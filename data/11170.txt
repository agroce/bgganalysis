RATING: 10
Played this with Nate, who has a bunch of extra stuff, and had a really good time.  I think just the basic set will tide me over for awhile, since it does take a while to set up and that limits its easy playability.  Still, a very cool miniatures game for people who don't want to play miniatures games. 


Update--a smash hit.  Brilliant game that makes me feel good about spending money on expansions.  Call it whatever you want, but my hats are off to Hasbro for making a game system that can exist in a mainstream store and still be little kid, long afternoon fun.

RATING: 8.5
A light and easy miniatures game enjoyable by gamers and non-gamers. What makes it cool is that it has fantasy things, the Men in Black, army dudes, robots, and samurai, ALL IN ONE!!!  How cool is that? I could probably use my warhammer40k minis for this, too. This game would be great for anyone who would like a miniature wargame that is light, easy, relatively short and inexpensive, and doesn't require arts and crafts skills (or just doesn't have the time for it, anymore).

GREAT game -- fixes things that are broken with the "clix" games. Simple, yet with enough strategy to give older gamers something to do on game nights! The terrain purely ROCKS!

Why did I buy into the hype? Just a simplistic miniatures game. And I don't like miniatures games. I do like how you assign actions to your units, but in the end this is more a toy than a game.

If you liked to play with little plastic characters as a child, and were sad the day you realized you did not "know" how to play with them anymore, this game is for you!

-Heroes of trollsford
-Vipers and Greeks
-Shades and Orcs

Too light, i'm sure it would probably be higher except my only 3 games of it, were rather lousy, bad dice rolls, being tired, and 1 of the games took forever because we decided to play with 6 people.  fun in theory, but in reality i never feel the urge to pull it out and setup.

RATING: 7.5
Totally solid and fun game.  Very simple but yet has some interesting strategy.  I'm not much of a wargamer, but this one satisfies me completely as it has a pretty quick rate of play and doesn't have long moments of boredom.  You always seem to be doing something or attempting to plot something.  It's like Warhammer light, which is exactly what I want.  Excellent game, bad drafting and awful rolls can doom you early in the game though.

RATING: 10
There's more strategy to this game than people give it credit for.  Those who disagree haven't played it enough, because I felt the same way initially.  

There absolutely is a lot of dice rolling, but what about the glyphs? height advantages? movement advantages? army construction?  You can easily win or lose based upon good and bad tactical decisions.

It's lighter than the hardcore minis games for sure, but it's also more fun and cheaper.

2008-03-12: I like Heroscape, but it takes so long to set up.  I suppose that's part of the fun, though.  Still, it's a bit of a detractor, and it takes up quite a bit of space.

Truly a toy with wonderful plastic terrain - which has been begging to be made for years. The game is a basic move-roll-attack-repeat affair with some mixed in special rules for the figures. Nothing unexpected at all. Not that I actually *play* the game by the rules. Oh, I've done that once or twice. But the better game is with our own rules - combining Mage Knight figures which adds a boat load of strategy - which this game desperately needs. Get it for the glorious bits. Don't get it for the game.

I love this game. The only thing preventing me from playing it every day is that set up and clean up take FOREVER. Usually we will set up a map and leave it out on the table for a few weeks and get lots of plays in before we have to deal with the arduous process of putting it away. 

The base set includes enough for several different scenarios and there are some good map suggestions included. If you get more tiles and characters you can create your own maps and scenarios and strategy will change depending on the armies you pick. 

I really enjoy the gameplay of the master version over the basic game since it adds special attacks and hitpoints so strategy needs to be greatly changed. Basic is a great starter for kids or people who are difficult to teach, but master is where it shines.

I own 2 of the master set and several expansions and character sets.

Sheer gaming bliss.

[i]This[/i] is the AT game I've been looking for. It plays fast, it's got simple rules, it lends itself to some strategy, it's infinitely variable and configurable. It's got dice dice dice and luck luck luck. 

I mean, where else can you have your zombie army charge into battle behind a pack of flayed plague dogs, backed up by a squad of Redcoats, an acid-spitting dragon, and a railgun-toting robot? To combat the U.S. Airborne, a squad of cybernetically enhanced gorillas, Captain America, a squad of Roman archers, and a pack of wolves? It's tabletop madness.

Just a classic...novel terrain system, elegant combat system and endless replayability.  The theme is very good as well, although a little juvenile, but this is a very good game for all ages.

It also endures because its simple gameplay nevertheless incorporates the right amount of detail without losing sight of why boardgames exist -- to be fun!

Pros: I like the combat and terrain system. It's nicely done. Excellent figurines that go with it.

From the Reviews: It is clear that there is a rather zealous following for Heroscape, but it is just not for me, lots of dice, mixing warriors from different time, minatures. I would have to be talked into this game from a gamer that I trust before I would try it

RATING: 7
A reasonably fun miniatures game with lots of cool pieces. Great to have around to play with younger kids, or with adults who feel like something light. 

Long setup time, and the basic game can get pretty tedious, but the master game is kind of like a simplified (but better looking) Duel of Ages.

Very hard to pack away once it's open, due to the box being too small!

The game I waited my whole life to play.  The Lego aspect of the terrain.  The 3D aspect of the terrain.  The melting pot of units.  The almost infinite possibilities for custom scenarios, game play, and homebrew additions.  Thank you may I have another!

Never played this one before, but someone was hosting a table for it and a friend of mine and I thought it looked interesting. The host knew his way around the game very well and was an excellent instructor. The hilarity of my kilted Scottish hero taking down a gigantic battle mech with a sword was certainly fun. The game came down to the last unit for the three of us, all fighting to the death at the top of a lava (magma?) mountain. An incredibly fun experience that I'd love to play again, but the storage and setup looks like a nightmare. I'm happy to play someone else's setup that's for sure.

Rating is based on my buddy's collection and he has just about everything.

This is not the best game in the world, but it is by far the coolest.  Why?  Because in my first game, I had a hoard of zombies fighting alongside soldiers from the American Revolution and a squad of U.S. Paratroopers.  I was going up against Hellhounds, Elven archers, and the Men in Black.

Nuff said.  This is this coolest game ever.

I know: you are supposed to coordinate your units so their special abilities work with each other.  Ho hum.  This game is about picking pieces based on how cool they look, having a crazy (yet very simple battle) and then telling stories about it months later.  It is all that is good in gaming.

+ Building and combining your army is great fun; Really captures your imagination.
- The tactics in the game a just a little weak; Takes up way too much time to set up and space to keep it set up.


Why it's previously-owned:
While this game was very interesting, engaging, fast-paced, and all of that, in the end, you either had to want to play this game all day or not at all, and I've got too many other good games to want to play this all day.
I traded away my Heroscape for Lord of the Rings, Colosseum, and Lord of the Rings: Friends & Foes.

Don't judge this by it's cover. It may be suitable for kids, but it's much more than that. 
This is the perfect skirmish game: I can explained it in minutes, and everyone can play without consulting the rulebook afterwards. Best of all: the expansions add variety, but the Master set still has the great units, it's not just a starter-kit. People that are complaining about luck of the dice have not played enough. Luck is a factor but it's more important to choose the right units, position them optimally and activate them at the right time. Don't just play last man standing though, that's a slugfest in every game, play a good scenario or CTF.

1st play: I set up the intro board and played with the beginner rules and my 5 year old loved it! He played with the minis for 30 minutes on his own, and had a blast making Iron Man and Dr Doom fight. Given that we're still playing basic rules, plenty of room to learn the advanced size. Great first impression.

2nd play: I played again with my 5 year old, this time with Valkyrie and Marvel mixed together. Captain America and the Vikings vs Red Skull and the undead samurai. Still playing on the basic mode but with a much bigger/more interesting map, and enjoyed the game. I sold Descent 2nd Ed. to pay for the Heroscape stuff and I'm not regretting it one bit.

Le retour des petits des avec des cranes.
Ce bon vieux systeme de heroquest est toujours en vie!

Beaux jeux, pleins d'expensions et de possibilites.  Le board est un puzzle hexagonal sur lesquelles les pieces se deplacent pour s'affronter a celles de l'adversaire.   Il y a plusieurs scenarios et conditions de victoire. 

La magie est dans la collection des differents personnages qui ont leur propres statistiques, forces et faiblesses et dans leur utilisation strategique en fonction de leur utilite et de le cout.

After a nice 6 month grace period of owning this game, the intial glee I got from all the nice bits and pieces seems to have worn off. The gameplay on this one, while fun and lighthearted, is rather lacking. Unit drafting is predictable. The play is controlled predominately by luck. I would suggest it as a light non-gamer game, but in my opinion the set-up time, the pricetag, and the storage space required for this one bring it down a notch.

This game is one of the few, rare perfect 10 scores I will likely ever offer. The reasons are many but this game seems to fit my desire for a game to be simple, to incorporate miniatures, and to be new each time it is played. With all the expansions, many still readily available, this game is almost assured to never be the same game twice.

This game is just great. Its only drawback is that the just the core game itself is not enough to play - oh it technically is, but you'll quickly realize that you wont be happy playing on a flat board. You'll want rises and cliffs and hills. I dont deduct a point for this (whereas I do for other games that are not complete in the box) because it is NOT expensive to pick up some additional terrain.

Great game. Map building and army building add great replayability. My initial impression was "Risk meets D&D", but I'm sure a lot of fans would disagree.

I have this game as the base game, plus some additional units and land/castle tiles from booster packs & expansions.  This game is amazingly innovative, and packs the flare to surprise your standard RPG expectations.  It has simple rules for kids, but the real game is with the advanced rules.  While the rules aren't anything to write home about (more dice rolling, and hit points, etc), the fact that the scenarios, playing fields, castles (expansion), and general landscape are entirely customizable is genius.  Combining the thrill of legos, with RPG wars.  Where it stumbles is all the stuff after that, the rules are sometimes messy, and combat is surprisingly not innovative or inspired.  And therefor the game is a one trick-pony, but a good one trick pony at that.

RATING: 6
Pretty fun.  The best thing about it is the actual minis/terrain you get, which are pretty affordable and easy to use.  Creating a nice gameboard to play on with only a little time is nice.

The gameplay itself is a little weak, but by no means bad.  There's a decent amount of tactics needed to win, and having some luck DEFINITELY wouldn't hurt.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Great bits & balance with wonderfully streamlined play.  Quick and tidy tactical game.  A bit more meat would bump up my rating, but at the same time might detract from the game's focus and speed.  Also, a big plus is the amount of online support offered through various fan sites.  Downside is the investment to grab all the armies and terrain, plus storage is a bear.

RATING: 6
really appreciated this one more after playing memoir '44.  with the 1/2/3/bluff turn selection and variable character powers, i think this one is both more strategic and more fun.  fantastic production quality, great bang for the buck.  i never want to bring it out though, and it's not because i'm intimidated by the map-building.  i think that bit is exaggerated, and it's easy enough to leave one put together.  i'll probably look into the marvelscape version.

One of the greatest board games that I've ever had the pleasure of playing. Even with just the first master set, an insane amount of creativity is possible (and encouraged), and with each additional expansion set, the possibilities only keep on growing. The only downside to this game is the high price that resulted from its cancellation.

There is some really cool strategy/tactics with the special abilities and terrain, however, the sheer number of figurines and their states and special abilities to remember can be kind of overwhelming.

I soloed this game twice, and I absolutely detest it.  Don't get me wrong.  The quality of the figurines is exceptional, the battle mechanics seem solid, and the expandability feature appears to be endless.  This game just isn't for me.  It seem to me that to really get the most out of Heroscape, you would have to spend tons of money on expansions and craploads of time designing landscapes.  No thanks.

Toy meets game in an epic tabletop experience! You can't go wrong with Heroscape if you like tactical miniature games. Kids of all ages love it; younger ones just want to play with the toys, older ones appreciate the freedom to create their own armies and develop their battle strategies. Building the terrain, the mash-up style of army building, the streamlined yet non-limiting gameplay -- it all adds up to one of the best all-around medium-weight battle games of all time!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Initial Impression: The production value on this game is through the roof. I don't know which part I enjoy more, playing the actual game or building the maps. I bought this game for my son so that we could grow into it together. The tactical minis game is simple yet surprisingly deep as certain squads can support each other and the synergies created can be very powerful. Building out our Heroscape collection, especially since it's out of print, will be a whole other game for my son and I.

The price just can't be beat too!

RATING: 8
Plastic overload! Wonderful playing pieces in a crappy box. The game is tabletop light (e.g. comparable to 'SW Epic Duels'). Very light. And fun. If you can't stand to loose because of a bad dice roll then look somewhere else. People which already have some ideas about new settings and figures they want to play should buy this...

RATING: 10
I've played and collected enough Heroscape now that I can safely rate it a 10.  The game is fun, building maps is fun, building armies is fun, trying to figure out how to effectively use bad units is fun...  The only bad part about this game is storage, and how it has eclipsed my other gaming spending.  Now that it is OOP, my current storage needs will suffice.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
My buddy bought this just after it was released to Canada.  We were super excited to play and even moreso when we opened the box to look at all of the marvelous bits and terrain.  But the gameplay itself did very little for me.  We've tried all of the scenarios on Advanced and only one holds any interest for me.  As much as I enjoy rolling dice and the theme, it becomes quickly repetitive and lacks strategy.

An excellent introductory wargame for teenagers, one that a father or older brother can definitely enjoy. It has plenty of strategy, specially in the army draft phase, it plays relatively quickly, and has beautiful painted miniatures. One of the best games sold at Toys 'R Us!

Outer box shows shelf wear on most edges and corners, with one corner showing a one inch tear.  Inside, all components are complete, with tokens, dice, figures, glyphs, order markers, and army cards bagged.  Being the 2nd edition, water pieces are NON-sparkly.  All correct terrain pieces are present.  Rule set looks to be handled and read, while an army card or two are not perfectly flat.  Clearly been played with, but in good shape.  Planning on putting it in a no ship Math Trade in March, but if the right offer comes along, would be willing to ship it within the lower 48.

My boys really love the miniatures.  I enjoy them myself, and appreciate the individuality of them.  Game play is okay, and we all enjoy creating a unique game board.  Many of the expansions are eyecatching, but as a wise fellow gamegeek pointed out,  I too wish they made the game deeper rather than just wider.  [Market price]

RATING: 7
Gorgeous light wargame. Brilliant modular terrain but units die way too easily. Setup takes a while. Needs a storage solution, boxes inadequate. Can spend hours creating multi-tiered environments to fight in. Id like it more if all units were from a single time period or theme. Heavy die reliance.

I bought this one to play in 'basic' mode with my 6-year-old son. He quickly learned which minis were the most powerful and now insists on picking 'fair' teams before any match starts.

I actually own two sets of this, because Toys R' Us was doing some strange two-fer as a marketing thing early on.  Rudy said he would buy the other one off me, but he has not, so it is just sitting there in the garage.  I think I played it once or twice, and had fun, but the setup was a bit of a bear, and I am not sure how I feel about the whole mish mash of themes.  Robots shooting rockets at samurai running from orc ridden T-rexes?  The game itself seemed fun, and could be immersive, and the terrain is an absolute blast to look at and play with, but I just feel there is other stuff out there I want to play instead.

If this had came out when I was a boy, I think my whole childhood would be different. This is the game that I've always wanted to play. Simple rules. All sorts of different guys beating each other up. And an almost lego-like map system for creating your own maps.
Things I don't like about the game:
1) Takes a while to set up a map. I'll usually have to set up a map ahead of time and leave it out. Custom maps are fun to make, but it's a lot of work to make them balanced for a really good game. 2) Would be nice if there were more ways to win, rather than just beating each other up. Again, you can make a custom scenario, but it takes work to make it balanced. 3) I've spent a lot of money on it. It's probably about half of the value of my total boardgame collection, but it doesn't come close to half of the playing time. Although, once my boys are older, I'm sure it will get a lot more play.

Edit: Bumped rating down a little bit. Lately, I've been wanting to play things like Monsterpocalypse instead of this.

Edit again: rating bumped back up. Kids are older now and we play this almost every chance we get. The maps still take a long time to set up, but we build them together and have a lot of fun with it. We don't worry about making it balanced. Just make something interesting and try it out.

Sadly I have not played this one as yet, while it seems fun and I am sure I will like it a lot, I can see that there may be some depth issues with even the master version of the game, since I have no shortage however of nephews with which to play, I have every confidence in the purchase, it looks very good and the deep pockets of the publisher have only served to help this franchise get, if nothing else, TONS of add-ons for re-playability, I will play this soon and level my score however.

MiniaturesGame, Solo

The rules are simple, the terrain is great, and the armies are crazy.  It's a dicefest, but it's a strangely enjoyable dicefest.... and the components are great.  Looking forward to the expansion, whenever I can get it.  I actually have two copies of the game, which is enough for me.  I am considering a third copy....
  
I keep this game around because it's a great *light* miniatures game, with great production values and a three-dimensional playground.  Even if I never got the expansions, this game would have a lot of replay value.  Sometimes I even regret getting the expansions, due to a desire for simplicity, but they certainly don't hurt!  Great for kids young and old.  ;)

At this point it's pretty much a given that I will end up owning all the sets, occaisonally mutliple copies of.  Not abut to mark every expansion as owned, which will be as numerous as the Blue Moon expansions (or more so) in the end.

The game that created a resurgence for my love of board games. I have many fond memories of playing this game with my sons when they were younger. Some of the enjoyable aspects were building your armies, building the terrain maps, collecting the figures and heroscapers.com. Since then I have outgrown it, but I recognize that it was a tremendous tour-de-force back in the day.

I had lots of fun going on "hunts" for the figures with my boys!

HeroScape is more than a game.  It is a building set, it is collectable (but NOT blind--the only way to go), and it is expandable through official expansions and limitless house rules.  I really almost have more fun with this game building the boards and planning new scenarios with different house/scenario rules and collecting all the expansions.

Oh, and the game is pretty fun, too, although it might be just a tad light on strategy.

UPDATE: still love this game, but I think I may be done "collecting" it.  I don't like what WOTC has done with the D&D integration.

Never, ever play this with adults, there are so many better games to play.

However, this is perfection for young lads. The landscape, the figures, the simple rules, the special powers. My boys love it and I intend to use it to get their friends into gaming too. You get a hell of a lot of plastic for your buck.

The system is as much a kit as it is a game. It rewards active committment. To get the most out of it, you should develop your own scenarios and campaigns with friends. Fortunately, the learning curve is low and you don't need everything to have a great time. Playing Heroscape is half the fun. The rest is in composing units, playscapes, and scenarios.

THE BEST GAME OUT THERE.  There are drawbacks: availability, cost, space for storage.  But the game has ENDLESS replay value, limitless and easy modifications, and heroscapers.com has cards for every super hero, movie character, cartoon character, video game character, etc., that we continue to add to our games.  The interlocking hexes permit maps limited only by space and tile availability.  We have a big table and a lot of hexes, and so have epic games.  For a period of about four years we only played Heroscape, and kept records and had playoffs. GREAT game, we still play and are still adding figures.

Too many special powers, terrain modifiers and line-of-sight situations for my liking.  Picking team members should be fun, but it's a chore for me (lots of text on the cards).  The massive dice rolls that frequently result in feast or famine (all hits or no hits) drive me nuts.

RATING: 10
Basically a perfect execution of this kind of game. Tons of great components for the price, and big fun. The rules are simple enough to grasp quickly and easily calculate the odds of various strategies. There is a significant luck element to the rolls -- this is a laughing shouting battle game -- not a deep strategy miniature game.

Best of all is the extra unit expansions that keep the game fresh and keep my group playing constantly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Universal combat game, where anything can fight anything, you just give it an attack, defence, move and range value, a size and decide any special rules that may apply.

You need a lot of terrain to make a large battlefield or achieve any relief, as the rules account for things 25 rows high, which is hard to do unless you buy lots of stuff!

Pretty simple game tho and the very nice, prepainted figures that come with the game mean that it is definitely a way to get kids in to the progression from "toy soldiers" to using a simple ruleset.

I bought this game as a Christams "set out gift" for my 9 year old. i was hooked as soon as i opened the box. Great looking miniatures, lego-like battlefield, simple rules. yet it is every bit a miniature based skirmish game. I would rate this game a "10" for anyone with a son under 12 who wants to play and enjoy miniature wargames. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
My rating for this has nothing to do with the actual game, and everything to do with the game pieces as being useful for using in other systems.

There are people that will torch me for this, but I think the Heroscape game mechanics stink. I have yet to play a game where it didn't come down to the dice being finicky in one person's favor and screwing the other.

After a 45 minute set-up time I think that's a bit like flipping off a box of kittens. Just plain wrong.

I love the concept, production values, and pieces, but the game itself annoys the crap out of me. I have been trying for 3 years to come up with an adequate mod of the rules to satisfy the Battletech / Twilight Struggle fan in me and make it less about luck and more about strategy.

If anyone has any suggestions, please feel free to PM them to me.

RATING: 7.6
After Memoir '44, my eye fell on this. It contains all the elements, plus a third dimension (hight). The eclectic fantasy theme and the toy like aspect of the game (first you need 45 minutes of lego like terrain building), makes it hard to get into for some crowds. But the gameplay is absolutely fun! The initial startup time is the main reason why it does not get any table time recently.

Bit timeconsuming to setup and put away, but generally worth it. I think I'd prefer it with historical units and more options to move most of your army - but heroscape is really a small unit tactical game, I prefer large scale battles (battalion level for example)

This was an impulse buy.  I read about it here on the geek and saw it at Kmart for clearance at 20 bucks so I picked it up.  It's decent but honestly after the first couple plays it hasn't hit the table.  Some people enjoy the set up, but I don't.  I don't like the game enough to get a pay off from the enormous set up time.  

Maybe I need more of the expansions to get the full experience of this game.  I just don't see myself investing in this game though.  I can definitely see the appeal for the right person, unfortunately I'm not the right person.

The setup for the map always makes me hesitant to bring this beast out.  It would get more plays if it didn't take so long to set up!  But once out it is a blast to play.

For what this is, it is a lot of fun.  No deep strategy, no wooden meeples and tough efficiency decisions --- just lots of miniatures, lots of dice, and lots of killing.  Add in lots of customizable terrain and basic ( 6- 8 year old) and master (7+ years old) versions and you have a game that is fun solo, with friends, and with kids.  Gotta love it.

Need to pull this out again for my son.

Adult Play = 7.5; Kid Play = 9;

An OK game that the 9-year-old really enjoys.  Probably best to set up the scenario on a table where it can be left out for a week at a time, rather than wait for an opportunity to set up, play, and take down the game.

I picked up a few of the master sets on clearance and sold them (thus "previously owned").

The figs and terrain are really, really cool.  Feels like a 12 year old's dream toy - I wish I had had this game as a kid.  The game itself is a combination of obvious moves and not-so-obvious moves.  There is often a best fig, and you pile all your order tokens on him and blast away at your opponent.  However, since you place order markers and then roll initiative, you have to plan for the possibility of going second or first.  This is where the decisions, such as they are, come in.  Drafting is also quite strategic, with lots of good decisions and counter decisions.  Ultimately, the game is not deep, but can be appreciated for what it is: a light hack and slash affair with great bits.

This should be the standard for American games (just like games like PR and Settlers are the German standards).  Great miniatures and simply awesome terrain pieces.  The strategy isn't super deep but you need to make smart plays and roll well (get lucky).  The fact that the rules aren't fiddly is a plus in itself.  I kind of regret buying the Mission Command games for the great bits because this game has even better bits and rock solid gameplay as well.  This one parallels The Queen's Gambit in that I tried it because it looked pretty but discovered that there is also an excellent game underneath.  A great value at $40.

This... Well it's better late than never to have finally played it and to have realized how rad it is. My rating may start to fall soon because acquiring more minis is really hard these days (and the terrain has already been a huge investment). However, it really hits a sweet spot for my main group. As long as i have time to set it up, I could see this getting more plays than anything else in my collection this year. Will re-evalute in early 2019.

This game is everything I love and hate all mooshed together. There's little strategy and everything (EVERYTHING) depends on how many dice roll your way. Normally, that's a recipe for me hating the hell outta something. But the theme... the bits.... this game is SO MUCH FUN. It's like playing a comic book - a comic book where robots and zombies fight Vikings and world war 2 paratroopers, with dragons and Men in Black jumping around in there too. The miniatures are incredible (the paint jobs beat the stuffing out of Heroclix), and the amount of great-looking stuff you get for $40 is simply amazing. This is the best "bad" game I have ever played.

Same comments for my Marvel Heroscape set:

Great game, simple rules.  Love the simplicity of this system and the way the special powers manage to capture the essence of the theme.  Great fun!

There may not be much terrain in the base box, I bought two as they can be found quite cheaply, it is worth it - I am also looking at using this game at school, the kids would be wild about a game that is about this subject let alone a game that looks the way this one looks.

The simplicity of the game is a real bonus, everything in the game, from moving up, fighting and special powers are all logically handled within this simple framework.

The role of dice in this game is profound, if you are the sort of player who is turned off by a significant amount of luck then this is a game that you would be better off avoiding, however, if you can live with this strong element of luck this game is thematic and a rollicking adventure.  The best part is it doesn't outstay it's welcome.

Rise of the Valkyrie is a great set because it contains a fantastic mix of units, from heroes to squads, as well as a massive amount of terrain - very much worthwhile!!

The bits are terrific, but the game itself is a just sort of OK -- a light war game with several scenarios that aren't really as interesting as I hoped. Not everyone will agree with me, but I felt there weren't enough "small" units, that the heros were sometimes a great bargain, and that the squads and some of the unique bigger units are overpriced. Also, point values seems to have been artificially inflated by a factor of ten. I'd rather have my samurais worth six points than sixty, and so on. I'd also go ahead and skip the basic rules and jump right in with the full rules. I don't see it getting much play with only a single set, but I can see how multiple sets and the many expansions could lead to a much more interesting game with lots more variety in the scenarios.

A very entry level minatures games. A good deal of minis come with it and there a tons of expansion packs that you can purchase as well.  The buildable terrian is a nice touch.  Sometimes the terrain building can end up being more fun than the game its self.

As a fan of Hero Clix, I rather looked forward to this experience. What I found was a fast-pace, easy-to-understand game where the tide can turn in an instant. It's two advantages over Hero Clix include the more sturdy, easier-to-work pieces and the more dynamic/challenging terrain. I thoroughly enjoyed this game, and would recommend it to any fantasy or miniature geeks.

This game is responsible for so many good times, memories, and friendships.

It's a shame this got discontinued, I think it could have gone on forever and not suffered for it.

I have an almost complete collection of every official Heroscape item.

The amazing terrain system, the direct but deep rules, and the great replayability make this one of the best games of all time.

RATING: 8
Highly recommended for anyone with kids, aged 7 and up, who like to build.  I actually got into it more than my son, but we've worked out a system; I spend an hour or two creating an interesting scenario, and my husband and son play them out.  

Ten months after buying: I lowered the rating because we never take it out.  Of course, I've got so many sets that it seems like more of a hassle than anything else to deal with it.  

Maybe the key is keeping it simple.   

UPDATE: My son pulled it out this summer, built a couple of scenarios, and he and his dad really enjoyed it.  It's back up to an 8.

UPDATE 7-30-12: Man, I really need to sell this system.  It takes up massive space in our house and we never play it.  I have so many base sets and expansions, it's ridiculous!  I look back on a comment I made from a couple of years ago about keeping it simple, and I highly recommend that.  You can have plenty of fun with one base set and maybe a few extras.  Don't get roped in by all the crazy pictures of scenarios you see online.  Play the base at least 10 times. If you feel the need to expand, do it gradually.

Basic Game:  easy enough for young children, yet will engage adults somewhat.

RATING: 8
Initial rating of "9." With about 2 years of gaming under my belt, I was suspicious that I was a relative Eurogamer "centrist." Sure, there are a few oddball games that I really enjoy, but for the most part, the few classic "Ameritrash" games that I played left me underwhelmed.

If Heroscape is Ameritrash, then I am totally on board. This is fun, hilarious, absurd in its total genre mish-mash, and fairly strategic. There's a bit of "deckbuilding" with your army construction, a bit of Memoir '44 with the army movement and dice rolling... it's just a wonderful blend of figures and gaming.

Thank goodness I have a close couple/friends that have fully invested in this game. I can't see myself ever picking this up, but I'm more than happy to help them get as much mileage out of this game as I can.

RATING: 7
I'm a sucker for games with hexagons on them.

I've not played many fantasyish/warrish boardgames, but I think this has been my favorite of the ones I have played.  In general, my standards for this kind of game are relatively high, I think, because if I really want to pound goblins into the ground, I'll play something like D&D, which has many more options and more development than a fantasy hack-and-slash boardgame.  Granted, a full-out tabletop RPG is much harder to learn than a game like Heroscape, but if one already knows many of the rules, why not?

Excellent miniatures game w/ fun "basic" rules and even better "master" rules that are not really that much more complex.  The quality of the miniatures is top notch.  The only downside would appear to be the long setup time for the battle maps and the fact that most battles are no bigger than squad-sized engagements.  I prefer playing games where you choose your units using the point system to ones having preset armies.

Actually have two copies, which I've combined. One was thrifted from Savers (95th and Nall in KC) for $8 (IIRC) and needed some bits to complete it; the other was purchased new and sealed from Paula Murray at "Snowflake" in February, 2011 for $30. I gave away the extra figures and bits (dice, cards, markers, etc.) to a deserving gamer whose kids really wanted to play the game, but he only had a partial set.

I own 5 base sets and 2 of every expansion.  Full, light game, though it cries out for house rules.  Ranged figures too powerful, line of sight needs wargame-type tweaking.

Also, with no expansions rates maybe a 7, even with kids.  This game needs a huge collection to really shine - it can be almost a hobby unto itself.

This one is cool!  Great for all ages especially parent gamers  and their kids.  Part of the fun is building your own game board out of the terrain tiles; the another part is pairing up your army and seeing how it does.  Yes, there is dice rolling to resolve combat, but it is quick.  Lot's of possibilities for a fun time.  Games move quick.  Syvarris rocks!  It gets even better with each expansion!

I hear heroscape will be discontinued.  Not for me.  I expect this game will be in the hearts and minds of many a geek for Decades to come.

Great fun and great bits.  I doubt I'll play the game all that frequently, but it's enjoyable when I do.  That being said, it's not among my favorite miniature skirmish games such as Necromunda or Confrontation.  I'm not sure if playing with more of the expansions would help that or not.  However, I have hijacked the high quality pieces a number of times for Dungeons and Dragons, which adds much to its value in my eyes!

The primary attraction of this game is its constructible terrain. However, the terrain would be excellent for other miniatures games if the hexes were smaller. The plastic miniatures themselves are of decent quality. From my limited experience with this game (I have only played with the base set), the rules and strategies are rather simplistic. It would be a decent "filler" game if it were not for the relatively long setup and breakdown times.

RATING: 7
Although I am interested in a what appears to be a dynamic and strategic game which stores like Walmart and Target actually carry, in the end it seems too simplistic to me, and there's not enough strategy involved to satiate my desire in a fantasy/sci-fi board game. What does save this game is the extremely high quality terrain pieces, which lock-in with one another to create an amazing game board, and which is great to combine with other Miniatures war games, without the otherwise huge cost associated with creating and building your own terrain.

What a pleasant surprise!  If you hate Duel of Ages because of the gameplay, I doubt you'll enjoy Heroscape.  But if you are attracted to the idea of a limited miniatures game, don't mind direct player conflict and love playing with legos (the terrain), you'll get some fun mileage out of Heroscape.  Its certainly not a deep game, but there is a bit of room for creativity as you draft combinations of heroes and execute a plan.  I can't help the comparisons to DoA.  Whereas DoA is a decent game with a knock on it for the components....with Heroscape you have about the same quality of a game with a brilliant bonus with the components.  The blind move programming is a nice touch.

This would have been my favorite game when I was 13 if it had been around then. Doh!

It's a child's game.  Really.  A young adult or adult should be playing a real miniatures wargame like Warmachine if they want to appreciate all that's good in this game... only for real and for better.  It does have glorious bits, but then, that's it really.  One has to wonder if this game would have even hit the radar if it didn't have the fancy toy parts.  But with coin flip mechanics and super simple game play, I just don't have the appreciation for it that many others seem to have.

This is a great game for younger kids (7-14).  You put together your own landscape, and then draft men and/or creatures to fight with.  I want to like this game more, but just can't.  It takes more time to set this game up than any of my other games.  For the amount of time you put into it, it  just doesn't have enough strategy or fun.  That being said I do have four master sets, lol.    If I was rating this game for kids I would give it a 9.

Components are nice. Building the board is a great feature. Easy combat system that allows for easy addition of special abilities. The expansions are very pricy and designed in a way that makes you buy more than you need to. No way I will be able to keep up with this game.

Likes: The painted miniatures are great size and quality. The rules are pretty simple and is actually fun for a dicefest. The theme allows for the game to have ridiculous juxtapositions. This would be the game that I point to as the one that started the whole board game craze for me.

Revised comment- original follows!

A couple of years on, and my enthusiam for HEROSCAPE has waned a lot- tons of expansions, new figures from every nook and cranny of the imagination, gamers using 2, 3, 4, 5 sets to make gigantic, floor-covering games...yet somehow I feel that as a game HEROSCAPE never really met its potential to develop into a more comprhensive and progressively complex system.  The new figures add new abilities and a couple of kinks but ultimately gameplay returns to the same things we were doing when the game first came out.  Don't get me wrong- I still think HEROSCAPE is a lot of fun, and I still believe that the game has likely birthed a new generation of gamers in the basements and dining rooms of the world but I rarely feel driven to play the game any more myself despite its significance.  I still rate it high, and I'm glad to jump in on a pickup game from time to time but I can't help but think that the game should have expanded "up" more than "out".
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
After several sessions, this is definitely a 10,I can see playing this for a long time to come.  This game is something else, possibly even "important"...congratulations to the Daviau/Van Ness/Baker team for getting this published and onto store shelves- Walmart has never seen anything quite like this.  Yes, a game with line-of-sight and terrain rules has arrived in mainstream retailers.  What's next? ZOCs and CRTs?  This is the perfect way to introduce "hobby" gaming to a mass audience- it's attractive, different, and at just the right complexity level to both attract new players and interest veterans.  Gameplay is amazingly simple (just a few steps up from Epic Duels) but the fun factor is through the roof.  Kids will play this game and remember it fondly 15 years from now.  Oh, and it features amazing miniatures.  My eyes popped out when I opened the box.  Can't wait for the Romans!

I'm not too interested in miniature battles, and this game is a super streamlined miniature battle game.  It's a big hit with my group, but I'm not blown away.

RATING: 7.3
I've played this about seven or eight times over the past year with my sons ages 7 and 10, and it has been ok, but at times it has felt like a simple probability test without a lot of choices to make.  Last night I played with a colleague from work.  We alternated turns building the map a piece at a time, then chose four interesting glyphs and randomly placed them on the board.

It was a blast!  I used Throgrim and another piece for defensive bonuses for Sylvarrus (sp), who kept trying to stop the crushing onslaught of the Zettian guards.  I sent my Samurai around the ruins to slice and dice the paratroopers, who were lobbing grenades at Thorgrim.  A lone viking stood guard on a  1 attack glyph and my remaining samurai tried to dislodge him to no avail.  Meanwhile Johnny Shotgun was picking off my krav maga agents with his six shooter, getting incredibly thematic dice roles.  Finally, the Marro meat puppets began regenerating and although I came very close Syvarrus could not detonate the Zettians.

Lessons learned: The paratroopers roll to enter the board every *round* not every turn.  Also, don't judge a game you've only played against young kids.  Finally, choose really good scenarios with objectives.

update: we have so many expansions that the thought of setting this up is exhausting.

Another update: We had this in storage when we went overseas for two years and it was great to break it out when we returned!

I might get the base kit one day. It has been sitting in Mr Toys Toyworld for ages for $30 (down from $80 or $90).

What I'd really like would be a few "complete" theme armies. Not some hodgepodge of a few of everything.

Fantastic game for my 8 y.o. son - he loves building things, he's a budding gamer - this is a perfect fit. After playing our first game, he decided that he wanted to create his own characters for the game and immediately whipped up a Lego robot which he titled the "Juggernaut of Destruction".  He has all the stats figured out - we just need to make up a card. :)
Rated from my son's perspective since he is a member of the game's target audience.  While I can see that this is a great game system, the scenarios just last too long for my taste and I'd rather play something else.

And the huge, table-filling 3d map covered in minis really adds to the game, giving it a huge toy factor that just makes playing it more fun.

The rules are wide, but not deep; there are a number of little things to remember, but they're all straightforward, and almost common sense. I taught the master game it to a ten-year-old without trouble, and he proceeded to teach it to his brother.

Only played the basic game so far, which is why I don't feel comfortable rating it. (The basic game would only rate a 5 or 6.) This is still just a hair beyond my five year old's capabilities--he can do all the mechanics, but very little of the tactical/strategic thinking yet.

The theme is utterly silly and disappointing; I try to ignore it.

Imagine if you will the lone remaining, and frightened Guilty McCreech as he looks over a battle-scarred field of his slain comrades. His head hangs. His gaze lingers on the chamber of his revolver. Only one bullet left. He grits his teeth. A tear. Suddenly, filled with a bloodlusty, blind rage brought forth from the torture of his ancestors Genghis Khan and Vlad the Impaler's souls which have sat dormant for thousands of years in the void, whips out is 6-shooter,and surgically bounces a bullet off of a rock face and threads it through a thicket of trees! The bullet pierces a stalking Dragon right in the eye and passes through the dragon's cerebral cortex, halting all hopes of motor abilities he might have once enjoyed. Guilty, jumps from atop the tree (that he obviously force-jumped to the top of) and wrenches the dragon's head off for good measure. He holds the head high and bathes in a cascade of the lifeblood of ancient magics. He pulls out the bullet in the dragons brain stem with his teeth. He grabs his junk and blows a kiss at the crumpled dragon-heap.

A rustling from above. A Shaolin Monk descends from the tree. Hand-to-hand combat ensues. Guilty is losing ground. No, not this way. He's come to far. He rips a mighty oak from its roots. Not unlike the way a giant circus tent stake is driven into the ground, Guilty heaves the oak atop the monk's head. The monk dodges, but not fast enough. The monk is pinned neck down beneath the mighty tree. Guilty's boot spur clanks into view. He crouches low, with the bullet still wet in dragon blood in his hand. Slowly, Guilty forces the bullet into the temple of the twitching monk. 

What's that? A glint of light atop a cliff face miles in the distance? Ah, it's the scope flair of the deadliest sniper of all time, Deadeye Dan. Guilty is in his sights. Not to worry, Guilty slowly retrieves the bullet from the monk, he stares defiantly  at where the glint of light came from. And in a very "I could give a damn" type of manner, guilty lobs the bullet high in the air and turns his back. It's been a long day. Guilty lights a cigarette with the dragon's heat glands. It's a long tasty drag off of the cig. He walks away from the cliff into the trees. He deserves some XXX Whiskey. He's gone. 

In the hazy distance, against the rocky backdrop of the cliff, we see a limp, lifeless black dot in free fall...


(THIS is my experience with this game. Never have I been more excited to lose a game several hours in the making. This game is so addictively fun. It's a game that you can get so involved in that every blow and victory feels like a personal tragedy and success respectively.)

One of my favorite games bar none. Very distinctive battlefield building system, multiple genres, and a wide variety of victory conditions to choose from. The rules are simple enough, but the special powers of each individual figure provide plenty of engaging wrinkles. Everything is great quality, especially the miniatures. Even at aftermarket prices, I literally cannot recommend this enough.

An excellent game that comes with two ways to play.  My young son can sit down and play the basic game with me, while other people can enjoy the master game and all the special abilities.  Building 3-d terrain maps to play on is a lot of fun as well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Irresistible for several reasons: prepainted minis, units from a mixture of genres, build-your-own-landscape. Very simple rules: I could teach an eight-year-old, so only four and a half years to go...

100127: Played first introductory game with 4.5yo son, using a very simple map and basic rules cut down slightly. His attention wandered at times, but he stuck through the annihilation of my forces and was rapt to be allowed to keep a Deathwalker 9000 to go with the Mimring and Grimnak I gave him a couple of years ago.

Where to start with Heroscape?!  The figures are great.  The play balance is superb.  You can have tons of fun just designing themed armies.  Building the map can be a chore, but can also be a ton of fun if you liked Legos as a kid.  And the cost of the packs are very low, considering what you get.  My kids love just playing with the pieces... can't wait to play the whole game with them in a few years.

This is one of the best miniature games I have ever played due to the simplicity of the mechanics and comparatively short play time.  I love that it only takes me around 15 or 20 minutes to explain the game to a new player.  My only gripe is the time it takes to build and disassemble the boards and the amount of storage space the game takes up.  Well, that is really my fault as I have purchased 8 copies of the game with at least 2 of every expansion.

Plus expansions

This may very well be the perfect game. The only reason I haven't played this in over a year is due to the fact that I had immersed myself in it for more than 2 years at the expense of all the other games in my collection, and I really wanted to get to those.

The minis and terrain are gorgeous, the units are incredibly varied and feel true to the characters they represent, the game has a perfect blend of strategy and luck, the game is easy to teach, and the game system is flexible enough to handle pretty much any house rules and customs you can throw at it.

Heroscapers.com is one of the friendliest and most talented communities on the Internet, and they have enhanced and expanded the system beyond imagination, particularly with respect to superhero customs.

One quip: I >hate< the weird 7-hex tile size of the cards in the game. Thankfully there are rectangular sized cards available.

Perhaps a bit high on the luck side, but the configurable game board and large community make this a good game.

This game really appeals to children of all ages. The rules are simple, but making decisions during the game can be tough. There is a surprisingly huge amount of different troops and abilities available within the system, with lots of synergies and combos. Also building the terrain before a game can be a fun experience on it's own.
Just ramped this one up to a 10, as I have been playing this for a year now and have not become remotely bored yet.
In 2008 it hit the table about 90% of the time. And that's for a player who plays games on a weekly basis.

One of my all time favourites - what's not to like?  A light to medium-weight combat orientated game with a theme that encompasses a myriad of genres.  You like Samurais?  Got them.  You like Dragons?  Got them too.  You like Romans, Robots, Zombies and Vampires?  Tick, tick, tick and tick.  You can play out skirmishes to large battles and a game in progress is a visual feast for the eyes. It comes with great expansions and has a dedicated and fervent fanbase. I could go on, but I think Truth said it best: "If you don't like Heroscape you are a Communist."

Heroscape looks absolutely mind blowing when compared to most board games. The 3D terrain is terrific and the pre-painted figures are very high quality. A fully set up game of Heroscape makes most other board games look dreadfully boring. So, very high toy factor here. The rules are very simple. It takes a few minutes to learn and then you can start playing. But while the rules are simple the gameplay still retains a good amount of both strategic and tactical depth. I recommend Heroscape for people who can handle and enjoy randomness and are looking for a great looking game that is as fun to set up as it is to play.

A basic tactical miniatures game with a clever map board that has infinite possibilities and oodles of great painted minis. I spent a ton on this when my kids were little and still have everything. Biggest drawback is the time needed to set up a game and then put it away...also, it's not portable due to how many pieces there are so I can't easily take it to my game group. Nothing looks as cool as a big, fun Heroscape map with armies of robots fighting cowboys and angels! There's not a lot to the strategy, but that's not really the point anyway.

Ultimate hack and slash non-collectible 'collectible' game.  Not necessary to buy blindly or even buy everything. Read up on the net which blister packs interest you and pick 'em them up. Actually the 1st master set has some of the best heroes in my opinion. What I love most about this game is the 3rd dimension of height used in this game and line of sight.

RATING: 8
Not brain surgery, which ain't necessarily bad in my book.  The tiles are perhaps the kewlest bit, with their ability to lock and stack, you can build some really interesting structures and battlefields.  The game is definitely on the random side of the spectrum, but it's still quite good for beer and puzzles...

I arrived far too late to this one from a cost perspective -- only made worse with the discontinuation announcement -- but what an amazing game. 

Can be played in so many variations: All the way from specific scenarios to theme-vs-theme battles to team vs team contests or massive free-for-alls. There's even the ultra-competitive tourney scene. Fans of strategy, wargaming, abstracts, and/or heavily themed Ameritrash can all find something to enjoy here. There are even those who buy the master sets just for the terrain and contruct phenomenal maps that are practically works of art. It really is a game that can be all things for *most* people (not quite all...those whose taste strictly favors eurogames need not apply).

**Have updated to a 10. Any game that has me thinking about it all day long shouldn't be rated any less. It's officially my desert island game.

Now that we own two master sets and one copy of each expansion, we really have at it! My son and I like to make up our own scenarios, build our own battlefields, and draft armies. Basic rules for now. This game is always set up in our house!

UPDATE: Now up to 3 master sets, plus one of every expansion through wave 6. Easily the most played game in our home! Rating just went up from 7 to 8, as we are now transitioning to the master rules (we are now using the advanced side of the army cards, and it really boosts the game)!

Well, after years of dodging the bullet on this one, it's simplistic fun has stuck it's hooks in me.  I've found myself hunting all over the metroplex in an effort to find more expansions.

OK...I got this for $50 on Trademe.co.nz (New Zealand's auction site) a few months a ago & HAD to wait for my Bday to open it! It's brand new and unopened until this morning which happens to be my birthday present! WOO HOO!! OK I haven't played it yet...but I'm basing my rating at 10 now just on the components alone and the sheer number of figures u get with the game & what I have read & reread here on BBG about the game.  WOAH look at the SIZE of that dragon! Hell my 5yr, 9yr 16 yr and me...ahem...a lot more years...& the biggest kid in the bunch...were in AWE! MY 16 yr old is at home and has played several scenarios already & he said it's a real blast! I need to go home now...I just need a great excuse to give my boss...BUT I'll be in late tomorrow for sure!! 
FUN! Emotional! Fast! Simple! Anything can happen! Use your forces wisely! ATTACK!!!!

RATING: 6
Light war game, notable mostly for being played with large figurines on a table-sized 3D board assembled from interlocking hexes.  AKA rules for playing with action figures, pretty much. 2-4 players, time 1-2 hours depending on how quickly setup goes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
About the coolest hex board I have ever played on!  I will definetely be using the board for other games, like BattleTech.  The game itself, I need to play a few more times, it's fast, and simple, and that might be where it doesn't hook me in it's own right.  But, at the same time, it is nice to get a game done fast and start again.  I like the play mechanic of deciding who your going to move a turn, up to 3 of your pieces, and that can be the same piece, or different ones.  Give it a try!

RATING: 10
What a deal. I'd buy it for the bits alone! The interlocking hexes will fit any ~25mm figures. The first thing I did was grab a figure from another game and made up some rules for it. Very simple game, although I recommend using the advanced rules for better balance. Very approachable and fast-playing.

RATING: 5
I found the gameplay only marginally up from what a kids have invented for themselves since tin soldiers were invented. A bit disappointing really. But it gets bonus points for shoving a lot of plastic into a box for a reasonable price. I'm looking forward to using the bits in other games.

Fantastic game. However I have taken to telling people to not bother buying it. I love it and will continue to play as long as I have it.

RATING: 2
I can't in good conscience rate this game on the quality of the parts, or on the potential of future expansions.  The game itself is a dull coin flip livened by beautiful figures and complex terrain.  The only interesting mecahnic is having to plan the next three turns ahead of time.  I can see that it is a great game to teach kids how to play games, but I don't need it for that.  A game that is kinda fun to play, but that doesn't grab you and make you think about it all hours of the night is the definition of a 6.

I bought this to play BattleTech on the terrain, and I expect to buy a second copy.  But that's all it does for me.

Update: After a few more plays this has to get lowered from a 6 to a 4.  Without overwatch or damage sloped over range or _something_ interesting, this game will sit on my shelf for the rest of time.  (Until the aforementioned BattleTech campaign starts.)

Updatex2: After playing Battletech with the actual full set of official maps, this terrain system is shown to be incapable of handling terrain complex enough to be fun.  Lowering from a 4 to a 2.  This is junk.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Excellent game for the 8-12 year range.  The terrain system is ingenious.  Set-up time is a little too long for it to see much time on the table except for with game nuts like myself.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Amazing looking game.  Interlocking terrain pieces are snapped together to form a 3D battlefield.  Players draft a force from a strange assortment of factions (Paratroopers, a Dragon, Samurai, etc) and whack away at each other on the battlefield.  The game systems are aimed directly at 12 year olds, but the concept, execution and presentation of the thing is simply amazing. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Customizing your team is really fun, and building the map is also fun in a way, but my initial impression after a couple of plays is that the overall setup time leaves the actual gameplay feeling a bit anticlimactic.  The battles are generally simple decisions followed by dice rolls.  It was pretty fun at first but got a little repetitive. I'm hoping that once I have some more figures, I can get more out of the special abilities of the units to make things a bit more interesting.  It also seems like the kind of game that would be much easier if you have someplace to leave a map set up.  For now I don't, but when my basement gets renovated...

[Van Ness/Daviau] Unlike nearly every other tabletop miniatures game, I can get anyone playing this is 30 minutes flat, from opening the box to taking the first turn. The simple rules, prepainted units, towering terrain, and generous starter box makes this a great package.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The best game of this type. The modular board in my opinion is what makes the game, setting it up is a sort of mini game in itself. Well I say mini game, it does take a while. This rating is for the entire system. The system is good, the game is strong and just plain fun. 

Chronic plastic purveyors Cmon should buy the licence for this and print it forever kickstarter or no.

Simply, shiney, and fun.  The expansions seem a little on the pricey side, but the base game is a good value.  The worst part for me is the time required to set up a battlefield.  In other circumstances that would be one of the most fun parts, as the terrain blocks are very cool, but my gaming time is currently too limited to spend too much time building the board.  I like the game and have a bucket full of figures, but I think I'm done buying expansions for this one.

Great Ameritrash game.  My son loves this, and I enjoy playing it with him.  The pount values for the cards seemed to be pretty balanced allowing balanced play.

Great terrain pieces make this a must buy if you play HeroScape; it allows you to build better battlefields.

I like this more every I time I play it, and it gets better with all of the expansions.

I record all plays of HeroScape (including [gameid=27976] and [gameid=24703] which I consider as large expansions) here as well, as the main entry for the game system.

This game would have caused me to skip school if they had it when I was a kid.  The modular terrain is fantastic and the minis are decent (better than HeroClix, not as good as Star Wars minis).  Lousy theme, but fun and light gameplay.   Probably the best intro game for miniature battles.

The 'bits' of this game alone make it worth a purchase.  The included miniatures have a suprisingly decent paint job, although nothing close to what a semi-talented painter can do.  Haven't played it much, but seems simplistic with just the basic set.  Still, light-hearted fun. 

UPDATE:  I don't play it much, so WHY OH WHY do I keep buying expansions?  So my kids can play it in 7 or 8 years?  Yeargh!

UPDATE 2: My kids are old enough to play. Still hasn't made it to the table. Why not? I don't know.

Not a RotV for trade, but various odds & ends. Inquire if there's something particular you want.

Not the chess/MtG crowd I used to be a TD for; this game attracts a different gamer. Go out & enjoy.

Light enough for non-wargamers, yet still tense and full of important decisions.  Doesn't get played much, usually by the time someone agrees to a game and we get the board set up they're ready to do something else.

I wish the expansions weren't so danged expensive.  You get a few tiles and some nice trees for half the price of the base set!  Of course, it was always thought the base set was a high cost-benefit ratio, so I guess it might have been their plan all along.

The game material in this game rates an easy "11", I have never seen such lush production value in a game, and for it's miniatures alone it can be fully recommended. The only concern is that there is not really much new going on here - if it was played with counters on a paper hex map many people would not look twice at this game. But for bringing new young fans to gaming this must be applauded for it's elegance and simplicity of rules while introducing many concepts probably realised better in other games.

Would love a chance to throw this down! (As of summer 2010) - Thank you tom Vasel!!! I played this once with my kids using the basic rules - UGH!!! awful... wrote it off until I saw your video review.  Now I think it is one of the best games ever made... What a difference a review makes!  I just don't see how the move and roll dice concept can be better executed.  What I love about this game is that the rules are inuitive and can be easily absorbed so that players can focus on PLAYING the game rather than consistently referring to a rulebook.

Okay so sometimes I get caught up in a pretty game before I've really had a chance to play it.  Heroscape would be that game.  While it is simplistic, the real genious of the game was the terrain and the ability to make some amazing convention displays with $1000 worth of pieces only the truly insane would consider purchasing.  However, I believe the game can be a lot of fun but you have to have the right mindset of player and realize that it is a game as much as a toy.  Maybe someday my kids will play with me.

Awesome bits and board!  For its price, you get a TON of stuff packed into the box that all looks aboslutely amazing when put together.  Definitely a head turner.  I'm not into the huge miniatures games like Warhammer and the like.  This small, easier to swallow version of those large games is perfect for me.  Not interested in the expansions (they're too expensive to be justified, in my opinion) but there's plenty you can do with the base game.  Only big negative feature: it's almost impossible to put everything back into its box.  Some folks have done it, but you have to be VERY creative to do so... and that's just a big no-no to me if you HAVE to be creative to fit a product back into its packaging.

RATING: 6
rules wise, absolute dicefest, minatures are extremly varied, paint jobs are fair, but better than you'd think.

Cost-wise it depends when you stop buying. If it is your only game then you gotta have them all, let your OCD run wild. However if you like to play other games. beware the cash-hungry creep of a couple hundred bucks a year.

The terrain is the real gem here, visually exciting and full of imagination, like Legos, but the time to set up and the storage space can become daunting after awhile.

A great gateway and easy-going group game.

After a while I got off the merry-go-spending go round, and I am happier for it

RATING: 7
This game is just pure fun. I think the thing that kills it is the setup time. Once built, the game just flies along. The mechanics are simple and because it is just two people slugging it out, even the kids seem to get through it without bickering. In the end it really just comes down to luck of the dice, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.

Play this one with my son.  Simplified the rules a bit, leaving off the engagement rules.  Would probably play more if it wasn't such a pain to set up and tear down.  Also, we usually just play slugfests to the death with no glyphs, so it often drags near the end.

A decent enough game. Lots of interesting armies and terrain-building options. Choosing hidden orders each round is neat. Too bad it all boils down to rather mundane tactics and lopsided dice rolling.

Love the terrain. Love the figs. Wish the rules were a bit more advanced. Perhaps I'm used to more detailed miniatures but this game is basic to the point of being too simple. Would like some more advanced rules and or house rules to beef it up a bit.

Although pretty good quality overall, I found it fatally flawed.  I hated the line-of-sight mechanic, as it is perfectly reasonable for two people to not be able to agree when it is on the edge.  I play games to have fun, not to argue about whether or not something is in line of sight.  Rules should be specific, not open to interpretation.

Bought on a whim because Argos were having a clearance sale and the models looked kinda cool.

The modular board idea is fantastic before each play you can build the board exactly as you want it... however it does take quite a long time to build said board therefore, as the gameplay itself is quick and simple this building (and subsequent packing away) of the board takes by far the most amount of time.

Game play itself is rather forgetable and thus with the large set up and pack away time there are other games i would much rather play in the time frame.

Lots and lots of chrome, or plastic in this case, with yet another attempt to create an atmosphere of conflict with confused analog rules (the sighting rules are never quite satisfying when it comes to minis but HeroScape's are even less so).  Dunno if anybody realizes how much gaming bang they could get for the amount of buck needed for this one but to this writer it seems obvious this money drag is not worth it.  I'm awarding points only because the components are top notch; the Lego feel of the map works particularly well.

RATING: 3
Sadly, one of the most interesting things about this game keeps it from seeing much table time: the interlocking terrain.  Set-up time is just waaay too long and trying to assemble a terrain "board" from the step-by-step guide for the published scenarios is tedious!!  

If I want to play this, it has to be at my house (I can't lug all this stuff to other folks' homes) and I need at least 30 minutes of "quiet time" to throw a board together.

The well-painted (for mass market) figures are really nice, as is the price for the stuff at big-box stores!

I've got a major quibble with one of the rules (height advantage), but other than that, a fair, LITE game.  I think it's the collector in me that enjoys the game; it's certainly not the rules as they are dicefest-central.

UPDATE: SOLD MY COLLECTION!!  Yes, I'm excited- I freed up 8 cubic feet of space in my house by doing so!!  Good grief!!  I can't help now but to look upon my former love affair with this game as, well, a bit...silly...

It's fun just getting all the pieces out of ths box.  Everythnig just looks so cool and full of "atmosphere".  I love the llittle painted figures and the dragon is awesome.  My son loves to play this with me.

Takes some care to put everything back in the same box.

Finally broke down and purchased a rolling cabinet with 3 large drawers.  We now store our Heroscape pieces in there.  We're currently using 3 base sets plus quite a few expansions.

Haven't played this one now in years, after our kid got into his mid-to-late teens.  Selling it would be a challenge because I have a LOT of expansion components.  Several drawers full and they are all organized into individual grouped bags.  Getting a proper inventory of this game would be a lot of work and the weight would make shipping difficult.  Probably will trade it away or sell it now that it's popularity at home has dropped.

I recently got to play Heroscape again for the first time in 5 years, and I'm pleased to report that it's still a 10 and possibly my favorite game of all time. It satisfies both my adult interest in strategy games and my inner 12-year old desire to play with toys.  Years after the line has come to an end, I'm still having luck introducing it to new people and finding experienced players who want to get together for big games. 

Of course, the setup can be a hassle, especially if you're using a lot of terrain.  Just make sure you give yourself plenty of time, and it doesn't hurt to work from a pre-made map. [url=http://www.heroscapers.com/community/downloads.php?do=cat&id=7]Heroscapers[/url] has lots of them.

[Children's Game, Miniatures, Science Fiction, Combat, Dice] [2P:3] Yet another addition to the Battleball/Battle Cry/Memoir '44/Betrayal class of light, random children's games. Interlocking tiles are interesting, but cute components don't improve the game system, which has little if any depth (anyone notice that there are no terrain effects?). More of a kid's assembly kit than a real "game game". Excellent choice if you need a game to play with your children, however. (In that case, it becomes an 8. The '5' rating is for playing it with adults, which everyone here on the Geek seems to be rating it at. I think it'll sink to a '4' later, assuming it ever gets played again. I doubt it...) **** UPDATE: Sunk to a 4... strike that, a 3, no reason to play ever again unless asked to by kids.

Great all-purpose terrain. The miniatures are good for pre-painted miniatures. 
However, it may just be me, but the game gets really repetitive after a while. Especially since there are pretty obvious figures to choose from. Honestly, making custom maps is funner than playing the game...

It's the kind of game that ask you to learn the characteristics of all the different characters in order to play well. It's also the kind of game where you're guaranteed you'll have a couple of debates over some fuzzy rules. Finally, it's the kind of game that can go one way or the other on the roll of a dice. For me, that should bring the rating down to at least a 5, but I'm unexplainably attracted to this one. Is it the beautiful lego-like pieces? The great looking miniatures? The importance of positional play? The somewhat simple rules? The quick gameplay? I can't tell...

RATING: 9.5
One of my all time favourite games and one that I think is very close (for me anyways) to mechanical perfection. The combat dice and order markers ensure that while a the better player and the one who pulls ahead will generally get the win, the player who falls behind and even is down to his last unit is still in the game and stands a chance of winning. Add onto that the point system for building armies and the very flexible terrain means you have a very deep game and never have to play the same situation twice.

I only have a couple (relatively) minor complaints. First is unless a melee unit has some sort of ability that gives it a boost versus ranged unit, it can be a bit too easy for the ranged units to destroy the melee before the melee can engage. Second, because common units essentially treat all squads as part of the same card, common units do not lose effectiveness as easily a unique units do (since a single unique kill reduces the number of figures you take a turn with instantly while the commons are not affected this way until they have less than one squad's worth of figures left). Finally, I wish the game had a little bit more hidden information involved beyond the order markers and glyphs.

Note, this rating and comment applies to Heroscape as a whole. I have a number of packs and expansions that I did not bother adding or rating.

I have come into Heroscape way too late, but I managed to pick up the first two master sets before they get crazy expensive.  The game is tremendous, far better than I thought it would be.  The dice combat is simple and intuitive. The terrain lends to much strategic placement.  Of course, the plastic bits are lovely.  I pretty have collected the whole run at this point.  I can't wait to teach my kids this game when they get older.

Bought 9/3/04. After two plays it rated a 9. A very FUN game. Certainly not a serious strategy game, but when taken as fun, it is a most enjoyable game and the terrain and miniatures add immensely to the value of the game. This game recalls the kind of game I dreamed of as a youth.
However...after playing it 6 times it is getting a bit burdensome to 1) set up, 2) draft, 3) put up. Thus, a one hour game actually takes closer to two hours - especially if setting up a 2 or more set game. Tonight it took us over an hour to set up the game (2 sets) & draft - 2 hours to play (3 players) - and 45 minutes to put up - a total of nearly 5 hours! We started at 6:30 and finished around 11:30. Though the game was fun, tense, and exciting - we felt we were "missing out" on the rest of the gaming in the room (5 games were played while we played one)! Thus - I dropped it back to an 8.

I love minis games, and have played Heroscape maybe ten times.  It's inexpensive and fun to play with kids.  Beyond that, this game is hugely overrated.  No possible way to customize gear or weapons on any unit.  Typically one special ability for each unit on its recipe card, and that's it.  Every single model in the game hits and auto-wounds on a 4+ and has a 5+ ward save.  Annoying plastic hex legos to set up & put away.  If you are used to playing other miniatures games, you will find this way too boring.  It's not a terrible game.  It's just that pretty much every other minis game is better.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A customizable war game?  This is a perfect "gateway" war game, and a rarity in that it's as much fun to set up as it is to play (sometimes moreso).

EDIT:  Bumped to an 8, this is one of those games that people will look fondly back on after several years' time.  Have no doubt that this will be the Talisman/Heroquest for the younger crowd, who will be seeking these later in life to recapture the memories.  And it's a fun game to boot!

Oh Heroscape. I so wanted to like you! Stephen Baker, it was you who invented HeroQuest, one of my first and favourite games. Battle Masters was next, and while light in strategy it was heavy in theme and plastic. Heroscape looked beautiful all set up. The theme behind it is pretty weak, but so what. However, with all the arbitrary special powers and mish-mash of characters, I just couldn't get into it as much as I wanted. When you boil it down, Heroscape is just another game where you throw dice at each other and keep your fingers crossed. Yes, those who memorize all of the characters' special powers and can manipulate their own special powers enough will be victorious. This takes a lot of game play. For those who are into light miniatures games, I can see why they love this. But I don't have the patience to learn the fine points of this game when in the end it's just a dicefest. When I play a dicefest, I don't want to have to know the game system like it was kin; I just wanna set up my pieces, and go gung ho on my opponent until they're bleeding. 10 out of 10 for component wow factor, but I think I'll stick with Battle Masters if I want mindless dice-kills, and HeroQuest if I want a richer theme.

And then we played it and were blown away by the elegence and quality of the experience. It is basically a board game version of Final Fantasy Tactics with lots of different expansion units to buy.  

Set up time is a bi*ch though.

I still adore this game. This might still be one of my favorite board games of all time. The components alone are legendary. I even use it for other systems like Battletech and DnD.

The turn order rule is a great way to play the game, feigning what units you'll activate first.

The more I play the game, the more I like it. I grew up playing with Legos and other building toys, so the customizable battle map aspect is a total plus. It's easy to learn and definitely a great game to play with kids. I've earned some serious cool points from my siblings playing this with them. :-)

A friend introduced me to this game and I was immediately hooked.  I have played or played against just about every set of this game.  Simple but fun dice rolling mechanics derived from classic HeroQuest.  The stackable 3-D map building capability is the only one of its kind that I am aware of and is highly customizable for HeroScape or any of your other miniatures-based games.  The theme is a little cheesy (Robots, Samurai and Cowboys, oh my!) but there is something here for everyone.

Went to Gencon and demoed this.  Was pretty much sold on it then.  Played a full game later at the con and was beaten.  Went over to the auction store and bought a copy. 
Each game moves quickly enough for my son to enjoy.  I have fun being a ref and a player with the kids.  I have gotten expansions (lava, forest, tower, & tundra.)   In comparison, trees and features make the game interesting in a three dimensional way.
I must admit this game sneaks up on you cost wise since there are so many interesting themed groupings.  I spend a lot of time waiting and searching for deals at stores.  I avoid purchases at list price.

I received this game for Christmas 2004 and love it.  I had never played a 'minatures' game but have always wanted to - I'm glad my first one was HeroScape.  Not to complex but yet has the ability to be.  Being able to create different scenarios and never play the same twice as well as the expansion possibilities are all appealing to me.  I could go on - great game!

Fun game with 2 or more people.  Rated it lower though because of cost + time to set up.  Also, as of this date, Heroscape is no longer in print.  Prices are even more elevated now.

Update: 3.11.13
I've had this for years now, started collecting it in 2007 or so.  Played it a lot early on--when there were friends to play along.  When I first got on bgg I rated it lower (6) because of the pain of setting up.  After returning to it, I'm raising the rating from 6 to 7 because even though set up is a pain, it really is such a good game when you get one set up.  Very unique.  

Update 7.26.14
Continues to see the table on a regular basis, and it continues to prove that it deserves to be up there with some of the best.  Changing the rating back up to an 8.  The set up issues I shared earlier can be alleviated by playing smaller maps, which the more I play, that's where I think the sweet spot is.

Update: 3.12.16
Okay, after years of play, and playing hundreds of other games I still just have a blast playing this and believe it deserves a nearly perfect rating because of that.  Plays so smoothly and virtually flawlessly.

[Original comment] I have played three games of this, two with 2 players and one with 3 players. I think it has the feel of chess on a more expansive scale. I see that this is going to be a classic, with all the potential for expansions, modifications, home-created scenarios, etc. It appears the future for this game is almost limitless. The 3-player game I participated in included a 7-year-old, a 36-year-old, and a 61-year-old, and we all equally enjoyed it. In fact, the final battle was between the 7 and 61 guys, with equal heroes. It appears to be a very balanced game with lots to consider during the play. The modular board is ingenious, with lots of potential for very creative landscapes.

May 2009 -- I do not own this game and haven't played it for the past four years, but it is an interesting game system.

This is the best "light minis" game I've encountered. Rules are clear and presented very well in the manual. The game system is smooth and provides many options ... and this game is FUN!

Another incomplete game, this is one of those titles that only get better the more you spend on it.  Even though this older master set has more pieces than the current master sets, its still not really enough to get the full potential out of this game.  

The game itself makes for a good light war game and I think if I owned many more sets, it would be much more a blast and more epic.  If this was the case I think I prefer this game over Memoir '44.  There are no cards to this game and I think this is a rare case where this game is better for it compared to Memoir '44.  I like card-driven wargames, they usually add much to the flavor of wargames, but in Memoir the card play is just a command mechanic and add nothing to flavor, but this game of Heroescape, skips that pretense and gets straight into the game.  

The 3D nature and variations in terrain is a boon also.  The game mechanics are simple compare to the usual grognard fare, but they simple work and work well.  

If I was to invest in this system now, I would do well to buy a large used collect with several master sets.  The new sets based on D&D are more expensive and you get %25 less tiles.

The few sets I own now, I can't rate this game more than memoir, which play better out of the initial box.  I am sure that will change if I ever decide to invest more in this system.

HeroScape may not be the greatest thing since pizza, but it's a very entertaining light skirmish-game. It looks out-of-superlativesly good and the gameplay offers some depth with a simple rule set. I especially like the intuitive line-of-sight -system and the way height differences work. Waiting for the expansions.

I tried this game once with a group of guys that have among them every single piece ever made for Hero Scape.  I wanted to like the game because these guys are just genuinely nice and likeable. But I did not like the game and I can not really say there is any one thing in particular that I did not like. When I saw the game at a Thrift Store for $5 I knew I could turn it for a quick profit.  Then I decided to hold on to it for a little while to give the game a few more tries.  Well, I still don't like it and I still can't say why so I sold it on Ebay for $80.

Played once. Very fun, light wargame. Great for those of us who *want* to like wargames, but don't. - The components are incredible. What you get for 39.99 puts things like Warhammer and the like to shame. You can't tell from the pics, but the hexes actually interlock as well, to keep the map from shifting and separating. There is not one single piece to paint or one single sticker to apply. The thing that takes longest to set up is creating the map, and that's quite fun!

From my kids' perspective, half the fun is just creating the board.  From my perspective, this is a throwback to those childhood days of mixing armies and seeing how would ninjas hold up against dinosaurs in a battle-royale for the ages.

Well, this game is for the ages. Heroscape is the epitome of eye candy when it comes to board gaming.  We've had many other family friends check out this game and get instantly hooked. Now they're the ones scouring the internet for more tiles and figures!  Long live Heroscape!

Un juego ya descatalogado que, considerado en el contexto adecuado, está francamente bien. Más allá de su espectacularidad visual -tablero modular que permite mil y una combinaciones y decenas de miniaturas pintadas de guerreros históricos y fantásticos- tiene unas mecánicas inteligentes que funcionan muy bien.

Los diseñadores han creado un juego de batallas fantásticas en el que prima el dinamismo y en el que las reglas jamás son un obstáculo, sino una útil herramienta. La clave o que hace diferente este juego y le da todo su potencial son las características particulares y las habilidades especiales de las miniaturas, y la forma en que interactúan unas con otras.

Si añadimos que los jugadores pueden reclutar libremente sus fuerzas -lo que es bastante divertido de por si-, que el juego admite hasta 4 jugadores (o 6 si se dispone de dos copias, tenemos un estupendo entretenimiento que difícilmente defraudará.

Dos últimas salvedades: que quede claro que el juego es lo que es, y no hay que buscar en él profundidad estratégica ni simulación elevada; no es ese su objetivo. Y por su propia idiosincrasia, el factor azar es muy elevado.

Went nuts and bought a huge amount of Heroscape in spring 2011. Three base sets owned plus the terrain from a fourth.

After a couple of plays I realised that the characters in the base set are all you need. The game is actually more fun when you have a tighter set of balanced characters that you're reasonably familiar with. So I sold off most of my other characters and focussed on getting more terrain.

Even though it cost me more money than I care to admit, I'm glad I invested. (It's become even more prohibitively expensive now!) It rarely leaves its box for now, but it will... one day it will...

--

Immensely satisfying. I spent two hours yesterday building a scenario with almost all my bits (super fun in itself), then another two hours just now playing an epic 2v2 game on it. The game was impressively dynamic, with the apparent advantage swinging back and forth several times, and the tension remaining high throughout. I'm upping my rating for this game.

--

I'm on a pattern of getting this out about annually, and it's always a hoot. Although, last time I got trounced because we played with the base set (plus a bunch of extra terrain) and I let my new-to-the-game opponent draft his entire army first. No way I can beat an army including Raelin, Syvarris, the paratroopers AND the marro warriors. I was left with vikings and shit.

It's always been the same with wargames and me. I buy enough minis for 2 armies, put everything together and try to get my friends to play. Even if they like it, I have to buy everything just to get someone to play. Heroscape solves this problem and delivers a better game experience. Even though it is non-collectable, it still takes quite a chunk of change to get every expansion. I highly recomend Heroscape to anyone that has the wargame blues.

I loved this game! Such a slug fest! Could get annoying at times with only 3 playing markers. And I did feel that elf, or range units in general, have the advantage in this game. That being said this game was so much fun! I think this would make an awesome video game! On an additional note, the only reason why I got rid of this game is I got caught up in buying the expansions way to much. Way to much. I still want that vampire expansion too. Anyways to addicting. I want to play lots of games! Not collect just one. That being said this game is great stand alone! Try it out!

This was a ton of fun when it came out but I just don't play it anymore.  Not sure exactly why, maybe it's just how long it takes to make the map, maybe it's the fact there is a ton of randomness involved.  I'm not sure.  I do likt it, buy only play it sporadically.

I'm not typically fond of toy-like games. But when Toys-R-Us was running their 2-for-1 sales on Hasbro games late in 2004, I picked up a couple copies, figuring that they were a good deal at $20 apiece and wouldn't be hard to unload if necessary. For months, those ugly, hulking boxes just sat on the shelf, exiled to my back room, and I was vaguely ashamed of owning them. 

Once I finally tried the darn game, I was a bit surprised to discover that it was actually a lot of fun! I've since collected almost all of the assorted junk that Hasbro has pushed my way, and despite occasionally suffering some buyer's remorse, I am still enjoying Heroscape.  I always appreciate games that are great fun for mixed groups of kids and adults. There are far too few of those games, and Heroscape is tough to beat in this category. It's not something I'd choose to play in my gaming group (for starters, it simply takes too long to construct and put away), but I'm very happy to have it around.

"Risk" like.  Odds in favour of attacking.  Hate the way only activated units can attack.  Units sit around like dummies and get trashed.

And I don't know why all the hype about the minis.  Ok components for the price, but these are really cheap looking minis.  I have seen so many nice looking painted lead figurines.  These figurines are a joke.  The components in Monsters Menace America are way better than these!

The modular terrain is neat looking (not great) but it feels cheap as well.

I'm intrigued that this did not go over as well as Duel of Ages. 

Sadly, the dice have seemed the deciding factor in my first few games. The losing player feels completely deflated, out of luck, and without hope. It can be a frustrating time. Luckily, the game is short and you can play again. Unluckily, it takes forever to set up and put away.

Also, I find it REALLY odd that you can give all 3 actions to the same character. This really puts an emphasis on Heroes. Why would you ever have cheap common units do anything but try to capture objectives?

My kids are finally old enough that we can play with the full rules. Games still sometimes devolve into dumping all the plastic on the table and smashing toys into each other, but while it lasts, I find there's just enough going on with initiative flops and piece synergies to give me some joy as a tactical wargame. The points system means I can short myself 50 or 100 points against the lads and have a challenging battle, too. My opinion of this game has improved greatly as a result.

Hasbro puts a price tag on the german edition like there were gold nuggets in the box. Thumbs down for greedy pricing. Rating after two games with master game rules. I like the freedom of choice to move your units where you want (in Memoir'44 you always need a suitable card). I like the fact that the defender is allowed to roll dice to defend himself (in Memoir'44 only the attacker rolls dice). I like the real 3D terrain (in Memoir'44 still all looks flat). No higher rating because dice rolling is random and randomness is the natural foe of tactics and strategy.

The last one I only got for the terrain, not the figures. Have many of the figure expansions. Happy with what I have. Collecting complete.

Fun. Good theme, the multi-era combat could be hyper-complex but this takes the opposite tack. Dice, enough that you can make the right decisions and still lose. That's ok with me but may bother some. Super-duper expandable and customizable.

We (my 9-year old son and I) are very disappointed in this game on many levels.  Game just lacks depth and fun.  

The length of play can be very short considering the investment in setup and rules complexity (if they are all used).  Balance between figures can be very lacking as everyone has a hero that basically is 10 more powerful than any of the other 5 figures they control.  So, most battles end up with one guys "hero" kicking the snot out of everyone else.  Game play and rules are simplistic, unrealistic and derivative.  This game just gets very old after a dozen games.  Even the terrain that EVERYONE starts out loving becomes brightly colored yet boring and repetitive as there are few rules regarding terrain.  The game itself can be pricey.  

Components are very nice with the figures actually being better than expected.

Our first 'proper' big-box game. Great with the kids (even my daughter sometimes plays). It has proved very inspirational for my son who enjoys making up new opponents from his toy figure collection. We even have a troop of Space Marines to battle with! True to other reports, it is impossible to get back in the box, so it has never been put away since we started playing it.

being able to get anyone to play is a big benefit, there is alot of strategy here in the drafting of units and the choice of who is moving each turn.  great design and great looking components.

RATING: 7.5
My son (8yrs) loves this game, but I am just so-so on it. I didn't think that I got annoyed by the luck of dice rolls, but I think that is what makes me not like this as much as my son. However, I love the 3D board, and the ability to build your own terrain and scenario. It's a great game for teaching my son about direct confrontation. The very first time we played the Marvel version of this game when he was 6, he cried after losing. But, now he takes it in stride. He knows that it's just a game, and he isn't going to win every time. And that is a great lesson to learn. For that I praise this game, and I will always play it with him.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Playable, but worth just for the miniatures and 3D terrain. Some creatures have very random and potentially unbalancing features. One, for example, rolls 9 dice for defense but has only 1 hit point, and another one may gain control of any opponent's creature through a succesful roll on a d20.

A simple, fun, great looking game.  Besides the toy factor, the game itself is a blast; beer and pretzels at it's best.  Plus, there is lots of room for tinkering.  There's already stats on the web for Star Wars characters, and I plan on using the terrain for my LOTR minis.  Worth the money.

You push around some plastic to build terrain, you push around some plastic to move dudes, and then you toss a lot of plastic to resolve combat. On occasion, I am very partial to pushing around plastic.

RATING: 6
After three plays.  I'm not a minis-wargame fan in any way, shape or form.  Having said that, I love HeroScape.  It's clearly targeting mainstream/younger crowds, but there's enough of a game for folks like me who have no time for Mage Knight, Warhammer, etc.  

The mechanics - movement, damage, combat, flying, unique characters as well as "squads" of three or four, special attacks that break the rules - are nuanced, deep, and steamlined enough to avoid the minute fiddly details that normally drive me away from meatier minis table-top gaming.  

I especially like the turn order mechanism: players are use four turn tokens numbered 1,2,3, and X.  Players place turn tokens on any characters/army cards they wish to move, and then will each move their 1's, 2's, and 3's after rolling for initiative.  The X is a bluff token each turn.  So when planning, one can consider who potentially will be moving on the other team, although when they will move that turn is unknown.  

This game gets you playing, and has lots of tension and tactics and replay.  For a MB game you get enormous value for your dollar - 30 detailed painted figures, and an innovative interlocking terrain system to design battlefields.  

My only gripe is that the box will barely hold the entire game (and will cease to if I buy expansions). Also a caution that the battlefield terrain setup each game takes at least 20 minutes minimum, so keep that in mind if you're playing with younger players. 

Great gateway to tabletop stuff, and the hobby surrounding it (painting, minis, etc).

I've played this game since 2006 and still love it. I've got at least 1 of every terrain set except Tundra (though I can borrow my brother in-law's when needed), multiple of each master set and nearly all the boosters. It's great fun and the kids love it. I've also enjoyed being part of C3G over at Heroscapers.com where we made (they still do) over 100 comic customs out of Heroclix minis. Well tested and balance new addition to the Heroscape maps and fun.

Damn you HeroScape! Damn you to hell for sucking thousands out of my bank account! LOL For a game that was originally aimed at 10 year old little boys it has taken over the hearts and minds of grown up white guys. Great synergy between all the different pieces. For the cost one of the best pre painted mini games out there.

I do love the components - ever anyone was able to put it back into it's original box? Anyways - it plays nice, it looks great - when I would be a kid, I would have freaked out I guess.
Maybe when the expansions allow pure squad only actions, it might show some more tactical value, but now it comes down to super-unique characters hounting down the weak squads.

RATING: N/A
Originally rated a 9, but the more I play the more I love it. Rapidly becoming my favorite game of all time. Only possible drawback is setup time, but I can make a quick map off the top of my head in only a couple minutes. And the setup time is a necessary evil for the flexibility allowed in the system. Easy to teach to everyone, and everyone I have taught has enjoyed it. Lots of dice rolling, yet the real strategy comes from army synergy and clever piece movement. Every time I read a comment about the luck in this game it makes me want to challenge the person to a game with one of the big tournament winners and explain why they lose 9 times out of 10. Infinitely replayable, truly never the same game twice. The permutations of maps and armies are uncountable. If you have to play only one game for the rest of your life, that game should be Heroscape.

7-3-08 Cory & Bo's(1st ) lose bad ( 420 pts, 2.5 hrs ) / 7-11 late night with Cory 1-1 ( forgot my roborats the 2nd game so I could have won? )

RATING: 6
My six year old girl enjoys this one too. She slaugthered me the first time we played, as she had the strongest army.

The second time she also wanted the strongest army again, but I changed the objective to simply capturing the enemy flag. So, while she was busy slaughtering me, I sneaked in and captured her flag.

Nice to leave already set up for games during the course of several days, but impossible for us, as we also have a three y. o.

  Light Ameritrash/theme game.

The greatest game of all time. I have my oldest son to thank for exposing me to it and starting my interest proper in board games. Looking through the TRU catalog, choosing something for Santa to bring him for Christmas, 2004, he stated, " I want this." I took a look at the image and description for Heroscape and replied, "So do [i]I![/i]"

Six days after receiving the master set, on New Years Day, 2005, my son's fifth birthday, he received a complete set of Mallidon's Prophecy. 

The rest is pure miniatures n' terrain building history, coupled with the best online fan community through three websites. Long live Heroscape.

Favorite Wave: Jandar's Oath for the variety of commons squads

Top 10 units in no particular order. but note I always enjoyed the high-movement units:
Cyprien Esenwein
Sir Dupuis
Isamu
Aubrien Archers
Marrden Hounds
Sujoah
Venoc Vipers
Zombies of Morindan
Shades of Bleakewoode
Me-Burq-Sa

Least favorite:
Major Q9
Deathreavers
Dund
Those elven Wizards, but Morsbane was always pretty cool

RATING: 9
Your inner 12-year-old will LOVE this.  It's just plain fun in a Vikings-killing-robots kind of way...

UPDATE:  I've raised my score on this one due to the number of whoopin' 'n hollerin' knock-down drag-out wars we've had.  The combat system is fast and simple, you don't have to paint the minis, and the terrain is fab.  No two games have ever been alike and the last one we played (a 500 points/side three-way slug-fest) ended with a single character with a single hit point left on the field.  Can't recommend this one enough!

This was great. I own several copies of this game and although I rarely play it as its intended but it makes for a wicked Battle-tech battlefield. This is gold for anyone who plays battletech  or Alpha Strike.

Picked up the Master Set heavily discounted in a rural toy shop (20 Euro: reduced from 60, and I had seen it there for sale at 60 for some time before I bought it...). Extremely flexible game system, great fun. Of course it triggered my collecting impulse and I now own pretty much all of the expansions (not all the flag bearers and none of the collectible convention-issued rares). I guess the total spend has WAY exceeded the feeble initial save. Ah well.

RATING: 9
Initial ranking after a few first games (8).  My sons loved it.  I think the rating will go up with more plays.  Great theme, no downtime, simple rules, a fair amount of luck to make the game slightly unpredictable and lots of FUN. 

One more note.  The customization aspect of this game is awesome.  If you have other miniatures, it is very easy to write your own army cards and invent custom rules.  

One of the advantages of Heroscape is that, you can customize it to fit your needs.  By capping the army limit, you control the game length.  By building your own map and choosing one of many scenarios, you make each game different.  

The possibilities are overwhelming considering such simple rules.

An important note.  This game is ADDICTIVE. If you like it, you will soon want to have all the expansions and figures.  Multiple sets are required to build impressive maps, otherwise you will feel a little disappointed by comparing your designs with the photos on Heroscapers. I am not yet at this point, as this hits your pocket hard, but I think that I will try to complete the collection and have at least one unit of each available.

With +70 games played, I have upgraded the ranking to 10, because the game deserves it.  In contrast to many eurogames, each game tells a story and you can actually remember battles even after several weeks.    

Remember: buy at least TWO from each COMMON SQUAD expansion pack.  Certain units simply play better when you have more figures and it is easier to control your army when you have fewer army cards on your side.

-1 for setup time.

I enjoy getting this game out and taking the time to set it up. I love the draft mechanic for putting your team together. However, the games often go too quickly to really develop much. The battlegrounds are huge, but most of it goes unused. Can't help but feel like I'm playing a game for children.

This could be the game that launches miniature gaming into the mainstream, with simple but engaging play (I found myself oddly into a game for ages 8 ), and the 3D terrain is just fabolous. 
The painting is both excellent and consistent, for people that are trying to get into casual miniatures gaming (like myself), Heroscape is really good if you don't mind the somewhat randomized setting (patriots fighting werewolves, wtf?!). I only have the base set right now, but am looking forward to getting the expansions.

RATING: 7
Love the two phases of this game.  1 -- the setting up is a blast.  I have 6 sets and have built some very cool maps.  2 -- the gameplay is simple and the depth of characters very good.  The system continues to expand and has been very well thought out and handled.  I'm compelled to use every terrain piece when I build a map, so setup time has gotten very lengthy.  I will need to find a permanent place to set it up and just change out occasionally.  I'm giving it a 9, although gameplay for me is about a 7.  But, the components, variety, quality, replayability, and overall coolness factor puts it high in my regard.

This is an awesome game, its simple to learn and teach. It has a simple yet fun mechanic, creating your team through the point based system is great and decently balanced, consider this the poor man's table top game (the likes of Warhammer and Iron Kingdom). Building your stage can also be as fun as playing on it, because being able to have custom maps is one of the best features of this game. Unlike most board games, this one has expansions similiar to (TCG) trading card games, adding to the already huge pool of characters to play from every year. Another great feature is the marker system, it is a very creative way of taking turns and actions, as you can set a simple unit to act multiple times, or spread them out, there is also a decoy marker which adds to the deception. Overall a great game to have.

It has been a while since I played this game, but there once was a time that it was an absolute favorite in our group. Building a grand terrain + matching scenario was always an important part of the game. It's a nice light-weight table top fantasy game. Simple rules, modular board set-up and ample expansions give it sufficient replay value.

Mi juego ideal de escaramuzas: sencillo, con poderes variables, escalable y ¡con metajuego! Para personas sin tiempo para pintar o aprender tochos de reglas. Satisface mis expectativas de jugón (suficientes posibilidades estratégicas), de padre (disfruto jugándolo con mis hijos) y del niño que llevo dentro (¿a quién no le gusta un juego con samurais, ninjas, vaqueros, robots, zombies, elfos, dragones, aliens, comandos...?) Más táctico de lo que parece (por los glifos, la altura, el terreno y la construcción del ejército). Buenísima mecánica la de la línea de visión (sin dudas en un 99% de las ocasiones) PROS: Los héroes parecen héroes (son más fuertes). Poderes especiales chulísimos (hacen distintos cada ejército gracias a sus sinergias). Terreno en 3D. Más barato que otros juegos de miniaturas. CONS: Hay dados y suerte. Si el terreno es grande, se dedica mucho tiempo en el setup. Tortura para completistas. Descatalogado.

Reglas caseras que podrían usarse:

Cambiar tirar 2 dados de ataque por una calavera; 3 dados de defensa por un escudo; 6 dados de valkiria por un éxito con el estarndarte.

Probar a eliminar el bonificador de altura superior en el ataque a distancia

Subo su nota de 7.5 a 8.2 tras mi primera partida con mis hijos.

[ENG]

My favourite skirmish´s game: straightforward, variable powers, it scales very well and with metagame! Ideal for people without time to paint miniatures or to learn a big book of rules. It covers my expectations of gamer (enough choices and strategies), of father (I love playing it with my sons) and my childhood expectations too! (who doesn´t love a game with zombies, androids, ninjas, dragons, cowboys, elves, orcs, samurais, aliens, soldiers...?). It´s more tactic than it seems (becouse of the glyphs, terrain altitudes, armies´ construction...). Really good idea the LOS (without doubts in 99%).

RATING: 10
This game is pretty jaw dropping with tasty, creamy bits and a decent out-of-box game with plenty of room for mods and house rules, though not totally necessary.  I actually have two of these "master" sets and lots of expansions.  This is the game that thrust me back into my boardgaming geekdom as I just couldn't ignore its striking beauty in a display case.  Now that's what I call effective marketing.  Too bad it takes so damn long to set up and disassemble (It really needs its own dedicated table).

R.I.P heroscape.net


Update:  I've decided once I have a dedicated table for this game, all drawbacks and pitfalls will have been eliminated, and thus its ten rating is granted.  Just wanted to add that as my love for this game just doesn't show enough.

Re-Update: Oh who am I kidding? I just can't think of any more excuses not to champion this absolutely gorgeous little sucker - even if I throw tantrums occasionally due to statistically impossible dice rolls (F-n' luck!).

RATING: 6.5
Apr08: I've only got one short match it, but it was pretty darn fun.  There's definitely a manageable number of exceptions to this very light wargame.  Personally, I love the LOS rules to this one: Can your shooter's head see the target's body at all?  If so, then you have LOS.

I wish there were more objective style scenarios.  Maybe someone will make a larger campaign for this set.  Maybe set it the Halo universe?

If you at all like light wargames with pretty bits, this is up your alley.

If you want a little deeper strategy, Nexus Ops is a better bet.

(I own both master sets and nothing else.)

A fun-and-quick tactical wargame game with fantastic components.  It also has a very high "cheese" factor -- you can have men-in-black and dinosaurs fighting mechs and Vikings... how cool is that!  Like most tactical wargames, this game suffers from the luck of the dice.  Recommended for both casual wargamers and for 3rd edition D&D players that use the hex-based combat rules from Unearthed Arcana.  It's the only game that I have three of.

This game turned out to be more fun than I originally expected.  I purchased it for 18$ (see my earlier journal entry) and figured I could easily recoup my money if I didn't like it.  My wife and I skipped the basic game and went straight into an advanced conflict (as it is rather basic anyway).   While the dice add randomness, the luck factor is not as high as I feared it would be before playing.  Strategy in drafting a team and tactics during the game are usually the deciding factors, NOT the dice.  Playing with a draft adds some strategy to the game.  However, this game is often too long considering its lack of depth.  I'm sure it would be a blast if I could find other gamers who really liked it to play it, but my wife is only lukewarm in regards to the game.

The "fun" and "cool" factors are very high for this game.  Basically a lazy man's miniatures game, it reminds me of BattleTech, which I played alot back in the 80s.  But HeroScape looks fantastic, with beautiful pre-painted plastic figures and an ingenious modular board design that makes setting up complex terrain in 3D a snap(literally!).  The basic set is a great bargain; I've accumulated 5 sets so far (you can combine sets to make even cooler maps).  The very simple rules are just right for the tone, which is more visual than cerebral.  Diceophobics need not apply.

One of our favorite games; good mix of strategy and "luck". Setup and tear-down can take a little time, and if it wasn't for this I would have given it a 10. Of course, setup time varies according to how many "expansions" you have (extra map pieces to use, and characters to choose from). Altogether though, it's a great game; too bad it was discontinued :(

Good dice fest with alot of replay value as you can make up lots of different boards with the terrain provided.Fun to draft your army.Also scales well with the basic rules for younger players.The advanced rules will help the more hardcore gamers enjoy the game as well.One downside is even though it is so fun to build your own maps with the terrain it can take a real long time, sometimes longer than the game ends up lasting!

Decent minis, great design for the terrain. Wish it was still in print. Gameplay is fun, but it takes longer to set up than to play.

RATING: 8
Fun game. So far as complexity, it's a step up from HeroQuest and a step down from miniatures; a nice middle ground between the two. The different possible combinations of heros/villains/troops/etc. is very exciting and I love the expansions. I've limited myself to just two base sets but I've put a lot of work into upgrading and customizing them. For example, I've flocked all the tiles, and built custom scenery such as trees, rocks clusters, and a beautiful plaster temple courtyard. 

Includes Mimring, Grimnak, Izumi, Vikings, Agents, Marro Warriors, Sgt.Drake, DW 9000, Zettian, Raelin, Syvarris, Airborne, Ne-Gok-Sa.

Wheee!  Little toy soldiers!  This game brings out the kid in everyone.  It's a blast to play with any age group.  A very nice feature is that the board can be made in any shape or size for different length games.  Another nice feature is the ruleset that scales in difficulty to accomodate older and/or more experienced players.  A real hoot, and I don't use the phrase "a real hoot" lightly.  For forty bucks, the quality of the game components is absolutely astonishing.  Good bang for the buck...nay, EXCELLENT bang for the buck.  The expansions keep making it better and better....Herocrack.

The master set comes with everything you need to get started. Lots of figures, terrain and even some ruins. The figures come painted already as well so you don't have to mess around with that nonsense either.

There are tons of expansions to buy and can give you a ton of options when deciding what army you want to play. In addition there are special terrain expansions as well to help reduce the effectiveness of range. (Jungle, Glaciers, Road/Forest).

There is a luck element however most games are won by smart tactical decisions and careful order marker placement rather then lucky die rolls. To prove this point even further the same player has won both Indy GenCon Championships for 2006/2008. I myself have won both the 2007/2009 GenCon Championships. Are we just lucky or good? I'd say a little bit of both. It just really hammers down the point though that more often then not the player that is a better tactician has the advantage. 

I rated this a 10 simply for the significant impact this game has had on me. It was a huge gateway game into board gaming for me. In addition I have loved the many different ways I have played this game. The tournament scene, huge team battles, or simply big free for all battles are all a lot of fun. This game has gotten the most replay value out of all games I currently own and I can see myself playing this 5-10 years down the road.

Initial Rating: 8.5 (September 2010)

I love miniatures and this game has tons and tons of them. Sadly I have played it only once, but it was great.

The components are the main factor here, they are absolutely stunning, the miniatures very detailed, the terrain very well done and you can create any map you want adding to the replayability factor.

This is a fairly shallow tactical game although I confess we played with the basic rules. It has a reasonable amount of luck (but you can mitigate that playing with the probabilities). The game is great for children and the fun factor is through the roof.

My only dislike is having to pack all the bits again after a play, it is a pain.

Love to see there are a lot of expansions.

This game was once in my top 10 list of favorite games.

It’s been years since I last played Heroscape Master Set: Rise of the Valkyrie and my gaming tastes have changed a lot these years. I no longer enjoy most Ameritrash games, I´m decidedly an Euro player now so my desire to play again Heroscape is rather low. 

Also, I no longer associate great miniatures with great games. CMON cured me of that malady.

I HATE to build the world in which we are going to fight, sometimes, it takes more than the playing part. The teardown is also a pain.

You don´t need much brain power to play it, that is, is it a game light on meaningful decisions. Perhaps with the expansions it gets better.

I got rid of my copy and I don’t think I will ever play Heroscape again, but I concede it is a great game for children.

A great chance to play a relatively light wargame. It's accessible and entertaining. It has the tactical joy of moving pieces around terrain without the expensive process of producing your own terrain. There is, perhaps, a little stigma about it being juvenile so if that's a concern then keep it in mind.

Heroscape Maste Set and 2 Fortress Archkyrie sets are combined into one big set available for trade.Nope, I don't wish to separate them out. Make me an offer anyway. Be creative!

RATING: 6.5
Still unsure about holding on to this, but the bits are sooooo damn cool.

The setting seems so close to Duel of Ages (a bit simpler though) that it makes me hedge and debate taking Heroscape back. Then I see the bits again, I get light headed, lost in the sparkling lights, and will breaks under the enchantment of the cool little figures.

I enjoy Duel of ages (I bought the whole set) and it's got a lot of replay with out any needed scenarios...yet, so does Heroscape apparently.

I'm more than sure, that I'll end up with both and I'll end up with all the figures for heroscape.

Wow, it's been over 10 years since I first saw Heroscape at GenCon and purchased it immediately. An amazing amount of plastic was crammed into the box, and almost impossible to put back in.

Great game with lots of variety and potential for strategy and tactics -- especially with all the terrain expansions.  Eliminates most or all of the issues that can occur in miniatures games with all the dice-chucking fun.  It's an investment to set up the maps and draft units, but well worth it.

Heavy on the luck factor, with dice determining quite a bit at the expense of strategy and tactics, this is still a fun lighter game.  "Warhammer for Dummies."  But without the 100  hours of painting, the $400   in purchases and the 5  hours in play time.  Clocking in at 40 minutes for a shorter scenario, actually setting up and taking down the game took more time.

RATING: 7
 Bought 2 copies right away just to get lot's of terrain and figs. Well worth the $40 for everything in this set. I rate it a 10 for the painted figs, A 10 for the unique terrain, A 7 for game play, A 9 on the fun factor and a 4 on strategy for an overall 7. This is the best gameboard ever designed! Miniature terrain at conventions in this quality would cost you more than 5 of these games so get a couple of sets. Can hardly wait for expansion miniatures and scenarios. I'm already melding my LoTR collectable miniatures into the framework of this game to finally get some play out of them. Sold the ENTIRE collection for $110. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Another overpriced, overhyped, tabletop battle game.  Cheap looking prepainted plastic miniatures give the game a little flavour, but not enough to get me to ever play it again.  The mix of genres might work OK in a role-playing game like GURPS or Torg, but it's totally wasted here.

I think that I'm being generous in giving this game a 5 rating.  I should mention though, that it has been very well received by other members of our club and is played regularly at our Games Days.

Verry good value for money game. The modular board is just great, why didn't someone else think about that before???? You can combine it with a verry large range of games.

Although I live in Europe and the game hasn't been released here, I still bought it from the store here on boardgamegeek. High shipping costs, but the games woth it!

Bought this (x2 sets) in '04 for my son's birthday and was pleasantly surprised.  A very nice effort from Hasbro.  Picked up the first 4 expansion sets of Mallidon's Prophecy to add more variety and will pick-up additional expansions for my son as they become available.

At least 3 times a year this game spends quite a bit of time spread out in various scenario forms on our dining room table (which expands to seat 8).

UPDATE:  My rating has increased 'twice' due to the recent improvements made by expansions and various landscape terrains & structures that are now available.  (My son, however, would rate this game an 11)

A definite keeper for my son's collection.

An apparent simplification of the old Avalon Hill counter games, with different pieces having different attack and defence capabilities, and both sides having different objectives.

I admit to being torn on how to score this one. The game mechanics are pedestrian, for the most part, but the way the whole package is produced and put together is remarkable. Stealing from Duel of Ages to pit multiple periods and genres against each other is excellent. The terrain tiles, how they are constructed and conceived and are ever-expandable, clearly deserves a "10" rating. Ultimately, I think while combat is lacking enough to keep this from being perfect, but the game is JUST ABOUT perfect for its target audience. This game will be remembered and sought out for a VERY long time. It's a landmark of production, in a way. I'm not the target, but my son is. I can attest that this game meets the designers' goals and then some.

Es un juego que estéticamente te deslumbra cuando lo ves en fotos. Trae un montón de material, muchas losetas de plástico para montar distintos escenarios y todas esas figuritas pintadas.

A la hora de jugarlo es otra historia. Se tarda más en montarlo que en acabar una partida, un par de malas tiradas de dados y se acabó.

Supongo que para la gente que le guste mucho este juego, tendrá un montón de estrategias ocultas, pero yo no se las vi por ningún sitio.

I did like this game. It brought me back from a long hiatus from gaming. But I could never get anyone to play it and toting around all the peaces was nuts. I was hoping that they would develop the historical stuff a bit more and I could ignore the fantasy and sci-fi stuff. And I had lots of multiples of just about everything. But once they took the plunge into full scale D&D, I jumped ship. Sold everything. Got a good price. Haven't looked back. Haven't regretted it.

This game is so much fun.  The rules are basic and easy to catch on to, but the depth of strategy is near limitless with the vast and varried units as well as the ease of customization.

Plenty of opportunities for maneuver (thanks to the glyphs and jockeying for a height advantage) combine with a good clean system that encourages difficult choices (due to the limited # of orders you can issue a turn and the ability to issue a single unit multiple orders).

RATING: 5
Heroscape has actually taken a pretty precipitous drop rating-wise since I originally played it.  Early on I would have given it perhaps a 9, based on balance, quality of pieces, ease of play.  However, several factors have conspired to drop it to a 6:

1. In a strange sort of catch-22, the more pieces that become available for this game, the more time-consuming and complicated it gets.  What patience and novelty won early on in terms of map setup and drafting (easily consuming half an hour before you can even begin play) is now pretty much gone.  I can barely even stand to think of playing this anymore as a result.  

2. My patience for games heavily to completely dependent on dice rolls has waned significantly.  

In other words, after spending hours and hours just drafting and building maps alone, Heroscape has moved from a game I used to be semi-fanatical about to a game I'm so unenthused about that all my stuff takes up the same spot on my shelf that it did almost a year ago now. 

4-14-06:  Played a couple games of this over last weekend.  One of them was a 3 on 1, with me the lone defender, adn we had a great game going until the attackers (all three) had a stretch of completely amazing dice rolls (19 out of 20 skulls over a number of rolls) and this completely gutted me.  My dislike for dice mechanics is growing exponentially, so I'm dropping this to a 5.

Have 2x of RotV

Heroscape is the acme of plasticrack. While others have been content merely to create collectible or semi-collectible figures, Heroscape decided to up the ante by throwing in sets of attractive, highly customizable plastic terrain for the figures (and your imagination) to play on. Of course, neither of those things would mean much without solid gameplay, which Heroscape has. A minimalist but thoroughly adequate and satisfying rules system, a nearly endless set of possible map and army combinations, and an enthusiastically supportive community help round out the "package." The only major cons, really, are the relative scarcity of some of the sets (a problem that no doubt will become harder as still more new ones are produced) and the fairly high cost point if you're like me (and I know you are) and have that completist itch. I suppose you could also complain about the longish setup time, but that can be mediated by choosing smaller maps (which often times are just as satisfying as the huge ones).

Very heavy on the toy factor. It's not a great game but it's not bad either. It's more fun just playing the base game, once you start throwing in the 20 or more expansions the game can be a chore. You have to look through hundreds of cards and then figure out what units work best together and put together a decent army. Some of the new expansions also have some units that are extremely hard to take down. Not yanking on it, it is waht it is and i, like every body else am a sucker for the figures. The sculpts are awesome, ditto the paint jobs. It's a fun shoot'em up but not much more.

The system this game runs on is very simple and easy to grasp. The rule book included an even simpler rule-set, if I recall correctly. There was never any reason to implement that. 

Setup: (1)
:'( I hate setting this game up. I mean, I LOVE having the game set up, I love all that can be done, but I hate actually having to do it.

Area required to play: (1)
This game is going to take up a lot of space. Usually we, and I find many others, play it on the floor.
 
Fun: (10)
This is one of the very most fun games I have ever played! This thing is/was/will always be one of the best things in the world of board gaming.

Theme Integration / Mechanics: (10)
The theme of this thing spilled out of boxes and left puddles in the aisles of Wal-Mart. That's the reason the game was cancelled; big box stores kept suing the company that manufactured it. The mechanics also work well to keep the game moving very quickly while making each unit feel and play differently.

Replay Value: (10)
This game is as re-playable as Magic. With all the different units that were available, and all the customization that a person could add to the game should they so desire, I can't see that I'll ever become board of this game.

Storage: (1)
There's nothing to do except to get some BIG boxes and throw everything you have inside.

Accessibility: (10)
The game really is easy enough to teach to children and the components (especially those minis) make it very appealing to most audiences.

Over-All/Bonuses/Biases:(+10) I really, really love this game. Yes, it's crazy expensive now that it's out of print. Yes, it takes up way too much room. Yes, it's a bastard to set up and take down. I wouldn't actually suggest anyone buy into this game because of the cost, but I do hope (and hope that you hope) that it'll someday come back in to print. Also, if you ever find that you have the chance to play it? PLAY IT!

Technically my 9 year old son owns this game, but what the hey.  Master set is solid, rules are pretty tight and in the 3 games I've played this past week the tension has been palpable... even against my 9 year old.  Hope it can hang with this rating... my worry is the collectible figure aspect of the game will take over and lead to more and more $$ with little added to the game.  I think they need to keep the figures in check and emphasize the terrain.  As all good gamers know... terrain is where tactics begin.

THIS IS NOT A NORMAL MASTER SET.

I have terrain, figures and other bits that comprise somewhere between 150% and 200% of a Heroscape Master Set: Rise of the Valkyrie. This is an odd assortment from a Craigslist purchase a few years ago. (One of those "I'm not sure what I have, but it's a big box." kind of deals.)

It's a tough thing to set a value, but if you're interested, let's talk and work a deal.

If you're looking to get into Heroscape, you're looking at nearly 2 complete sets of basic figures and around 50% more terrain than a master set. Anyway, details are below.

=======================================
X of Y = I have X, and Y was what comes in a standard set.

I am very hooked on this game...

The basic mechanics are simple and straightforward, making it basically a simple and light miniature wargame, without the many hazzles of "true" tabletop games! The only thing that can´t be counted or meassured is LOS, which should be fairly obvious 99% of the time anyways... The many different squads and heroes, with their myriad special powers makes for endless combinations. Trying to build the perfect army to beat your opponent, and take advantage of the map is fun in itself. The miniatures are very cool and over time some of them really grow on you, and take on a life of their own!

UPDATE: A few years on, I have to admit that I just LOVE Heroscape and everything about it! One of my absolute favourite games. And I have a complete collection! Funny thing is that when it came out, I wrote it off as a childrens game, and only bought it, when I found it cheap on sale, with the intent of using it at the after school club for kids where I work... Things kind of took off after that! I now have a complete collection, complete being at least one of everything ever made for Heroscape, several of some. 
I am the founder, and proud member of [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/347216] the League of Extraordinary Heroscapers[/url], a BGG society for middleaged, and older, men (and 2 women) who still get all giddy playing war with their toy soldiers!

UPDATE: 5 years in, and I still absolutely love Heroscape! Original, Super Heroes or the D&D stuff, it´s all good!

RATING: 7.5
A surprisingly good game about anachronistic monster bashing. I was expecting nothing more than a simple roll-and-hit game, but there's quite a bit of planning and strategy to be had (advanced rules with glyphs).

Components were amazing (modular board makes for amazing scenarios) and fairly well-painted minis. I would've liked some terrain rules (all terrains are the same), but overall, the set is extremely good value for money.

A fun middle-weight game that can be scaled to a player's taste.

the characters are pretty random and generic but albeit kind of interesting. the only problem is this game cause a huge fight within our group...from the making the map to crap about dice rolling off the table.As it was starting to get boring(you do the same thing again and again) one of my friends buttons was pushed and he threw it off the table. classic moment and its safe to say its never hitting the table again haha.

Nice and Light - Fun, Good Bits, A bit long on the set up but definately enjoyable! Looking trade for a 1st edition Master set. I think one of the major things I like about this game is the real sense of Victory or Defeat. Something to savor or something something to learn from. Euros don't give you that kind of satisfaction. Sure, when you win you go yeah!!!! for about 5 seconds (if that), then on to the next game. They almost feel hollow. Interesting to have finally discovered the difference between Euro and AT after a year of playing...

I have played this several times now. I downgraded my rating from a 10 to a 7. Although it's fun and I like the game overall, it takes way too long to set it up for the level of fun it delivers in return. Now I wish they would have just made it with a regular board or mat with terrain tiles instead of all those crazy interlocking hexes.This game is better suited for a kid who has lots of spare time on his hands for building and constructing that insane hex map. Because of this, I may not be bringing this game out as often as I had hoped.

RATING: 8
Lots of toys, and I love pre-painted miniatures.  The rules are simple enough to rope interested folks in easily, but leave enough room to create strategies (albeit light ones).  Obviously designed for the pre-teen audience, but is designed very well (a good game, is a good game).  The simple rules seem to be begging for additional house rules as the group outgrows the simplicity and starts to want something more (like flow in water and resulting movement), but play fine without them.

This is definitely the best of the Master Sets as it captures the battle across time very well with the variety of armies it comes with.

Heroscape would be my favorite game of all time - if it wasn't so difficult to play it! It's not a difficult game as far as mechanics or time - those both essentially scale to the degree the players would like - but because the board(s) are behemothly sized and could take up multiple tables if allowed. It remains my favorite light tactical wargame - and it sits at the table of my favorite games, ever, because it's cheap (for what it is ... until one buys 10 copies, that is), varied, beautiful, easy to learn, and quick.

RATING: 9
This game requires a lot of terrain to be fun, i.e. with a lot of highs and lows in the map.  I'll let others collect these and just play when I get the chance.  It's a cool game for a trashy evening, that's for sure.  *Edit* So I've thrifted a set of the RotV terrain and a friend gave me one of the sets of minis (he has 9 copies of the game), so now I have a set and am considering buying Swarm of the Marro to augment my terrain and minis choices.  
**Edit** So now I have a huge tub of Heroscape, a lot of thrifted sets and some homemade terrain bits.  You could say I like the game a lot, I guess.

The base set was actually a good start with a reasonable number of figures, unlike the Marvel base set, for example. Game is a serious pain to set up and take down, but somehow it is way more fun than a dicefest has a right to be. Keep me away, as I really don't need this kind of money-sink.

The game components get a 10 and it can be a lot of fun to build landscapes Lego style.  As an actual game though it's completely terrible.  I owned nearly everything for this game and did have fun in that same way you can with legos but there are just so many better systems out there for gameplay these days I just couldn't play this one again no matter how ingenious the 3D board setup was.  Once they added D&D minis it became even more obvious as there are many very good games that utilize fantasy miniatures supurbly (at varying game weight levels).  Lastly there is simply the reality of the value staring back at me.  $1000.00 At least I got just for selling it all.  Even with our son it was mostly a toy when he was younger and by the time he could play properly the preference was to play with this one as a toy and pick something else to play as a game.

The game that decides whether or not vikings are on the same level as a samurai or a roman. So many different factions, abilities, and fun in this dice-chucking tactical miniatures game. This is probably the pinnacle for this genre of games, as the game is just so elegant and easy to teach, and it looks so cool once it's set-up. So much fun discovering all of the different combos that can be had. Sad I missed out on this when it first came out, as getting a copy now would be rather expensive.

Cuando abres esa caja y ves todas esas minis pintadas(sobre todo los que hemos jugado a Warhammer), todo ese terreno en 3D, las ruinas, el dragón, el impresionante Grimnak... no puedes creerte que no te haya costado el doble.

Puedes gastarte una pasta en expansiones, pero este set tiene mucha vidilla.

Although my g/f never wants to play games with me, when I was unpacking this one, she went "omg what is that??" and immediately wanted to play. Turns out she loves it, and now she wants to play all the time. For my part, I used to love FF Tactics, Vandal Hearts, Phantom Brave, and all those tactical RPG video games - and Heroscape is a board game version! Finally I can play real people instead of an AI.
Bloody awesome game. Very accessible to non-gamers, I've found.
Room for lots of creativity too in building and scenarios.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Couldn't really get into it.  The set-up time with the building of the board and the general "toy-like" feel of the thing (like the fact that the box was a piece of junk) meant that it never could get taken seriously.

Traded it away for Samurai Swords (still on the Ameritrash vein, but more to my taste).

RATING: 6.5
Rating after two plays of the beginners game.

Setup takes a long time. Longer than the actual game. Not much strategy in basic game. Is probably fun playing with kids.

I need to try out the advanced game. I hope that is more challenging. At the moment it is a disappointment when played by two adults.

It doesn't help that my opponent is not a big fan of those types of games. He hated claustrophobia which I enjoy a lot.

When i bought Heroscape I read the rules and thought about a simple miniature game.Then a friend of mine said that his english rules where different,in my italian rules there is only a way to do armies and units cannot be duplicated,but the english original rules where different and they allow to do armies...I never tried it too hard,after all is too expensive(but not too much for a miniature game)

Lots of expansions too.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
My rating is for all of the expansions and the base game together. Quick and simple game play makes for several games in an evening. Heavy thinkers may not enjoy it and the set up could get tedious but overall one of the best eye-candy games with high 'sheer-fun' value. Not sold on the mixed genres yet. As the new expansions start coming out I'm more and more attracted to it. Combos that line up with races (rewarding players to keep within theme) and terrain dependent movement have brought the game closer to a think before you act style of play rather than just move and shoot.

Hmm.  Nice enough bits, and OK super-light minis game, but there are a lot of things I like better about Shock Force: reserve fire; rules for designing your own weapons & units (that's fun!); general-purpose rules instead of unit-specific "here are the rules for Mimring's special attack"; the way command radius & morale is handled; cover; much faster setup.

Things I like better about HeroScape than Shock Force: glyphs (they add interest); the scenarios.

Not bad for being a simple dice combat game.  There isn't much strategy being that the dice control who wins, but the variety of units is nice and its relatively simple to learn to play.  - I am embarrassed to tell people I play this, it really does seem like a kids toy.  Every time I play though, I feel the urge to buy more units.

I own three sets.  This game is great.  Unfortunately it doesn't get played much because you have to pick and build a scenario, then draft an army, then play, and often with my gaming crowd people would rather just grab a game and go.  But still a great game!

This has to be one of the most entertaining games out there.  It is simple, easy to show non-gamers how to play.  Its a good change of pace from normal German games.  Easy enough for kids, but its all adults buying it anyways.  I hope this game is well supported, as expansions would put this game well over the top as one of the best games of all time.  The terrain pieces are conceivably the most immaculate out of any 'original game box'.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.7
I have had this game for one year now and I thouroughly enjoy it.  It has the random factor of rolling the dice, but I enjoy that in a game.  In my mind Heroscape is what Battle Chess should have been.  You have a given movement for each character.  Line of sight and relative elevation make a difference.  I also love all of the special abilities of all of the characters.  Between the large variety of characters and the modular board I have never played a game that was the same.  

One of the few things I didn't like was the way the turns are organized for the rounds.  The way it is set up Grimak could take three turns in a row while your samuri sit back and pick their nose.  I altered this rule so in each round every character gets one turn.  This has enabled epic battles with very large armies.  It also aliviates the problem of on person picking a couple of very expensive characters and another person picking a several less expensive characters and not being able to gang up on the larger more expensive characters.  

All in all its a great game that is simple enough for 10 year old to grasp but complex enough to keep an adult interested.

One last thing I really have enjoyed is seeing all of the creative custom characters people have made.

Simply Brilliant, the best tactical game I have ever played. The rules are simple and the board is made of hex. So you don't need rulers for movement.  It makes the game much more transportable compared to other games. The price is also cheaper than other miniature games. Finaly, since the theme can be anything, you can easily import miniatures from any other game.

Light, fun, dice-rolling game with very nice miniatures.  There are usually some interesting tactical decisions to be made (especially at the beginning of the game when one has a lot of units) and drafting one's army offers some room for strategic analysis of how to diversify one's forces and adapt a group for a certain scenario.

RATING: N/A

All in all, I have the majority of the components, but some things are missing since there are a ton of game components in this box. I have 22 out of the 30 painted figures, ALL of the dice, ALL of the regular terrain hex tiles, 18 out of the 21 water hex tiles, both ruins landscape pieces, 7 out of the 10 glyphs, ALL 24 wound markers + grenade marker + round marker.

Here's the rundown of what's missing: 
-- Missing 8 painted figures (out of 30): 1 Airborne Elite guy, both Zettia Guards, Mimring dragon body (although I do have both wings), Thorgrim the Viking Champion, Raelin the Kyrie Warrior, 1 Izumi Samurai guy, and 1 Tarn Viking Warrior.
-- missing 3 water tiles (out of 21)
-- Missing Izumi Samurai card, but have the other 14 cards (though a few are bent/damaged)
-- missing 3 glyph tiles (out of 10)
-- missing all 16 order markers

RATING: 7
This is a fun miniature-based dice-fest romp.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
What I like:
- Some games can be epic (like a 4-player scenario that was so balanced that it all came down to a few, climatic dice rolls).
- Many scenarios, with many different flavors.
- Nice special powers.  The various cards really have a different feel.
- The fact that special powers are on cards makes them more "real" than the powers printed in tiny icons on the base of LotR: Combat Hex minis.
- Heroes really feel like heroes: their strong.
- Faster combats than in LotR: Combat Hex (fewer dice).
- Nice miniatures, with various sizes: nice variety.
- Simple and fluid system, with interesting tactical possibilities.
- Interesting tactical choices, thanks to the card ordering system; the stacking of markers is also interesting.
- The 3D terrain is much richer in tactical terms than a map.  The visual and tactile aspect of various heights is a plus.
- The visual aspect allows one to really see a kind of movie unfold; this "story" aspect makes games more memorable.
- Nice support (FAQ).
- How to play well is not so obvious: the army must be chosen well, the threats correctly assessed, and it is not so easy to find enough time to think about a sound strategy with some many actions taking place everywhere on the board (which tend to bring the focus to tactical issues).

What I do not care for:
- A little long, for the depth (compare Race for the Galaxy!) or the tenseness (compare Space Hulk).
- Setup a little long (10'?).
- More chaotic than Lotr: Combat Hex, because a single mini can move three times in a single turn, and because you plan 3 actions without knowing what your opponent will do.
- The terrain does not look really good.

Overall conclusion:
- Better miniature game than LotR: Combat Hex, except for the setup time.  More flavor (creature cards, visual appeal, varied figures), fewer dice, more tactical possibilities (3D terrain, ordering of orders).
- Not as tense as Space Hulk, which is currently my favorite miniatures game.

Well of course it's hefty and gorgeous and you can often get it and parts for it at nice discounts. The game itself is fun, and unlike many miniatures games I actually can sometimes come close to winning, but the long long setup time means I just don't often pull this out. I don't find it compelling enough to sit down and muck about with all the pieces. Maybe if I had a game room with a table where I'd keep it set up all the time it'd get more play, but for now it's easier not to play it than to play it.

The best introductory wargame on the market to teach to kids.  I love the way the rules (streamlined) have removed all those cheesy little things you hear arguments about in GW games, Warzone, and the other wargames.  It's a little simplistic, but then the draft and setup against players of your level becomes a very important factor.

Got this in a trade, it is more awesome than I remembered. It has tons and tons of terrain and  lots of cool figures. The first time I cracked it open with some friends, we playet it 5 times in a row, one after another, 2 normal, 3 with Marvel expansion. It's fun and engaging, it became, in a night, a staple to my main gaming group. Now I need expansions... EXPANSIONS... EXPAAAANSIOOOOONNNNS!!!

Edit: It has become evident that this game needs expansions to survive, or at least with my group. I told you they stick with what they like... well... my friends stick to the exact same army every time we play, talk about "sucking the fun out of a game"!

Edit: I now have 3 master sets and the maps get bigger and bigger, but still I find it too long, it's fulfilling, but I somehow feel empty every time I play it, I think it's because I play it mostly with a lot of people (groups of 5-6) so waiting literally hours when you get kicked out early, it's not fun at all...

Bought at a highly discounted price from Argos in the UK so I feel I have got incredible value but I might of felt differently if I had to of paid full price.  I might of wanted more terrain, greater variety of scenarios, more unique heros etc

Guilty pleasure.  I must admit the set-up is a big part of the fun, the last man standing scenarios rock, the minitures look good and the drafting is a cool but neccessary touch.  A simple guilty pleasure.

The look my girlfriend gives me when she sees me playing this is hard to describe - I think she would prefer to catch me wearing lingerie.  Oh well, too busy to worry . . . I've got to capture the ruins with my squad and I only have 1 life left

A light tactical miniature game.  The minis are painted and have a wide group of "armies" ranging from Viking heros to a guy on a T-Rex.  You organize your tools on plastic terrain and fight it out against you opponent.  Each army has a special ability and it is fun quick game.  

Setup of the plastic pieces on the map can take a while.

The one big hit against this game is the that the plastic water tiles are extremely fragile and are easily broken.  

A solid game though especially good for kids.

Of all the Miniature war games I've tried Heroscape will always be my favourite.

The pre-painted minis that ranged from Futuristic Sentient Robots to Norse themed Valkyrie.

RATING: 6.5
Such an awesome game.  I always have fun playing it but somehow I am always resist pulling it out a bit when my other half brings it up.  There are so many pieces and decisions to be made before you can even start playing... but then its pretty rocking.  You just have to get to that point.  And then I want to play about 3 games in a row... and then I don't want to play for a couple days.  If I had a table where the setup could chill for 3 days to a week while my interest for it built up again this would get played more often.

RATING: N/A
This Fantasy Battle Board Game comes with dozens of painted plastic miniatures, each representing a warrior from a different era, and hex-based hard plastic terrain pieces which can be put together in many different ways. The warriors include 30 plastic figures, including World War II soldiers, futuristic robots, aliens, a T-Rex-riding orc, a large dragon, and many more. Each hero or squad has its own card that details both movement and combat abilities.

RATING: 10
Wonderful game system. Prepainted minis, infinitely customizable maps, rules that can be explained quickly: safe for casual gamers. Not much depth, but there is room for tactical play. Looks great on the table, and most importantly, it's FUN.

A drawback: the "all genres" theme ends up feeling theme-less. 

EDIT: God I love this game. I could play every day! A "ten"

O.K. for a miniatures gateway.  Reasonably priced and available.  Pieces are fairly well done.  Terrain hexes are innovative and are universal for other mini-games.

RATING: 7
Setup can take as long as gameplay. Setting up the game board is like playing with Legos.  Which I have never been a fan of.  If the field of battle is already setup, you can increase this game's score by 1.

RATING: 8
     I was originally turned off by the simplistic rules of this feather-light wargame and shelved it for a while. Having played it many times now it really is enjoyable with tense battles and decent oppurtunities for tactical decision making. Also, it has personality up the keister.  The steady flow of affordable expansions keep things fresh and the customizable board affords limitless replay if you want to shell out the clams for extra sets.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I'll always have a soft spot for this game.  This probably shouldn't be a 10 because I'm sure if I played it as much as I would like I'd burn out on the randomness, plus it takes forever and a day to set up maps.  However, I just love, love, love the sound the minis make on the terrain when you move them around.

My son (6 at this time) plays this with me. I really enjoy playing this with him. We play the basic game. I started him with just a flat land with the ruins so he'd get used to the required dice to roll, and range and basic movement. He seems to really enjoy it too.

RATING: 4.5
Not a BAD game... just too much luck for me.  The best plan can be foiled by lucky/unlucky dice rolls.  It is for this same reason I don't care for Memoir '44 much either.  Between the two I would take Heroscape for its fun bits and humorous mixed themes (Men in Black vs. Mythical Dragon vs. RoboRats).

Not a game I would suggest or would want to own personally, but I'd go along with it if someone else wanted to play now and then.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
6: Doesn't see the play it used to.

7: Heroscape is a lot of fun. Great possibilities for the board and mixing up armies. But with three master sets and many army packs, the time to set up keeps this from coming out more. Sometimes I feel like playing but then I think about how long it will take to set everything up. This is a good game to get out for a day's worth of very light war gaming.

RATING: 9.4
This game is a lot of fun.  I love creating the different landscapes.  The one downside is the game can cost as much as you want it to--it's hard to stop with just one ROTV Master Set.  

The army customization is just right; you've got to think about how your cards might interact and how they might beat your opponent's army, but you only have a few units to remember in each game.  Good balance, that.

[i]*Own 7 copies of ROTV Master Set (terrain--one set of most ROTV miniatures), 4 of SOTM, 6 of BFTU, and multiple small terrain expansions.  Also have all the miniatures except the GenCon exclusives.  Multiple copies of most commons, except the out-of-print Waves 3 + 4.[/i]

RATING: 7
The outstanding modular terrain is really the star (especially for game designers or those who want nicer maps for their OTHER board games), but the minis, accessories, and all are very nice. It's still worth tracking this game down.

ADDENDUM: Months later, this remains one of my favorite games for 1v1, 2v1, and 1v1v1. It has both heavy and eclectic themes which play out in the units' abilities and behaviors. The base rules aren't the best, but even playing by those, HeroScape is great fun. Now that its popularity has lulled, it's easy to get your hands on lots of its material.

RATING: 9
Este juego es increíble definitivamente. Me encanta la manera en que se forman los distintos escenarios y el hecho de que se puede ocupar cualquier miniatura para jugar en ellos. El único lado malo es que está out of print y por lo tanto es caro conseguir los sets, además que el plástico está envejeciendo y cada vez se rompen más las piezas. 

9 - Excellent game. Always want to play it.

Lots of fun for my son and me, and a pleasant diversion from the relatively "dry" themes and gameplay that many of my favorite games carry.  A dicefest, yes, but there is some strategy to it.

The modular board is very nicely done, and the different terrain opens up possibilities not fully explored by the rules.  We've generally just built free-form landscapes and duked it out 'til only one team is standing.

We've got both master sets and enough expansion sets.   This rating encompasses all that.

This game is UGLY, horrible painting, horrible packaging, horrible marketing. The whole thing feels like some cheap american toy.. oh wait it is.

The gameplay itself is barely passable.

My second real boardgame purchase after "Battleball."  WH40k, WHFB and other minis games were always too time and money investment heavy for me.  For $40, I got a box full of pre-painted minis, tons of hex terrain usable in other games, and a clear and concise ruleset eminently suited to cusotmization.  It's also the first "geeky" game I coaxed my wife into playing, and she liked it.

What I like best about this game is the flexability and creativity it allows for.  I can see having quite a bit of fun for a long time with this game.

We ended up selling it because we wanted to keep up with all the expansions and that got just too expensive.  Sold it to a friends so we can still play when we have a hankering.

Great game that provides enough strategy for older gamers, but can still be played by/with younger gamers and enjoyed. Half the fun is creating your own gameboards to create different styles of terrain each session. A great online fanbase shares their maps & scenerios which provide great information to share. Much deeper gameplay than appears at first glance. This is a game that takes moments to learn to much time to master. Great game.

Doesn't really matter which Master Set you start with. Either it falls flat instantly for you, or you will buy anything you can get your hands on. At least, I can hardly imagine someone saying: '[i]Hm, this is a nice, well rounded game in this box, there's absolutely no need for boosters.[/i]'. The addictive nature of Heroscape comes from the vast number of thematically and mechanically different units you can pit against each other; Master Sets are just large boxes of terrain pieces, of which you can get never enough. 
Pure, unadulterated tactical fun with extremely high toy factor.

I LOVE this game! The concept is great, the gameplay is solid, and the fact that you can build your own map and draft your own army is AMAZING!!!! I'm so glad I got this game while it was still in print! It's one that I probably won't EVER get rid of/sell because the game is so good!

This type of game doesn't really appeal to me as it feels like a typical generic war game with a few odd rules (line-of-sight attacking, height advantages/disadvantages, etc.).  I did enjoy constructing my army of disparate soldiers from the unique possibilities provided by the game, but I quickly got bored with the actual gameplay once it got underway.  While I'm glad I got to play it once, I probably won't play this game again.  I can't say this is a bad game, but it certainly doesn't appeal to me.

It's hard to rate this type of game,since people who don't like miniatures battles games aren't gonna like it no matter how good it is.

I played this with my nephew, and it was merely okay. I'm not sure we were playing by the rules, since I never actually saw them, and many things seemed to go in a manner quite convenient for him. It didn't help much when I kept rolling nine dice and getting zero shields--I believe it happened three times. Yikes. It still was a close game, although I lost in the end.

Nice bits, simple combat system, seems to work all right. Maybe not deep enough for my tastes. This is one of those games that, given the motivation and time, I would completely rewrite to suit my desire for a more complicated, realistic tactical system. Then again, it features heroes with lasers and mofo guns fighting samurai and orcs, so realism isn't something this game cares much about. There's a reason armies gave up fighting with swords after guns were perfected. But taken for what it is, this might be a fun game with the right opponent, and the bits certainly are lovely. Why do the primitive types have ranged weapons that can shoot as far as the modern and futuristic types with guns and blasters and whatnot? This bothers me a great deal, but it does not seem to bother too many others. If you demand internal consistency in a game, this is not for you.

This is the board game equivalent of Angelina Jolie--a beautiful, sexy mess. I know it's flawed, but I stare longingly at it and dream of fondling the bits.

  After watching a bunch of kids playing this game at the library, and after purchasing the Marvel set and some more terrain/expansion packs, I'm thinking that maybe this should be a 6 instead of a 5. It's so easy to get into, and the scale issues with primitive versus futuristic ranged weapons can be solved so easily by not mixing those types, that maybe I was unfair in docking it a point for that.

Update: Okay, fine, it's a 6. Are you happy? Fine, it's a 7. Now are you finally happy? I certainly hope so, because that's absolutely, positively, the highest I can go.

I'm a bit amused by the Heroscape Weenies who are obsessive about using the "best" units and combos. I don't give a rat's you-know-what if cybernetic gorillas and fire elementals work well together. I just want to push my monkeys around and then set stuff on fire, okay? So get off my back about that.

Incredible value for money - 30 miniatures and a ton of plastic terrain for $55 - $90 AUD.

The basic rules are tedious - except as a primer in movement and the combat dice. The advanced rules are great though.

Looks fantastic when setup, low downtime, great ruleset (line of sight is handled beautifully!). Dice combat system is a luck fest, but a fun one.

I have played it 2 and 3 players. I can see this going over incredibly well with young kids (read: boys).

The tactical game for the common man (and his kid if he so chooses). Simple rules and no theme, but excellent and engaging gameplay. Stackable board and great figurines are icing on the cake. Even GF asked to play after seeing the board all set up!
Is missing OpFire, but this is easily fixed.

Great game, but as with all collectible games, it has tremendous balance issues. There are certain units that are cool to play but are useless if you're trying to win. Great production values - so much plastic; we may never see anything like this again.

RATING: 7
It deserves at least a 6 for the eye-candy factor. Gorgeous minis and terrain. There is space for a good strategy, which can mitigate luck factor. But, based on only one play, I don't know if there is enough depth, as I don't have to money to buy additional packs and patience to design scenarios. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
While the components were cool, the setup was really kind of long and difficult and the fighting and the characters were really not that deep. Plus I could see how one could get carried away and have 5 huge plastic bins to contain it all. I bought this at Walmart and I returned it =)

WOW!    Fast, fun, and looks pretty good on a table.   Very solid bang-for-the-buck.   I am very impressed, Hasbro.   
------------------------------------
Update (11/08/05)  I have chopped my rating a little bit for this.  I decided that it took a bit too long to setup to get a game in, but it is still fun.   Wish I had a better room where I could leave a standing board up.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Not anywhere near my sweet spot, but fun nonetheless. There certainly is a lot of flexibility within the system; one could play a very different game each time. The rules are reasonably clear and separated Basic vs. "Master", but I don't think that there is enough guidance on what makes a good map/scenario/etc. Not that I expect to be told the strategy, but especially when you add the expansions - and I do think you want a variety of terrain - the scenarios given are very limited. Yeah, there's information on the internet, but there's [i]too much[/i] of that.

RATING: 7
The level of customization is astonishing. Encourages players to create their own game variants, and opens itself up to endless hours of play. The best game about playing with toys around.

RATING: 6
Great kids game.  Introductory miniature battle game.  Seems flawed in that...since you can activate one of your figures for your whole turn...having a large army or just 1 is more or less the same.  But anyway, it was made to throw dice...lots of dice...make explosion sounds...etc.

RATING: 7
A great game that changes everytime you play it. I love the concept and the feel and flow of the game. I just hope they keep releasing and expanding, while not overloading the fans at the same time. Also, They need to make Snow and Lava Tiles, as well as including water tiles in expansion sets.

RATING: 10
The best miniatures skirmish game I've ever played.
This Master Set combines heroes and creatures from very different backgrounds, which is one of its attractives for me but may feel weird for new players.

PROS
- Amazing terrain: absolutely no other game looks this good when displayed on the table.
- Good-looking pre-painted figures.
- Easy to teach and learn.
- Simple atributes and powers system for the characters, with no complicated rules nor exceptions.
- Simple movement and combat system: no need for rulers nor any other components.
- High level of strategy with the possibility of bluffing and deceiving.
- The possibility of creating an unlimited number of scenarios and variants.

CONS
- The almost inexistent distribution in Spain.
- The fact that it has been discontinued for a lot of years, so finding material isn't easy nor cheap.

RATING: 9
The only reason it is not a ten is because we had to "house" some of the rules to get all the figures involved.  Once done however my sons and I have had some EPIC battles that have lasted days  (we have all the expansions).  Great fun especially if you have kids.

Playing with figures has never been this fun! LOTS of bits and pieces to play with and this game is all "toy" factor and it does have a really good system to support it. I really love the "build-your-own" terrain which lets to customize and literally build any type of playing field you want. Another plus to this collectable game is that the expansion packs are NOT blind so you know exactly what you're getting in each blister pack.

Very customizable and fun. The only downside is the preparation (which could take up to half an hour) and the clean up.

RATING: 8
9 for production quality, 4 for the boring, two dimensional rule set. I love setting up the board, and picking my figures, but after that, it feels pointless.

This copy belonged to my son (age 13), who, after being exposed to my many other games decided it was, "plebeian" [actual quote] and that it "takes too long to set up compared to the value of actual gameplay." [actual quote] I think he's been reading eurogamer comments and reviews personally... but there you go.

Anyhow, he demanded that I trade it for something better, and so I was putting it up in mathtrades for a while, with a very, very specific list of games that are, according to him, apparently not "plebeian." 

Traded away 5/14/09 in a mathtrade for Arkham Horror. I am happy, son is happy, the world is a better place.

===================

Ratings update to 8 on 5/1/13. Setup and played a MEGA game using 4 base sets, 3 expansions sets, and all the figures ever made. It was... wait for it... EPIC. We were trash talking like a ghetto basketball game, screaming at each other and our dice, and had epic fight after fight - Dragons versus Giants versus Sgt. Drake versus Samurai Versus Marro. Easily the most fun I've had in years.

So while the game may be on the light side, with the right opponents (high school kids) it's an absolutely blast to play.

Purchased a used copy that did not include everything, although it was promised. Used minis from other games, and it is still a lot of fun!  Trading it mostly for those who are already heavily invested in Heroscape.

For those interested in trading, it is missing the original rule book, a few terrain tiles (2-3 smaller ones), the ruin terrain pieces, as well as all of the minis.  All other parts have been accounted for.

The high rating reflects one of the best quality of game bits I have seen so far in boardgames.  In addition, my friends can't stop playing this game after game.

More sets or perhaps expansion may fix this problem.

HeroScape is easy and fun. It's a little like making a set-up with little army men. I play with one buddy most of the time. Buying a lot of expansions isn't worth it, but it is fun to pick up the cool-looking ones. The expansions do seem to go out of print, which isn't good.

Update: My buddy and I pulled this game out after not playing for a long while. After picking our decks, the game really seemed to play itself. There weren't too many decisions. It's still cool to look at, though.

Never played this game while it was in print. My coworker and brother in law played when it came out. Got my hands on it through a very awesome trade with a great thrift user. Instantly fell in love with the game. Stunning appearance. I love prepainted miniatures. I dont like that it is OOP. Makes the minis so expensive. 

Not really loving the MTG reprint style only because I know the game will cost a million dollars. 

I currently have 3 copies of the RoTV set.

A very expensive game to buy into. Half my fun is building the landscapes for the battles. After several expansions, we don't play much. The ability not to go head to head like many small mini games make this interesting. The hexes can be used to accentuate other features in other games though. (Make real hills and forests for games like memoir44, battlelore, etc).

This entry is for the main game and its expansions.  Simple, yet fun miniatures game.  Good starter game for those unfamiliar with miniature games, those too young for more complex games, or for those who are a little more laid back about it.  Board takes a long time to set up though.  Great game for young boys (or girls who are into battle things).

Never gets old. Perfectly playable with just the master set, but becomes a completely different, and even better, game the more figures and expansions you have. Only negatives are that it does take up space on the table and storage and that it is costly to have a complete set.

This is a game that you want to talk about after you've played it - lamenting your losses or basking in your victory. Considering what would have happened if that die had just rolled differently, or if you had moved that figure onto the high ground instead of near the trees. 

Played: At least 60 times.

I got so fed up with waiting for Hasbro to announce a UK release that I bought a copy off of e-Bay from a US seller just before Christmas 2004. The exchange rate is so favourable that including shipping I got it delivered for less than £30, which as I understand it is £10 less than its expected to retail for in the UK! 

Played (twice) for first time on 18th Jan 2005 and many times since.  Excellent fun and a high first rating due to the simplicity, excitement and visual impact.  We'll see if it stays so high after repeated playing!

...I'm now trying to get the various expansions from the states.

RATING: 6.5
3 copies.

A very good game with more strategy and tactics than many give it credit for. The game is interesting in the initial stages as you need to draft your army while taking into account the terrain of each scenario as well as beneficial and often symbiotic special powers of your various figures.
Game play itself is interesting as there is a nice balance between tactics,strategy and luck...one of the better mixes in any game I've played actually.

Replayability is enhanced by the many creative scenarios posted online as well as the ability to design your own maps and scenarios with the various terrain options. HS has a LOT going for it... plays well with 2-8+ players, is very different from one game to the next, encourages creativity in the scenario creation as well as the actual game play and as a bonus is a great family game to play with the kids. Downgraded to a 6.5 recently as the "spark" for this game has left me somewhat. Although this is the most played game in our collection...the need to keep things fresh with new expansions  can make the game a bit of a money pit.

At first I thought heroscape was a simplified miniatures game with cool minis and awesome terrain.  But as I have explored this game, I've really come to appreciate the incredible strategic depth it offers.  The toys are still awesome, but it is the mechanics that make this game shine.  Secretly issuing orders at the start of a turn adds an incredible amount of strategy.  And the rest of the rules strip away the frustrating parts of miniatures combat, allowing you to focus on the battle and not on the rules.  Add to that infinitely customizable scenarios, cool draft and constructed play, and room for literally any number of players, and this game is a 9, pure and simple.  Given enough time to play, I cannot imagine I would ever turn down a game of Heroscape.

Bought for the terrain bits, figures are ok, rules are extremely simple.  Good to get younger children into gaming.

Heroscape is great if you can find the time to set it up and play. The community of players produce some really interesting content. My favorite way to play is with all Marvel and DC heros from the fan created content. I can't believe this went out of print.

Collect'm all right? We have more minis then we know what to do with (and two full sets). I like to think of it as Warhammer 40K-light. Setting up the board is fun and the game looks really cool, the battles are big dice fests and it has plenty of satisfying light strategy. Something I've taught and continue to play with a youth group I volunteer with.

RATING: 6.5
Although it's almost more fun to put together the playfield, or use the pieces for other games, Heroscape is a decent game in its own right (at least with the non-basic rules). Not spectacular but good for when everyone is feeling some tolerance for high (but not extreme) randomness.

Does seem to play a little on the slow side, though, and the three-action-per-turn rule is probably my least favorite aspect. I realize those are potentially contradictions.

This is a pretty good game for my 5 year old and me.  Pretty bits, not too complicated, especially if you are playing the basic game.  Outside of playing it with my son, I don't think I'd be interested in playing it with anyone else.  Too simple and not enough strategy for my tastes.

RATING: 8
The best toy EVER! I love this stuff as an adult... I can only imagine how crazy for it I'd be if I was a kid! Beautiful plastic, painted miniatures, great terrain system, loads of cool extras like trees, and bridges, and castles, and more. Even the gameplay is good - simple, but well-designed, open-ended in that you can play published scenarios or just make up your own objectives, and a whole lot of fun. The only downside is that you need a large space to play and it's time-consuming (yet fun and creative) to create a battle field. Just a great product for kids that adults can enjoy just as much.

Setup is not so encumbersome with experience, and it's awfully pretty to look at once you're done.  The game isn't half bad, either.  Nothing phenomenally deep, but definitely some choices to find.  Formulating a viable team can be challenging in itself, and what constitutes viability changes with the board/scenario.


---update---

More expansions = more fun but also more setup/breakdown time.  This game would be a 10 in my book for replayability, quality of components, and all around fun.  The price and amount of time to set up and break down the game though does knock a point off.

The Background

I have become a late convert to Heroscape. Having walked past it on the shelves of various stores in Scotland, I saw an article on BGG stating it was for sale in Argos UK for the unbelievable price of £7.99, so naturally I succumbed and bought two.

I have two young sons aged six and ten and I am a kick in the backside off my sixtieth birthday. The three of us enjoy playing BattleLore, Memoir '44, Battle Cry and Descent. The kids certainly love the role playing aspects of Descent and have taken it to heart. Since playing Heroscape, Descent has not touched the table.

The Contents

So, why all the excitement? First of all you get a massive amount of plastic terrain; a veritable "Lego" set of hexagonal tiles with which you can create an endless assortment of three dimensional battlefields. These come in three colours: green representing grass, blue-grey representing rock and sand representing, well, sand. Bright blue water hexes are also included.

Then there are the figures. Thirty in the base set. These comprise heroes and squads and range from WWII airborne through robots and Vikings to dragons. Now this is a pretty eclectic mix but the gameplay allows you to bring them all together and after a while, you don't even think about matching up a secret agent with a winged warrior. The sheer look of joy on the kid's faces when they saw the variety and quality of the figures had to be seen to be believed.

The Gameplay

Now, my two little offspring fall into the demonic rather than the angelic category. They love gory movies and generally anything that has a bit of good old-fashioned slaughter and skulduggery in it. Heroscape is ideal for getting them battling across a table with miniatures rather than tearing lumps out of each other.

Each squad or hero comes with a card detailing statistics; how far they move, the range of their attack, their ability in defence and attack and how many hits they take before they croak. There is also a points cost which allows an army to be drafted. Two sets of rules are included: a (very) basic and a "master" set. Both the kids were into the master set straight away as it allows them to use each unit's special powers.

They and I took to it like a duck to water. I heartily recommend purchasing two sets if you have two kids. This avoids real bloodshed when they are drafting their armies and both want the same hero.

The Road to Perdition

Heroscape should carry a government health warning as it is totally addictive and has lead me to purchase several expansions. Trees, bridges, castles, glaciers and lava fields along with a multitude of extra troops will tempt you and melt the plastic straight through your wallet.

Naming and Shaming

We have ended up giving our own names to several of the characters and this reinforces the role-playing element. The agents below are Sean Connery, Morgan Freeman and Diana Rigg (Remember her from the Avengers anyone?). It can of course backfire. My ten-year-old was overheard calling Raelin "Twinkle-tits." I even have my own favourite - Maximus Phallus and the Ninth Legion - the kids don't speak Latin yet.

I rate this game a seven. That is my subjective judgement based solely on the great time I have playing it with my boys. It is not for everyone. I also play serious wargames and Heroscape is a delightfully different kettle of fish.

I have to say that this is probably my favourite game in general.  From the modular set construction to the easy to learn rules to the unlimited army combos, this game has it all!  Not to mention the sheer over the top geekitude that involves elements from pretty much every nerdtastic genre in existence.  Robots, zombies, ninja, samurai, matrix-y type people, super spies, dragons, dinosaurs, cowboys, knights, vampires, ghosts, goblins, cyborgs, commandos, gladiators, werewolves.....the list goes on and on.  Name your geek icon of choice.  It's probably in there.

RATING: 8
Skirmish in 3D terrain. The rules are somewhat simpler than in Star Wars Miniatures but the terrain is really, really neat. 

Setting up the terrain takes a bit longer than in Memoir 44. Cleaning up is the slower part. The game box is nearly useless when it comes to storing the bits. Or chunks, actually.

Not collectible, but there are numerous expansions available. The rule for combining common squads is quite neat, so there's some incentive for buying several copies of the same blister pack.

Why did it take me until October 2007 to discover the sheer coolness of this game? It's a lot of fun putting together the terrain over which you and your opponents will fight.  Cool pre-painted miniatures, quick game play and lots of characters with different abilities make this a winner in the 'Frag your Friends' category of 'beer & pretzels' gaming. Has a surprising level of tactical play.  Have 6 sets.

I like it almost entirely for the "theme" and the cool minis.  It is fairly light and luck-driven.  Considering the amount spent on this game and how rarely I play it, not a great investment.  Still, I want to buy more and more and more ... do I need to?  No.  The game plays just fine if you only have the master set.

edit: the kids love this game;  they love building jungles, ruins, mountains and so on and then fighting little battles in them

A simple and streamlined medium/light AT game, very good considering it is not a Euro. I only rate it slightly lower because of the very long set up time, but I guess some people enjoy building the maps like playing with LEGO.

Edit: Lowered my rating due to low replay value, long setup time. Always seems to take 2 or 3 hours to play a game of only "gateway" complexity. I would like this if it played in one hour.

Set-up is very time-consuming and similar to building Legos.  Unfortunately that often causes this game to be left on the shelf but, when built, its got some of the best looking terrain of any game I've seen.  The pieces come painted so you don't have to worry about that.

Its also a very fun, fast wargame with lots of cool characters and quick-to-learn rules.  Players roll skulls/shields for combat but the numerous special abilities add a ton of variety and strategy.  There's also a 'hidden order' to determine when figures act which creates a nice fog of war.

Muy muy entretenido e interesante. Ideal para toda la familia. Es rápido de jugar y a los niños les encanta construir sus propios escenarios. Como si jugaran con los legos ;-)

Últimamente lo estamos jugando cooperativo en plan laberinto/mazmorra con un jugador automático que funcione como adversario. Los jugadores humanos jugamos sólo con héroes (y, tal vez, sus tropas naturales) y sólo los héroes pueden renacer hasta tres veces (lo mismo ocurre con los héroes del contrario). EL objetivo puede ser sólo sobrevivir, o un rescate o la búsqueda de algún glifo, o algo de eso. Muy entretenido y diferente al típico ataque frontal. Da más sensación de aventura.

Incluso pueden hacerse campañas que incluyan verdaderas historias y se podría añadir algún elemento rolero (mejora de los héroes supervivientes, etc.) Ya se verá.

Actually, my son's game, but listing it here.  Fun game.  Setting up the terrain often seems to take longer than the actual gameplay itself, so it's best to run a scenario multiple times, but enjoyable, easy to learn, and quick.  Playing a single scenario is usually between 30-45 minutes.  Fun enough to engage and doesn't try to be "more than it is."  Not particularly wild about the collectible aspects, but that's really just me.

Balance between some of the characters in the game is a bit off, and the game is heavily reliant on luck (it's a dice-fest) but it's fun, it looks good, and it's got a neat concept (warriors from various time periods, real and imaginary, collide in battle).

Definitely the better of the two Master Sets because of the variety of characters. I love this game but it looks way too nerdy for casual gamers to try out. Capture the flag is much better than kill them all because it adds a level of strategy and chance even when you're out numbered.

Quick to learn, fun to set up, fun to build an army, fun and quick to play!  I think this in many ways is an ideal light tactical game.  The scale of the components is fantastic!  And the crazy mash-up of dragons vs robots vs dinosaurs vs samurai vs cowboys vs vampires etc, just tickles me pink!  So much potential for variation, customization and some great print-and-play expansions.  The Heroscapers.com and other online resources are fantastic!

My only negative, is that if you are a completionist, this might be a rough game on your budget as many expansions are out of print.

RATING: 9
(25+ plays)  Great interlocking terrain tiles for making all kinds of different scenarios.  A fun dice tossin' battle, but you have to squint a little at the rules sometimes.  Lots of special abilities for the figures to use interesting and creative strategies.  The expansions are spendy, but fun to play with.

I have a lot of Heroscape products, but I do not have a "collection".  It's one big game, and it's a play copy.  All of mine are opened and played.  They are kept in a series of totes in my garage, and played on big tables out there.  I consider this first release the main entry for the game, and record anything relevant under this title.

It's a good game, as long as you keep the pieces balanced and plan your strategy. I absolutely love the pieces and cards and think the board set-up (tiles) are extremely cool! It takes a bit to get things set-up and going, but I think it's worth it if you can find a worthy adversary!

Excellent components and decent rules.  Distribution for follow-on expansions is absolutely haphazard, making it very difficult to keep up with the 'complete' game.  Stands well on its own, but can get expensive if you're a completist.

RATING: 8
This was a lot of exhilarating fun when I got it, and has dwindled down a bit but to a more mature state. It is one of those games that you enjoy playing just as much as setting up. The pieces are pre-painted, and the simple mechanics can be explained to almost anyone in very little time. You can make a small game or a rather large one, a single bout or a full campaign. Lots of fan generated material to draw from. I am very happy to own a sizable amount of heroscape expansions, enough to keep me busy for years to come.

My favourite game of all time !!

Most fun game of all. The customization of your army and the tactical aspect of this game is endless. 

The peoples who dislikes this game have no idea how deep this game can be. All the depth comes from how you build you entire army and how will you use it against your opponents.

Sure there is luck factor with the dice mechanic, but it can be reduced by planning and optimizing your movements. The best players are usually the ones who considers their statistical probabilities and gauge their decisions accordingly.

I can guarantee that not a single new player would be able to beat me in his first 20 games at least, as characters knowledge and playing/knowing the match-ups are important parts of this game.

This game has it all, the artwork of the cards, the modular maps are amazing and the miniatures are cool and top notch quality. Creating the map is almost as fun as playing the game. 10/10 for components.

This game can be played free for all, 4 way battle royal, team matches, but the competitive gameplay is the head to head battle. One vs One is where this game shines and the main reason the tournament scene kept this game alive until today and probably for years to come. People are so passionate about this game that it exists hundreds of fan made character creations. Just to give you an idea how this game became a cult over the years.

We played hundreds of times with families, friends, neighbours... Won numerous organized tournaments against other top players. I've done it all.

I would recommend it to everyone. Best game of all time easily !! It's now a classic as I don't believe another game with the same quality as Heroscape will see the day.

RATING: 7
It would rate higher for me if it were quicker to put the terrain together. I can see where it is fine for the target audience where several games in a row, even of the same scenario, are probably played. However, for a play during a game night session, the setup/actual play time ratio is a bit high.

Well put together with strong replayability for such a basic game.  Takes a while to set up a scenario for how long you get to play, but this is fixed by playing best of 3 (or 5, or 7, or n*2+1).  Taken over Mage Knight, this is much more accessable for all involved, as there's much less to memorize in terms of creature interaction.

Heroscape is one of my favorite games.  I love building the map, although I usually build them way too big and the game takes forever.  Still, the versitility of units you can be is endless, I don't think I've probably used half of the guys availble in actual games.  It's also a game that is accessable enough to people with simple enough rules that most anyone I've met likes it, even if they are skipbo and yahtzee people.  This master set comes with a lot of units and plenty of terrain.  Although I recommend getting all of the expansions as well!!

Heroscape.....How I love thee
This game got me back into gaming after a 20+ year absence.  
So much has been said about this great game already:
Amazing terrain
Simple rules
Nice prepainted miniatures
Just incredible value for original MSRP

If you don't like this game you truly don't know how to let loose and have fun

If you have any of the Master Sets, which are now sadly out of print, do yourself a favor and pop over to Heroscapers.com.  Check out the awesome customs that the C3V and SoV guys have done to keep this game fresh.

Honestly, for the amount of fun in this game it is even worth the ridiculous prices being commanded on ebay.

Originally I was not impressed with the game play found in Heroscape. Yeah the eye candy was there but where was the depth. Having played 'deeper' miniature games and many games of Mage Knight (as well as the other 'clix' games) I had to re-evaluate my thoughts on this game. 

What caused me to re-think Heroscape was the fun factor. In every other mini's game, there is always some struggle with the rules (or the damned rulers); at times this sucked the fun out of the game. I can say that I have never played a game of Heroscape when this occurred; I have never played a game that wasn't fun. 

It requires little effort to introduce new players, set up balanced armies, etc. Complexity is not equivalent to 'good'. Heroscape is 'good'. It does what it expected and does it well.

Though it had taken awhile before I recognized the excellence of this design but I finally saw it. 

This is a great game.


Note: I have little more than the original base set and it has served me well.

RATING: 8
The figures are beautiful and the terrain is like minecraft made physical. I love building the maps and then designing the armies. Games go quickly, and the limitation of only allowing three groups to activate per round is really nice. It puts this powerful power limiter that makes something this scale manageable.

I also love the sanity rules of 'if the mini can see the other mini it has line of sight' and the 'if the guy can't fit in that space, he can't go through that underpass'.

It does use dice for combat, so the best laid plans can be foiled by a bad roll, but that comes with the territory sometimes.

There are tons of figures and expansions available for this game. For the most part it's balanced, using the points system to purchase army cards before the start of the game. That being said, it's not 100%. Make agreements with players before selecting armies about what sort of armies are going to fight. Don't pair an army of elves vs the Incredible Hulk.

Set-up and take-down time really kills the fun of this game. This game is not for someone who wants to jump right into a game. If you just play one game, it is about a 1/1 ratio of build time to gaming time. The rules are clear and easy to learn. I have to say that the game was more fun that I thought it was going to be. The rules are easy to learn. If you have room to leave this game set-up and ready to play, then add a couple of points to my rating.

Probably the best boardgame for me with Star Wars Epic Duels Game. More a toy than a game, lot of luck involved and some tactic, but... what a FUN blast! Really, really fun, with fantastic components (...but terrible box, at least for the first base set!)
This game is simply awesome: a real system, simple, modular and with high custom possibilities for a literally endless experience. I play on large maps adding a very light quest system and an area-control mechanic, both generating Victory Points as a win condition; the game is more intriguing now, not completely focused on random skirmishes, while the additional mechanics incentivize a better map exploration. Also, the quest aspect adds an exciting adventure feeling.
My rate of 10 is for the entire Heroscape saga, not only the Rise of the Valkyrie set.

I have 5 starter sets, 2 Marro starters (with some more spare parts), 3 Forgotten Forest, 3 Tundra (with some more spare parts), 2 Jungle, 2 Fortress, 2 Volcarren and all the expansions and promos, plus a bunch of doubles (all common squads 3x/4x/5x), over 100 custom figures (Mage Knight, World of Warcraft, Horrorclix and D&D Miniatures, all re-based) and some custom terrains.
I have also the Marvel set but I don't like it very much and I use it generally on its own (and very rarely).

I bought Battle for the Underdark (2 sets) and the 3 D&D Waves (all 3x/4x), but I don't like the miniature recycling Wizards of the Coast did with the game; despite some good interactions and mechanics, D&D Miniatures are clearly different in quality, colours (some are also really bad painted) and out of size. For me the 'real' Heroscape ends with Wave 10.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Fast paced, super customizable and provides a unique set of results each time played.

I'm not into what I consider "grinding miniature" games (see W3K) - so this set, light in complexity, is right up my alley!

That all being said, it would be nice if the terrain was sold separately.

I tried to stay away from this marketing machine, but in the end I fell for it.  Why?  Not because of the great game-play (which is o.k., but light), but because my kid loves the bits.  When we play it's clearly with the stipulation that we don't use the rules.  He gets the bad guys, I the good, and he must ALWAYS win.  Bottom line, this is a great toy that also happens to be a game.

What a fantastic game.  Really simple, yet deceptively deep.  And once you've added in all those extra figures, boy does it shine.  I'd rate it an 8 for the Master Set on its own, 10 with a big pile of boosters.  But only a 5 if you insist on using the basic rules. 

Several months on from writing the first paragraph, I'd like to change my rating.  Except that - unlike Nigel's amp, BGG doesn't go all the way to 11.  So it will have to remain a 10.  

It may not be the "best" or the "cleverest" game ever invented.  But because of the almost limitless variety - and the huge amount of fun this game is - if I could only own one game, Heroscape would be the one.

The best miniatures game out there for light wargaming with a fantasy, kid-like feel to have FUN with. After reading about and playing hundreds of different games, I still come back to Heroscape as hitting the right sweet spot between casual and competetive miniatures play. The pre-painted figures and 3D hex terrain makes it very appealing and easy to enter into a light miniatures game. The hodge-podge of themes, time-eras, dinosaurs, army men, aliens, historical, and creatures is a dream for light-hearted players who always wanted to battle them together. Literally, this is the game I waited my whole life for. It's the perfect blend of chunk and kid-like appeal for imaginative fun for all ages and genders. And with the deals that have been available ($20 for the entire RotV Master Set?), it is a no-brainer to pick up if there are players it would remotely appeal to.
Biggest drawback is how the dice regularly make a mockery of turn order, positioning, unit choice, and any other strategy. 
Best house rules (if less randomness is desired, or if ranged units are overly dominating) are:
1) Allow players to change in (before rolling) 2 attack dice for 1 skull, 3 defense dice for 1 shield, and 6 Valkyrie dice for a Valk symbol.
and
2) Eliminate the elevation bonus for ranged attacks. There's zero thematic justification for benefiting elevated ranged attacks, and lots of in-game reasoning to not provide it (makes ranged too dominant).

Fun if taken for exactly what it is: a light, beer-and-pretzels romp. Though there is a modicum of strategy (with positioning, LOS, elevation, and such) it mostly boils down to the luck of the dice. However, it does fill a good niche: a miniatures wargame for non-wargamers (and kids).

fun little game. not too deep, but actually has more depth than you would think, as the various variable powers of the different units adds a pretty neat bit of depth to game play for a light game. fans of memoir 44 and the like will like this game. i can't see myself playing this every time it comes out at the game group, but i would gladly play on occasion. 

update: o.k., so i have been playing this game a little bit lately, and i've been having a lot of fun. yeah, it's just a kid's game, but there are enough tactical elements here with the variable powers of the various figures to keep me entertained. the bits are super fun, and i enjoy building the senarios as much as i do playing the game. yes, i'm a nerd, but i'm o.k. with that.

This is a fun fun game. Things that make it tough to play is just the set up time. Our gaming group must have at least 10 base games and most if not all the expansions.

For a bucket-o'-dice (TM) game, this one is OK. Not a huge deal to think about, but at least combat is resolved quickly and the game looks fabulous.

My brother is a huge Heroscape fan.  He's got a ton of stuff, so when we play, he usually lets me pick out my army first.  That's nice because he is way better at the game and it gives me a fighting chance to win.  I really enjoy the variable player powers involved with each of the different squads/guys.  It's almost more fun to put a team together than it is to play the game.  If it were as fun to play as it is to create a team of guys, HeroScape would be rated a lot higher.  But it's not really.  I do enjoy seeing how my choices affect the game play, but not so much that HeroScape is a game that I always want to play.

I used to play this a lot when I was younger, and I recently found it after having lost it for a few years. Picking it back up, it's still as fun as it was back then. Building your own map (and your army, for that matter) is part of the fun of the game and the actual combat and gameplay is fun as well. Yet another game I'll always enjoy playing.

RATING: 8
Two complete sets. Great game. I got into this game around December of 2008. I spent the Christmas season madly dashing around Indianapolis picking up all the various expansions and master sets I could find. At that time, most master sets were selling for $20 or less in the area. I have 2 of every master set (except Battle for the Underdark which I have 1 of). I also have all of the Flagbearer's and at least one of most small pack character expansions (at least up to the D&D releases). 

My one sticking point is never being able to find the Road to the Forgotten Forest at a decent price. Having the Bridge and Tree's would be huge. Then again, the massive box I store everything in can barely close right now.

Generally speaking I have at least one of every booster from waves 1-8. I am missing a few, and have duplicates (triplicates?) of a few as well.

Low skill, high fun game designed to introduce youngsters to the hobby.  For this it is excellent.  A 6 yr old can grasp the Basic game and an 8 yr old should be able to play the Master game.  Doesn't seem to reward manoeuvre or teamwork very much, and does take quite a while to set up.  Bump up rating if you like miniatures in your games.

Do not waste time with the basic game.  It is bland and not that fun.  Head right to the "master" game and get ready for a super fun ride.  The multi-genre battles that ensue are fun for kids of any age - intro level tactical battle decisions to be made, uproarious swings of the dice ensue and a good time it had by all.  

Great game!

MUST HAVE BOY TOY
My rating is a 7, my 8 year old son would give it a 10!  Some of the negative comments for this game are based on set-up time.  Personally, I think half the fun is setting up the battlefield (we rarely if ever use the official scenarios).  My younger son (now 7) renctly played full game with basic rules.  Previously he just enjoyed playing with the bits.  A very cool game that can be enjoyed on a number of levels.  Additional expansions not necessary for enjoyment but a little dangerous for those of us without a lot of self control when it comes to game acquisition (which is likely you if you are reading this).

Dropped to an 8 for me.  I love the bits and the fact that I don't have to buy and paint minis to play it.  I've added a few extra bits to the master set to expand the game a little.  Overall a very simple and enjoyable game.

Did not want to buy this, mostly because it was way too expensive and expandable. When it was offered for less than half price, and I learned that no expansions would come out in the Netherlands, I decided to try it. This game is fun building up your scenario (when the old Lego spirit is indulged again), but not too sure about actual play fun...

Of all the games I own, this games has the most yelling and taunting of any of them. This is due to the constant dice rolling for attacking and defense. I played this a ton for a while and it's gone into storage for a few months now. TIme to bring it back to the table.

Just far, I've played 3 or 4 times and it's yet to get old.  The terrain is almost as fun to play with as the game itself.  Trying to build canyons, bridges, caves, and trying to make the map as interesting as possible is awesome.  The figs are of a surprisingly high quality, and there are enough different units to try to keep it interesting.  I highly recommend.  Only drawback is that it takes a while to break down the board after you're done.

I started down this path by messing with Warhammer 40k but my son and I were wholly uninterested in modeling and I was turned off by the ridiculous pricing and the unique brand of warhammer grognards. I work with a guy that played this with his family and he claimed that they loved it so I bought it. It's OK. The game is relatively fun and kids have a good time with it. My main complaint is the *enormous* setup and cleanup time it takes. It's a lot of inertia to overcome whenever the game is suggested. The setup usually takes 1.5x what it takes to actually play the scenario...

So far, I've only played this game once. It dropped a half point based on some folks not enjoying it as much as I had hoped. However, I will be playing again this weekend and my rating my rise or fall depending on this subsequent play. 

No matter how I rate this overall, the components themselves rate an 11.

#################################
I have since played this game several time and given the half point back. This game stands up to repeated play and for a dice heavy game has plenty to hold my interest.

I just love it.

###################################
Okay, I'm changing my rating for this one AGAIN. This time to match the criteria of the "Rate it or Don't" system. I'm giving it a 10. Because "Always want to play and expect this will never change."

I had been rating games based mostly on execution of the mechanics and overall appeal. However, even with the flaws in HS, I will always be willing to play and I don't think this will EVER change.

I'm currently 2-3-1 against Noah. He's a prodigy.

9-22-11: I can play the basic game with my 5 year old, for that alone I love it. He can put a map together, pick an army for the both of us and we can go at it. I can't wait until we can play the master game.

11-05-11: We're transitioning into the Master game, using the turn order shields and hit points, but no special powers (except flying) since he can't read yet. It's all coming together.

12-30-11: Played Marvel Master set alone. It is definitely fun playing super heroes, we can't wait to bring everything together.

Always entertaining, whether you win or lose. The battles (at least mine) tend to be fast & furious and are over before they begin to drag. The big minus comes from the fact that it takes so long to set up... and unfortunately, the game's biggest appeal comes from that.

Rápido con las reglas básicas, pero demasiado sencillo. Con las avanzadas gana mucho. Lo más destacable es su tablero modular de hexágonos de plástico rígido. Para algunos es más atractivo montar el tablero que el juego en sí. Volver a meterlo en su caja después es otra historia.

My two eight year old boys love this game and I have a lot of fun playing it with them. Within a couple plays they were helping me with special powers and rules.

I find this game very enjoyable. I love the creatures. I love the tiles that you can use to build your OWN map. Simple rules with lots of decisions. Some may say that combat system is a bit simple, but hitting your opponent only to see them blocked is what this game is all about.
I have played with both youth and adults and we always have fun playing the game.
It can get a bit expensive with all the expansions, but I buy them, because they get used! 
I will never turn down a game of Heroscape.

RATING: 9
My most played game currently, although most of the plays were over a year ago.  I love the game, but the one big strike against it is that it's such a hassle to haul everything out of the closet and set it all up.  Sad to see it no longer being produced.  I would have continued buying. 

Update 12/2013: Not most-played any more, as I passed it with A Touch of Evil earlier this year.  I haven't really played this at all lately, because it's such a chore to get everything out.

Update 7/2015:  Not played at all anymore.  In fact, the thought of dragging all the boxes down and trying to sort through everything usually kills any interest in playing before I actually do it.  I really enjoyed this for a few years though and spent a ton of money on it.  Downgrading the rating from 10 to 9.

Set up the terrain however you imagine, pick your army and off you go! Will you choose Vikings, fire breathing Dragons or Ninjas? There are tons of pre-painted miniatures to pick from! Use the terrain to gain an advantage over your opponents or just to hide from them. The rules are simple, easy to learn and make sense. Because this game is so fun and can be played in so many different ways, you need to add it to your collection.

Really fun, light game - great game for my kids.  We like the battle mechanics with defense rolls much better than the "attack roll only" mechanic in Commands and Colors (the other war game system with special dice that I've commonly played). It would be nice to incorporate some way of varying the # of dice rolls for ranged attacks (low when close or really far away, with some midpoint sweet spot for max attack dice).  It can definitely be addictive, wanting to get all the different sets, which is especially difficult now that it's out of print. I might rate it higher as I delve into more custom maps with interesting scenarios and win conditions - I like the capture the flag/race for the flag type scenarios, where killing each other is secondary.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I love this game. The prepainted figures that are nearly indestructable (relatively speaking) are great. Yeah, it's expensive and I don't play it enough, but I don't think I'll stop expanding anytime soon. The variation of units, maps, scenario rules/objectives, and players give this one nearly limitless replayability. Lots of fan based content online makes this an even better gem. I'd rate it a 10 if it didn't take so long to set up and take down, but not much I can do about that.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
A plethora of highly detailed pre-painted figurines and the ability to easily build your own 3d terrain makes this game awesome. The best way to get the most out of this game is to have a lot of terrain tiles. I have what is I consider the minimum; all the core sets and a few hundred random hexes from ebay.

For addons I recommend Orms return, as its still fairly cheap and works great with the next best core set after this one: Swarm of the Marrow. I highly recommend this game.

[b][color=#CC0000] 

Essentially a perfect game.  I'm not just talking gameplay -- I'm talking the entire execution of the product.  This is a game designed to appeal to ages 3 through 100, has magnificent components that are designed to be brutalized by small children with little or no damage resulting, and to appeal to all on three levels -- building, role-playing, and competing.  Nothing in the marketplace is at the same level as Heroscape from an overall packaging perspective.

Available for $18US for a period of time, I simply don't think any other game has ever provided this level of value at this price point.  Or even close.  None ever will again, because the nature of the World's economy has fundamentally changed.  The door has closed on this level of material for that kind of price.

Fun game.  Great for boys between five and ninety-five.  I've played the advanced rules with my five-year-old twins.  A bit of patience was required, but they had fun.  The big pieces make for an impressive look and feel which is not lost on kids.  Many expansions -- you [i]could[/i] drop a few buckazoids on this critter, but you don't [i]have[/i] to.  Requires a bit of time and space to set it up, but once it's there it is positively glorious.  The quality of the components is simply magnificent -- gorgeous AND tough.  

My kids love all aspects of it -- playing pretend, setting up the boards like a puzzle, playing.  This is THE game for young boys of this generation to own.  This is the one they'll talk about with each other on the golf course fifty years from now.

This basic set is the one to go for -- nice variety of pieces and plenty to play with -- you need never buy an expansion.  Simple rules means thirty minutes to master the concepts, then you can play for hours.  Short quick battles, huge drawn-out campaigns . . . anything is possible given the modularity and variability of the pieces and their basic concepts.  

Simply the best birthday present you'll ever give a seven-year-old boy.  If you see this grab two copies -- you'll likely have grandsons someday.

This is a rating for the Heroscape system as a whole, rather than this specific set.

A moment of silence for Heroscape, the game that tried to make minis games as accessible and straightforward as they possible could be. That it succeeded so wildly is admirable, and over a decade removed Heroscape still is an impressive game. The physical production is unmatched, and will likely remain so. It's incredibly easy to just throw together a board and bash out a 45 minute scenario, but you can also throw things together and create something genuinely epic. It's a really fun game, and I wish it could have gone on for longer.

I bought the marvel set of this game first and was dissapointed because of limited terrain and the marvel characters were very powerful to the point where it took forever to kill anyone. This master set is what I was looking for. The game has some powerful characters but most can be killed fairly easily. I absolutely love this game. This game has qualities I was looking for in other games but could not find until I found this game. I love that each character has both a visual and power based personality. This causes me to really like certain characters and makes the game as good as it is as far as I am concerned. Right now this is my favorite game.

Looks cool.  Very simple.  Aside from the looooooooong setup, this is a great game if you want to have miniatures do battle. I ended up selling my collection to fund other games, but if you own it and set it up...I'm game.

RATING: 9
Fantastic game.

I was dubious at first, but followed the advice of many on the Geek. The theme, whilst slightly childish, is also quite amazing and gives scope which is practically unequalled. 

The game-play has a simplicity which makes even the so-called 'advanced game' far simpler than most in my collection, but has enough tactics and options to keep you going back again and again. The luck-element is important, but can easily be offset by proper army construction and other things. Whilst I've played 'deeper' games, and I've played games which are 'better' with more innovation or thought behind them, you'd be hard-pressed to find a 'funner' game.

This base-set alone has enough terrain to make dozens of different set-ups, with elevation, rivers, caves, and ruins all being possible in many combinations. Coupled with other packs, this provides a game with huge re-playability and fun.

This game rocks, and if there were more mainstream kids' games like this, I don't think there'd be much need for the niche adult hobby. Seriously. Well, kind of. I set it up for a ten year old nephew. We played three games in succession, and the whole experience was too awesome for words.

My wife picked this up in a charity shop, and although I was aware of the following for this game, I foolishly thought that was just owing to the prepainted minis. The game system is really good - simple, but dynamic and rewarding of thought and tactics. Plus very flexible - when I start playing this with my kids, I may bother to knock up cards for all the minis I have from various other games.

Owned it and selled it after a few plays. It really is more to play with children. The theme is ridiculous and the system is totally luck driven. For a game that is so luck driven I rather play Pickomino than Heroscape because it also has an enourmous setup time.

Miniatures for dummies, just for what we came:  Move, check range and attack.  As easy as that.  Oh, and defend, if you are attacked.  Anyone can play and everybody will enjoy.  A game for all.  Its major flaw:  Its neverending setup time; that along brings its rating down to an 8 from an otherwise easy 9.

I bought 1 Master Set but several multiples of most Boosters and a ton of terrain tiles on e-bay. I like playing themed armies, Romans versus Orcs or Marro or something.

The terrain is adaptable to A&A minis and other games. 

The real "strategy" is drafting an appropriate force for the battlefield. The more expansions one has, and in many cases that means duplicates and triplicates of boosters, the more strategies one can implement.  

Tactically HS is not exactly a brain
burner but the combination of melee, ranged and flying units does allow tactical players to establish kill zones of combined arms so to speak. Actually it is a better tactical game than M'44. 

But I don't get to play it often at all. Ya see, two of my gamer friends either don't drive or don't have a car. I'd like to leave it set it up here  and have folks over to play.

Awesome components.  I have never purchased a game (at retail price, at least) with this much value before.  Solid (albeit simple) rules.  The main thing, though, is that the game is FUN.  As lots of other people have said, it's not nearly as deep as some other games.  But it's not supposed to be.  For the bang for your buck and fun factor, I don't think it gets much better than this.

I'll preface this with the statement that miniatures games are not my cup of tea.  I do however see the he allure of this game -- great bits, easy availability, and pretty good rules.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
This is an important step "back" for commercial boardgames, in so many ways. Just imagine if Heroscape were designed as a collectible game -- it would only have, at max, a 9 month life-span!

Just deviating from the collectible market allows the game to return to proper strategy game roots, (not the common, uncommon, rare hierarchy) and it's there in the drafting, the troop movement/engagement rules, the height advantage, and the glyphs. The rules form an interesting skein. All of these things together and the open-ness make this the "Unreal Tournament of Board Games", and that also means an endless stream of fun mods for years to come.

Hasbro has been experimenting with low-run, high quality toys in the past years since Pokemon (Xevoz for instance), so it would be nice to see them apply that niche-friendly model to this game for another year and a half at least.

I would not normally have thought I would ever like a game like this one, but I got it as a gift...and loved it.  Imagine a 10 year old taking their mixed up toybox of random plastic soldiers from all eras, plastic space explorers, little dinosaurs, fast-food restaurant toys, ponies, gremlins, unicorns, plus every imaginable 1/6 scale action figure...and somehow making a light tactical wargame out of it!...which is more or less what highly imaginative children do when they throw all these things together and create little towns, villages and battles from an enormously disparate collection of unrelated toys.  Add in Legos, Megablocks, Lincoln Logs and Tinker Toys as terrain, and Voila(!)...you've got HeroScape!!  Not to be taken too seriously, but really fun (surprisingly so).  Unfortunately I could never get any of my "serious" wargamer friends to play, and after playing only three times in my life, all of which were with my 11 year old youngest daughter...I had to sell it all off.

For those like me who are dying to get into miniatures wargaming, but do not have the time to paint and assemble figures and terrain, Heroscape scratches the itch quite well.  However, as a base game, the rules are a little too simple.  But it seems that they were intentionally left open-ended so that each owner could customize the rules to the complexity they want.  So, with a little house-ruling, this can be the game you want, at a fraction of the cost of something like Warhammer.

It is certainly worth the little extra effort.  Not to say that even the base rules are no fun--they are fun indeed.  I was really surprised by this game.

[1 play] Cool bits, very nicely produced, small amounts of interesting decision making, and fun for a short time. If I was 10 years old when I first saw this, it might have been the greatest game ever.

Played once, in a four-player (2 vs 2) capture the flag scenario with 500-point armies. Setup time was formidable, but kind of fun in it's own way, like playing with Legos. The rules were clean, simple, and functional. and the miniatures, the castles, the dice and the terrain were lots of fun to play with. Playtime was shorter than setup and takedown time. Combine that with the obvious cost and storage issues, and Heroscape will remain that I will enjoy playing but never buy.

Though not my favorite I will say it is the perfect game. Because it is not just a game but a system in which you can create your own games. The only reason I don't give it a 10 is because of the immense setup and clean up as well as storage needed for it. Still we have created tournaments with special rules, themed battles you are really only limited by your imagination (and the size of your collection)

I'm not going to bother adding ALL the expansions. This listing includes ALL of Heroscape.

A tough one to rate.  The gameplay is lacking, in my opinion:  not very dynamic after all the pieces start engaging.  But the game is SO versatile that it should be easy to fix any problems that you have with it with funky scenarios and house rules.  An EXCELLENT game to play with kids.  I'd rate it a 10 as a children's game.  It could be played with kids from 4-16 years old, again because of the versatility (there are basic rules that are VERY basic).

HeroScape. Many argue, "It's a toy more than a game!" Others reply, "It's a game more than a toy!"

Relax. It's both, and it's quite engaging. The ability to battle it out between heroes from across all space and time on an infinite variety of battlefields, where the victory conditions are limited only by one's imagination, is a lot of fun.

The units are varied and interesting. Building and designing new battlefields keeps things exciting, and the game can be easily played with 2-4 players. It is also fairly accessible to younger players.

The luck factor is there (although it seems higher than it actually is), and that can be a turn-off for some people, but it also induces nail-biting tension. The tension is great, but it would be nice to have some rule variants that diminish the luck a little bit, as it can seem overwhelming at time. (Update: playing the Master game with the Basic game's turn structure balances the game more to my liking - it increases the ability of a player to pursue an effective strategy and diminishes the chance of rolling for initiative, and makes the game more fun to play - and faster to boot. But for those considering playing with this rule alteration, I recommend playing the Master game as is first.)

I can't think of any other game that's as fun to both play and play WITH! It's also expandable! The game is fairly light, but the simplicity of adding house rules can make it heavier. I think the first expansion is the best.

CHILDREN'S RATING: 8.5

Am finding this is a fun option for small children - playing with the basic rule set. You can contextualize the characters as doing battle with other as part of a contest of some sort where losers have to sit out to the next game. "Killing" isn't really a necessary aspect of HeroScape. Little ones will also enjoy making up stories with the characters for imaginative play. You should hear my daughter tell her stories about Deathwalker, Mimring, and Raelin. They are hilarious and entertaining. She also really enjoys building the battlefields.

Update: The synergy that can be generated between different sorts of units is like a Magic: TG - "lite". The intricacy of both strategy and tactics increases and the luck factor decreases. Good drafting becomes much more important. With the expansions in play, of course, the game becomes more difficult to win for a child playing against an adult, but things are easily leveled out by giving the child more points with which to draft.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Some call it a kids game, or a game for adults who don't want to grow up.  Maybe it's true.  However, this game is a lot of fun, because you can do so much with it.  Can be kind of expensive when you start adding on expansions, but most of them are definitely worthwhile.

I guess this game is OK.  I suppose.  It certainly has a wonderful board and very nice figures, and the rulebook is very well done.  However, gameplay with the rules as printed is a little lackluster in my book.  (I am sure that there are some good home mods out there that spruce up the rules and the combat and the terrain, but who has time for all that?)  Strategy is not overly deep and there seems to be an annoyingly large number of dicerolls.<BR><BR>Memoir '44 and Battle Cry have similar gameplay elements and are much more enjoyable games, in my opinion.

One of my favorite games of all time. It certainly isn't the most complex deep games of all time, but it doesn't claim to be. The components of this game have yet to be matched.

Ever since a child, I wanted my action heroes to be able to battle each other in a structured way.

RATING: 3.5
Really nice concept of a game.  The bits are pretty.  I like making the terrain and moving the pieces around, I like the line of sight bit, but ultimately it feels like any other race to the middle to beat each other up game.  I wasn't sure if there was any more to this.  Perhaps there is and I'm just not seeing it.  My feeling is that if it were easier to hit people, but harder to kill them you might get more emotionally invested in the little dudes.  As it stands I just don't feel anything overwhelmingly compeling about the gameplay.  Too many dice, no real surprises other than what ends up getting rolled.  I was waiting for a real decision.  It didn't happen.

Just an all around fantastic game.  Great rules and logical mechanics.  Super value for your money with the starter set.  Terrain is a blast to build with.  Buying add-ons is addictive.  Add-ons are NOT necessary to enjoy the game.

HeroScape is the kind of game where you want to dedicate a table to it in your home.  That way you can build a large layout and leave it up for months.  Playing on it again and again while tweaking the terrain here and there.

Interesting little affair.  I played this one evening against a friend and we had a good time trying out some of the suggested scenarios and board layouts.  He was a previous miniatures gamer, and I had never before played any miniatures games, but we both found it to be a good time.  I would be interested in playing this again to work through the scenarios,  but I see this one appealing to a smaller group of gamers than most of the titles in my collection.  
I've improved my rating in relation to some of the new expansion sets.  The versatility of the terrain plus the wide array of new figures available makes this quite a good game, and I would play it more often if I had somewhere that I could leave the board up and ready to play.  
----
My only complaint is that it always seems that there is a bit of downtime for each player in a multi-player game.    I played this one late at BGG.con, and I was zoning off on other players' turns because I wasn't involved in the action.  Perhaps simultaneous action for pairs of players when the scenario is large enough to warrant it.

The components were of good quality, and I enjoyed the variance of the characters.  Yet the gameplay was fairly simplistic, and the board not very evocative.

RATING: 7
With the understanding that I've played only twice, I think the game is being highly over-rated. It boils down, after all, to a dice-roll game. Setup and breakdown time is enormous and annoying, as is the fact that the components do not go cleanly back into the box. Much ado about nothing, it seems. Half hour to set it up, 20 or so minutes to decipher the rules and when it comes down to the battle(s), you roll a bunch of dice and win or lose. It's like playing the old card game War with your 5-year-old. The "pieces" are absolutely awesome, but a more elegant strategy and tactics game would have been preferable. That said, I'm going to attempt a deeper understanding of the "armies" and their varied powers to see if the sought-for elegant game emerges.

I run a board game club for young teens at the local library and for months all they would play was Nexus Ops. I couldn't find anything else they would even consider playing twice until I brought in a master set of Heroscape. They absolutely loved this game. I think it's a fun light wargame and I love creating my own maps and scenarios for it. It's hard not to rush out and buy ever expansion for it once you get into it. But somehow I've managed to resist...for the most part...

Provisional rating. This is almost definitely bound to go up.

Edit: Tracked down all of the Master Sets and most of the unit expansions and I've got just about a complete collection now. Fab stuff! Not worth marking it all as 'owned' here, though, as it clogs up the list big-time, but I'm managing what's left to track down in my Wishlist.

And good lord, it is SO difficult to find some of the middle Waves. Time to step up that reprint schedule, Wizards!

Edit update: Or not. R.I.P., Heroscape. You will live on in our hearts and on our tabletops.

Final update: I. OWN. EVERYTHING. I HAVE COLLECTED THEM ALL.

This game is what it is: a very simple game with a strong production value.  Do not buy it if you are looking for a good minis game; buy it if you are looking for cheap minis, cheap (but somewhat ugly) plastic hex terrain, and a passable set of bare bones "Attacker rolls number of dice times strength, defender rolls number of dice times defence" type of ruleset.

This game is just pure fun to play.  It's not a game for die hard strategy gamers but if you want something that is not complicated then this is the game.

My only real complaint about this game is that it is a major pain to setup and cleanup sometimes.

This is a great, simple minis game that incorporates line of sight, elevation, attack and defense ratings, range, and all sorts of cool powers.  I am a bit dissatisfied with the activation rules that let the most powerful guys move over and over while the other characters just sit there.

Update: I am really into this now.  The boys play this all the time so it is a great father-son game.  My earlier concerns are somewhat mitigated now that I see how to tie up the big guys by sending out a squad of little guys to engage them.

I was pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed this game -- I think I just might have to pick up a copy.  Edit:  I did pick up a copy.  Admittedly my reasoning was to use the terrain for D&D, but I own it nonetheless.  Now to get my partner to play!  Nyah!

Addendum: Can never have too much terrain!  I'd certainly be interested in more terrain... not so much the actual figures, as I already own them, but there you have it.

This is an AWESOME game that is a nice mix between random chance and strategy. This numerous expansions, various army picking, and custom design of the board create ENDLESS possibilities... the only 2 drawbacks with this game are sometimes bigger is better and smaller figures are wasted. The mentioned expansions can be a major money sucker too.

Well, this is toys for big boys. I happen to like tactical combat games, including this one. But for me, they're basically all the same: move your guys around to kill the other's guys, and try to reach the scenario goal first. 

The only real difference between a game like Heroscape and, say, ASL, is the amount of detail spent in trying to simulate (some kind of) reality.

So one one these games in my collection is enough. In my case, I kept BattleLore and sold this off.

HeroScape has a very clever physical design. It takes longer to set up than I'd like, but in most cases I'll be playing HeroScape with kids or casual gamers anyway, and they seem to enjoy the setup nearly as much as the play. The game itself is simplistic, and has a high random factor, but I have fun whenever I play it.

update - rating bumped up to 8.5. HeroScape has graduated from being merely something to do with the kids to something I enjoy for its own sake. There is no denying that it is a sinkhole for money and storage space, but getting more expansions opens the game up and creates more possibilities. The fact that the kids and non-gamers are easily sucked in is a huge bonus.

I bought this when I was volunteering as a Big Brother. Played it with my Little Brother all the time, and he loved it so we both have a great time.

You are never really faced with interesting choices, so the game drags a little.

Pre-painted plastic minis and a very modular playing board make this game very visually appealing for those who do not have the patience or finances for Games Workshop.  Like most head-to-head tabletop war games, most of the time, a game comes down to luck of the dice throws, but I enjoyed drafting an army by points, and responding to the units my opponent had drafted based on each character's stats and special abilities.
Also like many table top war games, the acquisition of additional armies is essential for having a varied experience, but because of the theme, there is no real need to specialize in one army.
I would only recommend this for people that are as interested in shaping the hexagon-based terrain for their battles (like Legos) as they are in the actual combat experience.

The "advanced" game is an ultra-simple, and fast-paced, wargame.  It's built around a solid, and tried-and-true, mechanic, and great components, which will attract the non-wargamer.  Too simple for me, personally, but it could have its place as a cross-over game to recruit new wargamers.

This game really surprised me.  When I initially read about it I didn't think it would appeal to me.  Then I found a copy while thrifting and gave it a shot.  Boy was I wrong!  This game is a LOT of fun.  The best way to describe it would be to say it is Final Fantasy Tactics on a much smaller scale.  If you like that PS game then you will LOVE HeroScape.  The game is the perfect blend of chrome, simple but effective rules, tactics/strategy, fun, and playtime.  My only gripe is that the setup time can be somewhat long.  Otherwise a really cool game!

[many plays] (rating is for the base game   any number of expansions.  Too many expansions for me to keep straight and rate individually). 
Pros: Great looking pieces, easy to learn, non-collectible.  Has a lot of variety to it and good replay value.  It has basic rules making it accessible to kids and advanced rules which give it a little more meat for adults.  
Cons: It just is so basic and non-original.  Each unit has x number of attack dice, y number of defense, z number movement and some special ability.  Each turn you move, you fight, you roll dice.  repeat repeat repeat.  
[update] After playing in an all day 6 round tournament, I concede this game has a lot more strategy then I had previously given it credit for.  It really does lend itself well to a tournament like that.  A Heroscape tournament is a lot of fun, and really I challenge anyone who participated in a good tournament to think that it just comes down to a bunch of dice rolling. Increasing my rating by .5.

A very competent game.  Play is fast, and there is no lost time while two sides slowly move their forces up to the middle - being able to put all 3 actions on one unit means that your Dragon can take the center ground on turn 1, or close to it.  Ranged combat isn't that overpowered, because figures can move at triple speed (see above) if necessary, and ranged attacks are underpowered enough that the HtH heroes will get in at least one good hit.

I love this game, its one of my all time favorites.  Overall it blows other miniatures games I've played out of the H20. Simple, but deep miniature war gaming (deep enough for me anyways).  Doesn't take itself too seriously.  Modular 3D terrain makes a huge difference.  Expandable, not collectible.  Some surprisingly nice pre-painted minis.  Great fanbase and support.  Is marred by poor product distribution and is annoyingly marketed to the wrong demographic.  Probably my biggest gripe is with some nefarious marketing tactics that force you to buy multiple expansions to get the most out of other units you've purchased.  It would be a near perfect game if not for this.   Still, this is one of my favorite games, and it has enormous untapped potential as a game system.

The best prepainted minis game I've seen*. Blows Clix games right out of the water. Has tactics, strategy, and army building, plays right out of the box. The constructable hex terrain is simply awesome. As for the figures... well, some of them are good, with inking and washing that prepaints usually don't have. Some of them kind of suck, but is still better than what else you could get at the same price. I will say it again: for what it is, it is THE BEST. 

Unfortunately the logistics involved in collecting, transporting and fielding so many plastic men keep this from being played more often, but that is a problem of the genre, not of the game. 

* As of 2009. Later on, Monsterpocalypse and X-Wing really showed me how a good minis game could do its thing while still not needing a big footprint. Let me tell you. That Heroscape terrain is pretty, but it is not worth the hassle.

Simple skirmish battle rules, yet not simplistic. The combination of the elegant order system and combat system, the mix of squads vs heroes, special powers that make the tactical decisions fun & interesting, a variety of soldiers from all time periods which oozes theme, and the inclusion of glyphs to add twists/objectives to the game, all result in a terrific game play experience. 

And for gamers who love "bits", the Rise of the Valkyrie set contains the best components of any game under $75 that I've ever found in my life. Simply astounding value for the money. This is the best of all the HeroScape master sets by far. 

There isn't a better skirmish game in a box. BRILLIANT!

You need to be of a certain personality type to enjoy this game.  If you really like the concept (a bazillion different types of soldiers fighting each other, Vikings versus WWII soldiers versus Robots versus Elves versus Everything else from history, science fiction, and fantasy), then you'll love it.  It's also easy enough that you can build a map and play a few times.  The modular terrain alone is a great playing point.

RATING: 2
Great 'toy', very very poor 'game'. No inkling of strategy just a competition to roll the best dice. For the purposes of the 'game' it would be just as engaging (which means 'not very') to do away with everything except the dice. It would not change the fundemental way the game plays. The only possible redeeming quality is that it may be a 'gateway' game for current non (or young) gamers who do not yet fully appreciate what a game can really be.

A great value, with strategy equal to any other minature game I've played before. Choosing the order of all of your actions before your turn is the best part of the game. However, the dice still can mess you over, but it's still good clean fun.

My son owns this game. First couple of playings went pretty well and was fun despite some aggravating die rolls. Heavy gamers beware: this is some light fun here, nothing too heavy or brainburning. Take the game for what it is and you will probably enjoy it.

A seemingly pretty perfect mix of light rules, accessibility and tactical depth. Of course, there's also a lot of luck here but that's rather expected in such a dice heavy game.

The sheer amount of terrain provided makes for a pretty varied and expandable game and offers a lot of variety.

In short, damn I'm impressed by this.

Our post-game summary was pretty much "I like that the rules are quick and simple and then get out of the way and allow you to just jump in and play".

This version has no box.

I bought my first copy at Essen 2004 for 65 EUR. I bought a second english set for 55 EUR because of the sparkly water and red & blue dice...

This game is very popular with the children I play it with. After the spectacular battle ends, they always want to play "free-format", i.e. building their own landscapes and armies and just use it as a toy.

One of our own scenarios with kids is to make a huge battlefield and dropping 5 treasures on it. They need to be gathered and are each worth a whopping 50 points. As soon as a figure hits the treasure, it is transported back to its starters zone (makes the rules really easy). Treasures include jewels (emerald and ruby) from Astoria, gold and pirate ships (to be placed on water tiles) from Age of Empires III, and of course flags on the castle walls...

RATING: 4
It can be fun, but the game tends to drag on.  And on.  And on.  You usually know who's going to win within forty-five minutes:  a game can last three hours or more with the expansions added.  Round limits are a necessity, and even then, Heroscape falls victim to a "rich get richer" problem.  A few bad rolls early in the game can cost you a few units.  Those few units can cost you access to glyphs, which do things like add one to your attack roll, and so on.  With those, of course, you lose a few more units, and the effects become insurmountable.  I have yet to see an army use superior strategy to overcome a larger force, simply because I don't think it's really possible given the ruleset.

That said, I will generally play, though I'm plagued with a conflict of interest:  my friend, who owns the game, likes to play with huge armies.  I would rather play skirmishes because, in a short game, the flaws of the system don't have time to emerge...

This game takes LITERALLY more time to setup than to play and win. Clunky game-play requires liberal use of house rules to streamline. Can be fun while playing, but I had this set, and purchased a set on eBay that had several expansions (over 200 figures and cards, castle pieces, tons of stuff), and it's a case of more is not always better. On average, setting up the board can take us close to 3-hours if done correctly to look mountainous, but we have over 1K pieces atm. And when we play, we'll leave the game up for days due to how long it took to setup and play several sessions, but everyone gets tired of it quickly. I recommend it for the figurines to use in other games, but I don't recommend the game itself!

A game beyond games.  I can't give it a 10 because it's just too fiddly to pull out frequently.  The plastic pieces for this game are so amazingly detailed, the endless variety of boards so fascinating in their 3D eccentricity, that you just gotta love this game.  Rules are straight-forward and self-apparent and it just has an atmosphere that is enjoyable.  I have a bunch of expansions and a whole crate of pieces, so I'll just say... I would play this any time.  

Only down-side.  Set up takes a while.  Yet, even setup is enjoyable.  With a new person to games, this game should be setup before they even arrive at your house.

Fun!  Lucky rolls can be too powerful.  Too much information for a new player to really have a chance (on account of all the units' abilities and synergies).  Takes either lots of time or lots of space to set up the map, so it doesn't get played often.  One day I'd really like to face an opponent who is heavily into the game to get more into drafting and the like.

Great minis game. The huge number of variations of armies make this a great game. Don't let the simple rules and game play fool you, this is fun and yes there is a bit of tactics involved.

Super fun game and huge $$$ sink. Though you don't have to throw a lot of money at this to have a good time, you really will want to.

I gave up tracking the expansion on the geek - I only record plays here and I keep track of my ownings for my own records, not for the geek. There is no point in rating the waves as a whole in my mind.

The game is just beautiful and a lot of fun to look at.  The terrain is awesome and squad movement is really fun.  I could only imagine the game getting more awesome as you pick up more sets.

We played one game with the Marvel Superheroes and I didn't enjoy it as much.  They are just too strong and it feels like less of a skirmish game at that point, especially since you can just move the one hero 3 times and never move anyone else.  

Great game, but the downside is the amount of time and space required to play.  It's way too big for my collection, but I'd be happy to play anytime (especially if I don't have to set it up).

Good game if you can find a good scenario to play. Simple "kill all enemies" goals get boring quickly.

I'd compare this game to Star Wars - Epic Duels.  Except you don't have cards to battle with. While I certainly wouldn't call this game overrated, I don't see why it should be so much better in comparison to the referred game. 

1. The amount of luck is the same. With the difference, that luck or misfortune in SWED blasts you or the opponent away within 15 minutes gaming time. Whereas in this game, you'll be by far more frustrated, when misfortune hits you after an hour and a half.
2. Speaking of imbalance: As in SWED there are more and less powerful charakters. With the exception that from some of the "should-be-powerfuls" you get less than what you hoped for. (Speaking of the basic set only)   

Don't get me wrong here! I like this game, it's fun, it looks sweet, but I'd vote for SWED over this one anytime.

I first looked into the game because I was interested in the figures, but after buying the Master Set and reading through the rules it intrigued me enough to play a few games with my son. After a couple of "simple" games and a few "advanced" games, I found the gameplay easy enough for younger kids and interesting enough for the older ones. The only drawback I had was the amount of time it took to set the board up.

5 TO 9!  I'd rate HS all the way as low as 5, and all the way up to 9.  There are all kinds of reasons for both, but it really is a twisting, confusing series of thoughts that I have on this game.  For awhile, it was all I thought about, gaming-wise.  I scoured stores everywhere for specific boosters, driving my poor kids with me (Dad, why are we in K-Mart again?  We never go there, except with you....).  But then, I hit the set-up wall.  And I think I nearly killed it with all the stuff I gathered.  3 masters sets, 1 Marro master set, and tons of boosters.  And to pull it out and set up a game is rough enough.  But then, there is the draft.  I suppose I could go and simply cull out 1 master set for quick games, but man, that seems like a lot of work.  

Bins and tubs and boxes.....

But still, I love it.

Great value for the money. Very cool terrain, combat system is only ok. House rules+ expansions+info from BGG will probably cause this rating to rise.Not as much game as PR or POF. I own 4 so I can get a huge board. After owning this for awhile, I find the number of plays dropping fairly rapidly. It is still a great display though for when I do game demos in schools, or in introducing younger kids ( boys) to gaming. Girls perfer to start with something like Ticket To Ride.

HeroScape is in an odd position for me. It promises great amounts of fun, and for the most part, delivers.

I only have a couple of issues with it. For one, set up time (including terrain) is *very* long. And second, the sheer amount of stuff to buy is incredible.

Both of these issues, admittably, are my own problems. The first can be solved with more space to leave the game up, and the second is only a problem if, like me, you have a "gotta have it all" mentality.

Good game, but I'd much rather pull out a smaller box that's easier to setup and is still great fun.

RATING: 10
Dec, 09: Great fun, but setup time keeps it off the table as much as it could be.  Wish I had space to leave big built maps setup for days so as to enable quicker play sooner.

Jan, 14:  After four years, I have to bump this up to a ten.  Even though it can be a challenge to get on the table, every single game is nail biting, cheer out loud, palm sweating, fist-pumping fun.  Damn I wish I would have bought more stuff when I had the chance.

Love this game, I own nearly everything for it and 2 base sets.  There's almost a lego building quality to making the map.  Then it's almost like you're playing pretend with a dragon fighting a giant robot who's fighting WW2 airborne troops.  It's easy to play and surprisingly balanced.  Went out of print too soon.  If you want an in-print version, check out Magic the gathering: Arena for basically the same game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Letter Grade: A-.   

Snap judgment: 9.  It's a grand, huge system of a game.  If you assume drafting is a part of the game it adds quite a bit to your tactical considerations.  But once you get stuck into the fighting, the skirmishes are quick and light and fun.  It has a great sense of scale for the playing time.  Only a couple expansions gives you a staggering amount of replay value.  It seems like this game will give back exactly what you want to put into it.  

[05-08-09]: Old Rating: 9.  New rating: 8.  HeroScape is a game that I am obsessed with in bursts.  If I'm not playing it, I'm REALLY not playing it, but if I am, it's all I can think about.  Part of it is the set-up, the hauling out of the parts and construction of the board.  Part of it is the collectibility of it, which is (for my mentality) a blessing AND a curse.  If I had a permanent place to leave this up I'd rate it higher. It's a lifestyle game.

Very cool. Played this twice in one night and it's a perfect reminder for me that games don't need to be deep or complicated to be enjoyable. This is definitely loose and light and best enjoyed for giggles. I was tempted to rate this game an 8, but I'm just not certain that it'll have suitable replayability to hit that mark. After a few more plays, though, if it holds up well my rating could likely go up.

And when MB overstocks store shelves and this gets discounted like crazy I'll probably buy some myself.

I guess its customization is its biggest strength. They give you bits and say "Hey design your own game, this is the combat resolution"  Meh.  Too long for what it is.  Give me something shorter that doesn't have all the false strategy pretense.  Meh... good for "bits people" pass if you are a "game mechanism person".  Every game I've ever played has a similar flavor.  It loses my interest right about the time of the third combat.

I finally tried HeroScape for the first time this year as a few friends started getting very into the game and buying the game and many expansions. So my first experience was not only with the base game, but with around 10 expansions thrown into the mix as well. It's handy to have friends that are so into the game because they can take care of the laborious setup before you even arrive, since preparing the map for battle sounds like it takes as long as the battle itself (which reminds me of a series of games about tanks, elephants, and goblins). Unlike that series though, HeroScape was really fun. Sure it primarily revolved around rolling gobs of dice and sure it was essentially playing with little plastic army men, which may explain the appeal in great part due to the nostalgia factor for a long-gone youth spent in large part making up rules for grand army men warfare. But despite all that, or more likely because of all that, it's simply fun. I was actually struck by how much more complex the game is than I had anticipated. The base rules themselves are quite simple, but when you throw all of the many units' special powers into the mix, it becomes a lot to keep track of. We played four-player games divided into two teams of two players each, which I think was a great way to structure the battle. Being a long-time fan of team games, from Nexus Ops to Ingenious to Crokinole, I particularly enjoyed the team game elements of HeroScape when played this way. I found the three-player free-for-all to suffer from the same issue as discussed above regarding End of the Triumvirate and Through the Ages. HeroScape doesn't seem like a game I'm going to start purchasing any time soon, given the space it takes to store and the setup time, but it's one I'll be happy to play, especially if we play a team game and someone else sets up the map.

I will put this comment for all of my HS stuff

Simply Awsome - Nice durable pieces, endless map possibilities that are only limited by your imagination.  Basic or advanced game play rules (even the advanced rules are easy to grasp, quite frankly my 11yr old son never liked the "Basic" rules)
You can play the game with one master set but that won't last long, so this game can get expensive if you get carried away (like most players of this game have)  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A game that appeals to the kid in all of us.  The 3D board, cool "Valhalla" theme, and diverse characters are just a few reasons to play this awesome game.  I love how all of the information is provided at a glance, and the "draft" style of play seems like it will keep things fresh for a long time to come.

As an added bonus, the game is screaming for customization, since basically any miniature can be inserted with ease.

I've played several HeroScape games with friends' preconstructed armies and terrains, and I really enjoy the fighting system.

Rise of the Valkyrie

Grass, Rock, Sand, Water (Dice and game components)

Mimring, Finn, Thorgrim, Tarn, Agent Carr, Krav Maga Agents, Ne-Gok-Sa, Marro Warriors, Syvarris, Deathwalker 9000, Zettian Guards, Raelin, Izumi Samurai, Sgt. Drake Alexander, Airborn Elite, Grimnak

I have 3 sets of 1st edition (sparkly water) and 4 sets of 2nd edition, plus extra terrain only from ebay. I use only 1 of each figure.

Heroscape is a favorite game of mine, I started collecting Heroscape right after Wave 3 was released (introduced by Craig van Ness at Unity Games 9), and I now have every piece produced, including all promotional figures, duplicates of all commons and terrain sets.  I like to attend heroscape events, especially tournaments. Army construction is key, and how figures interact on a team is most important. You learn by doing, and finding out how powerfully some figures work together turns up some real surprises!

I sold one unopened set on ebay in Dec. 2013 for $175.00

While the set up takes forever, it is worth it, and the game is very fun. There is about a hundred of different Characters, some of which are either hero's or squads. Very in depth war game that I enjoy very much. One of my favorites.

RATING: 8.8
Though one of those games with MANY expansions (and thus in the end, its storage system costs more than some games).... it is a GREAT game.  

If you like Lego, can't paint, but love painted miniatures, this game will scratch that itch.

It may seem like it is a simple skirmish game (and it is), but the advanced rules add synergies and depth that make this game interesting.

My son's first favourite game at one point, having since given way to Star Wars Queen's Gambit, Epic Duels, Blue Moon and others. He still wants to play it occassionally, and I'm all for any game he likes. 

In addition, I have to admit to being pleasantly surprised by it. For a long time, I avoided purchasing it because the idea of WWII soldiers fighting alongside, or against, dragons and robots really bothered me. It turned out that the fun factor, helped by simple rules, made up for it. I would have loved to see dedicated sets of this, like Romans against Carthaginians, avoiding the weird stuff, but it's still a good product.

Fast, fun, fantasy, non-collectable, miniatures game.  Simple enough for the young ones, but interesting enough to keep me entertained.  Besides, any game where you can have a Tyranasaurus Rex with an orc on his back bite a WWII soldier in half has to be worth trying once.

Fun game with a design that achieves what it sets out to do perfectly, including the add-ons that will mean steady money for good 'ol Hasbro for quite a while.

Should add a lot of depth to an already great game.

I've had a lot of fun playing this game. The terrain is excellent and gives the game a 3D element. Very tactical, but not as strategic as a germanic game. I much prefer this to Duel of Ages. Maybe I'm a sucker for the components, but this game is way more fun to me.

RATING: 8
The rating is based on playing the Basic Game and my understanding of the Master Game rules, so the rating may change as I play it more. The game is tactical enough to keep my interest as an avid wargamer while still being easy enough to explain and understand the rules for 8-10 year olds. I imagine that against experienced wargamers, this will be a blast.

Good miniatures, fantastic tilesystem. But the game...I don't know. Even the master game is a no-brainer that is really most suitable for children. In that respect it is really comparable to Space Crusade: Nice to play every now and then as an atmospheric dicefest.
* UPDATE: As I expected, the basic game is much more suitable for children than it is for adults. My 6-year old son loves it!
* UPDATE(2): Now that my son has turned 7 and is able to play the master game, I am really starting to appreciate HeroScape. Especially with the great scenarios found here on BGG, which do require some tactical decisions. After buying a second master set, I am now ready for some expansions :-p.
* UPDATE(3): I am sold. Now that I own quite a lot of minis, picking one's army is quite a strategic affair. Also, it can be really interesting to see how a battle turns out.

RATING: 8
I finally succumbed to curiousity after years of hearing about this game, and I'm glad I did. This is in no way a serious miniatures wargame, but it allows for quite a range of play styles. It can be simple enough to play with children, or deep enough to occupy a couple of gaming adults for a long afternoon of building, planning, drafting, and playing. And it certainly looks great on the table and has a ton of production value for the cost.

The only reason I wouldn't rate this a 10 is that there's not *quite* enough in the Master Set to entertain serious gamers for more than a few plays. You don't need everything in the Heroscape line to have a great game, but you need more than this. In particular, the lack of common squads and bonding leaves out a big gameplay element. However, for the price ($30-$40 usually), this is still an unbeatable value.

Update 5/08: Dropped to an 8. My enthusiasm has dimmed somewhat, though I still expect to get plenty more games in.

If you are remotely interested in the theme or in miniatures, this is by far the best bang for your time and money you could ever hope for. Always fun, it can be played strategically or without a thought or care about winning and still be fun.

RATING: 7.5
A nice tactical skirmish, with undoubtedly the best bits in my collection. There is a bit of strategy to the game, but it's not the heaviest game, although that makes it very easy to teach.

I have still not played a large map, but if you want lots of replayability, you will need some expansions, particularly some terrain.

The only "lacking" expansion for HeroScape in my mind was the Marvel edition.  Prepainted minis, hundreds of abilities and build-your-own-map with hex based tiles, HeroScape is one of the best strategic games available.

A surprise!  Didn't expect too much from this game, but it's a really slick, easy-to pick up miniatures system.  I've only played with a friend's collection, and he has tons of everything Heroscape, so I got to play with some expansion stuff, and thus I'm a bit biased.  But definitely this is something I can get behind in a miniatures game.  Nice and simple, easy to get into, easy to teach, and still contains stragetic and tactical depth.  The order system is a touch of genius.

One of the best and most addicting games I have played. Accessible to even
beginning players, and yet the special attacks and powers add much depth to
strategy. Miniatures-light, a great intro for people who would be put off
by the complexity (i.e. 100  page rulebooks) of most historical and fantasy miniatures. Rules are very well written, and components, especially the hex terrain, are very nice.

I want to like this game more than I do...  It seems to be bits over substance for me.  But I AM a sucker for good bits and the minis and modular scenery are awesome.

This Fantasy Battle Board Game comes with dozens of painted plastic miniatures, each representing a warrior from a different era, and hex-based hard plastic terrain pieces which can be put together in many different ways. The warriors include 30 plastic figures, including World War II soldiers, futuristic robots, aliens, a T-Rex-riding orc, a large dragon, and many more. Each hero or squad has its own card that details both movement and combat abilities.
\13\\13\
The rulebook features two games: a basic and a master version. In the basic version (designed for younger players less than 8 years of age), characters move, attack, defend, and have range -- but there are no special powers and some other rules are minimized and/or eliminated. The master game includes special powers, wounds, engagement rules, falling rules, and a few other additions.
\13\\13\
Combat in the game is fairly straightforward. You roll attack dice as listed on your unit's card (1 to 8 dice in the Master Set), and the opponent rolls defense dice equal to the number on their unit's card (1 to 9 dice). Skulls rolled in excess of shields count as wounds (hero figures may have more than one Life).

RATING: 7
Pre-painted minis! Constructable Terrain! Non-collectible! (At least in theory; good luck finding wave one without paying through the nose, but I digress...)

Heroscape is one of those wonderful phenomenons that only comes around every decade or so. Put simply, it's a toy for seven year-olds that is purchased and played with exclusively by thirty year-olds. The terrain is great for wargaming, the miniatures are great for roleplaying, and the rulebook packs a pretty solid game as well.

On the flip side, the small size of most of the tiles (only one or two hexes) makes set-up and take down a chore. Ironic, since building your own battlefield is one of the main selling points of the game! The stat cards are another odd bit of irritation. Why they didn't use a standard card size for sleeving is beyond me. The cards (especially ones packed in later expansion boosters) are awkward, flimsy, and take up way too much real estate.

Everything else about the game is pure unadulterated fun. Movement is simple and intuitive. Combat is a breeze and packs plenty of excitement. Army building is engaging and drafting is even better. The figures all have different special powers that muck with the game's mechanics, yet everything seems to stay pretty well balanced. As my good friend Zxqueb likes to say, "Heroscape achieves it's tremendous gameplay balance by making everything broken".

Runes are the only "iffy" mechanic in the game. They seem to be tacked on and actually do a fairly good job of unbalancing things. Do yourself a favor, and pretend they don't exist...

The kids and I love Heroscape. It's simple enough for a seven year-old to grasp, yet offers enough depth to be played with the grown-ups. Set-up time is a big issue, especially if you can't leave it up for a couple of days after building it. This is certainly a game which functions better if a whole afternoon is set aside for it. Although individual battles usually take less than an hour to play, you will want to battle it out a few more times after spending an hour or so setting up. Army drafting is quick and easy, so there will be very little down time between games. Now go bash face!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
My 7 rating doesn't convey how disappointed I was in this game. I really wanted to love it, for it to be something my son and I could get into someday with the custom units and whatnot. But it's just too long for what it is. Pretty much everything I like about this game is done in Memoir '44, and that game plays twice as quickly and takes half the time to set up. That said, there are some good things about it, and I'm sure if I cared to I could find or make some scenarios I like as much as C&C...but I didn't enjoy it enough to put in that effort.

I rate this game so highly not just because it plays well, but because the plastic hex board is the best design I have ever seen for a changeable board. It is FANTASTIC! I bought 5 games and bought 3 extra water tile bags on Ebay to create some huge water maps. This game will be talked about for years as a kind of classic.

Fun, simple miniatures game with very creative terrain, however, it needs more advanced rules to be a great minis game.  HeroScape's greatest asset is its cool 3-dimensional terrain.  This is also its greatest drawback as it lacks portability and takes a while to set up a battlefield.

For the unindoctrinated, Heroscape is basically a very simple miniatures war game with 3D terrain, pre-painted minis, no blind boosters, and a universe that draws on warriors from all of history.  The system is dice-heavy, but still allows for plenty of strategy.  Also, it is totally awesome.  

I've read some complaints about the lack of coherent theme, but that, for me, is part of what makes Heroscape so cool.  What's more fun than building an army of robots, Celts and cowboys to take on a dragon, FBI agents and ninjas?  Nothing, I say, nothing!

My Heroscape collection is much smaller than many that are really into it (I have about half of the characters that have been released, one of each master set, and a couple terrain packs).  For a while this bugged me to death, and I [i]had[/i] to get the rest but lacked the money to do so.  I'm pretty much over it now and am happy to play with what I do have, but be aware that despite the fact that it's not "collectable" doesn't mean that you may not get the collect-it-all bug just the same...

For a brief comparison of the two master sets, see my comment for the Swarm of the Marro.

No trees were killed in the production of this game (maybe a few shrubs).  Lots of value in the box plus a simple and advanced method of playing.  A non-CCG version of clix games without the clix.  A diamond in the rough.  The 3D value of the terrain alone makes the game worth it but there's plenty of game fun to be had as well.  And best of all, my wife likes it.  My original rating was 9.1 but I've upped my rating on the game by an extra 0.5 out of awe for her interest in it.

My first BGG hype buy.  I had just found BGG and everyone was talking about this game coming out.  I totally bought into and talked a number of friends into this game.  They have gotten Way into it.  This is another game I like enough, but I really don't "love" it.  The theme is too all over the place for me.  And the game is so simple I don't feel like I really have any meaningful strategies.  I probably have the wrong expectations about this game, or I'm playing with the wrong people.

Base Heroscape game.  The game wasn't very fun for an experience game player with the basic rules, but even with the advanced rules it's not as sophisticated as Warhammer 40K or any of the miniatures games.  That being said I'm not interested in painting 100's of figurines, so I really like that Heroscape figures come prepainted.  I'd probably play this one more if it didn't take so long to setup and didn't take up so much space with all the expansions.  Just the same it fills that niche when you just want to kill things and don't want a sophisticated game.

How is this possible?  A mass-marketable miniatures game?  Well, it is, and it works.  The rules are simplistic but deep enough to give strategic value to both army drafting and clever play.  The game components are simply amazing (great sculpt/paint jobs on the 30 prepainted miniatures, over 70 interlocking plastic terrain hexes, and tons of nice counters, dice, and other goodies).  The only reason I didn't give this one a 10 is the minor balance issues between some of the units (the unit costs are out-of-whack, which can make for unbalanced armies of the same point totals).  Definitely worth trying out, and it's something you can probably even get your non-gamer friends to play.

I've been curious about this game for quite awhile, but only decided to buy it after reading the comments on BGG.  (And I found it on sale.)

I was surprised at how cool this simple miniatures combat game is.  I thought it might be too light to be more than a filler, but it looks great, plays great (I was especially surprised with how quickly strategy comes into play, making use of terrain, etc.), and is extremely simple to teach others.

This game is great.  I love just about everything about it.  The only reason it is not a 10 is because I am less enthusiastic about it now that I no longer have nearby friends familiar with the game.  The guys I play it with now understand the game, but do not know all the figures, which makes it somewhat less fun.  There have been few better games made.

HeroScape is almost as much a toy as it is a game.     Players build a landscape out of plastic hexes, select teams of warriors, and do battle by moving the warrior figures around and rolling lots of dice.  Good quality components, painted figures, and very popular with my boys.

My favorite board game. Easily one of the coolest games I've ever seen or played. No other game gives you such cool toys, simple rules, and a wonderfully deep amount of strategy. How else could a game that uses so many dice still end up being all about skill once you're not a beginner at the game?

RATING: 9.5
Although my friends and I eventually grew tired of this, we played it every other week for about three years.  Thus, the 9.5 rating.

I've got an extra I'd be willing to trade (including a first editon with shiny water.

I got quickly addicted to this game after I first tried it. With rules simple enough for anyone to understand within a couple of minutes and Lego-like hex building, it is just so difficult to resist getting more and more. And you get to play with orcs riding dinosaurs! Orcs. Riding. Dinosaurs.

Great value for the money, just wish I could buy the terrain seperately. Pretty light, but quite a bit of fun. Making maps and scenarios is quite a bit of fun as well.  The new figures add tons to the game.

We also have a nearly countless variety of expansions to Heroscape, (cards, characters and custom game enhancements). An extreamly accessable and fun game of conflict.

Light game system with interesting bits. Great fun especially because it's easy to make your own house rules and campaigns. It's almost as much fun to build and design a game event as playing.

Nice minis and terrain, had the expansions but didn't think that added a lot. Fun to pull out and play every now and then, only thing I don't like is setting up and then having to break it down.

RATING: 7.9
Only had a few games but I am really liking this. The dice chucking aspect can be a bit of a let-down due to major luck swings but playing a number of games averages it out a bit better. That is my only gripe however as I think it's visually awesome and a lot of fun to boot.
It's probably a great way of getting new people into the genre too but unfortunately, short of buying from Ebay and the likes, it is pretty scarce and/or prohibitively expensive.

The rating is for playing this with my 6-(and then 7 and then 8)-year-old son .  It's not something that I would pull out to play with my gaming buddies.  Even with the advanced rules, my son plays this easily, and it's fun for both of us.

RATING: 7
Works great on several levels.  The bits are great for my youngest child to just play with and have a good ol' time.  The system allows for a lego type put it togther experience and the game system makes for a good simple war game.  The variety and flexibility of the system makes for great replayability.  It is great that the expansions are not "collectable".  You know exactly what you get when you buy.  On the downside, it is a money pit if you are inclined to expand your collection.  Many of the expansions are out of print and expensive.

Try as I might I can't get into enjoying light "dice heavy" combat systems (and I enjoy dice math). the activation tricks are fun, but not enough.  I guess if I want to throw dice I prefer Titan.

The game I wish I had as a kid.  I love the miniatures, the terrain and the tactical battles. I'm just a bit tired of the immense setup time and the tendency to overuse a few powerful units allowing other units to be attacked with impunity.  Some sort of battle back would be nice hey. Still the steady stream of expansions and the huge fun factor keep me coming back for more.

This is one of the more fun miniature figure games I have played. I have amassed quite a collection of figures and terrain and while it is a lot of hard work and very time consuming to build amazing maps it is so worth it in the end.

RATING: 6
Easy to learn rules but complex relationships between units and heroes. Lots of replay value in unit combinations and endless terrain.

I ultimately got out of this because it demands a lot of table time, especially when you go all out and buy buy buy like I did. Would be an excellent game to play 5+ times a week.

Just don't have the time to invest in it. Spent way too much cash on it anyway.

RATING: 5
I don't really play this one anymore.  ...and frankly, when I did play with my son he was a lot younger.  I keep it around though because I really love the hex terrain building tiles and castle parts of the expansions.  Just takes a half-day to build a big map with castles on each side.

This is pretty much my only miniatures game.  It has an extremely high toy factor.  But it also is a really good tactical game.  There is a hugerific internet community based around the game to provide idea, enhancements & scenarios.  The expansions got to expensive for how little it is used.  But it's still fun to play with.  Maybe it will see more use when (if) I have grandchildren.

RATING: 7.5
This is the game that really solidified wanting to host board game nights and having people come over to play games for hours on end. This is the BEST table top game out there, period (SUCK IT 40K and HEROCLIX). The minis weren't random (blind), they were pre-painted, you build any map you want and its 3D, you can draft an army consisting of any genre you want, and you can have any win stipulations you want. You want co-op, you got it, free-for-all? DONE, area control? I gotchu. What's that? You want a campaign, easy peezy lemon squeezy. It is a crime, A CRIME!! that this game was discontinued. Shame on Wizards of the Coast for dropping the ball on something that I would STILL be purchasing today if they were still making it :angry:

Fantastic stuff for MB, mass-produced gaming. Lots of plastic for your money. Easy to learn, with little rule problems in sight. Not as strategic as "harder" wargames, but that can change with the right scenario and future expansions. Still great fun anyway. The length of set-up (putting the board together) averaging 12-15 minutes keeps me from breaking it out ALL the time. But every couple of weeks is cool by me.

RATING: 6.5
I was stoked about Heroscape because I had got out of miniatures gaming years before, but this seemed to make it more "boardgamey" and everything looked great...a friend picked up a copy and I did enjoy playing it, I just can't bring myself to start collecting all those little figures again...but I'll play it

RATING: 8
This game is indeed close to perfection for what you get -- and what you get is a very simple game with incredible bits. Stellar components, incredibly modular terrain system, simple and clear rules. Very high replay value, ver high fun factor. Holds lots of attraction to a wide gamer base. The lack of real meat to the gameplay itself keeps it from reaching higher.

Ah, Heroscape. The battle system's nothing special, but the flavour's amusing (if daft), the build quality excellent, the modular board entertaining and the simplicity makes it open to players of all levels.

Very amusing, if limited - the mechanics earn it a five, but the production values and Lego-like appeal take this up a notch. So. Pretty.

This game fulfills some basic needs for me.  1.The need to collect.  2.The desire to build.  3.The thrill of customizing.  It's easy to teach, and very tactical even though its also a massive dicefest.  One of the biggest flaws is that its not very portable.  Its an expensive game, and there are a few items that are just going to be tough to get.

The Build & Battle system of Heroscape was a wonderful idea and really allowed players to have the ultimate battles of all time.

I don't have anything bad to say about the game. Just keep in mind that it requires alot of space for playing and storing.

It's too bad it was discontinued, I've felt the game had some unlocked potential still.

When I was a youngin' I picked up this funky looking game called Axis and Allies.  My friends and I had a blast for years, along with all the other Gamemaster games.  I think Heroscape is similar in effort and result for the current generation.  It's a wonderful entry point to the world of boardgaming in general, and wargaming in particular.  My 11 year old son loves it, and even my wife will play.  Only negative is price; the game really doesn't become great until you get into the expansions.  However, the base game is entertaining, and I heartily recommend this title to anyone. You really must be jaded not to like this game.

Tiny Epic Galaxies: Satellites & Super Weapons Mini Expansion (2015)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Rating based on one play with 4 players.
Game length nearly 2 hours. I wouldn't play this again with four and never with 5 players. Far too long for a dice/luck game.
I'd try again with 3. Maybe solo is fun. But many, many better games to play with 2 or 4.
Surprisingly thinky though.
I won by the way.

Un juego entre filler y algo más, de elegir acciones con las caras en las tiradas de dados, cierta gestión de recuros y avances de tus naves, con un toque de interacción curioso, ya que puedes imitar las acciones de otros jugadores. Sistema de puntuación correcto, si bien me parece que las cartas de 7 puntos están demasiado subidas para lo que es el resto de juego (con 2 de ellas tienes ya casi la partida cerrada...) Pero un juego pequeño y muy entretenido, de los que salen fácil a mesa.

RATING: 6
This is a game that easy to enjoy with not too many rules and relatively fast game play. Rolling dice and assigning them to take actions is simply fun. Actually, Tiny Epic Galaxies might be one of the more enjoyable civilization dice games, for a time at least.

I do fear that after a few plays the game starts to repeat itself too much, since basically all what you do is that you try to create a situation in which all dice are beneficial to you, no matter what you roll. Moreover, you always want to keep some culture in your pocket to make sure you can follow other players in crucial moves. Another thing that might prove repetitive in the long term, is how you win the game. You absolutely must conquer planets, and to conquer planets you need the right rolls. I was a bit disappointed that alternative ways to gain points were rather limited. In practice, all this emphasises the one-dimensionality of winning strategies. In the end, Tiny Epic Galaxies boils down to straightforward racing.

I would have liked to see the special actions the planets have to contribute more to the scoring so that you could form completely new strategies on the basis of what is available. Now the planets just provided the major way way to score points with occasional little twists, tiny boosts, or ways to mitigate bad rolls a bit.

Mechanically, the game is solid. The only minor "bad" thing is the follow mechanic which slows the game down a bit too much in my opinion. After assigning a die, you have to go around the table asking whether the other players will pass or follow. This is rather frustrating.

Anyways, Tiny Epic Galaxies is not a bad game, it just could have been so much more.

Kickstarted.

Absolutely amazing game. At first I thought some planet abilities were over powered and that some would be never used. Now I've played 20 odd games, I've realised how to get the best from what's in front of you whilst considering resources, abilities and victory points. I've used some cards less but when I've used them, I really needed them! Even if it did only give me one energy, it means I can use that energy to pay another player to use their colonised ability, which wins me the game! 

The satellites expansion add a nice twist to the game. Generally I keep the satellites for vps BUT the abilities are used when necessary. All about using them at the right time. You can get a quick/easy 2 vps from them too if you think that's all you need to edge your opponents.

My first 'learning game' was well over an hour and I was worried it would always be a long game BUT now it only takes us 30-40 mins which is great! 

Components are of a high quality and art work is amazing. I made my own start piece out of fools gold which looks awesome! The game doesn't include a start player piece which was a bit weird...

By far one of my favourite games.

Quick, fun little space game. Players are vying for control over planets (without violence), and be the first to 21 points. Dice rolling is always fun, and several ways to mitigate rolls and 'following' other players makes it very strategic. Downtime is still there, but only if you're not expecting to follow other players.

In Tiny Epic Galaxies each player controls a galactic empire, aiming to expand their influence by acquiring highly contested planets and increasing their cosmic armada. The game revolves around an innovative dice-rolling combo mechanic. The number of dice you roll is determined by the strength of your galaxy. Each die is engraved with symbols representing the various actions you can take, such as moving a spaceship, increasing your culture or energy resources, or advancing your political or economic influence over newly discovered planets.

It's good, but not great? I don't know. Doesn't feel like too much there. I like the ability to follow. And the game feels connected to Roll for the Galaxy, (for sure thematically) but also in a weird way mechanically, even if they don't really share mechanics... I don't know if that makes sense.

An immense game in a tiny package.  Really love TEG.  

There is a lot of strategy in how you use your dice and the ability to follow another player's action eliminates downtime and keeps everyone involved the whole time.

Yes, it can be a bit annoying if you suffer a run of bad dice rolls (although there are some options to mitigate this) or lack enough Civilisation to follow other players but the satisfaction of pulling off a great combo from following another player's action is brilliant.

I'd played Tiny Epic Kingdoms, which I found to be inoffensive but mediocre, so I wasn't expecting much. This game is loads better than that. Reacting to other people's actions is what turns this from a mediocre game into a good one. It's well worth the investment.

Supposedly a 4X game but lacks any sort of 4X feel. Explore is almost non-existent and exterminate is not even a thing in this one so I don't get the whole claim to be a 4X game.

Competent as a game.  The dice-action-selection mechanic is well-done; rerolls give player agency, and there's usually SOMETHING you can spend your dice on.  The randomness from the dice, the random planet draw, and the hidden objectives all keep the game from becoming particularly solvable.

My problem with the game is just... none of the decisions are particularly compelling.  It feels like an optimization puzzle.

I'm particularly impressed that the game fits in such a small box and yet works so well as a game, despite the size.

I like this quite a lot, so much so that I can't imagine wanting to play Eminent Domain, Roll for the Galaxy, Race for the Galaxy, Impulse or Hegemonic over it (though I will likely keep some of those in my collection). Simple intuitive game of rolling dice, assigning actions, moving your pieces up tracks (similar to its sibling Tiny Epic Kingdoms), with beautiful elegance, nice artwork, and a good variety of balance and powers to the planets you acquire that will bolster your abilities. Cannot wait for the expansion to this, it's a winner.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
This is certainly pleasant enough, and I think many of the compact design choices in the game are clever and intuitive. More depth to it would benefit the game greatly.

Impulse packs a bigger punch in a small box as well, but this game is less obtuse to learn at the price of being more simplistic.

Worth it.

Despite the worker placement and resource collecting aspects of the game this is primarily a dice game which I'm sure will turn some people off.

Fun game that I am glad to own, the motions that you go through are engaging and very entertaining. Picking where to place your attentions for more power or easy pickings is good fun. Die rolling is at its best here: you have the option to sacrifice two useless ones for ONE that you MUST get every turn. You can "follow" actions of other players so continue to plan during your turn. The amount of in your face is light enough to remind one they are in a conflict, but seamless enough to ignore until the right moment to strike. The amount of content in the game is also of high value; planet cards especially the meat of the game essentially, can be added and changed/modified in future releases whether POD or outright expansion, to almost no end, this is a good thing. The rest of the components are also of high caliber, plastic would have sufficed, heck the game is playable with cardboard, yet there is wood here on tap for all of the payer pieces, this too can be augmented very easily by home brewers or the devs at any time to virtually any number, fantastic! Speaking of card stock, those planet cards are some of the finest thickest cards I have seen in some time most welcome, the central play board and player boards are all very well done as well, not as thick, but certainly not the bottom of the barrel in terms of quality. Highly recommended for light fun with a decent strategic twist, and I look forward to more plays and more content in this fine system.

Somewhat more inviting than Tiny Epic Kingdoms but as boring and unoriginal, Tiny Epic Galaxies still looks like a filler and plays like a heavier game: it's way too demanding for the "tiny" game it should (and claims to) be.

Anyhow, I was inclined to rate this game better than Kingdoms thanks to its science fiction theme but in the end it feels even more pasted on here than Kingdom's does.

Initial Impressions:
---------------------
This is the best of the 3 that I have played (this, Tiny Epic Kingdom, Tiny Epic Defenders), but it still felt bland.  I think this one is better at the 2-3p count, and probably won't be very interested in playing 4p again.  The micro game thing was a fad, and I think if this had come out a few years earlier, it would of been much more interesting.  Not a bad game, but nothing to get excited about either.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I know it says 30 minutes on the box but our first play-through took more than 2 hours! I really hope this speeds up with experience, even though some members of my game group are prone to over-analyzing every move. 

I really appreciate this game and what it sets out to accomplish. My girlfriend, however, called it boring and quit playing after about 15 minutes. This won't be for everyone, then. 

I'm hoping the 'Satellites & Superweapons' mini expansion might inject a little bit of life into this game once it arrives from BBG. EDIT: No, it doesn't.

I like the mix of worker Placement and tactic. The rules are simple but each turn is a challenge to get the best out of it. The System for solo Play is perfect, the game is hard to beat on harder 3 Levels (other 2 are easy). Even that dice are in Play, you do not depend on luck all the time. It is more tactic than luck.

Great game that plays quickly and is about getting the most points, but you have to be careful about the bonus points because that can be the swing that gets you the victory.  The mechanic of rerolling is good to help mitigate bad rolls and the follow mechanic makes it so you are engaged on other people's turns.  Definitely a keeper and I can't wait to play with the additional kickstarter extras

Great game. Great...small...game. Tiny Epic really fits the game.
The first reaction when you lay out the components is "Hmm that's all? That is not much..."
After the first rounds that changes to "Ohkay, that is more than it looks like."
And finally you reach "Damn, that truly is epic...and tiny."

Great game. Plays pretty fast, offers a lot of depth, introduces some nice mechanics, looks great and much more that I forgot to mention.
Tiny Epic Galaxies offers a really great game in such a small box...and delivers more game than some other normal or big box games.

This would probably be a 9 if I played it correctly but instead I make the last die the only one to copy. Picks up the pace and simplifies strategy for newbies. However, if everyone is very familiar with the game, playing as it should be is not too slow and is great. I also rate it highly for the solo play aspect and ability to shove in my handbag.

The best of the "Tiny Epic" games, by a large margin. Powers combo in really fun ways, the puzzle of figuring out how to use (and manipulate) your dice is interesting, leveling up is a cool additional consideration, and competition over the planets can be fierce. The only thing I'm not a big fan of in this (or any) Euro game is "the race-to-points" element, which takes away some of the end-game drama: whoever wins first (usually) wins.

A really good dice rolling game which has two great innovations:

1) The game isn't simply roll/reroll/reroll, which has been done to death.  Rerolling requires energy, which is a resource you must gather, and you also need energy for other things, which makes you have to earn your rerolls.

2) There is a resource called culture which you can use to follow anyone else's action.  It's great to be involved when it's not your turn, as you have things to pay attention to.

The rest of the game is solid as well, being a race to 21 points, but those two innovations are really the parts that made the game for me.

I had a lot of fun playing this game.  My first game took longer than I wanted, but I think this was more to do with the unsure play of the 2 Boardgame newbies I was playing with.  30 minutes seems a fair time for this game.  I don't know if it is just the dice, or the theme, but this game seems to feel very similar to Roll For the Galaxy.  Sort of a Roll for the Galaxy Lite, but this might be due to playing the games so close together.  I want to introduce this to my kids, but am happy to also play it with my more serious gamer friends.  Interesting choices to be made here, and all in a little itty bitty box. I like the hidden missions, as well as the planet powers, and paying for the follow means you really need to think about what you want to copy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game was mentioned when I was looking for a solo game on /r/boardgames.

I watched the Tabletop episode, and it looked like a faster, lighter, and more interactive version of Roll for the Galaxy.

I ordered the non-deluxe edition on Amazon, from Gamelyn Games. Some of the reviews on Amazon had problems with other third-party sellers.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Based on 1 play with 4 players:

This is one of those games that is, in every way, a totally serviceable design but is unlikely to set the world on fire.

For me it feels a bit like My First Roll for the Galaxy. It has some important distinctions from Roll (importantly, player interaction) but coming from a game with much more complex economy management and combo building it does feel much more like an "intro" game. I had expected the two games to feel more different.

Really, you do have a lot of nice little choices here - but I think in the long run the linear empire progression could hurt replayability. That remains to be seen though.

Giving it a provisional 7 as I've only ever played solo. Might change if I play a multi-player game. Enjoyable, light 4x-ish type of game. Best part is it finishes in about an hour or less.

Meh. I thought this was generally boring. Once again, the only points of interaction are races for things, and take that.

I like when small boxes are filled with big games, and TEG fits that bill. The Culture mechanism keeps players involved during others' turns, and dice manipulation keeps play from feeling too random--though bad rolls can still be costly. The solo mode is vastly better than RftG's convoluted robot program, so it scratches the same itch.

Rated 6 after one play. 

Not a bad game... it's basically roll dice, spend dice as actions to gain resources and advance on tracks to conquer planets for points. It works fine. The only problem I found is that, with five players, the downtime was noticeable. There is a "follow the leader" mechanic like Puerto Rico, but it requires culture as a resource, and most of us had precious little of it. That meant it's a turn where the start player is twiddling dice while others watch.

I'd happily play it again with two or three players just to see if that improves my impression.

A quick filler game that I enjoyed. Roll dice, take actions, and conquer planets. It is definitely lighter than Roll for the Galaxy, but it does play faster and still has some interesting decisions. An added bonus is the culture mechanic where ala Glory to Rome or Eminent Domain you can follow when it is not your turn if you have culture. Now if the dice don't go your way you may have no culture and nothing to do while you wait for your turn, but when you do have culture it keeps you engaged throughout. I like what it did and thought the planet powers were better than that in Harbour so that's a definite plus. I can't wait to try out the solo mode and see what's coming in the expansion. 

A likely keeper but the 4 player game took an hour even with 2 experienced players and was just too long for a promised filler. I may keep it for lower player counts, but now I'm a bit hesitant on this with more than 3.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Players having at least two ships leaching culture (pay 1 culture to follow any culture die to get 2+ culture) and maxing out their colony track as quickly as they can have dominated the games I've played. I can't see any other strategy that can compete with that. If that's the case, it could seriously limit's this game's interest or replay value. Is it another case of the Kickstarter curse of the underdeveloped game?

TEG is, arguably, the strongest of the TE games. And that's saying something. Galaxies sets the bar for small, enthralling games. A race to earn victory points, players spend the entire time trying to balance growing their empire and colonizing planets. The ability to roll, then reroll dice to benefit your empire is a mechanic that ensures it's not a one-and-done situation where the dice rule your fate. Granted, we've had some bad rolls, and some worse re-rolls, but having the option to pay for another chance is clutch to keeping you in the hunt. 

The follow mechanic is also brilliant as it ensures no player has too much down time. Unlike some games where you pass off the dice, then go out for pizza, TEG keeps each player plugged in with an option to follow the current player's lead. 

Overall, TEG is a fast, fun trend-setter than gets more playtime than most game in our collection. It's easy to learn, easy to teach, and rewarding from the first roll of the dice to the count of Victory Points.

Takes a little bit to learn (we watched the TableTop episode so it didn't take us long, but teaching it to other players can take a little bit) but super fun game once you have it down. I love that I don't have to carry a huge box around when bringing it to someones house to play. For some reason it usually takes us closer to 45 minutes to an hour to play. It could be because we are overthinking it. I will admit I have a little AP (analysis paralysis.)

Ehhhh. This is definitely the most disappointing game in my collection in terms of how psyched I was before getting it compared to how I feel now. There's some fun to be had in here but it just feels so muddled. For me it just boils down to doing 1 of three things every turn; earn currency A, earn currency B, or exchange currency A for currency B. The planets are mostly variations on this same concept and all feel the same. The dice actions essentially come in pairs so it feels like I'm rolling 3-sided dice (use a planet, advance on a planet, harvest a planet), and I'm very blasé towards the secret objectives (fully upgrade your empire? Come on, how is it even possible to NOT do this in the game?). This is based entirely from a 2 player perspective so maybe with more players there's more variability (admittedly some of the secret missions look more interesting), and I'll check out the solo rules at some point but frankly I'm in no rush. People seems to love this game and obviously they see something in it that I just don't.

Another Tiny Epic success.  You roll dice and use the dice depending upon the die face rolled.  You can send ships to other planets to gain their victory points and gain their special ability, or land a ship and gain that ability immediately.  These planet bonuses can make wonderful chains to lead to victory.  But you must also upgrade your game board in order to gain access to additional dice, to aid in getting done everything you want to do.

The game does okay with two, but much better with more.

I backed this on Kickstarter. After watching reviews on the previous "Tiny Epic" games, I wasn't expecting much. I'm glad to have been proven wrong. The dice rolls and action choices are meaningful. The planets you seek to expand your empire on to provide significant tactical and strategic benefits. The components are excellent quality. After playing this one time with some co-workers during lunch a couple of them were immediately looking for a place to buy this. I'd consider that a great sign for this game.

All in all... A great game, tiny or not.

This small little game has everything you want: Dice rolling, strategic decisions and you even get to do things during your opponents turn. Very fast paced.

Components: Super cool planet art. Fun spaceship pawns. Good iconography on the dice and cards. Overall, too tiny. The player board feels squished. The dice, the most central part of the game, should be big and chunky. Player boards and dice could be enlarged and still fit in that box.

Experience: The dice mechanism is solid. Unlike in Yahtzee-style games, I get to use my dice as I go, which can change the game state, making it cheaper/more profitable to then use or re-roll other dice.

The planets themselves, and their powers, aren't particularly interesting. Playing to a point cap seems arbitrary.

Worker placement with a theme that more or less holds its own. Players score points by developing their home planet, colonizing free planets, and fulfilling their secret mission. This is done by throwing dice, giving players 6 possible actions:
1) fly to a planet and make use of the action of that planet
2) collect energy from the energy planets (among which your home planets) where you have ships
3) collect culture from the culture planets where you have ships
4) advance on the colonisation track of a political planet
5) advance on the colonization track of an economic planet
6) use an action of your galaxy (home planets + colonized planets)

Players start with 2 out of a max of 4 space ships, 1 energy and 1 culture, and 5 dice. The home planet can be developed (=increasing the number of dice to a max of 7, unlocking the 2 extra space ships, increasing VP to a max of 8) by handing in energy or culture.
Energy can also be used to reroll the number of dice of your choosing, while culture can be used to copy the last die played by another player (=action in other player's turn).
When flying to a free planet players choose to use the action of the planet (e.g. move 1 space forward on 1 colonization track and 1 back on another) or to place their space ship on the colonization track. When they are the first to complete the track, the planet (and VP) is added to their galaxy. As of that moment you can use the action of this planet when you throw the home galaxy side of the dice. Other players' ships on the planet are simply returned to their own home planet.
Each player also receives 2 secret mission cards (most energy or culture at end of game, or most economic planets,...) at the start of the game, of which 1 is chosen. If you succeed you gain an extra 3 points, if you share success you gain 2.
The game is dice driven, but you get a free reroll and can use energy as much as you want to reroll any number of dice. This minimizes bad dice roll frustration. A great plus !!!

RATING: 6
Quite a bit going on for a dice rolling filler due to how the dice are your restricted role selection choices and the ability for others to follow your actions. Ends quickly still since it aims to be a lighter game so the strategies for racing toward the end game points seem straightforward despite the other neat layers to the game.

RATING: 9
Bought this because Scott Almes designed it and I loved his game Harbour.
A small box but a lot of game! I play mostly solo and the AI in this ("Rogue Galaxy") is not only a quick way to learn the game but fun in and of itself. 

It's a small box and the price put me off initially (I got for $32) but when I considered how many times I bought $40 to $60 games only to unbox and find 75% of the space inside was air, this is a steal! Kudos for eschewing the inflated box.

Short set up time, nice balance of laying out a strategy AND dealing with the unexpected. Cards and chits are quality (ie not so thin that they plastic wrap they came in already warped them.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Yet again the "Tiny" is what makes this game so fiddly. There is a great game here and it should just be "normal" size. 

Even though I don't like that the game is smaller it's still a fantastic game, however I highly recommend you getting the Beyond the Black expansion because it really pushes the game to the next level. I wouldn't play without it because it gives you more choices with bad die rolls and makes the game feel more thematic as you explore space trying to stay away from black holes.

The better of the two Tiny Epic games that I was able to play at Con of the North. Lots of dice rolling and movement options. The following action can start to get tiresome and slow players are either always taking turns after the fact or missing out. To avoid this, you need lots of long pauses that slow things down for everyone. There is still a good amount of dice luck involved. My first round was pretty much worthless as I rolled everything I didn't need to. It's a game that exists and I would play it if nothing else presented itself.

Tiny Epic Galaxies (TEG) is a nice little dice filler with quite some room for clever play through the usage of the planet abilities. The copy mechanism helps to reduce the downtime but apart from it, there's really nothing new mechanics-wise. But nonetheless, I've enjoyed my few plays of TEG and look forward to try it a few more times.

This was the first Tiny Epic game that I bought, as I decided to look into portable games for travel. (Lords of Waterdeep is too big to bring without checking a bag...) I went with this first because it was on sale at Amazon and it seemed sort of similar to Race for the Galaxy. I like the solo version a lot.

Tiny in box if not in price, this game packs a very reasonable 4X feel into a small box and a relatively short window of time (though games can drag a bit).  It seems everyone I talk to has had an awful first game (including myself, and yes, I do talk to myself) but once you have a handle on what's important the game manages to create a lot of scope.

Although a dice-based game, TEG isn't nearly as random as one might fear, largely due to the flexibility of dice ordering and re-rolling. Determining the best ordered combination of rolled dice and planet abilities is the real meat of the game and it is quite suitable for casual play thanks to the simple rules. All of this means that TEG takes a bit longer to play than I would like, however.

Tiny Epic Galaxies can be a little slow on the first game or two but once you click with how things work and begin to play optimally this is a very cool little game.

While Tiny Epic Galaxies utilises dice, it doesn't feel like you're depending solely on luck and it has a surprising big dose of strategy.

Always pay attention to the cards available for conquering and how to best optimise your activation sequence as you can chain some pretty awesome and convoluted combos to achieve the end goal.

The box is too small. Otherwise, this would be a 10. Seriously. I love this game but it is so small it is awkward, would have been almost perfect if larger. 

Collection Notes: we also have the expansion Beyond the Black. 

You need the expansion, really, because the pilot cards add that much to the experience. The unexplored space on the other hand was not great because the rewards were minimal compared to the consequences and because tracking the badges was more annoying than fun. We play with the pilots but not with the unexplored space.

Pleasantly surprised by this dice roller.
The ability to follow another players action keeps you engaged throughout other players turns and I like that there are two options when you go to a planet,orbit it and hope to claim the action upon it for yourself only, or jump in quick and take the sction and then zoom off somewhere else. 
Pilot add a different way to grab victory points and the little upgraded shops are cool. The unexplored space wasn't really explored I  The game as the first two things we found were a black hole and a mine field and so that made exploring fairly risky.
Not entirely sure which bits were expansion bits but overall good fun with lots of options for your turn
I was dubious having played tiny epic defenders but I actually enjoyed this one.

Didn't care for this.  There are better filler games out there that are fun.

It did not feel like any galactic conquest.  It felt like I was rolling a bunch of dice, and putting spaceship meeples on cards.  Not very interesting.

The rules were easy enough, but seemed fiddly/unthematic in places: you don't get culture points from spaceships in your galaxy, but you do for energy.  You can't move from a planet to its orbit, why?  Many planets had edge case scenarios that had to be further claried on times where you could/could not use their power when following.  

I HATE edge cases, it usually happens because the designer is trying to shoehorn cool powers into a ruleset that doens't support them.  In this case, rather than avoid confusion and leave out the problematic planets, they printed clarifications on the inside of the box.

After 2 plays: 
Playtime is not 30 minutes. It's longer. Optimizing your moves takes some time. Maybe after some games it can get closer, but 45 maybe.

And as the game is optimization game, there is a big change of AP. And not just for player in turn, but sometimes also for others because of following mechanic. All players actions have to be considered in your turn. 

Following mechanic is the part that is most difficult to keep handle on. Player usually plans his turn and then starts to set dice: I fly with this to here and then advance with these 2 dice. Then someone says I follow the advance and other say wait I follow the fly and its a mess for little while.

Game is solid and good, but just drops out of filler category because of the time it takes to play.

I'm usually not a fan of work replacement/resource games with a lot of strategic depth, BUT, this was truly a tiny epic game!

It was easy to learn but with a looot of strategic depth. First time I played it it made my head hurt a little but I quickly eased up to it and really started to like it.

Das hervorstechende Merkmal von TINY EPIC GALAXIES ist natürlich seine Konfektionsidee: großes Eurogame in Zigarettenschachtel. Wäre TEG als "großes Spiel" erschienen, wäre kein Hannebambel auf die Idee gekommen, es als verfehltes Lilliput zu betrachten. Unabhängig von der genialen Konfektion ist TEG ein Würfelaktionsetzspiel, das sich neben gelungen Aktionen und hübschen Ideen, auch ein paar Krückstöcken bedient wie "Following" oder "nochmal würfeln" für zunächst umme und dann billig ("1 Energie"). Die größte Leistung von TEG hier als Stellvertreter der Tiny-Serie bleibt für mich tatsächlich die verurteilsfreie Veranschaulichung, dass Material in vielen Brettspielfällen eben auch einfach eine Form von Materialismus ist, der sich schön und sinnlich erfahren lässt. Ich verstehe, dass TEG viele Fans hat, auch wenn mich die relative Konventionalität des Spieldesigns zur Fancrowd nicht ganz dazugehören lässt. Dazu gehört übrigens auch die doch erstaunliche Downtime bei zumindest vier Kosmonauten.

RATING: 7
Fun dice game in a small package.  As mentioned elsewhere the solo mode it comes with is way too easy.I tried re-rolling dice that the scripted opponent can't use and that was a bit more challenging.  I'll probably pull it out again at some point for solo, and it is a decent game multiplayer.  I have yet to see what the expansions add.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
The ability to follow actions by using a resource is a neat enough idea, but wildly bogs down the pace of the game since a player has to lock a die in, take the action, and then wait for each other player to pass priority.
The run away leader is pretty strong with this one. If one players gets slightly ahead in upgrading his galaxy due to some lucky dice rolls the game is basically over but still has most of its duration to play out.

This getting ahead may be tied to a strong amount of left-right binding: When the player to your right is doing well, he will be able to climb up tracks to take over planets before you when other players take those actions, effectively crippling you (since there is no compensation for lost actions when another player takes a planet). The game effectively becomes one of whoever is sitting to the left of the unluckiest player wins.

This ended up being way drier and more procedural than I'd hoped--something I never got the feeling from while playing Tiny Epic Kingdoms.  I'll give this more time, but I found this a mildly interesting diversion at best.  I will say that Scott Almes has the whole "take a thematic game down to its bare bones" pretty down pat.  I just think that maybe this time, he took it right down to the bones, but now all you see are the bones.

With Tiny Epic Kingdoms, I get the feeling of running a fantasy empire, even though it is a simple resource gathering/action selection game with some light battling.  It has been abstracted but there are thematic bits of muscle still left on the bone, if that makes any sense at all.

INITIAL IMPRESSION 
----------------------
This game is the best so far out of the "Tiny Epic" series.

It has good theme and the mechanics play well in this game. You have choices when it comes to developing your empire vs colonizing planets vs using planet abilities and gaining resources.

Culture engine is very important as that will allow you to take a lot of extra actions and be involved in other players turns. The game is all about getting lots of actions and exploiting planet combos.

However the game does take longer than a light game so I wouldn't play with many players. Also the dice roll can be very RNG at times, which is why culture is important. I do wish the converter didn't require 3 dice to use efficiently and just required 2 like roll for the galaxy

UPDATE
----------------------
Played with 3p, the game worked great. Still a little long but the two people were new. Probably 45-1h game. A lot of play and interaction here, fun game.

RATING: 6.5
Rating based on solo play. Rather dry; I don't feel the theme much. Many decisions seem obvious. Feels like it should have more ways to mitigate luck and manipulate dice, or culture should be easier to come by at least. Revised solo rules aren't clear from the rulebook and needed to find designer/publisher clarifications in the forums. Overall it seems like there's not enough game there, at least for solo play; BtB expansion improves it, but combined cost is too high and makes the game even fiddlier. Playing solo with 6 planets in the display makes more powers available, making the game more interesting and varied (slightly easier too).

UPDATE: Definitely more interesting MP, but I worry about downtime. Feels too fiddly and complicated for what it is.

* replayable - the mechanic is fun and variety of planets & "power-ups" (colonization actions) means the game feels fresh everytime

The best Tiny Epic game yet. The iconography in the components is consistent and makes it easy to teach. I really like the dice allocation mechanics and the "follow" mechanic is very good, keeping players focused even during other player's turns. I have yet to check, but I get the feeling you could get into a loop if you're flying next to two or more culture planets.

Unfortunately I get the feeling the best move is pretty obvious in every situation, which makes me feel that I didn't get a chance to play.

The solo mode plays well and had a variety of opponents in different difficulties.

This was the second Scott Almes game I've played, the first being Harbour. I liked this much better than Harbour and it was a lot more thinky than I expected. I love how much game was packed into the small (and very high quality) box. The one negative I'd say is simply that the dice rolls can really hoze you if you can't get what you need to finish of a planet or something else. Other than that I'd say it's a very solid game.

Tiny and epic are pretty accurate descriptors: a lot of game in a small box. Dice mitigation is well done and the pace of the game seems just about perfect for what it is. The game isn't overly deep but just enough so that your tactical choices feel meaningful. The hidden roles add a bit of strategy to this effectively.

Ultimately the game is a bit too far on the light side. It's enjoyable, and something I'd bring out around non-gaming friends, but on games nights I'd rather reach for a different dice roller. (Castles of Burgundy) 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Irritating little game. One playthrough of this was enough to ruin game night. The mechanic of being able to act on others' turns sounds neat in concept, but it's stupidly broken in practice. Firstly, it takes forever for people to take their turns and even longer for them to determine which actions they want to "follow" on other players' turns. Second, this mechanic allows heinous crap like allowing Player C to determine which of Player A and Player B wins the game, after the game has already been ended. Third, this puts one particular resource at a huge premium, even though both resources are ostensibly meant to be of the same value. This game took a very long chunk of game night (90 minutes), and it wasn't even fun. I'm never playing it again.

On a shelf filled with massive boxes like Gloomhaven, 7th Continent, Blood Rage, and so many "big box" expansions, it's just refreshing to be able to play a game you can fit in your pocket.

RATING: 9.5
An absolutely outstanding dice game, easily the best Tiny Epic game and one of my favorite games period. I love the way you can save resources to piggyback on other players' actions, and the choices you have to make between using planetary abilities immediately or trying to win the planet for points and be the only player who can use those abilities for the rest of the game. It's also one of the best, most fun and engaging solo games I've played.

RATING: 3
Tiny Epic Galaxies is a par-for-the-course worker placement game. Worker placement is divided between getting in immediate benefit or racing to get end game points in each location. The game is fine, but doesn't scale well. It runs a bit long for the type of game it is, and has a "follow" mechanic to ape other's actions. In theory, this keeps players interested when others take turns, but left the opposite effect. Not having "follow" points made players actively not care when it is not their turn. Tiny Epic Galaxies is likely best at 2 or 3 players.

Two of my gaming friends backed this on Kickstarter, and I had opportunity to play it with each of them and with others multiple times before I finally purchased it at Origins 2016. I had an opportunity to buy in 8 months earlier, but went with a copy of Codenames instead. 

I've heard it compared to Glory to Rome, and while I never would have made that leap myself, I can see where that thought comes from. It scales very well from 2 all the way to the full 5 players, although if you're going to add players be prepared for a much longer game. I haven't tried the solitaire game yet.

Not too bad for a dice game, but the luck factor may be a bit too high, as the dice severely restrict your choices. Each symbol on the dice allow you to perform a specific action, but too many of these depend on some condition, like having resources to spend or a ship orbiting a specific type of planet. Also, too many of the special powers of the planets is to delay one or two chosen players in the orbits they must complete to gain a planet - which can be decisive, since planets are worth a significant amount of victory points. I played the game with just one opponent and we didn't use those powers, so it didn't take too long, but I suspect my rating will go down once I play it with more players.

Partida a 5. El entreturno enorme, según avanza el juego tienes cada vez más cosas por hacer. No parece que el juego sea muy ágil con más de 3 jugadores.

Otra cosa que no me gustó fueron los combos y estrategias, todo parece muy bestia y sin medir, hay un tope físico, pero un jugador pícaro puede aprovecharse muy bien de las oportunidades, el caso es que las estrategias pueden degenerar mucho. Esto de por si no es malo, habrá jugadores que les guste, no es mi caso.

Le falta pulir y limar todas esas cosas que le convierten en un juego amateur.

Para remate es mas largo de lo que el propio juego debería exigir debido a su complejidad.

Del autor de "Pequeños Grandes Reinos" y conjugando algunas de las mecanicas de juego de aquel con tematica espacial y ejecución de acciones mediante "tareas determinadas mediante tiradas de dados" (mecanica que comparten muchos juegos como simbolo arcano o guerra del anillo, entre otros). 

El conjunto es todo un acierto. Tiene todo lo bueno del "pequeños grandes reinos" y le da un cuarto de vuelta absolutamente genial.

I never really cared for the Tiny Epic stuff and none of them could convince me. This one isn't an exception, even though it's an ok game.

Having played with 5 people, all of them wanted to play it again with less (2-3) people only, as it really didn't work out well with 5.

Once you built up (more ships and dice), all you need is culture to follow the other players actions, pretty underwhelming.

Tiny Epic Galaxies is, in my opinion, nothing terribly innovative. Nonetheless things are generally pretty slick in this package -- I simply think that the game doesn't encourage multiple players very well as there are far too many actions to be taken by each and every player. This can mean that turns can draw out indefinitely if playing with a table that doesn't play fast and loose. While the option to follow is also present, having to go around the table to verify if folks are following or not (for each action, 4-7 of them) can drag the game out.

I honestly expected this game to be a sort of race to get to 21 points, with players doing mostly the same thing. But there was actually a satisfying amount of strategy.  Components are very good - love the meeple rocketships! This will definitely hit the table again.

1 play. That was pretty good! Streamlined, elegant, straightforward. Clear artwork. Cute. Theme thin but fits. Cool dice! Components are (fortunately) not tinier than they need to be. 

We played with 5, which works. But I guess 4 or even 3 max is even better. 

Want to explore more. Might even purchase it! One of the best of 2016 so far.

Great game in a small box. Game went pretty quick playing with only 2 people, which is good because it took us 3 playthroughs to correctly apply the rules. Component quality is great. Everything fits nicely, if a little tight, in the tiny box. All of the cards present information easily and clearly so you can keep track. Would be a 10 if we got all the rules from the first play.

I like this game's solitaire variant quite a bit. It's a nice weight for a dice game; not too fiddly or rules heavy and not just a push-your-luck Yahtzee variant. Good game. Not great, but good

EDIT: Played this two player and like it much more with two than solo. The game loses points for being samey and too light, but the extra little bit of secret goals and following is a nice touch in multiplayer. A little long but a good dice filler with more meat than usual

The single sour note so far is the godawful planet names.  I'm guessing they must be named after backers?  Which is cool for exactly one person—and then the rest of us are left scratching our heads wondering why this awesome planet (as far as the art is concerned, anyway) has a name that sounds suspiciously like some random dude.  Where they should be cool, evocative and memorable they're instead clunky, nonsensical, and difficult to parse.  [i]Bummer.[/i]

This is a fantastically dense dice game. All the options and complexity of a 4X space game, crammed into a tiny box and simple rules. What makes this game particularly outstanding is the "follow" mechanic, which allows you to take actions during other players' turns. This creates a game of constant action and tension between players, exciting to the final roll. 

There is even a solo mode of the game against an enemy with versatile and simple rules. A great kind of solitaire.

If there is a downside, it is that the game is far more varied and interesting with more players as there are more planets in play with a wider range of special abilities; a two-player game is much more predictable. However a 5 player game takes a LOT longer to play than the suggested time on the box.

Given that our first play of this took at least 2 hours with five players, I would recommend never playing with five and I probably won't play with four. From someone who has played the others in the Tiny Epic series, I am finding this set of games to not have enough theme and flavor to justify the play time. You may be able to fit the game in your pocket but I would only see this advantageous if planning to travel. Otherwise I'd rather play a normal or big box game.

Played with 3 and 2. The game has quite a lot to analyze on your turn and this leads to AP. Consider that the analysis needs to be redone after each reroll and it becomes a problem. Even with all that thinking, sometimes you just use track full of energy for rerolls and get nothing useful. 

In addition the secret goals appear to be fairly unbalanced.

Ok, after how wicked fun TEK is, I will back this on day one.

aaaaand after a play of the PnP:

Yep, fun stuff! Much more puzzly than TEK, and with subtler but more complex interactions. Definitely different enough to warrant owning both, especially at the price. I think it's wise of Gamelyn to capitalize on the brand they've got going for as long as they have interest in making games that are quick to play and small of footprint.

Long term, I think I'll find TEK to be my preferred TE of the two. But I'm looking forward to backing TEG.

aaaaaand after 2 more plays of the PnP:

I have now played 2p twice and 3p once. 3p slows it down appreciably. I think 4p would be way too much downtime. 2p is still good, but I think with 3+ I would rather play TEK every time.

It's basically Roll for the Galaxy lite. Which isn't a particularly bad thing to be, but it doesn't play especially well at two, and it's not interesting enough that we feel the need to own it. Roll for the Galaxy is a deeper dice-roller, Nations: The Dice Game is a more streamlined, less tiny civ-building dice game and Alea Iacta Est is a better dice/worker-placement fusion.

Not for me. There may be some fun interactions and strategy, but it plays too long for my liking. I also like Roll Through the Ages a lot more for a similar feel (read: Yahtzee with more), and it isn't anywhere near as charming as RTtA.

Edit:
Yeah, this game seems really confused how it wants to play. Interactions get pretty convoluted once you start looking into all the possible moves you can make on both your and your opponents' turns. That's normally a good thing, but when that much complexity is strapped to a chassis with a huge amount of luck, it seems jarring. I play this because my nephew wants to, but I wouldn't play it again without him requesting it.

Not a game I'm wanting to play again.

It is scrimping and saving resources to generate an extra resource on the next turn and to optimise a resource generation on following turns before eventually getting a couple of VPs later down the line, while realising that everyone else already knows that it can be achieving more cheaply using the overpowered 'follow' mechanic. 

None of decisions were fun; and with 4 players, a poor player (like I was) can look forward to substantial periods of downtime, in which to regret the mistake they make in turn one, that make it impossible to catch-up.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (December 2016)

I haven’t played any Tiny Epic game before so I didn’t know what to expect. In fact I’m not sure if all the Tiny Epic games are similar in some way or not. The reason I did my best to stay away from these games was the name “Tiny Epic”. To me, that name speaks of a small simple game trying to appear like a big strategy game (just like Eight-Minute Empire, a game I dislike) and that’s just not my cup of tea. However, when my friend was explaining the game, my enthusiasm for the game began to increase.

The rules can be explained under 12 minutes. The game plays up to five players and that was the player count on my game. At first I had a lot of enthusiasm for Tiny Epic Galaxies but with 5 players the downtime is WAY TOO MUCH for such a simple game. The downtime was so big I began explaining other games to other players between turns (I had zero culture for most of the game). I think Tiny Epic Galaxies is best with 3 fast players, I also think allowing the game to go up to 5 players is a disservice to game itself. I didn’t enjoy my play of the game due to the enormous downtime. I refuse to play ever again with 5 players.

After my game, I was ready to sell the game, but after I consulted that decision with the pillow, I decided to give it another chance to woe me, this time I will play with 3 players only.

The theme is nice and the game components are very good, the custom dice are gorgeous. The art is ok.

The game decisions are mainly tactical, you cannot plan far ahead, but still the game is fun if played at a fast pace. On your turn you roll the dice and make the best you can with them. There is a lot of luck with the dice and with the cards but you can mitigate it using more resources and with clever play, that is, you always have something interesting to do with your dice. I love that you can follow other players in their turn (very similar to Glory to Rome). Culture seems more important that the other resources, but in our game, the player who least amassed culture won, so I’m not sure if this is an issue or not.

Bottom line, I´m pleasantly surprised with the Tiny Epic brand, the game does indeed have lots of decisions in a very small package :thumbsup:. I need to give it another chance to see if I should keep it in my game collection. Perhaps it has too much luck for me, I need to verify this point as well.

First impression
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
(Vanilla game only. Have not played with Beyond the Black, but mechanics changes present in the expansion might be enough to increase the rating of the base game) 

I have played this several times now, both solo and with one other person. While the game is definitely enjoyable, I don't think that it hits much higher than a 7 for me. Form factor is definitely one of the great draws of this game. If you are looking for a game that is small, possibility of solo play, then this was made for you.

Solo Play pits you against an engine, which is ok, but having played on a few of the difficulties, the difference happens at the speed of galaxy maturation level. Which means the solo play is deciding how to most effectively build your engine when being thrown different pieces to the puzzle. 

Competitive I would give it a slightly higher, at a 7.5 or 8. Again, form factor plays a large roll in the draw of this game. The game can be explained in a few minutes, there are a few moving parts that keep the game interesting, and enough ways to win that playing against different players can show you different sides of that game. 

That being said, after a few times, I don't feel drawn back to play the game again. I enjoyed my plays, but this will be reserved for long airport stays where a table is available and introducing new players to board gaming.

Not being familiar with the series, I'm not sure where the appeal lies. Small footprint or box size isn't a priority for me, and the generic theme is not attractive at all. When comparing to something like Roll for the Galaxy, this simply doesn't hold up. Everything here feels recycled, and the interaction (through the "follow" action, taken from Glory to Rome) is boring. The die rolling means that the majority of your actions are forced, often leaving you with few meaningful choices. And watching each person take their turn is boring. The simultaneous nature of Roll for the Galaxy is a perfect example of how to minimize downtime and keep a game moving. This seems like it should be a 10 - 15 minute game. I would probably have felt very differently had we played with fewer players, but regardless of the player count, this is probably just not for me.

In principle it has everything you need for a good compact game. In practice it falls short. It is a dice game and the luck of the rolls is still there and the end can be a total anticlimax with several players having all their ships on their homeworlds. The biggest issue for me, however, is the follow mechanism. It is unthematic and makes the game unnecessarily epically longer.

The core of Tiny Epic Galaxies is actually a very sound dice and worker placement game. For a game based around luck, the designers have done an excellent job at making it so that your dice rolls seldom feel completely unworkable. It loses some points for component quality (a few pieces have already shown wear after less than a dozen plays) and for lack of strategic depth.

*This rating is only based on 2 plays, at the moment*

THE GOOD: 
1)Dice mechanic is fun. I love the flexibility of it (even though I think it needs more variety).
2)Art is really fun, and the components are great (custom dice? Yes please!)
3)The two options for ships placement and the overall empire mechanic is pretty clever, and the gameplay is smooth and fun.

THE BAD:
1)Dice need to be mitigated with something besides rerolling. The conversion is another option, but it's very costly and possibly overpriced. Mitigating well in a game like this HUGE, as having some bad rolls (while your opponent has good ones) can easily lose the game for you. This leaves a strategic game with an element of luck feeling like a luck game with an element of strategy. If this was a coop or semi-coop game (i.e. players competing against a game), I could dismiss this. But, in a directly competitive game, I cannot. Also, there will be times that you cannot use all of your dice; that's another failure in design, in my opinion.
2)The planets are not balanced, when you consider that colonizing them requires good rolling/rerolling. If you're lucky, you'll get the big pointers and win the game.

OVERALL REVIEW: The game plays smoothly, even with the 'following' ability. I could see AP being a potential problem, but I'm not sure if it's enough to deter. The game has balance issues. If you're playing smart and maximizing what you've got, there's still a large chance it won't be enough. This is because of the luck of the dice. This is another example of incorporating dice, into a strategic game, carelessly. I will also echo others and say that there is a little bit of a runaway leader.
I actually do really like the game; I'd say it's probably good. If you're going to make a micro game that is strategic, your mechanics better be SOLID. Everything else seems solid, except the dice. Unfortunately, that mechanic is the meat of the game, and it's poor execution is why this game is good and NOT great, which is sad.

1st Play: Not enough options in the center of the table to make use of all your die rolls. This game has been compared to Roll Through the Ages, but Roll Through the Ages is better-designed: in that game, you can do something with all of your die faces, even the "bad" skulls. In Epic Galaxies, I kept rolling Diplomacy die-faces when there were NO cards out on the table that could use them. This game needs more options for a greater sense of player-control.

Decent short game! I like this game because even though it's a dice rolling game and I'm more of a eurogamer, it's evenly matched as far as dice rolls go and neither player can outplay the other by a significant amount. It's a nice quick game if you want to get in a few before bedtime and is a great game to play and have a good time with your friends or significant other!

Kellemes, pörgős kockajáték jó kis döntési helyzetekkel.

A szabályok gyorsan elmagyarázhatók, elég intuitív minden, és nem mellesleg látványos is, ahogy az űrhajóink kirepülnek, gyarmatosítanak, stb. Nagyon jó kikapcsolódási lehetőséget biztosít.

I have played this mainly as a two player game with my wife. We love it. But playing it 3 or 4 players really opens the game up...wow. Good interaction with a plethora of meaningful decisions. I really do not see why anyone would play Roll for the Galaxy now that this game exists. 

It is a wonderful, quick engine building/dice rolling/action selection game. I hated Roll for the Galaxy, but this seems to do what Roll tried to do. It just does it without feeling like you are playing the game alone.

Initial rating. Tiny Epic Galaxies is another elegant design that will probably cease to be tiny when the expansion comes out. Our group enjoyed it well enough, but it was obvious that the dice are a weakness that can't easily be mitigated. The cost of changing the face of a die is really high, which means that it won't often be used.

I do like the use of culture and energy in the game, and especially the ability to spend culture to follow others' actions. I just wish there was some other way to mitigate the luck of the roll, because it can be frustrating when the difference between the winner and the loser seems to be decided entirely by luck. I doubt a game this luck driven will get to the table often.

Awesome game!! Just learned of Gamelyn Games recently via the Kickstarter for Tiny Epic Quest. Playing the demo of that and decided to branch out and try other games. Galaxies and Western both were highly recommended by the community so I started there. 

I've really enjoyed this and have recommended the games I have played to family and friends. I'm a little older (46) and have a toddler (just turned 2!) so my time going out and having a "game night" has disappeared! I really appreciate the solo aspects of the game and IF I get with some friends being able to play with them is an added bonus right now. Can't wait until my son is a couple years older, I know we'll enjoy these games (and I am sure future Tiny Epic games) a lot!

For those that want a deeper gaming experience, and to be fair this one isn't HUGE which isn't a bad thing, as a matter of fact its one of the draws for me with time constraints, wait for the Tiny Epic Galaxies: Beyond the Black. It adds pilots and special ships just to name a few things. This looks like it is going to be fantastic and add a lot to this game, if you want it deeper. There will be times (if/when I have extra time) that I will go for the deeper play but I know for that "Fast" game fix I need from time to time (if nothing else but to hear that sweet sound of dice rolling) I will be back to play the normal version of TEG without a doubt! The physical footprint of this game is VERY small too, which is a BIG bonus at times. Easy to take it with me and set up fast and plow through a game. Its awesome to set it up and have strangers engage with "Whats that?" and be able to explain to them in 5 minutes (max) how to to play and SHOW them while you are doing it. I would LOVE to see more Rogue galaxies, these and planet cards would make for a very fast/easy expansion possibility. I'd love to see a TEG: Planet Expansion Pack. Possibly 2 or 3 even. 

These guys seems to go above and beyond from what I can tell from the first (will not be my last!) Kickstarter I've backed with them. Can't wait to see what is on the horizon from them.

I played this about a month ago and noticed I didn't write a comment down.

What I dislike. 
First of all  it should come with a warning.
 "Culture is important".
Why is it important since without culture you can't follow . And follow is broken.
This could possibly be fixed if you are not allowed to follow on culture but you can.
Or you can only follow once.
Sure the game will take al ittle longer.

Now from heart I think that the best strategy is besides if other players have no culture don't go for culture yourself. But follow when other players do. 

Talking about strategy. Your strategy is being able to follow. Which is kind of strange. Than you could steal some planets from other players by combining two dice to form another one. (this the other players can't follow)

What I do like.
Well it has me thinking.
And I think the sologame could be an okay exploration with a considerable amount of push your luck in it. 

conclusion :
It is a luckfest. There is push your lcuk in it but it has a considerable amount of luck in it that isn't push your luck.
Basic strategy is simple. Following means doing extra stuff outside your turn. If one of your opponents fail to see that and allows to follow possibly other players can win this.
There is a work around the follow part that slows the game down. doing actions in your turn that noone can follow.

Before writng this down I was thinking of getting it despite my rating of four as there are some things to do on your turn and it is quick.

To me and this is not because lack of comparisons. I would allways pick blueprints to play over this game. 
I have talked about what I like about treasure hunter. 
I like it because rounds are quick and there is scoring after each round. But you don't really know how many points each player has.
Each round you have a new chance to win the round. You start from scratch.
Blueprints has three scoring rounds. 
In Tiny Epic Galaxies however once you get low on culture you are out of the game.
And you have to endure the rest of the game while other people are making combos

In Tiny Epic Galaxies each player controls a galactic empire, aiming to expand their influence by acquiring highly contested planets and increasing their cosmic armada. The game revolves around an innovative dice-rolling combo mechanic. The number of dice you roll is determined by the strength of your galaxy. Each die is engraved with symbols representing the various actions you can take, such as moving a spaceship, increasing your culture or energy resources, or advancing your political or economic influence over newly discovered planets.

TEG is not a bad game at all. Its a nice little package of a game that does what it does, and does it pretty well. There is nothing revolutionary about the mechanics, but they do fit well together. Not sure how I feel about the theme and how it meshes with the overall gameplay. All in all I would say this is nice light little game to get your competitive juices flowing at the start of a game night. Is it going to revolutionize anything, hell no, but it is a decent 45 min of gaming.

Nice theme, good quality components, fun fun dice game! It can be a little too luck dependent, and it has the "rich get richer" problem, because when you earn points you get either a more powerful civilization (more dice and/or more spaceships), or special powers that make dice more useful. Overall a good game, certainly worth the price! Also is quite fast!

Im Winzigen Weltall muss man Würfel werfen und mit den Symbolen dann Aktionen durchführen, die das eigene Imperium erweitern, neue Planeten kolonisieren oder sonstige Aktionen auf Kartentexten ausführen, dabei dürfen alle anderen Spieler allerdings meine Aktion kopieren, wenn sie "Kultur" dafür zahlen. Die Erweiterung bringt dann nochmal Piloten mit rein, die, einmal angeworben, weitere dauerhafte Fähigkeiten mit ins Spiel bringen, ausserdem kann man ins Unbekannte fliegen und dort ebenfalls Siegpunkte abstauben. Die beiden Minierweiterungen erweitern jeweils das Grundspiel mit Satteliten, die man erhält, wenn man sein Imperium aufbaut und Planeten kolonisiert und mit Superwaffen, die man mit Satteliten aktivieren kann (spezielle Sonderaktion); sowie die Erweiterung mit Dronen, die mit Würfelergebnissen erkauft werden können und die eigenen Piloten verbessern.
Das Grundspiel gefällt mir sehr gut, vor allem die Option den Gegner zu kopieren. Auch die Erweiterung mit den Piloten und dem unbekannten Weltraum macht Spaß. Die beiden Minierweiterungen braucht man allerdings nicht. Sie fühlen sich nicht richtig ins Spiel integriert an. Die Superwaffen haben wir genauso wie die Drohnen kein einziges mal benutzt...

I previously played two other TE games (Kingdoms and Defenders) and wasn't blown away by either, but for some reason this spoke to me and I threw it into an order last year. This is the first real time it's gotten played (we played half a game a few months ago but we screwed up at least one major rule.) 

The first thing is that it's not as short as its name and size might suggest. Our game (with, granted, three newbs and one almost-newb) took well over an hour. Not too bad, but more than we thought. But as long as you know that, you're okay. It's very much like Eminent Domain except I much prefer this to that game. A lot of interesting choices, some take-that, and a nice look to it. I will say that even though I came in second, my secret mission -- have the fewest planets -- was a little frustrating because once your galaxy is maxed, planets are the only way to get VPs. But I guess in that case you go for fewer, bigger ones. At any rate, I enjoyed it and am glad it finally got played properly.

Don't play this with AP people, between the culture of copying other people's actions(which is a neat idea), the wealth of options you can do per turn, and the choice of what to reroll as some dice actions can go from being useless to incredibly useful based on what you get, this game that should be a light filler with a decent amount of depth can drag. I've always considered myself probably not a fan of dice placement games and my suspicions were confirmed here; without it this game's engine wouldn't work at all, but I don't like making the most of what you have when it seems artificial, especially when as previously mentioned some faces can be worthless without the right effects. The cards to me on a cursory glance don't seem to be that balanced although you could just ignore ever going for the weaker cards then if that turns out to be true, and I appreciate the variable powers. There is a little bit of rich gets richer but I don't think it's a runaway leader problem as there are also a couple of catchup cards and some wail on someone ones too. Overall not a bad game, but my lack of fondness of the main mechanism makes this game not for me.

Surprisingly good dice game.  You roll four dice to begin and use the dice to either acquire resources to re-role, take additional actions when not your turn using culture or advance on colonization tracks.   Or you can move ships to planets to start colonization.  Lastly there is a side which can allow you to expand your empire or use a special ability of a colonized planet.  

It reminds me a bit of Roll Through the ages.  Ok, components but very solid game.  I really like this game and it seems like a good "next step" game.

This game is a tremendous let down after the brilliant Tiny Epic Kingdoms.  It is too EURO for my tastes as the conflict is indirect and the players are playing the game and not each other.  Urgh!

Played much longer than I expected with 5 players. I think it took us an hour after rules explanation. I did not like the planet abilities that set other people back (e.g. -1 colonization), as that just slows down the game. Probably the most complicated Tiny Epic game. However, it was a solid and fun game.

Love this game. LOVE. 

Reasons to love:
* Tremendous solo play
* Easy setup / tear down
* Small footprint
* Great components
* Quick to learn but decently deep strategy
* Following is a cool mechanic

Games like this make me super happy and sad. Sad because I need more time and more friends to wrangle into playing.

I really enjoy 'race' games - where you have the same amount of turns (amount varies) to score higher than your opponents.  That's exactly what this is.  You have to be the most efficient player or at least throw some wrenches into your opponents' plans, if you're going to win.  Different planets will come out each game with different abilities so there's quite a bit of variety in actions available from game to game.

Rising up the ranks every time I play it. I love how the game kicks into overdrive, and every decision gets weightier and weightier as you near the end. My only gripe is that the game always ends way too quickly. There's so many cool planets with cool abilities, but I don't get to use many of them, at least for very long, before the game ends. You don't realize how many points you easily and quickly rack up (remember upgrading your colony gives you points as well), and it can happen pretty fast. Overall, a pretty great game that grows on you, but don't expect to build this massive sprawling empire, the game ends faster than that.

Holy moly does this drag at five.  Waiting for people to parse the results of a roll sucks when it's simultaneous in Roll for the Galaxy; having it sequential just makes me want to end it all.

08/15/17 Played Tiny Epic Galaxies with its Beyond the Black expansion. Overall I found the base game overly complicated and its heavy use of icons royally annoying. One of the worst was one of the die faces that looked like the stock market was on the rise. I think what it really meant was take some type of colony action. How anyone could get that out of an image of a jagged arrow I have no idea. I also found the "tiny" part (very small components and miniscule places to place them) quite irksome. I hope to never see the game or its expansion again.

8.5 for now. Might be an 8 or a 9. Need to play it more. It's pretty straight forward but also a little confusing when played right after games where you get what you roll.

I suspect this is generous, it's more of a 3 I think but I'll hold on until I've tried it a few more times maybe. The game is eh, fine. It's just that there is nothing to it that makes it anything but a perfectly mediocre game, like you could slap a "bog-standard" sticker on it and be done. 

Its a game, it plays, it does nothing interesting so why would I want to play it?

Almost a great little game, but the 'follow' ability seems a bit too strong.  I guess it does help make the game go more quickly, but almost too fast.  The dice look great and the different planets are a nice feature.  Sliding cards under the control card is a bad design idea, as all the wooden bits get knocked around.  Will need some more plays to solidify the rating.  Another play two player worked even better, and more smoothly than Tiny Epic Kingdoms.  Delivers a fun game with some choices in ~30 minutes.

Love this game! It's tiny - obviously - but as other reviewers have said, it just feels like a big box game. Play can be a little confusing at first, so be sure to play a few times before you get the gist of it. We've only done the 2-player version but it's a lot of fun. Gameplay takes about 45-1 hour to do but I know we'll get faster as time goes on. Will definitely look into the expansion sets as they come up as this will be something we'll keep playing time and time again!

The base game is good, but there's not enough to keep me interested for multiple plays. Just as well there's an amazingly good expansion to supplement it, taking the game to a whole new level. Rating reflects base game, and the Beyond the Black expansion takes it to 8.5

All plays (except one) are played with the Beyond the Black expansion. We would not play the base game again without it.

RATING: 5
This game is really, REALLY close to being awesome, but it falls just a bit short for me. It's essentially a racing game where you are rolling dice in a modified Yahtzee-like fashion. Because of this, big swings in points are likely to occur. There's a sense of engine building with the planets you gain, and being able to copy others' actions is a fun aspect to this game, but both of these actions are only on one side of each die you roll. As a result, aspects of this game that should feel important aren't featured as much as they should be. Along with this, games of this tend to be much longer than a game of this size and weight ought to be.

A lot of game in a tiny box and very fun as a solitaire game...but it's a poor multiplayer game.  Why?  Because individual turns near the end of the game TAKE FOREVER as endless re-rolls, calculation of probabilities, figuring out who will follow and what they will gain, and running through all the possible victory point configurations creates Analysis Paralysis!  Games can take hours!

Great compact game.  Works really nicely with 2 (and probably 3).  Takes too long with 4 or 5 when everyone is following your dice actions all the time.  Official solo play is quite lack-luster due to the swinginess of the dice-rolls, but there are a couple of fan-made variants (including one of my own) which work very nicely.

[b]Tiny Epic Galaxies[/b]

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]I did enjoy my one play, but there is something I just don’t like about the overall aesthetic of the Tiny Epic games which keeps me from seeking them out to play/buy. I’d be more tempted if it was a full sized game with better/larger components. In regards to TEG I’d much rather play Roll for the Galaxy which while different shares enough mechanically and thematically to scratch the same itch.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]I really enjoyed my play of TE Galaxies a lot more than the Kingdoms. Similar to a game like RftG because this game is definitely a race, you are trying to maximize your die rolls to capture planets and score points. The dice in work well, there is plenty you can do on your turn to mitigate luck (especially since you can burn energy to re-roll any number of dice as many times as you want). Most of the planet abilities offer you the ability to manipulate one aspect of the game, whether it be gaining a specific type of resource or helping you capture planets. I think it was an excellent decision for your opponents to also benefit from the planet actions, you always recieve more of a benefit but you need to be careful what the ramifications are to helping out your opponent(s).

I'm not sure whether this is a + or - but this game is definitely a filler. There are decisions to be made, but there is not a lot of variance in how the game will play out. There didn't seem to be radically different strategies, just slight tweaks in how you go about winning the game. Therefore for me it is a pass since I think the engine driving the game is similar to RftG or Roll and I'd rather play either of those games since they offer a lot more depth and variety in the way you go about building your engine (Race plays quicker, Roll may be a bit longer than Galaxies). That said if you are looking for a simpler engine building/race game I would recommend checking out TE Galaxies and I would definitely play again.[/i]

This is a great game. Mitigated Yahtzee with a bit of engine building. Components are great. I like the fact it is so tiny and love the little rocket meeples. The best mechanic is the 'follow' action which allows you to spend resources to copy an action on another player's turn; cuts down time down to zero.

Sets up fast and there is a solo variant in which it is difficult to accidentally cheat which I find the biggest problem with most solo games.

Cost me £20 at my FLGS in Stoke. Bargain.

These dice are beautiful and the gameplay is awesome.  It's a little flawed in that it really benefits you to throw almost all of your actions into taking down the big point planets, in order to rush the end of the game.  But, having some of the small planets can give you some nice colony powers.  I ALWAYS use the satellites and super weapon, which are a nice touch.  I also really enjoy the ability to use culture to follow other people's dice, and I like to play a strategy where I set 2 ships out on culture-yielding planets, and then every time someone activates a die to harvest culture, I spend a culture to follow, and gain 2.  It's a brilliant little bootstrapping scheme.  

Excited for the expansion.

My favorite of the three Tiny Epic games (Kingdoms and Defenders). This one has some elements of Eminent Domain, as you can follow other player's actions, but your actions are determined by dice rolls. Some may not like the dice part of it, but you get one re-roll and can set two dice aside to change the face of another. With those two options it seemed more often than not you had plenty of options for actions. The powers you get to use when landing on a planet (and after colonizing one) can create some interesting combos. It's a fun, fairly quick space game.

Rating of 8.5 based on solo play only.  As a solo game, this is one of the best.  There's a lot going on, and a lot to manage, but also tons of luck in the dice rolls.  Still feels strategic, however, because of the ways you can manipulate dice rolls.  AI feels like a real opponent, not an afterthought.  I really like the balancing of resources vs taking over planets, and the puzzle and balance of managing the AI (keeping it from upgrading, and making sure it's not taking more planets than you).  Then you add in planet abilities, and it gets even more fun and adds yet another layer to the game!  Outstanding solo experience!

The game plays fast so you definitely should think short term. You roll dice to be able to perform certain actions like move your ship to a planet or get energy or culture. Energy mainly lets you re-roll your dice while culture lets you copy another players action (follow as the game calls it). The only complication is the follow action as players must call out there actions to ensure others can use this privilege. A cute short game with some nice mechanics and thought to it.

RATING: 3.5
Interesting for a few plays, but not much beyond that.  I would not recommend this for more than 3 players as it will drag beyond what is reasonable for this.  The abiltities on the planets, though better than the incredibly dull Harbour, are still lackluster.  After a few plays, the game feels like nothing more than a collection of small to medium tracks where you get a few points when you reach the end of one.  I also have a feeling that when you realize the balance between colonizing planets and upgrading your empire, games of this will start to play out very similarly.  If you really want a small box game that involves expanding your territory, Eight Minute Empire and Eight Minute Empire: Legends are both vastly superior choices.

RATING: 7
Tiny Epic Galaxies is a Yahtzee-style dice-rolling game in which each die face rolled represents a different action that can be peformed.  Players can use resources to either upgrade their empire board, which can earn them more dice and ships, or use their ships to either use the special ability of planets or begin a longer process to claim those planets, which provides victory points and permanent access to those abilities.  There is also a mechanism by which you can re-use an action die that another player just used by spending a culture, which keeps people paying attention and gives people reason to try to set up a culture engine.  There were a few get-there-first issues with claiming planets, and some opportunities for take-that style play, but nothing too egregious.  On the whole, I found this to be a fairly entertaining dice filler.

RATING: N/A
Solid little game.  Decent player interaction.  Decent quality on the components (kickstarter edition has extra "flair").  I think that we will enlarge the "home planets" (player boards).  The tracks on the player boards are pretty "tight" and it's tough to put your ships and dice in the right places and keep them there.  So, enlarging the boards to the size of the box should help.  I liked the game play.  Helped to have Tim teach it.  He's patient and kept an eye out for the rest of us, especially for some of the rules that were not intuitive.  I like the "follow" mechanic (spend a "culture" to do the same action as one dice that a competitor uses).  It confused me that you could only do this once per player; but, I think that's a reasonable rule.  I think that the planets have abilities that could be used to some advantage (that one probably cannot master in a first game).  Overall, I'd give it a 7.4 or so.  Worth playing.  And, I would play it again.  But, I think I would rather play Contagion or Machi Koro before TEG, if I wanted to play a 30-40 minute game.  (I think this is "heavier" than either of those options, too.)

RATING: 7
Moderate complexity, plays quickly, the games are usually tight.  The around-the-table follow option slows down the pace. Solution: a house rule to eliminate the follow option in order to ensure the game moves along or just play it as a 2 or 3 player game. Terribly slow at 5 players.

玩了一場五人場，覺得三人場應該不錯玩XD ，也就是說，五人場是悲劇，為什麼呢?  因為"跟風做事"這件事，好玩也是因為它，悲劇也是因為它，當遊戲五人場的時候，跟風很重要，但因為跟風要花特定資源(文化點數)，導致五人場只有一種真正重要的資源叫作文化，全力拿不要降到零就對了，五人場卡片的占領也很難規劃，輪到自己看到哪裡空就採也沒啥好選而且搞不好還是會被攔胡劫走。若是三人場，可以想見即使偶爾缺文化點可能也可以用稍微好一點的骰運來平衡，卡片的占領也會比較順利，總之以後只想試三人場了。

Tiny Game but way to long. I was excited at the little box and a 30-45 minute game time it suggested. "Perfect" I thought. A fun filler game before we move into a bigger game........ 2.5 hours later.....after waiting 10 to 15 minutes between turns in a 5 player game before it was my turn to do what? Roll dice? Get some crappy rolls and wait another 10 minutes? Never again. Fiddly and tiny production value.

Nice, quick playing game of empire building. Lots of variety in planets and very interesting interaction amongst players with competition for targets and action following. Personally, I feel 21 points to trigger the game end is a tad low, at least when you can score up to 8pts just for developing your home world, which you'll always want to do anyway given it lets you roll more dice and gives you more ships, but that's easily house ruled if you like.

An uncomplicated ruleset and good components for a very portable game, which has the archetypal placement-game strategy of the-more-workers-the-better married to a big-points-equals-big-prizes feeling. One player just did not 'get' the rules, but that was an anomaly. Would not complain about playing again, but it suffered - like many dice games, especially placement ones - from taking too long for its depth. Not left starry-eyed.

In this game, you roll dice, and then you are allowed to take the actions printed on the dice. The game has two resourcetypes. Energy you use to move things around and culture you spend it to follow other player's actions. The actions mostly involve moving ships to activate planet abilities or putting the ships into these tracks, and when completed you tuck the planet into your board, giving one of your dice faces an extra option for what it can do. The limitation of your actions though the dice wasn't as interesting as I've seen it in other games, as spending energy to reroll is allowed as many times as you like. There's also a dumb little design flaw (feature?) where when someone takes the produce culture action, you can spend a culture to follow the action and then gain more culture. The game has a lot of take that, where you snatch planets out from under people who have spent turns building to be able to score them.

Look, planets! Roll some dice. Spend the dice. Reroll the dice. Land on a planet to activate its ability. Spend dice to race to buy a planet. Upgrade yourself for more dice and more ships. Get more resources. Eventually there is an endgame trigger.

This game... does a game pretty well?

It makes me think of a simpler version of Impulse meets a simpler version of Roll for the Galaxy. But doesn't really do either very well. For what it is it's not bad, but if you have to qualify something with a "for what it is" clause, then you've got a problem.

A filler style game with a push you luck element. You roll die and take the actions on the dice. Some allow to collect resources, move your ships to planets which you can activate to do what the card says or land on an occupation track. Other symbols improve your position on the track. so you can claim the planet for scoring. The city symbol allows you to use energy or culture to improve board to get more dice (crucial) and improve your score which seems gratuitous since you are getting extra dice. 
The push you luck element come from using energy to get rerolls. 
Culture can be used to follow another players dice which doesn't work as well since it bypasses the whole dice rolling mechanic so you can accomplish more other players turn than your own. Culture seems to drive the game., rather than the dice rolling mechanic. 
Playing to 21 makes some planets are way too strong, and not that much more expensive, having a third of the points from you card as you expend to get more dice which has it own value doesn't help the game

I can pass on it.

I agree with other fans:
“It has AIs of different difficulty level, the AI is quite easy to manage…
It has plenty of dice manipulation and combo making…
The production value is great and it's cheap…
It has small bits of worker placement. Generally not the AP inducing kind…
Variety of ‘enemies’ to play against- especially if you include the extra 5 found in the files area…
Small footprint. Likewise, it takes up a small amount of shelf space…”

I’ll add that I find the artwork of the planet cards beautiful, and the overall design clever and elegant.

I was hoping for big things with this game, and it is just average. I'm glad I got it because I can travel with it and it is still fun, but there is nothing here to write home about. The "follow" mechanic is probably the best part. I just really don't feel like I am building a space empire when I play it. Still a good game to pack with a couple of small games and play in a hotel. The game is just not big enough for twenty to thirty minutes of time. I would rather play Roll for the Galaxy or 7 Wonders Duel every time over this one if I have that amount of time for a game. The solo play is pretty good. One of the better solo games I've played. I will bump it up to a 7 because of the appeal for a travel game and for a solo game. Otherwise I would give it a 6.5. *** Wife:7

It is surprising how many agonizing decisions can come from a game with so few components. Everything from deciding whether or not to reroll, where to apply your dice, then in which order to apply them gives you infinite choices. This can open the game up to analysis paralysis, but overall it is very enjoyable. This goes for both the solo and standard play.

It took me four games but I've finally broken myself of buying the Tiny Epic games. The enthusiasm of the creators is infectious but none of the four that I got did anything special. Playing them feels not quite like a chore but definitely obligatory in a lot of ways. No one that I've introduced the games to has been excited about any of it - bland art, bland theme, bland components, bland mechanics. Tiny Epic Bland.

Area majority with no second place and amply room to avoid competition.  So, no interaction except for surprise surges of sniping, which is unforeseeable and unsatisfying.

Also, high variance dice.

And you can buy more actions, which you should always do and being lucky enough to do so quickly strongly correlates to victory.  Yes, the first thing you do is buy workers and the person who is best able to do so will win -- which can happen after just a few turns.

Many parts of the game are pleasing, but the core dynamics are fundamentally flawed.

the youtube show TableTop with WW had a lot to do with my friends and i getting into board gaming during/after college. our tastes have changed, but back then this game rearranged familiar elements such as boring dice in a way that made it feel like player decisions mattered. o, brave new world! although there are random elements and some "take-that" in the mix, overall this is a quick, portable, engaging game. it allows for strategies which opens up narratives of exploration, upgrades, copy-cat-piling-on, zooming success, and choking loss. all those things with barely time for someone to pull their cellphone out. i'd certainly recommend this game! having said that, please don't take a recommendation of THIS tiny epic game to be a recommendation for ALL the tiny epic series. i learned that lesson slowly. anyway, this one is a favorite for traveling, although i suppose it could quickly be replaced by acquiring Race for the Galaxy, assuming only that the in-laws would accept the less swingy, more thinky, harder to learn game. hmm. it could happen. until then i'll just keep this around.

Scales up badly, 2-3 players only. Following others is interesting in theory but adds a lot of playing time in practice. Very random with 6 different die sides, initial turns very important. Trading dice uses up 3 to get one (with initial 4 dice). Lots of different special effects on planets, but many not interesting enough to ever use. Difficult to see what others are doing. Empire track too dominant. Bonus cards unbalanced and uninteresting. Empire 8vp, plus one planet 6-7vp, is almost all you need for a 21vp victory. Very hard to do any meaningful interaction, requires looking very closely at other players cards.

Very different and much better than TE Kingdoms.  There's much less attacking/take that - basically just sometimes a players will jump in on a planet you're trying to capture and pass you on the capture track.

Excellent fun. Lots of decisions what to go for, how to get there, where to compete head to head and what to risk. It plays quickly and keeps you engaged, even when it's not your turn. I think it's a very clever design. The best dice game I've seen this year. Better than Discoveries, better than Nations: The Dice Game, better than Roll Through The Ages: The Iron Age... maybe even better than Roll for the Galaxy. What I especially like is that it's a small box game packing a big punch. Enjoying it immensely.

The only issue we've encountered is that culture is so essential in a multiplayer game that you'll sell your mother to land or orbit your ships on and around culture planets. This can get rather funny when there's only a couple of culture planets available and people are getting kicked off them as they're colonised. Odd, but still fun. The culture-follow mechanic works great with two players, but starts to break down as you increase the player count - especially above three. I'm wondering whether a rule tweak with five players might make a better game of it - a maximum of two follows on another player's turn perhaps? Or a two culture follow cost with four or five players (with the opponents two cost follow planet ability getting a corresponding bump to three culture)? I hate tweaking rules, but in this case the game might be better for it.

Similar in a few ways to the other "Tiny Epic" game I have played (Kingdoms), but different in a lot of ways, I thought Galaxies was good. I found myself wishing there were more ways to manipulate the dice values other than just a re-roll and the "sacrifice 2" option (which I didn't employ when I probably should have). The planet cards present good ways to change the play based on what strategies you choose. And the follow actions present good choices. Nothing really stands out and shines compared to other things I have played before, but it is a good mix of ingredients I have tasted before.

My very first KS game lured by the low pledge cost and tons of stretch goals. There's a lot of quality wooden pieces packed in a tiny box. As the name suggests, it's a 'Tiny' game, microgame, rather. Gameplay is solid and has components specifically designed for solitaire play, but it's very light on the mechanics. Makes a very fine filler or portable game that can be played rather quickly.

Worker Placement game with a sci-fi theme.

Pro: Light mechanics but still extremely engaging - knowing if a decision that helps both you and your opponents is worth it in the long run; despite this, very little analysis-paralysis - mitigated by the fact actions are dice-based. Nice play-time, especially given the small size of the box; not a micro-game, and yet doesn't overstay its welcome like many other sci-fi games. Interesting solitaire mode, as well. Not too many symbols and icons to memorize, and all are labelled clearly on a global mat. Components are nice. Price point is perfect. Very high replay value.

Con: Typically sci-fi fans are heavy strategists, and dice rolling may put them off - nitpicking at best.

Best of the "tiny epic" series that I played, although I am not a huge fan of this game. The game takes way too long with 4 players as you cannot plan your turn ahead of time. Following other player's action makes you somewhat involved while other player's play their turn, but culture points are too limited that you won't be paying attention to other player's turn all that much.

I really enjoyed this dice placement game a lot more than the other folks I played with did. The rules are a little complicated, especially with more players as the follow mechanic really kicks into gear. I thoroughly enjoyed the mitigation systems in place to keep you from getting too badly screwed by your original roll, and loved how the follow mechanic prevents there from really being any downtime (assuming you had culture to spend). The race to capture planets was a little too stressful for some, but I liked it.

Ah, what can I say?  TEG is a small dice-rolling game with a space theme that carries a BIG punch.  The wooden components (spaceships, culture/energy markers, empire upgrade) are solid and functional.  The game play is rather quick, and is fantastic whether multi-player or solo against the Rouge Galaxy (I played it both ways).  Cards serve as planets that contain either energy or culture.  Dice facing can either be energy, culture, diplomacy, economy, movement, or event.  You need energy for extra re-rolls; culture to "follow" or copy an opponents action; either to upgrade your empire to gain more dice and victory points.  Roll diplomacy or economy, and you can advance on planets with those tracks if you landed there.  Be the first to reach the end of a planet's track and gain its victory points and its special action.  The player who reaches 21 or higher wins (after a complete round of play). I haven't yet played Defenders nor Kingdoms so cannot do a comparison; however, I am hearing that each game in the series is different but Galaxies is by far the best.

RATING: 7.5
Fun "heavy filler" style game where you get to build up your space empire. I actually like it better than Tiny Epic Kingdoms. I think it's that the interaction is more frequent, as the planets are in a common pool from you to choose. I like how you're building and customizing your empire, and I enjoy how the dice dictate your actions.

This game really didn't work for me.  It's light, practically filler, highly random with forced "choices" dictated by the dice making for dull, robotic turns.  This is exacerbated by the fact EVERYONE is doing stuff on everyone else's turns, but the actions are obvious most of the time.  Yet inexplicably, despite having options on everyone else's turns, the game seems to encourage a whole lot of gazing off into space by disengaged players.  How very odd.

For a filler-type game that's highly luck driven, it's a steep learning curve with lots of symbols, odd interactions, crap to balance and remember, etc.  Furthermore, the visual design is a mess -- cards are hard to read, the player board is confusingly laid out and non-intuitive...

... But worst of all, unforgivable, is that this game advertises itself as a 30 minute play time for up to 5 players.  Our 5 player game took over 2 hours.  With seasoned, savvy gamers.  That's ridiculous.  I thought I was sitting down for a quick game before we moved on to something beefier, and we ended up stuck on this thing for 2 hours.  Bummer.

Having said all of this... there are good ideas here.  There might even be a good game here.  But it needs polish, more playtesting.  It needs editing!

I've played two other "Tiny Epic" games before this.  Kingdoms, which I really disliked, even with the expansion that was supposed to fix many of the problems I initially had with it.  And Western, which I enjoyed but despite enjoying it I have a hard time seeing why I would play a game with this form factor over a standard sized board game.  I don't travel with board games very often, at least not where a standard board game box is too inconvenient.

That's kind of where I landed with this one.  It was a fine game.  It is played sort of like a Yahtzee variant with tableau building.  Each round you roll a set number of dice and use them to colonize planets, increase your resources, and upgrade your colony.  This goes on until a certain point total is reached.  There was nothing wrong with it but in a larger package it could be so much better.  So despite enjoying it I can only get so enthusiastic about what seems like a watered down experience.

RATING: 5.5
Good, family-weight dice and resource-management game with a solid solitaire variant. Each turn, a player rolls a number of dice and activates them one by one. A move symbol allows a ship to move to a planet card, which can either be activated for its special ability or orbited; two other symbols allow progressing on a planet's orbit track, with the first to reach the end colonizing it for VP. Two further symbols grant 1 energy or culture per ship on or orbiting energy/culture planets. Finally, the last symbol allows either upgrading the home colony (for more dice, ships and VP) or using the special ability, now exclusive, of a previously colonized planet.

Energy can also be spent to re-roll dice, while culture can be spent to perform the same action as another player on their turn.

There are a number of choices to make but it should come as no surprise that luck plays a significant role. Getting the right results to allow a plan to come together is necessary for success. It's also utterly themeless, and without the strategic variation of, say, Roll Through the Ages, but as far as family games go you could do worse. I think it mostly plays itself and would not recommend it to strategic players.

TEG includes reasonable solitaire rules (the back of each player mat features slightly different AI players) but AI performance is too highly contingent on random dice order for it to hold any interest.

Dice based game.
Where dice don't give the actions that you DO, but the potential outcome.

Furthermore the entropy is controllable.
It is up to you how much you will invest in having more dice to throw or how much re-rolls you can do, which throws this game from the luck-based games into the strategy (probability calculation) games.

I do like it a lot.

It has the word that is THE best of the tiny epic series, but I haven't played the others so i can not confirm that.

Tiny? Well, it's pretty small but not exactly tiny. Epic? Definitely not. Galaxies? Yes, and I like having five different solo cards to play against, which are fun to try out but despite the planet deck doesn't offer much replayability since you end up applying the same strategy after you figure out how to win. Would have liked the player mats to be larger because it's very to bump them and mix up your stats. Overall, this looks and feels like a much more interesting game than it ends up being when you play it.

I want to try the additional Rogue galaxies available as PnP.

RATING: N/A
Unsure about this one. It comes highly recommended by all major reviewers. However, the main draw-in of this game is its quick engine-building part drive by dice rolling, supported by the "follow" mechanic akin to Puerto Rico/Glory to Rome/Race for the Galaxy. 

I don't mind dice rolling in my game, but not for fueling an engine. I like them for 'making the best out of my turn' i.e. tactical use. In here, these dice are needed to bump your overall strategy. I like them in War of the Ring, I like them in King of Tokyo. Here? Hmm. It feels like you can get hosed by dice-rolling only to see other players engines start to take off. I wonder if its not very clear in mid-game who is going to be the winner, thereby killing off any excitement from the last part of the game.

Also, the theme still feels generic: yes, I have ships, but other than that I'm just moving to action spots which I can also invest in to take them for myself, allowing my workers.. pardon.. ships to have more choice. I can get more dice & workers by investing along a track, which seems like an absolute no-brainer. There is no area control in this game, no hidden exploration, only engine manipulation.

Like RftG, some people really dig that. For me, I like a couple of surprises along the way, in the past these engine building-type games always have become stale after a while. Writing this three years past the initial release, I really do wonder if this game still gets playtime. Also wonder about the AP in this game, endangering one of its main benefits: the short play-time.

For me: definitely a 'try before I buy' type of game. As I haven't tried it yet, the verdict is still out.

I haven't played any of the other Tiny Epic games yet, so I can't compare them and I have no idea how similar they are outside of the box size and the similar title.
In this game you roll dice to perform actions to improve your tech and acquire planets. And to score points of course. It all works pretty nicely. I think the balance between game length and depth is well done.

A large part of the appeal of Tiny Epic Galaxies is the juxtaposition of large and small.  The concepts and meeples really help make this fun little dice game seem like quite a bit more than the sum of it's few components, parameters, and variables.  At this scale it is adorable, but out of a huge box and with full size elements, it would seem somehow less inventive. It would be cool to have a magnetized version, since this seems well suited for plane and train and (of course) space travel.

I kickstarted and was disappointed by [thing=148951][/thing].  So I passed on Galaxies, although my friend backed it and I got to give it a try.  The game play is actually decent.  It has a lot of things in common with other dice games and you try to claim planets that are worth different points and provides you with different powers.  You get more ships and more dice as the game goes on.

I do have two complaints about the game.  First, is that the game suffers from being so tiny.  It's hard to move the pieces and read the cards, and would benefit greatly from being a regular sized game.  It's not like you would play it at a bar or restaurant anyway.  Second, one of the resources (culture) allows you to follow the other players' actions, ala Race or Roll for the Galaxy.  In this game, that is very powerful and I'm pretty sure a culture-heavy strategy would always win.

It's not a bad game, but I'm pretty much done with the Tiny Epic series.

Really bad game, a lot of issues here.

For one, it's really lazy these days to make a dice game that just uses a Yahtzee mechanic. Games like Roll for the Galaxy and Discoveries are finding new, interesting ways to use dice. Tiny Epic Galaxies just lets you roll, reroll, then spend energy to roll more if you choose. After that, you're just stuck with whatever you've got. It's very easy to roll two or three times and still not be able to make any good moves because of the luck of the dice. Frustrating.

It also seems like if you get behind then there is no possible way to catch up. I'm fine with a game not having a strong catch-up mechanic, but in a game where you're at the mercy of the dice [i]and[/i] there is no catch-up mechanic, it's just frustrating. You opponents will have more dice to roll, more resources, and more special abilities. Meanwhile you're just rolling a few dice and hoping that you get something useful.

It seemed like a good idea, but this is the weakest Tiny Epic game so far.

The different solo modes interest me and it could be a nice game for pub evenings with the guys, because we are all scifi affine there. Not that much chance to play with my wife, though, because scifi is not in her comfort zone. The game has a kind of race for the galaxy feel, but is simpler to teach. My first solo plays were enjoyable and not too fiddly, so this will surely get more plays over time.

1 play, 3 player. Felt very strategic and tense.  More than once someone said "No!  Don't go there!" in a fun way.  Every move was a difficult decision, not through lack of options, but in maximizing your turn without benefiting your oponents using culture to follow you and doing better on your turn than you did on your own.  I really like that aspect of which order to do your actions and paying attention to the other players.
I could see this suffer from AP, it didn't in our game, but I was playing with people that don't have that problem.

Factoring in the price, the size and the easy of entry - this is an abnsolute masterpiece. A lot of fun - I can teach folks this in 5 minutes and we're all done with a fulfilling experience after 30 min. This game is just wonderfully efficient with your time, money and space. Excellent. 

So far I've found a few minor things that I'm wondering a bit about - the facts that some planets get more points for less effort. It could lead to a bit of "And now I take it all and you can nothing" situations where everyone goes for the same planet, but it hasn't been an issue yet. Also, some of the planets could have a bit more interesting actions to provide some more variety from play to play. 

Overall amazing value for money and space!

The best in the "epic" series. Excellent game for about 1 hour for 4 people. Great marriage of dice action selection and minimize downtime (follow another's player action by paying culture). It is an hour of game play that all players are involved in almost all the time. Great design. if you want to have a 20 min game, just eliminate the "follow" option, but the game loses so much of its character. I hope the same concept can be applied to an Epic Mega Galaxy game. This game deserves a mega brother!

RATING: 6
Tiny Epic Galaxies is a dice rolling space civilization game. In the game you're sending spaceships to various planets trying to colonize them for points. Alternatively each planet can be visited for a special effect.

Through most of the game, you're trying to accumulate culture and energy. Those can be spent to upgrade your civiliation which gives you extra spaceships, dice and points. Alternatively you can spend culture to follow someone else's action. You can spend energy to reroll dice (after your one free reroll).

Planets come in different flavors. They are either a culture planet or a power planet. And they are either a planet that can be colonized by diplomacy or economically.

The actions on the dice you roll are:

Upgrade civilization/Use colonized planet special Power
Take power from all the places your ship is at
Take culture from all the places your ship is at
Advance on an economic colonization
Advance on a diplmoatic colonization
Send a spaceship somewhere

When you use a die, every other player after you has the option to spend a culture to follow your action.

The game is interesting. I didn't like it with five players. I got in a culture bind and couldn't get culture very effectively for the last three rounds of the game. Which meant I couldn't follow anyone's actions. Towards the end of the game, people were aware that the game end was coming near and were trying to make the best of their final turns. And with nothing else to do with energy, there were a lot of rerolls using energy to try and get the best dice.

Turns really slowed down. I could tell after my last turn that the end game trigger would happen that round and that I wouldn't get another turn. And with no culture, I had nothing to do while the other four players thought through their turns and tried to maximize their scores and eke out every possible point. The follow mechanism is interesting, but if you're not involved in it, then it makes for some long turns.

One issue with the game is culture deficits. If you get stuck in a position without culture, you can't follow actions which means, you get to do fewer things... and that can be fairly punishing. The way around this is to park your spaceships on culture worlds and follow culture actions to get multiple culture (spend 1 culture to follow, and get 2 or possibly 3 culture from all the culture worlds with your ships.)

That works until the worlds you are on suddenly get colonized. When planets get colonized your spaceships get sent home... and your home world is a power planet. If you get stuck with only 1 spaceship (or none) on a culture world, it's dangerously easy to get stuck in a position where you can't get culture easily. Not having culture essentially means you can zone out on other player's turns as there's nothing for you to do.

The game felt long with five. That's probably because I played poorly and from about halfway though the game had no culture... after which I spent most of my time just watching other people play.

RATING: 7
[thing=163967][/thing] is neat: the dice offer a fine amount of options and decisions. The goal is to advance your technologies and conquer planets, using for this dice, as a way to get energy, movement, culture (to follow the an action done by someone else) and other things, such as activating special abilities, in order to get as much advantage as possible, as there will be a good deal of fighting for planets, since two or more players can want the same one.

There is little direct agression, thus, the difficulty in getting what you want stays on the dice, as many times they might not cooperate, but the mechanics allow for rolling extra times and/or use two dice to get one result of any kind. Therefore, normally players will be able to do what they want, just maybe not precise or fast enough.

In the end, although [thing=163967][/thing] isn't heavy on strategy, is necessary to be able to prioritize and seize opportunities, since timming counts for a lot in order to not fall behind, or be swindled by the action of other player. [thing=163967][/thing] isn't sensational - specially in 2 players, where it lacks interaction and tension -, but is pleasant, highly portable, and being easy to teach and play, alonside having a short playing time (around 45 minutes), it naturally becomes a game that can hit tables often.

{KS] Best of the Tiny Epic games, IMO. Offers a surprising amount of both strategic and tactical play for such a small box. Avoids the 'multiplayer solitaire' problem with the 'follow' mechanic, which forces you to be careful with your moves lest your opponent copy your actions to their advantage or your detriment. 
Pro tip: try to have at least two ships on planets that give Culture in order to gain one by following anyone else who takes it.

This is a 10 solo. But I have to bump it down for multi player. Because it can cause player paralysis (me included), I have friends who will never play this again. Actually, there's a certain combo that I think I'll take out of the game - it leads to an in-turn engine that to calculate the permutations makes the brain hurt, and yet can completely change the winner no matter the point differential.

Everyone in my family would rate this a 10.  It's not really a 10 in terms of unbiased review.  It's fun; I mean, it's really fun.  But once you learn how to play it, there are elements to this game which you can just abandon in order to win, and they're not enough to boost your opponents to victory.  If this game wasn't a "blast" to play, (the following mechanic does a lot for this game) then it would be a 6 rating.

Many consider this the best Tiny Epic game. I've only played two and I prefer Kingdoms...simply because while this may be a better game overall in terms of complexity and the follow up options are cool, when I play a tiny game like this I am looking for something simpler. When I want more complexity I gravitate towards deeper games. The solo play is one advantage this one has though. Have not tried it much yet.

I had a hard time feeling engaged in Tiny Epic Galaxies during my first play of it (with four players). I thought the game was a little bit too chaotic, and most of all too long for what it offered. Since then, however, I have been playing a couple of 2-player games, and each game is better than the last (up to the point where I now frequently suggest it - especially when we only have time to play a game that takes less than an hour). The game offers interesting decisions with every throw of the dice, and the level of interactivity is just right for me. It really puts other dice-y games of comparable length to shame.

Possibly the best of the "Tiny Epic" series thus far, continuing the tradition of juuuuuust enough mechanics to make a small game feel big, but not enough to overstuff the design. The higher probability of the design leading to heads-down optimization deducts a few points from an otherwise stellar game, as the engine building/race elements fit together very well.

Galaxies takes similar mechanics from Tiny Epic Kingdoms and improves on them. Role selection is randomized through dice but mitigated by thoughtful options. Furthermore, it erases TEK's race to technology option which was a do or die when we played. TEG gives points for doing the "same" but does not have it trigger the end game. Nicely done.

Feel like this game was heavily over-hyped. The person teaching it to me originally billed it as Alien Frontiers-lite.  That got me excited as a I'm a big fan of that... but then the game took as long as Alien Frontiers, if not longer.  Why wouldn't I just play a more interesting and complex game? It's a nice small package, but that's it's only merit.  It also reminded me of Eminent Domain and Rol for the Galaxy, but both of those play much quicker and offer a richer experience.

The game more or less plays itself based off your dice roll, you have very little control of it.  I wish the planet powers were more interesting like the  tech's in Alien Frontiers, but most are pretty straight forward and you  might not even be able to use them.  Culture is hugely powerful since there is zero drawback to following actions.  This all amounts to your one goal being farming Culture and just cashing in free actions on every other players turn.

Pretty forgettable.

Lots to think about in a small package.  It's not better than some of the other games in this space, like [gameid=98351] or [gameid=132531], but it's small packaging means its more portable and takes up less shelf space.  I will admit that I wish some of the components were a little bit bigger -- they work, but there would have been utility in bigger card text and more space to make the player mats a little clearer.  But all things considered, this is a nice, fast space race game.  You can do a lot worse.

I enjoyed this micro-sized game as it offers plenty of replay value as each player attempts to become the premier empire colonising and mining newly discovered planets. Each player starts with an identical colony which they must expand out into the reaches of space and look to develop the five planets to choose from. They may either land planet side and action the ability that accompanies each planet or attempt to subvert it and bring into a particular empire be progressing along a separate track. This may be  a culture or power track for instance, and in order to take actions, each player rolls a set of dice. The more advanced the culture, the more dice they throw, and potentially puts them in a better position to reach or exceed the target score of 21. I am sure this can be adjusted with prior agreement to make longer or shorter games. A good game that I would recommend.

This little box of awesome might give Roll for the Galaxy a run for its money. Gorgeous dice, beautifully illustrated cards and slick gameplay reminiscent of Glory to Rome and Impulse. Like Harbour, another of Scott Almes' micro-game tributes to big complex Euros, Tiny Epic Galaxies hits all the notes of a big 4x game, but does it with a few cards and some dice. It's not the same as playing something like Eclipse and certainly doesn't replace it...but if you've only got a half hour to work with, it certainly gives you a taste of Eclipse. And seriously, those dice are an absolute work of art.

I’m not sure why I keep doing it, but I’m always on the look out for good fillers, so I decided to pick up Tiny Epic Galaxies after hearing good reviews of it. I’ve only played it once solo, but I think I like what I see. It has dice that allow you to do certain actions and you get to re-roll them once for free. From there, it’s a matter of using those dice to launch ships, colonize planets, upgrade, use your new planet actions, and acquire resources.

This is not epic in any way, but from what I can tell, it looks like it’ll be fun with a few folks before everyone else shows up to the game night. It’s just a quick few die rolls and I’d guess you’re done in about 30-45 minutes. I’m looking forward to trying it with my group.

Love this game. Easy to play and fast. I Kickstarted it so I have the deluxe version.
The 2 things I did not like were the home planet cards are too small. I scanned them and sized them up to the box size and printed them on cards stock. Then sprayed them with a clear gloss coat to seal them. Much more room now to place you tokens and ships.
The other was no score tracker. I printed the one out from the free download on BGG. It helps a lot while you are playing so you don't have to ask each player how many points they have.
I would have given the game a higher score if they had just done those 2 things. Other than that this game is solid and I would highly recommend it.

Well, the box doesn't lie: this game has tiny components. Still, it packs a good punch. You're trying to get to 21 victory points by expanding your empire (getting more dice and rockets to perform actions with), and by saving up for cards in the middle of the table that also have special abilities. Nothing groundbreaking, but small and entertaining enough if you're on the move and play time is limited.

Mini 4X with cards and dice in space that packs a lot of game in less than an hour. Dice rolling action system from the tiny epic series. After a few plays it still seems swingy even with cool anti-swingy measures built in to get what you need with dice conversion, re-rolls, and come from behind planet abilities. But, we don't mind luck of the dice as Ameritrashers. Player turns can run a little long but Eminent Domain style "follow" actions keep the other players engaged even though this makes the turns run a little longer. There are some take-that planets but doesn't seem too aggressive. I like that planets can be tucked to save table space. Cool to see how a game system can be tweaked and implemented across different genres.

This game has everything I like. It is fast, you can make a lot of decisions and the best player with the best timing wins. If you use the expansion the game has more length and losse it's speed (the mechanisms of the expansion are great but I like faster gameplay)

A space opera where the dice over-emote and stare helplessly into the camera.  The languid cast:

Racy Blaze as [i]Culture Iz OP[/i]

I would go on, but I'd rather plan how to decorate my spaceship with your carcass.

Have I already said that this game was wonderful? We buy it because it was supposed to be a good little game. And we have discovered a small box, with a great game inside. Simple mechanisms with good decisions making and nice little twist to mitigate the randomness of the dice. The designers have really achieved something, it is always a pleasure to play it.

There is a lot more in this box than you would expect. The dice play works very well and there are a good amount of planets to increase variety. Since there is a follow mechanic I definitely think this game is much better with 3-4 than 2, but it still does play okay with 2. Once things get moving games should fall in the 30-45 minute range but there is plenty of room for AP. Now that I've played a 5-player game I can safely say: avoid it.

Fairly simple to play, and the follow mechanism provides a cool way to keep players interested in what others are doing. I do wish there was a bit more hidden scoring, because it's quite apparent who's winning throughout the game.

Played at Essen (2015). This is a science-fiction space exploration, colonization card game. The game really is tiny for the huge galaxy it creates and it only cost 22 euros (at the fair).
 
In the galaxies there are two resources: energy and culture. We played until one of us reached 10 points which took about 30-40 minutes. A standard game would be to 20 or more points. The beginning wasn't very smooth and it took me a moment to grasp the rules.

During your turn you role a number of dice (starting with 4, upgrades can get you up to 7 dice). The symbols you role represent what you can do in your turn. The die results are: upgrade your empire or use your colonized planets' special ability, collect energy, or culture, move a rocket to a planet, or colonize a planet where you have a presence with either diplomacy or armies.

The dice can be re-rolled or two dice can be used to create one of any of the results to mitigate the randomness.

You gain victory points for upgrading your empire or completely colonizing planets.

Tiny Epic Galaxies is a short game that plays well with two and three players. I've found it very gently teaches the worker-placement concept to my family and friends that are familiar with Yahtzee and Monopoly, and I have been using it to bridge the 'euro gap'. The Culture resource allows all players on the board to stay involved off-turn and the planet deck insures a fairly unique game each play. It's not the game I always reach for, but I'm hard pressed to turn it down.

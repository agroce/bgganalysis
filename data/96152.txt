Tough game to enjoy first play but plenty of mechanics here for repeated different private archives and public archives selections. Have to be very aggressive in your play so that the theme comes through - so unfair to right this game off after just one play.

RATING: 6
I haven't played the basic Nightfall game, so if you're a Nightfall owner looking for an expansion, keep in mind that this is the review of somebody who hasn't played the basic game, and hasn't played the two sets together:

Another deckbuilder, but with a Magic-esque combat mechanic instead of a VP-card-collection win condition.  This is a nice change from Dominion and Thunderstone, but also means that there is a gang-up-on-the-winner effect.  Perhaps an attack-left houserule is in order?

Like Thunderstone, AEG's card quality continues to disappoint (though probably a little less so than Thunderstone), even more so when combined with the decent artwork.

The defining mechanic of Nightfall is the chain, where you can play any number of cards each turn, and again on each opponent's turn, but subject to the restrictions in the chain; each card indicates which type(s) of cards can be played next.  

Sometimes this feels like an interesting mechanic, where the value of a card is dependent not only on how you build your deck, but also on how your opponent builds their deck, and you want certain cards to be last in your chain, and so on.  However, at other times it feels like the whole thing makes the game much more luck-dependent, as there is only a buy pool of 10 cards, including 2 that are exclusive to each player, so if somebody else manages to snag a pair of decent chainable cards (with the drafting setup phase that leaves much to be desired), you may just be out of luck, as a really successful chain could result in a single game-determining turn.  When I make up my mind about this, Nightfall will probably gain or lose a point or two.

Which brings me to my next issue with Nightfall.  The single game-determining turn always comes out of nowhere.  Because the cards are all fairly cheap (imagine playing Dominion if every unused card was also a Silver and you always had unlimited buys), after turn 3 or so, you have a few copies of whatever you want, and anyone's deck could "go off" on any turn.  You're given a single round to try to throw down some blockers, but unless you get a similarly ridiculous round, it's likely you'll gain 30 wounds and end the game with you in dead last.  There is no slow buildup like in Thunderstone or Dominion, no slow progression where you go from the development stage of the game to the victory stage of the game, only a sudden, massive beatdown.

A solid expansion/standalone version of Nightfall, I will primarily be using it mixed together with the core game and the other expansions that I inevitably pick up. Not quite as strong as the first, but it's a welcome addition. The more variation I can draft, the better.

Aims to be Dominion with less strategy but more player interaction which sounds great but unfortunately it falls short of this lofty goal.  This game is just too light to keep me interested although it does have some neat concepts.

Take a core concept from MTG with summoning creatures that all have trample damage that generally disappear into your discard pile on their next turn, add a very intuitive colour-based chaining system that other players can join in to and influence after the active player has finished with their plays (and subsequently the active player can continue) that also rewards additional bonuses if cards are chained with a certain colour combination and you have the most interactive and tightest deckbuilders I've had the pleasure of playing.

Plays are counted in the first set.

I liked the cards in this set, but didn't see why they had to be included in a new expansion instead of the base game.  The martial law wounds changed nothing for my game; we still just discarded them for more cards at the end of the round rather than use their special text.

RATING: 7
This is a lot more combo heavy than the original, you can do some pretty schnacky things with this.

The bubble has burst a little bit on this. I still love it but the boyfriend has cooled on this and so we haven't played in a while, hence not owning more expansions/Promo's.

RATING: 8
I rated the base game an 8.5, and this one slightly less since it is a stand alone game, and I would prefer to be able to buy the new cards without gaining the starting hands and wounds which I already own. 

Also there is a new mechanism called Feeding (certainly appropriate for Zombies) which appears in some chain text and kickers and is the cost of allowing the effect to take place.  The idea is clever, but complicates the game in a way that doesn't improve the game. 

I like the new cards because it refreshes the game.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (October 2014)

A fascinating take on the deckbuilding genre. Nightfall is a very aggressive game, but I enjoy it. It took me a long time to play it because, for some reason, I’m suspicious of AEG´s games but the game is good. It works only for two players though, with more it degenerates into king making, chaotic and luck prone situations. It also increases the game length by a lot. I won’t play it with more than 2 players.

The rules are easy to explain, it adds very few new rules to the game, but the new cards are VERY welcomed. The variability was badly need and mixing both games is great.

 The art is good and I enjoy the theme.

Bottom line, Nightfall: Martial Law is a very good expansion to have if you enjoy Nightfall. It adds lots of needed variability and I want to explore it further. I also want to buy more expansions for the game.

Played for only half an hour. Wasn't intuitive in any way, really needed a narrative. I mean, the chains make no sense except as an abstract mechanism. (I know what they're trying to make it do, it just doesnt make much sense). Can get talked into giving it another try though

Update: I did try it again a couple of times, but its just too booring and nonsensical

RATING: 7.5
Playing this game was a pleasant surprise. The game borrows some mechanics from [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/36218/dominion]Dominion[/url] and [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/463/magic-gathering]MTG[/url] and mixes it all up with a new mechanic called chaining: each cards has two possibilities to play a new cards on top of it, creating a LIFO queue. This results in some interesting choices. Will you add a card to the chain or keep it for influence (resource for buying) later on. During deck-building which card will you buy for some nice chain combo's when combined with your own or opponents decks. This game has direct confrontation that can easily result in leader bashing, I need to play more to see how bothersome this will be for me. I concur that the theme and artwork is nicely done, but the whole dark vampire and werewolf craze doesn't do anything for me.

Played this with 2 buddies who love it and have spent a lot of money for the basic game and its expansions. I didnt like it all because it reminds me a lot the 'King' Magic the Gathering and i d rather play that than nightfall or play 7 wonders if i want the draft mechanism or dominion if i wanna build my deck. It needs a dedicated group to play nightfall and i m not one of them, besides i have many other boardgames that are waiting to hit the table.

I've really wanted to keep this deckbuilder, but after playing it with the Blood Country and Martial Law expansions, there are too many flaws of the game for it to be enjoyable.

There are several balance issues with some of the cards and the entire game revolves nabbing two or three cards.  Once you get these cards, you simply combo through them every single time.

It doesn't matter what type of cards on the table, someone will eventually find a combo and will just use it endlessly. 

Also, the game has a huge kingmaker problem.

Traded it away for Draconis Invasion.

This expansion brings with it new cards and a new kind of wound but all-in-all feels kind of lazy and empty.  The only new mechanic is the feed mechanic which allows you to perform an action to repeat a card in your chain's effect (like kicker effects only you can do feed effects as many times as you are able to perform the detailed action).

New content is always good, I just wish they did more to make it feel different.  The mechanic doesn't change up gameplay at all and the rest of the cards feel very same-y to what was already available in the base game.

A fairly mindless exercise in group-think, bash-the-leader and king-making. You do a whole bunch of Dominion-like deck-building stuff, but none of it really matters. All that really matters here is which players decide to gang up on which other players. I truly don't see the appeal here ...

Some good new cards - together with the base game, the options get a lot richer.

Still not a game I like - the chains are nice, a really great and inovative mechanic -, but the way the attacks happen and the way one player can totally screw other only because they think one player is ahead, or just because:
"Hey, you attacked me last round"
"Yes, but he did also, three times in a row!"
"No matter!"

Anyway, not a game for all tastes, but I can enjoy a play now and then.

The emphasis on in-play effects is nice, and the new wound mechanic can make for some brutal damage output, especially with the high strength minions from this set. 

Promos notwithstanding, there are only a few cards that do not have 2 potential kickers between both sets.

The game still plays a bit like the unholy offspring of Dominion and Munchkin, but it's as balanced as the players make it.

It's a little bit "more of the same," and a little bit "add a new thing or two to the mix," wrapped up in a whole lot of "add new cards to make the game different."  There's nothing wrong with any of that (it's exactly what Donald is doing with Dominion), but if the base game isn't really all that engaging to me, then the expansion (yes, yes, this is a "base game," too, but I'm still calling it an expansion because I bought this one second) won't be, either.  It's really a shame, because the game mechanisms seem interesting enough and different enough from other deck-builders to make an impact on me, but it just doesn't.

I've never played original Nightfall, so I'm rating this as a standalone, not as an expansion.

This is the first deckbuilder I've played other than Dominion that I can justify holding on to. It feels much deeper than Dominion, in that there are more things to consider in terms of deck construction. There also aren't really card archetypes in the same way, so knowing the specific cards seems to be a great benefit. Understanding what your opponent is doing is also very important; even if there is a "killer combo" on the board, finding it won't help if your opponent can get a good chain off of your turn.

After one 2-player game, I would say it's about on par with Dominion. After more plays, I could even see myself liking it more.

I do hate the theme, though.

Ranked higher than Nightfall because the addition of the extra cards adds so much extra depth to the game.

This game hit it and quit it faster than a james brown song.  And not in a good way.  Good riddance

Rating the same as the base game for now. Feed mechanic looks like a good addition but we have very little exposure to this set for now.

This is an both a expansion and a standalone game.

As an expansion it give more card ... and that a good thing. The game really need that. It doesn't add much new stuff, but I like the new wound cards and the feed mechanic.

As a standalone game it doesn't make much sense for me.

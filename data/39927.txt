RATING: 8
Another excellent economic/train game which, being a Yorkshireman, is obviously a bit closer to my heart than the Lancastrian (spit) setting that is Brass or the typical AoS map that could, in truth, be anywhere. My one reservation (other than the monstrosity of the map) relates to the replay value because although the goods and passengers are seeded differently each time, I suspect that the geography of the map itself means there are some standard routes that will always get built so the danger is that it may become a bit samey – and we really don’t want additional maps because Last Train to Camembert just doesn’t sound right.

Final version played at Birmingham Expo 2009

The terrain (mountains and valleys) dictate where the tracks can be laid and the two main railways need to buy your tracks in an interesting and novel system. You need to maintain influence over these two rialwyas, have enough train building acpaity and deal with the Government protesters about rail expansion.

I really liked the need for takeovers, the bidding system for more influence and the use of the different trains to transport passengers and freight. Another clever system from a designer at the height of his powers.

The component is very poor for colorblind people.

Careless and negligent components design make the great game becomes a trash.

For gaming, the game setup is too long and annoying.

By the historical fan, require the historical fact sheet why this is the last train. (Not let them search from Wikipedia)

Strongly prefer [gameid=37387] instead but this game has a value for replaying if being convinced.

Tenative rating based upon one play.  As mentioned by others, setup takes a bit, but other than that, there doesn't seem to be a lot of downtime.  I haven't played a lot of Age of Steam, but this feels like a tighter and streamlined Age of Steam.  I like the human factors components that I'm seeing being built into the more recent train games which make it easier to remember what to do next.  Yes the board does take some getting used to.

At the start of the game your bids are on the top rows, but as the game moves on, those trains become more and more important.

A very very tight game, where you need to track a lot of variables, and if you misjudge things you can really end up playing sub-optimally.  On the other hand there really are ways to mess with the plans of others.  Woe to those who are unable to sell their track.

Pick up and deliver / opportunistic network building. Your rails must be sold immediately after use in most of the cases in order to avoid costs. It is an ok game, I did not enjoy it as much as other Wallace games, partly due to its opportunistic nature.
I also did not like the bidding categories very much. It could be a better game if you built your advancement in the 4 tracks instead of buying it each round. anyhow.

As a Wallace fan it's hard to say no to his games, because there are always some interesting things in his games. This time the game is too static and tactical instead of strategic. With four players the game lasts only for 4 rounds. So no mistake is allowed. I don't think this game will hit the table a lot of times. But Mr Wallace has not to worry, we have 10 alternatives.

Initial impressions: the board is very garish, too garish. It would have been better to have a stylised OS map of similar. The playing area looks like a childrens game.

There are a lack of player aids which summarise turn order and minimal iconography on the board to help things along. Might I suggest the 2nd edition completely rethinks the design.

And after all that negativity, its a typical Martin Wallace game at its best. Lots to balance too much to do, screwage a plenty and some hard economics. I loved it.

I was let down a little on my first play. I had eagerly anticipated this one based on what I read about it, but it seemed too tight for it's own good which created a frustrating play experience. We played a four player game but based on the cube placement, we had determined that the fourth and final round didn't even need to be played. One player had easy access to the remaining goods and the others didn't have a chance to get them. 

To be fair, I think the problem is in the random way cubes are placed on the board. Pull the wrong color of cubes out enough times and you won't have many good to aim for during the game. It ended up feeling a bit dry to me, but I want to get in a few more plays to determine if it was the cube draw or if it just isn't my cup of tea.

The one word I would use to describe this game is "Intricate".  The strategies are not evident. There is a lot to watch in this game.  The order that you take your actions is crucial to maximizing your chances to win.  There are new mechanics in this game that are meshed seamlessly together to create levels of complex choices.  Player interaction is unavoidable and can be subtle or intense depending on your strategy which is constantly changing because of the amount of player interaction.  The way Mr Wallace has knitted the new mechanics to promote player interaction has ensured that the game experience is short and intense right up to the last turn.  In my first game I was completely out of position to maximize my points in the last turn and this is because it was a learning game.  This is a compact little gamers game and I loved it.  I can't wait to try it again because there are other strategies I want to try.  Re-playability might appear to limited but it isn't.  This game is re-playable because of the player interaction affecting  your strategies so much.  This game is made for the gamer that can plan ahead.  There is a lot going on in this game and I found myself seeing better moves I could have made after I finished my turn.  This is a main motivator for me wanting to try it again.  I am a fan of these type of games and this rating will probably go up with more plays.

An enjoyable game of building rail lines and capturing cubes.  The map (geography) really constrains the game, and it is pretty annoying at times.  It seems like astute players will keep track of how to exploit the various railroads on the board instead of focusing exclusively one particular region or rail network.  There is plenty of room for screwage through cube poaching and route blocking.  Overall, it was okay, but it didn't feel like a great game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Spend resource cubes on bidding for influence on a number of tracks which then determine player order for different aspects of the game. (track building, leasing loco's shipping goods etc, the usual kinda things). In this game, track costs you, unless you can influence a bigger company to buy it off you and the timing of this is key.

Quite a decent, different, train game, not just puckup and deliver. You can't be ahead on all the influence tracks and the bidding mechanism means that you can get stitched up or not be able to quite get what you need in each round. 

Needs another play from me now I know how it works, as I managed to cock up my last turn of the first game, missing out on the set completing aspect of the game that comes in to give bonus points for what you have delivered during the game.

If you like Wallace games you're likely to like this too - at least I think that there's a distinctly 'Wallace' feel to it even without it being very similar to any of his other games in the way it plays - but it does have the few turns/ multiple phases per turn structure, which is now a bit of a trademark, as well as the the need to consider the spatial dimension in terms of map position which adds that extra layer to the complex decisions you're faced with (and reminiscent of brass in that way, if not comparable in other respects).  I liked it a lot but was cautious with my initial rating, while suspecting it  would go up with further plays - it has (albeit those were plays of the remake "First Train ...").

Rather fiddly with three different turn order tracks and four influence tracks but with an interesting mix of set and random influence points for auction each turn. The board art is clear but ugly. The gameplay is quite clever in a euro-ish way. For instance points are scored for sets of different goods and passengers. How does this relate to profitability? Well, obviously it doesn't. It's just an excuse to make the players compete in several areas.

Feels like a Martin Wallace game for sure but I didn't get the brain burning feeling that normally accompanies playing his titles. The auction is interesting yet I didn't care for the random element because it made it hard to plan ahead, which you really have to do. The rest of the game is just jockeying for position to pick up resources (points) and your place on the turn order tracks. It's ok but not my favorite Wallace.

I tend to enjoy the majority of Wallace's work. 

This one is deeper than I realized at first blush. Of the Treefrog games to date, I'd put Last Train in the upper tier. 

I wish the board was a little more attractive, but once the game play starts, I'm not distracted by it.  The various influence tracks and the auction seem clunky to manipulate, although I enjoy their actual impact on the game decisions. I wish there was a more elegant way to represent the same information.

I'm looking forward to more plays of this one.

RATING: 7
Last Train is Martin's second installment of the "investment cube" rails series that he began last year with the lacklustre Steel Driver. Wensleydale takes the familiar cube mechanism, which was the best part of SD and has grafted it onto a completely new game which no longer borrows extensively from the [[Prairie Railroads Series]].

The gameplay of Wensleydale is fairly straight-forward. Players use investment cubes which are handed out at a finite rate of 12 per round to bid on influence chips that will allow them to borrow locomotives, sell old track to larger, successful companies, and also to build track despite the objections of angry white men. Influence chips are purchased in an Amun Re like auction phase where players can win two boxes of influence chips and can over-bid other people (with the person who was over-bid getting their cubes back to place somewhere else). After everyone has received chips, then players can build track on the hideous board, linking up to cheese, adjacent to stone, and to waiting passengers. People want to get to towns that are linked into the two larger rail companies (red, green) and cheese/stone simply wants to be delivered to a town, any town. The people and things are both shipped using rented trains that have varying capacity for people and things, and which have to be re-bought each round. Everything that is shipped goes in front of you, and at the end of the game you receive a VP for each thing, and an additional 2 VPs for each set of 4 (red/green person, cheese, stone) that you've collected. That's basically it.

The play in Wensleydale is pretty interesting on first blush, and is a clear improvement on SD. The investment cubes being handed out at a finite rate, as in that game, fixes one of the perceived problems of rail games with cash: that positive growth spirals are hard to keep in check. Making people work with the same amount of working capital each game is an elegant fix and is still good here. The Amun Re auction is also put to good use here, though I will give the proviso that that is likely because we played with 4, as there are only 8 boxes to bid on and each player wins 2, so competition is spurred more. As with Amun Re, I would expect the game to be weaker with 3 because this central mechanic needs max scale to fully shine, and would go so far as to conjecture that it would be at least two rating points lower for me at that scale.

The board play itself is very tight. This makes it interesting in the short term, but I don't know how well it will hold up. The inability to build duplicate links and the tight central board play in the valleys means that it can be easy to construct track that restricts other people's options a lot, and you have to scrap for one or the other type of people, with red seeming to be much harder to get because the game only starts with 2 red cities buried in the south. I think with very much repeat play there would be a very real danger of scriptedness, though I also will say that making variant boards for this game would be pretty easy and I could see that happening if the game catches on very much.

The game is also very tactical and feels odd in that regard, the most permanent thing you have is influence, and optimal turns seem to consist of laying down some track, shipping everything and then scrapping that track back at the end of the turn. The devil is, of course, in the details, but I think this makes the game more simplistic than I would like, as there are few incentives to keep a real contiguous network together, like Tinner's Trail you just build, gut that part of the board, and then move on. Like TT, there are some short term benefits to having stuff in the same area (here in terms of not having to spend as much company influence to make fresh connections to company towns) but for the most part it's a turn by turn optimization game.

For the time being, I can see playing it a few more times before it dips to something lower. I don't see this as being a regular on the table though, it's a bit too long for what it actually offers to me, though it does have a nice blend of decisions and mechanics, and is definitely worth trying if you're a Martin or train game fan.

Good grief is the board ugly! I mean, not just a little bit. If I were Martin, I would have delayed the game and paid the artist twice to start over (or more likely find a new artist). Not only is it super ugly, but there are a few places where you can't really tell whether regions are adjacent. And some areas are too small for the pieces that need to go in them. Awful.

Oh, yeah, there's a game that goes on the board. And I like it. I liked how instead of just bidding for turn order (yawn), there are buckets or various influence points, enough for 2 per player, and we have a parallel bid for all 8 at the same time. I also like how there's no economic build-up. Everyone gets the same income every round. Which is used for the bid, and to build. 

It feels like the most "Knizia" of any Wallace game I'm played, as there are 4 different things that can be picked up (2 types of passengers, 2 types of goods), and you're trying to collect sets.

After discovering that Martin Wallace's Steel Driver was an enjoyable game, I became interested in his other railway games he put out under the original Treefrog label, i.e., a board and only wooden components. And so, one fine day, I found myself sitting behing the garish board of the original Last Train to Wensleydale.

The game is a fairly straightforward one, in which players attempt to rapidly invest in laying track, then transport passengers and goods along their track (worth VPs) using trains they also purchase for the round, and then sell the track to another generic company before the cost of having own track on the board overwhelms them. LTtW is but played over a few rounds, so you don't have a lot of opportunity to grab the juiciest spots; and if you do you have to be sure that your cash flow can support an extravagant spending regime. The game is fairly forgiving in the sense that it allows you to spend earmarked influence in one of four denominations to lay down track and purchase trains; you are not limited to the 'money' in the form of cubes you bid with to get the earmarked influence in the first place. It just might be more efficient to have earmarked influence because purchasing the important trains to haul away your VPs that way is very costly. Also, because of the tendency of the board to 'reset' itself between turns, the strategic paths players can take appear to be somewhat limited. Turn order manipulation is important, because being first to be able to grab important trains or lay down track towards the juiciest spots on the map is nothing to be sneezed at... but with just four or five turns there simply isn't much opportunity to practice those skills. I walked away from a moderately positive experience feeling there 'ought to have been more' to the entire thing.

LTtW is not, I think, a bad game. But if I compare it to the other Treefrog railway game, Steel Driver, then the latter wins out for me. For one thing, Steel Driver has a clear strategic purpose to everything that you do: build up a profitable and important cube grabbing finale. Many don't like that aspect, but it is there nonetheless and players are expected to keep it in mind just the same. In Last Train to Wensleydale, VPs roll in nearly by themselves; there are no surprises at the end; players block each other more or less directly; there is a little competition in who gets to grab what first. Servicable, but not very exciting. The other thing is that the map of Steel Driver is simply a lot more playable than the bowel movement of this title. So, in the end, I'll play LTtW upon request without much fuss, but I needn't play it all the time, much less own a copy of my own. I have since removed the game and its remake First Train to Neurenberg from my wishlist.

The rate of '6' is a tad generous.

Another success from Treefrog. Very enjoyable train game. The set up has a reputation for taking a long time but we find that if one person does the goods and one person does the passengers while the third sorts out things like putting player discs in the right places and finding the game turn marker, set up takes3 or 4 minutes.  Top Tip - use a shirt pocket as a 'bag' for randomly pulling the passengers.

The way the set up produces a different board each time is one of the games greatest assets.  In our games it seems as though one player gets to go through the middle of the board to Hawes from a green station, one player goes up the left of the board from 'The South' and one player hoovers up the green fields and looks for an opportunity to latch on the other players lines.  Very often a third route is opened up going throught the northernmost valley.

First thing that pops into my mind with this game is the hideous board!  Once you get past that, it's an enjoyable game.  
Mr. Wallace has done a nice job distinguishing this game from other pick up and deliver train games by having new mechanics (not to mention the theme!). Instead of cash, players spend "investment cubes" to purchase track. Influence can be earned it several tracks, to include Government, Train, and two regional companies, the latter of which is used to build from these company towns as well as sell one's track to. Players will want to sell some of their track to the companies each turn, as track maintenance is expensive and tracks not sold to the companies are also negative VPs at game end.

As for the feel of the game, there is a lot of similar concepts, such as planning ahead (it's very strategic), purchasing and laying track, and shipping goods and passengers. Turn order is different for each phase of the game, so the player who builds track first may not be the player who gets to buy a train first or ship first. There can be a lot of screwage if more than one player is competing in the same area of the mapboard. The way that influence points are earned in the 4 different tracks is interesting and requires careful planning as well.

Another good train game from the master of them. I particularly like the mechanism of slowly selling your track to the main lines which extends thier reach. This creates a tight tension between continuing to maintain your own track so no one else can use it versus abandoning it to the hoipoloi.
This is particularly crucial for the player(s) that build through the two main lowland valleys (the centre - typically from green - and the west edge - typically from red). These valleys are key choke points which can allow one player to monopolise whole sections of the board unless another player pays big to go through the high valleys.
Lots of other good stuff in here too: limited actions/bidding via a pool of cubes; train rentals; max/min profit/loss levels which allow extreme strategies.
I do wonder if it has much replayability. While the chalk & cheese setup will create some variation with each play, the game is very much driven by the map and key valleys which wont change.

Based on first play.

Super game - Martin Wallace on great form. One of the best tie-in's between mechanics and theme I have played. And it plays well - and is a proper board game with tactical placement on a board - no multi-player solitaire with your own player boards here.

Track placement, what to ship and how to ship it all present interesting choices and at the same time you have to consider how this turn's spend sets you up for next turn's play and build order. Terrific stuff. The seeding of resource to the board means a different strategic challenge each game.

Downside - a little bit fiddly (not the set-up which is actually good fun, i.e. seeing how the board sets itself) when you are spending shuffling points on the influence tracks and deciding play and build player order. Some people don't like the board - It could have been better I guess but personally I don't dislike it and it is functional.

The only other things was I won despite making a mega-blunder at the end of turn one by selling too much track which effectively gave up exclusive access to one of the main east-west valleys. I spent the rest of the game enjoying the play but assuming I would come in last only to find I had won - I felt a complete fraud and felt the need to add my score up three times and go back over it the next day in case I'd accidently cheated. I did hoover up a lot of lowland cheese due to not having access to the stone (which was being hotly contested) and I had not realised that in the final reckoning stone only counts one point for victory points - so I was doing better than I thought during the game. But still it didn't feel quite right in a game which felt so skill/strategy focussed to win by accident.

Want to play again though. 

Played a couple more times now and it's holding up well - really like this.

Players are trying to run minor rail lines through the Yorkshire Dales, then flog them off to large companies.  Players work through a turn by purchasing lots of influence via auction, then spend that influence on building track, buying trains, running stuff off the board, and then selling track to either the Midlands Railway, or North Eastern Railway.  You're assessed at the end of each turn for stuff you transported and infrastructure left on the board.  Game ends after four (?) turns and you score for your stuff, sets of stuff and you're overall profit/loss tally incurred during the game.  Not a bad game, with obvious bits lifted from other games.  The auction is taken directly from Amun-Re, the transportation from the Age of Steam series, etc.  As usual with Wallace games, there is a large entry cost in terms of rules, which combined with the 2 hour playing time, means this won't be a game I'll be playing a lot of (or buying).  Kudos to the mapboard ... took me back to Yorkshire's orange hills and yellow valleys.. even the nice green lowlands have problems - you can see the hedgerows but not the area borders!  Plays okay, yet feels a tad underdeveloped - like there is a cog or two too many spinning inside this game.

Not your usual train game: 5 types of resources (4 of which are auctioned), all track counts as loss, passenger and cargo trains are only "rented", track may (in reality, must) be sold to bigger companies, large networks of your own track not important.

The highlight of this train game is the way you can sell your track at the end of each turn. You can take parts of your track from the board and sell it to one of two parent companies and it becomes "company track" now. As you get charged each turn for every piece of track you have on the board, it's essential to start lowering your costs (track). The catch is that when you do this, you lose control of areas on the board as anyone can build from the company towns connected to company track. So there's this wonderful choice at the end of your turn -- after you've done all the bidding, building, and cube grabbing -- of what to leave of all that you've just constructed and what to sell in order set up for next turn.

Goods and passengers are moved via trains you rent for the turn and are chosen in one of the three turn orders and make you money and score you points. You're also rewarded at game end for sets of every type of passenger and cube in the game so you're forced to diversify to some extent. As red and green passengers need to be moved to their respective colored towns, you have to remain flexible in how you build your routes.

It's all very good except that the game lacked a way for people to come back once they were down; a problem that is addressed in First Train to Nuremburg. First Train enables you to move passengers via 1st, 2nd, or 3rd class for 3/2/1 points per passenger moved so that you can possibly get some extra points for sending a lot of passengers as well as for participating in the connection of two cities on the board. I'd seen a couple Last Train games where one player was behind and just didn't have the opportunities to possibly climb back in; not fun. On the whole, I prefer First Train as the game Last Train was meant to be.

Purchased through subscription with Wallace.

Whoa!  This is very different from his other train games.  I didn't see how that was going to be possible.  I thought I would see too many similarities.

Track, which costs upkeep can be assigned to major companies to reduce your cost.  Your trains are purchased new each turn (there are only 3-4 rounds) and removed at the end of each round; each train carries different combinations of passengers & goods.  Goods are not delivered point to point, but are assigned to your train; you may pick up & load as many goods as you are able.  Some goods are worth more than others, and not all goods can be transported if connected to a company town.  Passengers ride the rails, but only if on the correct line.  These are some of the differences.

Another interesting train game from Wallace.  This might even be my favorite--it and Steam.

Solid game.  Definitely one of the better Wallace games.  Significantly behind Brass and Age of Steam, but well ahead of Automobile, Liberte, and Perikles for me. 

The board gets very tight at the end.  So tight, you might not do a single thing on the last turn if you can't get turn order.  In the long run, I don't feel like there's going to be enough flexibility in the map.  It's going to reward a lot of study of the map in the beginning because it's relatively easy to block off areas and depending on the board, some areas just suck.  Cutting North and South through the valleys is an absolute bastard.  Not impossible, but a bastard nonetheless.

There's plenty of intentional screwage to be had in the game, but probably more annoying is the coincidental screwage.  The consequences of turn order is often opaque and what seems like a good plan in the auctions, can quickly go south once people start actually building their routes and snagging up trains.  Luckily, this is not a two hour game, so this kind of thing is not entirely unforgivable.

I think one of the genious things that will be key to the game on repeated plays is the bounds on income.  I wouldn't be too worried about going negative in the early game.  One load I delivered for a 13 surplus only to fall back to 4 income in the last round because of the bounds.  I like it.  It allows you to sacrifice a bit for board position early because the early leaders can't just blast past 6.

Intricate historically based train game - more gamerly fun from Martin Wallace. slightly above Tinner's Trail on the complexity axis, but not as involved as Brass.  Am going to enjoy exploring this, though some concern that the board  and game mechanics will lead to overly similar plays - building routes are quite restricted in the hills.  Well produced, straightforward to learn and teach.

Thıs is a very good game in the medium warfrog complexity level (lower than Brass, higher than Tinners, at the same level of Automobile). Fiddly set up rules and some track placement and cubes movement exceptions seemed to drag it at first glance, but the system really works. A very good and demanding game, the player must take care of many, many things during the game. The auction, with its nice Amun Re style, is really clever. The rules for laying track, moving goods and passangers and merge tracks become easier with practise and the game flows quite quickly. The underdog of this year and so far my worst ranked game, it is however one of my favourites Martin Walace´s games.

This is a nicely layered game with some interesting nooks and crannies to explore. Just once play so far, and I need another play to properly assess the game.  I was quite intrigued, but I hesitate because I find that most of these Treefrog games only get one or two plays before I feel like I've sufficiently explored them.

[UPDATE] I did end up buying the re-issue First Train to Nuremburg, because it offered improved content at a much lower price. That version also includes an optional scaled-down market that improves the three-player game (although it's still much better with four).

Really interesting and new mechanics, which works well together. The only problem with the game is that (at least) first game (it took 3:20 for us) will be long and it requries a second game to understand what you did wrong in the first. But everyone was eager to giveit a second try as soon as possible. In any case it's much better and interesting than Martin's last game Automobile.

I haven’t played many of the Wallace titles, but I am beginning to see what people are talking about when they mention his style of games. To my view, this feels like a typical Wallace game yet I cannot pinpoint why. I think these types of games takes a lot of work to get into and for it to be worth the effort I would want more than a testing game. While the rules aren’t that complex, there are a lot of interwoven mechanisms which will make it hard to "get" the strategy.

This game is a pick up and delivery game, which feels quite tactical. Tactical because while there certainly are long term strategy you have to maximize your turn (especially last turn) and take opportunities that arise and avoid taking heavy loss. Timing is important and you want to take advantage of being first.

RATING: 8
There is a little bit of fiddliness to the game—there are three separate turn order tracks, if you can believe that—but I thought it was really good. Lots to think about and lots of capacity for planning ahead. I don't know how much replayability it has, though, since there might not be enough variation in the random setup. The only thing that turned me off was the fact that there's no hidden information, so the final turn can bog down into endless calculation. Other people might enjoy that sort of thing, though. 

I would have gotten myself a copy at bgg.con had it not been so damn expensive. Sheesh!

Most strangely colored board since the old Bar Lev game from way back. What were they thinking? And, there are several very small sides connecting areas that certainly could have been made more visible.

Mechanics work nicely, although goods seem to run out towards the final turns, and it seems like it might be more profitable for people to do nothing on the final turn sometimes. Lasted around two hours and maintained interest throughout. Going slow and steady does not seem to work, players need expand far and quick. White influence more important than some players seemed to realise. Needs more plays for a rating though. Adjusting influences is a little bit fiddly.

Wallace puts his usual screws against the players in terms of tight resources and limited profit-making ability. Like many of his best, mistakes are harshly punished.

At first glance, I was starting to get annoyed that this would be another Age of Steam variant, with all the influence point tracks, Profit/Loss tracks, and all the other number-cruncher madness that is AOS. While playing it, I couldn't help but wish I was playing Brass instead.

After playing twice, it turns out to be a looser game than AOS, but not as loose as Brass or RRT. There are some interesting turn-order mechanics that seem to be cropping up in several Martin Wallace games (AOS, Rise of Empires, Tinner's Trail), along with other similarities. The game seems deceptively short with only four turns (in a 4P game), and there are only four track build actions in the entire game. However, there is plenty to consider in terms of build order, move order, four different influence tracks, train size, transferring ownership to the larger train companies, and track laying in rather harsh terrain. Still, at 2-3 hours, this seems rather long, but I suspect it could be shrunk to 2 hrs with experience.

Tinner's Trail, which is Wallace's other design, seems to have a similar feel (even though it is a mining game), with only four turns, and focus on extracting as many resources off the board as possible. Both are solid games, but I cannot help but compare them to Brass, and would much prefer to spend my time playing Brass than slogging through these two designs.

OK, I confess, I love this game. I love its quirkiness and the fact that it's themed around English eccentricity (where else in the world would you build a railway in a fundamentally loss-making situation) and corruption. The aim is to build track, then once all value is extracted, offload the rails to an established big railway company. There's perhaps not enough competition for goods and passengers, but there's incentive to hang on to your track, as advancing the big company railheads allows others to connect to them more easily. My only complaint is that the standard map is far too easy. You just build in the lowlands and get access to the bulk of the resources with little incentive to build along the valleys. In spite of this, Martin Wallace always shines in his train games and it's evident again here as this is his best Treefrog release for a while. Please sack the artist who drew that ghastly board.

A bit of a disappointment, I think this could have used a few more shots at development.  The board is simply awful.  Not only is it unattractive, several asthetic decisions make it unworkable.  The lines you need to see are obfuscated by a bizzare hill pattern, that looks more like a green lung than rolling hills.  It is also garrish in the extreme.  

There are lots of fiddly elements -- setup for one, but also three different turn order tracks that required constant reference.  More importance and strategic emphasis would have been achieved by a single track that could more readily been the focus of player's attention.  

End game is a downer, as options diminish rather than expand over the game.  It gives the game a VERY anticlimactic feel on the last turn.  In my 3 player game, for 2 of the 3 players the most economical course of action was to do nothing.  

Finally, there may be game winning geography.  There is a central corridor that will typically be rich in resources, converts track easily (due to the multiplicty of towns) and is only really accessible to one player.  More games are required to see this for sure, but in both games I played (1 with 3 players, the other with 4) the player who accessed this central corridor won handily.

Initial view after first play was not that positive, but can see some scope for improvement.  In the first game it seemed to a large extent that the player's turns were quite disjoint and there wasn't a feeling of forming a strategy but just making the best of each of your turns with short term tactics.  I could see the possibility that this might not prove true with more plays so will give it another chance.
Enjoyed 2nd play more.

16.10.2009: I have now read the rules to this, and it sure looks like a great game! Looks more complicated than it is. I will hopefully get to try it soon. This one will surely get a rating of 8 or higher.

28.10.2009: Ok, so I rated it 9 straight away. It's good, probably the best Treefrog game so far (I've enjoyed the ones I've played so far). I really like the auction, and the take over part. I really messed up in my first game with those take overs. You really shouldn't keep track too long, it will hurt you. The influence tracks are a bit fiddly since the internal order of the discs is important, but if you have one player do the disc moving after the auction it isn't that bad. Haven't experienced the setup, so I can't comment on that. Really looking forward to the next session of this game.

RATING: 8
Like Tinners' Trail, Wallace has picked a very specific region and has translated the unique characteristics of that region's industries and growth period into an innovative collection of game mechanics that work. I don't think any designer in history does this as successfully or as interestingly as Wallace, and it is this more than anything that makes him entirely unique in the world of game design. In Wensleydale, Wallace focuses on the very small, independent railway companies that cropped up to deliver iron and cheese around the very difficult, hilly terrain in Yorkshire. The two major railway lines (Midland Railways and North-Eastern Railways) did not want to invest heavily in developing the area and so depended on small railway entrepreneurs to build out the track and then buy it up from them. Players take on the roles of these hapless, profitless, and doomed entrepreneurs.

This game is strategically a bit heavier than Tinners' Trail, but I like them both about equally and they highlight exactly why I always look forward to a new Wallace game. He is a designer like no other.

UPDATE: While I collect Treefrog games and so will hold onto this one, the reboot "Last Train to Nuremburg" has a two-sided board and better art design. That is the copy to get if you are not a collector.

Wensleydale is typical Wallace. 

There is a rather long setup phase during which the board is randomly seeded with all available goods in four types: cheese, stone, and two varieties of passenger. From there it's a route-building game. Lay track, lease trains according to your delivery needs, ship. 

So what are the twists? Well, mainly there are five currencies in the game. You have investment capital (cubes) which you use to bid on lots of influence in four areas. You need influence in the two major train companies (both non-player) to lay track in and out of their cities. You need "engine" influence to lease trains for deliveries. And you need government influence to clear stubborn farmers from your path. 

The other big twist is that your track becomes a liability as the game goes on, so you're under pressure to sell it off to the two major (non-player) train companies. Doing so improves your profit margin / score, but at the cost of opening up all kinds of board access for your opponents. 

Note that Wensleydale is not an economic snowball game or a "most money" game. There is a profit-loss track, but it only serves as a score swing at the end and is capped at both ends. No player elimination. Not much money management (some with your cubes). You score points for each delivery. You lose them at the end of the game for track you have not folded into the companies. You gain extra points for delivering complete sets of the four goods types. That's about it. 

So like I said, typical Wallace. This style of game isn't inherently compelling for me, but at least there are some novel ideas here. I was disappointed that the cheese theme is actually completely incidental (no production or anything like that). Oh well. 

Update: I've had a chance to think for a couple of months, and there's just no way I'm that interesting in replaying this. A hideous and clunky game with only mild redeeming qualities here and there.

(Comment after one game each with 3p and 4p):

The best Treefrog-line game to date, by far. I think I liked the 4p more than the 3p one, but the latter worked just fine too (the main problem being that the double Amun Re auction at the beginning of each round was pretty flat when just 6 out of 8 sets are sold).

The game itself is a lovely multidimensional optimization problem. You really, really want to go early in the turn order so white influence is needed, but track is useless without replacements for your constantly rusting trains, so brown influence is probably the most important of all. In the meanwhile ignoring red and green will feel great in the beginning, but very soon you'll find yourself unable to sell off your tracks to the major companies quickly enough, and take a massive hit at the end of the game.

The network building aspect is quite well executed too, with the main interest coming from the manipulating the building restrictions (blocking, arranging for good selling opportunities, and for good future expansion after selling off part of the track) while still building something immediately useful.

There are some negatives too.

Rules writing of the usual Warfrog quality, managing to make what is a rather simple game confusing. Luckily we had multiple people who had read the rules before the first game, for a crosscheck of the explanation.

The board's "intestines and cheese" look is ugly enough that random passers by stopped to comment on it while we were playing. WTF were they thinking?

Maintaining the influence tracks is fiddly, and not for a huge amount of benefit (basically just to be able to do the tiebreaker for various kinds of turn order). However, we found that doing it by color (first do all white in order, then all brown in order, etc) rather than by box (do box 1 fully, etc) was at least a bit easier. Likewise the initial setup is a lot of fiddly work.

I don't have any problems with the graphic design of the game.  I find the cover art to be very attractive.  The board is unique, with some strange color choices, but it's not that bad (similar to Metropolys, which everyone seems to loathe).

I also like the theme.  While I don't know anything about the area, I like the idea of shipping cheese (even though it's totally abstract).  Reading the rules, I'm convinced that Martin Wallace pays a great deal of attention to historical/local flavor, and I definitely feel that while playing his games.

Unfortunately this means that the rules are often very clunky and unintuitive.  There is a lot going on in this game.  The setup is surely way too fiddly, but I can live with it.  I also like the auction and the way the different tracks work.  But the board play is what annoys me.  It feels very restrictive and awkward.  I hope to play again to see if any of my concerns can be resolved, but I think it may be difficult to get this game back to the table.

Take Tinner's Trail. Instead of 20 territories you're fighting over, there are around 60. Add four victory tracks and a really odd profit mechanism. Make the map a little too random and you're off.

The annoying things about this game are also what make it good.

-It can really throw off the game if you get a lot of adjacent territories with no goods in the initial draw. (Read: it gives you interesting obstacles to deal with.)

-I managed to get my first to influence spots at 2 cubes each, and spent the entire rest of the game maxed out with money. I mean, huh? (It doesn't do shit if you're doing really well in any one of the like eight currencies here.)

-The four influence tracks... well, I was never lacking for tokens on any of them. (Everyone else was, but again, even getting lucky in one area of the game ain't shit if your trackbuilding sucks.)

-The profit meter only goes up to five? I felt like maybe ten would be better. (Keeps things at least looking close for well into the game.)

It feels kind of random. I placed third of four; places one and two were WAY out ahead.

It is nice and short. We went through the rules in 20 min. and played it in an hour and three quarters, and when there're this many wheels within wheels, that's quite an accomplishment on Wallace's part. Jury's out. It's both ingenious and wonkier than Willy Wonka.

I wonder what random part of England Wallace'll cover next? Are we going to have a game about Stornoway fishermen? Shepherds on Jersey?

Now played three times.  This is a good game.  The Wensleydale gap may not be the game breaking strategy I initially feared.  In my first two games I won, and I chalk that up partially to being able to develop a portion of the board away from the other players - at least for the first couple turns.  The third game was a rather meager affair with lots of invalid goods removed from the board, it was also a 3 player game, meaning we had an "extra" turn to use.  Not sure I liked this third outing as much as I had hoped.

I dislike the very fiddly discs on the influence tracks.  For some reason the whole purple moves 1 step on brown, 2 steps on red and 1 step on green sort of tracking seems harder to process than it ought to be.  Shades of Liberte (ugh).

I'm going to resist buying this one, but will agree to play it if someone else brings it, and requests it.

An interesting take in the train games genre. Abstracted quite a lot, but works fine and the mechanics are pretty clever. The board is unfortunately very hideous and also unclear in some points.

Medium complexity train game with an unusal twist: how to get rid of your track as soon as possible? Balancing act with influence points and collected goods/passengers **** Definitely much better than Automobile and even better than Steeldriver. Looks to be the best in the Treefrog Line, but not nearly as good as Brass or Age of Steam.

Nicely done - and fresh - train game. Some unique ideas included, which why this is interesting and fun game. It's very hard to make some profit here, but who cares? One of the best games on 2009 I've played. After couple of games I'm convinced, that this game is good. The biggest issue here is, that it's quite long compared to what you get. I'm thinking about the buy the new edition...

Initial impressions are positive for me after my first play.  Of course, it helped I'm sure that I won...;-)  Interesting blend of seeking to collect sets of stone, cheese, green and red passengers as each set of four is worth 2 bonus points.  As well, there is the need to sell much of your track back to either the red or green RRs to reduce losses - but only after you've sucked most of the resources dry along the route.  Each track costs you one income at the end of the round and loses you one point for each track at the end of the game as well.  The Amun-Re style auction early in the game in which you pursue different types of influence (government, engine, and both major RRs) is one that becomes quite contested, particularly late in the game.  

The game is very fiddly to set up and to move the different influence tracks is a bit of a pain as well.  I really had no problem with the allegedly "garish" board, but some of the small regions were too tiny.

I like this more than some of the other Wallace games, as it makes at least a token effort to not be dry and flavorless. But even so, it still kind of bogs down and ultimately just isn't any fun to play.

RATING: 7
based on 1 play with 4 players.

interesting train game of building track, delivering goods (4 different types), and getting rid of built track.  4 different influence tracks are used to pay for various actions of the game.  An auction is used to gain points on the influence tracks.  Three different turn orders for various actions that are filled by position on influence tracks.  Nice that all influence tracks are useful at some point in the game for players.

game is somewhat marred by a board that can be difficult to read at times.  Some areas are hard to find the boundaries of, and adjacency is difficult also - and both of these are critical to reading the board and making good decisions.

overall I would like to play it again.

RATING: 9.5
Another brilliant game by Martin Wallace. It's trains again, but very different from his other traingames. Some new mechanisms as well as some older mechanisms known from other Wallace games come back in the various phases of the game, however glued together into a very novel way. Good planning is needed, I like the auction for influence points very much. You have to manage 5 different currencies (cubes+4 types of influence). Thematically very strong again.

copy #1234 autographied by Wallace himself!

So much to think about.  So many ways to get screwed.  So many choices, so little time.  A wallace like I like them.  Tight.  VERY tight.  I think this one might be at it"s best with a full complement of 4 players but it's still a blast with 3.  Great game which, as usual, took too long to get to the table for the quality of it.

RATING: 7
After one play, I am keen to get this on the table again as soon as possible. This is, to date, the best Wallace game I've played - in fact, one of the best games I've played, period. It's straightforward, but deep, with plenty of potential to make your own mistakes or force others into making them. This is a solid 9, would be a 10 if it wasn't for the headache-inducing board making me want to vomit. Martin, please get someone else to design your boards!!!

An economic game without any money. Who'da thunk it? Classy.

EDIT: I think the south-west is a bit too strong because there's only one effective path through the valleys, so other players have to find other (more expensive) routes.

Ordered from Green Knight Games in UK.  Coming "Surface Mail."  May take 2 - 12 weeks to arrive, but that's OK.   Well, it arrived after 8 days!  Wow! All hail UK Surface Mail (and the US Postal Service too)!

Rating after 1 play.  I really liked this.  Lots of things fans of Wallace have come to like:  bidding, jockeying for routes, and tight competition goods/passengers to ship.  I like the take-over concept.  Each player is running a fledgling, cash-strapped rail company.  You need to convince the larger RRs to take over your unprofitable track.

I think this is a 4P-only game for me.  The 3P game is too wide open, not enough player interaction with 3.

Initial rating after 1 play: Pretty tough game! Definitely not as "easy" as Tinner's Trail or Steel Driver.

Despite the quite fiddly set-up I enjoyed our first play a lot. Lot's of semi-familiar Wallace mechanics, but the game feels fresh. As always with Wallace it's very interactive. 

I especially like the 3 different player orders. Keeps you on your toes.

Disappointed in this, coming off of First Train, but that might be normal when going back in time through Wallace reimplementations. Last Train is tighter, blockier, way uglier, and lower scoring. Our first play was a bit marred by early congestion, but I assume that was just bad play. Still, thus far I prefer the slightly greater openness of First Train along with its additional decision factor in variable point scoring for passengers. And it's way better looking (thank you, Dennis).

RATING: 8
Another train game from MW which manages to do something original! Yes - you build track, move goods and earn income, but this is the Yorkshire Dales, and train companies made little or no profit because of the demanding terrain. The basic strategy of the game is to make a quick profit from a stretch of line and then use your influence to get one of the big Railway Companies (Midland and North Eastern) to take it over. In usual Wallacian fashion its all about balancing conflicting needs and working out an optimal strategy. The game takes 1.5 to 2 hours and is slightly more complex than Tinners Trail. This is one of MW's best - a real gem!

RATING: 8
Very good. Rating may rise. A tough, challenging train game, pleasantly different from the share crowd (Wabash &co) or the delivery games (Age of Steam etc). Pretty good ideas here, I like the influence system, the goods movement and the takeover bits.

The cover is one of the best ever and the god-awful bacon omelette board isn't as bad as it may seem.

Suggest.

RATING: 9
First Train to Nuremburg copy.  Loved the game. Can't wait to play again.  I'm a big fan of Brass and Steam and I like this one almost as much.  

My only real complaint is that, yes, it is extremely fiddly.  I feel like we spent an extra 1/2 hour just trying to move pieces around, especially trying to maneuver pieces on the influence tracks.  I don't know about the original but the First Train edition is pretty awful.  The little round discs are slightly bigger than the tracks which they sit on and having to pick up pieces that are under other pieces, we were constantly bumping them and dropping them.  It was a huge annoyance and I can't believe they haven't come up with a better way to do this.

I also think (believe it or not) that I prefer the map from the original edition.  The colors are clearer and it is easier to see where the symbols for cities and for cheese and stone are. The new edition feels cluttered with artwork, though I do like the colors of the map.  The one real advantage is the double-sides board.  I look forward to trying the Nuremburg map.  And it's nice that it plays 2.

As for the game itself, well, I enjoyed it a lot.  I like Wallace games with economic as well as visual and spacial elements.

An interesting auction/pick-up-and-deliver/set collection game with and unusual theme and even more unusual map artwork.  During my play at BGG Con '09, a few people commented on how ugly they thought it was.  No doubt that its bright, but it reminds me of something Van Gough would have done after he went insane.  I kinda liked it.  Anyway, the game was fun and so was the company.

Finally a Wallace game good enough to stand beside Brass. After the overhyped and overrated Automobile, Wallace come out with a really good game this time. Sure that it have it's failures, like an horrible board and a lot of house keeping, but the game is extremely strategic without the grocery accounting that turn off automobile for me. A lot of gaming and pure strategic tactics, remembering a bit AoS and Steel Driver, Wallace have here a pure runner.

RATING: 6
Played once with 4, 2 of which seemed more interested in eating Doritos and jumping to touch the ceiling. Therefore, I wasn't able to get as much out of my first try as I had hoped. I see a lot of potential here, but I also see a lot of fiddliness in set-up and advancing each influence track after bids are done. The poor board design doesn't help either. I'm holding off on a rating until I can get better quality time in.

UPDATE: Still liking the ideas, not liking the 3 player game. Auctions were way too loose. Competition for trains was virtually non-existent. Competition for goods was minimal until the last 2 turns. Not much different after another play with 4, though that could be from having 2 newbies and 1 other who played just once before. All in all, I like what Wallace was trying to shoot for, but I've decided it's just not worth all the fiddle of setup and lousy board design.

Martin Wallace is now 0 for 2 with me with the Treefrog line. This game has a lot of the same problems I have with Tinner's Trail in that the random setup can break the game from the outset and one path (in TT it's one area) can be so powerful as to make the game a race for initial turn order that decides the winner.

I also think it's an atrocious looking game that not only hurts the eyes but is designed to make play harder than necessary. It's also a color-blind hostile design.

I get the game. I think there are some very clever ideas here. The thing that a lot of people are complaining about - the four initiative tracks, for instance - are the parts of the game I like. The randon set-up and the almost necessity of having to collect sets makes this a game I have no need or desire to play again.

It's your customary "build track and run cubes" game but with a lemon twist, Serge. For the small profit you make each turn running cubes, you can't maintain all your track, so you need to "buy" influence points to turn the track you no longer plan to use into common-use track. This leaves less money for building future track. In the meantime all the easy cubes are gone and you need to build further into the hinterland at more cost to get your next income. Lots to manage and think about. On the downside, the auction process was drawn out because of the opaqueness of how turn order would be decided, and turn order can be crucial. If a player takes your expected route, more downtime will ensue as you take stock of the board and your other options. VP's reward collecting a balance of everything, meaning latter turns become more restrictive as you will score best by doing this and this only, making it easier for your collection plans to come undone through accidental collateral damage from other players. A game I'd like to explore further, but the re-assessment downtime in both the auctions and the build is a turn-off.

Good stuff! This has been kind of flying under the radar but it's the best Wallace game I've played in a while and the best in the Treefrog line so far.

The horrible map and the less than exciting theme are probably responsible for this unexpected low profile (we're talking about a Martin Wallace game, after all). 

And that's a shame because this is a very good game! In my opinion this is much better than Automobile, the last Treefrog game I owned. 

Build rails, transport goods and passengers and then get rid of the unprofitable sections of track by selling them to the big companies to reduce operating costs. Build wisely to take advantage of the richest areas in the map and be extra careful when selling track because you can be creating opportunities for the other players.

It's a really cool and well thought out game with a lot of stuff happening and a fresh take on the train game genre. Really worth a try!

I just couldn't get my head around how this game worked. Hard to see what you can/should be doing. Perhaps better with 4 people? We played with 3. And it was our first game. But I really really did not like how it was simply not possible for me to get a single red passenger scored in the whole game. Incredible. Seems like there are a lot of possibilities in the game but still you are too constricted by the map, so you rally cannot do too many different things. Also I didn't like how you sometimes shipped a lot of stuff without getting any economical benefit whatsoever from this.

I am hesitating to rate this game because, after 1 play, I am not sure what I think of it. Long-term strategy seems irrelevant since the dominant strategy is to dismantle as much of your track as possible before the end of the game and you can only dismantle one length per turn. Leaving track on the board is therefore very risky. All in all, a little too tactical for my taste.

Another fine Wallace design. Perhaps a few too many balls to keep in the air; in my one play I was unable to keep all the interacting factors in mind at once, and made mistakes on every turn. Practice and familiarity would help, of course, but I'm not sure the reward would justify the effort. Reminded me of Brass, which I think is a better game and which I would prefer to play (although Wensleydale is certainly easier to teach and learn than Brass).

Three player game felt like it was 1 turn too many as two of us decided the best thing to do in the last round was nothing as doing anything cost us points.  (This included the eventual game winner.)   While the build and deliver aspect is interesting, the game has a lack of elegance about it.  The constant adjustment of the various influence tracks - digging discs out from under others or moving bits up and down.  And the one phase that is small actions (build trains, move passengers, goods) really need not be past the few conflicts that might be on the map.  (Sort of like the demand in Automobile...once you are past the initial few decisions, everyone just grabs their stuff.)  Might be a bit more interesting with 4 as the influence auctions is more meaningful with players forced into last choices, but 3P left me feeling flat.

--Oct2009-- One play with my three youngsters.
The game is really quite delightful!  There's lots of tactical thrashing about at first blush, and it's possible that some more strategic concepts might open up once one is clearer on the dynamics.  On the downside, the setup is fairly tedious, and the influence marker movement extremely fiddly.  Even so, for the moment at least, I'm very eager to play again.
--Nov2009-- After a first play with older opponents, I'm still intrigued.  I have this strange delusion that the game is trying to provoke a less-than-greedy tactical optimization out of the players.  Even if that's true, it's not clear that it works completely; nonetheless, I still find the system intriguing.

I like the Yorkshire Dales, Wallace games, wooden bits, so am happy with this, but could do with actually playing it some time. Next week, maybe.
(Edit Feb 2011):Finally played, 4 player. Very enjoyable, interesting decisions, seems like the random set up should add enough variety to keep this replayable. Maybe the auctions aren't important enough, there often didn't seem to be any particularly bad or overwhelmingly great choices, so little bidding up in our game - can see this changing with experience. 
Love the implementation of theme in this, although I am particularly disappointede that Penrith is just labelled "The North", couldn't it at least be "Penrith & The North" - damn you, Mr Wallace.The gripes about the board? Pfft. The colour choices don't particularly disturb me, and while I can see how it all could have been made a bit better with firmer, slightly thicker lines between spaces, a little more space in a few spots in the Dales, there's a lot of information and (in the case of the locomotives) actual prettiness clearly and functionally presented. A turn summary on the board would have been very helpful, and the game has a degree of fiddliness that begins with set up and continues through applying the auction results (surprisingly difficult to manage this simple task whilst fielding rules questions or answering whether sugar is taken with your tea), to making the calculations about how much track to build/sell - but the game for me was definitely worth this. It isn't as intense as Brass, nor as breezy as London - close in other words to Tinners Trail, but somewhat inferior to that in terms of elegance. The counter-intuitive way that profit works is extremely entertaining, and surprisingly difficult to get a grasp of at first, resulting in a pleasingly bitter 'aha' moment when all your carefully orchestrated plans leave you with precious few VPs after the final round.
2014 Edit: My wife absolutely refuses to play this owing to the garishness of the board, which is very disappointing for me. At least the box is pretty, so it serves some purpose sitting on my shelf.Sigh.

Too much of a brain-burner, so few turns that each turn is very big. You spend too much time watching people think, which is boring. Interesting concept since each type of good has a different rule for pickup and delivery. Also, there is only one map, which may become boring.

1 play at Rays.  I like the fact that shipping diversity is rewarded.  I like the market of expenses vs. what was shipping in the current round.  I think having red and green tracks on the board takes some getting used to -- I constantly thought there were green and red players.  Easiest Wallace game to learn so far for me.

RATING: 8
First, I have to say that the theme to this game is amazing.  We are all badgers digging our warren through the lymphatic system of the corpse of a dead rotting giant.  I'm a little concerned that the game is imbalanced toward the plaque scraping strategy, vs cleaning up skin tags and polyps, infected or otherwise.  What's confusing is that some of the little cysts are white and white cysts are bad, vs the white cubes of plaque which are good.  

The game can be a bit of a brain burner as you are auctioning cakes with your young (and you can only produce 12 in a litter per turn) that put you into numerous positions of power and can be used for resources to bribe officials to clean up your spoor.  Lots of parallel processing.  Don't play this with APers.

This plays unlike any game I've played. Undoubtedly, this is the most fun a game can get with this theme.

Maybe there is a good game buried under the complete lack of development. Who knows? The terrible graphic design and rules don't help either.

Just because the game requires thought and is from a great designer, doesn't make it a good game.

Excellent. Very tight and highly tactical. Surprisingly deep but not overly complicated nor your typical train game. Optimization for building routes and preventing yourself from straying too far into debt. Strikes a nice balance between resource management and efficiency in pick up / delivery. Would love to give another go after a first pass at the rules.

It's a pretty thematic, somewhat intricate set-collection, pick-up-and-deliver, network-building game ... a train game! You have to deal with multiple currencies (influence in 4 areas), turn order manipulation, and careful timing to accomplish your goals. After one partial play, I [i]really[/i] want to get this back to the table!

The basic idea is that players are small-time railway operators. They build track (using government influence to override any local opposition, if necessary), make some deliveries and earn some quick cash; but their track isn't actually profitable. In fact, it's a source of loss! So they have to use their influence in the major companies (red/green) to get them to take the tracks off their hands! The companies are trying to expand their networks; they start on the edges of the board and will take track over if it connects to a new town (and you use the appropriate influence, of course).

In the end, the player who moved the most stuff (with bonus for sets) and is most profitable, with fewest tracks on the board, wins!

--- Summary ---
The setup is somewhat tedious, but not so bad if multiple people are doing it: a random distribution of cheese cubes go in the lowlands, stone cubes in the hills, and red/green passengers and/or white opposition farmers in the towns/cities. 

There are 4 Turns. Each turn follows the same sequence: first, players each gain 12 investment cubes (max 15). Then there is an auction for 8 lots, max 2 lots/player. Each lot is for 3-4 influence (some combo of government/engine/green company/red company influence). Players then build one chain of tracks either starting from a company town (any town connected to company tracks) or from a previous link, using investment cubes (and, if necessary, influence) to pay for the builds. The tracks connect regions together. If your build includes company town(s), you of course have to use some company influence to get them to allow the build. Then, players, borrow abstracted company trains (using engine influence) and move pieces (cheese and passengers in connected regions; stone from adjacent hills). Finally, players may spend company influence to get the company to take over a chain of tracks.

There is a bit more to it -- various turn orders for different types of actions, for example -- but that's basically it. After 4 turns, get VP for all the pieces you delivered, with bonus for sets of pieces; plus your current profit level; minus tracks still on the map. Most VP wins!

RATING: 5
When I first saw the board all set up, I thought it was one of the nicest looking, colorful boards I remember seeing.  I read some of the comments here about how ugly the board is.  Wow!  I guess I need to go to art appreciation school :)  Anyway, the game is indeed fiddly, but I usually don't mind that and didn't mind it here.  What I did mind is it just isn't that engaging.  The board, despite its beauty, is somewhat difficult to read clearly, and the decisions regarding where to build didn't strike me as that interesting.  Probably the most interesting aspect is the auction process.  However, it's not enough to save a game that takes too long, is prone to AP, and just doesn't feature enough appealing choices for my taste.  I'll take a different train.
p.s.  Is there a rule that every Martin Wallace train game has to automatically rate close to an 8?

This is a preliminary rate on the game. I really loved the difficult choices players have to make and liked a lot the dispute on the board. Everything is too tight and it gives a lot to think about. I like that in this game because it's not too much cruel. 

Controlling losses is the key towards the end and that's something we should learn with experience.
Again this is just a preliminary rate. It could go up or down depending on how the game works in future plays.

Fiddly annoying setup!

This game has a very strange board. It's maybe one of the most awkward boards I've ever seen. It looks like someone's insides. Components are of very good quality as in other Treefrog line games. This one is very original, it plays very differently from other train games and it really makes sense. A solid design with new mechanics (take a look on that takeover mechanics) and a really deep strategic feeling. I must confess that I suck at it. I really can't figure out what's the best strategy to take and usually get lost at some point of the game. And that's really a challenge to me which at this point of my gaming life it's the best I can say about a game: challenging, strategic, original and fresh.

I wouldn't recommend it to newbies not only because of the unappealing artwork (Peter Dennis didn't make this one as he usually does to Treefrog) but also because of the difficulty of seeing what's happening on the board, the tight auction and investment cubes and the heavy thinking.

Clever and intimate. MW is creating wonderlfully themed games that sets a problem to solve for the players. Not like any train game i have played before, and i wonder if it vould herald a run of games using the same system.

Not sure how replayable it is because of the geography of theboard. Also wonder if it best with 3 as the 4th player can get badly screwed on opening build. I guess the build order in the first turn is vital - the winners of turn order need to be made to pay handsomely for the privilidge of an early build.

The board is rahter lurid - though being colur blind i quite like it.

Not a huge Martin Wallace fan, and I much prefer Age of Steam to this. However, the really random placement of pieces and tightness that comes from a 4 player game is fun... I just wish there was something MORE to the game. It just feels a little flat and boring to me... I guess the idea of delivering cheese isn't the best theme for me? Although I do LOVE cheese...

An interesting and challenging offering from Martin Wallace, but Last Train to Wensleydale lacks the elegance of of some of this designer's other games (recent titles such as Steel Driver and London come to mind). So, it's not a sleek, graceful game (and the horrible map colors and contours certainly add to this impression), but its one where there's plenty to think about and never quite enough actions or resources to do all you'd like, making decisions deliciously difficult. Not Wallace's best, but a game that's likely to stay in my collection for a while, at least.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The first game took a while to understand the strategy and the flow of the game. Very neat interacting mechanisms in terms of turn order, build link order and buy train/deliver goods. Plenty of difficult decisions with jockeying for board position and turn order. Very functional components, but definitely on the fiddly side with the set up taking a long time and lots of movement on the influence track. Can't wait to explore this more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Plenty has been said about the Last Train to Wensleydale color scheme.  The real issue is the tiny space where 7 of each player's tokens are constantly slid, swapped, stacked, restacked, and knocked over.  The constant fiddling seems to mar an engaging train game which would otherwise be one of Wallace's more accessible designs.

Interesting.  Wallace has again succeeded (as in Automobile) in effectively capturing the feel of the historical situation being represented.  The theme is cool and the mechanics tie in to it quite well.  I don't yet have a good handle on effective strategy, but I want to play it more.  I don't consider this a great game (although it is very solid), but it is so interesting, with so many interrelating pieces, that I want to explore it more.

I have played Wensleydale three times and really enjoyed it (twice with 3 players, once with 4 players), but the other players were not as enamored. I liked the fact that it felt very different from other train-themed games (not going to call them train games since there seems to be so much debate over what qualifies as a "train game"), such as Age of Steam, Steam, Steel Driver, and Chicago Express. I liked the fact that you didn't need to really think about long deliveries in Wensleydale and plan out long routes, unlike AoS (and I'm a big fan of Age of Steam), but it was a nice relief in this game to not have to wrack your brain searching for long deliveries. It's more about short-term gain and managing many different currencies. I liked the four different influence tracks and the way the auction worked to gain influence. I liked the way you always needed more of each type of influence and never seemed to have enough of any of them, and I liked the way most of the currencies could be spent for a variety of things (e.g., red influence for connecting to red cities and also for selling your track to the red company, or investment cubes for bidding in the auction and for building track), which made it hard to figure out how to spend your currency, or the white government influence for going early in turn order and also for kicking farmers out of your way so you can build track in their land. All in all it felt fairly different to me and remarkably straightforward for a Wallace game. The board was rather ugly and the setup rather fiddly and the last turn rather anticlimactic, so it's not without its flaws, but I do look forward to trying it again.

Setup takes about 10 minutes, and is what makes each game a bit different. Plenty of competition for prime routes and deliveries even in the 3 player game. Each player must balance 4 different influence levels to efficiently carry out a strategy. Fans of Steam will not be disappointed.

Played once.  Like the mechanics and game play, but it seems the map has a problem with the RED city in the bottom left of the map.  The player building out of there on the 1st turn can lock up a quarter of the map for himself.  Maybe we played something wrong, but it seems to be a big problem.

RATING: 5
After my first game, I would have rated this a 7, but after four games, I doubt I want to play it again. The random setup does not seem to provide as much replayability as one might hope. The board channels play very strongly, which affects the replayability and is also a problem it itself - the central lowlands corridor appears to be much too good (the player building there has won every game I played).

This rating is for the 3-player game. With 4 it's lower.

The more I think about this game, the more I like it.  It has some elements of what I like about Age of Steam (action selection, placing routes, delivering goods), and while I don't like it as much as Age of Steam (duh), it does have a certain familiarity, while also being different and challenging.  I'm still on the fence about it, but it's stayed in my mind long enough that I would like to play it again.  Unfortunately, the price tag is pretty high.  It's terribly fiddly, including having three different turn tracks, but this is a Wallace game, after all.

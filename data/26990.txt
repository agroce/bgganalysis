Rating based on 1 play with "Beginner" added rule.
Incredible game.  Really interesting.  Almost a 9 for me, and more plays may make it that.
Very much a game where the 'market' - i.e. the other players - determines the value of things.  Strangely like Modern Art.

RATING: 8
A special game for special people; this is not a game that will appeal to many as it breaks many standard euro-game tropes but still dresses in euro-game clothing; working with others is good, investing in infrastructure is a mixed bag (and doing so early, contrary to many euros, is less advisable). It can be a fragile game at times (especially at lower player counts), and I think that last point is what makes it have a hit and miss with groups, and ultimately cause the game to fall flat at times. At higher counts, it's less fragile, but overstays it's welcome if it lasts more than about 100 minutes. At that point the iterations needed to push stuff through the system is almost too time consuming for the questions the game asks. I can see where the full game of 20 cubes at 5p allows for you to really flesh out who is after what cubes and manipulate that, but it's almost too long for that where as the short game never stretches into that territory. To be fair, experience shortens that time span, and quick play helps even further.

The value here is not necessarily action efficiency, but opportunity and operating in the margins where things are profitable and there is a niche to be filled (or more importantly, *will exist at some time* soon). Where there is low supply, there is an opportunity for profit. That you can win with hardly any containers on the island is an interesting twist (although, harder to do if you are using the expansion), and how the economy grows and contracts in macro is fascinating to ponder, especially crashes when people suddenly don't care about buying stuff anymore and valuation plummets. The cash movement can create epic swings (e.g. when do you starve the economy through infrastructure improvements or higher bids for containers being two that come to mind), especially at lower playing counts. Bottoming out isn't necessarily bad, but it can be atrocious if you're not careful. Riding that wave is exhilarating in lots of ways, and is really what makes the game shine. Needs multiple plays to properly evaluate it and I'd warn anyone from forming opinions on the first couple times. As such, it's *much* better with experienced players, but I only have a return rate of about 2/3rds for a second game.

It's a good game as long as you use the sell back rule.  If you don't it can be lights out for some players.  After 3 plays I like the game.  Just wish Valley Games had sent those extra that were promised when I preorder this game.  Could of waited and bought it at my favorite online seller and saved some money.

Как и ожидалось очень глубокая и интересная именно ЭКОНОМИЧЕСКАЯ игра. Единственным минусом, который я ей приписываю -- это при очень качественных элементах не совсем удачная цветовая гамма.

A very good game that also has some issues. We played the beginners' rule that a container can be sold to the supply for 2 dollars, and the game was never going to end. We then abandoned this, and one player (me sadly) badly miscalc'd and got locked out. Also had a problem at the end with no-one willing to buy containers. This said, a novel approach to simulating a free market and definitely worth a second go.

Aptly named, I'm sure many would consider this a dry game - it is after all simply about pushing containers around. The mental gymnastics required to grasp the degrees of separation from creation of an item to eventually landing it as a payoff is daunting.  It's just hard to know how to make them work for a profit although each action is very straight forward. I liked it and it scratched a nice itch. But I'm not longing to play it again.

I really wanted to love this one.  To be frank, the theme is right down my street.  I love ships and the the bits of this are so cool, even if the player areas and island are pretty dull.

I found this game rather boring.  Sure, it's got some good ideas, but they don't stop it from being uninspiring.  All this build, buy, sell just gets tedious.  And it's a mystery how and why you'd get containers from someone else's production onto your dockside.  And what about the get rid of the colour you've got the most of mechanism (a slight borrow from King's Breakfast)?  It seemed a bit adhoc to me.

What a shame!  Actually, I think I have more fun with Mine a Million and Serenissima, which are both second cousins to this one.

RATING: 9
I hear lots of people lament this because the person to the left of them is doing the same thing for cheaper. You have to play your opponents in this game. It's a completely closed economy and the prices players pay for things dictates the strategy to play. It's all about finding a niche and exploiting it. Game just gets better with more plays as players react to previous games.

RATING: 8.101
A very clever economic game. The crucial fact to remember is that there is no bank - money only comes into the game economy from selling goods to the island. If you don't see much goods being shipped you *must* lower your prices otherwise the other players simply will not be able to afford to buy, and the prices for goods ripple through the game. People who complain about "multiplayer solitaire" games should definitely try this one. The designers have done very very well to come up with such a balanced and cogent economic game.

Although I love the game I decided to trade it away since it just wasn't getting enough love. There is always something quicker to play.

Enjoying this a lot, need to play more. A very tactical game wholly dependant on the other players.

If only more people would light up at the chance to push container ships around, is it just me that enjoys that? 

Very boring game if people aren't in to it, need to tailor the crowd well and as such it doesn't get a higher rating for what I think is a wonderfully pure economic game with very simple rules.

Maybe I will re-theme it to try and attract some more interest or at least trick a couple of people in to playing my "new prototype" before they realise they just played container.

Dry, dry, dry.  I sorely wish they had tacked on a different or improved theme.  This thing simply screams "dry."  What could be more fun than shipping metal boxes?  Heck, they could have gone with almost any other theme and I would be happier.  Shipping corpses for medical experiments.  Shipping puppies for mass slaughter by insane mad scientists.  Shipping rainbows for presentation by Care Bears at art exhibits.  I really don't care, just [i]something[/i] else.

The economic engine is somewhat interesting.  You have very limited control over the consumption side since you can't consume your own goods.  This is good and bad, I suppose.  Certainly a departure from other models.

There are relatively few avenues or strategies to pursue.  You can go for factory production, shipping and warehouses or just the auctions.  Fair bit of player interaction via availability of goods, interrelation of the different engine phases and the auctions.

Really this one just didn't impress me.  It felt dry and pretty boring.  I would play it again but it might require some coercion.  My rating would probably be higher if it had a different theme.

RATING: 6
This is a hard to master economic game where you have to build containers and ship them to your island. The main problem is that if you do not play the beginner version, the amount of money available is scarce, so you have to have good trading skills. It`s quite a heavy game, but with simple rules. Micromanagement is the keyword to win.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I really enjoyed the game, but it is not free from great problems. The bid is very risky and can make an unexperienced player destroy the experience of a play. The other aspects of the game are fine, but the bid puts the players in a huge control of the game and it can be problematic in games with unexperienced players.

Economy in a box! As an economic game, it's the best I've ever played: realistic portrayal of the way an economy works with miraculously simple rules create an excellent game. There are all kinds of strategies one can employ, and a player must be quick to know when to change strategies....the economic situation is that fluid. You simply can't play this like any other game, since ruthless competition MUST be tempered by the fact that your opponents are also your customers and suppliers. Quite tense, and (in most cases) it is unclear until the very end who has actually won: looks can be deceiving! Thematically, Container has a very realistic feel to it, and [I originally come from a city with heavy container ship traffic: Halifax, Nova Scotia] the ships and the rest of the game have the RIGHT gritty and grimy feel. The only negative drawbacks production-wise are that the realistic colours are TOO realistic (hard to tell some of them apart); and that I have yet to hear of any copy of Container (including my own) whose player boards are not warped. 
Play-wise, the only mild complaint that I have is that the conditions triggering game end aren't that great. But who cares? It's a glorious game otherwise!

It's got a solid skeleton I actually enjoy, but seems to push itself too far and too long for what it's got. This rating is definitely a floor. If it could keep me more engaged for the whole playing time I think I'd like it a lot more. Perhaps my experience so far could have been anomalous. I'm also wondering if the stretegy of just getting tons of money might be a little too powerful?

Interested in playing with more, our 3p game was quite restrictive. The flow of the game involves multiple transactions between people to even get goods to auction, this forces interaction but I'm not entirely sold on how important the decisions are overall. Blind bidding feels a bit out of place. The rule that you must dump the most numerous type you've collected at the end adds some tension to the type of auction you can bid on, but makes zero sense thematically.

RATING: 8
One of my favorite economic games, player-driven in the best way and super simple though it takes a while to play (2h or so).  Unfortunately, first game is awful unless you have 2 players who know how to keep the economy moving and prevent the game from imploding.

Best with 5, because below that it's a lot harder to get a read on the values of goods since that missing card is a big deal.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A great economic sim, but beware: if the players collectively buy too much infrastructure in the early game, the money supply will deplete and you'll be plunged into a game-long recession. So it replicates a real economy in miniature, one that you can destroy through bad decisions.

3-5(5)

Okay, I played this with, um, a full boat of five players and it's very, very good. Right up my alley.

Of course, it's opaque to many players, especially with the instinct, as in most games, to simply think of immediate, short-term gain. Charging high rates for their factory goods, or their warehouse goods, or whatever. And, of course, as with any auction out there, in the world, not knowing how much to bid on the delivery.

If the economy doesn't crash (and I warn against crashing the economy) then it's just a really interesting ebb and flow of goods, as some players realize they need a lot of orange in the market, say, or that they can get away with gouging on white a bit, or something. And then, of course, that island points don't have to matter. Sure, they're great, but if you're making the island deliveries, you might be splitting the profits risklessly (and with a subsidy!)

And that's the thing, every element of the chain has its own influence on the greater economy. Factories are expensive (and goods sell most cheaply), and there are some restrictions, but they solely determine supply of goods. Warehousing goods acts to filter the supply, at a slightly higher margin. And, of course, shippers have least control over what hits market, and it's the slowest of all, but the margins can (and perhaps often are) amazing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A solid offering, but a bit difficult to explain.  The mechanic is very unique, if not confusing to describe to new players.  Once through the rules the play is quite dynamic with a fair amount of interaction between the players.  Always a good game to hit the table.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
The idea of having to sell your goods to other players feels as though it has great potential to generate an interesting market and a high level of player interaction.  Sadly, Container botches it.  Price your goods higher than other players and watch them gather dust.  The scarcity of a colour doesn't allow you to raise its price because everyone knows they can get just as good a price on the island for any other colours.  The profits on factory and harbour sales are slight and the only real money is to be made from delivering goods to the island.  Hence, the whole production and warehousing part of the game becomes formulaic and constrained by group think.  Like others, I'm unimpressed by the bizarre discard the colour you have the most of end of game rule.  It must be there to fix something but it feels very artificial indeed.

I don't mind the drab, industrial colours of the player boards, but the island looks more like some deserted rock off the coast of Scotland, complete with spatters of bird shit,  than a thriving market for goods. Board warping was an irritation with one of the copies I've played with.

I was pretty excited about Container and got to play it a few times, but it never took off. I find it too dry perhaps because it lacks spatial elements. Sort of feels like a train game without the map and tracks.

Container had some good mechanics, such as three phase procedure Production, Trade to Shipping. It is nicely designed, but for some reason it didn't work for me. Just another boring Eurogame!

Theoretically you could agree beforehand with another player to continual overbidding on the containers. Putting the exorbitant subsidy into your pocket and giving the containers to your henchman, thereby excluding the other players. 

And why dumping the containers on an anonymous island. What's wrong with shipping containers from China to Europe?

I really wanted to like this game.  Nice components interesting layout etc.  But the game itself totally failed to hold my interest, and that was in spite of me [i]winning[/i] the 5-player game we tried.  I didn't care who won - I just wanted it to end...

The game is staggeringly repetitive and overly long for what it is, the decisions are not terribly interesting (when there's even a choice on your turn) and the auctions are a never-ending series of the same boring calculations over and over again in your head - and I usually like auction games.

If I want to look at really cool components for a game that doesn't play well, I'll break out Dread Pirate, which has even cooler looking compoents.  In fact given the choice, I'd rather [i]play[/i] Dread Pirate, and that's saying something.

Container is a distinctive, quirky and amusing game. In Container, the buying and selling of resources must go through several stages, and that makes the game an amusing head scratcher. In particular, the resource cubes you produce from your factory MUST be sold to the other players (at a price you set), who then immediately put them in warehouses on their docks for sale, at prices they set.

These warehoused resource cubes MUST then be sold to someone else in the game for placement on that other player's ship, which then transports them to an island where the shipping player sells them one final time to the highest bidder through blind bidding. The highest bidder then pays the shipper, and places the resource cubes (thrice now bought and sold) in that player's small "destination area" on the island...for eventual, end game scoring.

Twists in the game include dealing out, at the beginning of the game, secret, individualized, "destination area" valuations for each of the resources, and a choice (thank goodness!) on the final blind bidding auction. The shipping seller has the option of taking the high bid from the high bidder PLUS an equal amount of bonus money from the back (a very attractive double payment!) or paying the high bid himself to the bank, and then putting the cubes in his/her destination area, for end game scoring (actually income for each particular cube in that person's "destination area." The person with the most money at the end wins.

On the downside...at times on the first play, Container felt broken, prone to maliciously ignoring players goods for sale (regardless of price), and hopelessly opaque due to the many layers that MUST take place in the game...before a cube reaches its destination where, presumably(?) the game deciding effects take place?

By the end of the first game, I was left wondering which of the hundreds of little transactions in the game were, or were not, decisive in determining the outcome of the game. This game probably comes into much greater focus after a few plays...which is a good thing in a game really.

All in all a very nice game, at least for gamers.

A strong economic game.  Both micro- and macroeconomics play a significant role.  Pricing decisions are key, but so is keeping the overall economy flush with enough cash (at the right times) to buy your goods.  Underneath the surface this is really a game about tempo and player incentives, but this is not necessarily clear from the outset.

Suffers from similar problems as Modern Art: weak players can destroy the economy and/or throw the game.  It is almost never advisable to buy your own goods, but since it is an option, many players are tempted.

Although the theme is a little "dry", it's a very interesting game from its economical aspect.

More Valley Games fun: warped player boards, hate the colors, the boats don't match, had a missing factory and got horrible support trying to replace it.  Hrmph.

I have since run into Planet Steam, and prefer its market AND its board play.

Here's a game I expected to dislike, but found myself quite enjoying as I lost. As with most auction and/or economic engine games, those with less experience lose to those with more, but at least I could see what was going on by the time everything was all over with. Maybe with a few more plays I can become more adept at identifying what kinds of containers everyone is looking for... Looking forward to playing it again.

Feels like a semi-cooperative game at first in the sense that players mutually rely on a common market that can all to easily sink into a recession (read: 3+ hour game).  After a few plays, however, I see that it is not so much cooperative as codependent (edit: check out my [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/49546/coopetition-the-best-of-the-best-of-both-worlds]coopetition geeklist[/url]). A considerable amount of hidden information makes this a real bluffing game.  This is a great game.

This is not a game for non-gamers.  Tight money and can be unforgiving.  The aspects that I like about rail games.  Probably not enough variety for many people, but if you like this sort of game it's very good.  Very dry,  I'm not sure why this game isn't more appealing to me, but for some reason playing this game feels too much like doing homework.

I've heard that a lot of the container ships have been chipped out of the box, and that people are having a hard time getting damaged ships replaced.  That's one thing that's keeping me from buying the game.  Something like that would drive me nuts.

With everyone playing their first game no-one had any real idea what things should be worth most of the time. That led to a lot of overthink I believe.
I wouldn't be surprised if another play drops my rating at least a point.

RATING: 6
An interesting economic game.  It clearly pays to be out of sync with the other players,  but it does require them to play ball to take advantage of this.  Ganging up on a player is definitely possible,  but at some cost to the other players.  The game was enjoyable,  but simply a bit too long (about 2 hours after we got the rules done).  This might come down with experience,  but might not if no-one built factories.  I'd be happy to play again,  as there is definitely a challenge in here,  but I don't think this will break into the set of games that I will actively seek out.

Boards are warped,  but this doesn't really affect play - I'm not convinced it would be easy to straighten them though - the warping is in 2 dimensions and severe.

One play,  with the advanced rules!!  (And I won,  so no sour grapes involved.)

Very god game. Very easy rules. It is a nice streamlined economic simulation: manufacturing goods -> selling it to a middle man -> selling it on to be shipped to an oversea's market.
The only downside is that the production value (colour choices, graphic design) has a lot of room for improvement. The gameplay can also be a bit repetitive, however the game does not overstay it's welcome.

Played a variant with production every term to cure the perceived shortfall of goods experienced by those who had played it previously.  Unfortunately this killed the market.  The price setting had some similarities to Key Harvest, except that you cannot acquire your own goods.  Graphics not great, especially the centre island.  The game idea is clever but for me does not quite work.

Сама по себе игровая механика шикарна. Все полностью зависит от игроков за столом, вот только помоему при кажущемся равенстве игроков на старте все не так безоблачно как выглядит на первый взгляд. Игрок "производитель" по сути определяет насыщенность рынка определнным ветом контейнеров... вообщем надо играть -смотреть...

Outstanding game! Simple rules that permit deep strategy within a resolutely tactic game. The secret scoring card sufficiently limits informations, and I think it should be played with open money (home rule). It is the only way to gauge the market and intentionally affect other players.

The game has one big issue: bad components! Colors don't match and containers are hues of orange, hardly distinguishables for many people (in my group two players are color-blinds). I modified one color by putting a white stripe in the middle of each pieces. In all, it took me an hour and it makes the game much more playable.

Just read the rules and it is pretty interesting.  The rules are clean and streamlined.  I found no ambiguities and no forgotten situations.  The game sounds pretty meh at the moment though, since I can't really visualize the game play.  Well, I can't find the exciting part or times to have clever moves.  I guess the heart and soul of the game is setting the right prices for the containers and valuing each shipment that goes to the island properly.  So in essence it's a game of glorified market stands, which you are the producer and seller and buyer at the same time.  It seems to me though that it would really suck to be the player that has the same initial color machine that someone just made in their island .  This increases supply so your potential profit for others creating your initial color container just plummeted relative to other players' containers.  I am wondering if the game goes on long enough (as far as turns go) that you can recover from poor pricing.  I guess I get now how the more players you have the more chaotic the game gets and with less players the more strategic it becomes.  With too many players, it doesn't give players enough chances to react to the market.  The rule that you dump your most single quantity color container is very interesting.  It forces everyone to get each color container and even have the most of the least profitable container so that they don't lose too much money for dumping.  Actually writing all of this has focused my thoughts and think it is a pretty good game just from the rules.  Looking forward to this.  I am not sure if I will preorder the game or not yet though.  I'll vacillate over this and hopefully make a decision before the end of the month.

After much reading, rereading the rules and seeing the reactions people have about this game, I will "Try Before Buy."  I am even leaning on "Do Not Buy" due to its fragility.  The game tries to employ laissez-faire but it just doesn't work, so I hear.

ok, I admit it: I absolutely suck at this game. no matter what I try, it's always not my colors being moved around.

regardless of the above, the game can either work pretty well, or fall completely flat. for me it's 50-50. when it falls flat it's 2 hours of waiting for game end, and I am just not willing to risk that too often in the future

This is a game I really want to like, but for some reason it just don't work with me. After reading the rules it looks like a very daring game. The main problem occurs if everbody bids very low on your ship. The game ended in a kind of impasse. There came no fresh money in the game. The second problem seems to be the loans. It is very difficult to get rid of a loan, mostly you're in a negative spiral taking one.

I liked this, but I'm not sure how fragile this economy is.  Anyone that overbids a lot will have that magnified by the matching amount from the bank.  There's no controlling what others load on their boats which can put you in a tough spot depending on what your colors are valued at on your goal card.

3 playings with 4, 1 with 5.  Very "thinky" with interlocking parts which are at first difficut to understand.  Very similar in evaluating proper value to Modern Art, or at least it seems to me (I stink at Modern Art). Looking forward to additional plays.  Components are remarkable.  Really need to play this more frequently as the game is quite opaque and trying to remember the "lessons learned" from long ago is quite challenging.

Crazy economics engine. Played it several times so far, can't wrap my head around any dominant strategies. Doesn't play nearly as well with 3 as it does with 4 or 5. Biggest problem is, I always lose so now my Nephew (who always wins, and since he lives with me is part of my gaming group 95% of the time) doesn't want to play it because he doesn't want to break the streak after about 15 plays in a row of him winning and me losing.

RATING: 7
The one game I played lasted about 3 hours.  It is a economics game.  Without getting too much into the rules, the main point of the game that allows for the unique player interactions is the different hidden values that each container is worth to each player.  This integrated with a blind bid, allows for some unique player interaction.

It was fun, and the re-playability comes from different players.  The game has only minimum randomness and only at the start.

Seems like a really good economic game.  I'll have to play it again before I know how much I like it, but the first play was interesting with some different strategies at the table.  Seemed like everyone was paying a lot at the island for how much money they'd get back at the end of the game.  I spent most of my time delivering to the island and collecting profits.  I only won two bids at the island 9 for two chocolate (black) and 12 for two sugar (white), earning me 20 at game end.  Again, unless you're diversified from buying throughout the game, it was hard to justify spending... I lost money buying on the island.

NO rating yet because I am not sure.... Our first 3 player game locked up when a player tried to hike the price on an auction, expecting me to pay for the cargo when in fact I took their bid. The rest of the game would have been torture for that player since there seemed to be no way for them to service their loans and make any progress at all. We gave up...

A good game save for its length.  Our 5-player beginners'-rules game with everyone pretty much new, including rules questions during gameplay, took almost four hours.  It was interesting though repetitive.

The game is very long and unforgiving, and I am usually pretty unforgiving myself of games like this.  But its perfectly calculable nature, though not helping game length, did make it easier for me to see the relative worth of things, so I was able to do better at it than I would have expected.

There were very poor graphic design choices here, as well, I must say.

With the right amount of polish this game could have been deserving of top-fifty status here on BGG.  The core is awesome but it didn't get that polish the other excellent games here would have gotten.

RATING: 7
First impressions were quite favorable, it really felt like a breakthrough in economic games.  Here the players were organically creating the economy, controlling and pricing nearly every aspect of production and retail.  It certainly blew my mind at the time.

As the number of plays grew I noticed that my initial infatuation had diminished.  The game is not short and the game doesn't have a strong narrative.  The beginning and end of the game are not much different, the number of goods from a player's factory store that you buy at once merely increased as the game goes on.

This is not a killer for me as the organic economy idea is still extremely novel.  Unfortunately, by putting so much in the hands of the players, the game is very susceptible to group think.  Factory goods are never placed for more than 2 or 3, harbor goods for 3 or 4.  As such the profit margins are almost entirely in shipping given a normal bid is about 3 a container.

Now, ideally people would realize this and more people would move into shipping and those still in production and retail could raise prices.  This, sadly, never happens and it makes our games play out very similarly.  I sometimes mention this (subtly, I am already known as the overbearing know-it-all) after our games and the other players agree, but nothing seems to change.  There just appears more pressure to keep prices lower in the factory and harbor store and no similar disincentives in the shipping auction.

So the idea of Container appeals a lot more than actually playing it at this point.

The game doesn't have balance issues. It's just that it doesn't really work when players don't follow their economic best choices, and those can be somewhat hard to see for a beginner.

For an example, when you buy your own shipment in the island, you actually pay 3 times as much as the highest bid: you forfeit double (the amount plus the money from the bank) and have to pay that amount to the bank.

With the gold containers from the expansion it becomes a 10. Fantastic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Wow, this is a weird game.  Hard to tell what is a good play, and it is chaotic enough that it might not matter.  Multiple layers of buying and selling plus regular under-cutting of prices makes my head hurt.  I guess the blind bid auctions for the containers really destroys my respect for the game... it is hard to figure out how much a lot is worth to your opponents... and then you'll probably lose the blind auction by a dollar.  There is a general lack of control and a dependence on your opponents to make rational auction bids and make sensible business decisions (i.e., not build an X factory 2 other people have X factories and a Y factory is clearly needed).

Container is a pretty unforgiving economic simulation.  Just like a "real" economy, public sentiment can drive the economy just as much as prices and availability do.  This little aspect can be frustrating for some people, but I've always enjoyed a little bit of diplomacy in my games.  The components for this game are complete crap though... warped boards and chipped ships and I was even shorted an Orange container in my copy, so had to make one on my own since the quantities are critical to determine when the game ends. Do _NOT_ play this with 3 people.  Two players will tend to feed off each other and the third will get totally hosed.  That's not a game, it's a popularity contest.

A pretty clear cut economic game of produce, store, buy, ship and price gauging with a somewhat tacked on hidden bonus objective. Large parts of how the game plays out is group think and that means sometimes control just slips through your fingers. At other times you need to keep still because your opponents seem to do the things that benefit you most.

It's a solid design, but the influence on the chain of multiple economic parts is hard to master. I'm not a fan of the scoring mechanism also. In the end I think it's a bit dry and that's what counts; The amount of fun you have while playing.

There is something fundamentally wrong with the flow/play of this game. I enjoyed playing it, but the idea that you must sell to other players only to purchase your own unimproved product back bothers me very much. Not to mention that competition is not inspired in the game and the idea of supply/demand price fluctuations is not borne out the way I would like to see it. I now know that building large production/warehousing capacity is best left to "someone else;" just scoop up those goods and sell em at auction. 

I enjoyed playing it and will play again, so I'll keep it at 7 for now. This was a game I was extremely jazzed about and I'm pretty relieved I never got around to buying before trying.

Played this at Essen '07.  After waiting hours to get in a demo I was underwhelmed by Container.  It turns out to be another economic euro with no soul.  Sure as a design project the idea of a totally player driven economy is compelling, but when you actually play the game you keep asking yourself, "is this fun?"  For me that answer was a resounding "no".  I was glad when the game was over and may I never play it again.

I'm not fond of mechanisms that forces players to choose when to end the game since only a player that think that he is in the lead would take that action. But the victor is not always obvious in this game so it can work anyway, it's just not as interesting when it's not so even.

Otherwise it's a wonderful design where players really make the game.

Have only played iths once and that game was 3 player.  Hoewver, I have to agree with another BGGer's description -- the game is sublime.  It's the first game I've played that felt like it had a truly player-created economy.  I lost (and am not sure why) but clearly the player who beat me just made better economic decisions.  I can't wait to play this again!

After 3 plays, I've decided this is a game that I should love more than I do love.  Don't get me wrong.  It's a great game.  It mirrors n economy excellently.  However, it requires the right players to make it work and I just don't see myself getting to play it often with the right people.

Juego económico de producción de mercancías, compra-venta y después entrega en una isla.  Cada jugador, puede producir tantas mercancías como fábricas tenga, a las que se les asigna un precio de venta.Los otros jugadores, pueden comprar esas mercancías y ponerlas a la venta (con mejor precio normalmente) en  los puertos, donde pueden acudir los barcos a cargarlas para llevarlas a la isla. En la isla, cuando llega un barco, se realiza una subasta oculta y el vendedor puede optar por venderlo al mejor postor (y recibir un incentivo de la banca) o pagar el mismo la mejor puja y quedarse los contairnes para él. 
La mecánica es atractiva, pero por la única partida jugada y comentarios leídos, el juego no está bien diseñado. Se pueden dar situaciones de hundimiento del mercado que echan por tierra toda la partida. Esto hace que le de una puntuación bastante baja.

Really dig the way this micro-economy works. Though it runs longer than many Euros, you won't notice. With only two actions per turn, the time flies by. Avoid the stupid "Beginner's Variant", as it may vastly extend the playtime. Unlike many "development" Euros, this game actually punishes an excess of infrastructure. Specialization seems to be the best idea, but I'll need more plays to really settle on this and a final BGG rating. I love those resin freighter models!

I SO wanted to like this game!  The game's not that complicated -- you manufacture goods and put them in your manufacturing storage, and then you have warehouse storage at your docks where goods can be loaded onto ships, and then you have your ship which needs to take goods from docks to a central island where they'll be auctioned. The part that had all of us asking, "Really? Are you sure?" is that you can't just move your goods from your manufacturing facility to your docks or from your docks to your ship. Clearly, that would be crazy! Instead, you have to hope that other people manufacture stuff and put it on sale at a reasonable price at their manufacturing facility. Then you have to hope that other people buy the manufactured products and put them on sale at a reasonable price at their docks so you can take your ship over and load stuff up. Um... okay... I admit that it wouldn't be much of a game if you could do the logical thing, but it didn't feel like much of a game anyway.  I normally love dry games, but this one left me feeling like I'd eaten sawdust.

This one is a bit counter-intuitive and a bit frustrating since you'll never really feel like you have complete control over what you're doing (e.g. you can't force players to buy your stock, you have to entice them with competitive prices) but it is a refreshing change from the same tired bidding/trading/sale mechanics that bog down some eurogames.

Essentially you head a company that handles everything from producing goods to shipping them to their final destination. The way the buying/selling mechanics work reflect how there is a markup on price as the containers get closer to reaching their final destination.

Also, the boats are awesome!

NOTE: [b]This is NOT a game for color-blind people![/b] Even those without vision problems can have a hard time distinguishing the different container colors in bad lighting.

Played a prototype at GoF 2005.  I didn't like it.  The economic system relies on everyone being able to evaluate the value of the goods effectively and to build appropriately as a group to keep the market going.  If someone doesn't do these things they throw the game to some other player who receives their goods for a huge profit, or the game stalls out.  Maybe the final version will address these things but I doubt it - it seems an integral part of the game design.

I pre-ordered a copy, but it didn't arrive until late January 2008 (nearly two months after most people who pre-ordered got their copies), and my copy didn't have the plastic containers until late June 2008

Meanwhile, I really like the game, and would probably only turn it down if time was short. It's a subtle economic engine game that [i]looks like[/i] it moves slowly (albeit with fairly fast turns), but I think there's some real strategic depth here in figuring out how to get the high point value containers onto your section of the island without selling too cheaply from your factory and harbor stores or incurring too much debt. I also think it would be a good game to use as a longer (two hour) gateway game as a replacement for Monopoly. For this, I think Container might even be a better fit than Acquire. Great game!

RATING: 9
UPDATE: The expansion recommends taking out one container of each color per player for a shorter version of the game. To me, this seemed perfect to produce a "normal" game, and I highly recommend it. 
---
UPDATE: Just for the record, for me this game is a personal '10'; I think it's great. But I also can't deny that there are a couple points of instability, as noted below, so in the interests of objectivity I'll keep my rating at a 9.
---
UPDATE: I've been asked how "fragile" container really is, and it's a tricky question. Players certainly can cause problems. The #1 problem is for an individual player to over-invest in infrastructure, get stuck with $20 in debt, and be out of it. But that's a pretty easy trap to avoid if you make any effort at all. The second problem is if everyone invests in factories early, siphoning a bunch of money out of the game and stalling things out. Again, pretty easy to avoid if you're thinking about things at all, and If even one player expands their warehouse capacity, though, this should not be an issue. The third problem would actually be substantial *under*-investment in factories. This means fewer goods being produced, and a game that potentially goes too long. Container wants to be about 90 minutes, and most of my games have been, but one game where only one player made significant investment in factories (the factories were 4,2,1,1) went longer than was really comfortable. This seems an easier trap to fall in to.

Anyway, this is a game where you need a good eye for investments, and if the players don't correct for imbalances in the overall economy (by building factories when production is short, or building warehouses when that is the bottleneck), things can go awry. Not badly awry, but it can make the game longer than it ideally should be if some element of the economy becomes a bottleneck and that opportunity is not exploited.

I don't like the "sell a container for $2" beginner rule, because I think it messes up the incentives of the game and can make the game longer, so I've been trying to think of better ways to kick-start the game and ensure that Container comes in at 90min or less. One idea I like is to start everyone with a container in the warehouse priced at $4, in addition to their factory and good. Another option I considered was to give everyone $30 at start instead of $20. Since it's a game of margins more than reinvestment, it seems like the extra $10 at start shouldn't mess things up too badly, and should ensure a fast start.

Wonderful game; one of my favorites of 2007, and it was a good year.

I like Container a lot because it's such a subtle game: you need to get a read on what other players are doing and fill undervalued niches. There are legitimate ways to make money in shipping, warehousing, and production, and the game is all about balancing many factors and figuring out who wants what and pricing appropriately. Unlike most economic games, it's not about building infrastructure or figuring out the economic rules; it's more like Modern Art, it's about figuring out where there is money to be made and what the other players are up to. The great thing is that where that is will change as the game goes on as players adjust and adapt. You can't stick with a strategy, you have to be constantly flexible. I also love the fact that money is so tight and margins so low, you really need to manage your money carefully and winning the game relies on consistent good play rather than a couple windfalls. I also like how the game develops and goes through phases of growth and shifting markets, but how it does so organically, with a very clean game system and without any awkward phasing rules.

I've heard some complaints about analysis paralysis, but this really should not be an issue if you play properly (hidden cash, sealed bids).

I suspect that this is a game that may actually appeal more to the broader community of gamers than to the BGG types. I would have few qualms about playing this with interested but non-hobbyist gamers, where I would *never* sucker them with Age of Steam, Power Grid, or Brass. Container is a pretty intuitive game, much more evocative of real economics and much more strongly thematic than the more "gamerly" economic games. And the playing time of 75-90 minutes is perfect.

Couple tips:
If you are teaching the game for the first time, make sure you explain to new players that debt is very expensive, and is meant for short-term liquidity, not for long-term investment. Margins in this game are low, and 10% interest is pretty high. New players should avoid debt like the plague unless they absolutely know where income to repay it is coming from within a turn or two.
Also, you should go first, buy a warehouse, and buy a container from another player to kick off the game. This will grease the skids of the economy and ensure a clean start; a common misunderstanding is for players to greatly over-value factories early, which can stall out the game as too much cash is siphoned off. As long as even just one player gets shipping going early everything will be fine, but because Container is different from many currently-popular euros (Power Grid, Age of Steam, Puerto Rico) where it's  impossible or essentially impossible to lose money, its easy to have some misconceptions. In Container, it's not uncommon for shipping or production runs to be minimally or un-profitable. The reference game here should be Modern Art, not Power Grid.
I have some more tips in a general article in the game forum.

Also, some fans of Age of Steam and similar games are playing variants where cash is open and bidding is once-around or continuously-around. Now, I'm not going to tell people how to enjoy games, and some people have a genuine, blanket dislike for hidden cash and sealed bids in *any* context for whatever reason. But playing this way is playing some other game, not Container. Cash is secret and the auctions are blind bid here for extremely good reasons. Having said this, play whichever way you enjoy, but if you're playing with folks who play this way and don't see what the big deal is, it's because important elements of the game have been ripped out.

RATING: 6
This game is a bit of an odd duck since it seems like there can be really good games and really bad games, depending on how the players play.

Essentially, in Container, players are generating goods into a warehouse which they then sell to someone else.  That player puts those goods into his shipyard, where they are then bought by another player and loaded onto their ship.  That player then sails off to deliver the goods which are auctioned off to the highest bidder.  At that point, the highest bidder keeps those goods for endgame scoring.

So, there are a bunch of levels where players will profit off the goods at various stages of the cycle.  Players set their own prices throughout the process, so there's a lot of undercutting going on, as cash flow is key to the game.  However, undercutting too much just allows other players to get stuff for dirt cheap, so there's a lot of group think that ends up going into the pricing schemes.

Since everything in this game is up to the players, from the availability of goods to the pricing of them, to who you decide to do your buying from, the game has potential to get pretty ruthless.  It's very possible to get yourself into a situation of being low on cash, and find that everyone just abandons you to watch you drown in debt.  This really makes it a game that isn't going to be fun for everyone, as essentially being out of the game could kind of stink.

However, I kind of enjoyed it for what it was.  It almost seems like a social/market experiment as much as it is a game, providing the framework for the various market interactions without any game mechanisms to drive it.  Depending on the players, this could either go well or be a disaster, so it's definitely a game that needs to be tried to see if it works for you.

Very interesting mechanic.  We greatly enjoyed a first play though clearly we hadn't quite figured out the strategies.  What is disappointing though is that the high quality pieces have horrible colors!!  Also, the tan and brown pieces can be fairly indistinguishable at a distance.  Still despite a horrible appearance as fun game.
Second play it was great!  Definitely requires a full contingent of players (5)

[u]October 09:[/u] Just 1 play yet, 3p... Well we all went bankrupted... So this was interesting, unfortunately, I didn't have the opportunity to check out what I wanted... At least, we know what our mistakes were and next time, it should go fine... I still have big hopes on this one!

[u]January 10:[/u] Second game, still didn't really see everything I wanted but at least we didn't go bankrupt. However, both of my opponents had forgotten a rule that kind of falsified the auctions (coz' I hadn't forgotten the rule so I didn't understand how they could auction this high!). Anyway, still not convinced on this one, I believe it will take me at least 2 or 3 more plays (correct ones mind!) to form a real opinion. For the moment however, none of these 2 unfortunate plays killed my excitement...

I think there are some nice interactive buying and selling mechanics here. There is not much downtime between turns(depending on who you're playing with) and the decision making is ok. The turns start to feel repetitive as the game progresses because players seem to focus on one aspect and continue to do that every turn. Also, there is no catch up mechanic, I was in last the entire game and no decision would of helped. The game seems a bit too long, it kind of dragged on towards the end. With all that said, I can see why some people would like this game, because the interactions between players are good. I wouldn't mind playing again or every now and then.

RATING: 9
This game does not get the love that it truly deserves.  This is a very tight economic game, but unlike some economic games, it does not require an "engine" as your profit is not self-driven, but driven by what everyone else does.  There is a very tight balance between "spending" money to build an infrastructure, but "saving" money to be able to buy the large "Foreign Island" purchases.  Then, of course, the ability to outbid your opponents for your own shipment is an occassionally "coup de grace" that can have an immense swing in the game (either to one's benefit, or complete detriment).

A very well done game that one must dedicate a decent amount of time to playing, but can be an ultimately rewarding excercise.

After one play, I can see a lot of potential in the system that is based almost entirely on player interaction.  I really like how the game system allows the players to dictate how the game will evolve, creating a lot of small tactical decisions such as how to price your goods in the market and when to buy these goods and from whom. The money can be really tight in this game which makes what actions you take carry a lot of weight.  Can't wait to play again. 

Why are we shipping all these delicious goods to a small Island again???

RATING: 6
Let's start this rating with an "8." I had heard that the economic system in this game is "fragile," and I can see where extreme choices could cause some wonky results. Still, I really enjoyed this first play. Every turn, a player takes two actions, and there's essentially four choices. The rules are pretty straightforward, but the brain starts to hurt when you start to figure out how to get those containers you want from production to storage to shipment to arrival. You can't do it yourself; you need to incentivize others to help you.

A group of people probably need to play this game a couple of times to learn how to value diffferent things. And, none of us priced any containers on the higher end. I'd be curious to see what happens when things get expensive! This is worth trying some more.

Update: more than a year went by since I last played this. And, the game still strikes me as one of the more unique economic games around. A highlight of the game is the way it forces interdependence between players. Those simultaneous blind bids for shipments are pretty critical, and the player that valuates those best will likely come out ahead. The only knock for me is play length, and the endgame condition kinda causes the game to conclude with a whimper. Still, it's a unique game that's great to play once in a while.

Update: OK, so I played this twice, and each time I enjoyed the game... mostly. However, upon reflection, twice both games seemed to drag a little too long, and the game ended with a bit too much of a whimper. The economic system is really slick, but I think I admire the game more than I enjoy playing it. This is another one of those games where I'll be happy to play someone else's copy, but I don't need to own this.

A different game mechanic with having to buy stuff from other people so they can buy from you. The hoarding tactic doesn't work in this game because you want other people to have money to spend. You just have to make sure you have enough money to spend when it comes time for an auction.

An interesting economic simulation from the late, great Franz-Benno Delonge.

Typical oddball, half baked Valley Games components.  What is it with colors now-a-days?  Blue ships are black, white ships are green, and all the frickin' goods are "brown" it seems.

Still I was surprised how much I enjoyed the game and would definitely play again.  Which isn't to say it was phenomenal, just that it was good and I expected mediocre.   I suspect that once the newness wears off, this will be just another game that's too long for the enjoyment it delivers.

update, two months have passed, and the group has yet to play again ... not a good sign for a young game.

Only played this 1 time and am wondering if it will ever play again. First off the bits and pieces were all over the place. The ships are fantastic and the wooden pieces all well made, but the pieces are all to closely colored and very hard to distinguise and the boards are flimsy and are all cut poorly. When reading the rules I knew this game was going to make peoples head's hurt and it did. It plays uniquely but just leaves a whatever taste in your mouth. I think that the creators did this: "Hey, lets make a game with really cool pieces...uhoh that was expensive, better go a little cheap on the other stuff. We have a real good game idea but lets make this great idea not to fun to play". Well, thats what I think. Maybe if it gets played again it might feel different....if it gets played again. 

Overall Score 6, Appearence 6, Components 5, The Box (storage) 7, Rulebook 7, Ease of Play 6, Mechanics 7, Involvment 8, Replayability 7, Uniqueness 9, Luck 2 v Strategy 8 (The higher the number the more it leans that way.)

RATING: 10
Update (8/21/09): After two more games with five players, this time with open money, I bumped this up to a 10. I don't know if I'd play any other way now. The decisions got tougher with more information. With open money you're playing the other players, not trying to get the most cash. It opens up a whole new pallette of choices in an already amazingly rich game. I am still always struck by how a limited set of options each turn can have such disparate consequences. The butterfly effects are a marvel to behold. And with open money you actually get to watch them with greater understanding.

Old comments: Midway through my first game, I turned to the guys sitting next to me (not in our game, a CCGer) and blurted, "I am deeply in love with this game." That is a good sign. And I am still in love. I see it going to a 10 soon.

I love the way the game flows. The dynamics of the player interaction make it a constantly shifting challenge. And it is beautiful. I can't stop thinking about it. Another good sign.

RATING: 9
This is a hard game.  Little is obvious.  Most of it is sympathetic rather than directly causal.  Pleasantly unstable, very emergent, more tactical than strategic, but 2-3 turn look-ahead is still required.

Considerably better than I expected.

The core pattern is determining which market segment in the game ie being underserved either through insufficient production or pricing and then occupying that slot profitably.  The game then iterates on that specific.  Ensuring that your container collection on the island is scoring optimised is surprisingly difficult as it relies on incentivising emergent player collusion.  There are many slightly underhandedly sympathetic tricks in this space.  Delightful.  

Don't be scared of loans.  Realise that they are simply sources of temporary liquidity and treat them as such.

Note: Actions are not the most valuable resource.  Really.  Opportunity is the primary resource constraint. 

Update: We replaced with blind bidding for containers with an open auction.  Loans may be taken in turn order before the auction starts, raise or or pass, pass == out of auction, highest bid wins.  The resulting auctions are only marginally slower than the blind bid auctions, but more importantly the winning bid values are much more regular and thus the result auctions are far more interesting.    Highly recommended.  Rating left at 8.5 with open auctions.  Rating with blind bidding drops to 7.0.

Update: We replaced the open auction with a once-around.  As Chris Farrell said, the open auction lost too much information about the player's wants.  Much improved.  Rating now at 8.5 with once-around.  Rating with open auctions: 7.5.  Rating with blind bidding: 7.0.  

That all said this may yet prove to be the one game that I think is actually worth playing with bind bidding.  There's a layer of important signalling that is lost even with once-around that is preserved with blind bids.

Update: Finally back to blind bidding.  The last dozen and a half games have been played with the traditional blind bidding.  I was convinced by Chris Farrell's arguments around the information content of bids to go back to blind bidding and, well, he's right.  The informational signalling in the blind bidding is critical to the design.  However i strongly disagree with his contentions on closed money, only play with open money and will not consider playing otherwise.  If you insist on playing with closed money then I'll quite happily pull out pencil and paper and broadcast each player's holdings every turn until y'all see sense.

Update: Continues to grow on me.  Far more subtle and yet controllable than I'd suspected.  Really quite an amazing design.  Currently rated at 8.5.  There's good potential of a 9.0 rating at this point.  I'm not sure why I'm holding back.

RATING: 8
Stunning game of supply and demand that only improves as players become more familiar with its rhythms. Very susceptible to groupthink, which I consider one of the game's strongest features. This is not a game to play with a group that plays a serious 'metagame.' This sadistic game encourages you to put yourself in a weak position, and then turns around and makes it easy and profitable for your opponents to abuse you. The blind bidding, like everything else in the design, is excellent and vicious.

Physical production quality is a mixed bag. Playing with "secret" money really just means you're wasting everyone's time, so the cards, while pretty, aren't very practical. Poker chips or even Puerto Rico-like money are the way to go. The game's six small boards warp so seriously they put Railroad Tycoon to shame. The wooden blocks are mostly OK, but a few of them are chipped or only half-width, &c. The ships are wonderful. The graphic design is excellent, and I very much appreciate the risky art even when it's not entirely successful. We did not have problems with the colors of the components, but I suppose I can understand those who do.

1 play, I like it a lot. Excellent components (those ships -wow!), nice game flow, a good balance of methodical plodding, tricky maneuvering, group think economics, and blind bidding. However, I have so many games with an auction element, I'm tired of the mechanic, and I turn slightly away from good games with auctions towards good games that don't. This is not a negative criticism of the game, just the carpet I stand on.

I love everything about the economy.. the booms and busts... the niches players try to corner... the collusion... it just seems like such a simple, elegant, and clever system.  This is the first game of its kind I've ever played; where the economic system is totally in the hand of the players.  It is eye opening to watch one player spiral the system down into a depression.  This game has a strong element of timing in it... you want to make sure those that want your goods are flush with cash when you are selling to maximize your profits.  The ebbs and flows of cash flow in this game is an amazing thing to behold.  Picking up on the early auction signaling is one key to maximizing late game shipment windfalls.  This game is groupthink personified, and I love it.

Rules are a bit difficult and for an economic game it has some rules that don't really make sense economically (i.e. in the real world).  But what the heck, moving containers around from port to port and dropping them on an island was never so much fun.  An extra 1/2 pt. for the cool resin freighters and the funky industrial colors.

RATING: 5
Container is a multi-faceted economic game where players can produce containers, sell containers to ships from their warehouses, and ship containers to the central island, all of which can provide income. The goal of the game is to have a collection of containers that are valuable to you, which is determined by a randomly given out point value card at the start of the game and remains hidden from the other players for the duration of the game.

I really was looking forward to playing this, and I found it disappointing in practice. The mathematics all boil down to small scale nickel and diming action, and the auctions for the containers at the island tend to boil down to the person whom they are worth the most to bidding a higher amount, and logically winning it. The "most containers are discarded" rule tends to muddy the waters to some extent, but I still found this to be an issue. I found the overall feel of the game to be on the repetitive side as well, not much difference from round to round.

I can understand how groups could greatly affect the way the game plays: i.e.: collusion between factory owners to price up, collusion between warehouse holders to price up...but in groups that refuse to all understand the fundamentals of how the pricing system works, things seem to break down and the only profit to be made is via shipments to the island, which are already lucrative because of the matching money payout scheme. I would argue that it would be even problematic for one player to be under-pricing relative to the rest of the table at either of the two major container points of purchase (factory / warehouse) because then their left hand neighbour would benefit disproportionately from their bad play (if they were smart enough to notice at least) and the other players would meanwhile be sinking in a relative sense...thus, the entire group has to be on the same page with pricing structures, and if they aren't, one maverick seems as though they could throw the game. Maybe if I, and at least 2 other friends liked this game enough we could play it regularly and start to create more interesting play patterns, but as an occasional play, this game seems to create very dull patterns of price increment creep.

I think there is the basis of a really good game here...if the container value was some sort of player controlled market, or something along those lines I think the game would gain measurably. I also think the blind sell at the island could use some sort of patch as well, but that would probably go along with the different way to value the containers. As it stands, I find the game a disappointment. Not bad, not below average, but not nearly as exciting as I felt it could be.

Container is a game about big ships and big production. Each player will play both as a producer and shipper of goods. Players will decide which products they want to produce, and which of the OTHER player's goods they want to ship out to a remote island. During these phases, players will be able to set the prices for their goods and try to maximize their cash!

Ouch, further two points drop. Played the game after a long pause and realized that I do not enjoy it much (despite winning this particular game). I like games with negotiations or 'talkative' interaction, e.g. Modern Art or Game of Thrones. Container is all about interdependence, which is a sort of interaction, but it feels dry and boring. Second, I also like games where I can plan ahead and build my little 'world', e.g. Agricola. You cannot build your own thing in Container or plan ahead much. Maybe you could if all persons involved did understand the game very well and made always rational decisions. However, this has never happend in my experience. 

I still appreciate the game as a simulation of economics.

-----
After 6 more plays, I am knocking a point off. The game encourages analysis(-paralysis). This in turn results in too much downtime in a 4-5 player game. You cannot think ahead because the optimal move usually depends on other players' actions. A 3 player game is not as good for another reason: more players are needed to create a dynamic supply and demand, 

-----
Initial impression (3 plays)

Very interesting economic simulation with lot of player interaction. Demonstrates why there are so many market "failures" - occasionally people just act irrationally and this may wreck your plans. (Occasionally, this may wreck the whole game too.) The rules are relatively simple. The boards and ships are functional but look quite bad for such an expensive game.

Interesting abstract economic game in which players create and sell goods to one another.  The goal is to be the player with the most cash at the end.  This can be achieved in two ways.  First, by operating on margin.  Goods must be priced low enough to sell, but high enough to earn a profit.  Additional end-game cash is given for a user's goods stored on the island.  The value of these is calculated according to a secret scoring card received during game set up.

Feb. 10, 2009 -- I really do enjoy pure economics games, even if I'm not very good at them. Container is very much a pure economics game. Although the game is completely different from Modern Art, it has the same kind of feel, where new players have no idea the value of things and can really make a mess of the game's economy. This led to my first game (one experienced player and two inexperienced player) being an incredibly odd game (or so I was told). I think my rating will improve with further plays. 7/10

Ah the joys of a closed economy. Seriously though, don't invest in much infrastructure at the outset of the game if anyone at the table has suicidal tendencies.

This game is much improved upon by playing with open money. Do not play with 3 unless the players are experienced, plays best with 5.

RATING: N/A
I don't think this game is for me. As a newcomer I have no right to comment on a game which takes several plays at least for players to get a 'feel' for it, let alone work out some strategies—but I'll take a cheap shot just the same. 

No, I'm not going to argue that the game is broken or that there is an overpowered strategy, or whatever. I very much doubt it is, since it is all up to the players to work out how they are going to drive the game. One major part of the game is creating opportunities for others to give you money, and making some cash off of that. It really is okay to lose money on production and warehousing, as long as you make up in the final auction. Loans are scary, but can help you get up to speed easily. Another part is controlling the speed of the game. You can't ship more containers to the island than the financial state of your competitors allows: if you do you're presenting deals too good to be true, and losing money—even if it doesn't seem like you are. It is hard for newcomers to have any idea on how to make these concepts work in practice; and more importantly, make them work without extensive deliberation. (Of course, nothing is what it seems in this game, and I'm willing to speculate that actually presenting deals too good to be true might be beneficial in some way. Again, incentives play an important role—although it may not have been the 'best' way to play the game in a deus ex machina-sense, you could still attempt to profit the most from the type of economy that is created thusly.)

So I'm not going to comment on the game itself as I strongly suspect that I'd just make a fool of myself. Rather I'm focussing the feel of the game. I think Container represents a boundary I'm not willing to cross. Incentives are Good, but I think there's also something as too much of a Good Thing. I find games with simpler incentive management to be sufficiently challenging already; to stack three levels on top of each other makes my head hurt. In addition those other games can be appreciated to some extent by casual players too, thus ensuring that they hit the table more often. Perhaps if time and fellow players permitted I could appreciate the design more (which, I have to admit, is fairly unique), but for now I'm rather afraid I'm too much of a gaming wuss to spend much time with this title. As such I'll leave the game unrated.

Definitely want to give this another go.  First play is hard, because you aren't sure how to make anything work.  You have to remember that this is really a game based on the economy.  As long as everyone perceives the value of something to be the same as everyone else, it is true.  I still don't know how that happens in the real world, and it happens in the game as well.  An interesting economic game.  And it beats me up and makes me cry.

2008-07: After being on order with German Games for a near eternity, this game has now finally found it's way to my shelf.  One two-person attempt at a mock three-person game was interesting.  Didn't play enough to get to any auctions though and that is no doubt where this game gets really interesting.  

One and only play with real people was a five-player game where it was everyone's first play.  It was a little ugly.  The game took too long and seemed very repetitive.  Need to play again with three or four-players.

Played once with closed money and once with open money, and didn't find it especially compelling either time. (Interesting from a design standpoint, yes, but not something I want to actually sit down and play again.)

Generally, I like games where you're playing vs other players rather than the game-system, but I do prefer that there be some texture to them. (Metaphorically speaking, I prefer armed melee to unarmed combat.) Container is a bit too pure-play to sustain my interest, which means I'll likely never get good enough at it to speak its language. Pity.

RATING: 6
This game is quite brain burning. And relies a lot on player interaction. You cannot play by yourself, since the only way to get goods to your harbor, you must buy form another player's factory. To have goods on your island, you must buy from another player's harber. It's a layer of layer of layer of production and purchasing.

Unfortunately, the scoring is based on set collection. But the beauty of the components, combined with the interesting logistics, makes up for it.

Interesting no-luck (other than starting manufacturing and your victory point assignments) game where you must wash the other player's backs in order to advance. However, you also need a very clear understanding of how to value goods at different stages of the game and that's less clear. I found it kind of dry and more of an economics exercise, but then this is that kind of game.

This game is a seven layer burrito of economic goodness with ample amount of sour cream.  Don't expect theme, because it's completely abstract (which might be a deal breaker for some, but didn't bother me).  As the game progresses, there are strong "roles" that develop and in an interesting turn you develop alliances with players doing complimentary roles and competitions with players doing similar roles.

Rating may increase.

The games doesn't work as well with 3 players, sadly.

Container is a fun game where you auction what you pick up and deliver.  The part that makes it tricky is the way the set collection works, which makes it tough to block someone at the auction if it would ruin your scoring.  Each player has a preferred container type & if you buy unwisely your best containers might not score.  
I like how it tweaks with traditional mechanics to make them a little more fresh. I also like how the economy seems to scale well depending on how much or little people are willing to spend.
Solid game.  Too bad it's not available.

I love the economic dynamics here with players trying to produce the rarer goods or just generally trying to find their own place in the system.

The fact that money can only enter the system when you sell off a shipment of containers - and no way to make money without spending money - makes being forced out of the game (by virtue of having no capital to invest) a real possibility. 

At the start, I found myself struggling to do actions that would actually benefit me - having so little money that I couldn't afford to invest. Loans seem like a necessary evil and only after borrowing money was I able to 'get my machine going'.

Would love to play again. I feel it's probably all about predicting the way the market will flow and the hidden player-specific container values would hopefully keep it interesting even when all players have played tens of times.

2009-06-19 2 plays 8.5>8.7

With 3, auctions were often underpriced. Containers only really sold at minimum value but this wasn't so different to the 4-player game. Demand was lower but so was supply.

Container is a game I feel I'd like to re-play instantly after finidhing it. This time it may have been largely because we forgot about the majority container being discarded but there always seems like a chance to try new tactics and there are various ways to play.

Pure economic games don't get much better than this.  Yes, it is a game of pennies but figuring out how to make sure you have more pennies than your opponents is great fun.  I love that the economy is entirely in the hands of the players; every game feels slightly different because of it.

Valley Games, if you are listening, please work on improving your components.  The low-contrast colors and mismatch on the ships will irritate you but the game is good enough to overcome those problems.

Despite what it seems from reading about it.  Container is not a 'hard' game and would probably be a good step for new to moderately new gamers.

The first game was brain twisting as the three of us were just trying to gain our bearings.  

We all loved it and are ready to play again.

Highly recommended.

*NEW* Played a second time. Even Better.  This is the game Puerto Rico wants to be.  Other games tremble with fear when Container enters the room.  Age of Steam plays Container on its days off.

So unique with simple rules yet very deep gameplay.  Limited to only 3-5 players, but probably best with 4 or 5.  Great coopetition game (i.e. Brass) where you must rely on your opponents to be the other end of your transactions.  Supply and demand, production, setting prices, shipping goods--lots of economics and done well!
Too dry for some players, but if you enjoy economic games, then you owe yourself to at least try it.
Components are useful, yet not cheesy. Colors can be difficult to distinguish for some players, but I don't find it to be a problem personally.

Sold it away since the price was so good, despite really enjoying this game.

Excellent game. Rules are easy enough to being taught fast and get new players to play quick.

The whole time I was playing, I kept thinking "I'd rather be playing Indonesia."   It is very confusing to new playersw because of the unintuitive way in which goods reach the island. I produce goods, then someone must by them from me, then I can buy them back and ship them, then they can bid on them.  The system is incredible fragile, and that doesn't help either.  Newer players generally price things too high and stagnate the game.

Container is essentially a multi-stage economic scaffold where everything depends on the specific actions of the other players.

You really don't play the game, you play each other.

The game itself actually has somewhat minimal components, and even the rules aren't very extensive (though they are hard to get your mind around at first).

Nice.

This game has an economy that doesn't work in the way that players expect an economy game to function, which is its biggest benefit and its biggest drawback. Players would think that they would develop an economic engine to produce goods, put them in their warehouses, load them on ships, and sell them at the central island. Instead, players produce goods that may be purchased by other players, who will then place them in their own harbours. Players then attempt to entice opponents to buy goods from their harbours, while buying goods from the harbours of their opponents. Then players deliver goods to the central island, but their opponents blind bid on the goods, which will score victory points in the end-game. Players take a major cash penalty for refusing bids and buying their own goods, so it is possible, but discouraged. Compounding these elements is the fact that different colored goods are worth different values for each player. All of these mechanisms can potentially make players feel a lack of control and/or make the gameplay suffer when all players aren't playing optimally. It can instead make for an interesting and refreshing game, if players do play optimally.

I missed playing this game when it first came out.  Glad I finally got a chance to play it.  It's a fun game.  It's hard to make a buck!  A lot of it is timing and getting good deals to fall into your lap.

Also, I'm not sure how well this would play with less than 5 players.  If you are the guy with goods no one wants to buy early on, it would be tougher to get over the hump.   I don't think the beginner rule of being able to sell goods for 2 bucks every turn is right.  Too much of a cheesy way to make money.

I think this is a solid 7.

RATING: 7
Container stands as one of the purest economic games that I have played. Its self-contained market lives and dies based on player decisions, and it can be surprisingly fragile, resulting in atrocious games if individual players perform economy-destroying actions. Luckily, this is easy to avoid if the players are warned about the impact of their decisions, and an experienced player or two can guide the game back to its proper moorings. 

When experienced players comes together, Container is a thing of beauty as the players try to take advantage of the rhythm of the game, timing actions within the overall flow of the game so that they can gain the maximum advantage and thus vault above their competitors. The game's rules are deceptively simple, but the game itself is fairly opaque. Determining the right move at any particular moment in time can be difficult, and the bidding component only adds to it. Determining the best bid for a particular moment can be maddingly difficult. 

With further play, I find myself at a loss in grasping the implications of various actions and the proper play during a particular situation and thus finding myself playing it less and less. It would probably be easier to play if my opponents were enthusiastic about the game, but it really has a limited following locally. Which is a shame, because I would really like to find out what I am missing.

Some cool economic effects take place in this game, but the tiered approach of advancing containers is a little forced.   It's a lot of work getting them to the island, and after all that work it ends with an auction.   Like Modern Art, you can really mess up the economy of the game too, but once players see how that happens, it shouldn't happen often.  Some interesting ideas here, but a near miss.

I don`t know what I miss here, but I do. Maybe, in this "realistic" setting - an island to staple your containers just doesn`t satisfy me. The story arc.

Excellent pure economic game. Produce, buy, sell, and ship your goods to the remote island.

Played a 4 player game. 3 players went bankrupt. Would need to play again. Game is interesting.

Economic wise can be very difficult. If player buys own container instead of selling to another player, no new money is entered in the game in question. Reason why in our game 3 players went bankrupt.

Another game played of Container will make me have a better feel of the game and understanding.

fragile and opaque economic game. It's a game that I should love, but the down time bothered me
when the economic engine seems so chaotic. there really isn't a way to guarantee the earned income
needed to sustain quality play. plus less then 5 players may unbalance the resource tree since demand
for 1 or two goods may be minimal? Also, it seems that players need to balance their purchasing decisions
to keep a leader from running away, which sort of leads to a kingmaking potential.... Just did not 
enjoy this so far. rating could go up with additional plays. willing to give it more plays, but only with five.

I'm going to have to start this one off a little lower.  First game felt really too unforgiving.  We all made the wrong choices and ground the economy to a halt.  Even if that is realistic, which I'm not convinced it is, there should be more than just a casual warning in the rule strategy section about this.  Maybe even a variant, out of the box, to prevent it for players that don't enjoy such a tight game.

However, looking forward to another game to see if learning from our mistakes will turn things around enough to give it a better rating.

Fun, interesting economics game. I really enjoy the open-ended play this game entails. Sure, your true options are fairly set - what you can and cannot do is well defined and the overall strategy is pretty basic. But, what makes Container shine IMO is the details of your decisions. How you price, where you decide to buy and in what combination, when you ship, and capital management are what make Container an excellent, excellent economics game.

Simple but brilliant game. A very dynamic game with very subtle strategies. There's no one fixed way of doing things and how to win the game depends greatly on reading your opponents' strategies and finding a way to exploit the situation. It does mean that the quality of play is dependent on players being able to avoid groupthink. If one bugger starts building factories and everyone joins him ... well, that's a recipe for disaster.

[1 play] My one experience with this game was not a success. But I'm willing to grant that the game probably has merits I have yet to perceive. If circumstances compel me to play it again, I'll try to give it another chance.  But until then, I'll be devoting my leisure time to games that were actually fun the first time.

In the early game, nobody would buy my stuff.  I dropped the prices to fire-sale levels, and still nobody would buy my stuff.  I'd spent all my money and so couldn't do anything, and felt like I was just shut out of the game. Later on, people started to do business with me, but I ended up being perpetually out of step with the rest of the economy.  On turns when I had lots of money, nothing that I wanted was up for auction, and because I had to do something on my turn, I ended up wasting my money on stuff I didn't care about. Then on the alternate turns when I had little money, the goods I really desperately wanted would be put up for auction, and I wouldn't be able to afford them.

Interesting game with some tough decisions, only played it 3p so far and it doesnt work as well as I would like it to. The problem is that if players decide to cut you out of the game its easy enough to do, its like the whole game is an exercise in king making. You can have the cheapest containers to sell and make all the right moves but ultimately lose simply because other players stitched up the game. More players would make this more difficult but not impossible.

Only works if all players know what they are doing. Winning strategy strongly depends on other players actions. The theme goes well with the game mechanics. Playing pieces are functional and the number placement on the player's "harbor boards" indicate who can take which action. Out of the box the colors on the pieces are a poor choice (e.g. green/white, orange/brown look similar).Actions available are very straightforward but keeping net worth and goal in mind can be tricky at times. Overall, solid well balanced strategy game that is not forgiving.

Nope, just didn't work for me. Too opaque at first, and since I don't like blind-bidding, I wasn't motivated to put in the investment plays for the light to go on. I sold for a quite reasonable price despite its rarity. Probably should've held out for more. See, this game just baffles me.

Okay, I gave this a chance, and I really enjoyed it!  There's zero luck in the game, and it's a fascinating simulation of a supply-and-demand economy.  Our first game got off to a pretty quick start, but it lost some tempo about 90 minutes into the game and dragged on a bit.  The problem is that the main producer guy raised his prices as soon as one of the colors ran out, so the boat loads got smaller and we all started jockeying for the endgame.  In the end it was three hours long, and everybody agreed it was a little too long but still had fun.

Played this again a few years later and it didn't seem to bog down as much.  Would definitely play again.

Nice bits, but very dry economic game. I came a poor third, and I have a major gripe. I'll concede that I could have done better if I'd taken loans early in the game, but to me a game with a loan mechanism is a warning to over-spending. In this game, it is a requirement to keep cash fluidity. Certainly a reflection of modern economics, and look where that's got us.

No, my mojor gripe was that as the 4th player, I got screwed. The game basically has three cycles, Production brings in containers, Buying puts them into a dockside, Selling/deliver turns them into cash and VPs. As the 4th player, the most favourable choice of these three was always taken by a player before me. If player 1 produced and set a low price, player 2 or 3 would take them to their docks. If player 2 set a low selling price, player 3 would by them before me. Whatever happened, wherever there was a good deal, I missed out. I could have won more auctions if I had taken a loan. I missed out on several auctions by 1 penny. But even so, the 3 stage flow of the game meant that when it got to my 4th turn, all the good stuff was gone.

So it wasn't a good experience for me. 

However, I just don't think it's much of game. It's not much fun. The whole thing is more of a sim than anything. You cannot vary a previous price unless you spend that action. If I'd played this in playtesting, I'd have been moaning a lot. It's not boring, it's just not fun. Dry economics.

I'll probably still buy a copy though.

Container is a pure economic game subject to the will of the players. Not surprisingly, players cannot succeed alone and timing is essential to success. Like many economic games, the key seems to be to do whatever the other players aren't.

A strange brew of a game.  The control over your own destiny is very subtile; it hinges on the cooperation of the other players which can just as easily avoid your offers and go somewhere else.

A very flexible, true economic game about the value chain; supposedly it's about managing player incentives, and tends to be more tactical than strategic, but that's beyond me for now.

Good production values but the colours are ridiculously similar. I really like the player-driven economy and emphasis on cooperation and niche-finding.

The rules are very simple, but there's a lot going on - needs more plays.

The market is real, the prices are real, and the competition is real.

This is a very interesting Euro game. It's a bit more complex than most, and I'm intrigued by it. Thematically, I think it's a bit mismatched. You play as the supplier, as wholesaler, as the retailer and as the end customer. The interaction of those parts is a bit quirky and hard to figure out. The victory conditions are brilliantly done, I like auctions as an element of games, and I find this to be very unique. I expect its low rating here on BGG has to do with its complexity, and the fact that a lot of the gameplay is counter-intuitive. I'd love to have a crack at playing it four times in a few days or something, to see if I can get to know it a bit better.

RATING: 9
What a great game.  Very subtle.  Definitely benefits from experienced players.  Finding your niche in the economy can be very difficult and is very enjoyable.  I have only once experienced anything close to a recession in this game and that was when everyone went way too crazy investing in infrastructure early on and no one had any money to spend on auctions at the island, but it wasn't that big of a deal, the first couple shipments we just sucked it up and lost a few bucks on the shipment in order to jumpstart the economy.  Now the game is becoming very rewarding.  Games often deviate from the standard $2 factory and $3-4 dock containers as everyone better learns to manipulate the market.  

The biggest variation is in the silent auction.  There can be some luck.  A game can be won or lost there, but prices rather quickly become quite reliable as people learn the value of each spent action.  And if you properly manipulate shipments going to the island, you can tip the scales in your favor to win those auctions, or get paid a lot.  Despite being very subtle, the player interactions and evolution of the economy are just so interesting once you become familiar with the game.

Very uncertain about this one; far too much number-crunching is required and with the maximum number of players this lengthens the game greatly.  With two actions per player this game should be racing, but instead there is a period of AP akin to each player doing a crossword puzzle on their turn.

It has potential, I'm just not sure it will go the distance with our group; which is probably going to mean it will take some time before I can try it again.  And I really need to try it again.

After what I had read about Container before my first play I expected a deep and rather complex game. Surprisingly, it is neither. I don't even think it is purely a gamers' game. While I guess the economy is a little fragile and can be run into the ground if people play "strangely", the rules are so simple and mostly intuitive that it should be suitable for non-gamers as well, provided they have an interest in the economic theme.

Now, even though I wouldn't call Container a particularly deep game there are heaps of important decisions to be made. As the entire economy is run by the players, pretty much every single action counts. Does that sound contradictory to you? Isn't that awesome?

Container has a notoriously fragile in-game economy, but honestly that fact is a draw rather than a repulsion for me. The few times that I was fortunate enough to play we didn't run into trouble, but I could sense the path to trouble was nearby. Regardless, the games went smoothly and were amazing experiences. I hear that a reprint of Container is in the works. This is great news as it currently commands massive prices on the secondary market.

Too long and repetitive for the type of game it is. A bit like modern art but made longer. 
Actions are not my favourite mechanism and hidden auctions is a big part of this game. 
I have only played one game and won but without feeling that I did anything interesting or funny. I just bought containers and shiped going back and forth making more money then my opponents. 
Feals like an old outdated game. 

Cool with boats and setting prices can be a bit fun. If played with the right group so that it is really quick I might play it again.

RATING: 2
The economic engine in this game feels forced.  The inability to corner markets sets up a system where there really is no supply and demand.  A few gamey rules create a small sense of this (most containers eliminated, and the 5/10 container)  but the reality is all "real" actions occur on the main island, making the production and port profits negligible.  Pricing slightly high, and without being able to monopolize, means you will always be undersold and ultimately boycotted.  If this happens your ability to make decisions reduces to naught except for wasting actions to reduce costs.  If your warehouses are filled and no one is buying you are seemingly again reduced in your decision process.  There should be ways to actually control the economy more effectively either by forcing a monopoly on goods, or by being able to junk goods if not purchased (possibly selling to bank for minimal gains/losses).  I don't care for the blind values, as this also seems gamey.  In an economic engine wouldn't it make sense that all things would value depending on scarcity. I tend to think that in an economic model there are better ways to generate a truer sense of market values without such obvious gamey mechanics and create values for yourselves. I feel if instead of the most container rule and blind values, something along the lines of differentiating values of containers at end game depending on the amount sold would create a more dynamic market.  For example if at the game end 15 white, 13 tan, 11 black, 9 orange, and 9 brown were resting on the island collectively (total of all players' containers) then the container with the highest number is worth the least and so on. In this case say white is worth 2, tan 4 black 6, and since two are tied both are worth 9 (instead of a full ten). I think something like this would still instigate players to balance their collections but would also lend itself to more thoughtful decisions on container purchases.  I never felt that production had the ability to come to a halt (preventing any tension or goods scarcity) unless people decided they were going to price things above the minimum cost causing people to not buy and forcing the factories to fill up (may sound good in theory but in play it causes the game to shut down for rounds).  This however goes back to the point made before, that as soon as you go anywhere beyond the first two pricing points someone will undercut you, and make the production boards useless. The game also can lend itself to collusion and ultimately force players to their knees (and not in that good screwage/conflict way).  As so much is dependent on players turning the wheels together in synchronicity, any step away from this causes major king making, player bashing, or even worse game lock up scenarios.  Being a perceived leader is doomsday here.  All in all this game just felt incomplete.  It is suggested you need competent players who can value properly, but I feel that any defense of a game by suggesting people play wrong is flawed, unless they just are literally playing the game wrong (as per rules).  A game should not be this fragile, nor should it be so scripted that any deviation in play and strategy can grind the design to a halt. I have more issues but will let them rest for now.

After 2 plays I can see that this is the kind of game I will like.  In many ways, it is an improved version of "Modern Art" in that it creates a much more opaque market that is more difficult (but not impossible) to value - with actual and perceived values varying more significantly among the players.  Simple rules, low fiddliness factor and enough goin on to make it interesting for multiple plays as you learn to wrap your head around the market makes it a winner.   Replayabiilty seems like it will be high.  I wish it were available for play on BSW, it would be perfect for that medium.

Fun mechanics. I like how you dock your ship on the island, or another player's bay, or out at sea. Feels like a lot of strategy is in it. A bit mathy. Two problems:

1. The colors suck. Too many similar colors.
2. You can get into a "death spiral" of debt if you're not careful. I did. I had two loans and no money at one point. I couldn't even service my loans, so I kept losing containers from my part of the island. There was literally nothing I could do.

At first the economics in this game is mind-twisting. After a short while you get what it's all about and then it starts! Container is a really unique economic game where you HAVE TO interact with others because there's no other way to earn money.

Bought in November 2014.

Everything I've read about [thing=26990][/thing] seemed confirmed by my first plays (5p & 3p). It's an unforgiving economic game, relatively simple rules with fascinating emergent complexity. Awful graphic design, arguably dry theme, but I certainly want to play again.

Update: This has become one of my favourites. I've made a custom set out of Lego. With little pirate minifigs and everything.

Play with expansion rules: Remove one container per player from each colour, allow players to build multiple factories of the same colour, allow loans between players (if a player wants to take a loan and another player is willing to offer it, he must take it or nothing. Another player may offer a higher loan for the same $1/turn interest payment).

RATING: 5.5
An economic and auction game based on producing and shipping 5 goods distinguishable only by color and each player's unique secret scoring rubric for the different colors. Elegant base mechanics. Unfortunately, the end result is determined more by the trailing players' failures than the leading players' successes. The key to victory in all my sessions has been "hope the other players overbid for your ships full of goods".

This may be fixable with variants (adjusting the bonus paid for accepting a winning auction bid), but I lack the inclination to playtest them since this doesn't seem to me like it would be a truly great game if fixed.

A near miss. We are fans of punishing business games but the cash felt too tight in this one (in our second game we had all three players go bust -- maxed out on loans and with no money in the market, the game just spiraled into shedding containers for everyone, with no way to get out of the hole). For our third game we played the "beginner's" version, which put more cash into the game and loosened things up considerably, but by the end none of us were especially eager to play again. I didn't feel that the game had a beginning, middle, or end ... at the beginning I was buying cheap crap and selling it for a slight profit, and on the last turn I was doing the very same thing. I wanted to feel like I was building a shipping empire, but instead we were just kind of passing money around in a circle. It is not a bad game, but I think it is subject to going off the rails if you don't play it a "right" way, and while groupthink isn't always a bad thing in an economic game, in this case I think it leads to the illusion of multiple paths when in fact the path to survival (let alone victory) is fairly scripted. Perhaps its greatest sin is that it just isn't as good as Age of Steam, Power Grid, Acquire, or Brass, which means Container is buried pretty deep on the bench and it will be a long time (if ever) before it gets another turn at bat.

Played 3+ times. This game is prone to group think destroying the fun. It is possible for an individual to get in a spiral of debt and it is possible for a whole group to starve the game of money. Provided there are a few early small shipments then the game should take off fine. I am sure the designer conceived that goods would sell in the mid price range but it is hard for containers to get sold or brought for anything but the lowest costs because someone is bound to undercut and the only way to prevent having to waste an action re-pricing goods is to knock out stuff at the lowest possible price in the first place. I am sure I still have a lot to learn about Container, it certainly fascinates me. I am rating it generously because it is a style of game I enjoy though its fragile nature makes it a poor choice for folk who are not willing to commit to playing it as a group on a number of occasions. *UPDATE* The night after a game of Container I lie in bed thinking about it. This is a good thing. I want to checkout other games by the same designer. I like the way his mind works. Oct 08

A good game of buying and selling and money optimization. The game itself is pretty simple, but the interactions and dependencies are quite obscure. It is difficult to see what is the best short term play to get maximum long term benefits.

In some ways, it reminded me of a more complex version of Modern Art. You can make money both by buying paintings that go up in value, or selling paintings to others. The same choice underlies much of the play in this game.

It's a good game, but not one that I find myself wanting to play again anytime soon. 

6/4/15 UPDATE: Well, I was true to my word-- second play comes five years later. However, I'll admit I liked it better this time, even though I did much worse. I still see the Modern Art comparison, but now I see how having the added layers (produce, buy, sell, ship, store) makes a richer, more complex relationship. A solid game.

The fact that you can't buy your own produced goods or own goods that are on the docks is a little counter-intuitive but once you get your head round that and, therefore, what goods you need to produce etc it is an intriguing game. The fact that everyone scores differently for the colours is a vital part of the game as it keeps everyone guessing as to who actually wants what and what they will value things at.

Manipulating the game in your favor requires creative thinking and long term planning, but players must be willing to be opportunistic when the situation arises, keeping a nice blend of tactics and strategy.

Knowing how the game can break down can be a useful tool to manipulate the game in your favor.  Work on creating an imbalance in liquidity between players and time the ending when the ebb and flow will favor you.  Use opportunistic predatory pricing to gain temporary leverage in grabbing a few extra containers while sinking some money from the economy.  The game isn't won or lost by one clever move, but through a series of inches.

I'm still toying with how to best use loans.

Played at concentric '12. Players must not over invest in infrastructure or buy their own shipments otherwise money is sucked out of the economy and the game will stall. Only use debt if you have a plan to pay it back in a turn or two - it is expensive at 10pc per turn. Feels a lot like modern art which I like.

Nothing too wrong with the gameplay, maybe just not fun for me. Besides, it places a solid economic system in the hands of the players, and then adds unnecessary randomness with blind bidding. Two serious production issues: fragile ships in the wrong colors and containers in similar colors.

RATING: N/A
straight-forward, but multi-staged buying and selling game. produce goods that you sell in your production area, buy goods from others production areas that go in your port.  sell goods in your port that go on others ships.  buys goods from other ports and put on your ship.  sell goods on your ship to island in blind auction.  buy goods you want from other ships on island in said blind auctions.  only a few actions to choose from.  each action must be such that you profit a bit each step of the way.  There is some memory element if you want to keep track of what everyone seems to value most.

gets a little same-ey after a while.  may want to use fewer containers to help the game go along.  there are some timing issues to consider that adds some interest to the game for me.  also looks as though there are strategies as producers, middle-men and auctioneer.  though in my one game the big pay-offs were n the auctions as people bid up to get the goods.  actually don't mind the blind bidding in this one.  I think it's the best way to do the auctions in this case.

This game makes me hate life every time I play (and not in a fun way like Chicago Express) but somehow I keep crawling back to it like an abused spouse. I like low-luck economics games, so it seems like Container should be right up my alley. But when it comes to playing I just have no idea what to do and I have some kind of mind cloud that keeps me from understanding how the game at large functions. So it turns into two hours of arbitrary tedium that wouldn't be fun even if I won (which I never do). 

Until I have a breakthrough and promote it, or dismiss it and demote it, Container will languish at a 5, wandering between two worlds, one dead, the other powerless to be born.

Bought this as part of a three game "late" Christmas gift for myself (with Zombies!!! 8 and Carcassonne The Wheel of Fortune). Looks like it will be a good game, but the boats are made of some very strange feeling plastic. They feel like they could easily snap into two if too much pressure is applied. Also the colours of the boats are quite far off from what is described in the rules. Speaking of rules, thank goodness the rules are printed in 6 languages. At first I thought that book was English only! Whew!

i've played this game many times, and as others have commented here it is definitely a game that requires folks that interact to create business and grow the economy.  that is precisely what makes this game different than any other it punishes folks who dont like to trade, sell, buy, from their competitors.  As someone else pointed out every player is dependent on the rest of the players, just like a real economy is. 

I have the expansion pack which includes player loans (players can lend to other players instead of using the bank), and I have to say this single feature gives this game a dimension unlike any other.  It is open ended and up to each individual and as a collective to generate economy and try to pull ahead.  

I highly recommend this game as a basic economics course and woudl encourage people to discuss the economic reasons behind their moves following the game.  It is incredible how this game is a microcosm of real world economic activity.  Enjoy!!  :)

A true economic game. Players must successfully buy and sell on different levels (factory/harbor/auction). That's it!! It can be hard to pay more for a resource than you think it's worth until you realize that unless you pump $$$ into Container's economy, it won't come back to you when you want it to.

Every game seems very different, the economics depend very much on the mindsets of the players. Turn order seems to be able to screw people over, but that might just be me not adjusting my strategy properly.

Played a few more times now, and requires a very focussed group of players. Playing with a few casual gamers led to a very difficult game, economy getting very dry very quickly and relying on those more involved in the game to keep it moving at all. Still find the movements of money and conterintuitiveness fascinating though, so will gladly play any time.

The colours aren't great as well

A very interesting build, buy, ship, auction game. Be very careful of cash flow if you are not using the selling to local market rule. Our first game was marred by one player getting into so much debt he couldn't do anything other than barely service hte debt on charity from other players. The local market rule is labeled as a beginner rule but I would play it the first time any new player is in the game.

RATING: 7
After my first play, I liked the game, and I think I have a better idea of how it works.  Need more plays to decide if it's great or an analysis-paralysis slugfest.

With low randomness but lots of pricing and auctions, the game clearly depends a lot on who you're playing with.  If people are stingy, then margins will be slim, and money can be very tight.  But if people pay lots for early shipments to the island, then the bank payouts add lots of money to the game, which can be very inflationary.

It's somewhat important to guess what other players are going for, but only to gauge the customer demand so that you can price goods accordingly.  (With less players, this might be more important, because you don't want to create a shipment of goods that nobody wants... including you!) 

The timing of the end game is tricky -- it's a bit of a press-your-luck situation like Ticket To Ride or Power Grid, but not too bad.  It just means that the dynamic is very different from Goa, where the game end is known well in advance.

Rules notes: they're not well laid out.  The Geek has great player aids that make the rules clearer, but the rules about loans are still not clear to me.  For example, I know that I can take a loan at any time, but if I do it to have enough money for an action (e.g. $1 to produce goods from my factories), can I then ship goods to the island for my second action and pay the $10 back from the proceeds of the auction without ever having paid interest?

I really wanted to like this game. It's an economic game, and I'm a big fan there. However, this game functions in no wise like an actual economy. You make goods that you can't utilize. You have to provide incentives to people but you have no definite feedback as to whether or not those incentives are relevant (i.e. you have no idea whether the containers you're providing to the market are the ones your opponents want). Additionally, it's tough to put a price on the goods that you're bidding on once a delivery shows up at the island. Increasing the value of the containers is a key to victory, but it's very hard to keep track of what those goods may have cost to produce or even what they'll be worth to you at the end of the game. In general there is a lack of information that, despite the innovative mechanics, makes this game very unappealing to me.

An interesting approach to a semi-closed economic game.  You have no direct control over anything other then the price you set for your goods, and what you need to do is entice the other players to pickup and deliver the goods you need on the center island.  Hopefully you will have the cash necessary to bid for their delivery.The components are generally nice, and I especially like the size of the ships.  The color of the ships are so so at best (they can be painted over), and the game cannot be played by color blind people (some colors are difficult to differentiate for those of us who are NOT color blind!)With only two actions to perform when it is your turn to play, downtime appears to be minimal.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Container is a totally neat game of economic player interdependence. Because money entering or leaving the economy is a player-driven choice, players are literally tethered together and are collectively responsible for the health and well-being of the shared economy (as to not bring the game to a grinding halt, although I hear that that's a great strategy for tanking players who have invested too heavily in infrastructure and have no liquid(-able) assets; but also a good strategy to never have new players play it with you ever again!). The game then becomes almost literally one of game theory as presented within economics: it is not only a game of emergent and ever-shifting valuation, but also one of playing the prisoner's dilemna (i.e., how much of a micro-advantage can you squeeze out of a relationship before your pair decides that it is worth more to them to make the wholly selfish and self-serving decision). 

Because this game is primarily and almost strictly an economic one, I wish that there were a bit more space for (like in real life) the intangibles that exceed economics (but I also understand that it might also be against the spirit and intentionality of the game). As such, I'm still not sure if it's a game that would go up or down for me with more plays as I personally prefer more volatility in games I play (over micro-accrual of advantages).

Yeah, so thematically it's hard to justify 1 person producing containers, another storing them, another shipping them, then auctioning to everyone.  I got over it and recognized this game as subtly trying to get things to go your way amid a little chaos.  Won't seek it out often but I enjoy it a little more each time.

RATING: 8
[Initial Impression: 8] Possibly one of the best economic engines around - values shift as the game evolves, and the players have quite a lot of control over the markets. It is important to know when players are over-paying for auction lots and to take advantage of that situation by concentrating on shipping to the island rather than on buying lots yourself. I worry a bit about the possibility of "degenerate" strategies, but will need more plays to determine the game system's robustness against these. Can run long, but it seems one could easily use fewer containers (try the 4-player rule with 5) to shorten the game.

RATING: 8
Good economic shipping game. Players can set their own prices rather than the game deciding... in the games I have played one player set the prices so low he kept the in-game money tight, in another game 3 players forced the prices high. Game can take nearly 3 hours to play with an active group, lots of discussions and banter. The only disappointment is the quality of components, the ship colours are incorrect and materials used are not good enough for a game that costs so much to purchase.

This is not the best designed game in the world. The rules are not well written (The Loan section was a pain in the ***. I spent 15 minutes trying to figure it out   and only after that did I find out that there was an official errata that completely rewrote the rules of that section...), and the economic model it simulates is kinda artificial and fragile. 

Having said that, I still give it a 9 because of the mechanic. This is a slightly flawed, but incredibly deep, innovative and fun game. It feels like a breath of fresh air, and I'm sure it will hit the table over and over again.

After a few more plays of Container with other people in both 3 and 4 player games, I find it to be more interesting than I did months ago when I played it one time with 3 players.  The volatility of the economy is really interesting, in that one person throwing a wrench in the system can bring the money flow to its knees.

This can be a blessing and a curse.  On one hand, the push and pull of the money and containers is engaging and interesting when everyone is playing to win.  On the other, if one person 'gives up', or doesn't take out a loan and quits contributing to the economy, things get lopsided and slow.

I also like the hidden island scoring.  All of the factors that go into which containers you're willing to buy at what prices, who you think will buy them at what prices, how badly you need them and the value per container - this can give some good brain burning that you feel good about when done right.  Or as done in our four player game, pretty much ignore the island and just produce and ship crazily to get a huge pile of cash!

I really like the way everything interacts and different ways you can win but it's still a little too dry for a 10, and not a game I think I'll get to the table too often.  Still one of my favorites.

No comment on initial play.

Update (10/01/11): I played this once three years ago, and shudder when I think of it today. It is one of those "produce some resources, convert them into some other resources, store the resources, and then ship the resources" kind of game. I never figured out the sequence of how this was to occur, as it was convoluted. Seemed like it was quite popular at the time, peaked, and then faded away. I don't care to play this one again.

Update (02/10/13): Let's be brutally honest: I don't care to ever play this again. Down to a '2'.

Loved the game play. I love the unforgiving economy in this game. However, I can not give it a 9 because of the poor color scheme in the game. It would have been much better to adopt the colors Mike Doyle used on the cover. The colors of ships and machines/containers is simply confusing. It's a great cover by the way.

Played again at a SoCal Games Day with 4 players and must admit ended up being bored. Two players chose to bid nothing on some early ships and therefore all the containers were going to one player. it was ludicrous. Then, the player in the lead decided to refuse a 9 dollar bid and pay for it himself. He nearly busted the economy doing it, made himself the winner, and no one else was getting containers.....it was very unsatisfying. I am beginning to get concerned that this game can be too easily Broken with less than 5 players.

Not only is this the best economic game I've ever played; it is in fact arguably the only really economic game I've ever played; while other games with that label are really "build a money-making machine," this game captures the positive sum nature of actual markets: Every transaction is a question of "how do I make this valuable enough to the other guy that he takes it, while ensuring it's even more valuable to me?"

I dislike blind bidding.  I often pay 100% over the next player's bid, and it makes me feel foolish.

This game is alright, but it suffers from the fact that players have total control over their economy.  That seems like it would be a good thing, but new players are dumb struck by how to make good choices with the 4 options they have, and the game can be a little long.

I wanted to play Container at the last Wellycon. None of us had many clues how to play, I was too greedy when setting prices and was least afraid of taking out loans. Rob was good at buying cheap and selling cheap. I did a lot of early shipping. But ultimately Andrew won.

RATING: 8
An interesting free market game with no artificial restrictions on pricing, one that plays well, sets itself up for a grandstand finish and then (certainly in the beginners' game, but the advanced game is also vulnerable) goes on half an hour too long. I suggest removing 2-3 containers of each colour to avoid overstayed welcome. Suffers doubly (literally in view of the 'government subsidy' that doubles winning bids) from the 'Modern Art' effect where excited over-bidders skew the game in favour of those selling the most.

There is a lot going on here.  Superficially: the color scheme is terrible and this does make a difference to game play, the boats are unpleasant to the touch, it is difficult to remember what the scorecards say and some physical reminder of the subsidies is lacking.  Gameplay wise: Selling is clearly superior to producing. Knowing what to bid is incredibly difficult; my experience was rather like Goa, in that even if I make what seems to be a very high bid, everyone else will double it. There was a lot of stalling toward the middle and end of the game.  It seems that buying machines and warehouses does not really pay off. 

I do not understand the game and am not qualified to rate it.

Good gravy do I ever lover Container. It's not really a game, it's a social experement, as different groups lead to completely different experiances. You and your fellow gamers are the entirety of an economy, from production to distribution, and you are allowed to price your stuff however you wish (well, almost). Leads to quite a dynamic process, and a lot of thinking about how to improve your financial situation, based on the styles of your fellow business owners. The entertainment level drops when you're not doing so well (like never being able to ship anything because everyone got there first), but it's still an enjoyable time. Plus it's fun to play with the little boats.

First played March 18th, 2009. Taught in ~15min, played in a little over 2hrs for 5 players. This game has a good balance of luck and strategy. I was surprised at how much depth it has for such a simple concept. I'd recommend giving this a game play and consideration in purchase if you can manage to find 2 hours to play the game. Each player starts with $20, a factory of a different type of good, a good from your factory, a warehouse, a player area, a ship, and a goal card. Each players goal card is different and has the 5 types of goods listed. One good is worth 10VPs, 5/10VPs, 6VPs, 4VPs, 2VP. There is a common island where players sell their goods for VPs. On your turn you can, buy a factory($6,9,12; must be for a different good; store 2 more goods), warehouse($4,5,6,7; lets you store one more good), produce 1 good for each factory you have($1 to player on the right; may pick which good type if you have limited storage; set price of goods; reorganize goods), buy goods from another player at their set factory set price(limit to your storage area; place in your storage area/shipyard; set price; reorganize goods), move ship(to another player(can't be yourself) area(free action to buy goods;max 5 on ship), to sea, or island(all other players secret bid $ (to you) on your goods for VPs(for them));if a tie, tied players bid additional $ blind; seller can accept high bid and gets same $ from the bank or pay $ himself) Each player takes two actions and a player may do any action twice except produce. You may also take a loan out or $10. You pay interest of $1 at the begining of each of your turns and then can pay back the loan. The end of the game occurs on the turn of the player that causes two of the goods to run out. At the end of the game, you lose all of the good that you have the most. If there is a tie, you lose the 10/5VP good. If you have at least one of each good, you get 10VP for the 10/5VP good. Then you cash in your money and add up your total $ or VPs. Each good you have in your warehouse is worth $2. Each good you have on your ship is worth $3. Loans -$11.

First off . . . the boats are incredibly cool boardgaming bling.

Now that we have that out of the way . . . I liked the game.

The game rules regarding exchange of goods and money from production to market to shipping to delivery - where they are then auctioned - was quite convoluted, which made the game a bit counter-intuitive to initially pick up.  [i.e., I do not envy anyone who is teaching the game.]  After a test play, I did start to get the hang of the mechanic and generated some ideas about strategy.

I would give this another play.  The "7" rating is fairly tentative, as I could see this being an 8 or a 6 with more exposure.

Did I mention how cool the boats were?

Finally got a chance to play this.  I'd actually designed a couple similar games, but decided they just were too dry and not enough fun.  Container does better what I intended, but that doesn't make it good.  The margins are so thin that almost all the money comes in from the auctions at the island.  It makes the rest of the game seem meaningless.

Still though, it is a fascinating economic system.

I was shocked that a game so dry and unintuitive would be so enjoyable to play.  Each little decision you make affects the tiny economy you and the other players are creating, so it feels like the players are completely in control of the game.  Being in control and knowing the best move are two different things, of course.

First play with 4. Container is a mid-weight game with almost no luck factor. The game mechanics do not entirely complement the theme, but at least the latter is original in the boardgaming world. My first impression was positive, but I believe this game will need another couple of plays to judge properly.

I wasn't expecting too much, but was pleasantly surprised.  Pickup and delivery games tend to be dry and mechanical.  Mercifully, that's not true with Cargo.  Enough of the information is hidden to make the game more of a psychological guessing game than a mathematical exercise.  There are a couple of things that hold back a stronger enthusiasm for the game.  First, its a touch long and I can easily imagine it dragging.  Secondly, there are some real functionality questions here -- three shades of brown???  What's wrong with grey???  Finally, the economics feel a little bit off.  It seems very hard to increase the value of containers.  Yes, there is an element of group think here, but its perhaps to easy and too tempting to undercut your opponents.  If the supply of goods was as interesting as the auctioning, it would add another layer of depth.  

That said, there do seem to be variable paths to victory.  So, the game warrants some exploration.

It's quite OK, but the total freedom of choice (I mean price setting) is so diffcult to handle correctly that it puts me off.  On the other hand maybe this whole price setting doesn't matter at all or matters only to a minimum degree.  That would be even more troubling... :>

All in all, very intriguing game. I personally like very much the idea for scoring (collecting different types of containers with additional conditions put on it), but great half of the game with another half being unfilfilling is just too little for me to buy this.

initial rating one play 4 players

Really a shame our friend left us so early, every game I have played and own of his are entirely original and unique and this one is no exception.

Maybe a bit too long for what it is which is easily tweaked, it does seem five might be best for the balance of the goods but it still played very well with 4. There were some stagnant times in the game where it seemed not much could be done but this could have been the way this particular game played out. 

Blind bidding for the auctions worked fine although alternatives can be considered, ties being broken by the seller I'm not sure about, shouldn't happen too often anyway. The variant of selling back a container for 2 can be exploited and needs to be watched for if used, by game end this is a lot of money. 

Multiple paths a strength here but it does seem to have slight issues. Pricing things above the cheapest amount didn't seem to work, people would just shop elsewhere, more plays needed to determine how viable this really is. Getting deep in debt also seems pretty easy which would stall your whole game, again more play needed to see if the system has the fault here. Colour of the ships was 'off' but even more concerning was how fragile they appeared, I could see them easily snapping in half if mishandled. 

Note that I think this system might just be very group sensitve on how good it will 'work' (and maybe we botched it) but overall it does not seem to come out as polished as his other titles, possibly brought to market too soon?. Seems just a tad underdeveloped which makes me wonder if he himself actually finished it...

Container (and Chicago Express) exemplify the "few rules, many decisions" style of game. My one complaint is that players consistently overbidding at auction (by which I mean: bidding close to or more than the value to them of a lot, just so that they'll have containers on the island) tends to skew the profits hugely towards shipping, which is less interesting.

A game I have had since first release and finally got to play a 4 player game today.

Owned and traded away.  It's a fine game, but several people in this area own it and my regular group of train / econ gamers rarely asked to have it hit the table.  No one disliked it, but there wasn't a "Holy shit that's awesome" reaction to it either.

I would not mind playing it again several more times, especially if it was with experienced players or at least only with newbies for the first game.

Lots of player interaction and negotiation; I like games where you play against the players and not the game, and Container delivers (haha). While it doesn't have dudes on a map to push around like Imperial, there seems to be less AP (so far) and you get to make crane and ship noises while you move cargo around with the ships.

There's a lot to like in the game, and it is the sort of game I feel I ought to like. That being said, the blind bidding for shipments, as well as the non-transparent value of containers to players are both mechanisms I hate with a vengeance. With those two aspects of the game "fixed" (that is, to my liking), my rating would improve considerably.

RATING: 10
After one play with three...

Reading the rules gave me a sense of intrigue, hope, and fear.  Fear that this game would not live up to my expectations. Hope that it could exceed them, and intrigue as far as what exactly would transpire.

First, the ruleset is actually quite simple.  It was very each to teach - I had read through the rules once before the game, taught the "outline" version of the rules to the other players, and referred to the book perhaps three times to confirm what we had already figured out.  Not bad.

The game started awkwardly, as we didn't know what to look/plan for, or how to react to other peoples' actions, but this changed slowly through the game as we started figuring out where there was money to be made.  As the light bulbs turned on, the game went from being an exploration of a strange, abstract, opaque game, to understanding enough of how the pieces fit together to push our agendas, even if still a bit randomly.

The end result was a thinky, convoluted, but not overwhelming game that plays lighter than it is, results in more fun banter than far more colorful games, and looks like it should be quite replayable.


Two plays...

This game could be a 9, which, for me, is as good as it gets.  I'll give it a few more plays before I go there.  I came in dead last in the second game because I pushed my "10" containers to being the most common right before the end of the game.

I am starting to see how to subtly control the market, at least in theory... other players have to take your bait!  I am awful at bidding on containers.  I always seem to bid 1-2 less than the winner if I really want something.

Initial Rating: 7.5 (August 2011)

I like the fact that the game has a very low luck factor, and that it has simple teachable rules. The theme is very dry for my taste but I like the game. 

The game mechanics are easy to grasp and prevents (for the most part) AP. I like, most of all, the hidden auction mechanic and the fact that you play with hidden money, it makes you pay attention to what other players are doing and lessen the effect of downtime.

It seems container is a subtle game, it has a very refined supply and demand system but sometimes I feel I´m not playing a game at all, I feel like I´m learning economic lessons :D.

Bottom line Container is a fine game, one I want to explore further, besides it is one of the few games my GF rated very high.

RATING: 7
Has some neat mechanics, but if I want to think this much I'd rather play Indonesia.  Blind bidding for shipments is a real negative.

Update 11/2009:  Having played a 5p game in addition to my original 3p game, I see I had underrated Container.  It probably won't be one of my absolute favorites - I tend not to appreciate as much games where valuations of items are determined so strongly by the players.  (See Modern Art.)  I prefer some anchor given to me by the game - for example, rubber shipping for 30.  Container is a little too much like a real economy for my taste.

Having said that there is no denying this is a good game, one I'll need to play at least a couple more times.

This games is much heavier than I had expected.  You must manage your production to match what people what to buy, and what you buy from other players to put in your Harbor Store has to match what people want to put on their ships.

RATING: 7.5
Yet another economic engine game; but this has some nice twists. It feels a bit eccentric, but it all works. A lot of emergent complexity from some surprisingly simple rules. (Like Chicago Express in that way.) The relative value of each color is determined by a secret card given at the beginning of the game, so it's a bit like Clans trying to figure out the other players' motives. Money goes out of the game with purchase of production/warehouse and comes in from bank only when a person wins an auction--that's weird. God-awful pastel colors and board--one of the ugliest boards ever--but game good enough to overlook. I don't like how buying a factory pays the player to your right (why?), the way your money tends to be huge or nothing (affecting auctions). At the end of the day I'm just not very good at "nickle and dime" economic games. But I want to play again, it got under my skin.

If Sid Sackson had created a hardcore economic game, it would have been something very similar to Container. Much like the great Sackson economic games such as Acquire and Executive Decision  (which are lighter), this game uses a simple rule set to create a self-contained economy that is driven by player decision. I would even say that this is more directly player influenced as players are constantly producing goods for sale, buying and selling to each other, and creating their own market economy in the process. The gaming styles and personalities will heavily influence how tight or loose this economy will play.

Well, kind of. The game definitely tries to keep things on the tight side with scarce money and slow, expensive production and goods movement. It is so tight in fact, that the game almost feels a little long at times, even though the play time isn't long at all. I'm starting this one at an 8 because of this. I love Sackson and I love heavy games. Although 8 is a great score for me, I thought this game had the potential of hitting a 9 or 10 out of the gate. After a few more plays, it may get there, but with a game so heavily dictated not only by player choice, but player personality and one's innate evaluation skills, it will take some time to sort out the weaknesses of players from the weaknesses of the game. Great fun, no matter my score.

RATING: 10
Purchased Fall 2007.

The short answer:

Mechanically easy yet tactically rich, Container is consistently great and largely ignored. It is a transcendent micro-economic experience in which players create the economy and determine the cost and value of everything within it. The game system is brutal to those who ignore others and go it alone and often rewards the individual brave enough to pave their own way while keeping tabs on other players' needs. The value others place on commodities can be quite opaque at the outset but a watchful player can start to see purchasing patterns as the game unfolds. 

Container features everything I love about modern games: intense player interaction, emerging partnerships, tactical adjustments, variable sessions, and a unique experience each time out.

The long answer:

It's been mentioned that the game is fragile; I would say it is dynamic. It is true the game provides no protection or insurance against poor play, nor does it feature catch-up mechanics. However, what the game does provide is a foundation upon which players will build and police an economy all their own, an economy whereupon all values are fluid from play-to-play. 

Container is anti-solitaire. Each decision will effect the other players and there is no selfish action to be taken. If you want to produce you have to pay the union boss (player on your right). If you want to buy containers for your harbour you must do so from another player. If you want to buy containers for your ship you must do so from another player's harbour.

Container is dynamic with different paths to victory emerging each session. One session may find a shipper winning, the next someone who specializes in producing or in wharehouses. The person who does the best is often the one who doesn't follow the herd.

Container is brutally realistic. Supply and demand function how they would in a real enviorment. Not paying back your loans can kill you as the bank rightly siezes your assests. No negative VPs in this game (ahem Agricola). If you don't repay, the bank will gets its money.

If you like intense player interaction, fluid markets, variable sessions, and realistic micro-economics, then I can think of no better recommendation than Container.

Rating based on about 20-25 plays thus far.  Kind of have a love-hate relationship with this game, given many of my fellow gamers don't seem to care for it all that much.  There is little luck, and the mechanics (once you get through the learning curve) are relatively easy.  The secret victory conditions may be off-putting to some.  For me,the biggest drawback is the poor color schemes they used for the products in the game -- three of the colors are very difficult to distinguish from one another!  Still, a very solid game and one of the top new games from Essen 2007 (just behind Tribune and Kingsburg, which were IMHO the top two that year).

RATING: 9
The love-it-or-hate-it reputation kept me away from Container for a while, but no longer. 

Container is a game about manufacturing stuff and selling it to another player who will sell it again to another player who auctions it off to the highest bidder. Sounds kind of ridiculous. In fact, it's a blast. You eke out what margins you can along the way, and only at the end of the chain does profit flow in from outside the game. The system is simple and innovative, and it's neat to see a mostly closed economy with realistic gains. This is not rags to riches. You fight for your modest profits in Container.

On your turn you get two moves. You can produce new goods, purchase a new factory or warehouse, or move your container ship to pick up, transport, or deliver goods. Each player's scoring conditions are different, which means everyone approaches the auctions with different values in mind. It's a simultaneous blind bid, which in this context is a stroke of genius because you can infer a lot about other player's secret scoring goals by their bids on various shipments.

Container pulled me in right from the setup. It is innovative, approachable, smooth, satisfying, and challenging. I would play this with hardcore gamers but also with my parents over the holidays. Few games do this; take note.

This is a quite dry game, and probably not for everyone. It's sligthly repetitive, and the theme is not very strong.
I like the art work, even though the colors could have been better (too similar).
I expect this game doesn't work so well with a group of mixed player experience.

On the positive side, this is a very, very good economic game. The game flow is good and the auction part is great.

The economic system is very tight... amazingly tight. You have to act very carefully to get the outcome you desire, and have a very keen sense of what everyone is doing in the game.  

During my only experience (with 5) I was very engaged by the game, and everyone else seemed to enjoy it as well. I want to try it with 4, but 5 performed better than I thought it would. 

I think this game might be a 9, I have strong urge to play it again right now!

UPDATE: Played with 3 which was only a bit odd. The game is probably better at 4 and 5, but it was quite good with 3 and better than I thought it would be. I still feel this game might be a 9, perhaps once I try it with 4 I'll decide.

RATING: 8
An economic game from my favourite author Franz-Benno Delonge - a perfect fit! And Container didn't disappoint. It incorporates economic concepts in a way that I haven't seen in a game before, e.g. deflation. If players spend too much to the bank the amount of money decreases and causes deflation. Gamewise this can lead to a grinding halt and could provide for a long and not very pleasant game experience. Just as it would be in real life. Another subject is collusion between players which can break the game if players decide to form an alliance to make overpriced bids for each others goods. Also state subsidiaries are modelled in the game to enable inter-company trade. It's not as intense in modelling supply and demand as I had expected from the rules but that might be due to our group consisting of new players not being able to evaluate the game situation good enough and exploiting it.
In sum Container is a unique game with great depth while the rules are astonishingly simple. One of the trademarks of Delonge.

RATING: 5
A Puerto Rico-esque game (which I love), but with significant differences that weaken the game significantly:

1. Puerto Rico has the plantations to randomize the game throughout; Container only has random setups (which aren't really that random), plus the chaos introduced by one's opponents. It's a minor difference, but I do not see replayability between good players.

2. The investment decision to reward phase is very long (3+ turns), and highly susceptible to one's opponents. Since one is dependent on one's opponents for economy, a misjudgment on your part (or their part) hurts massively. It's even worse because of the long lead time of decision to benefit. At times, watching the decisions is like watching a train wreck unfolding in slow motion, but being unable to do anything about it.

3. Puerto Rico can suffer from the same weaknesses, but the possible choices are easier to see (e.g. they might Captain, forcing me to ship my coffee), and generally quicker to correct, either with a new strategy, a building, or roll choices. With better players, it's easier to predict likely moves, which helps. It's really hard to tell in Container whether one's decisions are good (or bad), so one's opponents likely have to struggle through the whole game with them, and even if you lost, it's not readily what set of decisions were the major decisions.

Fun economic game with a cost-benefit analysis that is really complex (and thus will either create a lot of analysis paralysis or get rid of it almost entirely). What I really like about this game is how the market is totally based on the way players actually play. It can end up being a very different game each time depending on the mix of player personalities. Unfortunately, the game has really poor quality components.

Right off the bat strikes me as a powerhouse of an economics game. But I have concerns about how much your cash flow stream is ultimately out of your control, and relies on other players choosing your good instead of other similaly priced goods. Or maybe it is just the interplay of the length of the game and the lack of direct control that gets to me. It just feels like you have to try to make the best of what is largely an unmanageable economic system, and folks can get windfalls just as easily from luck as good play. Don't get me wrong- I like it, I just don't love it.

Container was a game that for some reason I was very hesitant about picking up, but once I played I found it to be a refreshingly unique game experience.  

The components are passable.  I like the ships, the containers are fine, though I find the choice of colors (for both containers and player colors) a little strange - why not go for a greater color difference?  I really like the artwork on the cards, box and player boards, though the island itself seems a little weak.  The cards seem a little flimsy and the player boards seem a little warped and of low quality.  I find the game to be overpriced for the quality of components that you receive.

The gameplay is fun and feels different than most economic games, which seem to deal (at least these days) with engine building.  You do have to build up your infrastructure, but the key here is interactive pricing - controlled greed and a good idea of what is more attractive to certain players.  Initially the system seems very clunky, but after a couple turns you realize that it works quite smoothly and seems to simulate supply/demand and other economic principles quite well (for someone like me who knows nothing about economics).

My one problem with how the game plays is that it goes too long - hopefully experience will bring the play time down.

A very difficult game to rate. Its a clever game and one I would certainly like to play again, but the game's abstraction from the real-world just doesn't make any sense. You produce containers to sell to another player, to buy it back, to auction off to yet another player. 

The flow of the game was just very unintuitive. But the economic side was interesting though. Players try to judge the value of items and match the market to make the most profit. Very much like a complicated version of Modern Art.

I appreciated how you get an economy in a box - producing, supplying, selling and providing, the strong and continuos player interaction, I even found the blind bidding enjoyable, of course, tense. The game felt very subtle, kind of slowish but going on at a steady pace. Many times I felt I wanted to do more than I could achieve in two actions, but I can see the purpose of this constraint in the game. I could plan ahead like two or three turns.
Neither of us took out a loan, at times I was low on money though. Two player built two warehouses and two factories, and two had three of both. At one point I almost miscalculated the number of my containers and was in danger of having to get rid of my most valuables one, but I had time to make correction by winning an auction.
Next time I will try to price my container a little bit higher, but of course, it will depend on the game. I can see every game being different.
One player tried the strategy of buying only a few container, and rather collecting money, but it was not a winning strategy.
If I could see us being able to get the boys play Container, I would surely buy it.
Update: bought and played it with our sons, and they loved it. Moreoever, I did not buy a whole lot of containers,  but still came in first this time. Lots of different paths to victory, and you continually have to watch the others!

Suffers from a group think playing style. With the same players or stubborn players this will lose replayability fast. Some nice ideas but I'm coming round to the suggestion there are better end to end trading games out there, but I have yet to find one...

Update: Played again, found it more rewarding by not investing in so much infrastructure and pumping the economy in the auction phase. Hopefully it will begin to reveal it's mysteries to my group and they'll open up to it.

RATING: 5
Tentative rating after 1 play.

I need to play this again to get a good feel for the game. The choosing of the goods seemed pretty arbitrary. Somehow you need others to produce and then transport the goods that you need. It seemed that you get big points for selling goods on the Island and the double income you get is way too much of an incentive for you so you never buy your own goods (it is bad enough in Goa and Modern Art, but this is doubly worse). I had the feeling that more points can be had by just selling at the Island (more than half of my points came from one sale at the Island).

This game feels like Modern Art to me (unfortunately, I am not a fan of Modern Art).

My first game was a pretty amazing experience and I had an awesome time even though I came in last. My second game wasn't quite the same, but it was late at night and the game went terribly slowly due to distractions.

I keep telling myself that I don't like auction games but the blind auction in this one was fun and stressful.

Economic simulation, perfectly player-driver without the added hassle of having to work out a deal.  I price the goods, not some market, and you either buy them or you don't.  No haggling, and it's my decision.  The blind auction is a great mechanic, making people bid what the containers are worth to them instead of one more than what the containers are worth to someone else.

RATING: 3
Preordered it - Looking forward to giving this one a shot - sounds like it's right up my alley! Update: What a shame! I finally had a chance to play a game and I was very disappointed. I think this could be a fantastic game but it requires the effort of every player to learn the game and learn it well (so over 5 games) to get over the game hump. If you don't it kills the changes in the market so every bids for nothing. I tried to do some higher pricing and got boycotted. I couldn't wait for the game to end because of the mechanical feel, regardless of the nice look the game has. I feel it could have been better if a monopoly could be created (choice in factory producing colour) thus creating a demand for your product. Without that it forces diversity on what you create, which destroys part of the economic engine. It feels like the game plays you - not you playing the game... A real shame...

Like Agricola, I am rating this a 6 after my first play. Unlike Agricola, though, this one has a much lower ceiling. 

-Repetition, repetition, repetition. You are doing the same thing over and over and over. It's a clever market system, and I totally give it credit for that. Specialization pays. There are three things to specialize in, and two of them don't pay all that well unless you can manage volume that's unlikely with fewer than five. So... specialization in shipping pays.

-Lack of variability. The big differences are going to be in rather boring things like "Whoa, you just spent twenty on this bid instead of eighteen!" There isn't a whole lot here to keep my interest.

-Lack of narrative. What I sort of hold against this game a little bit is that you're producing, shipping, producing, shipping, a lot of the moves are fairly rote, and then... someoneboughtthelastbeigepieceHOLYSHIT game over. There's no arc, really.

These are minor complaints given the smoothness of the system. It's a little long but whatever. I don't mind losing, I mind doing the same things over and over and hoping for a different result.

An astonishing economic game. This pushes all my buttons: easy to teach, memorable rules, sensible gameplay, and elegant mechanics. There are a few wonky elements, thematically, but it's not hard to grasp how this plays. Games play out differently depending on the players at the table. The game is a framework for interacting with other players, and you never feel as though you a playing the game. A brilliant game. 

One complain is that new players can tip the game in the favor of more experienced players without realizing it. Player order can also matter here. Experienced players will often not buy from the person to their left because that only gives them more money on their turn. Inexperienced players won't see this.

I don't consider this a serious problem. The same thing happens in any complex game: the inexperienced players are at a disadvantage and can, through weak player, create opportunities that experienced players exploit. It happens all the time in everything from Agricola to Hansa Teutonica. So, yes, the game is better when everyone at the table has a reasonable level of experience. But to me that's a sign of a game that I want to play because I know I'm playing against other players, through the mechanics, rather than against the mechanics.

RATING: 8.5
Okay, the theme is admittedly dry and fairly abstract--you're producing containers (of anonymous color--they're not necessarily symbolic of anything), warehousing them, and/or shipping them to a fantasy island in the middle of your dinner table.  But ironically part of this dryness is what makes the game shine. 

Take the abstract layout as an example: the sea on which you float is your dinner table and the game is completely comfortable acknowledging that fact.  There's a self-referentiality  to it.  Container says, "Hey, it's clear that I'm a game you're playing at your dinner table, so let's bring your dinner table into the mix."

This demand that the game makes on its players is partly a product of being dry--players need to use their imaginations to put themselves in the position of container-shipping robber barons.  

But this demand is not simply a factor of theme, it's an essential part of the gameplay. Because the economy of this game is equally imagined by its players.  Prices are set not according to predetermined rules--a flow chart in a rule book--but by the supply/demand mood set by the players themselves.  Again, Container says, "Listen, yes I'm a game. We all know that. But I'm going to ask that you pretend I'm not a game; pretend instead that I'm a real economy, one that grows organically as money becomes available through smart business practices, and one that can also shrink to death-knell size if inflation and incautious spending run rampant.  You are both the only producers in that economy and the only consumers.  What you do within those roles is up to you, but the one with the most market savvy wins." 

With these demands, dryness suddenly becomes immersive.  When Container clicks, the dinner table truly does become the ocean, and players begin behaving like buyers and sellers on fantasy island, working within an economy they've created for themselves.

Reading other's reviews, I see the word "repetitive" used.
I don't understand this, as you're trying to adapt to what goods are out and how you can influence the shipping of goods you need.
The word that comes to mind for me is "dynamic."

I can agree with "dry," as it's an economy game, but not "boring."

The game's mechanism is pure and not luck based.  
It's a winner in my book.

This game was slightly difficult to figure out at first, and I know there is a lot of strategy that is lost with only 3 players perhaps, but I really liked it and the mechanics of trying to get the color containers you want, while not just trying to get the highest valued one because it will be lost and trying to get other people to purchase the colors you want to have on the island too. Very subtle and clever game. Cool ship pieces too!

A surprisingly deep game. The rules are simple but the strategy is not immediately obvious and indeed depends a great deal on what other players are doing.

Extremely interactive game.  I happen to like the materials (especially the ship).  The colour scheme is a bit hard to deal with, but I guess they needed 10 different colours.  In terms of gameplay, this is pure economic, with almost no game-input except the almost impossible to quantify final-value of each container.  

I almost got hit with the economic death spiral, but I was able to dispense my loans with a timely auction that saved me.  I can see why it would be annoying to be stuck with loans right when prices plummeted.  The trick is not to get stuck with loans.

RATING: 7
Strange, complex and unforgiving but intriguing economic game. The starting economic system is extremely tight on money. Avoid investing too much on infrastructure in the early game, as this is not a game of building an ecomomic engine but more a game of accurately predicting market shortages/opportunities. The economic system is by design also very fragile and unstable (and can even completely collapse due to player decisions and interaction). Going bankrupt is an option and can be difficult to avoid.

Container's economic model is completely and utterly broken and relies on players to play in a very specific way to keep the game from breaking down. Probably could've been a good game with plenty more playtesting and tweaking, but as it is, Container is one of the worst game I've ever played.

The unique economic scheme of this game is just great.  It plays pretty quick, and obviously gets everyone interacting well.  Can be played casually or aggressively.

Pure economics game with player having direct significant impact on the money supply.  You have to salute a game where loss leaders, credit crunch and money supply are all relevant concepts.  Fairly mean, minimal randomness (just starting cards & machines).  I like this but it's not for everyone.  I would rate this higher for it's mathematical soundness but the dryness pushes it into a niche.

RATING: 8
Self contained economy in this game can quickly make someone bankrupt or head into a near death spiral if you aren't careful.  Basically, this game is a three tiered economic structure of making goods, buying/selling goods as the middleman, and likely selling goods as the shipper (although you can choose to pay the high bid and keep your own load, thus taking precious money out of the game!).  It appears that you generally want to pursue one of three strategies (shipper & factory, shipper & warehouse, or factory and warehouse).  Whoever can find the niche market will likely do better.  This game can feel very repetitive as you are often doing the same actions over and over again - this seemed to be the major complaint in our first play although I think future plays might be faster and thus it won't feel such.

I really like Container. It manages to simulate a market with players producing, selling, shipping, and buying all what has been produced. Nothing is sold to the 'bank' or bought from the 'bank'. This requires a certain way to play the game, to get it going. Players have to watch out that enough money stays within the game. It is the best economic simulation game I have played so far and a very unique one as well.

Interesting economic game that encourages players to balance three different ways to earn revenue -- production, purchase of raw goods and shipping/auction.  The ability to set one's prices makes the markets particularly interesting.  I like how the elimination of all containers of your most numerous color influences people's bidding during the auction in difficult-to-predict ways.

RATING: 7
A game with many clever twists.  The design FORCES player interdependency in a way rarely seen in a euro design.  Three plays in and I've yet to win.  It seems I'm always getting stuck throwing away my high-value containers, or lacking the rainbow of containers on the island.  This opacity is a good thing.  It's a tough game.

Note that the color scheme on this is among the worst ever produced.  The boards warp and the ships crack (mine were chipped as soon as I opened the box.)  Factor in all this and I'm not quite sure the game is worth its retail price.  I am seriously considering selling off the game and re-creating it with Legos.

Container is a very good game... provided you don't mind the driest theme and the ugliest board I've ever seen for a board game and rules that sound way more complicated than they actually are! Once in game though, the mechanic flows very well and isn't hard at all. The things I like most about container: how it forces players interactions, how it teaches valuable economic lessons that are also true IRL and finally it's high dynamics to mechanics ratio (to use MDA terminology). 

The more players are familiar with it, the better Container becomes.

Note to newbies: when the money stops flowing, the game slows to a crawl. Also, fulfilling what nobody is doing is often a winning strategy.

[microbadge=5]

It's staggering how the economy works in this game.  It's definitely not a coöperative game, but you need to work with other players just to make sure that the system doesn't implode on itself.  Constantly while playing, I wonder how on Earth I was going to make my next turn work, only to be saved by some friendly opponents who purchased from my factories or harbors for their own ends, keeping me afloat for just one more turn.  It's crazy to me that any selfish action not only costs you money but removes money from the closed system completely, while the only way for money to actually enter the system is to set up opponents to fulfill victory conditions on their manifests.  This isn't a coöp, but it does walk a fine line between cutthroat and coöperative just to survive.

Rating as a shipping containers simulation is a 10; rating as a game is a 7. It's long, somewhat repetetive and monotonous, and not too terribly intesting as a board game.

I can see how it's a good game.  But it feels more like a model of microeconomics disguised as a game.  And I'll give it that -- it's an extraordinarily organic model of microeconomics.

Played the base Valley Games version of the game.  The game was very fun.  I found the game to be pretty fun.  You can build factory or warehouse space.  Other actions include buying goods or moving you ship.  If you go to your island, you don't keep your goods, you auction them offer.  Offers from players are matched by the bank or you can match the high bid yourself and keep the goods.   

If people try buying their own containers, the game will break down.  But this does not seem like it would occur often.  

A solid game but it may need expansions.

It's probably a really good game, but their decision to create pieces that were "orange," "a slightly different color of orange," and "brown, but really close to orange," didn't go over too well with this colorblind guy.  No more plays for me unless someone modifies their copy to make it friendly.

First impression after two games (4 & 5p).  An elegant and interesting economics game that unfortunately is too heavy/difficult for my skills.  Definitely a seminal game that every gamer hobbyist should experience at least once.  The rules are so well designed, elegant, and simple, that they stand out of the way, allowing the entire focus to be on the board and the interaction among the players.  My main reluctance is that I don't have the computational power nor the will to climb the steep learning curve and be a competitor in this type of game.  My first two plays have been two very humbling experiences.  I feel that in order to be able to play this game well one has to either crunch the numbers or play it often enough to better understand it, and I don't have the desire/energy to crunch the numbers and don't have enough time to get better at it.  In spite of the above comment, it is so elegant and intriguing that I want to play it again before I pass final judgment.

Impressive blend of simple rules and a complex market dynamic that just appears out of thin air. Even in our first game, several strategies developed - for instance, I landed at third place without having any containers on my island at all - and after the first two rounds of 'what am I doing here, exactly' everything ran smoothly and became more and more engrossing.

Played once.

Really a simple, complex, colorful, strategy game. I have some very trivial complaints that aren't even worth mentioning except one of my ships arrived broke. I glued it though with some gorilla glue which worked great. Luckily, it was a clean break. Good as new now! This is one of my favorite new games!

Traded for Fury of Dracula.

After one play, I liked it.  It does suffer from the same fate as many other auction centric games (Modern Art, Wabash Cannonball) in that novice players can skew the game by over or under bidding for things.  I think once that is overcome, the game will get more interesting.  

I also look forward to trying once around auctions instead of blind auctions.

--

Still doing blind auctions.  This game is delightfully weird and challenging.

I always seem to get stuck in the mid to late game with the other players shipping loads to the island that are net-negative for me.  I need to figure out how to manipulate the game away from that...

A little dry, but a very interesting economic game.

As I've played it more I really like the multiple strategies and the ways that the player's dictate the economy.  It can settle into group-think, but the system makes it so easy to experiment, that you can try to disrupt preconceptions pretty easily.

6/17/09: One of the most amazing economic games I've ever played.  The players have to work together to keep the economy running, as well as plan their own moves to benefit themselves more than anyone else.  I've seen games with plenty of irrational exuberance and thus high scores, and a couple where the economy nearly collapsed.  Fantastic game that I'm eager to play again.

An Interesting Game.  While I don't get the visceral joy of firing artillery or invading another planet, I find myself thinking about the game strategy for several days after the game is over.

I think this is because the players are so instrumental in establishing an economy, and because it's easy to see parallels outside of the game.

After the initial few turns the game just became a repetition of the same steps.  Also the manufacturing quality was absolutely awful.

RATING: 5
The game rules once explained seem pretty intuitive but I noticed players kind of fumble through the first game as they are not really sure what to do next.

I played an incomplete game once at FallCon - the Valley game guys are a great bunch - especially Torben - tons of fun playing with him.  His enthusiasm is great.  

Communication from the Valley games website has been non-existent and that has been annoying. 

My copy arrived through the mail; it has warped boards and was missing the extra bonus stuff I should have recieved for pre-ordering.  The color scheme for the containers is poor - the colors are too similar even with really good light.  I can't imagine the mistakes I would make in low light conditions.  Three shades of orange/tan just doesn't work.

Tried it again with 3 players - not sure if I enjoyed it quite as much as a 5 player game.  

I think it is really important to get a few well timed shipments over to the island to win.  You really need both the gov't donation and your opponents offering to get going because money is so tight.  Once one opponent gets a lot more cash than the rest of the players it might be hard to stem the tide.  The train keeps a rollin for them and grinds to a halt for you.

Getting behind with loans is a sure way to lose.  If you need money, only plan on borrowing for a few turns maximum.  The interest rate is just too high to ignore.

The game needs more plays for me to provide a firm rating... but for now a 6 seems about right...

Played a full game - 5 players - the game went on too long - only three of us were really producing goods.  The game is dryer than I would have liked - it just seemed to lack excitment.  I think shipping is the biggest key to the game.  The cash incentive from the government might be a touch too good.  I overpayed for the last ship on the last turn and perhaps gave the game to my opponent (by only a few dollars)...  If players are bidding 15 or more dollars for a shipment that is at least 30 dollars to the shipper if they take the money... that is a pretty big windfall.  If someone can do that early in the game they probably will have it made.

The economy of scale is a super interesting domain and this game does well to recreate it.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  It's a bit intimidating at first, but when you get the hang of it after a couple turns, it's way more intuitive than one can think.  

To play ABSOLUTELY with the second shipment expansion.

The player-created economy is interesting.  Initial rating is 7.5.  Not sure if this will settle in at 7 or 8 for me.  The concept is pretty compelling, but it seemed to drag on a bit in the mid-to-late game.  I don't mind long games, but this got a bit repetitive, I thought.  If goes faster in subsequent plays it could be an 8.

Version with wooden AND plastic containers

Initial rating after 1 3-player & 1 5-player game:
Very interactive economic game. Need to play this a lot more to find out the various strategies.

UPDATE after 4 plays: raised my rating half a point. But only for 5 (or minimal 4) players. Still can't seem to get a grip on this game, but I like it anyway. Very interactive.

NL: wow, dit is anders! Je maakt spullen die je aan anderen te koop biedt, de spullen die je van anderen koopt biedt je weer te koop aan om te verschepen, en de spullen die jij weer gekocht hebt en verscheept biedt je weer te koop aan op de eindbestemming. Na 2x spelen wil ik 'm erg graag weer doen om te kijken wat voor strategien je er op los kunt laten.

After 3 plays.  Clearly, as an economic game, it can be considered very good.  My problem is that I've come to dislike games without geometrical considerations (I call these spreadsheet games, because they can be played as well or better on an Excel Spreadsheet as on a board with bits.)  Don't let this stop you though.  As an exercise in pure profiteering, it's really good. If I liked this kind of game, I would probably adore it.

Not a bad game, but one where I have a sneaking suspicion seating order could have a real impact.  Some good mechanisms, although really strange how you can't sell to yourself.  The colors are a little odd.

June '14: another play has dropped the rating.  Goes on too long.  All the goods are the same and little in the way of variation in prices possible.  Goes on long past the time wherein you have interest.  Not a super fan of the blind bids.  Once the game established, no more building, and the,n the same manipulations over and over.  Seating order critical.

Very good rendition of market economics. However, the game is also extremely chaotic -- you don't actually have much control over goods that are available, their prices, when they get delivered to the island, etc. I would much prefer to not have so much hidden information (hidden objectives; blind bidding), which I think would give me an increased level of feeling in control.

2008-02 This is the ultimate supply/demand game.  Players who enjoy buying, selling and trying to carve out the best profit margin may really enjoy this.  I like the premise quite a bit but found that the game play gets repetitive after awhile  and a lot of my moves felt determined by what options were provided by the other players rather than what I wanted to do.  Since it's meant to be a commodity speculation game the tactical nature was frustrating at times.  Perhaps my  outlook will improve upon further play but for now it's too dull to get excited about.

Really quite a good economic game.  Perhaps excellent and a classic (which it is in some gamer's minds).

Haven't played nearly enough games to properly assess, but I've enjoyed the games that I've played so far.  Straightforward rules, but not so straightforward strategies, I think.  Some elements of group think and the economy can be fragile...

Good tie-in between game mechanics and theme for a euro/economic game.  Glad I was able to obtain a copy before it was priced out of reach.

I just can't wrap my head around this game. If I hold out hope that there is some rhyme or reason to the arbitrary pricing of the goods during any of the three points of sale, then after two plays I declare it broken. If I instead accept that an equilibrium economy is the natural state of this game and the real meat is in the psychological fake outs of the auctions given the individual players' hidden scoring valuations, then there's not enough information to go on and the other 3/4 of the game is a waste of time.

Most likely the game is using the slightest variance in the economy as information to help determine the hidden valuation of others' so as to maximize one's edge in the auction, but this neither works nor is interesting. I'd say I'm waiting for someone to prove me wrong but honestly I don't think I'd be listening.

Love this delicately balanced, tightly funded, build, produce, pick-up and deliver to "auction-island" economic game. It's like no other game I've played. The bits and boards are very nice, especially the resin ships; the rules booklet is excellent.

Regarding gameplay: 1) The blind auctions work very well; the decision whether to sell the goods to the highest bidder or buy them yourself is often very difficult; 2) Finessing the total number of containers you own in each color to maximize your endgame score is challenging and fun. Apparently [i]Container[/i] is at its best with four or five players, but I've really enjoyed it with just three. The expansion, "The Second Shipment," is well worth having. [5 plays]

RATING: 8
Rating after first play. While I had damn fun playing it, I almost feel like the economy is too loose - our game ground to a halt in the final round, as I was the only player with cash, and I was unwilling to spend it on actions. Secondly, another player made such a terrible early mistake that he was basically out of the game and sat there feeling frustrated for an hour - that's a pretty major flaw.

I will absolutely say yes to future games, and my opinion may change with those plays, but for now I am reserving judgment.

-------

5/21: Update. After a second play I can say that although the above concerns remain, our game was so tight, so intense, and so much fun that the game at very least deserves another half-point ratings bump. I am particularly interested in the extent to which the actions on my turn create situations that encourage or discourage particular actions on my opponents' turns. This is a great game, and I can't wait to play it again.

Valley Games pre-order.  Recieved 06/01/2008.  Components are all of good quality.Played once at BayCon 2008 with 4 players.  I enjoyed my first play very much.  The rules are very easy to read, understand and teach.  The game models a cute supply and demand mechanic that prevents players from buying their own wares, so enforcing cooperation and some fun price setting of containers.

Container is definitely an interesting game, perhaps moreso conceptually than in actual play. I got out of sync in my first game and did not react properly, so the game became quite dull as I felt myself lagging further behind. In my second game, I watched another player fall into my same position but respond correctly and ultimately win the game. Unfortunately, that led to me falling out of sync in this second game, though that was more the fault of the player to my right, who was in a position to respond to the former player but did not. I suppose with more experience, I could have pointed this out and gotten him to shift gears, but then again I generally find "advice," particularly in games like this, to be highly suspect: players think they know how to play well, but all they really know is the groupthink they've previously experienced. I think [boardgame=118][/boardgame] provides a similar and more fun experience in far less time, but that's one of my favorites; echoes of it here are actually nice, and I'm interested in messing around with this system some more.

An intriguing free-form economic game, where the pace of the game is largely set by the player styles. There's a bit of a game flaw for new players where all the money can be drained from the economy quickly by too much building or buying one's own offers, but that can be avoided with a little coaching.

My only complaint about the game is that it's a tiny bit dry, which I'm hoping the expansion will help, whenever it's available again....

This is one I may really have to play before purchase. For 3-5 players. Runs ~120 mins.

You produce goods that are purchased by other players. You set the price and have limits on how many containers you have available to store. Other people ship your stuff to an island and they try to sell it. The end game scoring combines profits with container values in your purchase area; although you throw out the color of container with the highest number of pieces.

It is more of an economics game than anything and cannot be played as multiplayer solitaire. It requires constructive player interaction.

Sounds very, very interesting.

A very interesting economic game that covers production, sale and shipping of goods.  Although the game appears very complex at first blush (partly due to the way the rules are presented), the mechanics are quite simple.  The unforgiving part is HOW you use the mechanics.  This game will KILL you if you expand too fast, or mis-price your goods, or buy the wrong goods, or . . . . The two most important rules (IMHO) are (1) you can only have 2 loans and (2) you discard the goods you have the most of on the Foriegn Island.  Pay close attention to these rules.

This has to be one of the finest games ever designed. In a sense, the designer did not create the mechanics--the mechanics are a nearly perfect microcosm of pure economics! What the designer did was to condense actual economics into a playable board game! I introduced this to the table this week for our gaming group. Some of us are gaming fanatics, and some were very casual, almost no game experience at all. And everyone at the table just kept saying all night, "Wow, what an incredible game! How simple, and yet strategically deep." It is all about your skill in valuing the containers. Value them well, and you will win. Value them poorly and you will lose. That simple.

Unique game that simulates a closed economy, circulated currency and all. Prone to groupthink, and one needs to be able to form dedicated mini-unions with other players to have any hope of raising prices above rock bottom. In short, it's up to the players to balance the game.

RATING: 6
Preliminary rating after a single play.  With 5 players it seemed to take an age to get going to the point where market forces came into play to actually change prices and by that time the game was nearly over.  There's probably a good game in there trying to get out but I have a fear that you would have to analyse it to death to get it.  As it is it feels a little "random."

Great game - we 'discovered' Franko through this game (great shame), and now have Dos Rios to try sometime too.
Container though is a great little economic engine game - though ostensibly a little dry, I love the theme of making selling, transporting and auction.

BTW - I thought Power Grid: Factory Manager would be like some echo of this, but it isn't - both great games in their own right - I have a fondness for Container over PG:FM though.

While I like the idea of playing Manufacturer/Wholesaler/Retailer, the problematic bits really detract from the experience. I also see AP becoming an issue with more players. (Based on a play with 3)

UPDATE: Craptastic components aside (Seriously, we started calling the "brown" containers diarrhea-colored), I've finally started to appreciate the ebb and flow of the game here. A few of the rules are still bizarre such as the whole deal with paying the player to your right to produce stuff. But now I'm glad I spent the money to buy this.

RATING: 7.5
I like how all the prices in the game are manipulated by players. It works, and it's about capturing the right timing and to be the right end of the production chain. A minor nitpick is that the first play can leave a bad impression to new players simply because the game is very, very unforgiving. Getting past that and it's indeed a very tactical game that's both very thematic (as it's a simulation of real economics!) and competitive.

In this game, everyone has a player mat, where there are factories for producing goods (five different kinds of goods are available), warehouses to store goods, and players have a ship that can load goods. Each player is dealt a card, outlining the secret values of the goods, which is the worth to them, but not the same as the other players. The actions available to a player are build a factory, produce goods, buy warehouses, buy goods for warehouses, load goods into their ship by buying from someone else's warehouse or auction off goods in the central island. Goods loaded onto the island count for VPs as indicated by theri secret card, and money is equal to VP as well. The trick is that your highest number type of one good is discarded before calculating the score. The game could run a little longer than expected, and could be a bit dry, doing the same actions over and over. I need to get a few more games under my belt to see the different types of strategy.

[I always play "shorter game" i.e., remove as many containers as the number of players for each color. Then it is ideal 90-minute game]

It is a deceptively simple economic game with emphasis on making marginal profits, not on building infrastructures. It took me 3 games to start appreciating the system. I remember that my 2nd game was awful as everyone went to economical death spiral. However, it is easily avoided and once you know it, it is such a great game. Understanding the scoring system is a key to do correct bidding.

After 8 plays, now it is a 9. It is very very good.

Container is in many respects a near perfect economic game - it simulates the whole supply chain from production to warehousing to sales, it features subsidies and loans. It has great depth - very little analysis paralysis and fast turns. However, it's the kind of game you really need to give five or so games to shine, as the rewards are reaped once you master the rules.

RATING: N/A
Truly unique game. People often describe a certain type of games as "economy game", but usually the so called "economy" is a neat system that works according to well defined rules (that is, more like well regulated market).  I think that Container is an economy game whose economic system is flexible, subtle, and unpredictable enough to feel like the real one. The game is extremely open-ended; your playing experience can vary widely depending on how the people around table play collectively.

That being said, I'm not sure whether the realistic market simulation equals a good game. Maybe as an eurogamer I crave for some level of structure in my games. This game is so widely open that it is very hard to tell what to do. I'm pretty sure this is an extreme compliment in some people's book, and I am not criticising the game by any means. It just felt too strange to me...

RATING: 7
I like economic games and this is a good one.  The economic model, like many have stated, is a fragile one.  I suggest playing with the Domestic Sale Beginner Variant, as it adds that little bit of cash that keeps things going.  The game starts out a bit clunky and slow, and you must be incredibly careful not to overspend at first.  The last 2/3rds of the game gets very interesting, and there are some tense moments.  Strong bidding element.  The time requirement for this game is a long one, and even though I do enjoy this game, I can't decide if the time commitment is worth it for the fun/time ratio.  I guess I'll find out though, as I'm sure more plays of it are in my future.

I strongly suspect, that this is a great game. I read through the rules twice, played it once with my kids, and I simply love this simulation of economy. Each container gets sold three times until it finally gets "consumed", thus being no longer part of the market. What you need in order to win is possibly not what you need to produce. I'd love to play it with five (maximum) adult players, just to see how the complexity of economics evolve. Simple to learn, but hard to master - just great!

A truly odd game. The ships and container pieces means it looks lovely, but the game play is very strange. The need for goods to change hands several times before they can be scored makes it hard to manipulate the market to score more of the goods that you need most. I should try it again to see if it makes more sense a second time round.

To master this gamer's game, you'll need the skillz of an advanced Puerto Rico and Modern Art player. You are very much playing against the other players in a somewhat scripted milieu, scripted in that it is easy for all players to hit a groove and start performing the same virtuous cycle actions, at the expense of one or two players. Because of its open-endedness, seating matters. In a 5er, if you're sitting two seats away from someone playing the same strategy, with the player in between not playing to that strategy, you will effectively trounce the first player by simply pricing everything a bit more favorably. And if that first player is me, I will then kingmake against you so that a different player wins. So the game suffers from that. Also, it is extraordinarily AP-heavy, way too long, and dry as all hell.

I love this game, but you can get the odd "broken" game if players make serious mistakes, e.g. going bankrupt, or grossly overbidding for a shipment. But what a fascinating game it is - I just cannot get enough of it!

RATING: 6
Interesting system. One of the possible actions is to build machines. Machines can make containers with the production action. Offer those containers for other players to buy(another action type), once they are bought they are put in the warehouses(they can be built by a different action) in the buying player's harbor. Other players can buy those containers from the harbor and load them onto their ships. The ships can travel to an island where the containers are auctioned off in a blind auction. Either the highest bidder puts the containers in his area on the island and pays his bid to the auctioneer and the auctioneer gets the same amount additionally from the bank, or the auctioneer pays the highest bid to the bank and gets the containers. The movement of the ship from the open sea to a harbor is an action that includes buying containers, the movement to the island is an action that includes the auction. Moving to the open sea also costs an action. Each round there are two actions available to each player. There are five different kind of containers and their worth is different from player to player (at setup each player gets a card where the worth of their containers are shown). At the end of the game the acquired containers on the island are scored, but each player first discards the kind that they have the most of. To these scores are added the worth of containers left in harbors and on ships and the money acquired during the game. The auction has somewhat of a modern art feel, you don't want to bid too high, because you would benefit the auctioneer more than yourself, but betting too low could mean not winning anything. I think it is a solid game, but I feel that there isn't sufficient control of your own destiny. You can offer incentives to other players to help you, by lowering your prices, but they may choose not to help you, by not buying from you.

Two levels of buying and selling merchandise at variable prices, with little idea of how to value everything. And then a blind auction. This spells a guaranteed failure for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
First impression (4 players): The game is about buying/manipulating goods. Especially about manipulating them. The game might make sense mechanically but thematically it's really not making much sense. First a player must produce goods. Then somebody must buy them to his warehouses where someone else (could be the original producer) will buy them onto his freighter. After that goods can be taken to the island and sold.

Why cannot producing player sell goods straight to the ships? Why a player must buy goods from somebody else to be able to place them to his warehouses and cannot transport his own (cheaper) goods there? Why all the goods must travel between 2-3 players before somebody can buy them?

This isn't game breaking or anything but this moving back and forth just felt a bit silly while playing. A lot of energy (and time) is spend just to move goods around the table before anything meaningful happens. Somebody might make a couple of bucks but I'm not sure it adds that much to the game. I'm sure you can do some tricks with goods and their pricing and try to either prevent your opponents from getting goods or get compensation in cash. Unfortunately this isn't too much fun nor interesting.

I don't like too much of the games where you can lock yourself out of the game if you do too many wrong decisions. In Container you can run out of many and goods. Actually you don't even need to run out of goods because other players don't have to buy anything from you because it would help you out of your misery. This is easy to prevent by always having enough cash but it always feels wrong to me in games if it is "too easy" to get yourself to this position. In Container it's easy enough and I don't like that.

After all these negative thoughs I must admit there were couple details in the game I liked. The blind auctioning the goods on the island is interesting choice in otherwise quite deterministic game. Although I'm not completely sure how informed the bids can be in the first rounds since nobody has much true info about how valuable the goods are to other players. Every player has different secret values for 5 types of goods. As an added annoyance you'll be losing the category that you have most goods. Actually I'm not sure if they can have that info even in midgame. This is because you really want to have most of your least valued good and then a little bit less of your two highest valued ones.

One more interesting thing in this auctioning of goods is the goverment subsidy for goods. The seller gets double the highest bid. Half of the money comes from buyer and half from the bank. This is actually the pretty much only way to get more money to the game. I liked this little detail in the game. At least it made sense both thematically and mechanically.

Overall the game just feels a little bit clunky in many ways. There is nothing seriously wrong but not too many things done right either. Four player game was ok but because there is so much player-to-player buying and selling I think game might be better with 5 players.

Update: I played a (half) game with 3 players. After that I just want to add that you need at least 4 players to play Container.

Grandissimo gioco passato troppo sotto traccia e ora, disponibile solo a prezzi troppo elevati. Per molti aspetti mi ricorda un gioco Splotter. Ovvero gioco profondo con materiali ricercati ma al tempo stesso, per alcuni versi, pessimi per la poca praticità o chiarezza di alcuni dettagli tanto che il gioco sembra una versione test. Tra i difetti dei materiali trovo i colori delle merci, non chiari e non corrispondenti alle carte obiettivo, spazi dei porti non adeguati sia per ospitare navi che per mettere le carte dell'espansione, l'isola è decisamente brutta alla vista. A compensare parzialmente la cosa delle navi molto belle e particolari. Il gioco, da giocare esclusivamente con l'espansione e il mio voto tiene conto appunto di tale espansione che ne aumenta profondità ed interesse, è semplice e lineare ma al tempo stesso strategicamente complesso. E' un gioco di conti, di guadagni di domanda e offerta. Massima libertà per i giocatori di prezzare le merci in vendita, massima libertà in offerta per l'acquisto delle merci sull'isola e interessante la fase dei prestiti. Un piccolo gioiello che sarebbe opportuno riscoprire e magari rieditare.

Brilliant. You won't see the qualities of this game anywhere else. A kind of a simulation of economy, easy to learn and very absorbing - you have to handle with the production, the storage, the distribution, the shipping and you sometimes have to act even as the customer.

For your own benefit, PLEASE give Container a second chance if, at first time, it appears to be dry, weird, broken, whatsoever. It is not. Ok, maybe you can eventually disliking it anyway, but trust me, it deserves at least a second chance.

RATING: 6
Middleweight build-an-economy game. Cubes at the destination island score differently for each player according to their secret mission cards, and these drive a lot of the action beforehand. Players can build machines to produce goods, and decide the prices to sell at. They're then dependent on other players to buy them and store at their warehouses, usually at a slightly higher price. Someone different from the warehouse owner then needs to pay for them and ship them to the island where they get blind-bid for as a lot, where it's relatively easy for each player to determine their potential end-game profit and hence value the lost (minus the wibble that you don't score whatever you have most of, which needs to be taken into account). Profit can be made at each step of the process, so there's a number of ways to play a strategy - producer, warehouser, shipper, combination of the lot. The problem is that the game gets samey. Turns are fast with only two actions, but it's typically just buying and selling of cubes from here to there, squeezing out profit here and there, trying to get the most valuable cubes (for you) to the island for purchase. The other problem is that if the players are "over-paying" for goods at the island, then that's the only strategy you can effectively use so as not to fall behind ekeing out dribs and drabs from producing / warehousing. It's different enough to keep for a while, but it's not a game that screams play me from the shelves.

Tra i giochi della mia collezione, Container è quello che in assoluto si presenta peggio: quando lo proponi, viene notata per prima cosa la scarsa qualità delle plance e dei componenti in legno. A questo si aggiunge una pessima scelta dei colori, un vero e proprio incubo per i daltonici. Poi inizia la partita, e tutti scoprono che la grafica non è più importante: c'è un modello economico di domanda / offerta che pur non essendo macchinoso risulta estremamente realistico. A questo si aggiunge una profondissima interazione tra i giocatori: la farfalla che sbatte le ali in Cina provoca un uragano in America. Ogni mossa altera l'intero turno, proprio come il nostro sistema economico. Il rischio d'impresa è un fattore importantissimo, e vedersi pignorare i beni non è improbabile: quando la merce passa di mano, è necessario ritagliarsi un margine alto quel tanto che basta per rientrare nei costi, ma basso abbastanza da risultare conveniente e appetibile. Non è immediato percepire chi sta vincendo, e con gli obiettivi segreti il rischio Kingmaking è limitato. Inoltre, eliminare a fine gioco le merci più comuni, oltre a aggiungere realismo al gioco, rende i calcoli sugli avversari molto più complicati.
Non capita spesso di sentire dagli amici - "Lo giochiamo anche la prossima volta?" - prima che la partita corrente sia finita. Mai fermarsi alle apparenze: Container ha un brutto vestito, ma sotto nasconde un piccolo capolavoro.

This is an economic game in which you need to sell goods to other players in several stages before anyone gets to score them.  The ending auction feels a lot like Modern Art, in that you have a good idea what things are worth, but you don't want to pay too close to that because then you'd be giving the opponent way to much money.  At times, the game seemed to be pretty repetitive, and the endgame seemed to bog down into a giant game of chicken.  The choices of colors used in this game were poor.

I absolutely adore this game. The first time I played it, we played with a really bizarre house rule of adjusting your prices throughout the game without taking an action. It was frustratingly annoying and killed the spirit of the game for me. You could "wheel and deal" and I felt like it was trying to make this game something that it's not.

After playing it a second time, we played it with the rules as written and I can't stop thinking about it. The money was tight, I took out loans, had to price things competitively and bidding was intense. You weren't sure if you were paying way too much or if that was even enough to influence the decision of the auctioneer. I can't wait to play this game more, but I'm unsure who I can get it to the table with. It's a solid 9, but it may become a 10 with subsequent plays. A lot to explore and discover and it's all player based with no help if you start to flounder. Brilliant!

Wow. This is a very delicate game. Definitely not a game you want to play with new players. One player can very easily send themselves into total ruin and also completely wreck the economy in the game. The game is entirely player driven and needs an experienced group.

I play harsh games regularly - Age of Steam, Antiquity, 18xx - but this is one of the harshest I have seen. One game saw two players with loans that they could not pay the interest on resulting in the bank seizing all of their cash and assets. There is so little money in the game that every decision is critical and every dollar is important. This is definitely not an engine building game. Players must find a niche in the supply and demand network and make it profitable. It is very hard to do well, and is very harsh on mistakes. Sometimes just surviving can mean victory.

It seems to be all about pricing, but it isn't. Setting the right prices at the right times is important, but there are a lot of very subtle dependencies that players need to take into account to be successful. Anticipating the trends and adapting is the key to success. 

It reminds me of modern art, but with a lot more depth and options. I've read about how players can compromise the game for everybody, if they play badly, but that hasn't been an issue in our games at all. 

This is truly a masterpiece of game design from the late Franz-Benno Delonge,  his magnum opus!

UPDATE: Increased the rating to 9.5 after yet another very rewarding game!

Love playing this game with 5 players. Works with 4. Dislike playing it with 3. On another note, colour choices for ships and containers are poor (two ship colours look the same, as do two container types), which can be an issue for players with visual impairments.

RATING: 4
I probably would have given this  game a five but for the component colors -- the bits and two ships are so close in color that it could cause confusion if you're not paying close attention.

Economic game, where you're selling making products, buying products and ferrying them to an island in the hopes of making a profit -- all while collecting containers of your own. I liked the variable victory point cards but found it really difficult to do much planning (at least in a five-player game.)

Very abstract produce/ship/manipulate market game. The first play got me completely off base and I did really poor. I did not bother to calculate anything other than the cost of putting containers in my island and did terrible.
However, the game is very nice and models economic patterns very well. I have to give it more tries if I see it around. I don't think I would get this one on the basis that Ana Maria would not care for it at all.

Container is a game of supply and demand which is left entirely to the players to create and manage. The result is an extremely fragile system where one player can easily and completely unwittingly hand the game to another, simply by improper valuation or trying new tactics. I can see how Container could be a good game in a group of very experienced players, but the repetitiveness of the game and a play time easily double that listed on the box makes this exceedingly unlikely given its stiff competition for table time. What's more, I am not entirely convinced the game is not "broken" to the point that there is only one real viable strategy--that of shipping to the island.

That said, I love economic games and Container did grab me. Just not quite hard enough that I couldn't get away.

1 play. The rules seem convoluted at first, but after 1 round everything fell into place. The game reminds me a bit of Modern Art in that you can buy something, then drive up the price when re-selling. The scoring is more convoluted than I like, but it does create some tense moments. While the art/design is quite dreary,  the components aren't nearly as bad as some chronic complainers here would have you believe. All in all a decent game.

Interesting economics game where everything is very player driven. Players set prices on their goods, and then they get to move their boats to purchase those goods from other players, looking to get the best price and type. Then they deliver those goods to an island for scoring. Judging the market and making sure you make out on every transaction is pretty much the game. I liked this more when I first played it years ago. Now it feels a little slow, and I have trouble getting excited about the process..

I tried this game twice now, once with 4 and once with 5. While I like the idea and economic games normally appeal to me, this was horribly executed. The game is heavily dependent on other players actions. If they don't do the things you need then you are stuck on your turn. Further, while the game is supposed to simulate a supply and demand market, in reality, few ever set prices above the minimum. On one play someone tried to set more realistic prices and got buried by everyone else selling for cheap. The market just doesn't exist. It becomes a boring game of executing the same actions over and over mechanically, until a winner is declared. I won the second game and still couldn't wait for it to be over.

Very powerfull economic game.It's all about the demand vs the availability. You have to be able to produce and sell you good with the best profit margin at each stage (out of the factory, from your dock and at the island market) according to the demand. You also have to take in to acount the demand of your clients. This makes it one of the best most complete economic game out there.
The material is O.K. but the rules could be explained a little bit better. The playing time is interresting considering the depth of the game.

Jeu très puissant d'économie. Tout dépend de la demande vs la disponibilité des marchandises. Vous devez être en mesure de produire et vendre vos marchandises avec la meilleure marge de profits à tous les niveaux (à la sortie de l'usine, aux quais et au marché de l'île) selon la demande. Vous devez également prendre en considération les demandes de vos clients. Ceci en fait l'un des meilleurs jeux d'économie et l'un des plus complet. Le matériel est bien mais les règles pourraient être mieux expliquées. Le temps de jeu est intéressant considérant la profondeur du jeu.

RATING: N/A
I'm supposed to give the disclaimer here that I've only ever played this once, and online to boot. And since this game is obviously brilliant, no one is allowed to say negative things about it, as that would be proof of their unbrilliance in the face of the game's sheer brilliance. And we can't have that. Because who wants to appear unbrilliant? Nobody. 

I refuse to believe the nonsense that this game is an economic simulation. In no economy I'm aware of do you guess at pricing without knowing who your buyers are. Economies also don't use blind bidding, which might be correct here for a game mechanism, but it's wonky in a "pure" economic game. And nobody stays in business for very long if they insist that their buyers also buy unrequested, bundled goods of a completely different type. 

This game really advances  a buck at a time. Produce a good, someone stores it, someone ships it, and someone else buys the damn thing when made into a set that may or may not include something else they want. So the game is economic in that you have a bunch of middlemen who don't need to be there, boosting the cost for no real reason except to obfuscate the direct path to the consumer. 

Online we were able to track the bids and track the perceived valuations, and that would strike me as desirable in order to play this competently. It's not really possible to do that playing face-to-face, and so I'm hard-pressed to understand what playing it face-to-face does other than make it impossible (or socially awkward) to track the money flowing the way that online asynchronous play allows, where you can look at what this particular set of goods sold for last time it went to the island and price accordingly. I also felt completely powerless on many of my turns -- while I can concede that experience might mitigate that to a degree, the fact that you have to specialize means that your options are pretty limited on your turn, and too many times I felt like this economic machine was humming along, and when it got time for me to take my turn, I had to do my part to keep the machine going. A Geekbuddy once positioned this as a virtue, saying that the game is really about getting in and out of phase with the other players. And I believe that, but it's not like this happens every turn. To me this is a 20-turn game with maybe 5 interesting turns in it. The rest of the time you're just doing what you're supposed to do to prevent the game from locking up. Consequently, there is just no narrative arc to the game, no division between early-, mid-, and late-game periods. It's a game about enduring a dull, repetitive pattern in the hopes that you can recognize the handful of moves when the other players have created perfect conditions for you to earn an extra dollar. 

It kind of breaks my heart to read so many negative or indifferent comments on this game where the BGGer feels the need to self-flagellate and say that the problem most likely lies with them since the game is so well-received. This tendency to make oneself feel stupid has simply got to stop. This game is dry as fuck, drearily themed, and rewards the ability to spot a barely perceptible pattern difference in a game that otherwise lulls you to sleep with its wave-like rocking motion. I hereby grant everyone permission to state how they feel about Container without feeling the need to dock themselves a few IQ points.

I've played twice.  The first game I had no idea of strategy, the second game I think I had a better idea of what was going on.  I like the game a lot.

RATING: 7
Container is an economic game with a heavy emphasis on logistics.  It can bog down in dry repetitive accounting excercises, but the interdependence of the players on each other makes for some amazing player interaction.

Players have factories of various colors.  These produce like colored Containers that other players can buy.  The producing player can set the price of each Container.  Purchased Containers are placed in Warehouses.  Other players can then bring their ships into port to buy Containers from the Warehouses.  Again players can set the price of these Conatiners.  Ships can then ship the Containers to the Island where they are sold via blind bid auction.  The player who is auctioning the Containers takes the high bid and an equal amount of cash from the bank.  In this way money flows in to the game.  

Containers are worth different amount of points to each player and the exact value is secret.  Also before counting score a player must discard the color of container they have the most of.

So the trick is that anything you produce you cannot buy.  Anything you store in your Warehouses you cannot buy.  So if you need a particular color of Container to go up for auction in the middle you can't channel it directly from your Factory to your Warehouse to your Ship to the Island.  You are dependant on other players taking up part of the chain.

Furthermore, players can set the price at which they will sell Containers.  So players need to track supply and demand as well as the prices other players have set in order to get as much money as possible for their goods.  Storage space is limited so if you are not moving containers you are going to feel stifled.

Timing is also important and having cash in hand for an important auction is a critical part of the game.

Like any economy players need to look for a need that the current system is failing to provide and fill it.  In a game players will fill various roles since no one player can effectively focus on Factories, Warehouses and shipping simultaneously.  This is where the game shines.  If everyone is trying to ship then the player with the most Warehouses will reap a windfall.  However Warehouses are useless without other players' Factories.  If no one is producing the game will grind to a halt, if one player is producing they can set their prices high and force others to pay it.  

Because eVerything is interrelated, players can break the game resulting in a failed economic state where players are poor, wealth isn't flowing into the game and piracy off Horn of Africa is the only option.  Since the piracy aspect is not part of the game, when poverty abounds the game drags.  There's nothing in the rules to save the players from themselves.

There are only a few actions a player can take on a turn while the game often lasts over two hours.  This can make it feel repetitive and tedious at times.

The saving grace is how tied together the players are.  They need each other in order to do well.  As a player it's a blast trying to create economic incentive for other players to do what you need them to do and still come out on top.

While it has a decent system of commerce, and decent player interaction, and cool pieces, the game is seriously broken. I was basically hosed at the start of the game, because no one would trade with me.  My factories were full and my warehouses were full and I had no money to buy anything from anyone else's warehouses because the timing, as the 4th player in a ring of three people producing, buying, and shipping, left me nothing to buy. I lowered all my prices to minimum, got a couple people to buy from me, and by refusing to buy from him, two of us proceeded to utterly DESTROY the person who had been leading, who ended the game with -19 points despite having bought over 20 containers on the island). The game which had been miserable for me and fun for him became miserable for him and upsetting for me (because I had been there and sympathized). With the rules of the game being what they are, this is the winning strategy, and there's no defense against it, and the game is a miserable experience. I doubt I will ever play it in this form again.

Well everything is in the mark.
Likely I won't play this game ever even if I might be convinced once in a while...which won't happen since I own the game and won't bring it to my group of players.
I considered putting a "2" because I found all 5 games I played extremely annoying. In my opinion this game has one winning strategy and no choice possible.

The good side : I like the material even if the playing boards tend to curve.

Container is unique. Trying to get goods to go where I wanted them to go was so complicated to wrap my mind around. It reminds me of Imperial in that respect. Container is the kind of mind expanding game where you have to figure out a whole new way of looking at gaming or else you will just be moving pieces around on the board with no purpose. I'm always a fan of chaos, so it's enjoyable to experience a game with so little randomness that has so much chaos. 

The bits are cool as long as the boards aren't warped and the pieces aren't broken and as long as all of the pieces are painted the proper colors.

My rating will probably increase as I play it more times.

A pure supply/demand economic game which has the potential to be utterly ruined by the wrong group.  But I suspect that even breaking this game would be an educational and fun experience.

Great game.  There seems to be a lot of negative reviews of this one.  For one, the mechanics are quite different from most Euro games.  Investment in infrastructure must be slow at first.  Too much spending in the beginning will end your game quickly and harshly, with very little room to make a come back.  With this in mind, our game group had a lot of fun with this, and ended the game with a tight victory.

Container is an unique and interesting pure economics game. In fact, it is the a very distilled trading game. The rules are not complex and at the first glance seem to offer only little freedom to players: set prices for your own goods or purchase goods from other players. However, in this confined action space Container offers a lot of freedom and only very little constraints. Whereas in most Euro games each action has a certain effect and you know the outcome, setting prices in Container does not. You just do not know, what other players will pay for your goods.

Before each good is finally delivered to the island (where it counts as victory points), there are three stages of trading: sale from factory, sale from harbor and auction at the island. Each stage is unique: production has high fix costs with factories, but low variable costs; to supply goods at your harbor you have littel fix costs, but when setting the price you have to consider how much you paid to the producer; delivering the goods to the island has no fix costs, high variable costs, requires the most actions, and has an unknown return - but also the biggest return potential.

The economy is semi closed. By that I mean that players for the most part trade with each other (such that no money flows out from the economy), but there are a few mechanism where the amount of money in the economy changes: infrastructure investment is an outflow (also when you purchase goods from your own auction); at the island auctioners get twice the highest bid, whereas the doubling comes as an inflow from the bank. Typically for this closed economy, how one turn plays out depends on how much money is in the economy. Since the only inflow source (which can even turn into outflow if the auction offer is not accepted by the seller) is determined by auction, I believe the economy has potential to fail if players act foolishly.

I actually like this aspect. I have the impression that many modern Euros are very well designed, such that they are well balanced and is clearly defined how much points you do per action. This is not the case in Container. How much a good is worth pretty much depends on the conception of the players. I am really amazed how such a simple rule set creates such a complex game. 

I have only a few things to criticize, why Container is not one of my absolute top games. The gameplay is rather dry, which is also connected to the almost non-existent theme. In general I do not have any problem with a dry economic theme, but in Container the mechanisms are also not well thematically integrated: Why can you not buy from yourself; why is the auction offer doubled by the bank; why do containers magically fly from other players factories to your harbor; why do you want to get the containers to this island at all? (I know, without these mechanisms the game would simply not work.) While I like the ships and I am only little underwhelmed by the design of the factory  board, I do not like the color palette chosen for the game. Two of the ships are nearly indistinguishable; two of the container colors are also not too easy to separate. Last and certainly least: the graphic design of the island is simply abysmal.

RATING: 7.2
Quite an involved game. Many heart-breaking decisions. You are attempting to indirectly influence the play to get an advantage. High level of randomness/control-lessness, where you need to get your containers on the market by producing, selling and/or loading the cargo you need be delivered to your portion of the island. As a downside, the boats are well done but the colors are aweful, to a point where players got confused as to which one was theirs!?

Some parts of the game seem needlessly complicated while others are too simplified. That might sound like a contradiction, but I think you'd have to play the game to see what I mean.

this is a game which is either REALLY good OR a random game masquerading like a good one - i have played once and lost but feel the latter is true - ur game can b v randomly effected to the bad due to other players playing sub-optimally. most annoying to me is the scoring tho - it has the kinda hidden mission scoring i like BUT there are 5 colours and due to the overly balanced nature of scoring 3 of the colours r all efectivley worth the same thus making it a game of v small margins and subtlety - not a great problem perhaps but coupled with a blind bid auction it can feel v random

i will freely admit there might be a great game lurking in here after 10 odd plays and i wouldnt object to trying it again BUT i would happily never play it again

Clever tough weird economic game. We played 3 times in BGG.CON. I wish it worked for 2 players, not just 3-5. But very interesting and good. Auctions, price-setting, your best color doesn't count at the end ... neat tough choices.

PS: some people seem scared off from even trying Container, due to exaggerated warnings about how it has a "fragile economy" which new players will screw up and thus ruin the gameplay. In my experience, this warning is seriously exaggerated. I learned Container as a new player with other new players (including strangers) at a game con, literally with me reading the (quite short clear) rules aloud as we learned together, and our games went fine. So IMHO people should not let the "fragile economy, bad for new players, scary!" rhetoric mislead you into not trying Container if you get a chance.

Just too dry, too long, and too boring for me. I don't like that the best strategy is to focus solely on shipping, but if a majority of the table does this, the game shuts down from lack of goods. And unlike most medium-heavy Euros, you have very few options each turn to choose from. If you like this kind of game, I don't know why you wouldn't always choose to play Power Grid over this (which I don't particularly like but will agree to play again, unlike this one).

This game takes some attention- the first time we played, one of the players was out of her depth and the second time our economy tanked. Just about as dry as I'd ever like a game to be, but I still find it enjoyable. The hurdle to playing is having to reread all the rules critically.

Very interesting game, 2 plays and found the markets very tricky.  Never seen a Economy quite like it.  Work for a container shiping company for years and it is surprisingly accurate for such a simple game.  The concenseous on my group was good name but needed a wow moment to be great.  You do the same thing over in over.

Je ne sais pas si je me fais vieux, blasé, et aigri, mais j'ai l'impression que beaucoup des nouveautés, ces temps ci, se contentent se recycler de vieux mécanismes, en faisant des jeux qui doivent donner la meilleure impression possible avant et pendant la première partie, et qu'on range définitivement après la cinquième.

Dans un contexte pareil, Container fait figure d'un grand seau d'eau fraiche par une canicule de 35°C. Innovant, riche, interactif, ce jeu a tout pour lui, pour autant que les joueurs respectent la fluidité du jeu en mettant moins de 30 secondes à jouer leur coup…

Update 07-2008: finally I got to play my third game of Container. It’s the third game which, according to self-imposed law, means I will rate it too. I was thinking along the line of a five, maybe a six for Container, as the first two games didn’t really flow that well and it took me a long time to get it to the table the first three times. But after yesterday’s play I’m convinced there is a brain burner (but without too much AP) that can be a [b]good[/b] game to the able minded. As far as I can tell (from the way I’m lost in all three games) there is much to learn for me about Container, and how to improve play. That conclusion, and the fact that I really enjoyed yesterday’s game, I say it’s a solid seven for now.
Container is like a good vintage wine: it has to ripe before it gets good. You have to give the game a few go's before you start to appreciate the fine aspects of the game. It's very unforgiving, in that respect it could even pass Caylus.

RATING: 9.6
It's like the little world Lisa Simpson created in a petri dish. ("I've created Lutherans!")

I think it's great that Container sometimes stalls out ... so topical.

Read Farrell's comments below to see why any capitalistic system needs good regulation (or read the history of the Erie Railroad, whichever you prefer).

Anyway, Container is a great tub to be the Queen of.

And bring me some shoes. Nice ones !

RATING: 4
early mistakes mean that you might as well sit on your hands the rest of the game.  If you like to sit around performing calculations on relative values of actions and memorizing what each player was willing to pay for various containers this is the game for you... if that isn't what you like then avoid this one.

Played one 4P game and one 5P game so far. In my very first game with 4P, we agreed to concede the game early as it seemed impossible to catch up with the player in the lead. Halfway through the game, players had begun undercutting prices at the harbour and factory store. This led to us being caught in a death spiral as our buying power steadily decreased and there was no way to inject enough money into the closed system.

That experience made me realise that Container is the closest I've gotten to a free market simulation in a board game (barring a few rules which don't make sense in a real-world scenario, like the restrictions on buying your own goods). Players have to constantly identify and exploit niche links in the economy to earn healthy profits, and these profits are then used to win auctions for containers. To keep this entire economic machinery afloat requires competent and involved players.

Despite the brilliance behind its concept, I can't quite get behind the need to constantly crunch numbers and keep tabs on prices paid. Combine that with its long playing time (roughly 3hrs with 5P), and Container holds more interest for me as an economic simulation as opposed to an actual game.

This is a border-line great game.  Most of it is extremely intriguing.  It's an economic game at heart, and it's very well put together.  I'm not totally enthralled with all sealed bidding though.  I think it would be interesting to give the seller the option to choose the auction type. (sealed, open, once around).  Also, players can get less turns than the others if a player before them triggers the end game condition.  I think with a few minor tweaks this game may be outstanding (it's still very good as is).  I need to get some more plays in.

Wow.  I liked it, although it took me quite awhile to wrap my head around the scoring and play concepts, considering that the rules are actually quite simple.  I came in second in a five-player game without knowing what I was doing.  Apparently, money is much more important for scoring purposes as compared to most games.  It seems as if you can get about two-thirds of your scoring by money alone...  Nice pieces too -- unless you're color blind.It should be noted that the game is a bit long for some, and I'm not sure that it would play well with other than five players.

UPDATE: The game has a kingmaker aspect.  I bid too much on the last auction for my second game, arguably giving the victory to that player as he also receives the same amount of money from the bank.  The game is quite popular with the St. Louis Boardgames Meetup Group.

Perhaps the greatest game about smuggling contraband ever made.  Create confusing paper trails, laundering everyone else's unmarked crates around.  You can't just produce goods and ship them to the island you have to elaborately lose the tail in order to get it to Mauritius.  

Notable mostly in just how unlike other economic games this feels. The majority of the game is groupthink, yet it isn't a stock game.  Everything you do is completely dependent on your fellow players, but the addition of this volatile nature to the game adds a real feeling of a supply/demand scenario.  Those that can't handle being at the mercy of other players should avoid this.

I felt caught up in the number of wonderful tough little decisions in a turn. Often though, I was just trying to figure out how to get past spinning my wheels.  Nicely interactive as you are dependent on others to get anywhere.  There's lots of money exchanging hands, so those that can't give anything away will have a hard time.

My rating will probably go up with more plays.

Great bits and art, despite the awkward center island.

UPDATE:It is still quite good with 5, but it becomes overly long.  Best to play this with 4.

Container has arrived!!!

Rated after first play - Flow of the game really depends upon group think as far as pricing for the various cargos goes.  We had 3 out of 4 of us who were trying to do everything - produce, sell and deliver goods, so there was a lot of difficulty in making any money in producing or selling.  The one person who tried to hold out with higher prices ended up losing several turns of actions because he refused to lower his good's prices to match the rest of us and no one was willing to pay his even slightly higher prices because the market was awash with cheap goods.  Still a lot of tense fun.

Valley Games, in my opinion, needs to place more emphasis on usability. Their design of the Die Macher cards causes confusion. And here, with Container, their color choices were atrocious: the orange and brown containers are too close; the light blue and lighter blue ships are too close; the playing mat colors don't match the ship colors; and a black container on the black ship is invisible.

That said, this is a superb game. We played 4-player last night and everyone loved it. There are many dynamic choices to be made through the game. I see this being played a lot.

Great design, somewhat flawed production. (The cargo ships are cool, though.)

Follow-up: newbies at this game insist on building up their factories and warehouse before starting to ship goods. It deflates the economics and takes a lot of the fun out of the game for me. And some people don't set their prices in the right ball park, or bid way too low or too high, which also saps at the game, in my view.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
[b]Way[/b] overrated, in my book.  There is a "right" way to play this, and you need regular shipments of  goods to the island with good bidding to keep money into the economy.  Games that require a very specific way to play are broken in my book.  I'd give this a 1, except that I'm curious to play it one more time to see if there's something in it that I'm missing.

The first time I played I was completely cut out of contention by not focusing on a niche. I finished dead last. The second time, having learned the basics, I made a lot of my money shipping, enough to hand me the win. The third time I finished in the middle of the pack. That third play was interesting, as price fixing and collusion lead to inflation.  This created an economic slump from which it took some time for everyone to recover. I wouldn't call it a depression, but it definitely slowed the game down.  As you might expect, the wealthiest player weathered the storm most effectively.

Container is opaque.  It is not easy to understand the full effects of your actions.  It is also very player-determined.  The economy can crash if the players cause it to.  More interesting than fun, it is a game I remain curious to better understand.

One huuuuge flaw this has is the same problem that Modern Art has.  You can figure out what a shipment is worth to you in an auction.  Some players didn't want to bother and just wanted to win the auction, so what they did was bid far too much for a load of containers.  That is then doubled, and person who was the lucky recipient just shot way ahead.   The same thing happens in Modern Art - if you are playing with folks who don't realize that it's a game of splitting profits (and not making tiny profits on the sale), it throws the results into the wind.

I also found the game to be very plodding in flow.  It takes so long for containers to trickle from factories out to the island that things seemed to take a very long time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A weird game of supply and demand where you produce containers that only OTHER players may buy. When you buy from other players, they go into your Harbor Warehouse, where only OTHER players may buy them (loading their ships). When a ship sails to Foreign Island, it auctions the lot of containers. 

Initial game with 3 was OK, but 2nd play (with 5) was better if too long: more containers in the market, more competition and price-adjustment, more options since actions weren't as limited by what was available in only 2 player's boards. However, the game feels a bit repetitive: only 4 options each turn, without enough other stuff happening to keep it from getting really interesting. Not bad, but not great, either. Next time, would play with fewer containers.

Played with four and it went a little too long.  I think it would work better if at least five pieces of each color are discarded, maybe even as many as ten.  Still, it's a solid economic game where you have to be more careful with your money than I originally anticipated.  Watching your profit margins and maximizing your return per turn is tricky yet crucial.  It's interesting to decide how much to bid in the auctions and some of the early decisions are quite important, such as how many production centers to build and when.  I'm curious to see if my rating will increase to an eight upon further playing (I can't see it going higher than that) or if the actions will become a bit too repetitive.

Of the three new games I played in June Container is the most probably game to get more play in the future, if I were to decide. I really like the price setting mechanism i combination with pretty simple rules. My mother, who is 65 years old, played it with me, my girlfriend and my sister and was magnificent in pricing her goods. She won the first game without competition. In the second game she became a little boycotted with surely shows containers biggest weakness: you cant play the game good and aspect to win if the other players are inclined to se you as the biggest threat. In our gamecircle that is mostly me so I will have a hard time winning this gem (game).
Other complains? The components color and the ship-material. Both this aspect are, as other geeks written things that could be greatly improved.

Some clever mechanisms, colours on the board and materials are not very clear.

It could be fun with the right group of players but it depends too much on that. It drags a lot on the end. It should take less than 90 minutes to play but takes about 2 - 2,5 hours instead!

The main problem of Container though is how players know how much a shipment can worth thus making the game too much programed and unisteresting.

Impressively simple, yet complicated to play well. The game system is very minimalistic and leaves the players with a maximum of freedom to do what they want. 

Most euros tend to be optimization puzzles where players try to manipulate the system to their advantage. Not so Container, where it's just you, your fellow players and some rules-based constraints. Not everyone handles that well, so for many people, this comes across as a strange game. 

I liked it and was even more impressed by it. I've got the feeling I've only scratched the surface. But the fact that enjoying the game is so dependent on the players makes this game very vulnerable to breaking down and hence disappointing experiences. Therefore, only an 8 for now, but this may yet rise.

Nice streamlined design where the action are simple and the turns relatively fast, with some interesting depth. Everybody needs to be conscious that this is not an engine building game (so over building is possible) and the only way new money comes into the game is when selling to the foreign island.

I think the game suffer (or benefit according to your point of view) from a meta game where everybody needs to be aware of everybody else situation and form blockade/boycott at the appropriate moment.  Without this level of awareness, the game suffer form a rich gets richer problem.

It's a great design, but I'm not too compelled to play again.

RATING: 7.5
Difficult, [i]almost[/i] self-contained economic game. Money only leaves the system when players buy factories (produce containers) and warehouses (store containers produced by other players and purchased); it only enters the system when those goods (bought from another player's warehouse and shipped to the island) are auctioned off. The winning bid is matched by the bank.

I've heard horror stories about breaking the game by leeching too much money out of it; we might have ruined it in the opposite direction by allowing windfall profits (on the order of 300-400%) for island shipping. 

The whole thing reminds me of Chicago Express in that winning seems to be largely about incentive management and correctly estimating values to different players in order to do so. Because shipping takes so many separate stages (and vertical integration is illegal) it's impossible to go it alone -- you've got to get other players doing your dirty work. That said, actually estimating values correctly seems extraordinarily difficult due to the hidden prices for each player: I have no idea how to play well. In future I would like to play with open money to remove some of the guesswork.

In true Valley Games style, components are pretty awful. Actually, the money is OK and the resin ship pieces are nice and solid, only the colours don't match. I don't know what moron thought it was a good idea to have three of the commodities coloured in orange and two shades of brown, and I was shocked that the dreadful, washed-out artwork came from the usually good value Mike Doyle. None of this stuff is game-breaking, except in low light, but it does help in making the game feel even more dry and unpleasant.

A very interesting game.

This game is slightly confusing at first.  On your first game you kind of have to feel your way through it.  But after a little play it starts to make sense and is quite fun.  I like how you don't really know how well people are doing until the very end.  I also like how the game moves along at a quick pace.  There is virtually no down time as people take their turn.  Overall a very fun game that is deep without being overly complicated.  I would like to play this one some more.

Origins was a pretty good experience for me in 2010; I had a chance to play a number of games for the first time. I spent almost all my time in the Board Room, which I can't recommend strongly enough to anyone who comes to Origins.

I played Container with three other guys who had never played it.

The mechanics of play were easy enough to grasp. I suspect there is some deep strategy underlying pricing your goods to manipulate the types of containers that end up shipped to the island, but to be honest I didn't grasp what it might be; I just priced my stuff "medium low" and the other players seemed willing enough to buy and ship my goods.

For shipping to the island and bidding on cargoes, I unintentionally stumbled onto the tactic of loading my ships with a combination of containers that would work well for myself, then landing on the island when the other players were low on cash. The resulting bids were low and I could then buy my own cargo cheap. I had no trouble ensuring that I had the most containers of my "cheap" type (thereby not counting them in the end) and getting a fairly large number of my first- and second-highest types. I ended up winning the game comfortably.

Play again? Yes, definitely. Because I am sure there is depth to this game that I just didn't pick up on in one play against equally-inexperienced opponents. I'll be blunt: I almost always lose complex games, so I was surprised that I came out on top. I want to play Container again so I can tell whether the win was actually good play or just dumb luck.

RATING: 7
[Valley Game 07 edition w/ plastic containers] {Shipping, economic; pick-up-delivery, blind-bidding, secret-goal; optimal 4p}  I usually like Franz-Benno Delonge's games.  They are usually thematic, interactive and medium-weight, which are very suitable for my friends.  Therefore, I decided to pre-order a copy of Container from Valley Games.

At first, I pre-order Container before the rule is published.  I thought it was a family game similar to other Franz-Denno's designs.  However, I was completely wrong.  Container is a unique game in my collection, in which the game situation is very opaque.  Inexperienced players cannot really understand what is happening; thus, they are vulnerable to be isolated. I witness cases that a player is held hopeless with no money inflow.

Container is a thematic medium-weight game, in which players indirectly trade between each other.  It is essentially a tactical game but the secret goal provides a very good strategic base.  The game progresses well (though a little bit slow) with a group of experienced players.  Decisions are meaningful in Container and sometimes players would like to do many things in a turn than allowed.  It needs a few games to understand the flow and potential of Container.

There are a few minuses.  Container may be quite processional for some players, in which player keep offering, buying and sailing.  Another problem is that Container may break if some players made a mistake or don't even know how to offer - then it may benefit another player too much that the fellow players cannot even match.  In addition, there are too many rule tweaks for my taste, which makes the system quite artificial (without a good integration with the theme).  (Players are complaining Container is fragile but I think it's more a problem of the players.)

I really don't like Mike Doyle's art style. The color tune is just too dark and saturated. It's very tried to look at them.  I don't know why current publisher still chooses brown and orange color together for the bits. It is so difficult to distinguish them.  The colors of ships are too close, too!

Umm, the pre-order experience is not good. Essen participants got the game earlier (why bother pre-ordering with such high shipping price).  Little communication and plastic containers are not delivered as promise. I won't consider pre-orders at Valley Games again.

This is a very cool game. The way money moves amongst the players and in/out of the game is fascinating. So many options as to how to price your own goods and what to pay for others. A few odd things thematically, but overall a fantastic (and good looking) game.

One play, so I wont rate this. if I had too I'd say there is definately a game in here,  but it's pretty obtuse.  I'd like to try it again.

I mean it's possible to totally destroy someone, that "uncle" rule seems to be a very good idea for the first few games.

Realistic economic model. You are actually very much dependent on what the other players need.
Don't set up a business when nobody wants your products.
Some players don't like this aspect, though. They probaly like games where you are assured to be able to sell anything you produce.
This game reminds me a little bit of Executive Decision (3M), but this time the economic model is better.

A harsh supply & demand economy with no help from the game to protect you from your errors. Simple choices, yet you need to read the rhythm of the game and operate symbiotically to other players otherwise you're almost frozen out.

Despite criticisms elsewhere, I actually like the slightly washed-out artwork, and I'm glad I got the standard wooden containers rather than the miscoloured bonus versions.

This is a 3 to me because I don't like the game.  It feels a lot like work and really isn't much fun in my opinion.  I think the game breaks when someone decides to play the cheap game because everyone else either does the same or doesn't sell anything. 

That said, I appreciate a lot of what this game does.  It's pretty neat how you have to go around in circles to get the goods you want.  That's certainly innovative. 

Ultimately, I won't play this again.  I really despised it.

tentative rating. System is well thought out and clean. Quite a long time to finish (at least 3 hours) for what is somewhat repetitive. Fills a niche of a true economic game for 6+ players IIRC. update: Continues to impress me after about 8-10 plays. We have found house rules to get this game down to about 1 1/2 hours for four, I am picky w/ regard to game times, so this important for me. Rating based on streamlined house rules, would be an 8 with the official rules.

Very good, streamlined design. Fast turns. I have increased my score to 9 since the game was released (it was 7.5 after the first playings of the prototype), I love it! Could end up being a 10 after a few more plays!

If you're not convinced of this game after your first play, I urge you to try it again with players who have played it before. It just gets so much better after each play, as people start seeing the different ways to advance to victory. Make sure to ship to the island often (not always with full ships) as it brings money in to the game, which is essential!

So, by now everyone realises this is the dryest economic game around, right? Well, Valley Games made an excellent production decision in adding in some beautiful (if seemingly a little fragile) ships. They're handled frequently and look and feel wonderful. The colour choices are a little more questionable, especially for the goods themselves.

As for the game, it does feel as though it runs a little long and in our play people were entirely unwilling to allow distributors to make more than 1 profit per item so our economy never really took off, with everyone constantly undercutting any attempt at raising prices. It felt a little as though any attempt to vary that would fail - perhaps because of the people at the table - and that was a shame. We also had 1 player who just didn't get in to the game and any imbalances in player skill or interest can tilt the game badly in one direction or another. So, in summary; fragile, a little long but interesting.

RATING: 9
A simple free market game: produce, distribute, and sell. Within this simplicity, market psychology has free reign. Seems like an excellent basis for modification to teach basic Economics. Oh, and a really fun game! Even better than economic games that simulate market forces (cough, cough, Brass, Power Grid), Container actually has market forces. Modern Art on steroids, with much less chance of auctions getting out of hand.

I say simple. Some people, even economically sophisticated people, don't seem to "get" Container. How one can spend one's life in a capitalist country and not understand free markets I have trouble understanding. I don't always play the game well, but I don't feel lost in it.

[u]Basic Container economics:[/u]
* Building factories drains money to the bank.
* Building warehouses drains money to the bank.
* Buying product shifts money among the players.
* Auctions feed money into the selling player if he doesn't buy his own goods (because of the bank matching funds).

This game is [b]not[/b] about each person building the best economic engine! Container is about each person finding the best niche in a single economic engine and shaving money and points from that [b]one[/b] economy better than the other players.

RATING: 10
A great economic game no doubt, perhaps the greatest purely economic game. 'Container' not only offers wonderful decisions in terms of what to produce, how much to produce, how much to store, and what to buy--but also demands that players pay absolute attention to other players' decisions as they unfold, i.e. this game is highly meta-cognitive.  To this effect, it is better in my opinion to play 'Container' with open money.

Friends of mine who are economists tell me that 'Container' does a pretty good job of modeling authentic decisions that have to be made in the world of international business. Which is to say, 'Container' can be unforgiving. It is possible in this game to more or less wreck the economy for everyone.  Learning how to evaluate what other people think something is worth can be tricky. 

But to me, just as with other games that reward multiple plays, this is a plus, not a detraction.

I wonder what will happen when the "I can't wrap my head around how to control things" feeling wears off. I think most of the interest in playing the game again was expressed with a desire for more time to figure out the puzzle. Since I can't do anything with my own items, I need to figure out how to get the goods I want to the island without cutting out all my profits along the way. After our players figure that out, will there be another layer of game past that or will interest just disappear?

NOTE: you must play with players that can see thing even when they don't jump up and hit them in the face. No, actions aren't worth $0 even though you get 2 free every turn. Saving $1 by spending two actions to move and buy a crate that's cheaper, IMO, isn't saving you anything.

RATING: 8
I've played Container twice. My tentative rating is very positive, but I have no idea if it's accurate. All I really know for sure is that I had a good time. I don't know why. I don't really know what happened. Goods were moving all over the place. I was trying to price them aggressively and fill up my island region. In my first game, I forgot the rule about disregarding your most plentiful good on the island -- and so I lost terribly.

All that said, this is a game for me. You have to pay attention to the other players, price things appropriately -- either up-selling or undercutting. You have to try to encourage the other players to do things that will bring value to your own portfolio. It's a mess, but it's fascinating.

What I love about Container is that the economy is entirely player-drivin. Yet unlike so many games that have player-driven economies, there is a fragility that feels as though the training wheels are off. Complaints about the game grinding to a halt are overblown. So long as everyone understands the consequences of pricing, there is no reason to assume that Container is, for example, "only for serious players." Instead, I feel as though the game includes a built-in sense of exhilaration. Perceiving that the game economy could fall apart, and that everything is under your control, is a bit like driving your car too fast: dangerous but exciting. Don't get me wrong, Container is no sports car, but at the same time it doesn't care if you spin out after hitting the accelerator too hard.

RATING: 6.5
Container is a pure economic game. Player A produces goods and sells them to Player B. Player B then sells those goods to Player C (or back to Player A). Player C then auctions those goods to the highest bidder (possibly including himself). The seller always gets to set the price, so there is a very organic free market economy system. Unfortunately in my one play the market was always pretty fixed, so that feature didn't really get to shine. The goods are worth variable amounts to each player, but the scoring system is set up so the differences aren't that extreme.

It's not a bad euro. I don't know if the purely economic game play would be enough to keep my attention for long, but I lost badly the first time so I'd like to play it again now that I understand the strategies better.

Must-have for economic simulation junkies. It's a different game every time, hinging on key decisions (or whims) in the early game that have far-reaching effects on the economy toward the end of the game. If you are paying attention to what others are doing, and time your price cuts or hikes right, you get the sense that you are not only participating in the economy, but driving it. Great fun.

I really didn't like this game - I think it must have been us (because it has a loyal fan base on Geek) but we just didn't get it. To the extent that I never want to play it again to find out. 
It was boring, filled with illogical game rules, andthe dynamic didn't work for us. We all ended up having to sell too cheap to cut-throat the opposition and then just not having enough coin to buy what you want. Car-boot sale on bad acid.
Definitely not a fan..!

Container has great bits and I really wanted to like this one. Sadly, it's bad. Success depends not on your own actions but on those of others, and goods offered by one player can be bypassed even by others they would benefit. Besides that, the game, for all it's wonderful bits, is deathly dull.

I am not really sure where this game is going. It might go up but it might also go down in my rating. I am definitely willing to give it a chance. The problems:

- Start player disadvantage (in the first round of play no player bought any goods from the industrial area of another player in order to place them in their own harbor area, thus in the second round the start player had no chance of docking his ship anywhere to pick up goods. 
- Fall behind loser-problem - when you screwed up early during the game you're out of the rest of the game. No matter what you'll do there is no chance to take influence in a way that would give you a chance to come back into the game. Personally I detest floating through the remaining 2 hours of a game knowing that. 
- Game length is way above the 60-90 minutes (it's rather 3 to 3 1/2 hours) 
- Investing in machines seems rather unprofitable
- It seems most of the time you don't find a market full of lucrative deals but you rather have to buy from the player to your right (because he or she has just produced and goods have not been bought so far) 

What I liked about the game was its dual entrepreneurship you have to think yourself into. On one side you are the industrialist trying to sell your goods, on the other hand you are a shipping company or rather the port supervisor trying to get the goods on their way. The scoring system balances itself nicely. By removing the kind of goods you collected the most from you need to also get stuff you don't need at all. 

To sum it up:

If all of the above Cons turn out to be mistakes of the game rather than mistakes of the players rating will go down. In the other case it'll move up

Rated an 8 after my first two plays. It's likely to go up if I keep liking it as I play more. What I like about it so far is the way players have to react well to what others are doing. It takes at least one game to get to that point, however--and I'm sure I'll keep discovering more things to consider. 

In my second play, I focused mostly on pick-up-and-deliver to make my money because everybody was producing in such abundance. It worked, I hardly produced at all and still had money to be competitive. Whereas in the first game I played, if I had tried the same strategy, I would have had very little money.

The game creates a sort of co-dependency for all players to make money, and spend money for the economic cycle to continue. And there's no other game I have that simulates that sort of economic fragility so well as this. For that, I'll probably keep it in my collection forever.

A true gem for any economic gamer.

Many people find this game to be unbalanced, and become frustrated with the lengthy gameplay and the apparent superiority (and potential kingmaking) of the shipping strategy.

As JC has noted elsewhere, building a stronger understanding as a group of the relative value of each step of the process can help mitigate the groupthink and balance the table.  We've found that AP prone players (like myself) can really bog this down if they try to calculate every possible move and the exact value of every action (and auction) for themselves.

Our current solution?  Speed Container.  We've taken to playing with a 20-second timer for all moves.  It makes the game fast, fluid, and fun.  I'm not sure clearclaw would approve, but it solves our immediate issue with the length and pace of the game.  

Another game that needs the 20-second timer treatment?  [gameid=47].

RATING: 7
What an odd game! It's a standard theme of players producing and shipping goods on boats, but the quirk is that you can't just ship the goods that you produce. You need other players to voluntarily choose to purchase and process the goods first, and then you can't ship the goods that you've purchased and processed. So the entire game is extremely interactive as it revolves around passing these goods back-and-forth as you essentially work together to get them from production to shipping. What I liked about Container is that it allowed players to specialize, really and truly specialize. Unlike many games that give the appearance of allowing specialization, while rewarding and encouraging a broad approach (e.g., Agricola, Endeavor), Container not only permitted but also didn't attempt to dissuade players from specializing in a particular facet of the supply chain, whether that be producing, processing, or shipping goods. What I didn't like about Container is that it seemed like a very fragile system that could cease to function relatively easily if the players didn't play "correctly" to make it work. It seems as if the game could easily break if the players don't essentially work together to keep the system running smoothly. It's definitely a game I would need to play a few more times to better grasp how it all fits together.

[thing=26990][/thing] is a game great game, but one I will usually avoid play with someone that hasn't played it before. This happens because the blind bidding for goods can make a game end basically in one round. If someone overbid by too much, the player will get not only this amount, but also twice as much, since the bank always pays the same amount for the player.

Also, the market is determined by the players. This can be really enjoyable, but if one or more players want to "game" it, they will be able. This could mean almost breaking the game: if the amount payed for goods in the island isn't worth the trouble to send ships and buy them, the game can come into a halt - no one wants to lower the prices, and no one wants to buy them.

[thing=26990][/thing] is a player-dependant game. This means both a good thing and a dangerous thing.

Pretty brilliant and elegant/slick design. The fun factor of the gameplay [i]maybe[/i] lags a bit behind the quality of the design but I'm not sure yet.

Basically, players produce containers (wooden bits), and want to finish the game owning a collection of containers that maximizes their personal (and secret) scoring equation, which is slightly convoluted. (The five colors of containers are valued differently by each player, with a possible bonus for having at least one of each color, and with a Knizian twist of having to trash the color you have the most of.) However, a container must be sold three times between production and scoring, and you can't sell to yourself.

Every time you buy something, your inclination is probably to resell it at a higher price. But clearly there's a limit to what that price can be. That, I would expect, would put it in the extortion/haggling category of games that I don't really like. However, Container's rules never call for negotiation. You set your prices and people take it or leave it (you can adjust later if you want). The third sale is a blind bid auction, and if the seller doesn't like any offers he can buy his own stuff (which can be devastating as the bank matches funds in the auction if you sell to someone aside from yourself).

A given turn can be blazingly fast. You only get two actions and aside from the auctions they are all very simple. At first I thought this was too insubstantial and I couldn't keep a train of thought. I also wondered, at first, where the game could possibly be, as it seemed like players were just acting out an economic simulation with few strategic choices. I still have some doubts about this, but gradually I did start to realize that different approaches were possible, and that the auctions needed to be carefully considered, in regard to how valuable an offer is to each player, whether you want to be the one selling something, and whether the players you hope to sell to will even have any money at the time.

This is how games should be: few simple rules but a lot of depth. A pure economical game where you are not playing the game but only the other players. Complexity arises from that and not the mechanisms of the game. Fantastic!

Bought at Essen 2007. Lots of excitement at the stand as the games arrived with Miss Canada looking on. 

I wasn't really prepared to invest time in learning how to play a game where you have to treat it in a particular way in order to get it to "work". Not far off my definition of a "broken" game. Sadly.

Perhaps the most open gaming platform in the Euro field, the players create the game using simple rules to raise a common economy with interdependencies that takes a patient stance to exploit. The use of hidden information - each player has hidden, differing values for each color container circulating the economy - adds a layer of deduction that gives it the potential of bluff & a surprise reveal.

I've had good & bad plays & I've become ambivalent on whether to play. It's player-driven genes can birth an odd duck here & there, but it's not just that. More that I may project onto it more than it is. Or it may be it good play can be reduced to a rule of thumb set of tactics driven by calculation that exposes, but doesn't accommodate, the irrationality that drives economies.

Nice bits, interesting game. Players can adopt different strategies for winning, sometimes just selling goods for $$ is better than bidding too much to get the best lot of goods on the island! We play quite a bit of this and always have fun with it. The economy doesn't seem to make a lot of sense, yet the game is playable and it works. Convincing other players to buy commodities from you when others of the same are available elsewhere, sometimes for less, is one flaw in the game. Losing the value of the largest commodity you own on the island is another ill conceived rule of the game.

Looking forward to the expansion coming out soon.

Initial Impression; limited plays. 

Our first game, we sucked too much money out of the system.  Two out of the three of us were well on our way to going broke and losing the containers we had delivered to the island (two loans, no good way to raise money), the other person could have worked to prolong the game and successfully bankrupt us, but they weren't really enjoying the game either.

Surprisingly easy if not a bit unintuitive.  This is a dream-economy game to me in a way, it's not about number crunching, it's much more tactical, reacting to other player's turns, and going with your gut as you try to react to the ever changing supply and demand and intuit what others are going to be after on their turn.

Is there a "right" way to play this?

I don't know, but what I know for sure is, we took the "wrong" one then. Bidding minimum prices for the goods and therefor forcing players to buy the goods themselves results in money leaving the game instead of money entering it.

I know people who defend this as a "fault by the players" and maybe it's our fault to play "wrong", so there maybe a good game somewhere in here - this is why I don't rate it a "1" for broken.
If you don't see the good game in there (as I do) read this as a "1"...

RATING: 10
Easily my favorite game - it's a shame that I realized this too late to buy it for cheaper.

Of the handful of games I've played, no game does a better job simulating real-world microeconomic and macroeconomic principles with such simple mechanics. Business owners in small, primarily closed economies must support one another, and there must be very little selfish, cutthroat activity. As the economy grows, companies have increased cash flow, and you can afford occasional cutthroat or selfish acts.

Similarly, the earliest turns in Container should be quite civil and friendly. Once more money has been added to the economy, players can begin to act more out of self-interest. (Of course, none of this applies if you're content with a game (economy) where everyone is strapped for cash and has to take out multiple loans. But I prefer games (economies) where debt is minimal and cash flow is strong!)

In your earliest turns in Container, I've found it key to do two things:

1. Don't go too crazy buying additional machines and warehouses (this causes money to exit the closed economy, and you can quickly halve the amount of cash in play)
2. In the earlier auctions, if you actually want a shipment, bid what you think it's worth. Don't lowball. If I'm interested, I typically start with a bid of $2.00-3.00 per container, understanding that the seller paid at least $2 per container to load up the ship. The results of these auctions will set the trajectory for the game's economy for the rest of the game.

The rules regarding scoring island containers are genius, and make for some very surprising results. Very little luck is included in this game, but these rules produce a level of unpredictability that keep everyone interested throughout the entire game.

I'm beginning to wonder if I just hate pure economic games.  Of the few I've tried, none have sat particularly well with me.  This one wasn't the one to change my mind.  I think we invested too much in factories and warehouses at first, which meant that capital dried up in the beginning, which meant that the game stagnated early and lumbered along like a member of the living dead until we finally managed to get over it about an hour and a half into the game.  This is probably somebody's cup of tea, but that somebody is not me.

Container really demands repeated plays to get the most enjoyment out of the game's subtle and somewhat fragile mechanics. It reminds me of Modern Art in many ways, and I think whoever likes that game will probably like Container as well. Exquisitely sensitive to groupthink. Markets can never be cornered permanently, so the key to profit is being "in the right place at the right time", having the most desirable service (whether it be factory, warehouse, or boat goods) at a particular moment. The game is basically an iteration of this theme.

RATING: 9
Pure economics, no luck at all(...I guess there is a VERY little bit).  There are two interesting bits to this game.  First is that players aren't able to specialize, they'll need to participate in all parts of the economy to make money.  Second is that the game can be 'broken' if players play poorly.

I've played the game with all 5 players, and 4 of them being new and we didn't 'break' the game so I imagine that this is very hard to do.

Seems that the most money is made selling goods at auction though, and that the rest of the game is just making sure there are enough goods to sell them.

RATING: 9
The last time I played a game that wowed me right off the bat, it was Wabash Cannonball.  Container follows in those footsteps, and it's not a coincidence that the games are both made up of a closed economic system, with extra money only coming in to the games at determined times.  It's also no coincidence that the games are both perfect information games (well, with Container, it's near-perfect, since no one is ever entirely sure which containers the other players are hoping to score), and that the way the game plays out is entirely dependent on the choices that players make during the game.  Like Wabash Cannonball, Container is also a relatively short game for its depth.  It has a delicate (or fragile, depending on how you look at it) economic system which is prone to "breaking" when players don't understand the consequences of overbidding, but the same can be said of Modern Art, and besides, in both games, it's more a characteristic of the game to manage, not a problem with the system itself.  In addition, all of the games I've played of Container played out VERY differently, which impresses me, as well.  In short, I really enjoyed this game, and I can see myself wanting to play it often.

Good game; will take longer than the advertised box time, especially on the first few plays. Moves fairly smoothly, and each choice is a hard one. Will take a few plays to get a grip on how this game works: you have very little direct control over gathering income, but more direct control over investing your income; as such, you will find directing the flow of your game difficult because it's not at first clear where the cost/benefit points are nor how to regulate your income/expenses properly. Also, it appears to be one of those games where it's relatively important to have everyone at the table have a roughly similar level of experience with the game: newbies, expect to get crushed by those teaching you for a game or two. (Also, keep a very close eye on the ending conditions for the game; it can sneak up on you very quickly.)

This a fascinating, albeit somewhat fragile game design. It's not a philosophical frailty like Archipelago where players can tank the game, but rather a skill cap frailty. In other words, if everyone at the table isn't playing at a near exact skill level, the game can get chaotic in a hurry. The game runs on a closed economy, so over-development or bad investments by one player can have serious consequences for everyone else at the table. In many ways, that is just another unique and challenging environment to play around in and that's fine. It's the exact sort of thing you look for in a sandbox game like Container.

The problem is mainly in the auction phase, as this is the primary way that new money enters the game. If someone at the table is baffled by the game's economics or they start to frequently overvalue shipments, the game can quickly go off the rails with either king-making money swaps or completely random explosions of profit. Both are somewhat unsatisfying outcomes and the threat of their occurrence stops me from rating this one too high.

In a solid group, where everyone understands the repercussions of their actions however, the game absolutely shines. It is astounding how much depth there is in such an easy rule set. This is an extremely meaty game, but the rules can easily be condensed down into a page and a half. The other thing I like about it is that while skilled play is important, competence never seems to lead to predictability. There are simply too many layers in the supply chain for most people to calculate exact profits. Some folks will be able to do so, of course. They will be tough to beat. Still, this is a game that rewards skill, so that is to be both expected and celebrated.

Just make sure everyone levels up their play at the same pace and you won't have problem. It's shame this out of print, because I think it belongs on the shelf of every serious heavy gamer.

There's a lot to like about this one - it's very close to being one of my favorite games. The biggest thing is the blind bidding - I strongly dislike blind bidding in basically all situations, and here especially given that it's essentially the only way new money comes into the game, it's too much for me.

Having said that, I do like the way the supply/demand mechanics work, and how interactive the game is without being directly confrontational.

Also, the game is better if you refer to containers by food instead of color (we use pumpkin, marshmellow, chocolate, graham cracker and licorice).

My only play has been quite satisfying, although maybe a bit long (the last few turns felt a bit repetitive, although the feeling might have disappeared if we had played quicker earlier - it was a learning game for most of us). Evaluating the value of the containers at different stages seems difficult at first, but quite often several of us had the same value as our first offer in the auctions. A possible problem is that the game might be quite fragile if players go wrong early.

Fantastic economic game.  I've enjoyed it every time, despite the fact that I'm yet to actually win.   0-5 now, and dead last for three of those.  Grrr... must win at least once.

This has been a tough one to get to the table because it needs at least three players (four or five is better) and the theme is very dry.


The plastic ships are really cool, although the color selections for the containers could have been a little better.

Very different economic system to anything else I've played. Hard to initially comprehend what's really going on, though enjoyable despite this.

Purchased Essen 2007.

This certainly surprised me by its playability. It's going to take a few play-throughs to figure out how to correctly buy and ship containers, but I'm looking forward to that!

Three plays while testing it. I like the game as I tend to like economic games. The method of producing goods and requiring someone else to buy them is hard to wrap my brain about, but I think it works well.

I enjoy Container.  It one of those in my collection that is doomed to spend a lot of time on the shelf because other folks(Donnnnie) doesn't like it.

It did go over very well in Erie, with all 5 players having a good time.  The constant sexual innuendo helped a bit.

Dan, Corey and Shawna likes this as well, so it's a keeper again.

I really love this game. Seeing what has happened to the price I am so glad Scott N. showed me this on his presumably one play so I could get an early copy. I've only played a handful of times, but I love every play.
---------------------
New high score last game with $195. Most games have more stingy bidding, but this last game I ran without any infrastructure and just shipped all game, and bidding was a bit higher. Lowest score was ~$120, which is usually a competitive score.

interesting economic engine.  it's a little disorienting to grasp how to actually get the containers into your island area.  you can't buy them, and containers you buy are good only for generating cash from other players getting containers into their area.  strange, but pretty good.  oh, and never ever bid all your money when you have two loans.  very bad.

Component quality is good. Player interaction is high. Rather interesting economic game where one has to watch for what other players require.

This is a gem of economic & resource management game. I seriously feel that this game has fallen into some cracks as it is over shadowed by "Agricola". However, i believe that through time, this game will prevail.

Game play wise it is a breather from the usual game genre. It take a little hard on the thinking part as to grasp the basic fundamentals of buy at cheaper price and sell at higher price as well as demand and supply.

However there is a loop hole that we are unsure  when the active player sends its cargo to the island and quickly takes a loan before the active player calls out an auction. i wish to get some answers on that. 

Overall, it is a beautiful game. worth the purchase! 

the look and feel is excellent but the products quality is poor especially the warehouse and the ships.

Its a gamey lesson in economics!  I read that it is fun to watch the money "slosh around" in this one and that certainly is how this feels to play.  The rules seem relatively simple but it take a bit of actual playing to see how to make money.  The only negative for me is the blind bid auction but with experience its easier to figure out a good amount to bid (and like other auction games this can be broken by someone making screwy bids).  Container has just gotten better and better for me with more plays (even the broken ones) and it is not only my favorite economic game... but one of my favorite games period.

The game is painfully dry and plays awfully long.  I had to take out a loan to be able to finally end it because none of the other players would.  I imagine my negative experience had a lot more to do with the people I was with rather than the design itself, since pretty much every decision hinged upon what others did (the producing of good, the pricing of products and the bidding for containers).  The biggest failing for container is this: my enjoyment and appreciation of a game should be independent of the company I keep.  In fact, a great title could be made better by good players but should not otherwise suffer because the lack of them.

Not sure how I feel about this one just yet, so it gets my standard rating of "games I generally like" which is 8.  I do definitely want to get it to the table more often.  Shame my boards are all slightly warped, and on top of that I don't have enough white containers.

Generic euro.  Producing and picking up containers is kind of counterintuitive in the way they use opponents' resources.  And two of the set of player pieces are virtually identical in color.  The first word to spring to mind when considering this game is 'adequate'.

Fantastic game for serious gamers, or as my friend would say, "purists."  Winning requires determining the best way of making money by blending three different money-making mechanisms.  A must play if you love counting.  I would own it, but half of my gaming group (girlfriend included) hate the game... they're not purists.

Interesting game, I like the feeling of pricing your wares.

UPDATE: There's a nice feeling of an economic engine in this one, and a very nice dynamic in undercutting pricing, spotting the hot commodities, and figuring out what each player wants (and mixing the shipments accordingly). Also, while shipping may initially seem overvalued compared to everything else, it does take 4 actions, versus the high potential for other profit-making actions to only require 1 action.

There can be odd issues with player order, if production/warehousing is on a downturn, since you may be stuck with nothing to do. However, such a situation probably goes away once everyone understands the profit possible in all the various actions. Underproducing can also slow the game down.

And this leads to the fragility of the economic engine. Players can screw themselves, badly, and take themselves out of the running even worse than by simple elimination. Think "ever-growing black hole of debt". (Well, not really worse, but it feels worse.) Perhaps unlimited loans would be an amusing variation, for expert players only, to allow extremely risky strategies. 

But beyond that, although it's never happened in my games, collusion can really screw the game up, if you exploit the shipping payout. If you play optimally, the collusion shouldn't last more than one turn, but this depends entirely on the players. It's never come up, but the fact that this problem can crop up is like a distraction... maybe it'll go away if I play a few more times.

If the play time goes down, it might rate a 7 for me.

Excellent economic game with a lot of strategy and decision making. Overall though it seemed a bit too dry.

This game definitely needs multiple plays to really understand how everything interacts.

Being my first time playing, I am trying to not judge the game too hastily or too harshly, but I initial reaction was "how stale!". Throughout the game I had this feeling of boredom, other players did as well. But I think the main issue was the level at which we the players were playing the game.The game still intrigued me (and still does), and for that reason alone I would like to play it a few more times, so I can see if who/how we play the game really influences the feeling I had during my initial play.

RATING: 7
I really want to like this series.  Great graphics and an interesting time period.  I know I just need to be more patient, but I find the mechanics too plodding.  I believe one would have to play this game several times to appreciate the nueances.  I fear I suffer from attention deficient on this one.  I will hang on to the game for the day I retire and can dedicate more time to this type of game.  There is much to like about the game, just for another time and place..

RATING: 7
Played 2 scenarios of this thus far. M&P is a fiddly system to say the least (think MOI before Infidel rule changes), but once you get through it all it is thoroughly enjoyable. Not sure so much about the wide disparity of the Close Combat table as it makes some results appear quite random. Nevertheless, I am looking forward to playing more scenarios.

Wonderful components. Very clear and well thought rules. The only problem is that It has too many markers for my taste, and too many references to tables.

RATING: 7
Polish wars battles add yet another layer of complexity, and Breitenfeld is a 1,5-mapper. And no Rocroix. Still, a mighty game.

RATING: 5.5
I have mixed feelings about this one. Goodlooking game with a great theme. I appreciate the low counter density and the way they are set up on the board, but I have my doubts on game design. This gamesystem is - in my view - overloaded with tables and rules, which adds little in comparison with the time spent. The inactive player reaction is a pretty annoying and complex thing and makes the gamesystem too heavy on the defence. For a player on the offensive you are never sure of continuation, which can lead to a counter attack. The close combat system is too widespread in its results and withdrawal of troops is also problematic and can harm you as much as fighting on. It's not a gamesystem that rewards courage. I've played the Lützen scenario, but instead of a chess-like, dynamic battle it was in reality, I end up with two lines opposed doing little, where every attack was smothered in blood.However I do like the order system, but do not agree with the order the wings are activated and pre-empted.

Appreciate the research, and interesting situations.  But to me, a very overloaded system both in charts and markers, with an extremely high fiddliness factor, and about the most awkward counter/marker stacking circumstances and frequency I have seen this side of GBOH.  It all works, but it's a lot of work.  I cannot put this much effort into a battle game.

RATING: 8
Another excellent game in the MUSKET & PIKE BATTLE SYSTEM series.  I played the Dirchau scenario, which is a cavalry action.  The Polish lancers proved very powerful.  Their lances will send any defender flying, but the Swede's got the jump on them, managing two continuations after their first activation.  That blasted the exposed part of my cavalry wing to pieces.

I like this system and will play it any time, but it is time consuming and there is a lot of counter manipulation to be done whenever forces are in contact.

RATING: 9
This system is what I measure all other wargames against. The games are packed with choices, and replayability is high.If you're new to the system, be warned that it will take a couple plays to absorb the rules to their completion. This isn't a light game. The rules are on the heavier side of medium in my eyes. Most scenarios tend to be long. The game can be very fiddly, too.

I'm having a hard time rating this one.  Maybe later I'll sort it all out in a review.  I really like the game, but so far have only played solo.  Nevertheless, I find that the game is hard work to play solo--it is a heavy game with a lot of things to think about.  The orders system is great and provides a lot of uncertainty when playing with another player, but I think solo it is too much work to manage both sides.  I'm giving this 5 because I just don't find myself motivated to pull it out after playing it ~3-4 times when I first got it, which is what the BGG rating system asks about.  The Polish battles are rather odd and Breiten 2 is *huge,* almost too big for my table.  This is probably not the best intro to the Musket and Pike system.  Really straightforward encounter battles (two in this game by my count and one of them is gigantic) are far easier to play in the system so that could be contributing to my reluctance to put it on my solo table.  It's a great game that feels extremely authentic and plays pretty smoothly which I really like, and this particular version of it has great variety in the kinds of battles.  I am tempted to get another game in the series, perhaps Lily Banners for Rocroi and the nice intro scenarios as well.

To really evaluate it I definitely need to play this with another person.  Consider this a preliminary rating.

Breitenfeld! The king of Sweden leads his seasoned German and Swedish troops against the Imperial forces lead by Wallenstein. Features Swedish Style two hex Heavy Infantry units capable of close combat in all three frontal hexes.


Musket & Pike Series: In general, the rules are written clearly. There was a bit of a learning curve, but for me, most of that involved being sure that the intuitive logic behind how I would play a tactical level Musket and Pike game matched what the rules said. Any attempt to simplify the system would result in an unacceptable loss of detail crucial to capturing the flavor of 17th Century European combat. It's well worth the effort. Lots of action and reaction, musket fire and pike stabbing. Forces are divided into three or more wings. Each wing must operate within the parameters of four possible orders: Charge, Make Ready, Receive Charge, and Rally. Changing orders is a matter of modified luck, reflecting the difficulty of directing troops in the haze of black powder smoke. The activation mechanics work well. Maneuvering the two hex heavy infantry units adds an interesting dimension to the hex and counter format.

This is an excellent game system which I have had a lot of fun playing.  The activation/orders method works very well in conjunction with the system's triplet of morale, formation and casualty.  The system nice captures a lot of the unique flavor of the period.

The Polish Wars battles included in this volume are a nice added bonus bringing in some additional variety to the system.

RATING: 8
My favorite system, and my comments from the previous volumes apply, in addition: 
 
The tables and rules are well designed, adding just the right level of detail to the battles with just a little bit of work. The reaction system keeps the inactive player in the game while his opponent moves and gives the games just the right feel for the power of defence. The attacking player can not be sure of continuation, and thus he better be prepared with reserves to deal with the inevitable a counter attack. The close combat system is decisive and tense, again you better have your reserves/second line in hand. It is gamesystem that rewards courage, the player's courage. 

There are both large set piece battles, like Breitenfeld, and more open, free for alls like Dirshau. The Lützen scenario works just like the real battle with two lines locked in a brutal slugfest.Also this game has special rules for the Poles and their Winged Hussars!

The release that brings the MPBS full circle, back to the battles covered in GBoH's Lion of the North. Clearly the capstone of what for my money is the best grand tactical battle series being published today, with some of the most famous personages of the era making an appearance in two marquee battles and three lesser-known contretemps. All wrapped in a splendid looking package. Have played Lutzen and Dirschau. The Polish contingent, which includes the famous winged hussars as well as mounted bowmen, steal the show from the dour Swedes . . .

I like the Musket & Pike series. The rules are at first a bit daunting but the work very well when applied to the game.

Excellent representation of the period - especially in that it shows why armies fought in multiple lines, and that it has 1620's Prussian campaign battles. A steep learning curve to play (hence the 9 instead of 10 rating) but I suppose it is one of the oldest problems in wargaming, realism vs simplicity, and these are good rules for what they are trying to achieve.

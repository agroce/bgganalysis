Have played this a couple of times. It is a very fun and sometimes challenging game. Great mix of push your luck and take that mechanisms. Funny thing about the game is that you're getting a game from one of the best card sleeve makes that you probably don't want to sleeve the cards to play as they will make them have less friction to keep them in place. I am really looking forward to playing this again and adding it to my collection of must own Mayday Games.

reasonably fun as a way to open or close a night, but doesn't have as much tension as you would think, and the cards are confusingly categorized into classes that apparently have no use (I assume there may be extra kickstarter expansions?). There are much better dexterity games, but this one is fine enough

Fun dexterity game that comes in a cool game box (a garbage can)that is also used in the game itself. I think the idea is a novelty but the gameplay always ends too abruptly. If any of the cards were to fall, it's almost always guarantee to exceed the amount of cards needed to eliminate a player. This probably has to do with the poor playtesting resulting in a poor player elimination criteria.

I've been on a dexterity game kick lately, playing and adding to my collection in this area. Garbage Day is just such a game brought to us via kickstarter... Lately I've been pretty hard on kickstarter games as all to many of them turn out to be utter crap... But not Garbage Day, its actually pretty good.

I won't say that its my favorite dexterity game, or really even in my top 5, but it is enjoyable and works well with larger groups. My only real complaint about the game is that it can go on for a long time. Once players start getting eliminated the game actually takes longer to play. Still an enjoyable game in a neat package.

I like the idea behind the game. We notice that it takes a very surprising number of cards to make everything fall. I think the KS upgrade to better card stock with a linen finish creates more friction than during play tests, because the game takes 20+ minutes before all of the card fall, eliminating one player. With five players, it can take an hour, and the first eliminated must sit and watch forever. If the pile fell at 20 cards, this would make sense. But we can easily get upward of 40 or 50 cards before we have to start slowing down and placing them carefully. The whole stack is usually bowing downward significantly before everything finally falls in a single 50-card avalanche.

A decent light dexterity game with a bit of luck and a (very) small bit of strategy. It does have player elimination which can be a bummer if the rest of the players a good and keep the game going. In this case, it's not a deal-breaker though. I had more fun with this than I thought I would.

RATING: 7
Very unique dexterity/party game.  Picked this up on Kickstarter because it was totally different from anything I have.  

The good:

You have to stack cards, but the two wholes have to be see through.

It creates some fun tension in stacking.

Take-that cards abound.

There is tension in adding to your room or taking out the garbage.

The bad:

The "Overflow" is when you get out, (when you knock off 4 to 5 cards).  It seems like when someone knocks off cards, they rarely get two or three cards.  It seems like a huge bunch of cards get out and the concept of "Overflow" is pointless.  Basically, when you have cards come off--your done.

Because a whole bunch of cards often fall off when someone gets out, the re-building takes a while.  It means "out" players just sit and wait.  

This, then, leads to a legitimate 20 to 30 minute game time--which is kind of long for a dexterity game when someone(s) are sitting out and watching.  

Overall:

I think it's a cool little filler game to have in the party collection.  Glad I have it, despite its minor shortcomings.

It's a fun dexterity game. However, it feels weird to me, as it feels to me that what makes the game fun (stacking cards onto the garbage pail lid) is not the same as what would win you the game (playing take that card onto others).

Tension filled stacker with a great theme that really makes you feel like you are defying gravity (until you aren't).  Love the garbage can shaped box which doubles as the platform for play.

First play impression criticism - could have used a few more action cards?

Initial Rating: 3.0 (May 2017)

Garbage day is, easily, the worst dexterity game I have ever played.

The rules are pretty simple to explain, you can do it under 90 seconds. Playtime though can be up to 45 minutes or more which is too long for such a simple game.

The game´s components are ok. The cards have holes in them and it is impossible to sleeve them due to the nature of the game (a huge issue for me) which is ironic because Mayday Games is one of the main sleeves producers an also the publisher of the game. The plastic recipient looks great but it isn’t practical to storage and the cards and rules suffer inside. The art of the game is pretty good.

The label around the container falls as soon as you unpack the game.

The theme is novel at least.

Gameplay is very boring and obvious. The cards have some effects but they are obvious when is the best time to play them. Unlike most dexterity games I have played, you can stack A LOT of cards together without making them fall, so the little excitement the game offers at the beginning dies pretty quickly. The overflow concept is meaningless because a player never drops one or two cads at the same time, when a player drops the pile of cards, he drops a lot of them, so the player gets eliminated without using his overflow space. Once a player is eliminated from the game, players (almost) begin a whole new game as it will take a lot of time again to make the stacking cards fall once more. VERY boring.

There are cards that don’t get explained in the rulebook and don’t have any effect on gameplay (gross, smell).

Bottom line, Garbage Day is an awful game, It seems under developed, the overflow concept doesn’t work, the stacking cards take a long time to fall, I don’t think they are the right component for a stacking dexterity game. It is very boring. The only redeeming factor is the art. I already sold my copy of the game. I won’t ever play it again.

Current Rating: 2.0

I just did not feel the love for this game that so many others have.  I'd be willing to give it another try but with so much else out there, I likely won't find the time.  Placing cards on top of a mini garbage can lid to make sure the holes in the cards line up is not my idea of fun.

Stupid little funny game. It's quite crazy how many cards can be stacked on that trash can! Therefore, we never needed to check the Overflow; whenever cards fell off, there are at least 10s of them! In a 4 or 5 players deck however, the deck may be too small (limiting the number of clean-ups per player), leading to ties. Therefore, adding a few expansions not only add more diversity, but also increase the deck size to provide a more balanced game with more players.

Just a solid dexterity game, not sure if I like this or Rhino Hero more.  

Also I never play this game with player elimination.  Each time it collapses it takes roughly 20 minutes so it would be horrible to have players sit out for 20+ minutes (even more with more players).  So I just play with the "biggest loser" rule.  So whoever knocks it down first loses the entire game (similar to Rhino Hero), I'll probably add in that whoever has the dirtiest room wins the game at that point.

Adorable dex game to place your junk on the trash can. You have a hand of cards that you can play with different bonuses and happenings. It is unique since the cards have holes in them and you have to look through to make sure you are playing by the rule to see the table below. Definitely a kids game but can be challenging for adults to place too. It is a fun game. Happy to play it. Family and dexterity for what it's worth.

Great intro to the best WW2 operationl system going at the moment. Germans have plenty of bite especially in the first few months which make for a very balanced game. The two maps and the low counter densities make this a good game to get into the OCS system.Some decent 1 map scenarios too. The east front games are a huge time commitment and this provides just as much thrills and head scracthing as the bigger games. Desert island must have game.

 Tanto el sistema como el juego de lo mejor que he probado. Un sistema muy bien engrasado y un juego impactante, donde hay que predecir bien y planear mejor los avances y donde no gana el que más ataca si no el que mejor gestiona. Un señor juego.

I have solitaired the Race for Tunis scenario into December and I am hooked. My intuition at this point is that properly played by both sides, the allies will rarely win the scenario before the onset of mud. To me, the most fascinating part of the early game is the scramble for the passes in the south.

Un jeu très plaisant à pratiquer, avec, certes, des "comptes d'épicier" à effectuer pour le ravitaillement, mais cet aspect est pleinement justifié à cette échelle. Par contre, c'est un système très exigeant où la moindre erreur peut se payer très cher. Les subtilités sont nombreuses et il faut vraiment un minimum de pratique avant d'arriver à être performant.

Automatic english translation:

A very pleasant play to practise, with, certainly, of the “accounts of grocer” to carry out for the supply, but this aspect is fully justified on this scale. On the other hand, it is a very demanding system where the least error can be paid very expensive. Subtleties are numerous and one needs really a minimum of practice before arriving at being powerful.

Great intro to OCS system. Takes some time to learn, but the best operational level WW2 system around IMHO. Supply is handled brilliantly and is an integral part of the whole. Really comes alive after reading Rick Atkinson's book 'An Army at Dawn'.

11/18/12: Initial impressions very good.  It really emphasizes supply and logistics much more than other wargames.  The downside is that it's a niche within a niche, so face to face gamers are going to be difficult to find.  Fortunately we have several in this area.

Tunisia is a good module to learn the OCS system with.  Relatively small and simple compared to many others in the series.  The particular choices for the counters weren't the best, too hard at first glance to tell everything apart.

If you're playing this, I really recommend reading Atkinson's An Army at Dawn at the same time.

Michael Barnes wrote an excellent article on what it is that makes ASL such an excellent game, one line which stood out to me in particular was "ASL is a game of little epiphanies".  I've only scratched the surface of OCS but I'm getting the same impression from this game.

OCS has opened new gaming insights for me;  More than ever, OCS is a system which emphasizes the *process* of working toward a win rather than the final outcome itself; It does this because the fog of war system relies so heavily on implied trust.  If a player wants to cheat, he can do so almost freely.  But to do so in OCS is a waste of time because the historical comparison becomes meaningless and therefore the whole point of playing the game becomes meaningless.  OCS appears to produce very historical outcomes, so the desire to try your own strategies inside the game's framework is very high.  You really want to see how your own play compares to history.

So it's a tentative 9/10, but it's the only game in the running to join ASL for top spot!

OCS : you like it or you don't. I don't. But I must admit the scope of Tunisia, the OoB, the map etc. are quite attractive. I found unit density incredibly high and I got bogged in the less-than-simple column shits, DRM, strenght modifiers of the system and of course, got swamped with the VERY tedious and deceptively "realistic" token/counters/accountant-based supply system. Too bad.

Another of the great, smaller OCS games, this is not quite on par with Sicily for scope or Burma for payability, but it has a lot to recommend it: modest counter denisty, very interesting situation, good balance, a critical campaign of the war, modest playing time (on the scale of these things anyway), and quite playable for a high-end wargame. The Allies deploy ultimately overwhelming forces, but there are quality issues (the Americans really didn't know what they were doing at this point) and the Nazis have some very powerful units with which to wreak havoc.

This also plays well three players once the 8th Army shows up, which unfortunately isn't for a while. If you haven't played OCS, I do recommend Burma or Korea first, but this is an excellent choice as well, especially if you're interested in the situation. Compliments GMT's Kasserine very nicely also (although they aren't the exact match that OCS Sicily and GMT's Invasion: Sicily are). Could use a couple of the technical innovations from later games (non-rebuildable units and T trucks, primarily).

This was my introduction to OCS. I never thought that I would enjoy monster games that played over more than 2 or 3 sessions tops or that had more than 10 or 15 pages of rules but I was fortunate enough to find an experienced and patient player who tempted me into giving it a chance.

The OCS system is head and shoulders above any other gaming experience IMO but there is no denying that it requires a correspondingly high level of effort and commitment. It's not so much the rules that are difficult as it is learning how to apply them properly and the time commitment required. More than any other game, new players will be baffled as to what to do when staring down at the board unless they have an experienced player on hand to offer guidance.

I prefer the more sane 2 player games in the series, like Tunisia, to the team play East Front monsters but the East Front games I've played have been truly unforgettable experiences.

OCS in manageable size shock! Exchanges the overwhelming cornucopia of the Eastern Front OCS games for the smaller scope of Tunisia. The initial scenario (and campaign) shows how the theatre was built up over months, and as a result is an excellent intro to the system - you can learn OCS by making mistakes and not waste days doing so. The biggest letdown, IMO, is the map, which is turgid and you may find some of the counters blend into the background.

Update: Sold.  Just couldn't stomach the thought of playing it again due to the 4 hour long player turns.  OCS is cool in concept, but brutally slow to actually play.

Update: Playing this again, with the 4.1 rules.  Really a fun situation, though I think the new air rules are a bummer.  Can't see using them again as written.

An OCS game I really enjoyed.  I think the minimal presence of "extenders" had something to do with it.

Comments specific to Tunisia

3 plays Race for Tunis, 1 of The Line, 2 Campaigns.  I have also played scenarios from Burma and DAK II.

My second favorite OCS title ... but that's not the most sterling endorsement.  Sadly Tunisia suffers from having been created with an older OCS rule set.  Changes to aircraft rules don't always seem to work, and the campaign's issues with generous maritime Axis supply remain.  The Line scenario is a slug fest among piles - boring.  The Race is great, but not very good for newbies as things need to be done correctly from the start and mistakes can really blow up in your face.  The Campaign is my favorite when it can be left on the table.  I like how the two Allied fronts, one powerful, but powerfully opposed, and the other green but on a very fluid front come together.  It seems too hard to snuff out the Axis however.

I would play scenarios from this title again, but I'm not clamoring to do so.


Comments on the System

The Operational Combat System takes an interesting view of operational warfare, placing supply considerations in the fore, but the supply system is cumbersome and fraught with logical inconsistencies.  For me at least, OCS' marriage of wargame and pick-up-and-deliver game don't work.  The supply system requires too much session time, and despite occasionally adding an interesting dimension to play, it is not engaging enough to warrant the time it requires.  

I focus on the supply system, because one can't enjoy OCS unless they accept its treatment of supply.  There is much to like in OCS, I love the way it treats artillery bombardments, troop morale, and reserves for example.  I'm less enthusiastic about it's lack of ZOCs, and the power of aerial bombardments, but I am happy to live with them both.

Here are the specific issues I have with the supply system.

Consider that the distance across which a headquarters unit can deliver supply to their subordinate units never changes due to weather.  This is ahistorical in the extreme, particularly in the system's home theater, the East Front of WWII.  The rasputinia comes, the hard freeze, the heavy snows, the subzero temperatures ... nothing impacts the distance at which a headquarters can deliver supply.  Other operational systems handle the impact of weather on supply, and do it with some elegance.  i.e. it can be done and done elegantly.  In my mind, the impact of weather on supply is a necessary part of simulating many theaters.

Consider, supply is moved by trucks and other conveyances.  If you want to unload supply in OCS, you have to pay movement points.  Fair enough, movement points represent time spent idle while supply is unloaded from the transports ... but not always.  OCS has a huge loophole that allows trucks to drive through an area and "throw" supply to units, units which are not in the same hex or even adjacent.  Units which can be several hexes away ... and again regardless of weather.  The trucks continue moving after "throwing" supply in this way, without penalty.  Put another way, trucks that "throw" supply move the exact same amount as empty trucks or trucks that don't unload supply during their move.  Only trucks that explicitly unload supplies in a hex (and it has to be a hex with a unit or a  Port etc!) pay a penalty.  This is a logical disconnect that makes no sense to me.  It favors positioning and game play that again, are ahistorical and counterintuitive.

Consider, motorized units burn supply to move using their inherent transport.  Many can opt to move "on foot" without paying that supply.  They move at a slower rate which is logical.  Now let's say they do this for several turns and move beyond the maximum range of their transport (ie further than their single turn motorized MPs).  The next turn, you choose to supply them with fuel.  They a flipped over, and their trucks, which they left more than a turn's movement away, now magically appear in their hex, at no additional cost, and they can move at their maximum amount.  Again this is a logical disconnect.  Worse, in a system that markets itself as demanding realistic planning, this allows players a freedom that real commanders never enjoy.  

Granted the alternative is practically unplayable, but OCS pushes the treatment of supply to the limits of "playability" anyway.

Finally consider what exactly is supply.  It is ammunition, it is fuel, it is concrete and other fortification construction materials.

Now consider that you move some of this generic supply to a specific area.  In your mind, you are moving construction materials for use in building a fortification next turn.  Now I surprise you by attacking in that area, and you burn the supply as fuel so that your motorized forces can move in response to my attack.  They burn construction materials?!  So you just spent several minutes managing a generic supply system and at the very last second that supply can magically become anything you need it to be.  An ability which again, I imagine real commanders dream of possessing. 

It can be argued that these latter two aspects of the system are necessary abstractions for playability.  Fair enough, but realize that the supply system that they are part of *dominates* this system.  In a typical turn you will spent 30-100% of your time managing supply.  Entire turns will pass where you do nothing *but* move supply.  This makes for a fascinating challenge at times, but in my experience it more commonly results in a grinding monotony.  A monotony that leaves gamers like myself wondering was all this supply overhead worth the time?  Couldn't the same effects have been achieved without the rather crude approach of moving dozens of markers around the map?


Further, the OCS treatment of supply tends to detract from the fog-of-war that wargames hope to achieve.  I can see you moving and amassing supply in an area ... should I expect your offensive efforts to take place soon?  Should I expect them to take place out of range of the dumps you've gathered?  A whole game develops where one tries not to telegraph their intentions.  Whether one likes such games within their wargames is a matter of taste.  Honestly, it rather interesting at times, but too much of a headache at others.

Should I bombard those supply concentrations within range, hoping to disrupt your offensive, or to throw your ability to defend against mine into chaos ... sorry, you can't bombard supply anymore ... it's immune.  I'm interested in seeing how OCS treats the siege of Sevastopol for example, where supply dumps were important targets of initial bombardments.  In fact, bombarding enemy supply concentrations is fundamental to modern attack technique.  Again, OCS has banned it as it was deemed too gamey.

In closing, *all* the wargames I play make abstractions.  I appreciate wargames that take supply into consideration in an elegant way.  Spending a high percentage of my gaming session managing a supply system filled with loopholes, logical inconsistencies, and ahistoric results doesn't hold interest for me.  I gave OCS a second chance (having disliked v1.0).  I can't imagine giving it a third.

Sold all my games in the series.

Probably the best OCS game to begin the system with (including Korea).
It is visually not very exciting (the maps of Sicily and Korea are much better done, also including some mountains terrain).
Both players have opportunities to attack depending on the period / reinforcements / supply available.
An optional rule gives the opportunity to transfer some panzer divisions from Enemy At The Gates (or the opposite).
It has a good replayability, partly due to variable Mud turns and reinforcements.
A very fun game I would recommand for those who like the subject but are not afraid in game length (> 50 hours to conclude a campaign).

Jan. 26, 2010 -- OCS Tunisia needs a lot more commenting than what I'm about to provide, but I'll try to add more at a later date.

As you may have heard about OCS in the past, the game is fairly complex and is really focused on supplying large military campaigns. Yes, you actually fight out the campaign, moving units and deciding where to attack and where to retreat, etc., but you live or die based on your supply.

For some, there may be far too much mathematics and logistics, but I kind of enjoyed the necessity of tracking supply points, keeping them coming from off-board and making sure all units keep within the throw distance of command points.

Four years ago when I first got into hex-and-counter gaming, you probably couldn't have talked me into OCS, but today is a different story altogether. While I wouldn't want to be focused exclusively on OCS, I'm looking forward to my next experience with the system (OCS Burma). 7/10

After playing this game, I found myself thinking "how can I get more out of my supply next time?"  It's a question real commanders seemed to ask regularly, but there aren't many games that convey that feeling to the players.

This is my favorite hard-core wargame, but I haven't played it in years.  It is probably the easiest of the Gamers' OCS series to actually play.  It starts out with a low counter density that makes it easier to set up than other games in the series.  The majority of the units on both sides enter as reinforcements.

I recently moved this down a bit in my rating because despite the relatively short setup time, it's still a monster game to actually finish, and I can't see myself playing it again anytime soon.  

Since discovering eurogames I've found that I'd rather spend more time playing shorter games.  Not necessarily just eurogames, but also wargames that can be played in a few hours rather than a few days.

For example, I'm now much more likely to break out The Mighty Endeavor or A Victory Lost than any OCS game if I want a good operational level wargame.

Played The Race for Tunis with a long time gaming buddy.  We ran into many rules questions and muddled through it pretty well.  At the end of the scenario we converted to the full campaign which we eventually called a draw after 3 more all day gaming sessions.  

*The campaign is very long*

We both enjoyed this game very much, it isn't a 'fun' game but is extremely deep and entertaining.  (if that makes sense)

The logistics-limited Tunisian campaign is well suited to MMP's Operational Combat System.  The scope of Tunisia is large enough (unlike purely Kasserine games) to allow the Germans lots of options, including a Thermopylae-like defense of the passes.  The game length and victory conditions are such that the game is a real cliff-hanger.  The overall flow and timing are historical without being straightjacketed.  The pieces and map are the usual high MMP quality.  Although the map isn't the classic “Gamers green” it is nonetheless easy on the eyes and reminiscent of desert landscape.  Considering the scope and number of turns Tunisia plays fairly fast, mainly because supply is far too limited for every unit to move and fight each turn.

It's OCS. And OCS awesome, and the battle is interesting, especially with the constrained terrain.

A surprisingly reasonably sized OCS entry, and of course in North Africa supply reigns supreme, so a good fit to the topic.  However, it also exposes some of the classic OCS foibles.  As always, play is driven by the search for the completely random double turn, as if we were playing old Third Reich and not something that presents itself as the last word in operational systems.  A smaller game is, even more than usual with OCS, susceptible to sudden blowout results when a combat goes wrong.  Want to make the green US armor divisions invincible on the attack?  Have them accompanied by the 5-rated French police battalion.  Right...

Kasserine Pass is now may favoured "intro to OCS" scenario:  three turns long; but lots of armour and air interaction; and some tricky decisions on use of reserves and the like.

The early campaign (at least) is a nice balance between numbers and speed (on the Allied side) and quality and counter-punch strength on the Axis side.

I have sold my first edition copy though, and will get my Tunisian campaign fix from the second edition (which is much prettier).

Played Race for Tunis and The battle for Kasserine Pass (three times).

First contact with the OCS system on the scenario Race for Tunis. I enjoyed the role of supply, the strategic depth of the system and I really want to replay it. The fact that the scenario is short and the number of pieces is limited to Tunisia are a good point to discover OCS system.
Only downside: the map is painful but allows a good reading of the terrain.

Premier contact avec le système OCS sur le scénario Race for Tunis. J'ai apprécié le rôle du supply, la profondeur stratégique du système et j'ai surout très envie de rejouer à OCS. Le fait que le scénario soit court et que le nombre de pions soit limité font de Tunisia une bonne première acquisition pour découvrir le système OCS de The Gamers.
Seul bémol: la carte fait mal aux yeux mais permet une bonne lecture du terrain.

More complex than MMP's SCS. Good gameplay. There seemed to be several bottlenecks at certain points on the map where both sides just ground to a halt and fell into a war of attrition. It is long. The board is too cramped. Nice components, otherwise.

OCS. This title in the series will be getting an update, possibly with better rules on artillery and especially anti-tank guns, which from the little I've read played a pretty large role in some of the battles, larger than the usual OCS rules account for.

I owned this back in the mid-90's but never played it.  I was a solo-only player back then with limited space so I found the OCS system too big and complex for my tastes.

Wargame depicting Tunisia in 1942. Part of the operational combat series, one has to consider how much supply they have, keep their units in supply and where to strike the enemy since attacks are wasteful of supply. Only played the introductory "Race to Tunis" scenario for eight hours. I understand the campaign games will literally take days. An interesting system, wargamers only need apply.

A fine entry in OCS.  A fine entry point into OCS, too, being easy to get the hang of, few special rules, small area, and small density.  

One of the nice things about Tunisia's campaign game is that it starts at the beginning with only a dozen units on board, so it will literally develop as the players wish.  It has a nice Kasserine scenario, as well.

Spent two weeks playing thru the campaign game (v4.0 rules) and confirmed that I like the system except for one minor (well in OCS, Major) point.  The supply rules just don't cut it for me.  Too much process and not enough play...  and in the case of Tunisia - most of the German army will spend it's time sitting around without enough supply or fuel (yeah yeah - they had supply issues, but getting just one division moving here is a task that's game-fun draining).

My first and so far, only foray into the OCS series, I like the system except for looking for the last increment or token of supply...and then deciding if I needed it for movement or artillery barrage. That got a little redundant and cumbersome, still like the game though.

I just started playing tonight, after several days of preparing counters, organizing storage, and selecting units to set up.

After 1/2 turn, I'm already amazed. I suspect this system will emerge as my favorite.

(Months later) Unfortunately, due to the amount of time it takes to set up and run a scenario and my inability to keep the game out on the table for extended periods, I had to wrap it up and sell it. Regardless, I intend to return to OCS in the future.

I played around with this learning the OCS rules and came to the point where it just wasn't worth it to me. I play ASL and musket and pike so it wasn't the complexity, but I just don't get much enjoyment moving supply points around and trying to figure out the best way to get fuel to my mech units. I appreciate games that put a supply restriction on operations as a way of increasing realism but this was a bit much. I am not going to disparage OCS; I have friends that love it and it is great at what it sets out to do, but I would rather play Afrika than DAK or Stalingrad Pocket than Enemy at the Gates any day. If I had unlimited time to play games, OCS would be at the top of my list.

Another of my personal OCS favorites and a great OCS introduction.  Both sides get the chance to attack and defend.  Strategically though, it's hard to understand why Hitler needlessly threw away an entire Army trying to hang to an obvious lost cause.

Based on one short trial game. Has all the components that I look for in an operational level game. Holds an aire of realism compared to many other titles.

---edit: A few games later: This truly is a managable and superb OCS game. Masterpiece!!!

---edit II: This game just keeps getting better and better. "Race for Tunis" is the perfect introduction for new OCS gamers and superb for the more experienced player as well. Longing for the campaign...

My first experience with OCS.  And I would agree with the consensus that this title is one of the best introductory games in the series.  

This is a game system with numerous layers of learning in order to master. The system is deceiving regarding it's complexity.  It is the smoothest read for a rules set of it's weight I have ever encountered.  And I found myself spending very little time searching for rules during play.  But when I did need to look something up, I had no difficulty in finding it quickly. 

One of the things I enjoy most about the game system is the injection of some tactical flavor such as Anti-Tank Effects, Action Ratings and Engineer Functions without detracting from the operational feel and flow of the game.  

While I have come to really enjoy the EFS series from GMT as well, OCS is absolutely the best WWII operational game system in my opinion.  Can't wait to play DAK with our group.

After playing this game I sold this and the other OCS games that I had. I don't think that OCS is my type of game. 

Update

I picked up a second hand copy of GB and gave it a play and thought that for this particular situation OCS did work okay. Horses for courses? Then I reacquired this game, not often I buy a game I rated a 2! But I'm hoping second time around I might enjoy it a bit more :)

An approachable introduction into the fantastic OCS system. What's so wonderful about the game is how it feels so unscripted - the rules merely lay out the fundamental mechanics of movement, combat, and supply. Yet, without any special rules to prod you in a certain direction, you immediately find yourself considering the same options that the historical commanders did and feel the same tensions between what you know your force is capable of and what operations you can logistically support. I greatly look forward to playing more of this, as well as other games in the series.

RATING: 3
Based on the core component retail box as listed, this is just that, a core game (starter set is more like it) and really needs the expansions to rate higher. There is a bit more included in this game than there was for Rivet Wars (as a core game).
Quality and artwork are what make this better than the average starter kit.

RATING: 8.5
Un juego visualmente espectacular, mecánicas inteligentes y entretenidas. Una sensación de MOBA muy bien aterrizada. Los personajes están bien balanceados y las tiradas de dados le dan un toque de azar que puede voltear las cosas. Es mejor para 2 personas.

RATING: 8
Great changes to the first edition. I love searching for cool hero combinations and the whole cencept of the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
As much as I am skeptical about the recent trend of turning computer games into overproduced, mini-heavy board games (Zombicide/Left 4 Dead, I'm looking squarely at you), the MOBA genre is one that was crying out for this treatment. Without the onerous obsession with frenetic micro-management and endless clicking in service of APM, MOBAs are actually fun!

Rum and Bones gives you enough heroes to scratch the strategic armybuilding/deckbuilding itch, enough variety to ensure replayability, a big enough board to allow for tactical positional play but not so large that it's overwhelming, and most importantly, enough luck that nobody feels like an idiot when they are getting keel-hauled.

In short, it's beer and pretzels deluxe - and I love it.

Havnet' played Marea yet, but I love the Deep Lords' Kraken pool manipulation.

RATING: 7.5
Definitely an improvement over the first edition, with each player alternating actions rather than taking them all at one time. I also like that now many of the hero powers are permanent upgrades, rather than one-time activations. Both new elements make the game more challenging, more strategic, and more replayable.

The game still relies too heavily on swingy die rolls, which prevents it from becoming one of my favorites (in my last play I failed three rigging checks in a row with rolls of "1"). If the game had been just moving/fighting with heroes alone, I would have probably tired of it quickly. Luckily, the Deckhand/Bosun deployment and movement add a layer of interesting strategy/board control that makes me still like to play this very Ameritrashy game.

RATING: 6.9
Definite improved over the 1st iteration. Still a solid distillation of MOBA game play into a board game. It moves along a quick pace and has decent strategy. Definitely an Ameritrash, random affair with a decent amount of drama.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Not a bad game but like most miniature games it focuses on getting as many minis into the box and onto the board during the game as you possibly can. At least in this case you don't feel like you are moving them all every round but there is still a fair amount of movement with the action. I heard a lot of negative things about the first version, but this version played fairly smoothly after a few rounds. I wouldn't mind playing it again, but it did go on a little long almost 90 minutes. If this was actually in the 45-60 min range I would consider picking it up, but with all the dice rolling each turn I would find it hard to get the game length shorter.

such a fun, humorous, and strategic romp that yes, does have dice but I really can't get enough of. Literally.  It is a game that favors having as much of its content as possible, but having got all of it post-KS campaign, it's worth it.  I'm planning on getting everything from Season 1 that is used with the help of the Upgrade Kit (pre-ordered), I believe I'll never let this one go.

My enthusiasm for the prior game made me a little bit leery of some of the changes, but I am pleased with the results. Making hero kills worth VP is a regrettable necessity given how people seemed unable to internalize paths to victory, and managing 3 heroes is fine given that the new upgrade system is sufficiently meaty. The new way sea monsters work is utter flukey nonsense, though, so I might be inclined to house rule it.
The new factions, though, are great--much more distinct than those from the previous base set.

An easy 8.  Very fun game.

Quibble: rules could be better (not terrible though) and the first game took a looong time.  

3 plays in and we are finding the game play long.  The first hour the game is an 8, by the beginning of the 3rd hour its dropped to a 7.  Hopefully it will speed up as we get more clear on the little rules.


May come to compete with Arcadia Quest for 'fun' but time will tell.

Just pure unadulterated fun and surprisingly strategic at its core. Have to know when to push, when to use crew, how to handle sea monsters and how to navigate each faction.

This one is probably my biggest surprise hit so far. Not everyone we've played with has loved it, but those that do enjoy it, really enjoy it. Most importantly, my wife and I love it. I may house rule the sea monsters a bit since they can really swing a game. There are other swingy / random mechanics of course, but they never feel game changing the way the sea monsters can be depending on when they come out. In any case, we have a ton of fun playing this one.

[UPDATE]
After many many plays it keeps getting better and better. OUTSTANDING game, top three all timer.

Big surprise, another one of these 'types' of games I assumed I'd hate and really, really enjoy (Zombicide is another one). We found it mega-fiddly to begin with and now it's smooth sailing (ha ha) and very easy to play. Amazing theme and miniatures/boards etc as usual from CMON. Love the gameplay with the 'AI' crew marching ever onward towards your defences while you use your heroes to clear a path, push enemy crew back and mess with the enemy heroes. Only gripe is with the Sea Monster rules, seemed to be a lot missing there that we had to come to BGG for clarification about (designer has said in one example that card needs additional text to be put in). That aside, well worth the investment of money and a bit of time to get to grips with it (not THAT much time, a couple of games only) and it's now solidly in our top five of all time.

My expectations for this game are sky high. It has everything I like about games: it's dripping with theme, it has combat, character building, customisation, tactical thinking and best of all: pirates!

RATING: N/A
Based on online MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) style games, Rum & Bones has 2-6 players taking control of legendary pirate heroes, each with unique powers and abilities, as their crews fight over Davy Jones' legendary treasure!

Players each control up to five heroes at any time, moving them across the game board in an attempt to destroy various key features on their opponents' ship. Victory is obtained by destroying enough of these features. Your heroes are not alone, however, as your crew also consists of deckhands and bosuns who, while not controlled by the player, will work on a simple AI to wreak havoc on the enemy!

Of course, what would pirates be without plunder? And in Rum & Bones the most sought after treasure are Davy Jones' mythical pieces of eight! Players amass these powerful coins during gameplay to unleash devastating abilities and attacks from their Heroes, crushing all enemies before them until only they remain!

This game is both a stand-alone and compatible as an expansion to Rum & Bones. In Rum & Bones: Second Tide, 2 to 6 players will take control of one of two deadly pirate crews: The mysterious and monstrous Deep Lords, who seek to claim Davy Jones’ treasure in an effort to flood the world and reshape it to their liking, or the Marea de la Muerte¸ a crew of ruthless gold-seeking Spanish cutthroats who will stop at nothing to claim the treasure for their own greed!

This isn't so much as a full sequel to the original game, more of a rules refinement bundled with two new factions to play with. This is far from a bad thing though as all the new rules improve the game no end, especially the changes to player turn order and the way abilities work. On top of this both of the new factions look great and are really fun to use, but it's worth noting you will need a conversion kit in order to use the factions from the previous generation with these rules.

game is awesome as expected, after a fast first play I can confirm that is absolutely a great game, improved from first season and almost perfect now ☺

Update after some more plays: the game in even more enjoyable. There is more strategy here than you could imagine, have to adapt on opponent playstyle and decide whether going for enemies, objectives, defend etc. And the crews are so many that an almost endless replayability is warranted with just one or two addons and also with, the base game.

I got the shipping email today and went to work and it had already arrived. It was a nice Christmas gift as we opened our presents 3 days late (we were traveling) so I had something awesome under the tree. Unboxed and playing with my son. It is a blast. Looking forward to the kickstarter bonus coming later.

Backed Kickstarter,  owned the first season, this one is much better. love the alternating activations. Lots of strategy involved. Got steamrolled by Deeplords on first play.

Pretty excited to give this one a try. I really wanted to like the first edition but there were just too many issues with the game being underdeveloped (I rated it a 3). This seems to have addressed most of my issues while making even more enhancements such as being able to level up your abilities, getting VP for killing a hero, and not losing your gold when a hero dies. There are still quite a few fiddly rules to keep in mind (rolling extra dice can't cause you to roll more extra dice, can't re-roll the same dice twice, etc) but that can be overlooked if the gameplay is good enough.

Update: Played once and it is a huge improvement over the original. Still not sure about the balance, though, as CMON isn't exactly known for their playtesting. The Deep Lords ran away with the game and I've seen reports online of the same results, even among people who have played several times.

There could also still be a little bit of a rich get richer issue. If you kill a bunch of crew or a hero then you get a certain amount of gold which can be used for upgrades, plus the other player now has the disadvantage of having less stuff on the board.

Despite the possible issues, the game is a lot of fun to play. There is more of a progression now because by mid-to-late game your heroes will have more upgraded abilities and you'll likely have more crew on the board, making things escalate quickly toward those final victory points. The game plays faster now (the old edition could drag on for hours) and even feels faster because you take turns back and forth now instead of each player going through the entire round one at a time.

Tentative rating based on how fun it is and of course the great production values. Rating could go up or down depending on how my issues play out.

Great silly fun, with surprising amounts of strategy hidden behind the dice rolling.

A little bit complex at the beginning, but an enjoyable game at the end. The best is probably 1v1, but i think 2v2 is fun too (3v3 seems a little bit too much for the classic game).

High Quality, Pirate themed, MOBA style, miniatures based board game. 1vs 1 competitive.   

First game was very enjoyable and lasted a few hours including reading about half the instructions (had already watch some how-to videos online).

Would describe as being similar to a competitive version of Zombicide.

Fast and fun. Great two player game...have not played with more then that atm, could see four being fun as well...but slower on turns...but adds some team talk to it. Simple to learn, but still adds some interesting choices and tactics to win...with a bit of chance to make it risky.

This is an across-the-board (no pun intended) improvement on the original Rum & Bones, doubling the possible pirate teams, greatly increasing the number of possible heroes, and decreasing both the downtime between turns and the overall time investment per match.

Combine that with wicked cool minis, and brilliantly explored game design space, and an impossibility to play this game in ever possible Pirate crew/Hero team iteration, this is one of the most fun games I've ever played and had already hit my table in double digits in the first three months of owning it.

Kickstarter 2016, exciting campaign, awesome miniatures, can't wait to play!

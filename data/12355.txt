Fast en easy-to-learn miniature wargame. A bit straight forward but with the right Civil War atmosphere. Leadership matters and keeping some units in reserve can help you to gain the day.

Maybe the movement rating of units is far to high. So you'll need a large table.

True to ACW-warfare - strong artillery - the defender go a large advantaqe. However a pickup-and-play pointsystem is not there, which makes it difficult to create balanced scenarios.

I like that through damage both armies are not so willing anymore to engage, true to reality.

The automatic activation of artillery makes it difficult to eliminate it.

The first tabletop miniatures game I ever played.  Like everything about it, especially that there are no automatic successes.  The troops didn't always perform up to expectations, and that is depicted very well in this rule set.

Not as in depth as johnny reb, but a system you can generally finish a battle quickly 2-4 hrs

Reasonably fast and fun game of the American Civil War. Not as complex as Johnny Reb but more so than Battle Cry. As I recall, something is not quite right about the way attack columns work in this game. Anyway, I prefer Johnny Reb and Battle Cry to this, but it has its devotees and understandably so.

Great game of Civil War combat. I had this game a while ago but lost the rulebook. I still have hundreds of 15mm civil war figures though.

Had a lot of fun with this game as well though, after a while I found that I was performing the same tactic over and over again. If I played the Confederates, I would always close with the weakest point of the Union line as fast as possible and charge. No fire fight, no artillery prep, just charge. Mostly because I knew that the Confederates could not stand toe to toe with the Federals in a fire fight. This counted for artillery and small arms where the Rebs got a bonus for melee. Anyway, I haven't played any other Civil War miniatures game that I liked as much.

I've got 2/3 of Gettsburg painted and I realized that was more than enough for this great game. I ran over 10 campaigns of my own design using this system. It's the best ACW miniatures I've ever played. I added a "Prolong" rule to the artillery which the game was sorely lacking.

RATING: 3
Getting to a point where I can't play this game.  The movement charts are the most frustrating example of what can be unfun with miniatures.  You will have a somewhat random chance that a unit will move during your turn.  Not your choice as in Memoir or DBA.  They just won't move.  However there isn't a result that they will move when you don't want them to (ie Dan Sickles).  Sorry too random and makes it feel like the game is playing you not hte other way around.  Basically a roll high and you win as far as combat.  We renamed this game "CHARGE"  because Melee is the easiest way to victory.

miniatures Good set of rules for medium sized ACW battles.  At 200 men/stand, you need too many stands for the really large battles.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Played this dozens of times. Reflects the sweep of ACW excellently, while capturing unit degradation and order unreliability. My main quibble is that artillery is a bit of a Ray-gun, which pulverises whatever it is trained on.

The standard ACW rules for our war gaming club. We have enjoyed many hours of gaming using the FaF rule set.

An excellent set of miniatures rules.  Well written with good diagrams and simple but "realistic" mechanics.  Good for both large scenario games and smaller skirmishes with a division or two on each side.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Works well with 3-6 players (have not tried it with more).  Plays well if you have 4-8 hours available.  Also allow for some set up time (the map, plus putting little labels on the command stands, it might take hours if you start from scratch.  Very easy to get back into after not playing for a while, you rarely have to look anything up or fiddle with charts.  Intuitive and fun, always enjoy these rules.

This was my first rules set that I have played that was designed for miniatures gaming. The game makes a refreshing change for the boardgamers, presenting something grand that can be played out rapidly by many gamers.
While the system has its share of tactical nuances, game play can be rapidly picked up by newcomers.

Well worth the effort!

Best rules for fighting large ACW battles - and I mean LARGE - you can do Antietam at this scale but you may have to rent space from the next-door neighbour. You move, opponent fires, you fire and them melee. These mechanisms seem to suit the ACW admirably where defence had a distinct advantage.

I've read a few sets of miniatures rules for ACW gaming.  This one grabbed my interest like no other.  Well set out, easy to read with gorgeous colour photos, this will be my rules of choice when I get my miniatures based and painted.

Perhaps the best ACW rules out there. Units are Brigades, which won't suit everyone, but you can easily play any of the actual battles of the war within a sensible time frame.

RATING: 8
The best ACW game out there at the brigade level.  The only flaw is the flat fire combat chart.  It seems silly when a very large brigade wit supports fires....and hits nothing.  The flat chart for melee makes sense based on years of reading and research into the period, but the flat fire chart....not so much.  The activation and command system works well and seems just right for the period.

Bought these rules in 1991.  I still have them, in perfect condition, but have never played a game.  Maybe one day!

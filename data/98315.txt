J'ai l'impression d'être a Fort Boyard quand je joue a cela. C'est assez léger. Une course sous le thème archéologique égyptien.

On doit aller chercher des trésors qui ont plus de valeurs dans la pyramide tout en évitant d'être piéger par les chutes de pierres.

I had mixed feelings about Temple of Chac. It was a fun romp but it seemed a bit too scripted. The boulder was certainly cool but I would imagine that would be only for those Indiana Jones fans out there. The problem with the boulder was that despite the dice rolls, no one ever got killed by it. It was too predictable. You didn't need to risk the boulder because no one went for the alcove treasures since they were much harder to get compared to the river. The bridge was lame, never trapping anyone and only one person in all the games I played ever tried to get the big alcove treasure (they failed and would have lost even if they had gotten it!). So I traded Chac away the moment I heard an Egytian themed version of the game would be coming out.

Pyramid of Horus feels better. My kids love the Egyptian theme so this version is a no brainer for me. The falling blocks seem to me to be a better timing mechanism than the boulder. Now there is real pressure because they are completely random. That makes timing your escape all the more crucial and creates a real push-your-luck element. In Chac you could time your movements so the boulder was never a threat and that just feels wrong. I think the scoring bonus for treasures from multiple gods is nice and encourages you to spend just an extra turn or two past when an escape seems certain. In this game the entire board is usable and useful unlike in Chac. The game feels a lot more balanced and is more enjoyable.

The more I play this the more I appreciate it and what it has to offer. It made a bad first impression, but more plays brought to light its strengths and just knowing its only about pushing your luck and managing your risk and letting yourself enjoy the theme goes a long way.

Nice family game with simple rules. You need 10 minutes to learn it.
The players have  one of eight adventurers and enter the pyramid of Horus in search for treasures. But there exist many dangerous such as snakes, scorpions and aligators as they try to injure you as you search for loot. As if that wasn't bad enough, the tombs contains mummies as well! 
Get in, try to get as much loot as you can and get out - if you can, because falling blocks (rocks) trying to seal the exit.
Finally, the miniatures are look so nice and if you are paint them, the game would be more wonderful during play

After playing the Adventurers: Temple of Chac, I had high hopes for this game.  But while Temple of Chac was light, fast, and fun, with the feeling that your adventurer was always one step away from death, this felt plodding and random.  Instead of insta-death events, you might get nipped by a croc. or tickled by a scorpion.  Each adverse effect causes only 1 wound (and you can take 12), so all the danger and dramatic tension is gone.  You might get locked into the temple by the collapsing ceiling, but there's so much randomness in where the ceiling tiles fall, whether you get locked in or not seems largely influenced by luck.  I would skip this one.

I liked it, and will probably play again, but the game's not perfect.  I got absurdly bad luck with three rocks falling on my head by the time I had finished my second turn, which is probably clouding my view of the difficulty of the game.  Could easily be an 8 if I get the chance to play again.

RATING: 6.5
Most sequels attempt to carry-over the strengths of the previous title and correct its short falls.  The Pyramid of Horus tries the same and succeeds on at least 1 of the 2 goals.  Gameplay is similar to its predecessor, but here improvements come into effect.  Instead of a character's load being determined solely by treasure, now load includes treasures, tools, and wounds.  This last is a big improvement over the original - since it lowers the risk of one-shot instant death (no one really wants to play 2 characters in the game, do they?).  Tools add a nice variety to the player's options as well.  Where Pyramid of Horus comes up shorter is in the visual feel of exploring a ruin.  The board is functional and works with the falling rocks theme, but it doesn't give you the sense of exploration that the original had.  Overall, the game mechanics are better, but at the cost of a bit of adventurous feel.  This is likely the better of the two in the series so far.

Cracking game to play with a young family - 5 and 7 in my case - rules are simple enough but provide for a little strategy that even 5 year old can understand - and the end game can get quite tense with those falling stones blocking off escape routes - play it deliberately to the wire as the adult to ramp up the tension and the children will love it if you do get trapped!

The differences created by the way the blocks fall makes for decent replayability, but it is essentially the same game each time so don't expect to play it every week!

UPDATE:  As always, I missed a critical game changing rule.  The special abilities can only be used once per game.  That makes a lot more sense because that stamina ability kind of seemed over powered.

First time playing this was a two player game.  I love the process for determining the available actions based on load and wounds and the roll of the dice.  I played as Delroy Chartier because of his stamina ability.  My daughter played as Chantal Sarti.  I liked the idea of playing as a character where his special ability is always useful rather than only when a block falls on me, but she wanted to play as a girl.  I collected stuff with little care for how much I was carrying where as she had be careful.  By the time the entrance was almost blocked, I had twice as much stuff and still managed to get plenty of action points to get out of there quickly.  My impression at the end of the game was that it has immense potential to be a great hit with more people.  As a two player game it lacked any real stress in balancing my stuff.  I got bit by crocodiles and snakes and even had a block come down on me.  I few searches in the sand and rubble and I was able to heal most of my wounds.  With a larger group and more people running around going for different types of treasures and using different types of special abilities, I think it would have a more intense race.

I am a huge fan of the original Adventurers game. I originally thought this would be a must-have, but then I heard some negative reviews and became a bit more wary. I think, for now, I still like the original better. However, there are a lot of neat original ideas here. Allowing characters to take wound cards which increase load level is a great switch from the original where one hit kills you. I almost wish that mechanism could be adopted in the original game. The bonuses for treasure variety is also a good mechanism because it makes players reluctant to go after a single type of treasure and run. I like the uncertain duration of the game too, that is somewhat reminiscent of the boulder in the original. There are 2 things I don't love as much. The cursed idols don't seem worthwhile. They aren't worth enough points to waste actions trying to capture them and then more actions because of the curse. And, more than anything, I'm not a fan of the exit-where-you-enter mechanism. This means that a player who didn't want to get in the spirit of the game could just step in, grab a few treasures and leave without taking any risk. Then that player could conceivably win. Still it is a fun adventure with the right group and it tells a story just like the original.

This is a lot like the Temple of Chac Adventurers game, but it felt just a bit too balanced.  The stones falling from the ceiling creates a neat atmosphere and some tough choices, but it feels like it's too easy to survive and many of the positive and negative effects are too similar.  I'd just prefer to play Temple of Chac.

I feel that this is a pretty good game to introduce to new players that haven't played much for board games and are looking to get into it.  It's simple to learn, doesn't really require a lot of strategy besides knowing when to start moving out, and it's a push your luck type game so you have a little bit of that anxiety rush throughout the game as blocks are dropping.

RATING: 5
A pretty simple push-your-luck type game, where you're trying to loot the temple for treasure.  Get too greedy, and you won't make it out alive, but play too conservatively, and you may not score enough points to win.

The game is super simple.  You get some actions each turn, which basically boil down to moving or picking up treasure. Some times bad things will happen to you when looking for treasure, like getting bit by a scorpion or snake.  The more stuff you're carrying and the more bad things that happen to you, the less actions you are likely to get per turn.

Meanwhile, the ceiling is falling in on the pyramid chamber.  It falls randomly, so you're never sure what space will be blocked next.  If the pieces fall in such a way that you can no longer escape, you lose!  So, the game is about grabbing as much treasure as you can without getting trapped.

The only thing I don't care for is that they added character abilities, but rather than give the characters any real abilities that would require some testing and balancing to give the character some real flavor, they gave each character a one-time use ability that barely affects anything.  The abilities really aren't worth the space they take up in the rule book and seem lazily tacked on rather than anything that's meaningful to the game.

Overall, the game boils down to a super simple and harmless push your luck game, and is fine for what it is.

A push-your-luck loot-grabbing fest - simple, and not too much strategy involved. I really like the wound mechanic, hidden beasties, and the idea of helpful equipment being scattered around the foyer from the excavation team's hasty departure (compared to the other title in the series, Temple of Chad).

Not so sure about the pre-programmed route that the mummies take, and perhaps the addition of another trap instead of solely relying on the falling blocks might have made this a 'must have' title.

I do so hope the series is given another entry, as the concept behind The Adventurers is superb, and works.

We enjoyed this one a lot. It plays quickly and has enough luck involved that young kids can have as good a chance as their parents. To contrast this with its predecessor, there is a lot more flexibility with the areas you can explore.  In Temple of Chac, you have a pretty linear course with a few options. In Pyramid of Horus, there are multiple areas you can go to. 

The alcove/dice combo idols still seem like a lower chance item. I think there may need to be some incentive to go to these, since you lose a die from the curse. I couldn't really see any reason to try for these, but maybe if I'd gotten some crowbars it would be worth it.

My son loved this game so much we gave it to him. Thanks Secret Santa! We enjoyed the thoughtful gift and made sure it would get more play than just at our house.

Chose one of eight adventurers and enter the pyramid of Horus in search for wonderful treasures. But beware of snakes, scorpions and aligators as they try to injure you as you search for loot.

After watching a couple of reviews for the product, a friend had picked up the game.  We played it at his house two straight times and I knew I needed to pick it up.  The game has that nice middle ground that works well with Adults and Kids a like (which I especially like with my Nieces and Nephews).  I can get in a game rather quickly, and our group enjoys the push your luck aspect.  I enjoy it a little more than I should and have died quite a few times within the pyramid myself, very fun, nice, light game that anyone can play.

Just the right balance of gimmicks and mechanics, revolving around a "press your luck" logic that folds injuries and goodies together as movement penalties.  The temple's closing in - do you hang back and try to grab one more treasure that will only slow you down on the way out?  Oddly enough some folks will, and players' personalities project very naturally into the theming.  Great fun.

Didn't think it was possible for the sequel to the Adventurers to take the lessons learned and make a worse game, but that's what they've done.  Random, random, everywhere, and not a drop to care about.  I won the one and only game of this I'll ever play by standing in the doorway and searching (along with everyone else) for good equipment.  I came away with a backpack and a ton of snake bites.  Then I moved to the sand and searched there until the stack was depleted (getting more scorpion bites than my fair share along the way).  At this time, a diagonal wall had built up that cut two of the other four players off from the exit, and I waltzed out, rolled well, and had a completely uninteresting and undeserved win.  Ugh-o-rama.

Fun set of plays through this. What was cool, was everyone in the game went in trying different approaches, and each could have won the game. The random tile falls cut off 1/2 the players, one of which could have won if he could have moved 2 more spaces before that fateful slab sealed him off from the sunlight.

The user powers are a little hit and miss but other than that I can see this being a hit with the kids as well.

It's hard to rate this one since it is clearly not a "gamer's game."  Viewed purely as a light little push-your-luck style game with nice components, rich theme, and a high degree of randomness, it actually works quite well and is kind of fun. Kids must be the target audience - mine love it!  

As a game for adults or true gamers, I couldn't rate it higher than a 4, bumped up to maybe a 5 for the great art direction, theme, components, and atmosphere. As a kids' game, I'd give it maybe an 8.

UPDATE: Bumped up my rating from 6.5 to 7.5 because months have passed and this one is still a huge hit in my household. My kids seem to never tire of it.

RATING: 7.5
It's a funny one because there is almost zero interaction.  You can't do anything at all to anyone else; the closet thing is maybe, very rarely being able to nick in and snatch a treasure that someone else was going to get, if you have a couple more turns than them. So you are running your own race. But the push your luck mini games, and the quick and light hearted nature of it, mean its guaranteed to create cheers and groans as the falling stones start blocking off exit routes. I tend to try and go for the Horus challenge - get the treasure deepest in the pyramid and needing a 1-5 flush dice roll - and get out. Everyone else gets out and pulls stones waiting with bated breath to close me in.  Good fun.

A solid thematic yet random push your luck adventure game.  The context gives plenty of details for an emergent story to happen as the players rush around grabbing as much treasure as possible before the pyramid comes crashing down.  I can see playing this every couple of months for several years.

The bits and artwork were excellent.

My rating: 7 

Not an expansion, but a stand alone game.  Very similar to the first one, The Adventurers: The Temple of Chac . . . but also so different.  Instead of trying to keep ahead of the rolling boulder on a path, here you are dodging (hopefully) granite blocks that fall from the pyramid's ceiling and might block your exit and seal you in.  In fact that is what happened to us--out of 36 blocks, the first five (one falls every round) sealed us in--we all lost and the game won! 

In this game you dash into the pyramid, go anywhere you want to locate treasures and suffer wounds, and then dash out if you can.  Naturally, the Biggest treasurers in the rear of the Pyramid.  

The components again, are very nice--nicer than they need to be (one of the players pointed out that instead of huge, plastic, 3-D blocks, they could have been flat, cardboard tiles).  It is a pain to put away the game--many of the components have to fit under the insert--the insert is difficult to work with.  It hurts me to remove inserts, but this one irritates me.  

Those who played are ready to play again.  If you like the first Adventurers game, which I also rated a 7, you will probably like this one.  Glad I own both.

EDiT:  The general consensus is, we like this better than The Adventurers: Chapel of Chac (which we also enjoy).

Very similar to the other Adventurers game, but still has a unique feel. This one offers a little more freedom of choice as you are not pushed along a certain path. It has a bit less theme but both games are still very fun.

I like the uncertainty of when the entrance might collapse, it makes for some interesting push-your-luck decisions. Game looks very nice and its fun putting down the big ceiling tiles.

[b][i]The Adventurers: The Pyramid of Horus[/i][/b] is a light push-your-luck game of treasure hunting. Your character slows as you take wounds and grab treasure. Worse still, "stone" (plastic) blocks fall and can seal a greedy or careless treasure hunter in the pyramid. The strategy is light and mostly revolves around calculating how much longer you have to grab fortunes before you're trapped. If you like the idea of trying to decide whether to grab the last piece of treasure before limping to the door as the tomb collapses, then I would recommend this game to you.

Unlike The Adventurers: Pyramid of Horus, the similar Temple of Chac feels repeatable and linear to me; these factors lead me to prefer Pyramid of Horus.

This one is as fun as the original, but different enough to warrent owning both. Players run into the temple and try to collect as much loot and then get out, before becoming trapped. The game is fun and provides a lot of laughs along the way.

This is a great one for the kids and family. Even gamers will enjoy it every now and then and it plays quick enough and is easy to teach/learn.

Many thanks to my good friend Matt, for introducing me to this game.

This is almost as good as the first one. Although, I enjoyed the Temple of Chac a bit more. Horus feels even more random, and getting boxed in on your first few turns due to bad luck really sucks.
At least with Chac, if you died, you could start your second character. Not so with Horus. Once the entrance is blocked, or you get surrounded by falling blocks, you're screwed and it's game over for you.

It's good, but I prefer Temple of Chac; it looks cooler, and plays better.

Very broken game. Much better if you play alternate rules to fix the issues (good tutorials on fixes on boardgamegeek by other users), but annoying that you have to do that.

I only give it a 3 due to art and the fact that after some effort researching alternate play, the game was fun.

My overall impression of this game is that it over-complicates push-your-luck adventurism by adding more rules. However, this complexity does not add to the depth of the game. Accordingly, I still think that Diamant still delivers a much richer rules-to-depth ratio or that games like Tikal make exploration rich but also incredibly much more strategically (and tactically) meaningful.

So I never played the first version and can't compare. For this one, most agreed set-up was too long for this type of game, but otherwise it is a nice family push your luck game, VERY much like Diamant. Get in, get treasure, get out, only this is much more visually appealing, and there are a couple more decisions to make.  I could see where this might run a little too long, but it never in our game since the “road block” came VERY quick and 3 people got trapped ending the game.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (December 2012)

Fun game, but not my kind of game. It has a lot of uncontrollable luck. I enjoyed it more than is predecessor The Temple of Chac, but I believe (hope) that I won’t play this again in the near future. The game can be fun, but the winner is decided 90% by luck. When I play this I feel that I’m wasting my boardgaming time.

The game components are awesome, the miniatures very well done and the ceiling blocks are very thematic and add a welcome “push your luck” element that (IMO) makes the game as it adds a lot of tension. However this is a game that I would like to play ONCE a year tops. I’m downgrading its rating so it matches my feelings with the BGG rating system. 

Perhaps this is a good game to introduce to your non-gamer friends or when you want a game in which you almost don’t have to think.

Played this twice with a mixed group (hard core gamers and non-gamers) and both results were a lot of fun. While it's mechanic is very simple with not a lot of choices to make (move & dig are as complex as it gets), the game's push-your-luck matrix provides thrills especially toward the end of the game as the entire pyramid is falling in around you and you're keeping your fingers crossed that the dice rolls are enough to get you out alive. Enjoyed this game very much!

A strange little game that's fun to bring out from time to time. It's about adventurers moving through a pyramid trying to find treasure and avoid mummies. It should be a little more fun than it's proven to be so far, but we'll continue to bring it out from time to time when different groups form.

Descend into an ancient Egyptian pyramid with The Adventurers: The Pyramid of Horus, a standalone board game of danger and exploration for 2-6 players. In this fast-paced and tense experience, whichever player escapes from the pyramid alive and with the highest Treasure value wins the game. Will you emerge bearing priceless archeological treasures or will you succumb to the mortal dangers waiting inside? As one of eight Adventurers – each with a special unique power – you can explore the pyramid, searching for archaeological relics hidden or buried in four chambers or corridors.

The gameplay is still a push your luck at its core, but a lot of interesting ideas have been added to the game. Tired of players gaming the system and just keeping the load level at 3 with the best 3 treasures they can find? How about some scorpion/snake/alligator wounds that you can't discard that will act as treasure? Had a bad game where the boulder rolled so slow you could have run the course twice and still beaten it to the exit? How about we have some heavy slabs of rock fall on you instead? All in all I would say it's another hit for the Adventurers team. Will definitely be picking this up when it is on sale.

I bought this game for my 5 year old for Christmas and it has quickly become his favorite game.  I have even caught him setting this game up just to play with the boulders and people.  He loves collecting treasures and really understands the push your luck mechanic to the game.  I have been trapped in the pyramid both games and died.

This is fun, played with 2 will be better with more.  Not sure about taking turns to take actions but with more players can see that may be important. At one point noticed that there was a line of blocks across the board and we both just escaped, the 2nd had the block he was standing on that closed the temple hit so he dived out the right way - an epic ending really. Not sure how you avoid people standing inthe sand seeing if they can pick up a few bits of treasure but that gets counter productive after a while. 

Like it as it is but wonder if it had ways of dumping your fellow players in it it would be better. Would make it more complicated though.

First off, any game in which quality pre-painted miniatures are available (whether out-of-the-box or as an add-on) makes me happy, since they are wonderfully thematic.

Anyhow, I like this game. Compared with Temple of Chac, this feels like a conceptually simpler game, but possibly also a little more fun. It also feels like there is a little more room for strategy; definitely the first game you should get out of the series.

The bits are attractive, the rules are well-written, and the game is a fun implementation of the push-your-luck mechanic.

Another great thematic push-your-luck type game like the original The Adventurers: The Temple of Chac, this game is very similar in mechanic but offers a bit more in terms of consequences for obtaining idols and losing dice results from a die. The game can be very chaotic given the nature of random blocks falling, but has less variety of room types than the original game.

RATING: 7
A good game for those who love adventures, luck, unexpected turns of events and some strategy involved. I personally prefer this over 'Temple of Chac' because of the unpredictable falling off the boulders, which might make the game long or short. I've played this with my gaming group once a week for numerous times and it grew on us the more we play. We also implemented a small variant which allows the players on the same space to rob each other of their treasures, which makes the game more enjoyable.

RATING: 7
It's a decent push your luck game with some great artwork and easy to teach rules.  I prefer this over the original Adventurers The Temple of Chac since it doesn't have player elimination and there isn't numerous rules to follow.  While I do consider it to be one of the better push your luck games out there, it is far too overproduced for the market it is aiming for.  The price is simply too high for a game that will get old after half a dozen plays or so.  I've played it around 4 times and I don't have any urge to play it again since I prefer to spend my 30-45 minutes of light gaming on Flamme Rouge or Modern Art.

Much more interesting than ATOC, with a lot more variety provided by equipment, mummies, biting snakes, etc.  however misses the driving momentum/fear/risk from the boulder approaching (even if in the previous game you just jumped into the water and risked the jump out at the end.

We were up and running inside of 15 minutes. The rules are easy and game play is relatively uncomplicated. I was sure that I was going to win until the blocks cut off my fastest route of escape. It was a race to the finish between me and my rival until a block cut off the last route to escape. One of the less greedy won the game.

RATING: 5
Disappointing. I don't know how this got on the BGG gift guide. Agree with the main points of CapAp's review. It's not just that there's 18 sources of randomness, the variance is maximized as well. Treasures worth 1d6? Because what, the only possible way to have a variable value is 1d6? So, the game is likely to be determined on a die roll. It's not like this game really needs a counter-measure to AP. And of course, the game end is highly variable as well.

I also thought the rulebook was shit. Just because the game is French is no excuse. Flavor text I can abide, as long as it's clear what's what, which it was. But, no overview, no mention of how the game starts, presentation is in an awkward order... meh. Honestly, I'd rather play Gnip Gnop.

A light and fun push your luck game, Pyramid of Horus is tidier and I feel somehow better then its predecessor.

Components are sexy Ameritrash at its best, including large plastic slabs, nice artwork and plastic minis.

The game is totally luck driven though, so don't be surprised when the game ends in 4 turns because the first slabs to fall make a nice neat line that blocks the exit before the game has barely started!

Is so simple that it can be used quite nicely in the "filler" category.

Would also make an excellent gateway game for non-gamers, as it has the formula to reel them in and make them realise that there's cooler stuff then Monopoly!

RATING: 8
A more streamlined design means less moving parts but the tension is as good if not better than the original as the players are really required to race once another and the means for blocking the exit to the temple is a very real threat.

The game also adds items that can be fond to increase the number of powers available to the players. 

Doesn't make the first game redundant but it is at least as good and this i probably better for younger children too.

Push your luck with great bits and theme, not as harsh as Dungeonquest. The basic idea is the same. An easy game improved by adding 5 D6 for lock picking and mummies actions. Don't disturb the action dice for any reason until the next turn starts. Quite a looker of a game once painted up.

I am a huge fan of the first Adventurers game. The rolling ball is amazing, the lava pit, the closing walls and the raging river that ends in a waterfall...just awesome. So...what about The Pyramid of Horus? Love it!

The adventure continues...
Your adventurers will be plagued by snake bites, scorpion stings, crocodile bites and mummies curses. The game play is simple get in and whenever the mood feels right and you have the treasures in hand...get out! But wait...what about the falling boulders. This is where the game play gets exciting. At the end of a round when all players have taken a turn...a boulder is selected from the box and will be placed on the board...
perhaps crushing a character...
or perhaps sealing them into the pyramid forever.

So far, the boulders seem to add a great intensity to the game. Some games we are all sealed in before we have barely collected 1 or 2 treasures. Sometimes maybe 2 of us get out while 4 are sealed in forever. We have even played a game where all but 1 survived with 10 or more treasures in hand. You just never know what will happen...that makes for a great game!

It's a simple game that's hugely luck-dependent, but the theme really brings it to life and makes it a fun experience, especially with kids. There's a base movement for everyone which is randomly determined each turn, but each player adjusts downwards based on their load (ie the treasures you've collected and wounds you've taken). This is nice because the big treasures are at the end of the pyramid, but then it's going to be tough to escape the pyramid alive, making it high risk / high reward to go after them. Because after movement, a stone block randomly falls, and these gradually cut off escape routes. Collecting treasures is just turning over cards for the area you're in, which could be wounds instead. There's a real sense of racing in, grabbing what you think you can get out safely, and then racing back out. Or playing it safe and staying near the entrance picking up little treasures and hoping the high-risk adventurers all get shut in. It lasts the right time, anyone can win - a nice family game.

RATING: 6
"Push-your-luck adventure game. Fun, but at 90 minutes it was far too long. And I don't like the 'big bet' of when to head for the exit."

What I like:
- Great theme, and decent components
- Several clever mechanisms, including catch-ups

What I don't like:
- Unclear iconography
- Not a fan of games like this where you have to make a single big win-or-lose bet
- At 90 minutes (5p), it was 30-45 minutes too long

Ultimately, you have to decide when to stop hunting for treasure, and head for the exit. Unfortunately, the closing of the exit is so random that it could happen surprisingly quickly, or might never happen despite looking imminent for several rounds. Of course there are other forms of randomness in the game, but that's the one that rubs me the wrong way. 

At 30-45 minutes, I might still enjoy this one from time to time. If it is going to take 90, I'll pass. It felt a bit too crowded with 5p, and that probably also contributed to the length. I suspect 3-4p is the sweet spot. With 2p, the players would hardly even know the other is in the temple, which probably wouldn't be that much fun. 

I would put the weight around 2.1, based on complexity. It's not very deep at all.

Press your luck style game of adventurers exploring and looting a collapsing pyramid.  This is the second in the ADVENTURERS series of games.  Like the first, them theme here is very strong.  You really feel as if you are a an adventurer seeking after the treasures of a ruined pyramid.  Plenty of danger to be had from scorpions, snakes, alligators, mummies and falling stones.  Getting out of this pyramid alive is a challenge.  The mechanics are the same as the first game (The Temple of Chac) but this time an injuries incurred increase your load level which in turn affects your ability to carry treasures and hinders your choices.   In addition, certain treasures offer great reward but come with a curse... preventing you from using one of your die.  Can you make it out of this pyramid with the most treasure?  This one plays a little quicker than the first but again offers a highly thematic, tense, and fun gaming experience.

Dungeonquest ultra light, except you don't get to build the dungeon/pyramid.

Better than The Adventurers: The Temple of Chac simply because it's much easier to teach and plays incredibly fast.

We only tried this at two players (it's really for 3-6). It's probably more exciting with more players: more players means less resources, which means players have to take bigger risks. However, there might be much more downtime because players do not interact with each other at all, other than players measuring up each other with regards to risk management.

First off I love the premise – a collection of adventurers are exploring the ancient temple to the bird-faced Egyptian god, Horus. The winner is the one who makes it out of the temple alive and with the most valuable collection of treasure. Each adventurer has his or her own special ability to help the player in the game.
 
This is a press-your-luck style game where you must decide how much to explore. After each round one square of the temple collapses, which is represented by a gray plastic square that covers one square. If it lands on you, you are wounded which forces you to carry less treasure. You also have to watch out for crocodile bites, scorpion stings, snake bites, and the mummy’s touch.
 
I really like the way the game keeps track of damage in that you have fewer moves and/or objects that you can carry. So there is no need for pencil and paper during the game. That being said, it is not a simple game to learn or teach. There are multiple aspects to the game depending on what part of the temple you are in. I wish the designers could have found a way to integrate these parts better. 

The components are of good quality, but the miniature size of the cards are a little difficult to deal with. I understand the reason they are small – if they were larger, the game board would have been a bit unwieldy. But it is still makes game play a little difficult.
 
I lead this game with my kids, nieces, and nephews ranging in age from six to twelve and they had a good time (though I had to tell them how many moves they had each round). 

Overall, I love the theme and some of the game mechanics are ingenious. But the fractured and somewhat complicated set-up will limit the replay value for me.

An enjoyable game and a nice departure from the style of games we typically play. There is a decent amount of luck involved here but the nature of the game and the fact that it plays quickly makes the amount of luck tolerable.

I am a family gamer. I don't mind a lot of luck in games, but this game is too much luck and not enough strategy involved. It does get exciting though when the pyramid starts caving in, that is by far the best part of the game.  In a nutshell, not good enough to keep.  It's going to the trade pile.

Press your luck as you decide to sweep up as many treasures as you can before the exit path is blocked.  Plays pretty quickly and can be subjected to group think (if one person starts to run out, will the others follow?).  Actions, traps, and treasures are pretty simple so the hook here is the falling stones and their ability to block the exit paths.

I've had more fun with this than I anticipated. It is a fun family game and my daughters really enjoys it. Many of our games have actually ended with one or more adventurers being trapped. Maybe we have bad luck, or maybe we just push our luck too much.

[b]The Good[/b]
:d6-1: The visual presentation is attractive and complements the theme. We have the prepainted miniatures. They really help spice up the game. The other components and the artwork are nice. Without the prepainted minis, it would still be a good looking game, just not as sparkly.
:d6-2: The "push your luck" element has teeth, at least in our playing experience. Get too greedy and keep searching when you should run and you may find yourself with a lot of points, but still losing once you become trapped. I appreciate that there are actually consequences.
:d6-3: I really like the encumbrance mechanism. The more you carry, the more likely you won't be able to perform as many actions. It's nice that this element has some randomness involved, as you never can predict how much you'll be able to do. Even a lightly encumbered person may occasionally stall out for a turn. 
:d6-4: To piggyback off the point above, I really like how wounds add to your encumbrance and limit your mobility and the treasure you can carry.
:d6-5: Grabbing the idols, while more valuable, will limit your actions afterward as you become cursed. Cool mechanism.

[b]The Weaker Points[/b]
:bd6-1: There are lots of decisions to make. Not sure how many of them actually matter. Because luck determines nearly everything in the form of card draws and die rolls.
:bd6-2: I don't think I would enjoy frequent replays unless there was a time gap in between them. I don't think there's enough variation to keep me coming back more often than once every couple weeks. 
:bd6-3: Player special abilities, while appreciated, are fairly weak. Of course the game plays so quickly that maybe they shouldn't be more powerful.

[b]Final Verdict[/b]
Good for families with younger kids. The younger audience will probably get absorbed into the theme and really enjoy the tension. Adults will likely find some enjoyment here (I do), just realize the older audience may get turned off if it's played too frequently. I certainly have no problem coming back to this game a couple times a month with my family.

I like this much more than the first Adventurers game.  In the first game I never thought I would get trapped and I never took the lava path, it felt less like push your luck and more like "draw cards until there are no more cards".  The unpredictable endgame of this one really adds to the tension.

As far as a push your luck game goes, this one is so much fun! I like this one better than the Temple of Chac mainly because it has the wound/poison cards. As well, the end game bonus (for having the 5 different treasure types) gives you something to strive for. I really hope FF puts out a Temple of Chac expansion adding in wound cards. It would really help to make the series compatible.

A really enjoyable, push your luck family game. Players advance through various areas of the pyramid attempting to uncover valuable bits of treasure (more valuable the further in you dig). Unfortunately, there are some issues for you such as: nasty things in the treasure decks, too much loot slowing you down and of course, the fact that every round a piece of the ceiling collapses thereby possibly sealing you inside forever. Light but great fun. Very thematic.

I like both Adventurers games and think they're great for playing with kids. However, I think this one has the edge over the first one for a few reasons. 

First, the nonlinear board that changes throughout the game due to the falling blocks leads to greater replayability. Whereas the first game feels very similar from play to play, in this one, you often have to adjust your strategy as paths back to the entrance start to close off.

Second, I like that the new wound system makes it harder to die in this game. Player elimination can still occur, but when it does, it's generally right near the end of the game anyway.

Third, I like the ability to find tools that can influence your strategy during the game.

Finally, I just think the risk-reward decisions are more interesting in this version, as you add in things like a bonus for collecting different kinds of treasures and high-valued treasures that also carry a curse.

There's no doubt that luck plays a heavy role in the game, and there's not enough depth to support playing it too frequently, but every time I've pulled it out to play with the kids, we've had a blast.

This is a great family game that is filled with theme. In this game players are exploring an ancient pyramid searching for treasure.  The goal is to grab as much as you can while trying to avoid mummies, falling ceiling tiles, and other dangerous vermin. It has what I consider to be a very unique concept where each individual player can choose to end the game for themselves anytime they want by running out of the pyramid before the exit is blocked. If you get trapped in the pyramid then you die. The whole thing has a very fun risk versus reward feel to it.

This sequel won't sell as well the original, because the only traps are falling slabs and they are poorly depicted on the box.  That's a shame because this is the better game.  Pyramid of Horus retains the load-limited dice action points of the original, but movement is no longer linear. Players explore the crypt in all directions and then struggle back out before they get killed.  Pyramid of Horus qualifies as a full-length PYL game such that Diamant aspires to be, but cannot.

I like this quite a bit more than I expected. It's fun to run around grabbing treasure and trying to get out before the temple collapses. Very much like a board game version of Incan Gold.

Unfortunately the luck factor is pretty significant and a string of bad luck can be devastating. We had one player draw several bites and stings in a row and basically get eliminated from the game before the halfway point. Another player spent three turns in a row trying to pry open an idol, but the dice just didn't turn up in her favor so that made for a lot of wasted time.
The player powers are also pretty lame. They're all one time per game and are pretty unremarkable. I would rather have ongoing powers in this type of game.

If you go in knowing that luck can be a big factor, then this can be a fun push-your-luck style game.

Sold.

I might just like this better than Chac. The elements of Chac are more thematically adventurous and more varied, but some of those elements may be less viable than others (see my Chac comments). The probabilities in Horus seem more transparent so the press-your-luck aspect actually feels a bit more present which makes the game a bit more tense. 

I also think I prefer the timing element of the collapsing roof better than the boulder.

This one is also easier to teach than Chac.

Okay, enough comparison. The game stands up on its own and makes for a pretty and elaborate press-your-luck game when you want more theme than Can't Stop or Cloud 9, but don't want to spend the 2 hours to play Formula D



Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 4
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 4

The Adventurers is a dungeon dumpster dive.  You run in search around a little bit and then race out before the ceiling crashes down.  It felt a lot like Infiltration to me.  

The basic mechanic is that count how many treasures and wounds you have and check a chart to get your dice number.  You roll five dice and get an action for every die equal to or above your die number.  There are four or five different areas to search which have treasures of varying values.  The lowest level treasure area also has some tools that will help you.  The medium level treasure areas have some traps that will wound you.  And the highest level treasure area has zombies patrolling it, with the very highest items requiring some dice rolls to "unlock" them.  Every round a piece of the ceiling falls blocking a space.  

There's not much to this game.  Run in, look around, grab as much as you think you can get before the ceiling falls in too much and then waddle out as fast as you can.

While the cards are better (wounds, antidotes, bag that carries treasure), the game lacks the overall tension of the original.

Hidden for centuries below the shifting Egyptian sands, the Pyramid of Horus sat undisturbed, until a research expedition on the limestone plateau of Abu Rawash uncovered it. Filled with treasures as rich as the Nile delta it borders, the pyramid is a beacon, summoning a group of exceptional Adventurers eager to put their hands on the priceless archaeological relics contained within. But with a myriad of hazards lying in wait, once you enter the pyramid you might never come out.
\13\\13\
Descend into an ancient Egyptian pyramid with The Adventurers: The Pyramid of Horus, a standalone board game of danger and exploration for 2-6 players. In this fast-paced and tense experience, whichever player escapes from the pyramid alive and with the highest Treasure value wins the game. Will you emerge bearing priceless archeological treasures or will you succumb to the mortal dangers waiting inside?
\13\\13\
As one of eight Adventurers – each with a special unique power – you can explore the pyramid, searching for archaeological relics hidden or buried in four chambers or corridors. But perils haunt your pursuit of treasure, and falling stones threaten to trap you inside forever if they obstruct the only way out. Adventurers must also be wary of hidden threats that can wound them and living mummies who roam the corridors!

Disturbing a cursed pyramid has its hazards, but there is no adventure without risk. Can you make it out alive and wealthy or will this ancient Egyptian tomb be your final resting place?

It's easy to directly compare this game to the other Adventurers game: they have roughly the same setting, the same characters, the same game play, and the same push-your-luck mechanics.

I enjoyed my one play, but for my money, I'd go with the other one since it reminds me so much of Indiana Jones.

I enjoy this game for what it is - a very light and quick adventure game with little strategy.  I would agree with what others have said about this sequel in the fact that it plays very similar to The Adventurers: The Temple of Chac.  If you, however, loved the original, then you should definitely pick this one up!

I actually like the theme of this one a little more and all of the "danger" elements are not only thematic, but all offer something new.  With this in mind, I do prefer The Temple of Chac as the dangers just seem  a tad more imposing.

If you enjoy the first Adventurers, you will enjoy this sequel as well, but it is not necessary to own both as they provide the same game experience.  It would make a great gateway game, especially for children of a certain age.  Adults will enjoy it too, but keep in mind that it is a fast, easy and light strategy game.

Really enjoy this game, and want to give it a 9, but haven't played it enough.  I have only played it 3 time so far, but love the mechanics.  This game feels like there are 2 mini-games included.  You first walk down Plymouth street to prepare for your voyage, and then you set sail and conquest or collect goods.  Would love to be able to play this more often.

3-14-14: I really like this game thus far, even though I've only really played it as a 2 player (BGG user variant) and one round of a 4 player game.

It's not nearly as complicated as it looks. Lots of choices, and with only three full rounds you can play a game fairly quickly (1-2 hours) for a medium-to-slightly-heavy Euro. I do wish you could carry over supplies from one expedition to the next, but looking forward to playing this one again all the way through with a full set of players.

UPDATE 7-28-14: Played a full version of it with 4 players the other day and confirms everything I liked about it. Bumped up to a 9.

UPDATE 2-13-15: Finally bumped it all the way to a 10. I think it is an excellently designed game and always like to play it.

RATING: 7
1 plays / 5 players

LIKE: Beautiful presentation, great art. There is enough player interaction to keep it tense, I like the pressure put on each player to skip ahead to grab a key placement, such as upgrading ships. I really enjoyed the numbered token placement in the sailing phase, it felt very interactive.

DISLIKE: There is no round-to-round carryover except trade goods, which means no engine building, and could get repetitive at lower player counts. Also, the board is rather large, but luckily player boards have a small footprint. Could be played a bit mean for some, because players can purposely block each other for critical points.

OVERALL: A solid game with enough players. At 5 players it seemed busy enough to keep everyone guessing who may be doing what and weighing their options. The rounds were quick, and the three rounds did not feel repetitive. Almost a gateway game, but a few too many rules.

RATING: 6.5
Solid worker placement game. The bluffing/outguessing your opponents aspect plays a significant factor, which, depending on how good you are at reading your opponents and with what degree of predictability they are playing, can be either an element of skill or of luck.

+Excellent component quality.
+Interesting combination of mechanics.
+Strong thematic connection.
+Straight forward rules set.

-Sailing disc placement can be something of a crap shoot.

The fact that the game is resetted and replayed 3 times make it easier on beginers but could be less appealing for those who enjoy long term planning.

RATING: 7
Initial thoughts: 

- It needs to be played with at least 4 players as there is a fair amount of space to earn points with less and therefore less tension

- I like the "biding" on resources phase as most of the decision making lies there but again, with less players, there are resources enough for everyone

- Beautiful components, very pretty game

- Varied ways to earn points so no clear path to victory which is good, but also leads to less tension imo

RATING: 7
Fun worker placement game with blind bidding. Terrific art and good decisions throughout.  Played pretty quickly, even though the setup and explanation was lengthy.  Strangely, with a game (and box) this big, I expected some measure of "progression," but really, it was a brand new game at the start of each round.  The only persistence was the goods tiles and points...minor areas.  No engine building.  Still, a well-designed game, but I may not run out to buy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Excellent game!  The pre-voyage preparation part is probably my favorite element due to the variability and opportunity cost balance.  The voyage portion is a nice resolution mechanic.  Plays pretty fast for the punch.  Absolutely excellent production!  Beautiful bits!  Strongly recommend you give this one a go.

My only play so far is with 3.  I'd like to see it at 4 and 5 - I suspect the game will get a bit tighter and better.

Has the potential to improve in rating but I'm a little concerned that the only true variance is in the pre-voyage preparation phase.  The second part, resolution, feels a little thin to me though it isn't actually thin (there are still plenty of meaningful choices to be made, it's just that they can be severely constrained by the pre-voyage part).

RATING: 7
1st play: Well designed pirate game. I enjoyed the shopping mechanic, the one way street forces choices between jumping ahead to great spots vs taking it slow and spending all your purchase disks. Out on the map, a good spread of places to pillage and plunder. I know it's not technically a pirate game, but it was fun and played fast.

2nd play: I enjoyed it the second time. I wish there was contention for the sailing locations, which means it plays better with 5 than 4. Not bad with 4 just better with 5. Solid games.

RATING: 7.5
First the impression on the components: wow, very beautiful and well done components, very beautiful art. Second the mechanic: a very good worker placement that tries to put you in a way to priorize the actions by jumping of other actions, does it worth it? That's what players must judge. The second part of the game is tracing the rotes, you just cannot ignore the goods for trade, you just cannot ignore the fights against strongholds, corsairs and spanish cities, but you cannot dream to high, you must travel safety even when you face battles bigger than you thought. The game plays very well, you basicly repeat the game 3 times and see what was the best score, but it is fast and with enough depth.

I just don't get the comparisons with Endeavor. 

It's a highly themed game for a Euro; nothing at all innovative about it, but a heck of a lot of fun! Each individual part of the game (including the theme!) is very good, but other games handle each individual part better than Francis Drake. HOWEVER, it is the sum of the very good parts that end up making Francis Drake an excellent whole game! You see, there is nothing in Francis Drake that I can find fault with, which is an extreme rarity in a game. Hence, my rating of 9. No spiffy innovations here, but it's the splendid and flawless blending of the tried-and-true that make it so great.

The only negative I have is for the lack of player aids; and Francis Drake definitely needs them! The components are wondrous; but just a little less of snazzy components would be more than made up for by player aids.

Dear Future David: With a $65 base pledge and $40 shipping on Kickstarter, there's no way to rationalize this purchase now. Keep an eye out for this one, post release. The artwork is lush, the play looks interesting and varied, but it's Plymouth Harbour as the home base that seals the deal.

A great worker placement game played on two fronts: the resource acquisition track and the scoring map.  4 players is superior to 3, but 3 is still fun.  The components are incredible and actually add to the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's got a beautiful board and some neat ideas. But the balance is somewhat wacky. There are supposedly multiple routes to victory, but some routes are objectively superior to the others. It will quickly become obvious who managed to get the "best" momentum. At that point, there's not much players can do. It largely simulates running a race.

And honestly, I feel like Francis Drake doesn't have very much re-playability. Each session feels pretty similar to the last--a race I've run before. I still think it's good from time to time, but it's a couple steps away from really being great.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Longer game, which is a little depressing considering it is only three voyages long. It has a solid "tokaido" resource gather, followed by an interesting priority placement phase. Successfully anticipating the other players will yield better rewards in the resolution phase. The ability to interact with other players passively is great and feels more involved than it really is, which is what this game really wanted to get to.

Francis Drake's one-way Plymouth Street is a mechanism we first saw in Knizia's Tutankhamen.  It makes as little thematic sense here as in a game about collecting antiquities.  Why can't I go back to the tavern and how, exactly, am I buying the right to deploy Spanish soldiers on another continent?  Set such quibbles aside and there are some enjoyably angsty choices around sprinting ahead to get that essential resource.   

By contrast, the second half of each round, in which the resources collected in Plymouth are turned into victory points, is rather less interesting. Again, there are thematic bum notes. There is no sense of dramatic sea battles with  Spanish galleons.  Simply discard as many black cubes as it has cannons and the galleon is sunk. 

Unused resources are swept away between rounds, so we are effectively repeating the first round twice more.  I didn't find that objectionable in itself, but the game does run long for what it is.  

Production quality is nothing less than lavish.  The artwork is nicely done too. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
would rather play Egezia, which is like the interesting half of this game; sailing your ships has too much blind-bidding-like luck for me. Also since resources don't carry over, rewards very careful resource counting, leading to AP.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Nice medium weight eurogame with great production values, clean rules and fast gameplay. In the first phase of the game players prepare themselves for attacking the Spanish colonies. This first phase uses a variation of the classic worker placement mechanic, as players gather crew,cannons and upgrade their ships. After all players are ready, the attacking phase begins. That part of the game has a bit of bluff and deduction. All in all an enjoyable eurogame but it gets a bit repetitive after a while.

This is a very good game. You supply your ship as to your strategy and then decide where to go, depending on fuel available. The movement mechanic on the supply track (taken from Egizia) works well, as does the revealing of the discs, so nobody is certain that they have achieved all that the wanted to. Good fun.

RATING: 8
This is a well designed, nicely thematic game which played quite well with 5 players, and it can be hard to find a well designed euro that plays well with 5 (Medici, Hermagor & Santiago come to mind).

Francis Drake featured enjoyable decision making both in getting supplies using the worker placement mechanic, and sailing to Spanish towns, forts, galleons, or trading areas, using the hidden number placement mechanic.  Fun to play around with, and fun to see the results.  The theme, art and components are strong.

The one concern I might have with Francis Drake is replayability, as it does fundamentally feature a finite number of things (4) you can do with your provisions.  As such, there is a possible solvability issue.  Nevertheless, the player interactivity through the two central mechanics is likely to be, presumably, the primary determinant of game results among top players, and...produce ample number of fun plays with this game.

Another set of Euro mechanics chewed up, spat out and re-themed.  A decent game in the Euro class but has too much luck for me to consider a great. Doesn't match Caylus in any department. I think I prefer Age of Empires 3 over this too. I'd have to play them both a few more times to really decide.

I really like this game.  3 phases - Prepare your Caribbean cruise by procuring resources, men, trade goods and cannons - then you plan the cruise using hidden movement and finally you execute by raiding towns, attacking forts, plundering galleons and trading for exotic goods.  There is a mild screw your neighbor aspect as only the first at a place gets the special prize.  Great production value for this game - the game box is outstanding.

Unsual kickstarter hype material. Looks nice enough and the idea of two alternating phases fit the theme, but the lack of growth and interesting interaction make the 2nd and 3rd round quite boring.

RATING: 7
would be an exceptional title in light of other essen 2013 ones, but the fact that starting turn order is extremely important and quite difficult to change makes it almost game-breaking that there isn't any handicap given to players farther up the the order chain. (1 canon to last player only is more of an insult than making up for the turn order placement)

Make three voyages after preparing your ship : seems quite simple, isn't it. Well, it is simple after all, because gameplay is clear and structured. So, although the game isn't difficult the placement of the mission discs is an exiting part of the game. It's a mix of counting and bluffing and hoping. I liked it a lot while playing and that's the reason of playing games. And of course, an Eagle game is always too big but evenso nice.

First off, the game has beautiful components and the board has very good artwork. This is one of the better "pirate" games out there. Though, you don't have to go the pirate route. There are two or three viable strategies to pursue. Merchant, pirate, a little of both as well as whether you want to go heavy military and what types of targets you are wanting to attack. The worker placement phase works well as you supply your ship. Interesting decisions to be made. Finally, the final phase of each year has a nice bit of "bluffing" between the players. My only issue is it feels a bit repetitive each year. You are basically doing the same thing. A solid game for the price.

First play on International Tabletop Day 2014, explains more complex than it actually is, but there is a lot going on and it is presented in a very easy to manage way, Kudos there!

I liked it a good amount.  It was a lot faster than I expected.  Getting what you need in the provision round works well, especially when all the spots are randomized.  Reminded me of Egizia and In the Year of the Dragon in that aspect.  Like someone said, five is probably the sweet spot as it will become pretty tense in what you can get and what route you are going to go with for points.  The game looks great (the copy I played on had the ships painted, wow!) and I'm glad it is in our group's collection.

An okay game of set collection and blind-bidding with a race for turn order that is linked to resource collection.  The faster you move through the resource/voyage preparation track, the earlier your turn order (and tie-breaking priority) but the fewer resources or variety of them you will have amassed for your pirate's voyage.  There are only 3 round to the game, and the scoring system encourages/rewards balanced play by giving a hefty bonus to players who won all three types of battles (town, fort and pirate ship battles) on a given round.  Many aspects of the game seem to be well-balanced in terms of catch up mechanisms, limited actions, tough choices, and points assigned for the sets and individual battles.  The number of resources available and the barrel-limited movement also feels balanced.  That said, I really didn't like the blind-bidding for priority to do battles.  Also, I dislike the uncertainty of resources needed (and lack of wild resources to mitigate this) and the "spoilage" or resetting of all resources except goods tokens after each round.  Planning and saving are nigh impossible, and this makes the game very tactical/situational and not fun for me, even though it fits with the theme of voyaging into the unknown, etc.  I also felt the number of trade good cubes (6) available per round was just a little too small to encourage competition for trade goods, especially when could with the fact you only get 4 (maybe 5) actions per turn.  My opinion on this may change with subsequent plays and experience because maybe with 5p you just need to rush for turn order and get very focused on trade goods for 1-2 of the 3 rounds.

RATING: 8
Worker placement with several twists. Phase one of the game involves the collection of the various resources needed to succeed in the exploration phase of the game (guns, crew, supplies, type of ship, trade goods, etc); then, in phase two, the players set off to explore the new world to trade, conquer and exploit gathering rewards which later translate into VPs. You place disks indicating what the desired preparation resource is that you want as you advance along a track (phase one) or where your desired location is to be (phase two). The way each of the phases is resolved and the way the turn order for each phase is regulated is somewhat unique and, all in all, the number of decision points is kept quite high.

In the exploration phase you can choose at least four possible destinations all requiring different combinations of resources for success, so until you become quite familiar with the game the array of computations seems a bit daunting. Everything you have collected by way of preparation goes away at the end of each expedition round so if you've miscalculated you're hooped. Expect to do that a lot at first.

Not a bad game, if a bit repetitive as you do the preparation and expedition phases three times each accumulating VPs as you go (there are bonuses at the end however). The production values are top notch and it is a very pretty game with excellent bits.  I would play again but of games of this type I think I still prefer Merchants and Marauders.

Love the components and the theme and the shopping at the start of each round.  That's all fantastic.  I'm not quite sure why, but the second half of each round doesn't quite deliver as much as I'd hoped, maybe it's the lack of direct conflict.  I love the concept and the atmosphere though.  

I'd love to see more interesting expansions as well.  I feel there is a great base of a game here, and it could really be buoyed by interesting expansions which give new treasures and surprises to the players.

Great theme and incredible production.  The game has 2 parts, the provisioning of your expedition and then its resolution.  I enjoyed both parts and the interaction between the players as they compete for the best supplies and targets.  It was very surprising at how quick the game plays.  With 4 new players we were done in under an hour and a half and that included a rules explanation.

This really works best with 5p.

May be the best medium weight game I own. The opening phase of selecting equipment and people down the 'boardwalk' is tense, and important for the following exploration phase. I think this is the best of the few games (Glen More, Egizia) that implements this neat mechanic. The 'blind bidding' in the second phase to secure valuable locations requires careful planning, since it is easy to loose track of your ability to complete those missions if you have not provisioned yourself adequately during phase one (resource/equipment collection). UPDATE: Used the variable location setup for rounds 2 and 3, providing a neat twist on managing the resource/people collection at the boardwalk. Plays well with four or five players.

The chrome is beyond the dreams of every bit *hore. It's gorgeous on the surface, but the parts have been used before through and through. Three 1-night stands, as one round has nothing to do with the previous.

As for the game itself, the first half of each round is reminiscent of Egizia which is the fun part of the game. However, the sailing half is controlled by randomness of blind order-bidding, which influences which gems you get. And the acquisition of gems is the margin of victory in this game.

This doesn't seem to have different pathways to victory. You have to conquer each of the 3 types for 10 VPs every round. You can't just trade as a viable strategy. Overall, nothing new. And you're at the mercy of what the admiral and governor have placed as to whether your conquests are successful or not.

The production is gorgeous. Worth owning for the beauty alone.

As both a pirate fan and a British History fan, I was very drawn to the theme of this game but I didn't expect to like it half as much as I do. The Glen More-style action selection phase is the centerpiece of the game, presenting players with very tough choices that vary from turn to turn, especially with the random set-up. Resources are so scarce that you will necessarily be limited as to what you can do each turn, and finding the right niche to succeed within those limits is a challenge. 

I do think that turn order during the WP phase is a little too game changing, giving the first player far more of an advantage than they should have (especially if they are only a couple of points behind the next player). The board and bits are beautiful, and the game is heavy enough to be interesting, but light and short enough to avoid overstaying its welcome. The perfect balance for a light/medium-weight Euro.

1/19/15: Great worker placement/set collection game with outstanding quality components.  Only issue is that base game doesn't scale smoothly below 4 players. (Mechanic to block available locations on the Spanish Main during the sailing phase of turns, similar to the tokens/chits used in Alien Frontiers for lower player counts).  Should be addressed somewhat in the upcoming boxed expansion. (8.0)

2/2/17: 2 years on and I now see some of the limitations of the game.  I still enjoy owning it,  but it has been surpassed by better designs for me. (7.5)

Essen 2013: Rating based on a demo of the first third of the game.  I was impressed and may well have bought a copy despite the steep price (60 Euros) if I had room to take home another (very) big box game.  The fact that the other two thirds of the game repeat the same structure as what we played gives me some confidence about my rating, other than a slight concern about too much repetition.

The bluffing can be fun- potentially. So far, nobody has done it to the extent that I'd call it fun. I do like the "Plymouth Harbor" bit. Becomes boring because it forces you to do everything (same as everybody) to stay competitive. Varied strategies are not rewarded.

RATING: 5.4
A game that feels like Egizia meets Ys...a can't-go-back-once-you-go-forward resource track meets a competitive blind bid for resource to victory point conversion. There are things to like...graphically, it is gorgeous, if not over-produced (the barrels and goods serve absolutely no purpose...several columns on a board could have been used to track these items and save on the fiddliness)...The resource track that is randomized every round is always a great mechanic...the reward for diversifying when sailing coupled with the hidden gem collection adds tension.  However, there were just as many things not to like.  First, you are essentially playing a game in 3 identical parts, like a card game with 3 hands.  The game almost totally resets itself between rounds, but nothing on the board changes between rounds to vary what you need to collect from the resource track.  The track randomization makes acquiring the resources different, but you never feel that what you are collecting based on a given round really changes...you want 4-6 crew, 4-6 guns, 1-2 trade goods, 3-4 barrels, an upgraded ship and a special character or two.  Perhaps acquiring these things wasn't brutal enough.  Some items seemed special but were really trade offs for other items. For instance, you could move to take 3 guns, or take the special character that allows you to ignore fort guns, or you could take the special character that allowed you to switch the hidden ship markers on the board which would likely save you 3 guns.  These are 3 ways of saying the same thing, aren't they?  Thus, I always took the one that kept me just ahead of the pack, because finishing first and breaking ties seemed way better than splitting hairs on the resource track.

I think this argument underscores why Feld's games are getting a lot of discussion now is because the availability of items and the punishment for not acquiring certain items is constantly changing in his games.  In Francis Drake, you never say "In this round, I only need 1 trade good but 10 guns because the pirates are going to be crazy" or "Indigo is only available this round so I want to make sure I acquire this many trade goods and possibly this special character."  Instead, indigo is available every round and the number of guns that will be encountered is more or less the same every round.  

The game had no long term planning because of the round reset. In addition, the sailing was supposed to feel like you were plotting a course with your numbered blind bidding tokens, but thematically, it was more mechanical and just downright wonky.  To make a long story short, I found it quite boring compared to other resource/point salad games.  My thinking on Peter Hawes games has not improved. Personally, if you like Francis Drake's mechanics, but not the overall play, track down either Egizia or Glen More, and Ys.  They are a lot better at distilling these mechanics down to a better gaming experience.

Not bad. Two phase game where you gather resources in phase one, and then execute the actions in phase 2. The resource gathering uses the Egizia mechanic where you can't go backwards on the resource track. This is a neat mechanic and works just as well here as in Egizia. It's tough managing getting a lot vs getting stuff you really want/need. 
There is the familiar kickstarter feeling of the game feeling under developed, and clunky in some places. Pretty good though.

RATING: 6.5
This game got a lot of hype, and initial thoughts on the gameplay sounded good, so when I got a chance to play it, I took it. I ended up playing it twice, and to be honest I wouldn’t mind if I didn’t get to play it again. Why? Mainly because the gameplay is too simplistic and the game feels very similar when playing the three rounds the game takes… There is almost no difference between the rounds, so I have to admit that I am a little underwhelmed. Nice production quality doesn’t equal a good game, and it doesn’t make up for a lack of good gameplay mechanics…

I do like the first part of the game where you choose the stuff you need for the second phase. The Egizia-mechanism where you cannot go back once you’ve taken an action further ahead is brilliant in my opinion. I like how you need to stack up on various resources which then determine if you’re going for cities, galleons, forts, trade goods or a bit of everything. And, of course, almost of highest importance, how far your ships are able to move! This is a pretty neat mechanic; you need between 1 and 4 barrels in order for your ship to be able to move to region 1, 2, 3 or 4. The special character cards are also a big deal in the game as they give you the power of doing various things, and some of them are really strong. But, alas, after this exciting first phase in the first round, the second phase begins which is definitely more boring and random. 

In this phase you place your tokens face-down and hope that you’ll not get screwed. But that you will be… In one of our games it happened quite a lot, and it sucks so much if you place the same token but is later in turnorder (I know you can somewhat plan for this in phase 1, but still). Honestly it’s a little lame that you can be screwed if you happen to lose to the tie-breaker (the order in which your ship is ready for the voyage); the first player will then get, i.e., 1 point + a gold = 5 points, while the latter player gets 1 point = 5 times less… This just rubs me the wrong way! You can “bluff” about where to put your discs, but there is no way to tell, and I think the randomness kills the first phase for me. You spend a lot of time doing something, and then you can get blocked big time.

Besides the gameplay, the components are beautiful. The glass tokens, the treasure chests, the plastic ships etc., but on the other hand it’s weird that they chose to make about half of the items awesome and the rest generic cubes… Cubes in various colors symbolize crew, cannons and trade goods, while barrels are, well, big plastic barrels which look very weird sitting next to your bunch of cubes... Odd.
I played with 4 and 5 players and liked 5 the best. 4 is okay too, and I definitely think 3 would be too boring as there would be no tense competition and fight over the spots on the track as well as where you place your secret tokens.
But, really, my main criticism towards Francis Drake is that it feels boring after the second round when you have to do it all over for the third time and that the second phase is a little too random and tthat you can be screwed too much.

After playing this more The game is feeling repetitive with the 3 rounds. I like the different characters and how they are lined differently each time making each round different but each round is essentially the same. I really wish there was a little something more that tied the entire game together. The components are amazing in this game,looks visually appealing. The game is much better with more players making the game more competitive for spots. I still like it but not something I want to play all the time.

I liked the interplay between scoring points and going first (like Power Grid) but also that you wipe your resources out between rounds, starting fresh each round (no engine building).  You can try and bank some points in your chest or trade goods for a turn order advantage, but mostly you are trying to maximize your points each round. The rest of the game is mostly collecting cubes with workers and then spending them, with a little blind bidding thrown in.  

The worker placement on the street was a refreshing mechanic in that you can't place your next worker behind your most recently placed worker, which pushes you towards the end of the road.  I can see rushing ahead early, keeping pace and taking what comes, or staying behind playing mop up all being sound strategies.  It seemed to me the Golden Hind was over powered, giving you one extra action.  The Golden Hind was so powerful that I wonder why the Drake requires 2 workers while this action was only one.  

A bonus 1/2 point for how awesome the chests are and the sound the gems make when you plunk them into your hidden hoarde.  Truly a wonderful asthetic to a good game.

-Would like to play again.

Francis Drake had been a game on my radar screen as wanting to try, largely because of the Egizia "choose actions down the river" mechanic. But I was also hesitant about a game that largely reset for three rounds.

Now having played it, I was pretty impressed. The reset between rounds really didn't bother me, as the collection of goods do persist throughout the game and are very tight and tough to collect. The 2nd half of a round actually has some interesting decisions as well, as players maneuver against each other to get the most points and rewards from the different map locations.

Overall a solid design.  I totally misplayed my first game, overestimating goods collection and underestimating the other aspects of point gathering. I'd like to try it again.

Don't get tripped up by the theme; this game is only slightly more a swashbuckling high-seas adventure than Caylus is a game of Middle Ages siege warfare. This game is Logistics Consultants Of The Spanish Main.

If you've already mentally checked out of the mention of Caylus, you're not wrong to do so. For the rest of us, this does transcend the morass of yet-another-goddamned-worker-placement on a couple of scores, integrating a couple of clever tiny races within the game.

Imagine a popular buffet restaurant of uneven quality -- move snappily down the line and you get the choice morsels of tandoori chicken and fresh naan out of the kitchen, but the crowd is massing behind you, so you can't go back if you've decided you wanted a bit of chana masala after all. Alternately you could start by making you salad just right and watch in despair as your fellow diners jump the queue and do for the hot food stations what Genghis Khan did for China. In a nutshell, that's what drives Francis Drake. The worker placement aspect is a one-way buffet line -- once you've taken an action, all spaces prior to it in line are off limits. It's clever, it balances the game rather nicely, and it works in an organic manner.

Even though the bulk of the game really is a pretty generic Euro cube-pusher, the clever bits do move it above the mundane. I'm glad I played and would probably enjoy a few more cracks at it. But I'm also glad that someone else bought it and has to deal with the question of where to put that big-ass box, etc. If you follow me.

For me this one felt a bit too repetitive. It also lacks any variance in potential winning strategies; you need to do a bit of everything except for the trading-set collection bit which I suspect can be all but ignored without any detriment to your score. I've only played one 3-player game, but this just doesn't feel like it's been fully balanced and play-tested. (Seriously, why is Cartagena worth so many points?) While I wouldn't put myself down as a keen Eurogamer, I can generally recognise a good game, even if it isn't to my tastes; I struggle to see what wows some people about this game. Well, the production is of course quite notable (and is arguably over-produced, pushing it into a price bracket the game play just doesn't fulfill). Based on 1 play.

There are two parts:
1) Worker placement to collect junk for your voyage. The hitch is that the spaces are sequential, and you can only move forward (a la Egizia).
2) Hidden disc placement, a la Aladdin's Dragons, Ys, etc. The values on the discs are the order they're resolved, and the order matters because it's first-come-first-served to the goodies at each space.

I like part 1 more than part 2. But I'm not sure about the total package. It's really the same game played three times in a row. There's only a tiny thread connecting the three rounds, each of which plays like a full game, but a short one, so do it three times.

It's a rare game that manages to feel stale on the first play through.  

Francis Drake has three rounds, and very little carries over between them.  Thus, you're essentially playing the same game three separate times.  When, somewhere around the 90-minute mark, you find yourself doing the exact same things you did in the opening minutes of the game, a mild sense of despair sets in.  Francis Drake has no real progression and no rising action.  Just stuff to do, which you do, and several hours later you're done.

The productions values are incredible, and the rubber boats in particular are a delight.  But I have no desire to play this again.

Based on 1 play, but i don't think my rating will increase with more plays. The theme is great and together with the great looks got me into buying this game. Unfortunately the underlying mechanics are dry as a desert.
Its all about optimizing your actions. There is no tension as you attack a spanish galleon or city. The only question is if you will be in time to score some vp.
I can see how other people might like it, but for me Francis Drake is a disappointment. No exciting voyages in the Carribean, no memerorable battles. Just scraping vp as efficiently as possible from across the board.

Francis Drake is a fun strategy game with a good connection to the theme. 

The game is overproduced, as there are many unnecessary components, such as the supply barrels, player boards and supply board. Otherwise, the board is nicely done with a great map and the wooden components and jewels are a nice touch. 

The game has a sort of Caylus feel in that you place "workers" along a path to gain abilities and collect resources in order to later use those abilities and resources to gain VPs. The "road" is used similarly to the river in Egizia in that a player may not place further up the road from his last placement. Unlike Caylus, there is a fair amount of randomness in that there are several locations on the board where you don't know how many cannons or crew are needed to defeat it until time to execute the action (but, there is a special ability during the worker placement phase that can eliminate this for one player each turn). 

The second phase of each turn is where players "sail" the Caribbean in order to do several types of actions, all of which earn VPs: trade materials for goods (set collection), attack towns, forts and cities, and finally attacking other NPC ships. Attacking land areas requires crew and possibly some cannons. Attacking NPC ships requires an upgraded ship to a Galleon and some cannons. Resources are not saved from turn to turn, but are discarded. This seems to be a point of criticism, but it doesn't bother me, even if it isn't thematic.

During this action phase, there is a sort of bidding system for the order of actions. Only two actions in each spot on the map can be performed by players. So, it is possible for a player to be outbid and not get to do the action, or do it for less of a return. Also, a player might not have the required crew or cannon to attack successfully, in which case the action is not completed. 

A fairly simple game with a lot of strategy.

[August 2017 - 7.6]
Francis Drake is a good intro-to-medium-weight game that relies mostly on the mechanic of programming -- fill up your ship with the right amount of supplies to then maximize point scoring in the second half as your ship sails the Caribbean. 

While supplies are always tight in the first half of the game, I wouldn't say there are a lot of tough decisions -- usually, it's pretty obvious which supply to get next, depending where you are. Still, I enjoy the rondel-like play here.

The second half of the game is mostly a guessing game on where you think your opponents placed priority, but beyond turn order for that location, the placements lack any further interaction, versus something like the priority placements in Game of Thrones. After that, it's just playing through the round, and revealing some hidden elements to see if you supplied right.

Perhaps adding some abilities to steal or gain supplies along the voyage would spice things up a little? Also, the game suffers from having to essentially reset your board each round (only keeping commodities) meaning there's no sense of building up an engine and gameplay starts to feel repetitive.

All that being said, at its intro-to-medium-weight level, it's a good game, especially with it's stellar components and themeing.

If you're looking for some similar mechanics, but more interaction, variability, and complexity try Lancaster or Wallenstein.

I love the preparation phase of the game, just as much as I loved it when it was called Egizia.  The second phase is much less interesting, but it has a few nice moments.  The fact that the game completely wipes between rounds and there's absolutely no arc to it, though, brings the whole affair down a couple pegs.  Even though there are a few small differences, one round felt very much like another, to the point where when I was done I felt like I'd played the game three times in a row, and was probably done with it.

RATING: 6.5
Clever game but it is fairly dry and the engagement with the theme is slim - never has storming a fortress/town or capturing a Spanish galleon felt as lacking in drama. For a Euro it does have a decent amount of interaction and there are a lot of 'thinky' calculation, resource allocation/acquisition decisions to be made.

A pretty good game of it's type though and it is clever and I would play again but don't need to own - avoid playing with the heavily AP prone.

I really like the interaction between the shopping and the bluffing aspect of the sailing part of the game.  The unofficial-official variant is nice since two player is our most common number for gaming, but I think the game really shines at the four to five player mark when arrival order becomes something that can make or break turn or game.

RATING: 7
Reminds me a lot of Egizia.  You take an action on the track...you cannot go backwards and take an action earlier on the track...only forward.  FD has a phase 2 where you can score some points by completing some or all 3 objectives.  If you complete them first, score more points via gem collection.  The downside is there are some tiles that seem way too overpowered where if they come out early in the track, it becomes too advantageous for the start player (which is random on turn1).  Especially that tile that gives you the extra ship/action in phase 2.  That needs to not be included in the first 7 tiles.  Absent of that, this game deserves more play!

This is an excellent game with two distinct parts to it. The first half is worker placement the other half is A turn order bidding kind of mechanism. It is a tense game. The board and components are absolutely stellar. Lots of fun and quite easy to learn.

RATING: 7
Players are English privateers, who spend three seasons plundering the Caribbean for treasure and trade goods.  Each season sees the players walking in Egizia fashion down Plymouth Street, sweeping up supplies for their upcoming voyage.  When all players have provisioned, players secretly deploy their mission chits into the Caribbean, indicating where they are heading and in what order they will be doing so.  Targets include Spanish cities, treasure ships, trade centers and so on.  There are limited opportunities in each space so players may miss out if they are late to the party.  Most victory points after three seasons win the game.

Fun game, with amazingly nice production.  If the game has a fault, it is essentially three identical games bolted together, with little overlap apart from some gradual trade good accrual.  Still, easy to pick up and play, and certainly easy on the eyes.

Wow, amazing production quality on this game.  However, I am still waiting for a great game that uses the excellent "one way worker placement road" mechanism.  To be sure, Francis Drake does a much better job with it than Egezia (which I give credit for inventing this mechanism), but still doesn't fully do it justice. 

I don't think the second half of the game scales well to fewer players.  Even with a full boat, I'm not sure about the programmed order mechanism used for scoring in a game of this weight.  I think that can work very well in a lighter game (e.g. Caribbean), but I'm not sure it is aligned with the tensely tactical worker-placement phase of the game.

Acquired 12/2015 in trade. 
Combination of worker placement (prep) and action selection with a deduction/bluffing angle. Played several times with the 2p variant and it works wonderfully.

Only really shines with 4-5p. Huge game box makes it difficult to set up a game away from home.

Francis Drake is half of an amazing game, to lead into the other half of a good game. 

Each round starts with a traversal of the docks to prepare for your journey - the system at the docks is excellent: do you run through the docks to get to the valuable spot at the end, or take your time grabbing what you need earlier. This part completely trumps the oceanic voyages.

Definitely would like to see more of this mechanic in games (and more of this game!)

Simply marvelous.  Top 5 game for me after a play.  
The theme is one of the best I've played and is implemented seamlessly into the game.  The components are 1st class from the 3d treasure chests storing your gold, silver, and jewel loot to the massive board, and all the way to the storage in the box.

Has a similar feel to AOE III but is distinctly different mechanically and is split into 3 rounds of 2 phases = Prepare/load your ship & setting sail to conquer the Caribbean.  My favorite moment is the start of the round looking over the gulf and considering how I am going to spend my moments in Plymouth.  Tense, tactical, thematic and strategic... awesome.

The fact that this can be purchased for the same price as say a game like 7 wonders, settlers, or Small World is a massive bonus.

[b][ComponentsImpression][/b] Top notch components. Box is large, but that is to accommodate the large board and the amazing insert.

The ships are made from some sort of rubber. Much better choice than soft plastic.

There are plenty of cardboard pieces and they punched out from the frame smoothly. The cardboard pieces are thick and of high quality. 

Insert is excellent, it works and it's one of the best insert I've seen. They even provide a cover/lid for the whole insert to avoid spillage. 

They went the long mile and provide an extra set of stickers, extra cubes, extra tokens for Spanish troop and frigates and 5 replacement wooden discs.

Very beautiful components and I'm very pleased with everything.

[b][FirstPlayImpression1stSEPT2014][/b] Despite it's beauty, the game fell flat for me. Nothing innovative or new to me. It's a straight up equip your ship and send it to the Spanish main.

The buying phase is okay to me. Although the one-way-street mechanic sounds cool (think Egizia), it's quite boring actually. The choices seem obvious and you can't go wrong if you missed out on anything. There's always something else to go/do.

The sailing phase although sounds exciting, it's nothing fancy. Placing mission discs with the value face down do create some thoughts when planning your strategy, but other than than, it's nothing pretty. 

The rule where you replace your ship's figure on the harbor with the ghost ship token, so that when you're taking action you use the actual figure to set sail to your missions are completely unnecessary. We simply left our figures in the harbour, and just call out the sequence of all mission discs. Yes, it does make it thematic to use your ship to show that you sail from one destination to another, but it's completely pointless and fiddly.

Francis Drake disappoints me despite the 10/10 components rating. I wish it was better.

RATING: 7
Francis Drake is a good solid Euro with two parts to the game. Firstly you travel once around a circuit (Plymouth) stopping on action spaces.  This feels a little like Glen Moore: should you jump ahead to grab the one you really want?   But by doing so you take away the potential to do the actions you jump over...or do you wait and grab more actions but potentially lose the one you really really want?  These are the sort of agonising delicious decisions I like in a game.  After this part of the game has been done you travel with your ships on the map.  You rinse and repeat these two parts of the game three times.

There has been criticism that the three rinse & repeats in Francis Drake are too similar, that there is no progression.  I disagree, I found that things change a lot each time you travel through Plymouth as your aims for each of the three voyages are different, and so are your opponents.

A good game and one I would happily play again.

Drake is a pretty light game. Not a whole lot of deep strategy or plotting multiple turns/rounds ahead. There is minimal luck, which is nice, but the game is certainly very light on strategy.

The 3 rounds thing isn't my favorite concept either... you play 3 identical rounds that are pretty much not impacted by any other round.  I.E. Once you finish round one.... reset, line up and do it all over again... 2 more times. I like the feeling that you're progressing as you play through a game and this game doesn't really give that. 

The treasure chest for concealing the gems is pretty pointless as well. Since it is never a secret when you accumulate a gem, it just forces you to keep a mental note of everyone's score as you play through the game. 

The components are great and the game is beautiful and well-made. I really like some of the game play mechanics, but overall, I find it doesn't really engage my brain the same way other games might (even light-medium games like puerto rico or agricola).

RATING: 9
Francis Drake is a game that is played in 3 rounds, with each round broken into 2 phases: shopping and sailing.  In the first half, players go around the docks gathering supplies or visiting dignitaries to get what they need for their voyage to plunder the Spanish holdings in the Caribbean.  This is done in a fashion where you can only move forward down the street and cannot go back to a space that you previously skipped over.  Lots of tension as you have to guess what others might take, and what you really want to jump ahead to, and what you are willing to give up to do so.

Once the shopping phase is done, players set sail by placing their missions tokens face down with mission priorities 1 thru 4.  These tokens do not need to placed in numerical order, and outguessing/bluffing your opponents is key while keeping in mind what targets your resources allow you to successfully take.  When all of this is done the mission tokens are revealed and turns are taken by mission priority.  There is a lot of tension here as well since typically only the first 2 successful missions in any given area, whether it is raiding or trading, will score points.  Being the first success also gives bonus points.    

This is an excellent game with a TON of decisions to be made.  It can be a bit fiddly as there are many pieces to be reset each round, but it's not a big complaint.  This game also plays best with more players, since with the minimum 3 the competition during the sailing phase isn't as fierce.  The game is highly thematic, low on the luck factor, and moderate on player conflict (done by blocking spaces and competing for mission priority in locations).  There is also a good mix of ways to score, with set collection as well as hidden points.  The game is beautiful with excellent components, and most importantly, a lot of fun!  Highly recommended!

The good : 

- no downtime, everyone is engaged all the time - there are many small decisions you need to make during the game, but you better have an overall strategy as well or you'll lose. Update after a 5-player game : game scales well and still no downtime.

- easy to teach and explain, pretty streamlined game with a minimum of clunky exceptions.

- a 4-player game is done in 2 hours.

- most importantly : the gamegroup likes it - a lot.

The bad : 

- totally overproduced, making it a rather expensive game - 60 euro - but why then not go all the way ? Where's my little pirate crew ? my guns ? grey and black cubes .. yuck

As it's already lavish to start with, I've decided to go all out and pimp this game to the max and have ordered some 15mm pirates, guns and boats from Peter Pig.

Battling in very euro-ish form. Nice to play, though I'm not sure if it's good to concentrate on collecting the sets of goods at all. In our game of 4 players, 2 players tried that and they both left quite much back from the others. Conquering as much cities as possible and getting some bonuses about them would be the best way to play, with that collecting goods as a step option if there's nothing better available. Would need some more plays to figure out if it's really that way.

There is nothing new, but everything is served in so polished and gorgeous package now. Highly detailed plastic ships and big treasure chests as personal storages for the very edible-looking jewels are so cool. Game board is huge, maybe even too big as some symbols are so very tiny in the upper part of the board and they are hard to see from the other side of table.

Medium-weight worker placement game about British piracy in the Spanish Main.  

The next big box game from Eagle Games.  Components are [u]amazing[/u].  Good medium-weight game that isn't overly complex.  Very solid euro-style game that is surprisingly interactive and also very thematic - the designer has used Drake's history to shape some of the mechanics.  Unlike many euros, this doesn't rely on engine building, and each of the three rounds resets at start; this will limit replayability for some.  Replayability relies on shuffling location tiles in the worker placement phase, and the interaction evident through blind bidding style play of sailing phase.  While most tense with five, scales quite well; playable with 2 using: [thread=1035134][/thread]

Critical commentators state: 1. The three rounds are somewhat similar, because there's no long term engine-building; the blind bidding & hidden info also make it less calculable (which I like, because it's not a heavy game); 2. Tension from the blind bidding for destinations is lacking somewhat in 3-4 player games; 3. It's quite euro.  None of these are issues for me, I think it's sufficiently variable and engaging.

Francis Drake is a two-part game that captures the historical English pirate invasion of the Spanish Caribbean. The first part is all about anticipating your opponents' moves and choosing actions that will best set up your ship for success. The second part is choosing your spots to attack and hoping your planning plays out. It is a really solid Eurogame, but feels like it should be more "exciting" than it is. It is fun! But it feels like it is a good expansion away from being an 8+ rated game.

Initial rating a 7 but have upgraded because I realized one of its deficits is actually a benefit. The game is exactly the same thing three times over, no arc of development or anything. But that's fine! I realized that I always wish that I could play a game multiple times in a row so that I could employ things I learned in previous games and see how I might play better. This game offers that! You basically get to play a game three times in a row but it's a single game.

From the looks of the box and knowing NOTHING about this one I had assumed it was a sort of 4X game and I was really pleasantly surprised that this is a simple worker placement type affair with a sort of blind bidding push your luck type voyage phase.

Each of the three turns are split into two phases, stocking your ship and then undertaking your voyage. The stocking the ship aspect is really nice and reminiscent of egizia, and the voyage phase you blind bid for areas to interact with based upon the supplies you manage to acquire during the first phase. Ship and fort strengths have additional hidden tokens you you never know their exact strength, so there is a bid of push your luck to the game aswell.

I really enjoyed this one

This game had sat in the cupboard for 5 months before getting it to the table.  The issue was that it looked complicated (large board, lots of components and an overly complex rule book).  However, It's actually surprisingly simple to play and had everyone hooked.  
It's great fun wandering down the Plymouth street press ganging crew to join your next voyage, hoping to grab that elusive spot such as Francis Drake himself to try gain an advantage in terms of crew, Cannons, trade goods  and supplies.  Once equipped it's off to the Caribbean to plunder some Spanish galleons, towns and forts or simply peacefully trading with the natives on the Caribbean islands.

There initially appears to be several paths to victory but only time will tell, such as balanced (conquer + trade), trade only, or conquer only.  Of the two games we've played to date, balanced and trade strategies have won 1 each.


If i have a gripe then it's down to the component quality which has that "made in china" washed out linen look with sharp edges issue.  Also the gameboard is will not lie flat at all due to the manufacture method around the folds and is also quite warped.  It's a shame but then I kind of understand that to knock this up a quality notch would have added quite a bit to the price since there are a large number of components.  The plastic barrels and ships are very good btw!

Francis Drake met my expectations, which is a good thing. It doesn't introduce anything new to Euro gaming, but certainly balances out several known mechanics to make a tense game with room for forward planning.  It reminds me a lot of Egizia, where players must choose actions along a line, but cannot go back and choose action earlier down the line. This makes for competitive action selection! The planning phase and mission placement phase is really where the game is.  Unfortunately, the sailing phase is just a time to resolve all of the missions you have set out.  There is very little decision-making to be done during this phase, so it's mostly 90% resolving previous decisions, which makes the games pacing quite uneven.  It doesn't make it a bad game, but definitely removes the most interesting parts for about 10 minutes each round while things are resolved, making 1/3 of the entire game perfunctory.  But the issue doesn't take too much away from the good points, which are a solid worker placement system and a beautifully produced production.

Love the idea and mechanics of perusing through town to ready your ships for their voyages. The components are extremely nice & one of the nicest mapboards of the Caribbean area.

The exploration and battling is handled quickly and cleanly, not too exciting. This could get old if played too many times close together.

Pretty game to the point where you might find it overproduced.  The map, tokens, and tiles are all first rate --almost a showpiece game.
Regarding gameplay, it seems chaotic for this type of game, and the 3 rounds have almost nothing to do with each other. The hidden placement on voyages doesn't really fit traditional bluffing --it felt more like process of elimination and prioritizing (who can mess with you based on supplies and special abilities).  I love the Egizia mechanic, but this game didn't play as well as Egizia IMO. Mind you, the English rules for Egizia require a fair bit of patience, but once you're playing, the strategic experience is better.

game has nice components.
box art is nice, as is the insert - a game that has an insert that werks - what a concept!

I feel that after numerous plays the game may become stale, due to the lack of ports/objective areas. The supply selection phase (egizia) is randomized and may bring freshness and variety, but that mission phase is going to suffer.

We did play with the Montezuma's legacy and Spain's Revenge expacs - I think the game is BETTER with Spain's Revenge and those tiles SHOULD have been included with the base game. Montezuma's Legacy was ok, and I feel it didn't add much to the game.


I will purchase when it becomes avail (I played someone else's KS copy) and will play it happily - just not often.

Really liked this game.  Components are excellent, and deserve special mention.  They just didn't cheap out on anything.

The Euro, worker placement feel is there, but what I haven't seen before and makes it unique, is the "race" element as you go through the streets.  Do you jump ahead, and loose out on something you might need just adds a very different sort of a twist.

I think the two parts of the game work together very well, and the whole thing felt cohesive.  I imagine it best with the 5 that we played with as fighting for spaces is what gives it a lot of tension, but we were definitely pushing a little past 2 hours during that first play through.

Really nice strategic game. Exceptional components and art, really nice strategies. The key of the game is resource collection, using some one-circuit rondel worker placement mechanic, and going into missions using secret unit deployment (mission disks) - those play a huge role in game. And this all happens in decent short period of time.

I was slightly disappointed. It's a quite good game with top-notch components, but the worker placement and not least the "blind bidding" mechanics are okey, but not more. I had hoped for a more strategic game.

Not the best game in the world but pleasant. The limitation to 3 sets is good to have a not too long play time and to have fun playing it. A small flaw: the game setting is a bit long and the side of choice of the board side is not well specified.

Fracis Drake and Amerigo were about at the same time on Kickstarter. I decided to go with Amerigo as the theme was the same. However after having played both, Francis Drake is better as it is more involving, meaner, more tension. At the end of Amerigo 98% of all Islands will be built on. You have enough actions to do everything you need to (normally). In FD you have to balance more on how many actions you spend to get resources an how can I ensure to fulfill what I planned for this turn. FD is more thematic than Amerigo which is a typical Eurogame. I like the Action of the "Golden Hind" which is kind of reminiscent of the "first move / first build" action in Ago of Steam (= you do something before all other even if you're the last in player order).
If you like Age of Empires III, then you will probably love this game too.

A beautifully and well produced game with vibrant true colors (the wooden pieces are true red, orange, yellow, green, and blue), which is always endearing to me. I do not enjoy off-color tokens.

Standard worker placement and resource management game with some randomness for replayability. It's neither too tight nor too loose. Overall, however, I'm probably not compelled enough by the game to keep it. WP is not my favorite genre, so I'm sure this will find a good home.

The board and tiles are solid and although the iconography is somewhat overly-flourished, the placement of most items makes for clear transfer of information. The rulebook is reasonable clear.

RATING: 6
A beautiful and well-designed board puts players in charge of expeditions to the Caribbean. The first part has a push-your-luck drafting element, and the second part has a bluffing, victory point grab. Then the game resets and is repeated for two more expeditions.

Some complain that the reset and repeat of the expeditions kills the game, but I disagree. It would still be an interesting game if there were only one expedition, but that wouldn't allow you to learn from your mistakes or try alternate strategies.

I look forward to my next play of the game, but I'm not in a particular hurry for that to occur. I have some worry that the game might be played out in a relatively short amount of time.

Opinió després de una lectura de regles:
Eurogame de col·locació de treballadors i bluffing. Es juga en tres rondes; en cada una d'elles es fan tres fases: una col·locació de treballadors al estil Egizia que determina posteriorment l'ordre de la segona fase (el primer que acaba comença abans), una sel·lecció d'accions mitjançant discs amb valor númeric boca avall (similar al que es fa al Ys) i la resolució d'aquestes accions en el ordre que indiquen els discs, tenint en compte que hi ha un nombre limitat de vegades que es pot fer cada acció i que aquestes es resolen en l'ordre que marquen els discs.

La temàtica està totalment enganxada i la interacció que existeix és indirecte, al estil d'un eurogame.

No afegeix absolutament res nou a la meva ludoteca, vindria a substituir el Egizia, i no crec que el joc sigui el suficientment bò com per fer-ho... A més a més, és possible que resulti massa caòtic, al col·locar tothom els discs d'ordre boca avall... Un altre punt feble és que el joc es juga en tres fases totalment independents una de l'altre però en les que es fa exactament el mateix, es a dir, es repetir tres vegades el mateix.

Francis Drake is a smart, interactive medium weight Eurogame, with lots of theme, and it clocks along at a good clip to the finish.

The theme is based on the exploits of Drake and other English privateers against the Spanish garrisons and galleons of the Caribbean Sea.

Players take up resource spots on a common path which tests their planning, timing, and flexibility, preparing Frigates and Galleons for trade and battle in the New World.

Certain roles and resource spots allow players to better plan their New World venture, but gathering these takes time, and may leave other important resources which cannot be filled- there are many choices here, and it is easy to go out of port having forgotten your lunch!

Then in order of shipping out the players select missions within range of their ships, planning how best to use the resources gathered to garner prestige at the Court.

In order of arrival, players try to carry out their planned missions- if they can- and then sail to the next mission. They can also decide to cut short their journey, and get prestige for telling their tales first in England.

After all players finish a journey the game resets for another journey, a total of three rounds.

The first successful marauder at a location carries off gold, or silver, or jewels- these go into a casket and are not seen again until game end. Other prestige points are visible, but it is a canny player who can recall how much treasure a player has taken, which makes even the final reckoning interesting.

Beyond the terrific theme, and interactive blocking/bluffing play, there is also terrific artwork to enjoy, with molded ships in two sizes, cardboard caskets, glass stones for money and jewels, a sizeable board and lots of cardboard goodness.

I'm a little torn where to start this, but it's so much fun that I have to bump it up to 7.75 to start.

This is an enjoyable game to play and to look at, and players are involved in stocking ships, adventuring, or watching what other players choose (and when) all the time, keeping it fun for all involved.

It's expensive, but really worth it, and I think recaptures the strategy of Egizia and possibly improves on it.

There's definitely a strong relationship to Egizia--not just the "river" mechanic (you can go forward as far as you want, but never back), but also the rewards for doing many different things, even though it is more efficient to specialize. The turn order works a little like Vasco da Gama--players place numbered discs to determine in what order they will perform various actions.  The game is well-balanced and encourages thinking ahead in a way that I enjoy. I wish the graphic design were a little clearer and the box a lot smaller. (1 play)

Worker placement + bluffing. For me, it is another worker placement variation game. Based on worker placement mechanism, the game adds competitive action allowance with bluffing. In fact, the bluffing and action part reminds me the classic game, Aladdin's Dragon, a lot. The game, Francis Drake, is ok. And, the system works ok. It means that the game is a real-ok-game. In my opinion, Francis Drake is nothing very special. After the first play, I've felt the game is lack of freshness and absorptive power. Besides beautiful components, Francis Drake shows a real-ok-game.

Some of the game mechanics don't fit in with other game mechanics.  This makes the whole game feel messy and some rules force a false economy.  I especially like how you ship shrinks every round, and trade goods last longer than metal cannon balls.  it is a bit broken with less than 5 players.  A 3 player game is just to open and with 5 it might just be a little to tight with a lot of guessing and luck.

Francis Drake is an outstanding combination of two different types of games: one where players push their luck to try and load up with plenty of resources for their voyages and another one where players use those resources and try to outmaneuver and bluff their opponents as they sail around accomplishing feats to earn points. The game doesn't scale down well from the optimal five-player count, but those looking for an epic, stressful, and satisfying challenge shouldn't pass up a chance to play Francis Drake.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (March 2015)

From what many friends have told me about Francis Drake, I was expecting a lot. These days, most games from which I’m expecting a lot end up disappointing me, but not Francis Drake, I really enjoyed it and I plan to buy it in the future.

I generally don’t like this theme, but the gameplay is so good I can ignore it. 

The components are great as is the art, the game IS gorgeous. Francis Drake isn’t very complex rules wise but the decisions involved in it are very interesting (which action to take, do I have time to grab that tile?, How much barrels/crew/weapon do I need? Do I want the bigger ship?) because you can’t go back in the planning phase (a la Egizia), if you want to assure an action you can jump a lot of actions to grab it but in doing so you give up many other useful actions, it is very tense and interesting. The second phase is also very interesting, you try to anticipate your game buddies and try to plan to achieve your objectives. You have to fight for every point.

The playtime feels very short because you are constantly thinking about your next move, that is the downtime is very low.

Bottom line, the game has simple rules, but the gameplay offers very interesting decisions, it is tense and fun. I want to play again and I will buy it soon, sadly it is more expensive than most games, but the quality of the components and the gameplay make it a winner in my book.

RATING: 7
I wanted to like this better, but there are a couple flaws that hurt an otherwise elegant game.  Going first (early) into the street is important.  Since the only way to get there is to end your voyage early (not normally a good move) or to get to the docks first, you should try to get to the docks first.  This allows you to go first and take the better spots.  Since you take spots in player order, and not the one furthest back, there is nothing to offset that.  Allowing the one furthest back (as in Glen More) would probably help.  The other problem is how easy it is for someone to wreck your plans with random moves.  You and your closest competitor both are attacking different forts.  Someone else (or two someone else's) decide to attack the fort you are attacking and it decides the game.  Since a lot of decisions play that way, and there is no real way to mitigate that randomness, little political manuevering and harrassment can begin to get others to place where you aren't.  Ugh.  Other than that, it is a simple and elegant game.

Nicely produced euro with some interesting mechanisms, although I'm not sure how much strategy there is beyond make sure you get a fort, a city, a ship and if possible a trade good each round. The scores were pretty similar amongst those of us who did this, and it seemed the best approach. Could come down to small differences at the end, as it did with us.

The art is colourful and attractive, though the point score of each space could have stood out more - the small,  italicised numerals got lost amongst the background art.

RATING: 8.1
This game plays best with a full complement. Although the first half of the game scales well for lesser player counts the 2nd part dose not. 
The game feels like it is two games in one as the first half of a round consists of picking up meterials and favors ready for a voyage. The second part is using the resources and favors to voyage out in to attack ships, castles, ports and trade goods.
This is done with numbered discs to indicate the order you will visit the different locations and kept hidden so you don't quite what the other players are doing. The game is played over three rounds and the most points wins. 
This game has a lot of bluffing and head games, revealing the the order people visit locations and just beating some one to the gems can be very satisfying! And equally frustrating if you are on the receiving end :)
Might not hit the table all the time but a good game to pull out with five.

This game is exemplary of overproduction: unnecessary counters, plastic barrels and ships etc. Could've all been regular cubes or omitted, butt I guess all the high quality material does bring the theme to live, as does the beautiful board. Game mechanics make for a nice light game. I liked the one-way street worker placement part. All in all you play the same 'game' three times over three rounds. There is no variation in game play, so when you buy this game you pay a hefty amount of money for the components and end up with little re-playability. I do recommend it as an eye-catching game to bring new gamers into the hobby, if they don't mind a long game.

RATING: 6
Francis Drake, as a game, is very compartmentalized. You have a worker placement supply phase followed by a blind bid point-getting phase. You need the supplies to meet the requirements in order to bid on certain areas or win them and your supplies are spent when you win a bid, so the order of the bids is of consequence. These two phases are repeated twice more and the game ends. After a bidding phase, supplies not used are all lost, so you start each supply phase almost as if you are starting the game from scratch. The only thing kept are commodities, which score for sets at the end of the game, and treasures, which are hidden in chests and score at the end, although there is no set bonuses and - as it is all above board and calculable - unclear why they are hidden until the end. To disadvantage the forgetful, maybe?

I like how the worker placement supply phase works. It is a straight-line placement, like Egizia, where you can choose forward spaces and never go back. Between phases, the action spaces are shuffled so that they are in a different order. This is pretty cool and has you making different choices in each phase, but the bidding phases hardly change, with the exception of a supply action that allows a player to secretly alter a few values. The game is not particularly strategic because the slate keeps getting wiped clean. The bidding is not terribly exciting because what someone was able to pick up in the supply phase suggests a lot about what they are likely to shoot for in the blind bidding. Not a terrible game by any means, but its just not special or interesting enough to stand out.

Good solid mediumweight game.  Has one common mechanism with Egizia (collecting stuff with a limited number of action pawns via a one-way street) but that's only half the game, the rest comes in trying to outguess opponents on who is going where, which makes it a much more interesting game.  Multiple paths to victory (collecting trade goods versus a military route, or a combination of the two).  Probably best with 4 or 5.

RATING: 6
Seems like a cross between Egizia and ... Egizia, so similar comments and rating.  The basic premise is engaging - hire a crew, fit out the ship and go voyaging.  Basic resource management and set collection.  Lacks a narrative arc, which reduces the enjoyment - the three rounds are basically the same - compare Carson City, Endeavour and even Egizia itself - and truly I do not understand why the New World part could not include some aspect which developed it and thus made each round a bit different.  I don't know why, but Egizia takes 45 minutes and this takes 90 minutes but I seem to be doing more stuff in Egizia.  I really don't understand, thematically, why getting one of each of the four trading tiles gets so many more points than four of the same.  Also, the worker placement thing is weird thematically - you only get to walk down Plymouth Road ONCE?  Why?  Did Drake leave all his preparation to the last minute and only had time to run down the street once?  "Oh, we've had two years to prepare for this voyage and gosh, we've done no preparation at all!  Quick, round up some crew and stuff!"  Anyway, this is far batter than Hawes' Heads of State but not as good as War of the Roses.  Will happily play again but won't request.

Boring, boring, boring. Instead of a point salad this is a shit sandwich.  Half baked crap with random floating choice tiles so I can do the same thing three times in a row. In our 4 player game it felt for many players that a tide of terrible choices started to occur after one selection...aka either you skipped a ton of choices to get something good or you got nothing which allowed the last place player to always clean up in the end.  Points were randomly distributed on the board every round so at times having a ton of barrels meant nothing (I wonder if fans forget this step).  In fact my best rounds were when I had one or two barrels at most.  This game is an overproduced, undeveloped turd that smelled like mold when it was unpacked.  Damn I haven't hated a game experience this much in a long time and I played with people I really like so it wasn't the company that made the game stink.  Damn I am really starting to hate kickstarter spawned games.  I don't understand the hype: Wars of the roses was a superior game by this designer.

This has a beautiful looking board, although it is larger than most and needs a big table. You spend actions gathering, the men, cannons, and goods you need for trading and fighting. Then put out hidden priority markers on the spaces where you want to travel. It takes some time to go over the rules, but was fairly straight forward to play. There was some slight competition for spaces, but no pirating of the othe players which was fine by me. It was well themed and had a nice nautical feel.

---------------------------------------------------
I read the rules. This game looks fantastic!!
There are 3 voyages (rounds) in the game. Each voyage has two parts: planning then sailing. 

During planning you take turns placing workers to collect resources and special benefits (themed as personages, such as Francis Drake). The resources exist on cards that are thematically on a street. With each placement you must place further down the street than your previous placement (similar to Egizia). Each location has spots for several workers, earlier spots gaining better rewards. The speed at which you get through this phase determines the order of sailing.

In the sailing phase players take turns (in sailing order) placing a single mission disc onto a destination. Each player has 4 Mission discs numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4 and are placed face-down. There are 4 regions on the board, your ability to sail to them depends on how many supplies you collected. Each region has several destinations. Destinations are towns, forts, galleys, and trading ports. Once all players have placed their discs out face-down they are flipped up, the lowest two numbers will have the chance to activate this location ties are broken by sailing order. 

I won't go into the details of how you convert all the different resources to VP at each location and the different special abilities that add interesting wrinkles to what I've described. 

It just looks like an absolutely solid design with interesting decisions at every stage. The game is rich with player interaction. The Planning Phase is full of second guessing what people value and what you can afford to pass over. Trying to maximize the VPs you will get from sailing but having to plan for possible interference. The face-down placement in the Sailing Phase is psychological warfare at its best. It has programmable actions and bluffing all in one.

I won't know for sure until I play it how much I actually enjoy the manifestation of these rules, but I'm very excited at this point. It seems like a tight resource management game with many tough decision points, exactly my cup of tea.

I really liked it. It reminds me of Egizia (which I also love). Beautiful components. I really want the game but it doesn't play two player, and I don't think it'd be accessible to non gamers. Ironically it's really not that complex and everything really fits well together, but it does look very overwhelming to new players.

I love this game! It has tension all the time, the same as Agricola, but without the severe punishment. This one is a real winner in terms of components. It looks amazing, with all of the glass beads, big pieces, and beautiful art. My only gripe is with how the game resets nearly entirely after each voyage. Why is the only thing I can keep a perishable commodity? I can't keep my guns, but I can keep sugar? For five years? The other issue with the 3 rounds is that there isn't much to differentiate between the different rounds. While it lets you explore different actions, it still is very same round after round. I worry that may end up making the game feel old much faster than normal.

Blech. I like the idea of Egizia-style worker placement with variable action order, but the map portion of the game fell completely flat. There was almost no tension in that part of the game, but since it was blind bidding I probably would have been annoyed by the tension anyway. The dog of Sasquatch 2013

The game looks great on the table but I think it is a little overproduced.

The game is divided in two parts: a very pedestrian workerplacement where you get resources (very straight forward) and the adventure part where you sail for the new world (this is where the fun is).

I like it.

At first you might take it for a career simulation, but it's really very abstract, with a resource acquisition action draft being followed by blind bidding for resource matching opportunities to collect raw VPs, short-term VP sets and long-term VP sets. With more players there will be more competition for raids which should increase the chaos level. Replayability remains to be seen. You'd think they could have done something more to create an arc over the three rounds.

And oh boy is this overproduced. I can't fault the glass gems and the spare troop tokens are nice, but as for the rest:

* The player boards and the harbour board are unnecessary: they have no tracks or gauges, they're just a surface for things to rest on. Tables do that.

* The barrels could easily have been brown cubes, matching the other resources nicely, taking up less space and being less prone to being knocked around.

* The toy ships serve no function in the game even though the rules instruct you to move them around. They weren't custom-made for this game so I don't know if they're expensive, but they take up space and could really have been replaced with a single disc. Similarly the turn counter could have been just any token.

* The chests are not needed, but only arbitrarily serve to hide one of two types of trackable accumulated things. They take up a lot of space in the box.

* The board is huge with a lot of dead space (since the map has not been compressed or contorted to match the game's level of abstraction). The harbour track is not strictly needed but it's also not offensive; perhaps it could have been placed on the separate harbour board.

My fave worker placement game used to be AoE, but it's since been eclipsed by this.  Lavish over-production, 2 neat phases (planning & execution) which gel impressively, awkward decisions at every turn.  The first phase has sufficient variability to ensure each play is quite fresh.  And, for a Euro, the theme shines though pretty well.  And...best insert ever.

Gather resources, then use them to raid cities, attack forts, sink ships, or just deliver and sell them at foreign markets, all in a Euro way. Fun enough to play, but a little too cutthroat for me. Not that there's a ton of take-that, but you can definitely screw other players by getting to places first. Thought I was doing alright, but turns out I was last place after final scoring, which didn't feel great.

Ok exploration game. The action selection track is quite interesting. You can only go forward and have to go fast to secure the best stuff, but not too fast or you will not have enough stuff.

Quite simple and straight forward worker placement game that is much too long for what it has to offer. If the game was shorter by at least a third, it would be more enjoyable: Francis Drake doesn't really develop during it's playing time so the game starts to feel samey after a while. Also ridiculously over produced resulting in a much too hefty price tag.

Reminds me a little of Turfmaster in that both games are over-produced, and both repeat what would be a reasonably fun light-weight game thrice over.

Overproduced (and ridiculous expensive) game which doesn't evolve anywhere: you play exactly same game three times before it ends. The planning face is fun, but the action face is pretty dull - some key elements are totally missing. The gameboard is too big vompared to what it should be and there are plenty of unnecessary game components (for example those barrels). Francis Drake is a game which I'm ready to play again but it isn't unique or fascinating enough to be a game which I would suggest or need to own.

Absolutely fantastic production values went into the making of this game. The board is gorgeous, the components are superb with plastic ships and barrels and thick wood discs you get to put stickers on. The game is easy to learn and great fun to play as a captain not unlike Sir Francis Drake. You provision your ship and with the blessings of the Queen you sail off to attack Spanish galleons, forts and towns, while doing a little trading as well. Even the storage in the box is well designed and in some ways so thoughtful. All ships have been painted.

A really good pirate Euro-game that has high interaction (jockeying for worker placement). It reminds me a little of Egizia but I tend to like this scoring system a little more.  There are multiple paths towards victory - you can specialize (but penalized for not being diversified) or pursue diverse strategies.  It may possibly be best with five players and it's very good with four.  The more players then the higher and more tense the decisions are.

Beautiful production values but it just kills me that each of the three game rounds are basically the same outside of the tiles being shuffled into a different order. Wish there was some arc, narrative, or growth to the game.

Cool middle weight Euro that has an interesting series of build up and execute action structure.  Perhaps the game would have more tension for me if the three rounds ramped up the intensity somewhat in ways beyond simply the race for a limited supply of trade commodities.

RATING: 8
A wonderfully beautiful game. The components are some of the best I have ever seen in a game and the board looks like it deserves to be in a frame. This game is all about getting into the heads of your opponents. Knowing what they want and figuring out where they are going is a main portion of the game. This is a seriously under-rated game and could use more love. It can run a tad long with 5 or 6 players though.

RATING: 5
This is a gigantic game, overproduced to a fault (the gigantic board makes it hard for players to see the different parts of it well, the big wooden barrels are barely used, and there are player mats for no reason whatsoever, as they don't track anything.) The gameplay, however, is a pretty neat idea, if a bit baffling (I'm about to set sail across the globe, but apparently a one-way street presents a navigation hazard to me.) I actually like how a round of the game unfolds, and I like that there are multiple viable ways to go about one's business.

That said, the game falls flat for a couple of reasons. The main one, as one of our players pointed out, is that there's no arc to it. You do the same thing three times and nothing from a previous turn affects the next in the slightest. With the exception of trade goods, you literally wipe the slate clean each time and just play another round. This removes a sense of daring and adventure from a game that should be reveling in it; sailing into the New World for plunder and conquest feels no more different from the shopping trip at home in the first half of each round.

I'd like to see a game with that shopping trip added to a more interesting second part, one in which the outcomes actually inform further rounds. As it is, there's no real sense of excitement, just, "Okay, we did that."

Some of the highest production value I have seen in a game in a while.  It shows that it's not the only the miniatures that make a game look and feel "expensive" or luxurious.  Francis Drake has excellent quality components, wood, glass, and heavy cardboard, and good art that does not interfere with playability (the map and parts are all easy to read and understand).  Excellent game, with two phases, a good WP phase followed by an "area control" phase (not really, but it's one way to describe the limited resources and the race to get them first and outbid others) with misdirection, hidden bidding, and limits.  The two phases merge flawlessly.  Good play lenght, easy to teach, a definite winner.

There are 2 parts to this game. The first is a worker placement that has a push your luck element to it. You can do the safe play or be risky.

a beautiful game board and nice looking boats bring the theme right onto your table.
 
But the gameplay doesn't fulfill the high expectations that the big heavy box promised us. It's actually quite a simple game, where guessing and luck play an important role. 

The main mechanism that drives the game is stolen from [thing=58421][/thing], where you also have an action track where you can pick any action ahead, but cannot go back.
 
The game actually falls apart in 3 rounds that look exactly the same.

So eventually a light game that can be played rather quick. And then you wonder why one should pay 60 EUR for this. Or it must be to use the board as a painting on your wall, or use the boats to play with your children. 

The copy that I played had some small production errors (board & wooden pieces). 

Not a bad game, I enjoyed my first play, but not worth the money.

On a shallow level, I just love the nautical theme, the tiny boats, the coins, the glass beads, everything.  But I also LOVE the resources track that always changes and that you need to carefully consider how big a jump you want to take to grab that item you want at the expense on passing up so much.  Then there's the bluffing of the combat phase and the simple, deterministic combat.  Just makes me happy.  My #6 favorite game of all time.

RATING: 9
Excellent game!

Components: Probably the best I've ever seen in a Eurogame, and I've seen some great ones. 

Theme: It has one, and better yet, it's not pasted on. The actions you take throughout the game, and how the 2 phases are constructed, make the theme immersive. 

Gameplay: Fun, but the game is quite a brain-burner at times! It's a big board, there's lot of options, and because the game only has 3 rounds, any mistake you make can be detrimental. It might not seem like a tight game, but it is! Love it!

Interaction: It depends on the number, I would guess. I've only played with 4, and while we weren't constantly stepping on each other's toes, there was certainly some screwage and blocking taking part. Playing this with 5 would be really tight!

Rules: I would say the rules are quite lengthy considering how simple gameplay is. There are a couple rule exceptions here and there, but nothing crazy. I would probably weight this game at a 3.1 or 3.2 rather than a 2.9 (BGG's current weighting). 

In sum: A really great game. My wife and I played this our first time with 2 muggles and they seemed to really have it down after the first round. This is not only a gamer's game. If you have friends who like to play board games at all, and are reasonably intelligent, this game is a great option! I don't know how often I would want to break it out with 2 (though I'm sure I will), but would play it anytime with 4 or 5

Played a Kickstarter copy once (with 5) at Buckeye Game Fest 2013. Must have for me now.

The goods market feels a bit overpowered and static but I really can't complain about anything after only one play. Nice production quality although many of the wooden bits were stuck together as if they were packed while the pain had not fully cured. 

I wish there were some 2-player variants but love the game.

This game has so much chrome, yet it delivers so little on theme. Francis Drake is one half Egizia, where you are gathering lots of resources, and one half Vasco Da Gamma, where you are turning those resources into points in various ways. However, unlike Vasco it is via a blind placement system: with five players this is extremely prone to player chaos, and you need to plan on being flexible in your overall plans.

Overall I found the game to be very big on the component quality but very thin on game-design quality. There's nothing too new here going on, and the game lacks any kind of gameplay narrative at all: you literally have to throw out all your resources between each of the three rounds, so the game is a tactical exercise in being as efficient as possible within each round. Nothing changes from round to round--- so I kind of fail to see why the game couldn't have just been one round. This is a great example of an undercooked game design getting gold star treatment on components--- a waste of money, if you ask me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Very Polished Eurogame, wrapped up in a pirate theme

A very interesting game.  In each of 3 rounds, players will be first recruiting crew and stocking their ships, then secretly planning their itinerary for raiding around the Caribbean.  Each time the order of the recruiting phase will be different, with some tough choices to be made about what to go for and what to let an opponent grab. 

There are different strategies to accrue points, and while it is possible to implement an overall points strategy, each round starts afresh - so each preparation phase involves different considerations and trade offs.  

Then come the tricky bit - trying to figure out the order in which to visit different cities.  Get there too late and your opponents may have already grabbed the booty.  First stop on the journey is a strong play, so important to figure out how best to use it.   It's also important to make sure one has enough cannons and crew to face the  challenge level of the target.

This isn't a euro where you (just) build an engine and crank it.  There are careful choices to be made in gathering resources, and a great bluff element.  Combined with excellent components, this game is a winner.

Rating based on one three player game.

First off, don't play this with three.  It's not great.  I would play again, but only with four or five.

Otherwise, the game is fine. It looks great, and the component quality is excellent.  

I very much like the first phase of the game, and it looks like it scales pretty well.  I was less enamored of the voyage phase, but I suspect this is vastly improved with more players.

Curiously, for a game that looks highly thematic, it isn't.  At all.  Theme and gameplay are completely divorced  To me, this isn't good or bad, I was just somewhat surprised.

I have no desire to buy it, but I won't run away if people want to get it to the table.

Edit:  Now that I've played Egizia, the game from which FD "borrowed" its only interesting feature, I would pass on all future games of this.  Score lowered simply because FD pales so badly in comparison.

I wanted this game for a really long time. The first half of a round is based on picking out how you want to plan/prepare for your trip. The second half of the round is bluffing the other players in order to execute your plan as best as you can. After three rounds, the game is over. I love it.

Great swashbuckling game. Tense selection phase in Plymouth with hugh replay ability due to the changing order of cards in each game. Then clever deduction and out-manoeuvring skills required in the battling phase. Love the challenge of knocking off a spanish galleon fort and town each turn.

One of the best in the semi-worker placement genre I have ever played. Quality components and artwork.

Expected more from this game. Looks pretty good but gameplay is way too average for such an expensive game.

Basically your standard euro cubepusher in a fancy outfit. (Interaction is only indirect, just pointgrabbing without actual warfare et.)

Was on my 'check this game' on my 'potential buy' list. Degraded to 'was fun to play once' immediately after first play. Not worth the amount of money. You can get better games at half the price.

Recruit crew, supplies, guns, and galleons  on Plymouth Harbor and set sail on the Spanish Main and conquer! Love the bluffing component and the blind “bidding” foe where you want to go. Also love the idea in supply gathering phase you can go forwards but not backwards. It’s similar to Patchwork and esteemed Egizia. Not many other games like it with that mechanic.

Dreadful.  Pass a pawn along a track of sixteen tiles assembling a crew and ship, then place and resolve four discs to represent voyages.  Clear board and repeat two more timess, essentially playing the same game three times.  Penalize the best performances by making them go last.  Give those who head home early only two measly points, whIch actually is a penalty as it makes you go later in the turn order.  Gold worth one more than silver.  Huge pirce, massive overproduction.  If I had never played a Euro before, maybe I would say it as worth playing, but as I am not a new one to gaming, I do not know why this game can expect not to be in the discount bins very soon.

This is a beautiful game that plays out with some excitement. There is tension in every move in all phases. I'm reminded quite a bit of Egizia, both in the uni-directional "worker" placement and the bonus points for variety of actions in a round, but they play sufficiently different to be interested in both. Drake has a bigger wow factor and more player surprises. Both great games.

RATING: 7
Amazing production value.  Gameplay moves quickly, not a lot of rules to get stuck on and it "resets" every year so even if you botch a year you are on equal ground the next year.  While there are lots of turn options there are only 3 real strategies you can take so I don't feel I can really try something new when I play.

This is a decent game that I'd certainly play again, but I do have concern about replayability. The game is already internally repetitive, with every round nearly the same as the last, so a single session is kind of like playing the game three times in a row. It also seems to be just a little too long for its weight--90 minutes would have been more standard, 60 minutes quite excellent. I can see this going the way of Lords of Waterdeep: entertaining for maybe a dozen plays, and then done.

This was the game of the month at the monthly Gungahlin Library Open Games (GLOG) and it lived up to the hype. Great components, interesting theme and some marvellous gameplay all meet in this wonderful game. After one game I am keen to play again.

After playing it I sort-of regret not backing it on Kickstarter, I would have too but for the postage to Australia being way too much. Nevermind, I know plenty of other people who ponied up for this and I think I should be okay to find a game about the place. This is one I would definitely buy if the price were right.

UPDATE: a few plays later and I quite like it.  Plays very differently with different numbers.

- quality of the components makes it so expensive 
- pretty big central board and the player boards(ships)i think r useless.
- i didnt felt so much the theme 

but i felt very much the tension "will i manage to take the good i want?"or "will i win the fight or will i be left out?" and "will my canons be enough to win all the fights i want?"

This is one gorgeous looking game! The board is very well designed, especially the auction/worker placement track. The mechanic seemed ok and the huge board gives you the nice feel of an epic sea journey. Ridiculous production value & some redundant stuff make it a bit pricey and huge; the big resource board for instance is pretty gratuitous. Anyway, felt solid & fun, I especially enjoyed the "load-out" phase. 

Now, I DO have this feeling it will probably get repetitive quickly, since there's optimal routes to take during the load-out and thus also during the looting phase, and some actions are maybe a bit weaker than others... but I could be wrong.

This is my kind of game. Nautical, beautiful components, and blend of some of my favorite mechanics. Even though the game employs familiar mechanics, the game has a unique feel. There is a lot of tension trying to anticipate what you might need for missions, while trying to stop others from getting their items. There is also a fun bluffing element and strain to try and predict what others may do. The components are some of the best I have ever seen.

Francis Drake is a very fun game, no doubt about it. A good portion of the game involves trying to outsmart your opponent by guessing their choices and paths. But you never lose focus of your own strategy, which is also not that constrained and may vary between a few choices.

The production value is out of this world. I keep coming back to the components of this game to use them for other games with less than stellar pieces.

For me, there are three cons to this game:
1. The duration, which may go up to 3 hours;
2. It is, in the end, composed by only two phases, but, the way it is done, it lasts maybe more than it should, so there could be more to it;
3. Since you only have three voyages, it can be quite unforgiving about players' mistakes.

RATING: 6.5

The components are splendid, especially the boats and the barrels. The board is way oversized, it will be an issue on smaller tables. Overall, the game is clearly overproduced; it's a deluxe version, but it also features a deluxe price.

The first part, an evident heir to Glen More, is my favorite. The second part is mostly blind bidding; there's some strategy there, depending on what others need and how many of each thing they have, but even with the best plan, things can go horribly worng for you and you can lose the game in just one turn there.

The game mechanisms are not new, the fit well together, but the gameplay did not grab my attention. It is played in 3 rounds that are almost completely independent, there's no evolution of any kind, except for accumulating goods. I would have liked more continuity.

The theme is there, it tries to remain afloat, but it finally sinks against the abstract nature of the eurogame mechanisms. Abstract!

I also think replayability will be a flaw. On your first, you've already seen it all. There are no hidden strategies to try, everything is pretty evident. And what's more, even in the same game, you already repeat the same things thrice.

I personally think that games where the cutthroat element is intense should not last less than an hour. What's the point of planning carefully during 2 hours to be thrown off the game in the last moment? Better do it in one hour, and you can play again and try to exact vengeance.

Despite all the stuff going on and the large box with serious (euro) bits this is surprisingly light once you get going. Even more so as there is no real progression. The board gets re-set each round with just gems collected and player order spilling over. On the plus side it's fast, fun and has enough theme to keep you going.

Al momento lo considero il miglior prodotto del 2013 malgrado il prezzo ancora decisamente molto alto. Il gioco si articola su tre turni di gioco (anni di spedizione), ogni anno viene suddiviso in due fasi, la prima ambientata a Londra dove i giocatori dovranno equipaggiarsi con quanto più materiale riterranno opportuno, e la seconda fase invece prevede la spesizione verso i mari lontani. Il gioco mi da l'idea di essere longevo anche grazie alla disposizione variavile delle carte per la raccolta delle risorse da imbarcare, inoltre cerca di svantaggiare il leader facendolo muovere sempre per ultimo e questo, specie se giocato in 5, rende ogni spedizione particolarmente gravosa. Un gioco strategico e avvincente.

While I really enjoyed the designers 'Wars of the Roses', this one really didn't do it for me.  In only three rounds, it's hard to do everything, which is understandable.

I really want to love this game.  I still have hope for it but think it needs house rules.  I think the tavern is completely out of place.  Why would one space have a die roll when there are no other die rolls in the rest of the game?  If you are gonna use dice, don't just splash them in.  I got a 1 on my last turn, lost over 10 points on last turn because I was 1 crew short, and the winner rolled a 6, got 3 crew, and beat me by 8 points.  

The other annoying problem I see is no compensation for having a later turn order at the start.  You are playing behind everyone else the whole game.

The game is great other than these two things which really irritate me.

First off, points to the amazing artwork and quality of the components of this Victoria-era, worker placement, resource management game. Francis Drake is definitely my type of game and I had a great time playing it. Rounds are divided in two phases: gathering resources with placing workers and then spending those resources by trading goods and attacking pirates and ports. While the gameplay didn't exactly blow my mind, Francis Drake ended up being a fulfilling experience.

The only thing that carries over from turn to turn is your end-of-game scoring things, so each of the three rounds you start afresh. There's no engine building. Basically you're playing the same game three times, adding the scores from each round. This lack of organic growth marks it down in my book, making a decent game 3 times longer than it needs to me when it has no sense of a building climax (or doom). If you take a round by itself, the resource accumulation phase is neat, jumping ahead "Tutankhamen" or "Egizia" like to grab the worker placement space you want, because you can't go backwards in the queue to a space you've passed over. So it's a matter of determining what people might be stopping for and assessing what can you get that will allow you to do different things to other people in the second phase. And in the second phase you allocate where you want to spend those resources, by secretly placing your 4 disks numbered 1 thru 4. At any given spot, someone's 1 will beat the other numbers, with tie break going to whoever finished phase 1 first. And this is where your game can be won or lost, simply because you placed a 2 somewhere instead of your 1 and you miss out on a 5 point bonus. Or be one resource short on a spot with a blind resource requirement revelation and bang that's another 13 points gone. The trick is to have 3 perfect placement rounds, and whoever gets closest to that wins. And getting closest is a fair bit out of your control, depending on luck on the blind revelations, and luck on what people go where with what and whether you guess right where people will go and with what. Which is a fair slice of guessing, and which sat somewhat uncomfortably when analysed after play given there's a whole of bunch of playing time (the resource accumulation phase) which is just the player's racing for stuff without much luck at all. All of which is to account for why it's not higher than 7, but of course a 7 is a solid Euro that's enjoyable and hangs together well, and that's the case here if you don't mind the playing the same game 3 times thing.

Francis Drake is a worker placement game that re-uses the "river" system from Egizia--once you claim a spot in the line of actions, you can only take actions that are further on down the line.  This is how you supply your ships, after that, you place your ships face-down so that your opponents won't know in which order you're doing things, and then everyone flips face-up and resolves things in that order, scoring points.  The game is played in three rounds that are almost completely independent--except for accumulating goods, how you do in one round doesn't at all affect how you do in another, and the game doesn't ramp up in any way.  I'd certainly prefer a little more continuity, but overall the assortment of mechanics works well together.

Second game I play from Kayal Games and it's sort of the same feeling as I had on Triassic Terror: There is absolutely nothing wrong with this game, everything works excellent together. But there is also nothing new about this game. So if you like the genre (area majority in Triassic Terror and gathering resources in Francis Drake), you will certainly enjoy playing these games. 

A big plus in both games is that they are tense while playing and thematically everything feels right, not just a theme-paste-on.

RATING: 5
Beautifully produced (overly so?) slog fest of mechanics done better in other games. 3 nearly identical rounds (with interstitial reset) each broken into two phases.

Phase 1 = Egizia style worker placement without the sense of accomplishment (or frankly, tension) as it is only a resource collection phase (plus a couple of selections affecting the the actions of the 2nd phase). 

Phase 2 = hidden placement of turn order discs (similar to Ys) which determines the order in which each player will use their resources to collect sets/VPs (only the first 2 people at each port/ship will gain something). (In Ys, however, there is an element of deduction as well as the ability to place multiple bids in an area for a majority; in Francis Drake you can only place one of your order discs in each area and there is no information, and virtually no way, to deduce what others have placed. You either place one of the two earliest discs or you have wasted your action.)

Somehow these 2 parts come together in a beautiful to behold game that somehow seems a bit like Age of Empires III (in both look and feel). Francis Drake is a bit more rough edged and missed the mark in a couple areas when it comes to functionality of presentation. Why is turn order positioned left to right at the beginning of the first phase and then right to left at the end of first phase and for the remainder of the round? -- Confusing!

Would much rather play each of the referenced games than this unsuccessful rehash of their mechanics.

After playing a 5-player game, this is the Kim Kardashian of board games 2013. May be nice to look at, shiny and put together on the surface, but upon closer inspection there is nothing new, interesting or remarkable.

This game uses a system we've seen before in games like Glen More where there is a row of tiles and you can jump ahead as far as you like but going too fast or too far and you miss out on the resources you need to get the job done, too slow and you'll lose a lot of points to ties, since turn order is really important in this game. It creates a sense of urgency to getting your stuff first that I really enjoy.

Then the second part of the game takes place on the map as you try to beat out the other players to being first in all the spots you can assign to.

One issue is that this is not a game where you build an engine. The game takes place over three rounds, and before each round you reset, so one of the two things you can do early to help yourself in later rounds is grab up turn order. (The other is the collection of resource sets, which does build across multiple turns, but it's a small point contribution overall). 

For re-playability the game allows you to shuffle the location of the different action tiles. This changes things up nicely between each of the 3 rounds, but ultimately isn't a big help in terms of changing things up game-to-game.

Francis Drake has the appearance of a heavy game, but plays fast and smooth, even with a full table. I really enjoyed the separation of the preparation phase and setting sail, as I think it helped keep things in perspective and allowed players enough freedom to dodge or disrupt other players goals without slowing down the game. It's also nice that you can shuffle up the available action tiles and it doesn't change the balance of the game. In fact, it only makes it more interesting.

It's a bluffing/sort of bidding game with a lot of push your luck. It's completely turn disconnected. Each turn is another game. Way too long and too much managment tasks going on for what it is. Great components that do not serve any useful purpose besides being beautiful and nice to look at. The ships are great, but they just stay there the whole, you don't actually take actions with them. If you have more points you are last to go, which is a great disadvantage but you could actually be the one with less points as wares and precious metals, that are worth a lot of points, are only counted at the end.

(+) Nice components
(+) Very tense worker placement phase
(+) Combination of secret bids with worker placement is original

(-) The game takes 3 rounds to play and resets after every round. Basically you play the same game 3 times. It lacks a feeling of 'progress'.
(-) I do not like the theme. Attacking cities, fortresses, ships and collecting trade goods no longer appeals to me. It's hardly original
(-) I'm not convinced the secret bids in the second phase of every round increases strategic possibilities. To me, it just adds a mainly random layer of uncertainty decreasing the strategic depth of the game

Top of my collection. Easily in my Top 3(for 4-6 players) for a long time to come I'm sure. Great and original worker placement game. Very thematic. Three voyages split into two distinct phases, each very interesting and fun. Relatively brisk gameplay for this type of game (with tons of meaningful decisions). Tension and bluff and social deduction included !

Moreover...one of the most beautifuly produced game, joy to look at, oversized heavy map with great components.

05-02-2014. Rated after first play with 4. I like the game a lot. First, the game is gorgeous. Second, hidden action selection is an interesting way to keep your opponent guessing. The coins reward for going first, and at most locations you cannot get more than 2 actions performed, bummer to be third since you'll be late to the party. 

I love gearing up for the voyages, the one way street is a great way to bring tension to otherwise a boring part of the game. You constantly feel the tensiom between getting the action, versus giving up other great actions.

Less nice I think it the way the game resets between rounds. Takes a little strategy away.

All in all, I think its a nice game. Not too meaty, but also rather quick.

Finally got this game to the table and Wow! It's pretty amazing!

The components are top notch as the board is beautiful to look at and the little treasure chests that hold your gold, silver and gems are really cool. The plastic ships are cool, especially when you upgrade from a frigate to a majestic galleon so you can wage ship to ship warfare!

Deciding which supplies to take with each voyage to the Spanish Main is really challenging. After only two plays, I don't have a feel for what kind of strategy will work the best. I guess only repeated plays will reveal that answer.

RATING: 6
A smooth flowing game with good logical rules that's light and easy to teach. There's three turns with each broken into two halves and games should come in at under two hours.

Firstly you have an Egizia style worker placement system that's a worker placement style I'm rather fond of. Players can choose the pace they want to place up to ten worker disks, with the first into certain buildings grabbing the richer spoils. You're looking to acquire four different resources with a few special action offices thrown into the mix.

After everyone has acquired their resources, players will make blind bids using at least four numbered disks on various geographical locations on the board. There's four different categories to aim for: Trade goods, Spanish galleons, forts and towns. Each require their own certain mix of resources to acquire and each rewards you with victory points in one way or another. Additionally there's a race here to have the lowest numbered disk in a location because the first in gets the bonus gems worth a few (yet significant) victory points each (except for trade goods spaces).

Tally it all up after three rounds and the most victory points wins. Each round plays a little differently because the resource buildings and offices are randomly laid out in a different order each round. Goals will be slightly modified each round depending upon what resources each player manages to pick up and where the competition is placing their numbered disks. Making sets of trade goods will steer players in the final round and bonus points from an even distribution of location categories is not to be ignored.

Overall I like the game because it plays so smoothly, is easy to understand and is so easy to pick up with new players on a first play. Conversely that might also be what makes it a three or four plays a year type game - not that this is a bad thing. It would be a game that would be easy to overplay and get bored of, but at the same time it's so easy to pick up after a long break and dive right in (even with infrequent gamers), that I like it for that reason too. A decent game that I'd consider buying a copy of if it came in a box half the size.

It's Huge.  It's heavy.  It's pretty expensive.  But the hit to shelf space, sore back, and drained bank account are all well worth it.  

The game is gorgeously overproduced, fantastically fun, and my number two game of all time.  I cannot recommend this game enough.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
An average euro with beautiful components. My major complaint is that there seems very little that connects the three game turns. The set collection aspect of the trade goods is really the only thing that adds continuity between turns. Playing Francis Drake feels more like playing 3 separate mini game sessions as a best-out-of-three, rather than a full game that builds up toward an overarching goal. Adding mission cards, tech or skill cards that carries over between turns, or end game bonuses, may all help to solve this problem (future expansion perhaps?). 

As it is, I would rather play the similar, but much better game, Egizia.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game is big and beautiful, but very approachable. The actions make sense, and the board and graphic design in general helps guide everyone along.

The two phases (shopping and sailing) are both really strategic and deep and interactive. Do I want to make some long-term choices to go after some commodities, or do I want to fight and get points now? And which action spaces are available that will help me do what I need? Should I jump ahead in the market to get some quality stuff, or should I go slowly and get a lot of quantity?

Then, trying to decide where to sail and in which order is a great mind game. Choose wisely or you risk some wasted sailing actions.

Francis Drake is a memorable "event" game that has a large scale and tells a great story. I look forward to many plays of this one.

[1 play] Fun! Closest comparison is another game I really enjoy, Age of Empires III. Francis Drake greatly expands the richness of the worker placement battle for the docks at the sacrifice of the area control and warfare aspects in AoE III. The trade off is worth it. Both games have a trade good set collection element, special abilities to incorporate and contemplate into your strategy, hidden strengths to consider when conquering, and a crisp progression of game play.

EXTREMELY over-produced: the HUGE board is nice, but the game play does not really justify the ridiculous box, custom insert with cover, wooden and glass bit, cardboard tokens, or miniatures.  I mean, c'mon, the minis are really just roudn and turn order makers and don't even really get moved around and half of them are just to signify that the player upgraded the ship!  Nearly all of the wooden and glass bits could have just been cardboard tokens since they are just taken to signify a gained resource and are given back (almost immediately in the case of the barrels).  I don't get it.  The box is huge and must weigh 8-10 pounds!

As far as game play goes, it's interesting, but nothing really revolutionary.  Players accumulate resources (basically a drafting mechanism) and then goes out to either trade, conquer a town or fortress, or attack a galleon.  The attack order is based the players putting down secret priority tokens.  There is some push-your-luck involved since not all defense is known, but there are ways to mitigate it, but not fully.  There are 3 rounds of getting resources and fighting.

I have only played the basic game in which the items on the dock do not change order.  I really think that using the card to randomize the resources on the dock would really improve the game.  However, starting 4th of 5th in a game with that many players seems to be really difficult and the extra cannon to start doesn't seem to really be enough to offset the disadvantage.  Also, the point system seems to be too much of the rich getting richer.  Needless to say, I didn't have a great experience, but the game was interesting enough that I'd like to play it again.

I've only played it once but I liked it. It's a very thematic Euro and those are rare beasts. Each game consists of 3 expedition rounds which are in turn broken down into two phases: a worker placement phase where you are competing to grab ships, guns, crew, and the favor of important people (like Queen Elizabeth) and the go loot stuff phase where you are competing for who will score the best loot in Spanish America. You need the stuff in the first phase to accomplish the stuff in the 2nd, which gives the game an interesting two step dance feeling. I've given it a 7.5 because I'm a bit on the fence about how deep the mechanisms go but it definitely provides some novel twists on worker placement and despite being very Euro the theme really does shine through very strongly. I'm probably not going to buy it because the theme wouldn't appeal to the wife, but I'm glad a buddy has a copy.

While Francis Drake does not really have much to do with the game, I still had lots of fun with its mechanics.

It is not my favorite piracy game, but it is a good one.

The game is beautiful, but that's about it. It's been compared to Ys and Egizia, but you're much better off playing those two games than this. I think the key problem is that nothing builds from round to round, so you're just playing the same game over and over again. I'd say that it would be good for a play or two, but after that, there's nothing all that great going on here. Also, it just seems that you have one critical point where you either jump ahead or slow play and go cleanup and then the rest of the game plays itself. I think that if the game built up round after round that it would be much better.

2 plays, 1 year apart (prototype form, then preproduction copy).

This is a nice worker-placement game blended with a little set-collection and ... some other stuff. You're playing Captains out on missions for the crown, raiding Spanish towns and forts, and fighting Spanish galleons. You start with a frigate, collect resources necessary for your missions, then head out to the Carribean to do your work. There are 3 game turns, each of which begins with a worker placement phase similar to Caylus and Egizia. You have an unlimited number of workers (I think?) but are unlikely to use them all since you will need to jump ahead on the path sometimes to grab something before another player does! There are several duplicate stops, or stops where you get a similar but weaker benefit (e.g., collect 1 gun instead of 2). So you're not totally locked out of stuff; you just have to manage your resources to do the best you can. Other stops upgrade your frigate to a galleon (required if you want to fight the Spanish galleons), give you trade goods (needed to collect each of the 4 types of goods; full sets are worth significant VP), give you some knowledge or control over the Spanish defenses, allow you to conduct an extra (fifth) mission, etc.

The worker placement phase also determines turn order. When it's done, everyone indicates which part of the map they can reach (based on amount of supplies collected in phase 1). Next, the Admiral and Governor (chosen by worker placement) allocate the Spaniard's naval and land defenses (all of which have a base defense printed on the board, plus 0-2 depending on which tokens these players place, face down). Then, in turn order, players place their 4 (or 5-6) numbered discs face down in the locations they'd like to conduct missions. The Informer gets to look at some face down stuff (mission discs or Spanish defenses) and swap 2 of their own discs. Then all player discs are revealed and arranged in numerical order, with turn order breaking ties.

Players move their ship tokens to their 1-disc and resolve them. Then the 2-4 missions. Each location, though, has limited spaces; it's possible that a mission will fail because others got their first! Missions could be simple trade missions, where you trade your trade good for a counter; land attacks, where you spend crew and cannon to attack a town or fort (earning varying VP; the first player winning these also collects the silver or gold token there, worth 3 or 4 VP); or ship attacks, where you spend cannons to fight one of 3 galleons (the first winner at each location earns a jewel worth 5VP).

After all missions have been resolved, score additional VP for having attacked 2 or 3 types of targets (towns, forts, galleons). The Admiral and Governor may also earn a few VP for gold and silver that remains on the board. Then return all your resources to supply, randomize the worker-spot order, and set a new turn order (reverse VP) and play the next era. After the 3rd era, score VP for all the silver, gold, and jewels you have collected: most VP wins!

This is a reasonably simple and pretty straight-forward worker placement game.  I'm usually very discerning about worker placement games, probably my favorite flavor of board game, and not usually a fan of simple and straight-forward games in general...but for some reason I can't explain I love this game!

Perhaps it is the components.  I've played games that because of amazing game play I was able to forgive poor component quality (Mage Knight Board Game and Ora et Labora for example) but this may be the first time I've fallen completely in love with a seemingly average game because of the components.

Are they really that good?  No, they're better!  These are the best components I've ever seen for a game, and by a huge margin too.  Everything from the rubber ships that represent player's ships to the little rubber crates that represent supplies to the colored glass beads that represent jewels to the little cardboard treasure chests you place these jewels into just looks amazing.  When I bought this game I was shocked by how large the box was and that's because inside is a divider that fits everything neatly with a little plastic lid to keep things from shuffling around as well.  These words don't do it justice, just look through the images here on the Geek.

And to be completely fair there is a very good game here too.  Yes it is simple and straight-forward.  There are two phases in each round.  In the first phase you collect resources.  In the second phase you use those resources to pick up goods and attack forts and enemy vessels for points and loot (worth more points at game end).  But there are still some neat and fun concepts here.

For one, this game uses a mechanic where all the action spaces used in phase one are positioned along a street and once you take an action you can never go back and take earlier actions.  So if you want a valuable space you can jump ahead to it to get to it before your opponents but you may be giving up on several other spaces in the process.  For two, some of these spaces give players certain role bonuses that make for interesting game play in the second phase.  The governor and mayor roles let you place tiles that bolster or not military locations so only you know where the weaker points are.  There is an informer role also though that lets just that player look at these tiles and rearrange action disks based on that information.

It may be simple but it is also incredibly elegantly designed with many interesting decisions, is dripping charm, and is mostly well-balanced.  I do say mostly because the Golden Hind space (of which there is only one in a 3-player game) seems a bit overpowered.  It not only gives a player an extra action during phase 2 but that action also gets to happen first despite that player's turn order.

That really is the only complaint I have about it, an excellent game.

Francis drake is, first of all, a very, very beautiful game with excellent components and a truly engaging experience.

The game is not very heavy with intricate decisions but the up port phase can be nasty (mainly if played with 5 players) and the timing for players to stop by or advance can mean a  lot. We felt that more barrels' options were needed, kind of like what happens with the crew and cannons because at some point (again, with 5 players) there are not enough options to go for the barrels. I understand that the game makes more sense if not every and each player can reach all regions but it should have a bit more opportunities to do so as it can get really annoying not having enough places where to play. 

I think there are 14 barrels available for each journey and we needed a sum of 20, which unlike the other materials were always scarce.

The new world phase it's fun too and the options available to get VP's seem enough and diversified. The only down of this phase is its minor up-keeping that breaks the rhythm and because there were more than 20 discs on the board got really hard to organize everything in our minds. 

Overall it's a quiet interesting game that I would want in my collection.

Great theme. Over produced, but sumptuous. From one play with 3 think will prefer with 4 or 5. The fun is trying to second guess others plans - a Hawes hallmark from War of the Roses. I like the 'Egzia' provisioning, and sailing selection, though it feels a bit flabby with 3. Would also have liked it if the three rounds had some sort of progression rather than being the same. As with any game  the right group will make entertaining - with a bunch of spods it will be torture.

Beautiful game. Relatively quick. When I was taught the game, I was told that it is "not an engine building game". That was helpful for me to keep in mind. The same game basically three times. It plays pretty quickly and it makes sense. You gather what you think you will need for the mission, then you try to use it in the best way possible.

RATING: 6
Each of the three turns is split into two phases of actual play and a few more of bookkeeping: first, collecting resources (crewmen, guns, trading goods, etc.) by placing workers along a track a la Egizia (always forward, never back); and second, choosing where and what order to spend them.

The first part is bog-standard and not of interest, but the second deserves more detail: each player has action discs numbered 1-4 which are placed face down at various locations. Each of these locations consumes some kind of resources (guns, crew, trade goods) and returns victory points or things that give victory points. First in usually gets a bonus, and only the first two in can use the location. The trick is that discs are resolved in numeric order, so if you put your '4' somewhere that has two other players' '1' discs, tough luck. 

If squabbling for resources in port feels vaguely thematic (though mechanically old hat), using those resources does not. It doesn't help that crewmen and guns are essentially just currencies, used at different locations but otherwise featureless. There is no major strategic variation in their use; in fact, because almost nothing carries over between the turns there is little long-term strategy at all -- it is more like a short game played three times in a row than a longer one.

While the bluffing and second-guessing in the disc placement does add some torturous psychology to the proceedings, I feel as I often do with this sort of hybrid design: it's either a lot of tedious worker placement guff interfering with an interesting bluffing game -- again, a shorter game played three times -- or a lot of uncertainty interfering with a fine efficiency game. 

The presentation is attractive but the game itself is less than meets the eye.

Gosh, what was the name of that game from several years ago where players took turns placing face-down chips to bid on the actions they wanted to take?  That one wore thin after a half dozen plays, and it has pre-worn this one thin for me before the end of one single play.

I really enjoyed this.  Egizia style worker placement + Aladdin's Dragons blind bids for ship actions.  Fun, engaging, and well-paced.  It was brought up that the game might get wear thin a little quicker, because each round is essentially the same thing over and over again.  I'll have to play more to find out.

Oh, and the game might be overpriced, but it is an absolutely gorgeous game.

OK theme play.  Fairly easy to learn, but will take a few plays to get the rules down pat and develop strategies.  Player interaction is minimal.  I'm not sure this one has high replayability, need more plays.  Components are excellent - beautiful mounted board, wood and plastic playing pieces, thick tiles and player boards.  Artwork is above average.  Game length feels right at about 1.75 hours.

Accomplished and lavish worker placement game with an exploration theme. Players take the role of an explorer who has to conduct three different expeditions to the Spanish Main. This is done to conquer settlements, defeat enemy fleets, and obtain trade goods, and by combining these goals leads to the player earning victory points. Prior to the exploration phase there are several worker placement steps, where players have to gather resources enabling them to carry out their aims once they set out to sea. These include amassing crew and cannons, upgrading their ship, and acquiring supplies etc. Player order plays an important part of the game and you can be unlucky if other players are competing against you for certain targets. The production values are of the highest order and the connection between the two phases works really well making 'Francis Drake' a welcome addition to the worker placement genre of games.

Perfectly enjoyable game with stunning presentation but didn't do anything in the gameplay department to really grab my attention.  I like that as you move through the market you can sort of start to deduce each player's intentions and how that will affect you on the map. But there was a real disconnect with the theme for me. I think it was the bonuses for doing multiple action types, the gem valuations etc that made me feel like it was more of a spreadsheet than a game. (see games by Uwe R. and Feld) They just pull me out of the experience and quite frankly the market is flooded with them.
Happy to play it anytime but also pretty forgettable.

This game has been getting quite the buzz, so I was eager to try it. It's kind of overproduced with plastic bits for things that would usually get wooden bits, and I as a eurogamer prefer wood, but that's nitpicking.
This game has 3 rounds each of which has 2 phases: planning - doing the [thing=58421][/thing]-style resource collecting and stuff - and than resolution where you gain points for the resources you got. I like the first part, I think the second part is OK.
Many people have complained about the reset between the rounds, but that didn't really bother me. What did bother me is that when you are one resource short or just 1 spot too low in player order, there are no consolation prizes. It's all or nothing. And if you happen to really need something for your plans which results in you being low in player order, you could miss out on a lot of things, but if you didn't go for the resources, you wouldn't have got the points either. Which gives quite an important all or nothing element that I don't enjoy.
But all in all I feel this is a very solid design.

Initial score: 6.8

Hmm. Why are people so excited by this? There's no arc; everything is the same in each of the three ages, just shuffled about for some (fairly good) variety. It's the same ships we're attacking, the same forts and villages we're raiding. There's no ramp up of tension or story. It's just play, repeat, repeat, end.

Each of the actions themselves are fairly decent and the action selection is a nice touch that I've not seen before as far as I can recall, but since it seems that you pretty much have to try and do everything each turn or lose too many points that I'm really not sure there is much difference in play one or play 120... And with each play being three rounds of the same thing, that's a lot of sameness.

I got this via Kickstarter.  There are a lot of pieces, so setting up the board takes a while.  The game is divided into three turns, and each turn has a "provisioning phase" and a "sailing phase".  What makes this game so great is that the two phases have different mechanics that blend well together.

Preliminary rating of 7 here in the early going. Can't help but compare this with Egezia, which is one of my favorites. The difference being, I think Francis Drake is much less forgiving. In Egizia, when something important is taken by other players, there are alternative strategies and workarounds. In Francis Drake, if you end up without something, you might just be stuck. Maybe the workarounds will become more apparent in subsequent plays, but I think this will remain a pretty brutal game even if so. Still, it's interesting and I am looking forward to more cutthroat goodness.

Gift from Secret Santa. Thank you!!!
Played first game with 5 players, and the play time was about 1:50.  The box says 2 hours.  Meeting the box play time is always a plus!  I felt really engaged the whole time we played...no time to really get distracted and lose focus on the game which probably helps keep the play time down.

The game is split into two phases. One is an Egizia style worker placement where you can jump ahead and the other phase is more of a read your opponent blind bidding sort of mechanic.  Again I found it very engaging and look forward to trying it with our normal 4 player group, and 2 player with my wife.

My only real negative is setup/tear down time.  The insert is great though and so it might just require me avoiding the use of bags within the insert slots.

Nice mechanic for shopping for provisions on the street in town. The street strategy will change as the tiles get shuffled in between trips. Many things to look at. The production of the game is very nice, & the box organizer is impressive, but I still use plastic boxes for the pieces to lay in most of the slots or you will be scooping forever to get the pieces out.

RATING: 10
This a great gamer's game, with a ton of interesting and challenging decisions on every move. The variable order of the Plymouth street locations is truely clever and makes its replay value extremly high. Racing through Plymouth acquiring the goods for your voyage is a lot of fun, although nerve racking at the same time.

The raw goods: crew, guns, supplies and trade goods are augmented by the well themed characters (admiral governor, informer) and special locations (shipyard, Golden Hind and pinnace). All of these interplay with each other to enhance the strategic options available and they really complete the theme.

The sailing phase provides a different challenge again and encourages individual flare and risk taking. I do feel like Drake heading off into an uncharted Caribbean, not certain what fate awaits me.  

Beautiful presentation from Kayal Games, from artwork through to components. Now in my top 5 of all time.

Very good take on worker placement. The two distinct phases, one where you do standard worker placement and one where you secretly place discs to gain rewards, are both fun and have their own challenges.

However, I don't like that you have to do it all three times and everything (well, all but one thing) resets in between. After you do the worker placement phase and then the exploring phase, you just do it all again two more times. There's no real sense of progression, so you feel like you're playing the game three times in a row and then combining your scores from all three games. There's no sense of engine-building because you lose everything between rounds, and there's no ramp-up because everything is the same the second and third times, except the positions have changed.

I like the overall gameplay so much, but the lack of any sort of escalation or engine-building really makes the game feel stale near the end.

Decent game but quite procedural, a lot of the street choices feel quite forced by turn order (in that there is usually an obvious best choice unless you're going first), at least with a lower number of players.

First Impression:

An overproduced new generation eurogame.

What I liked: The components and the overall production of this game is luxurious and really adds to it. The two-part gameplay (planning-trip execution) works very well and creates both tough decisions and agony. The theme, though indifferent to me, carries through very well and the game really feels like planning naval expeditions. The flow is great, the game feels both tactical and strategic without a runaway leader problem, and there is no downtime. The "worker-placement" first part felt elegant, and the planning second part equally so. Finally, I overenjoyed the different resources that felt (and were) actually different in practice!

What I didn't like: As I said the theme is quite indifferent to me, but since it carries through it is really a minor complaint.

Note: Some players reffer to the "blind bidding" part of the game. I'm confused. The planning mechanism is not bidding in my book, as bidding, as I understand it, requires a resource to gather and bid. Here, you simply make hidden plans for your trip, knowing that your later stops will be progressively harder to pull-off, especially if you are greedy and push your luck to heavily contested areas as your 3rd/4th stop. If that's equal to f.e. blind bidding for paintings in Knizia's Modern Art, then I guess the term has been generalised too much to mean anything of importance.

Overall, an excellent game that impressed me. I'm looking forward to play it more.

OK so I'll admit this one is a bit over produced and that increases the overall price tag of the game. So many of the components could easily have been just a cube on a chart that was printed on the board as the bits themselves don't really do much. It's gorgeous though. As for the game itself it's quite a satisfying game to play. A combination of blind bidding and worker placement. A couple mechanics stolen from Egizia but as that game is seemingly never going to be reprinted I'm fine with that. Both aspects of the turn have some tough and crucial decisions to be made. YES this is the point salad game but you know what, I like those kinds of game.

Components are absolutely marvellous! The game is a combination of Egizia and Endeavour. Very nice Euroish game. I believe it has too much forward planning that can result in some analysis/paralysis. Also it is a little rich game. Only 1-2 times there was a close call in what you are planning to do. It is missing some intensity. the good news is that plays fast with 4 players (under 2 hours).

Update: I got an update from the designer that results in a more tight game which I think it is needed for players that have good experience with Euro games. Eager to try it!

This is a beautiful, highly overproduced games. The box is huge. The board is gorgeous. There are thick tiles, plastic mini ships that are superfluous, huge treasure chests that could have been flimsy player screens, glass beads, a die that is only used for one action spot that was barely used in our game. They spared no expense to make this game beautiful. I have to admit, it did add something for me.

But what about the game? I like it a lot. You go through a worker placement round where you walk down a street acquiring resources, mainly crew, guns, provisions, trade contracts and various bonuses. You can run ahead to grab something you need, but you can never turn around and get anything you missed. In the three rounds, the order of the street stalls are randomized. When you get to the end of the street you get a booby prize, you get one extra gun, crew or provision. Then you board ship and determine player order. Once you set sail you place one of your four numbered action markers (and possibly extra bonus action markers) in various spaces on the board (more provisions lets you access further locations). Then you resolve your actions in number order, which can mean you get screwed out of your action. Mostly what you do is conquest, attacking towns, forts, and galleons, but there is a trade option that is potent. Being the first to successfully attack something gets you a bonus, and attacking many types of things gets you a bonus too. Outside of trade goods nothing persists to your next round.

I love the mechanics of this game, the worker placement street and the numbered action disc assignment. There is a little bit of randomness as there are random modifiers on the things you attack, although there are special powers that let you know or change those, and even one that lets you decide to rethink your choice. Overall, this is a solid game with a good bit going on, and it's beautiful and fun too.

About [thing=140603][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=140603][/thing] is a work placement game in the same vein of [thing=58421][/thing], as in the first part of each of the three rounds, players allocate their workers in the roles available, but can't return to a role once it is past over, only going forward is possible.

The second phase of each round also is akin to the building phase of [thing=58421][/thing], as you use what you gathered during the round to attack treasure fleets, pillage cities and forts and trade goods.

Though the explanation of the game isn't all that easy, since there are several roles/buildings, and the placement of orders in the second phase alongside the way things work in this part, require some more explaining, once the game is going, there are few doubts.

[thing=140603][/thing] require some tough decisions, and the game status is mostly decided by the players: if someone jump ahead to get something, it might make someone, even everyone, to rush forward, grabbing whatever they can before going to sea.

[thing=140603][/thing] offers a fine amount of interaction, without high direct conflict - the dispute is more for spots and jewels, with some roles allowing for a little screwage with the positioning of troops and cannons, but these aren't really direct, as you can antecipated who will try to do what where, still can't be sure of it.

Therefore, [thing=140603][/thing] allows for a good level of hard decisions, interaction and is has some amazing components.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
The game runs from 3 rounds. The first phase of each round is where players use their workers to acquire several trype of things - crew, cannons, goods, supplies and can acquire the help/service of some roles, like Francis Drake, the Admiral, the Princess and others.

These buildings and roles are put in an order. Once a player puts a worker past a spot, she cannot return to it - only going forward is possible. Some places give better things for those that arrive on it first, but still can be used by other players (only giving less), while others - the roles - have a single place. 

Once this phase is completed, the next phase will start. The order for it is determined by the order in which players reached the last spot in the first phase. Players have markers numbered 1 to 4. Now they will put then, without revealing the number, in places around the board. The supplies taken in the first phase allow for a greater number of possibilities here, as the board is divided in 4 sections - to put a marker in the 4th section, a player needs to have 4 supplies. So, if a player have gathered only one supply (the minimum amount), she will only be able to put markers in the first section of the board.

In the board there are four things players can make:
- trade goods;
- attack ships;
- attack cities;
- attack forts.

To attack other ships, a player must have a galleon (un upgrade of a ship everyone starts each round). Attack cities only required crew to be spent. Attack cities require crew and cannons (normally). And attack ships only require cannons to be used.

The numbered markers are used to determine which players will act first in a given spot. The lowest numbered marker in a spot acts first. In case of a tie, the turn order will break the tie for the player placing first. This is particularly important when trading goods and to take treasure, as only the first to beat a town, to conquer a fort or to defeat a ship, in a given spot, will gain the treasure - but everyone in the place can gain the points for pillaging the fort or city or for defeating the ship, if they have enough crew and/or cannons to spend.

After all the spots with player makers are resolved and bonus points are awarded, the next round will begin, with the turn order going from the player with least points to the one with the most (as in [thing=58421][/thing]). After three rounds, the player with the most points will be the winner!

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
Quite a few. There are lots of things to get and places to go, and so much competition. Because, in these sort of games, where you can't return to a spot, is important not only to consider what you want, but also where the spot you want is and what you will be leaving behind. You might want to go to the Golden Hind, to get the extra marker, or jump on Francis Drake for its great boost in crew and cannons, but what will be the cost of that? If you leave supplies behind, how good will that extra action be to you, or that amount of crew and cannons? Even more if you won't even be able to have a galleon to fight against the merchant ships.

Or you might want to go easy, and focus on trading and some sweet city rasing and pillaging. That might still put you in a position to race for the trade goods and crew spots, which others might also want.

Therefore, players must work around limitations and what the others are doing, in order to do well. Prioritize is a must in [thing=140603][/thing].

And in the second phase, while not as hard as the first, since in the first you mostly decide what you will be able to do in the second, it still important to decide where to best put the numbered markers, as this can be key in winning the treasures.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Superb production value - almost borderline excessive;
- Solid mechanisms that make for hard decisions and good level of interaction, without kingmaking nor bashing;
- The only-go-forward mechanic, though not new, is great and should be used more in games;
- Language independant.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- Huuuge box;
- The flow of the first phase is rather smooth, but the change of pace between the phases of a round turn me off somewhat, awaiting for troops and cannons to be placed - not a big deal, but it bothered me during the play;
- Best played with 4 or 5 (which can be hard for some people to achieve);
- The game board is cluttered, to the point that, sometimes, a player would miss a city or a fort, while putting markers;
- Detached rounds. This is a BIG bummer. Nothing you do in a round carries on to the next. Know all that work you have to get cannons and crew? All gone. That nice galleon? Gone. Your friendship with Francis Drake? Gone. Players are simply playing the game same game three times over - there is no evolution, not in the board state nor in the players state. It is like if in [thing=58421][/thing] you would lose all the food cards, all your worker would set to starting levels, all the cards taken would be discarded and all the rocks in the monuments would be taken out. What? Sure, in between the rounds, years pass - but I'm pretty sure a galleon can last for more than 8 years, the same for cannons. The only thing that do carries from one round to the next are goods: and these are the ones that make the least sense to carry over! Such a bad decision to don't have any sort of proper developing and evolution of game state. A fort could become stronger after an attack, a city could also, or be gone completely, after being raised and ransacked too much. Sure, this isn't a really thematic game nor it tries to be, but if [thing=58421][/thing], a pure euro, can make evolution of game state, [thing=140603][/thing] could also.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Like reading a [url=http://imbasailingclub.weebly.com/uploads/3/6/9/3/3693092/sailing_manual.pdf]Sailing Manual[/url]: most of the parts of the thing it correlates are there, but none of the excitement. Now, the game does have tension: the positioning in the first phase and in the second can lead to some hoping really hard moments. Yet, when a game like [thing=140603][/thing], which comes in a enormous box, with glittering stones, treasure chests, barrels, two types of miniatures for ships, a map of Spanish Main, I'm kind of lead to believe that some high seas chases, hard-fought battles inland, some kickass ships upgrades and other stuffs like these would happen. But no. Just a [url=http://imbasailingclub.weebly.com/uploads/3/6/9/3/3693092/sailing_manual.pdf]Sailing Manual[/url] of the thing.

Now, [thing=58421][/thing] also doesn't have the sweat, heat, logistics challenges and related issues involving the building of the pyramid and other landmarks. Doesn't have a strong link to the theme isn't bad per se, nor it makes a bad game. However, the production of [thing=140603][/thing] is more misleading than most and deserves a mention.

[thing=140603][/thing] works well and is a proper solid and good game. Still worst than [thing=58421][/thing], though, mostly, but not only, due to the lack of development in the game. Why this is a good decision for this game is beyond me. This isn't unique to [thing=140603][/thing]: [thing=2842][/thing], [thing=129622][/thing], [thing=215][/thing], and other games where winning rounds is the goal. You keep playing over and over again until someone reaches the end line, triggering the end of the game. Is most common with cards games, where keeping track of changes in the game state, other than a simple change in score, can be cumbersome. For board games this isn't all that common, though. Designers understand that players like to develop things: a city, an army, a company, a point machine, a proper machine, or build up a character, a car, a ship, whatever. This is what pushes the game forward and make players want to keep going.

As it is, is possible to argue that a game of [thing=140603][/thing] could be a single round affair. Or two, or four. [thing=58421][/thing] ends in 5 rounds because of design decisions: the workers would be already strong, some or most of the buildings are near or full completed, the stone and food markets are mostly used to the highest point. A 6th round would only make for a poorer addition, without too much to add to what one already have and possible without much to build. If ended in the 4th round, several things would be cut short - it could still work, but would make for a different, more rushed experience. With [thing=140603][/thing] the only thing that makes 3 rounds is the goods - the 13 years old tobacco and coffee rotting in your ship's holds.

While I do recommend [thing=140603][/thing] as a good game, it makes me sad to see so much potential wasted inside that humongous box, even if the designer didn't wanted to make a washed down version, or a lite version, of [thing=25292][/thing], there were other ways to go that would lead to a more fulfilling experience.

RATING: 5.7
Impressive components and good mechanics make for a well-crafted game that's almost worth the hefty price tag, but it has a high screwage element that sits poorly with me. Limited actions and multiple goals mean that a significant portion of your turn's actions can be wasted if you fail to third- or fourth-guess your opponent's strategy and you lose out on a crucial location - and the game is only three turns long. This game will be enjoyed by those who enjoy intricate planning and are able to outguess their opponents, but for others it's an exercise in frustration. I honestly think it's an excellent game, but it's probably not right for me (that said, I think I need to give it a few more plays to be sure).

Do not understand all the excitement this game is getting. Worker placement game but nothing new and groundbreaking here. Each turn plays like a new game so there is turn disconnect. Unlike Carson City where plans and strategies are carried over turn to turn. Heavy Luck dependent based on turn order and what assets/supplies and voyages other players are chosing.  This game or Carson City and I would rather play Carson City. No brainer there. Drake is a beautiful game and has quality components though.

RATING: 8
This game is brilliant. It should hold a place in the euro-game hall of fame. 

As with most games you really need to sit down and play it to get a feel for it but there are a few things I think might convey my opinion in a relatable manner:

At first the game seems overwhelming, as most euro games start out, components everywhere! After your first voyage (the game takes place accross three of these) it all makes perfect sense. The flow of play is very obvious and clear at all times, without losing depth or complexity, which is nice. 
This game is all about getting the highest score accross three rounds. But because there are indeed three compartmentalised rounds makes it very easy to digest while playing.
The mechanisms lend themselves to favour those that stick to a strategy, at most Euro-games tend to do, but it is important to note that these strategies are almost constantly being usurped by your opponents whether directly or inadvertently. Meaning that, for those happy-campers that like to stick to one, formulaic approach to the game will find themselves hard-pressed to pull it off at the best of times. 
This is a game that forces you to be dynamic in your approach, every step of the way. 

I will play it again and it holds a place on my shelf.
If you don't want to buy it, you should at the very least play it. It was satisying and thrilling the whole way with plenty of hidden elements that allow you to burst forth into first place in the dying throes of the game, crushing your opponents with humble trade goods or a pile of jewels.

Components, mechanics, artwork, box/storage design are all 10/10 for me.

WARNING: this is a 2 hour push your luck game wrapped with heavy strategy elements.

It requires the advanced planning  and brain power of heavier games but has multiple push your luck elements that destroy these plans.

Or just play a heavy strategy game.

I love that basically a strategy game Euro, but on top of the beautiful production, it has a lot of very fun elements to it, push your luck and subterfuge.  It also moves very quickly, you have to pay attention to every move, which is great to have in a game that can accommodate so many.

After some more plays... I dunno, I still like everything about the game, but it does feel a bit repetitive and with lots of setup and board management for a pretty simple game.  My excitement to play has waned some.

Good game for the advanced casual players. Everyone has a good chance to win although skill(for me luck) will tip the odds in your favor.
The stock-up phase is very neat mechanism and mostly works like a charm, although it may also doom one player to simply get screwed if necessary cards line up and he is last in order thus practically "forced" to make bad selections which then in turn tend to mean the next selection also will be bad. In the sailing phase this kind of getting totally screwed is also present especially if you happen to completely miss most of your actions, which almost happened on a few occasions. You basically miss out 1/3 of your total point potential as there are only 3 rounds. So a little too swingy and luck dependant but when it works it works really well but for a 2+hr game I expect the bad luck factor to be at least a little more mitigated. Overall a lot of things are done very right but it still misses the mark of making it into my collection.

A good example of what a Euro can be, with a mix of opportunism and strategy that works, and a healthy dose of nastiness as players are constantly watching and calculating to see what the other players are doing.  The theme is not exactly everywhere, but it's not thin either.  It's supported as well as it can possibly be with incredible art and components, and there's a certain nastiness that feels very like being a just-this-side-of-the-law privateer.

Looks good but just another meh worker placement game with a slightly interesting forward-only worker placement mechanism (already seen in Egizia).

Too long and monotonous as you practically play the game three times just with randomly ordered action spaces, and zero progression between the plays/rounds apart from a few points-scoring only set collection goods - otherwise the game is wiped clean and setup anew. Completely pointless - except:

The starting order is horribly unbalanced. The (randomly chosen) fifth and fourth players are at a massive disadvantage with zero chance of being competitive unless the other players are useless. For example, starting fifth I could choose to move quickly ahead for a better turn order position but ending up with very few resources required to actually do anything; or stay behind and pick up as much stuff as possible hoping for that to overcome staying last in the second-half turn-order and tie-breaker - even that, using up ALL my workers left me with just two thirds of the resources of the first player. Surely the primary, if not only, reason to play the game three times is to try to make up for this horribly unbalanced starting order as the player in last place goes first in the next round.

But even that does not really work as one of the best point-scoring strategies seems to be to collect very limited goods which only scores at the end of the game, so the first players who have and take this option will also go first/early in the next round despite a big deferred lead. Instead of the paltry one cannon compensation to the fifth player, for example a choice of any four resources to the fifth player; any three resources to the fourth player; any two resources to the third player and any one resource to the second player would seem much more balanced.

If only the designer had bothered to balance the starting order properly like for example Manhattan Project does, this could have been a very good one-hour game like for example Endeavor instead of pointlessly dragging on for 2.5-3 hours.

Finally, blind bidding can be a lot of fun in shorter, lighter games, but surely not a huge, primary factor in a "serious", 2.5-3 hours game. The second half of the game is blind bidding with your four "1", "2", "3" and "4" numbered tokens to conquer different locations with ties decided by the turn order, so ties are very likely to occur and the turn order is hugely important. Being fourth and fifth in turn/tie-break order is really a joke with little chance of winning any locations except shitty ones nobody else wants.

Actually, thinking about it while writing this, forget about a "meh" game - it is simply a poor game as it is. If someone comes up with a "play it once" in an hour, balanced setup variant I would be happy to play it again, but otherwise I am very unlikely to ever play this again. POOR!

RATING: 7
We played three games today - Codenames, Francis Drake and Kingdomino again. I'll focus on the nicely themed and elegant mechanics of the Elizabethan era where players become English sea captain carrying their letter of marque to attack the the Spanish interests around the world. Players start in Plymouth harbor in 1572 and attempt to undertake three successful expeditions to the Spanish Main in search of fame and fortune! As captains, players will have to plan their missions and provision their ships accordingly based on the options open to them as each selection is taken.

In part, this game is both a race to be the first to secure the bigger prizes and return home safely with tidings of great joy as well as selecting options that maximise the opportunities this may present. Cards with a range of benefits from provisions through to improved ships through to personalities all have an influence on what can be attempted over each of the three turns. The first part of each turn is provisioning  and the second is the resolution of the various actions taken during an expedition. Players place up to four tokens of their colour each turn to indicate what they are wanting to do.

The decisions taken in the provisioning phase are the drivers for the level of success that might be possible and involve decisions around the number of crew, number of cannon and the size of ship. My first impression is very good - a strongly Elizabethan trading game - with abstracted combat included to represent attacks on cities, ports and shipping. This is resolved by allocating resources for each of these actions so if a player doesn't get access to the better cards, like being last in a given turn order, their potential operations can be restricted.

Players should aim to ensure they get three if not four barrel tokens - representing their provisions for the voyage - as the more they have the further they can travel. Players also need to be aware of the victory point benefits of achieving the three types of actions - assaulting, raiding and trading - as this scores more highly than if you only attempt one or two. You must upgrade your ship from a frigate to a galleon to attack Spanish galleons. There are only certain cards that allow this. Personality cards representing the admiral, the governor and the Queen can prove useful, but supply is key in my estimation. 

Another point to watch out for is the scarcity of certain provisions so each part of the known world - there are four of them - can only be reached by having the requisite number of cubes which are then 'spent' when the action is resolved. Each token placed in secret to represent areas being attacked or explored has a number, and the lower the number, the earlier that player resolves their action. Precedence is set in this way so being able to get further afield probably makes it less likely you'll be attacked in certain instances. 

Both the admiral and the governor may place four counters in coastal or sea areas representing the additional difficulty a potential attack may encounter so be mindful of this when selecting your resources and placing your action tokens. These two also benefit marginally from silver and gold not captured from the Spanish at the end of each of the three turns. The mixture of gems and precious metals is predetermined by the map board so targetting an area may be worth more in gems, precious metals and/or immediate victory points.

Gems and precious metals are counted towards victory points at the end and the game contains five model treasure chests to represent the secret horde each sea captain amasses. Players who obtain all four trade good types, or partial multiples of, also gain potentially large benefits in the final scoring so one type of good gives two VP. two gives six, three gives sixteen and all four gives twenty-six. I hope I have remembered the amounts correctly but the proportions are about right! Returning home first and second can yield two and one victory points respectively. 

Attacking the larger galleons and cities (ports) first is also another important part of the game as the first to achieve this in each instance is also the one to wrest the treasure from its previous owner. The draw of the cards at the start does affect your choices and missing the opportunity to pick up some or any of certain provisions can ruin your day. My selection choices were not good, and being drawn last (randomly) on the first turn is a little unforgiving and yet I still like the game. That is a good indication of a good game if the person reviewing it can still appreciate this even when the result at the first attempt was far from ideal.

Recommended to people who want a bit of context to their historical gaming....

RATING: 5
The strategies weren't well balanced meaning that there aren't actually different approaches you can take and still have a chance. This also means that the game requires players to block other players doing the good strategies, essentially doing the designer's work of balance for them.

With the three voyages, you essentially play the same short game three times with very little carrying over form voyage to voyage. Therefore, there is no sense of progression but rather one of repetition.

The preparation phase disk placement is interesting, but not well enough balanced for going last on the first turn (you can get better turn ordering for the later voyages, but if you are last the first time and therefore already going to be behind you have to get even further behind to actively move up in the order). Also, at least with higher player counts, you never use all of your preparation phase placement disks so the Francis Drake tile requiring two disks is not actually a drawback and therefore the space is much too good relative to other tiles.

I like the variable action track with linear action selection (can never go back after moving forward in a round). Actions are used to collect supplies, soldiers, guns, and trades. However, the sailing phase, in which you use what you collected, seems rather bland. You always have to perform the same 3 actions every round, otherwise you lose out on bonus points and fall behind. It truly seems like there is only one path to victory.

I've only played this game once, and it was quite some time ago. From what I recall, it was at the end of a games day with a bunch of friends. I remember enjoying the game quite a bit and how the two stages of each round plays out. I also recall though that the reception to the game was a bit of a mixed bag. I don't know if that was due to people being burnt out after playing games all day of what but I know that I enjoyed it enough to take a chance on getting it in a recent math trade. I'm looking forward to trying it out again soon and seeing what the expansion adds to the game as well.

Played twice. I think its an above-average game. Its quite good game for newer people to board games. Plymouth road is where it gets competitive. The raids on fortresses, galleons and towns as well as set collection is very good. Components are good.

Having played twice, once with the new 6-player expansion I have no real desire to play again. The game doesn't do much or bring much; but I do like the one-way street competition for resources.

Solid use of the Egizia mechanic, but I'd rather play Egizia.

Ludicrously over-produced (which I love), with a really solid game in there. The worker placement element has some really tough choices as you can't go backwards, and the sailing part is clever, with some bluffing and unknown bits.  All in all, really very good

I may well end up getting rid of Agricola in favour of this, seeing as I never enjoy playing Agricola with the cards anyway (too random for my taste) and the adventure mechanic is a really fun addition to the system.

This is Agricola turned on it's head. The vast number of choices are in your face from turn 1 and, importantly for me, you don't have to spend all game knowing where your next meal is coming from

RATING: 5
Best at 2 and maybe 3, and above that it really drags. I find that I really like the sandbox effect and relaxed feeling of the "feed your people" side-quest compared to Agricola, but you still sit and contest just a couple spaces on the (ever growing) board; the furnishing spot, which is unfortunate (mostly because I'm only passively interested in worker placement as an action draft mechanism). One of my favorite games to solo, I found it best (regardless of solo play or with other people) if you draft in roughly 2/3rds or 3/4ths of the furnishings instead of everything, otherwise the game becomes stale way too quickly. One other thing that I particularly don't like about the game is that it *requires* an organizer, otherwise it takes too long to setup/tear down to justify playing. Second, I found it encourages specialization in the cave so you spend most of your time jockeying for the furnish action.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.05
I may like this more than Agricola because at the end of the game, there is a feeling of abundance rather than disappointment.  In agricola, I can win the game and feel sad that I didn't create a good enough farm.  Time will tell though.

An Agricola variant, which means a high strategy, option-filled, "thematic", feeding-tension, worker placement game with great components and great scalability.

If you know Agricola you practically know how to play this game.  There are 12 instead of 14 rounds and each round you select an action (once chosen no one else can choose it), and periodically (with increasing frequency) you have a harvest where you get crop yields, feed your people and have animal husbandry.  This time you're a family of dwarves (odd yes) carving out a home in the mountains and growing a farm outside. 

There are a set number of actions to choose from that differ based on the number of players and a fixed set of actions that come into play each round like in Agricola. 

The main differences from Agricola are:
1) there are no cards. Instead the variability/special abilities/special point generators are in the form of rooms that can be built and these are ALL in play and OPEN to all players from the beginning similar to Agricola: all creatures big and small
2) there are now quests. Quests involve forging weapons using a new resource, ore, and selecting action spaces that allow you to choose free goods from a menu of items. The better your weapon the better the choices and the more you use your weapon the better it gets. 
3) scoring is more open. There are no minimums or maximums for scoring for example 20 vegetables is worth 20 points instead of being capped at 4 points and you don't get minus 1 point for not having any (caveat: you still lose points for having empty spaces on your board and for missing animal types)
4) there is another new resource, rubies, which are like a wild card. All rubies are worth 1 point each, but they can also be used to purchase almost anything at any time
5) family growth is not essential. You can go for growth but since family members are only worth 1 point instead of 3 points but still cost the same amount of food and there are more opportunities to grow and the game rounds are less, yes you can certainly win with only 2 players (after over 250 face to face games of Agricola I don't believe that is true for that game)
6) feeding is more flexible. Notice I said more flexible but contrary to what some people are saying it is NOT easy it is still a grind mainly because harvests occur nearly every round!
7) the game is 2 rounds shorter and scales from 1-7(!) players

I love Agricola it's my favourite game so naturally I really enjoy Caverna it gives me the same/similar flavour and feel but it's different enough that it feels fresh. If you enjoy one you will enjoy the other and most likely vice versa. Is it worth owning both?  Absolutely. I imagine that eventually there will be building expansions similar to how there are the card expansions for Agricola.

Impressions based on first play: thoroughly enjoyed this one. I'd hate to be the one teaching it, but I was taught it and really had almost no questions. I just ended up forgetting a thing or two, but this was really minor given the massive scope of the game. I think that speaks to the game being well-designed. A lot of the game is fairly self-explanatory too, which helps. I was initially overwhelmed by the array of buildings, but it was explained to me that the game is very much a sandbox where you can choose a ton of different valid strategies, so I just randomly chose a strategy (mega sheep pasture + high-level weaponry adventuring + almost exclusively acquiring gold cave tiles). I did lose, but the scores were very close (83, 87, 90). I was originally skeptical of the game, thinking it was a game where a new player would get absolutely crushed. However, while experience is certainly an advantage (due to better knowledge of the value of the buildings and due to being able to better recognize opportunities), this game pleasantly surprised me with just how accessible it is. I also like how the board state & accumulation of resources on spaces forces players to adapt (..and it's what lost me the game). Instantly beloved.

I should note that the friend who taught me had the broken token insert for this game, which is truly a must-have as it reduced set-up down to five minutes and made the ridiculous number of meeples very easy to manage.

Dreadful, the absolute worst experience I've ever had with a game.  Three and a half hours of watching people stare aimlessly at a table while arranging pumpkins and small animals.

RATING: 8
played 5+ games, 3,4,5 players. (5p = 3.5h)
first time play, we were all so excited, that we all had analysis paralysis and had to quit early.

LIKE: Lots of options, like the theme. scales player count well. multiple paths to victory. i generally enjoy "engine" games.
DISLIKE: The number of options is a bit overwhelming at first. Some analysis paralysis (AP). Slightly lower replayability, after optimal build paths are found (but there are a few to explore).
OVERALL: I like stealing other player's end-game bonus rooms, once you know the game well enough. Some people think it's not an interactive game, but the worker placement competition and when to grab certain scoring tiles keeps the game tense. Great game.

Comparison with Agrigola is obvious here. So similar the games are. In Caverna I liked the way you could upgrade your workers to make them more efficient. But that is really the only reason I would play Caverna over Agrigola.

The sheer amount of information the players are exposed to right from the beginning was so overwhelming here, that I almost lost interest in trying to figure the game out. But what amazed me the most, was that towards the end you seemed to have very little to do despite all the options given to you. Oh, I am sure that after a few more plays you would be familiar with the game allowing you to concentrate more on your strategy. 

But why bother? Essentially, Caverna offers very few new experiences to veterans of Agricola and Le Havre. Instead, the game is more cluttered and fiddly lacking the elegance of its predecessors. I also preferred the way, how in Agricola you are trying to find the best way to utilise the randomly drawn cards instead of a prescribed selection of buildings. In short, there are too many components to setup, too much information to digest on your first few plays, too many options to choose from, and still too little to do towards the end of the game.

I would play Caverna if asked, but I won't spend any more time on learning it.

Great game. For me it doesn't fire Agricola. I feel they're different enough that it's worth it to play both of them.  It's hard for me to pick a favorite between the two, but I guess I would lean slightly in favor of Agricola.

Play Caverna if you prefer: less randomness (Agricola has random cards dealt at the start of the game), to know all your options at the start of the game, easier final scoring, less punitive scoring, more focused strategies.

Play Agricola if you prefer: more variability between games, less up-front info to deal with (reading all the available tiles), more balanced strategies.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
My worry about this game is that by removing nearly all the randomness, you're left without much of a game and instead you just choose which strategy to follow and there just isn't enough replayability here. Wouldn't want to play this with more than 5 and I've yet to try it solo. It's a shame because he's made some nice improvements but has he left enough?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
(+) Multiple ways to win, always feel enjoyment from what you built, planning your strategy and engine is fun, plays up to 7, great components and art, limited amounts of "gotcha"

(-) Needs the variant setup in my opinion, expensive, can drag if you have a lot of players, prone to AP

(+/-) It's nice that it plays up to 7, but it makes the game more expensive and can drag if you have that many playing.

Decided to finally give "Agricola 2.0" a chance as I think my wife might prefer its somewhat less punishing approach.

I like how a lot of the Agricola mechanics have been streamlined, and I like the inclusion of the rubies and the adventuring mechanic, and it is possible to have a more variable early and mid game than is possible in [i]Agricola[/i] (read: a more variable early and mid game that can still lead to ultimate success). The variety of buildings is such that multiple different strategies could be pursued, but yet the strategies don't feel as varied as [I]Ora et Labora[/I], for example.  

I prefer this to [i]Agricola[/i] at higher player counts, if for know other reason than that it includes paths to victory that are not as highly-dependent on early round family growth.

We've only played one game so far, but everyone present agreed that we enjoyed it more than Agricola.  I'll start this off at a 7, and we'll see where it stands after a few more games!

I'm bumping this up to an 8 after getting several more games in and adding the Go7 Gaming storage tray.  The setup and teardown time is much faster than Agricola, and we can more easily just focus on playing.

Building animal farms and populating your cave with action-filled rooms makes Caverna feel like Agricola with the shackles removed. However, the static setup and wide open nature of the game make it less interesting overall.

Very fun, but I think I may have a hard time getting anyone to play this with me.  Having played the Agricola IPAD app, I can understand the sentiment that this is just not as strategic without the cards.  Hopefully there is an expansion that addresses this and makes players a bit less symmetrical.

A very enjoyable game, which fixes a lot of problems it's predecessor Agricola had, such as having an imitation action and simplifying the scoring system. It is accessible and not too hard to learn for even new gamers but still has a lot of dept and strategy to it. And win or lose, the satisfaction of looking at one's cave farm is always satisfying for most at the end of the game.

A great game!

I would rate this higher except I knew Agricola, and loved it, first.  Caverna is Agricola with some streamlining.  While Agricola has some flaws (streaky cards, mainly), I do think they can be easily addressed while maintaining the overall fluid nature of the game (draft them).  Caverna squashes that broad decision tree into a static pool of rooms that are always available to everyone (at least initially).  In my mind this inhibits the replay value, though it does make the game a bit more approachable and accessible.

My rating could improve with more plays.  It's just that when I play Caverna I always first ask myself "why aren't we playing Agricola?"
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
+ Mini Expansion.

Caverna is... amazing! For my first three years into the hobby, this has been my favorite game, as it has all the qualities I find enjoyable in a game. It has an excellent strategic depth with many many paths to victory and it's extremely challenging, since you have to manage so much in such a short time. For the 20+ plays this game overwhelms you with all the options and possibilities that offers, giving you a huge deal of re-playability. I have so much fun with this game, that I don't even realize the time running.

I find almost pointless to talk about the components of the game. I've never seen anything like this... just amazing! Yet what really makes this game shine for me is the fact that, when you're finished playing it, you can look at your board and see what you built. Your animals, your mines, your rooms: it's just too cool!

After 50+ I've to say that I'm sadly a little burned out of this game. Now that I've explored every strategy multiple times, I find myself wishing to see something new coming out for this game. I want a nice expansion with lots of new room tiles, that could bring back the feeling of an incredible amount of options that the game gave me in the first place. Until then I'm forced to lower my rating a little... and I can't say anymore that this is my favorite game.

Replaced Agricola for me purely because the stress factor is so much lower. Lots more spaces to go to but more importantly lots more GOOD spaces to go to. Would like to see a hybrid that replaces the room tiles with a personal hand of cards as that is the main aspect that Agricola did better. Also the theme is adorable.

RATING: 7
1st play: Despite not feeling well I really enjoyed this game. It reminds me of the best parts of Agricola Big & Small with more depth, more options and more brain burning. I like the variety of animals, even if I didn't use them well.

2nd play: I really enjoyed my second play of this. There isn't a ton of variability in the buildings that are available, and it makes me wonder just how much replayability the game has. It does take a while to set up and break down, so I have to be in the mood to play it, but otherwise this game is a nice compliment to Agricola. I don't see either game retiring for me anytime soon.

Great game, I like Agricola very much and I'm sure the ones that like Agricola will like this one, but I don't really know if they will like Caverna more than Agricola, it depends if they like Agricola because of the struggle for food or because of the card variation. But I prefered Caverna because of the better theme resolution and everyone able to do things better than in Agricola, the game has more flexibility in rules, but it is a little bit more complex than the predecessor.

Un grandísimo juego, con compoentes "top". Multitud de estrategias para puntuar y conseguir la victoria. No tan agónico y estresante como el Agrícola.
Aunque tiene el "setup" más estático que el "Agrícola", es mucho más pacífico y familiar que éste último, y con muchas más opciones y combinaciones. El hecho de poder jugarlo con jugones y no jugones es un punto a su favor. Para mí, aunque uno no excluye al otro, me quedo con el Caverna.

Definitely seems like there are more viable early game paths in this than in Agricola.  Rather than just an urgent need to grow your family in order to be competitive, you can viably start farming or start breeding animals much earlier on, as well as mining and adventuring.  I really like how adventuring rewards a small family size by forcing you to play your higher level character last.  If you want to be able to play it before other players adventurers, you need to have less people than them.  This gives a few reasons why you wouldnt just go all in on family growth.  Additionally, the harvests come fast and furious, so you really need to develop an early food engine.

Caverna is an interesting game, but it's definitely not awesome.  I enjoy it, but it's weirdly fiddly.  The choice of making some things cardboard counters when other things are wooden meeples is kind of odd.  It would have been nice if the dwarfs were something other than discs but I understand the choice of discs considering the use of weapons.

It's a very different feeling to Agricola without being that different in actual rules. Having tried it in the third game with avoiding adventuring altogether and building up a massive grain and vegetable empire, then proceeding to win, I think three people may come down to who chooses to do which.

Tried this before I tried Agricola.

I like building my cave and having something to look at at the end of a game. I like having different paths and a lot of opportunities - although, they overwhelm and provoke AP =/ I like that it has less penalties than Agricola, but don't like the same setup each time.

-> Need to do something with storage, although I don't like existing inserts - they take too much table space and we don't have it.

Very fun game, but since I usually play this at big gatherings and 6 players, rules explanation can take 30 - 60 mins alone and the game will go on for most of an afternoon.  I am okay with that, as the game feels like it has enough heft and enough arc to support that.

New players (and even people who have not played it recently) may be overwhelmed by the number of unique buildings.  There is a 'simple' version of the game that has many less buildings, but that version feel TOO simple.  I have not yet tried a setup where I take the simple game and then add a random X tiles from the 'advanced' ones.

I tend to find that the person sitting with the best view of the building tiles in a 6 player game will win, as others don't want to slow the game down by constantly walking around the table to see it well.  Sane humans would probably do best playing this a 4 or less players, heh.  It scales well for mechanics, but downtime becomes a serious issue.

Perhaps a higher rating them some have given it, but I like it as much as Agricola or more. So I had to rate it the same! So many pieces makes set up and tear down long. But the quality of the bits are great, and their quantity allows for up to 7 from the get go (and lots of options) which adds to this game. No there are no cards, but that is a selling feature for my wife, and I think there is plenty of replayability without them. The fact that the feeding takes place more often but is less stressful then it's counterpart also speaks to how masterful a remake this game is.

I played this game with the expectation that it would be everything my heart could desire in a cave farming game. I was not disappointed. Firstly, I was surprised at how very "euro" it all felt (though I shouldn't have been). It's nice to see that after repeated playthroughs, my group couldn't find a "best" strategy. Caverna's piece quality was pretty through the roof, just like its pricing and that made a difference during play. It didn't feel too much like point salad but there was enough of that to sometimes turn a game's ending bitter (the typical predictable last turn of a eurogame). The art however needs serious work. I would love to see a less "storybook" style version of this game in the future as a remaster. Overall very good, very fun, bad art, predictable ending, great component quality.

RATING: 8.4
Caverna is a VAST improvement over Agricola, and I'm not really sure why. I find it more tense than Agricola, although I see that the latter game SHOULD be more tense. Perhaps I find Caverna more tense because I never really feel drawn into the "world" of Agricola, and so what tension I should be feeling in that game is lost in a sense of, "Oh, what an interesting puzzle I'm doing." I'm drawn into the world of Caverna because it feels more realistic...and yet it's about dwarves? Huh?

I like that all the information is wide open to all players: no secrets among dwarves. It looks like multi-player solitaire, but it ain't. You MUST keep an eye on what the other dwarves are doing, and change your plans accordingly (at least in the first half of the game). As John Bandettini said: "It's like Agricola, but fun"!

Better than Agricola, but doesn't reinvent the wheel for me. 

I like Caverna and think it's interesting, I just don't think it's the bomb diggity like most people apparently do. It has a small buffet of options, but since the buildings are always the same and the actions don't differ dramatically--it's not something I want to play very often. The sandbox is fun, but samey. Chewing through the complexity is worthwhile. There just isn't a lot left to explore once you do.

Not as tense as agricola, and doesn't quite carry the sublime feeling the former game has of pulling everything together just at the right time, nor does it have a card draft which really elevates the 'gric into gamer nirvana. But it is highly entertaining, and much more accessible for non gamers. My non gamer gf loves it (and loathes agricola) and though the box can be as intimidating as hell, the rules are VERY well written. It doesn't take that long to play, the components are fantastic, and it gives a very satisfying sense of creation (more so than even agricola) as you watch your farm/cave take three dimensional shape in front of you. The price point is the only thing keeping me from recommending this wholeheartedly to everyone.

Played multiple times solo as part of the 2015 10x10. Not as good as agricola solo because it lacks the legacy element of keeping an occupation and building on your previous score, but still good fun and enough options to keep things interesting.

If you like any other Uwe game, you're probably gonna really like this too

Engaging Euro filled with gorgeous game pieces all the way to the top of the box. If you're not into farming or mining, you won't have much fun.

Great euro game. The design of the game is outstanding. I never played Agricola, but I believe that this is more up my alley.

The expeditions are fun, there's different strategies that offer really good results.

It does not play as well at the higher player counts, 6-7, but this was probably obvious to most people already.

The only issue is repetitive gameplay. Even with the different strategies applied each time after several close plays it feels a bit repetitive, but that is probably more of a flaw of the whole genre and not of this game in particular.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I was expecting a more advanced version of Agricola (one of my favourite Euros). Instead the range of choices make it a simpler more forgiving version. The 'adventuring' just seems to be a simple way of getting resources etc and a lame attempt at making a fantasy version of Agricola. Also the tiles allow for less replayability than all the minor improvement and occupation cards in Agricola. Not a bad game just not as challenging as Agricola.

Okay, so this game is gigantic, and has all sorts of crazy components.

It is very much a challenge to know if I prefer this to Agricola. I think they both do have a place.

Maybe I'm just too seasoned an Agricola player, but Caverna does feel quite a bit less tense than Agricola with the feeding and the need to grow your family, among other things.

And so, by its very nature, I guess Uwe had to compress many of the Agricola actions (getting fields and pastures going is easier, as is expanding your cave, and etc.) so that he could add something new and different (the adventuring). The game is fluid and takes out a bit of the mess of Agricola and it's nice that players can transition between the different tracks (adventuring and farming), but it doesn't feel much *more* than Agricola, just different. Enjoyable, though.

The big thing, of course, is the overload in getting the hundred community improvements upfront versus the cards. I understand Uwe's gradual move toward no luck, static setup games, but there is indeed something fun in looking at your initial hand of cards trying to suss out the synergies and the interactions and trying to build a game plan. That part of Agricola DID add a lot of interesting direction to any particular game session.

RATING: 8
It's like Agricola, but I'm enjoying it! 

Seriously. Dispenses with the parts I disliked about Agricola (how hard subsistence could be) but retains everything I did like (engine building, farm construction, a very tangible feeling of progress as the game goes on).

Might run into some repeat play issues due to the lack of any random elements and seemingly some strategies just being good in general (Beer Parlor, 6 Dwarf Rush, etc), but a solid game.

Would love an expansion.

RATING: 9.5
I definitely enjoy Caverna much more than Agricola because I don't feel like I'm constantly struggling to break even throughout the whole game. The adventuring mechanic is really fun, and the game feels more like development and forward progress than disaster management. Although there is competition for adventuring spaces, there are multiple valid strategies for winning, which, to me, makes it a great game

Yes, this is a pretty good game but c'mon, is Uwe in a contest to see how many components he can make in a game or what?

There's certainly more choices of actions than in Agricola but still not enough for my taste.

This re-theme of Agricola is a solid game. I do miss the occupations and improvement cards. I liked that in Agricola each game was unique and that you had to plan your strategy around the cards you had. On the other hand Caverna has more resources to gather, it is less punishing, has the new expedition action and a new scoring system that I love. No more 'you have to do a bit of everything' Now you can focus in breeding only boars for example.

Este es el juego que me hubiera gustado que fuera Agricola.

Me parece un acierto eliminar los oficios/adquisiones,etc y que ahora esten disponibles los edificios para todos. (no tardaran demasiado en sacar mas edificios y/o alguna nueva ampliación).

Pese a tener mucho carton lo veo un poco caro (materiales para 7 personas, no veo como organizar una partida a tanta gente)

Por mucho que la gente diga, si se tiene ya el Agricola adquirir un caverna o viceversa es totalmente innecesario; demasiado similares.

Caverna is in a way Agricola on steroids. You do more, faster, the game is less punishing and it takes longer. Overall it's a good game, perhaps great, but I cannot overlook the fact that yet again a designer is re-engineering his own past games with little innovation.

If this was the first game in the series I would have rated it a clean 10 for what it offers, but in the light of Agricola, Ora et Labora, Glass Road and so on I simply see it with a more critical eye.

The game is quite long in 4-5 players, so a 7-player game would bring a huge amount of down time. IMHO, anything more than five players will be an exercise of patience.

The exploration is the new thing in Caverna and it works really well. Besides that, the rules are written very well, the setup is not that long and the game flows well, it's streamlined and has a somewhat epic finish. I will play it again, most likely retiring Agricola.

I can see why some people call it Agricola 2.0 because it shares some mechanical similarities with it but the experience is quite different IMO. Almost everything eventually gives you points and there are few penalties; this allows for more diversification in strategies and makes it less painful to change strategies during the game. Still, it's hardly the "sandbox" I was told this game was; we were really paying attention to each others' actions and blocking whenever possible. Also, when investing in yellow buildings (which I believe you have to do if you want to earn a lot of points) you lock yourself into strategies that other players should clearly recognize. Great game and highly enjoyable but I'm not sure if I like it better than Agricola. I want to play it a couple of times more before I make up my mind. But one thing is for sure, I'm keeping both!

November 2013:  Picked it up at Essen, without having played it, with first play of Caverna when I got home.

A solid, interesting to play sequel to Agricola that is about 75% Agricola and 25% new material, including buildings, dogs, mines, rubies and expeditions.  Interestingly, this sequel has more harvests, but less stress in feeding your family.  

And Caverna features many more ways to easily earn victory points, every turn. Thus, curiously, Caverna pushes the Agricola franchise in a somewhat Feldian direction: everything earns you victory points! Hey, players undoubtedly prefer it. 

(And for dog lovers, ha, the dogs are fun to have as well, because they can live anywhere on your board and watch sheep very nicely, without benefit of fences!  Excellent.) 

If played competitively, Caverna should become a much more complex, competitive brain burner than Agricola, because there are no hidden cards, or surprising card plays to disrupt your best laid plans or to blame for your loss, and there are more moving parts to play with and more ways to earn VP's.  All the information is right there in front of all the players, in the form of action spaces and various permutations of buildings that can be built to provide interesting resource or VP engines.  So good luck figuring out what the absolute best play is...at each moment in the game.  (I know, but I am not telling.)

In addition, it seems like there are more "combination actions spaces" in Caverna, with dual and sometimes triple actions involved.  Thus, you end up weighing combination against combination a bit more in Caverna than you do in Agricola, a slightly more complex decision than many of the "single action versus single action" decisions in Agricola.  Bottom line: this is a good euro to play, aside and apart from any (obvious) relationship it has with Agricola.  Giving it an 8 of 10.

May 2014:  Going to raise this to a 9 of 10 for its sheer weight of design, replayability, and euro-worker placement complexity.  This is a euro gamers' game of the highest order, or at least complexity of decision making, with a cornucopia of things to get in this game.  

I particularly love the rubies and the ridiculously complicated decisions on what combinations of goods to take on high armament quests late in the game.  For my first action on the last turn of the game, I will use my ruby to violate the placement order rule, so that I have to figure out the optimal combination of 4 goods to take on this list of 12?  Are you kidding me?! : ) Love it.

Feels more static due to the loss of the minor improvements and occupation cards. Also lacks some of the tension from Agricola. I am also not sure about the balance of the exploring part of the game.

So after one play the conclusion is clear: Agricola remains my favorite!

This game is like taking a 5,000 piece puzzle, placing all the pieces face up, round robin picking up one piece. Where each person works on his own section in front of him, like a private mat, the rule being each piece has to fit in with one of his previous pieces. 

This was one waste of money. The artificial high price by MayFairGames and the imposed restrictions forced on resellers not to offer discounts beyond a token amount you have to think hard about buying this game.

Like most of this guy's designs his player count is way off.
5 players is a drag, I can not fathom anyone playing 6 or 7. 

Interestingly you don't hear from the fanboy's reviews anything about this point. 

The price of this game could have been greatly reduced if the player count had been adjusts 3-4. Solo play seems pointless.

For $98.89 plus shipping this was the biggest mistake I have ever made. 

I will avoid both Rosenberg and Outlook/MayFairGames in the future. I don't care for MayFairGames interference with supply and demand.

Richard Ham must be stopped! Yup, his run through talked us into getting this one. Keep in mind it took us many , many months to get it. So ... sadly this one is not for us. Don't get us wrong. It is a very well-thought out game with cool components, interesting mechanics and not nearly as much of the FEED YOUR PEOPLE from Agricola. But it is just a bit too fiddly. There are so many components to keep up with, honestly too many choices to make and it just felt too long.And for those people who say that you can take many different paths to victory I say "Error!" I stuck with one path while my wife did everything. She CRUSHED me. So there goes that theory. Here's the weird thing. We did  really have fun while we were playing it. But once we were done,  had wrestled all that cardboard & wood back into the box, we looked at each other and both said , "Trade." There are people out there who will be able to play this behemoth each and every day and we applaud them. It is a fun game. We liken it to those movies that you enjoy but after you watch it the first time there is no reason to see it again.

Really enjoyed this game.  I think it ranks above Agricola for the following reasons:

#1 The occupation cards give a lot of variation and mean that people have to read so many of those cards (read - too many options).  Not to mention that they are not necessarily balanced, so to mitigate that you would have to draft

#2 The expeditions make the game less tight, and that is good.  The expeditions allow you to do a "grab bag" of miscellaneous resources and can alleviate the issues of not having 1-2 of the exact resource you neeed

#3 The game's theme is more interesting than just a few farmers.

Improves upon the Agricola formula. Feels like Dwarf Fortress: The Board Game. My biggest complaint with Agricola is how stressed I feel to constantly be worried about feeding my family. With Caverna, its not so stressful so I feel like I can think more about long term strategy instead of how to most efficiently stuff bread down my farmer's pie holes.

Definitely seeing more warts with this than Agricola as the low single digit play count increases for me. Still love it, and would still rather play it, on novelty, than Agricola. But I've played Agricola 100+ times in real life, and hundreds more online. Expeditions help in function, hurt in downtime and fiddliness. You have a ton of buildings, most of which are niche at best, and only build a few per game, so it's overwhelming for new players and not particularly dynamic for experienced ones. Finally, the static building aspect can promote settler-quarry type optimization. Despite all this, a super solid game that I'm hyper-criticizing and commenting through an Agricola-is-a-10 kind of lens.

Way better than Agricola, still too cozy for my taste. It feels weird to have complex (well, a bit) games without much player interaction besides "I block this thing now", but then it's better than nothing.

The dwarf combat strength idea is pretty great, I have to admit. Sadly, I would prefer seing it in another type of game. There is a runaway leader problem as well, but hey, we're all playing together as friends, let's just chill, right?

Another masterpiece from Uwe Rosenberg. Enough placement options and unique buildings. I prefer the pressure of feeding from Agricola, but the lighter Caverna is easier to get to the table.

I'll be hesitant to play with five again, very unlikely to play with six or seven at all.
The obvious comparisons to Agricola are present but (after a single game) I much prefer Agricola as the increased choices of action here make thinking about what's worthwhile harder. Leading to much more AP.

Played this with my gaming group and his explanation of this game was Agricola light.  LOL! Man that guy has no idea what Agricola is then. There was a lot more to this game than Agricola.  I enjoyed the play and am interested in playing it a few more times to really get a sense of it. I can't seem to purchase this one since I already have Agricola. Agricola is maddening to my wife since she can't complete everything and I fear this game would only increase that maddening feeling.

So far it's been an OK experience, played only in 2p so I imagine did not yet see the full potential. One drawback is set-up time as you spend almost 20 min setting it up and then another to put it back just so you can have a quick 1hr game (2p). Also, its no luck so it feels like chess  - all the moves are available to everyone at the start

Surprinsingly simple to play. Plenty of action spaces to take. You always take loads of everything; resources, wood, ore, stone. Feeding the dwarfs isn't a big deal, it's usually easy to do it. turns are very fast since at the beginning you just have 2 worker pawns.
Loads of components in a huge box, great quality overall.
Seems very dificult to furnish many cavern tiles, especially with few players.

Finally played: 2 players, 90 minutes. Perfect! Exactly fills the spot that Agricola created. Still has tension and brain-burning, but the absolute devastation that Agricola's too harsh "Feed Your Family" mechanism wrought is gone. So satisfying!

Only problem now is, what to do with Agricola?

RATING: 8
Ugyanannyi pontot adok rá, mint a másik 3 nagy Uwe játékra. Ahogy az Ora = Le Havre 2.0, úgy Caverna = Agricola 2.0. Nehéz lenne megmondani, hogy melyik a jobb.

A törpés felfedezős rész tetszik: egy plusz dimenzió, ami bonyolítja, kombókirályok élvezkedhetnek rajta. Rubin szintén bonyolít és kombólehetőséget ad. Az állatos rész is színesebb, kidolgozottabb, mint az Agricolában. És a kismillió épület szintén, szinte végtelenek a lehetőségek.
Ahol egyszerűsítés történt: nyersanyagok ételre váltása, és a kártyák: gyakorlatilag nincs kártya a játékban, csak a technikai lebonyolítást segítő néhány kártya meg segédlet.
A két játék nehézsége és változatossága másban rejlik. Az Agricolában két parti sokkal inkább eltérhet a sok kártya miatt. Itt ez nincs, de olyan sokféle az épület, hogy szintén nagy az újrajátszhatóság.
Nekünk a 2 személyes volt 2 óra, szerintem a 7 személyes kb. 7 órás lehet ennek megfelelően:) Tuti nem próbálom ki:)
Ami fura volt, hogy az egyik partiban mindketten meg voltunk győződve róla, hogy ki nyer, és mellélőttünk. Nem nagyon lehet érezni szerintem.

A játék közben felmerült egyébként bennem, hogy a kevesebb talán több lenne. Kicsit erőltetett, hogy van arany is meg rubin is.

A játék sokkal kevésbé szűkös, mint az Agricola. Itt a pálya beépítése semmi kihívást nem jelent (2 főnél legalább is), mint ahogy az etetés sem: el nem tudom képzelni, hogy lehet -3 pontot szerezni.

Összességében: jó játék, de nekem egyenértékű az Agricolával élvezeti szintjét tekintve.
---
Kicsit elnagyolt lett a tegnapi, kimaradtak a külsőségek: bazi nagy doboz bazi sok cuccal. Sose láttam még egy játékban ennyi kinyomót... Ennek megfelelően az elő- és elpakolás macera. Ez is olyan, amit nem szívesen pakolnék elő 1 partiért, na de ha 4-5 órás egy parti, nincs mit tenni. A táblákon lévő információk profik. A lapkák sajnos nyelvfüggőek. Egyébként szép.
---
Kipróbáltam a lapka kilógatós taktikát. Sajnos nekem ezzel se sikerül a legendás 140+ pont, de így is stabilan +20-at hoztam vele a szokásos eredményeimhez képest. Durva hogy ennyire erős épületek vannak... Meg kéne kérdezni azoktól, akik sokat játszanak vele, hogy aki megszerzi pl. ezt az épületet, az nem nyer túl nagy eséllyel?

Agricola v. 2.0 - but is it better than Agricola? It seems comparable. It does address some issues on agricola that bothered me, but I cannot judge the gameplay depth yet. Professions and minor improvements are missing and they are fixed buildings now. It is also easier to have stray animals in your farm. Deluxe component are included in the vanilla edition.

First impression favorable. Feels like Agricola, but has some strengths and weaknesses when compared to its parent. Like Farmers of the Moor, feels thematic compared to Agricola. Like Le Havre, most options feel good rather than overly stressful. However, lacks the individuality of Agricola's upgrades/professions, and any blind information relative to your opponents. This makes it slightly weaker than Agricola to my palate. Still excellent.

Caverna feels like a sandbox version of Agricola. Instead of the game mechanics slowly strangulating you, you're much more free do to what you feel like and blocking isn't such a big issue. However, I like my games constricting and tight, so Agricola will remain my game of choice.

Caverna, as far as what you get in the box, is the german response to FFG's coffin games. The box is literally choke full of stuff: tokens, boards, animeeples, vegemeeples, and much more fill a box that's almost twice deeper than Agricola's!

Like any Uwe Rosemberg's big box game released after 2007, Caverna is said to be the new Agricola. But this time the comparison is deserved: Caverna is the closest in kin to the farming game, and they share many mechanics.

Caverna takes many of the problems of Agricola and solves them in an elegant way.
There's no more need for wooden sticks to build fences, and basically there's not any "big" one-shot action at the end (no 15-wood-at-once fences, no maxi sowing).
There's less pressure to grow the family early, and there are more family growth spaces (with one "fixed" at turn 4 - great idea!).
There's no obligation to build any cooking improvement to feed: almost everything can be freely converted to food without constraint.

There is lots of new stuff: new resources (coins, ore, rubies), the need to dig the mountain and shape the cave, the weapons and the expeditions. And a new scoring system, more straightforward and that probably allows more specialization (without punishing too much for not having some kind of stuff).

Overall, the game has less "choke-points" than Agricola, and it feels more open and puts less pressure on players with feeding. The competition with other players is more central than against the game itself, even if competition for some places may not be as fierce as the development paths of players diverge during the curse of the game.

I don't know if Caverna will replace Agricola in the gaming world. And I don't know if it is a better game than its predecessor. But I know they are different enough games to stay both in a player's collection.
And I know Caverna is a darn good brainburning game, that I can't wait to explore in every way...

a new gem from Uwe Rosenberg : In fact it is agricola but it's not a copy or an expansion type of game. It's a complete new game with known and new elements. It's a game where the feeling is right and the will to play it more is very big. My first play was with 3 players and I think that 3 or 4 will be the best. More players will lenghten this already long game a lot.
I really want to play it again
It's been almost a year for my second play : now with 6 players : long, but still very good to play
With 3 or 4 players the game can compeet with agricola so I raised my score to 10. Agricola is in fact a 10+

I am really enjoying this game.  Replacing the cards from Agricola with the buildings that are open to everyone is a nice change that brings more balance to the game (although planning your cards in Agricola is a lot of fun).  Questing is an interesting mechanism as well.  Have played with 5 players and 3 players.  5 players was a tight game that had a similar feel to Agricola.  3 players was much looser than I remember Agricola being at that player count.

I'm impressed that Uwe was able to axe the cards and still keep me interested in collecting wood.  Growing your family still seems just as important as in Agricola.  Blacksmithing at least 1 Dwarf appears the way to be competitive for it opens up your access to furnishing more rooms. 

Update: Choosing amongst the various expedition options slows down the game. I prefer the drafting of cards found in Agricola.

I love this game. A true gem! It seems complicated when you read the rulebook, but when you start to play it is slowly became natural what you have to do at each turn. But! To make a good strategy and find a way to win a game it is not easy at all! There is so much possibility to do in each turn and you have limited turns to do your strategy what make this game hard to play well. I really prefer this game for anybody who loves the strategy games, because this is the best one I every played.

Although this is a good game to play when it came down to it I would much prefer to the variety offered by Agricola. As they are similar, with this being the more recent game all the people who don't like Agricola are unlikely to have played this and so the low scores that those people gave to Agric wont apply to this and so I can understand why this has gone above it in the rankings although Agricola is by far the superior game.

I should love this game. However, the second half of the game has many problems. A gluttony of resources. It is too easy to feed your dwarves. No sense of urgency. Plus, the game itself has too many components to set up and too fiddly. Just a pain really. I realize this is a very well thought of game and I'm my one play was a learning game for all the players, so I'm wondering if a few rules were missed. I definitely want to give this another try and see if my rating improves.

(3-5 players, 30 min/player) The sequel to Agricola, the struggle to build a family homestead takes to the mountains. As a couple of dwarves, you must balance tending to your farm, mining the riches below, and going on adventures to acquire rarities and increase your family's renown. But as before, there's not enough resources to go around, so make good use of your time!

Love this game. Once I figured out a winning strategy, I stopped playing this. But it took me ages to get to that point. Great game. I own both Caverna and Agricola. They are different games but to be honest, I didn't want to go back to Agricola after playing Caverna. Caverna feels like a superior version of Agricola, if you favour skill over luck. The tiles in Caverna level the playing field in a way that the cards in Agricola can be unfairly stacked in the favour of one player.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
First Play: I didn't buy this at Essen 2013 because from what I could see this didn't seem that different from Agricola and I saw no point in having both games in one collection. I was happy to play it when offered the chance and as the game was explained I kept saying, 'like in Agricola...like in Agricola....'. The cavern tiles are like the Agricola cards, the boards are alike but with a cave section, the farming of wheat and veg and the breeding of sheep boars and cows are near identical except there are dogs and donkeys, there is the same competition for the key actions and new actions are revealed each turn, you need to harvest and feed with a slight random mechanic, etc etc etc, its all 90% Agricola with a slight twist for all the mechanics.

Sure its a good game, it works, but Agricola did it all first 5 years before in a near identical format. Its the same car with a different paint job. 7.5 is my threshold to buy a game so this has to be 7. Not because its average, its just a near clone of a game I already own and my first impressions were right, I don't need two in my collection.

I resisted purchasing this as I thought it was just a retheme of Agricola with a few extra touches. I wish I had tried Caverna sooner. The depth of this game is wonderful. The actions are plenty. Lots of variability in strategy and combinations. A fun worker placement game that limits resources but give plenty of alternatives. This game makes Agricola faily obsolete in my opinion. The variability of the cards is gone in favor of tiles that are static options. Other than that, it is an improvement in every other way. Rosenberg continues to refine his craft.

The sheer number of pieces to have to maintain and setup is a major detractor for this game, so you absolutely must get The Broken Token organizer. Game itself is a wonderful sandbox which, while variety game-over-game is limited, is different enough to be rather replayable.

Brett brought this one for our game evening. We played 4 player. I ended up losing by 1/2 of a point, 79.5 to 79. This game takes Agricola, and makes it easier while at the same time increasing the "stuff" you can accomplish. The adventuring mechanism is great add-on. The fight to survive (i.e. get food) isn't anywhere near as brutal as Agricola. That makes this one a winner for me. Cannot wait to give solitaire a spin.

Interesting re-implementation of Agricola.  It basically replaces the occupation cards and minor improvement cars with more major improvements cards (furnished rooms) while limiting the amount of them you can play to the number of playable spaces in your cave (caverns).

Another key difference between this and Agricola is that it is much easier to feed your family in Caverna because you are not required to convert your resources into food.  This change results in a less cutthroat experience.

I have been enjoying learning the nuances of Caverna and would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Agricola or any heavy euro game.

first of not my theme here.i was pretty furious when i couldnt make my pig monopoly in this even i had the tiles that can give you a lot of cash for it. since cash is 1:1 with victory points.it doesnt work like that.you cant breed and sell in this game.what would be fun for me.the game is a big optimalization puzzle.didnt play agricola yet so i cannot compare.i would probably try always play the easy mode on this becouse you can secure som variety in it.the hard mode has all the tiles out so it can get samey over some plays.so replaybility can be a problem with this title.it has a lot of components.you need to take them all out even for a 2p play.and still at the end you get a lot minus points if you dont have this or that.
dont look for dwarfs in this they are only in the manual.

this game dont wow me that much and consider it a bit overrated.

This is a definite favorite in the house.  Did you ever feel when you played Agricola that you were just too limited on you choice of actions?  Say like, "Well I guess the only smart thing to do is plow a field".

What Caverna does is add more things to do without adding more requirements, no more trying to avoid tons of negative points. It also allows you to DO more on a turn as most spaces are "do this and/or that".  You are still pressed to make smart decisions but I never felt the board choosing for me.

The game is too short for what it is. Suddenly it's all over, and you get a bad taste in your mouth. It's like a movie that ends on it's climax because it's getting over 120 minutes or the monney ran out. The game is good, but clearly suffers from the request among gamers that games should not be a long and rich experience. Maybe an expansion will fix the problem and make the game a lot better. Until then I prefer Agricola.

Great game. Rewarding mechanisms and so many different possible strategies. Very well made in every aspect with the exemption of the dwarf theme. Doesn't play out as a dwarf game, it just feels like cave people. And the dwarf artwork feels like somebody's school project. Also it is a bit confusing that the cows and the wood have the same color and similar shape, seems for such a well thought and streamlined game a small snag like that shouldn't be there.

I enjoy Rosenberg's games usually. But definitely Caverna is my kind of game. I'd play again don't get me wrong. But it takes a long time to play.. probably longer than Le Havre. And explaining the game to new players is just too long as well. Much rather play his other designs.

I finally got this game to the table and I'm glad I did.  This is a great game that is best played with gamers that want to play it multiple times.  the gaming experience is really enhanced if the gamers are familiar with the game and the strategies.  This game has one of the essential elements that in my opinion really makes a game fun for me, and that's what  call ownership.  You get to develop your own farm and dwelling and make it better the others.  Essentially your building a family and business (micro civilization) and making it better than the rest.  Smooth mechanics and lots of choices.  The bonus is you can play solitaire too>
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Excellent game with a myriad of choices, but with experience there's a clear distinction of what is valuable at any given point. It can get extremely long with 5+ players to the point it shouldn't be played with 7. Interestingly my recommended number of players is split between 1 and 4 where I believe the multiplayer version of the game really shines.

I love the fact that there are a variety of ways to win as well. When playing with 2+ players, your reactions can be just as important as your actions. Solo, the game is possible to solve, but I still enjoy trying to improve my approach.

I am not sure I like the adventuring part of the game which seem pretty powerful and a must-grab by someone every turn. The rules are also not the most clear on some subjects and the game sure could have come with a useful, full overview sheet.

Also, the design choice to use cardboard circles on top of the wooden discs to indicate weapon strength is insane. the discs don't really stack and the whole process is fiddly. This is a case for using plastic pieces for the family members with indents for the weapon counters so the would be more flush with the surface and less-likely to slide off.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
It's more of a sandbox and less restricting than it-that-shall-not-be-named but there are still moments of eye-popping irritation when someone takes the last spot you needed during the final round.  However, as this is not the whole game, it's much more appealing (at least for me).

If you play one board game incessantly for months on end, you may hit a replayability wall.  We are still really enjoying playing with a variety of different strategies and have just started playing the full game (vs. the intro version).

Absolutely fantastic game.  Get some Plano boxes to reduce your set-up time (which can be epic).

Pro's:

1)  Getting your dwarves and etching out your little cave and farm feels great. Here is a thing you have built and these are the things you specialised in. Almost a style of roleplaying.
2) Aesthetically has some of the most pleasing components in any board game ever.
3) Variety in strategies and the customization options of your cave and farm feels very personal.
4) Surprisingly easy to teach.
5) It feels just as satisfying to win or to lose.

Con's:

1) End point scoring can be confusing sometimes.
2) Due to the nature of the game, being a winner or loser can feel totally separated from the aspects that make the game fun to play. Often times I find I simply don't care if I win or lose and thus find myself playing the game in a very different way to other competitive games.

For Euro gamers this should be a real gem. Loads of options and decisions to make! For me there is too little player interaction. I don't really care about what the other players' strategies are. It feels as if I'm playing the game by myself and at the end we just compare victory points.

How people do find games like Caverna fun still beats me: rather than rewarding you for what you’ve done, such games enjoy punishing you for what you failed to achieve; at the same time, they revel in bullying their players by allowing them to take just a limited number of actions per turn, some of which cannot be chosen at all since someone else simply came before you in the turn order and anticipated your very first move.

Thus you keep taking half-needed, half-satisfying actions until the liberating end you yearned for so long comes at last, no matter the final score.

Playing these games is simply frustrating and quickly turns into an optimization exercise that feels the same as the most annoying office chores: the fun is the same but at least the latter grant you a reward - in the form of a wage - that the former fail to deliver as well. They are just a waste of your precious time and patience.

Yeah, it's Agricola, but it's also a little bit better. Does it get minus for reinventing the wheel a bit? I suppose. But, I had a great time. Taking the special effects and putting them on the buildings was a great idea, and making the personal board play more interesting and varied with the animal types and caves is a good method of introducing variation in a game with little setup changes from game to game. We also found that where Agricola had huge cliffs related to certain actions, Caverna never completely shut anyone out. The frustration is lower, at the expense of a little bit of tension. I focused more on "making my plan work" then making sure I was starting player in Round X to get a new farmer. Oh, and extra dwarves are still good, but not the end-all that they are in Agricola. So, yeah, Agricola, but a little better. Ill take that.

RATING: 7.5
It's a looser version of Agricola.  I really had fun with this.  Instead of card play you have the ability to carve out caves.  In the one game I played the scores were very tight.  I did not adventure at all, nor did I worry about the caves much (except to have my spots covered).  Another person focused on the adventures.  Two others worked on caves and getting points for rooms.  Lots of ways to gain points in this one.  I liked it.  I like that it will play up to seven.  It could be long but who cares...it plays seven.

// This game seems huge, at least until you realize much
of what's in the box is just there to make the game work
for up to 7 players. I would have been totally fine buying
a copy that only plays up to 4 (if such a thing existed).
People typically compare this to Agricola and talk about
whether this replaces that, but I think there's room for
both. Caverna feels a little more streamlined, but I was
not at all a fan of the questing mechanic. It kind of makes
sense thematically, but it really felt like just getting
stuff for not actually having to play the core game.

I have not played Agricola, and I have read many criticisms that this removes the tension of Agricola. I'm fine with that. i actually think there is plenty of tension trying to make sure you grab action spaces and the furnishing tiles you want before someone else can get to them. My enjoyment comes from starting with an empty board and building your farm and caverns up over the course of the game. It's like a big sandbox at the beginning of the game where you have so much freedom to choose what path to take and what to build. I love the feeling of having built something completely unique from all the other players. The components are amazing; some of the best I've ever seen.

Good euro game, sandbox. Expeditions, building the cave and farm, gathering items and the like. It is kind of the game where You need to have a startegy what to do since the beginning so it might be hard during first games. No randomness at all. It is for 2-7 players but more than 4 is a masochism. Set up is annoying. 

Little minus - game forces player to think about food all the time, it can be overwhelming and annoying for some players. You have to include moves to gather food in Your strategy every round. If You don't have a chance to feed Your dwarves You can be in the serious trouble in the end of the game (minus points).

UPDATE - I will never play this game with more than 4 players again :D 

8 - 2,3 players
4 - more than 3 players

Ewe Rosenburg. As with Touko Tahkokallio, Vlaada Chvatil and Martin Wallace, anything from this designer gets my full attention. Our first play (five players but aided by familiarity with "Agricola") clocked in just over three hours, which is good news. We weren't stepping on each others toes to any great degree but with more familiarity that could change. Thank heaven for "Imitation!" I think that four players will be the sweet spot here but I'm encouraged that five wasn't as bad (or as long) as I feared. However, six or seven looks to be too many.

After several plays now the elegance of the design is starting to really come through - I won't yet say for sure that there is a sweet spot for this game: each of my three, four and five player experiences were exciting and enjoyable, and the time length of the game does not appear to be linear as a function of the number of players as often is the case. The arrangement of the action boards for the different player numbers makes each "version" its own game by presenting an interesting balance of action options in each case. 

I had read a little about the "ore strategy, for lack of a better term, and had lots of ore and ruby mines down (complete with donkeys), which I then combined with the furnishing that knocks your food bill down by one food for every donkey in your mines. Needless to say food was no problem and I could use what I had to pay for other things (particularly Imitation). At the same time, I was able to fill all my outdoor spaces with plowed fields and pastures and I had a little of everything by the game end so lost no points for missing things. As well, I armed all my dwarves and built the tile that gives a bonus for each armed dwarf. My final score was 91 which I didn't think was too bad for a first outing. Enough to win? Not quite. Another player scored 96 with a better smattering of furnishings (such as bonuses for animals of which he had many). This is a great game but one which needs to be fully explored as there appear to be many fruitful lines of play to be combined with key furnishings which yield bonus points at the end. I've concluded that the judicious furnishing of your cave is the key to victory in this game along with a key specialization (ideally one that only you are pursuing). I finished with only three dwarves to the winner's four and, as in any worker placement game, actions are golden so his extra actions could have spelled the difference. I would shoot for a minimum of four in future. (Ed note: we just finished a three player game which the winner won with 71 points - making me think we did something wrong to come up with such high scores in the previous game).

The Agricola lineage shines through (not so much "Le Havre") but there are many important differences. I'm thinking that this game is to "Agricola" as "Steam" is to "Age of Steam." There will be those that prefer the tighter and arguably more random "Agricola" for a "gamer's game," while I think the more forgiving nature of "Caverna" lets players concentrate on various lines of play without having the threat of "begging cards" dog their every step. It may be that "the" winning line is out there - we've seen it happen before - but for now I just want to play this again and again. Hands down my favorite worker placement game!

Rather standard euro worker placement. Clearly similar to Agricola, but for me something rather major got lost in this one. Remove the charm and pressure of Agricola and replace it with stacks of up-front complexity and fixed buildings. 

Playtime is horrendous (1 hour per player or there abouts), and it felt much more a case of solve the optimisation puzzle than a game.

I'd be concerned about replayability as the buildings are fixed (although different player number gives variety), but as I don't want to play it again it isn't really an issue ...

I'll stick with Agricola and the other worker placement games I have.

I was a bit disappointed in this one... It's impossible not to compare it with Agricola (the instructions even say, "Skip the first 12 pages if you've played Agricola!"), but taking out the two most controversial aspects: random occupations and feeding people, removes the replay-ability and the tension of the original.

I read a review that said there was an "embarrassment of riches", and that's a good way to put it.  Except for once, I've never seen a person have trouble getting all the resources they need/want.  With three rounds left, many of the players at the table are saying 'What... there's still more?"  "We all have a fully sustainable farm, and now we're going to go through 12 more actions."  "Well, I already have ten wheat, but I guess I'll just get some more then?  I don't know."  

That's not to say there's nothing good here.  The questing mechanic is brilliant, and the strategies with focusing on the quest side or the farm side add a really interesting layer to the Agricola formula.

It's just disappointing how easy it is to get what you want.  With an hour left, the game has lost its challenge, and it's all about throwing more points onto the pile.

Plant, build and go on a raid with armed dwarfs and dogs. Agric 2.0 without cards and thick cardboard buildings. So feeding your clan is not so important here.

Great game that give the player(s) many paths to victory.   Build your crops, your farm, your mining, your cave, your family.    So many options in the game.

Like Agricola, it does penalize you for not completing things, but not as severely.

Some people may look at this game as multiplayer solitaire.   Sure it is solitaire like.   But it has so many options and roads to take that it is an adventure just to see what you will accomplish by the end of the game.

Basically Agricola 2.0 but the games feel pretty different.  The Gric is simpler and at the end of the game your board usually looks similar if you've done well, but the way you get there is different because you have to adapt to cards you were dealt.  With Caverna you can really go in a bunch of different directions and at the end you can have very different boards and still be successful.  I won once doing no expeditions and taking the build a room take a dog space every time.  I had a zillion dogs.  Another time I did a donkey/mine strategy.  It's really cool.  It also lets you run your engine a little longer at the end which I like, compared to the Gric which feels like it ends too quickly.  Comparing the Gric and Caverna has led to some really interesting discussions about game design and what makes them feel different, what one has over the other etc.  To make a long story short, I like Caverna a little better but both are staying in the collection (for now).

I was not expecting to like this.  Although I burned out on it, I loved 'Gric playing it hundreds of times.  When Le Havre came out, it lasted about 40 or 50 before I became tired of what I saw as a single path to victory.  When OeL came out, it didn't even last that long; the huge number of resources and very long conversion paths just didn't interest me.  When I heard of Caverna (and its price tag), I expected more of the same... more bloat, more complexity, not any better gameplay.  I was wrong.

In Caverna, Rosenberg goes back to 'Gric and improves on it.  That may be a bit over-stated.  At the very least he takes what is arguably the best and worst feature of 'Gric (the cards) and moves in a different direction.  There are two primary differences between Caverna and 'Gric.  First the cards are removed and replaced with buildings.  Buildings come into play in a 2-step process.  First, players must lay the ground for the buildings (similar to plowing fields in 'Gric) on a second player board and then, with a second action, players can build a building taken from a shared pool.  The buildings work similarly to Major/Minor Improvements and Occupations.  They give discounts/bonuses/end-game VPs/...  The big difference is there are significantly less of then (~40 - 50) and they are all available to everyone from a shared pool.  I think I prefer it to 'Gric.  I wish there were more buildings (and I'm sure there will be expansions coming), but other than that I like the whole mechanic.

The only other significant change from 'Gric (and this could have been done with a 'Gric expansion) is expeditions.  It is a way for players to get some free stuff and the more times a player takes an expedition action with the same worker, the better the stuff that he can get is.  

My one play was solo so I can't speak for how bad blocking will be.  However, looking over the spaces, I suspect it will be a little less contentious than 'Gric but not much.  

Finally, there are other differences, but while significant to strategy, they are minor mechanic-wise.  There is no longer as much of a need to generalize.  Every vegetable and animal gets you a point, so no need to max sheep and boar.  Get one sheep to avoid the negative (or two so they breed) and then focus on boar (or vice-versa if food isn't an issue).  Harvests occur much more frequently than in 'Gric but I'm not sure if that will have much impact or not (since breeding and field harvest also happen more often).  

Overall, I was impressed.  Resource types are on par with 'Gric.  I like the idea of changing cards to buildings.  Luck of the draw is gone but repeated plays will be needed to see how much replayability there is.  The expeditions provide another spot where player strategy can diverge which may again make action spaces more/less contentious.  If I didn't already have 'Gric, I'd probably choose Caverna over it.  Already having 'Gric, it's hard to justify.  However, I'd be very happy to play someone else's copy.  Initial Rating: 7.5

Se trata de una remake con añadidos del Agricola. Le añade principalmente dos cosas: Las misiones y las cavernas que permiten obtener ventajas de juego o sumar bonus al final de la partida. Por lo demás, si has jugado al agrícola, éste es un juego muy similar.. y como aquél, es un buen juego.

RATING: 8
This is basically Agricola 2.0, but with dwarfs. It's a significant improvement, which is saying something--Agricola is a fine game in its own right. There are five really notable gameplay differences:

First, the unique improvements and occupations are gone, with no replacement. This improves game balance at the cost of making each game more similar. (The decision to lock the Family Growth spot in place has the same effect.) I think it's a good change overall; it's frustrating to lose an Agricola game because your opponent had sole access to an overpowered card. I'm glad that dynamic is gone.

Second, resources can easily be converted from one to another in this game. That's very different from Agricola, which severely punishes you if you are short 1 food or 1 wood at a critical moment. In Caverna, there are lots of ways to fix that instantaneously. This makes the game a much gentler and less stressful experience.

Adding to that milder vibe is the third change, that the spaces are generally more powerful. Everyone's farm tends to look good at the end of the game. It's possible to accomplish a great deal. It doesn't feel at all like Agricola, where everything is desperately scarce. You feel like you're running a flourishing society. 

The fourth major change--and my favorite thing about this game compared to Agricola--is that you can get victory points however you want. In Agricola, you have to diversify and get a little bit of everything to score well. That's just how the game works. In Caverna, you can choose to specialize. Want to focus on sheep to the exclusion of all else? It's possible. I really love this change. I think Agricola's scoring system is needlessly unintuitive and restrictive. Caverna still retains some elements of it (there are negative scores for not having animal types and for having undeveloped spaces) but generally it's a more flexible and positive system.

The fifth addition is the presence of expeditions. You can arm your dwarfs with ore, and then send them out to collect pretty much whatever kind of resource you want. This is an interesting alternate development path. The expedition spaces are usually hotly contested, but there's a twist--armed dwarfs must go last. I think expeditions are nicely balanced--viable but not dominant--and are definitely a worthwhile addition to the game.

I have two minor dislikes about this game. First, it can take forever to wait for your turn to come around again, and this just gets worse the more players you have. Second, for unclear reasons, the designers decided to make the game support up to seven players. Seven-player Caverna is a ludicrous idea (anything beyond four would just be interminable), and this means the game is needlessly heavy and expensive with far too many components. Still, as long as you stick to four players or less, the overall experience is quite good. If the idea of a less stressful, more light-hearted version of Agricola appeals to you, I recommend this game.

RATING: 9.5
Another fantastic Rosenberg game. Very similar to Agricola, but slightly more forgiving and allowing for more dedicated strategic avenues. Also, having all the buildings out removes the element of luck that especially favors experienced Agricola players. The first boardgame I've ever played solitaire; it's that fun that it even can beat out videogame time :)

Update: Played this lots more, and the first board game ever where I've enjoyed even playing solo. In my top echelon of favorite games. Rosenberg just has some magic that completely clicks with what I like in a game.

Like Agricola, this is a top notch worker placement game, but streamlined for a broader audience appeal (my sons). And I like it myself, with the somewhat more generous action selections and forgiving food supply options. Also, it modifies the card play with purchasing the buildings instead of playing cards, even though I enjoy the challenge of drafting cards in Agricola, using the variant. Very engaging gameplay, where we can decide on promoting workers (dwarves) for expeditions or doing other things. Excellent design!
Both games are worthy of top 10 ratings, though similar, I make an exception to my standard of owning games that are essentially remakes.

It is not surprising that Caverna is a great game, because it really is a remake of Agricola. While just one play is not enough, all my boardgaming instincts tell me that Agricola is the superior game: more demanding, more replayable (I love to draft in Agricola) and more thematic. I am also a bit tired of Uwe releasing the same old game every year.

RATING: 4
A reworking of Agricola into version 2.0. Less charm. Less theme. Less tension. Less of the stress that I liked. A long set up. But somehow it was still a decent game.

Update October 2014. Dropped from 7 to 5. 
It really is just recycled Agricola. Not interested in looking at 100 buildings and maximizing grabbing and converting a thousand different types of resources. Feh.

RATING: 8
A great game, with absolutely no direct player interaction, which can be a pro or a con depending on my mood. There are a lot of options to consider each turn, and probably a lot of different viable strategies. I guess the biggest competition will be over the furnishing market, where each furnishing is unique; and over the raiding actions, which seem really strong.

The game scales surprisingly well. With many players it's more multiplayer solitaire: everybody doing their own thing, because there's too much going on to watch all the other players anyway. But even with 7 players we still find it enjoyable. 

The game has a crazy amount of bits and chits. I know many people like those, but I wish there were less of them. It's the only game I have that needs a custom storage solution to be playable without a hassle.

That is one heavy game. Heavy because of its wooden and cardboard masses, heavy because the rulebook could use some restructuring, heavy because of the possibilities...

In the first games you are both impressed and overwhelmed but eventually you'll find your way and try different strategies.
I have to admit that I'm not really good at this game (points below 60) but I like it quite a lot.
My second negative thing about the game is the massive amount of setup time.

Wow...  I still haven't mastered Agricola (or come close to being considered a GOOD player), so it's probably a little bit of a folly to take on Caverna.

Still, I really like the huge number of things that can be done, and the way that different aspects of the game interact.   It seems to me this game could be played a large number of times and still you'd make discoveries.

Rated 8 initially, with room to grow.   Only concern is play time.

Even if you don't know what you're doing, you can still plant pumpkins and breed sheep and pigs. 

Even if you are keeping track of other players and know objectively that you will lose, you can still go on an adventure and bring back a donkey and a sack of gold.

Even if your friend steals the very tile you needed to win the game, you can STILL get some pretty rubies and trade them in for a cow and a dog.

I mean, come on. If that's not the sign of a great game, I don't know what is.

Oh yeah, plus your a family of dwarves.

RATING: 8
I note that some comments and ratings on this site are based not on the merits of this game on a stand alone basis, but whether the writer regards the game as a potential purchase given the fact that he already owns Agricola.  This is rather unfair to the game.

This is not the first 'remake' to hit the market if one can call it that.  I think of Wallenstein and Shogun, Ave Caesar and Ausgebremst, Formel De and its versions, Imperial in its two versions, etc., etc.

There's no doubt that this game is an excellent design with enough changes to provide a new experience.  But it isn't cheap to buy so whether or not you regard the number of changes sufficient to have them both in your collection will really depend on your games buying budget.  Best to try it first.

Our first game had four players.  I admit I didn't find myself as frustrated in carrying out my plans as I often did in Agricola.  There always seemed to be enough alternatives available

Also the initial fear that I would not be able to feed my dwarves never materialised.  Most ended up with four dwarves and nobody failed to feed them.

I do have a criticism with the rule book, which might sound strange given that so much thought seems to have gone into it.  I found it very good at teaching the game but a nightmare to refer to during play when one needed to check up quickly on something.

That first game in which we needed to study all of the building options, all of which were new to us (we played with the suggested limited introductory number), took 150 minutes.

This games basically replaced Agricola for me. I'm a bigger fan of this due to the more relaxed nature. Unlike Agricola where there's the stress for not being able to do everything, Caverna lets you do enough to feel as though you've accomplished quite a bit more.

I bought [b]Caverna[/b] because I am a big fan of [i]Agricola[/i], but there always seems something wrong with [i]Agricola[/i], like it could be a better game.  I was really hoping that [i]Caverna[/i] would fix everything that I felt that was wrong with [i]Agricola[/i].

Now that I have played both, I think I understand what was lacking in [i]Agricola[/i].  I love [i]Agricola[/i] because of the huge variety of improvements.  No two games feel exactly alike in [i]Agricola[/i].  But with [i]Caverna[/i], games do seem very similar because the choice of improvements are the same from game to game.  However, the scoring in [i]Agricola[/i] is unforgiving and limited, and forces you to diversify every single game, but [i]Caverna[/i] allows a player to specialize.  

I think that [i]Agricola[/i] and [i]Caverna[/i] are basically the same game.  If you own one, there is really no point in buying the other.  They are both good games.  However, I do like [i]Agricola[/i] a little better than [i]Caverna[/i].

Agricola with dwarves - so you get to build a cave network and level up adventurers as well as the usual farming activities. I liked both of those aspects and it feels a little tighter and less footery than its predecessor - with more experience I may even prefer it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Played, enjoyed, but even though it plays more cleanly than Agricola, and gives you more interesting options with less screwing around and more flexibility, I don't think it's better.

Firstly, I am extremely suspicious of balance. Mining, looting, and a few of the mining boosters seem extremely strong. I've never seen anyone win who wasn't heavily into mining and got one or more of the three extremely strong rooms (food with donkeys in mines, extra ore for mines, points for ore). Many of the other rooms related to agriculture and husbandry are obviously laughably weak. Also, there seems to be a significant first turn first player advantage.

Secondly, the huge amount of up-front complexity, along with completely open and symmetric information is obviously problematic. With little inherent variability, this will be susceptible to optimal strategies and severe AP. I see the problems he was trying to solve, but this "solution" just introduces a different set of severe issues.

Also, the 7p support is ludicrous and has jacked up the retail for no good reason. Even 5p is probably a little too thin. 6 or 7p would be insane.

So I dunno. We were basically done with Agricola, and Caverna is kind of fun because it gets the system back to the table again with some neat new features. But I expect it to have a short shelf life.

Last thing, while Caverna is pretty playable for Agricola vets, for anyone who hasn't played Agricola, Caverna can be completely overwhelming. Newbies are going to have to plow through several or many games of frustration to catch up.

I understand that there is a huge debate between Caverna and Agricola, long time lovers of Agricola think Caverna is a cheap remake of Agricola, but I think that Uwe Rosenburg made a true masterpiece with Caverna.

First five plays have been very interesting.  High score was only 87 until I got 101 in the last game, with everyone scoring 60+ each time.

Definitely a MUCH better version of Agricola. It had just enough All Creatures Great and Small rolled in for me to thoroughly enjoy it. I wouldn't mind playing it with 4 or even 5, but more than that would be too much. We played it 2 players, which really helped us get the hang of the game. I liked that I always felt I had something I could do, something which Agricola fails on sometimes, especially at such a low player count. I will say, that at 2 players I would rather play All Creatures Great and Small, but as a game Caverna is far superior. I especially like that there aren't that many ways to get negative points, so you can just have fun building up the more fun things in the game, rather than stressing about getting your minimums of everything.

RATING: 8
If you enjoy worker placement/resource management games Caverna is very well designed. It's a bit daunting to bring to a new group, and you spend at least your first playtest fumbling through the steps before you figure out how to run your dwarves efficiently. After about a dozen+ playthroughs I find there are too many buildings, and may of them aren't very useful. And I wish I had more options on the board in a 2 player game. (There are way more options in 3/4 player variants)

Patricia and I played Caverna at a local board game meetup.  I liked it, but there were too many pieces to really understand what was going on during our first play. Patricia didn't understand how ore worked, so she didn't use hers and played the game like it was Agricola.

We played a modified beginner setup, so there were fewer choices on most of the boards (except the last one).

I think I prefer the tightness of Agricola (and I like the cards) but I would be willing to play this game again.

Since three of us weren't familiar with the available buildings and the scoring, it didn't work out well for us. Still, I think a score of 74 was okay for my first try.

The three beginners didn't concentrate on the endgame scoring rooms, and we often had no idea what the other players were doing.

Hector had the Broken Token organizer, and it made a huge difference in setup time. I don't think I'd want to play the game without it.

In terms of game play, and depth of strategy, I would rank this game a 7. However, combined with the natural story telling that occurs from building a physical farm and cave (home) in front of you, as well as the bizarre and wonderful rooms included in the game, it is pushed over the edge, 

I had tons of fun losing at this game, and expect that to continue every time I play it (the fun part, not the losing part...I hope)

I am opposed to any game where I have to get up and walk around the table to get a clear view of all my options. I also felt like it was far to easy to get positive points and I never really had to make any difficult decisions.

It's a very good game. Lots of paths to victory, lots to think about on each turn.

Kudos to Uwe for balancing this game for every player count, never seen that kind of attention to detail before. It's a good game, but I don't think it belongs at #3 all time

It's tough to rate. It is definitely much easier to get into than Agricola if you've played that a lot -  it really does play like an agricola variant. I weep for players learning this one from scratch. The new board split between cave and field is pretty cool. The expeditions are a nice addition - though they massively exacerbate the turn order issue Agricola had with players to your left or right taking start player having a huge influence on your game. That said, there are 48! buildings to replace the cards here, and I'm sure they have interlocking combo possibilities that the nerds will be poring over for years. It is so overwhelming that I essentially ignored them for most of my game, just picking up some extra rooms and end game point scorers. All of the players in my game did - and it still clocked in at a little less than 3 hours for 5 players. At least the game is still very playable without having a deep knowledge of the buildings, unlike games like Ora where they are so essential that you are just lost. In caverna, you can take a couple of games and become slowly more acquainted with the buildings over time, still being able to enjoy yourself and feel you are executing a reasonable strategy for your first batch of games. I think players trying to comprehend all of the buildings on first play is why I am reading about 4-5 hour playtimes. No thank you. 

So, decent first impressions. The game is definitely not as thematically integrated to me as Agricola. But I still enjoyed it. 

One other thing. I would say that, including setup and breakdown and inter-round refills, that about 1/3 of your time is spent on fiddly maintenance stuff. It's annoying.

Many people feel that Caverna has replaced Agricola. Me? I don’t think so. Caverna is a splendid game and one of my favorites, but it’s simply just not as good as Agricola. There are multiple reasons for this (feeding is not as hard and intense, the setup is almost the same each game, the gameboard is too open etc).
Contrary to Agricola, a game in which you need a bit of everything in order to score a lot of points, it’s easier to diversify and follow different strategic paths (due to the various buildings, expeditions, rubies and the fact that almost everything scores 1 point each with no cap limit). I guess that’s one of the (few) advantages Caverna has on Agricola, and it’s the thing I like the best I guess; your farms look different from each other, whereas if you have a competitive farm in Agricola, they tend to be similar, although the way you built your farm might vary.

The expeditions are another thing I love about Caverna! The forged weapons you use to go on expeditions make family growth a lot less desirable. It’s no longer a must (as it is in Agricola) due to the fact that you can get a lot of actions with a few dwarves equipped with strong weapons and due to the fact that each dwarf only gives 1 point (which almost everything does in Caverna, which makes it easier to understand and calculate scores) of about 60-120 or so depending on the number of players. It’s also a good idea that you can block the family growth spot even though you aren’t going to get an extra worker; it adds some extra strategy to the game (and I like that later on in the game another family growth appears). It’s also nice that you now know when the first family growth appears, and in games with more players it’s even available from the start of the game!

One thing I dislike is that if you don’t go with armed dwarves, there is only one crappy action spot where you can build buildings – and the buildings are powerful! What is brilliant about Caverna is the fact that there is a spatial element; you need to carve out the cave in order to build additional rooms. I think that this is a very nice addition. It does seem, however, that some buildings are never ever built whereas others are bought in almost every single game… And that’s a little sad. Some of the yellow buildings are extremely powerful and if you don’t get a couple of them it’s hard to win.

And speaking of these buildings, they are the equivalent of the occupations and improvements in Agricola – but whereas Agricola has 10 cards which appear in every game and a gazillion of cards where just a few are drawn randomly each game, there are only 48 buildings in Caverna, and they all appear in every single game. This means that the variety and replayability is decreased and vastly inferior to Agricola, and that’s a huge bummer. I’m fairly sure that a couple of buildings haven’t been built in any of my 18 playthroughs… Yes, I know that they are situational and sometimes they might work, but I’d rather stick to build those buildings I know are great! And those yellow bonus buildings are so crucial, and with higher player counts they are highly contested. Oh, and I’ve never lost a game in which I’ve built the food chamber, and I’ve played against very experienced Agricola players. That building has given me more than 20 points a lot of times, and I’m pretty sure that I scored 40 points with it once as it’s so much easier to plant and sow in Caverna than in Agricola!

However, Caverna is way too forgiving and loose. It’s simply too open with especially 2 and 3 players (3 players even having 3 more spots than the 4p game?!), so it’s almost impossible to block your opponents – there are always a lot of good actions to choose from. In that sense Caverna feels more like Le Havre than Agricola. Besides the fact that there are too many open spots, there is not at all the same tension about feeding your family because it’s so easy to get food. Yes, there is a feeding phase after almost every round, but it’s so much easier to get food, and get a lot of it, so it doesn’t really hinder you too much. Maybe in the beginning of the game before your engine kicks in, but in the middle and at the end of the game it’s not too hard. And that’s sad, because the tension of the tight gameplay and feeding phase and the fact that some actions are highly contested are all reasons why I love Agricola and why it’s such an awesome game. 
So while Caverna has removed some of the features I like most about Agricola, it has also added some cool stuff (expeditions, spatial elements, streamline the point system). 

I think Caverna is best with 4 players, although 5 and 3 are fine too. As it takes about half an hour per player, I probably won’t try it with 6 or 7, although I would like to try it one day. Caverna is a great game (cf. my rating), but it doesn’t replace Agricola. Not by a long shot.

I just would much rather play Agricola instead, both for the theme and because of the irritation in Caverna of having to sift through a huge number of potential improvements to build at the start of the game (and having only one copy of each). I'd rather be guided a bit by the luck of the draw.

I may be jumping to a 10 rating early but I was very impressed with this game, and I went in skeptical. The decision making is well done, with many of the actions providing multiple benefits. Probably my favorite addition so far is the ability to upgrade weapons for a dwarf, it just adds another dimension to the game. Like Agricola there are many options to victory, but in Caverna all information is visible to other players. I question the replay value of this game without the card play Agricola offers, because the setup for Caverna is basically the same every time. I can't wait to explore this game more!

As everybody else has said, this is a lot like Agricola, so much so that it hardly feels like a new game.  I think Caverna is missing some of the tension from Agricola: the decision space is just too wide open.  In may ways Caverna is better, but ultimately, I think it isn't as good as its predecessor.

Pretty much a sequel to Agricola. Same basic gameplay of worker placement, revealing actions, family growth, feeding your family, and breeding your animals. I really enjoy some new aspects such as 1) an easier scoring system that makes more sense 2) less points for family members so you are not punished for not getting to 5 actions 3) most actions are to do two things, which makes for more "getting stuff done" 4) the addition if rubies as a wildly flexible resource 5) more harvests which means more breeding/growing going on. Food is still tight, but while getting food you are also doing other things. The thing I like most though, is how you attach a weapon to an action disc and then the most powerful discs go last, creating a tension of hoping a juicy space stays open long enough. However, I do miss the cards and the fun combos, and prefer that over the public first-come one shot buildings that replace them. The rules for The new animals are also a bit fiddly, but the dogs watching the sheep make up for it. This makes a strong case for me to like it more than Agricola, but I'm not sure yet.

I like it better than Agricola. In fact, this is my 2nd favorite Rosenberg game behind Ora et Labora.

I didn't care for Agricola. Too harsh, with the first player spot too important, and I never liked the cards. I found the game frustrating and did not like the rush at the end to homogenize and get a little of every resource.

Caverna basically addresses all my concerns. So why am I not more enthusiastic? Because if I'm going to play a game of this length, with this many pieces and of this complexity, I'd rather play Ora et Labora. In Ora, the placement of buildings is more interesting, the richer playground of resource conversion provides a better "sandbox," and I actually find Ora et Labora more thematic. I feel like I built and accomplished something in Ora. In Caverna, I feel like I simply followed a path that was available, if that makes sense.

Nevertheless, more plays may change my mind, and I'd happily play this again.

Update: played this with six players... ugh. Now, my group might be fairly slow playing, but four hours is not the way I want to invest my time in this game. I'm thinking four players max if I play this one again.

RATING: 6
Caverna certainly retains most of the same aspects of Agricola, but it adds a bit more to it by allowing you to conduct adventures with your workers to gain additional resources. This ultimately makes the game a little easier in terms of feeding your family since these extra small actions can help you get something without taking another action. It's also easier to convert just about any resource into food without needing an oven or extra action to do so as well. However, the game also opens the decision space giving you buildings to add to your cave instead of a hand of cards, which are available to all players from the start. Caverna is a solid game providing a slightly different spin than Agricola, but although while the game feels easier in terms of keeping your head above water each round, it also removes the turn 1 focus that the cards from Agricola give you making starting harder in my opinion. I will typically be happy to play this one, but don't ever see a need to own it given that I have Agricola.

While the art and theme are beautiful, it doesn't quite capture the feel of the Harvest Moon series of videogames which I really hoped it would - as written. Saying that, however, the thematic implementation surpasses that of Agricola, and the sense of building a personally-tailored cave system/working farm is much higher.

Plenty of action options make it less aggressive than its predecessor. I would have perhaps liked to see less resources granted by secondary resource cards, but given the variety in those offered by player count, perhaps a few substitions will easily rectify this.

I believe it should always be played with an expanding, but randomly chosen, selection of room tiles, to increase gameplay variety and encourage very different strategies.

I would like to have seen some tiles that focused in the waterpools/river on the board, perhaps variable bad harvest events, some tiles that can *only* be built via expeditions/quests, starting board feature layout, and think it is a damned shame that mushroom farming in the caves themselves wasn't explored. Dogs too could have been given a slightly stronger role. But... always a chance some of these things might (hopefully) crop up in expansion plans! A substantial list, but all relatively minor, when you have a game as solid as it is.

This is a really great game, but (for now) I have to give the edge to Agricola. The tightness of that game forces you to pay more attention to your opponents. Also, instead of the 50+ rooms available at the start of Caverna, Agricola gives each player 14 unique cards. The cards and rooms act very similarly giving you bonuses or upgrades for actions, and end game points for meeting requirements. Since the same ones are always available in Caverna, you can go for the same path each time. Whereas the limit in Agricola forces you to evaluate a totally different set of cards and try to figure out new combos and explore different paths to victory each time. I enjoy that puzzle a bit more.

RATING: 9
If Agricola is a grueling race, Caverna feels like a leisurely stroll with a sample platter of delights at every turn. They both offer me a great Uwe Rosenberg design. Where Agricola feels like it straddles the fence on being both game and stressful driving push to the finish, Caverna feels like the fence it straddles is between a game and simply an experience. Both have their place for me. Caverna gives me more time for satisfying engine building vs Agricola though less tension getting there.

RATING: 8.2
Interesting.  Uwe loosened up Agricola so much that the choices seem to spill over the sides.  I wouldn't say this game is easier, but I'm not sure its better either.  

Still, I'm happy to explore it.  I'll update this after 5 or so more plays.  

Okay, I've got a few more plays down.  I'm feeling weirdly inspired to write a review.  

Notes towards a review:
This game is not Agricola and it's not like the other worker placement games, where the design space has been rigorously tightened to produce tension.  No, that design path perhaps saw its apotheosis in Vanautu. Caverna is nothing like that.

No, despite the player boards Caverna is an overt attempt to bring us back together.  It is a wonderful combination of pure and mixed strategies that offers the players opportunities for truly sadistic play. 

Of course, none of this will be apparent to the casual player where the game  will seem endless forgiving and open to nursing their poor position.  Such players will always loose.

This is a great game for anyone who wants to build their own village and farm. You can choose a multitude of strategies to gain your points. The first game you will be lost for what to do, but after that you will know how to score points. You don't have to farm at all to feed your dwarves or score points, or you can devote almost exclusively to farming if that's what you want to do. Every game you can try a different strategy, or you can refine a strategy. It can take a long time both to set up and put away. The box says 30 minutes per player although it can take longer if someone suffers from analysis paralysis. Overall, a fantastic game. I would recommend this to anyone willing to devote at least two hours to a board game.

After playing Caverna a few times, it's clear that it is a much "tighter" version of Agricola. The granularity has been reduced (meaning that you need fewer actions to achieve the same end). The early game is much less brutal than it is in Agricola, and I feel like the replacement of cards with buildings makes for a more balanced game. The mining is a nice addition to the agricultural aspect of Agricola. The only real complaint is that some aspects feel a bit more "gamey" than one might expect (especially rubies' role as wilds), but that's to be expected to some degree from a euro. All in all, a great game with a lot of ways to victory and much less of a point salad than you'd think.

The game itself is nice, but playing it solo (and that's what I do) soon gets dull, since there is no element of luck or any other variable in the game. 

So once you've figured out what strategy gives you the most points, it immediately looses all replay value. At least it did for me. 

BUT, as I mentioned in the beginning, this is only valid for the solo game.

Overrated and bloated.  No match for Agricola.   Still a good game in itself, but I fear Rosenburg has started to enter into a state of decline as a game designer.  There is too much in this game.  Lacks elegance and tension.  Player interaction is minimal.   Maybe I will enjoy this game after more plays, but I doubt it.  I'm starting to think that BGG rating system is skewed somehow in that the cult of the new takes precedence over actual quality of gameplay.  I'm thinking about limiting my game purchases to games that are at least five years old in order to avoid this deplorable situation.  Certainly does not belong in the top ten as it lacks freshness and feels like a less effective rehash of Agricola.

Update: Finally busted out my own copy and played again, after reading the rules for myself and getting everything straight. And ok, yeah, it's better than I first gave it credit for. But this is one of those rare games where you really should just start with the base game. Unlike something like Through The Ages, the full game in Caverna doesn't add any significant new concepts, it just adds more tiles that can be purchased. And looking at 20+ possible tiles that can be purchased, all from the get-go with no progression (like Le Havre) is simply overwhelming. I played my first game with the advanced version, the second game with the introductory version, and have no desire yet to go back to full version. Maybe after a few more plays.
---
1 play so far. Probably too early to rate, but I did it anyway. Played the full version without pre-reading what all the things you can build are. Wow, that's a wall of options. Unlike Agricola, where occupations an minor improvements are randomly selected each game, or something like Le Havre where a large selection of buildings are gradually introduced, in Caverna you have [b]fifty[/b] options of buildings to build, right form the get-go. Thud. That's the sound of most people's jaw hitting the floor. I was a bit surprised by how samey it was to Agricola, despite already hearing that from others. It's really Agricola 2, for better or worse. Although it's not strictly stuff added (e.g. adventuring, digging out your house before building in it), it's also stuff subtracted (room material type upgrades, building fences--in fact the layout of farms/fields matters now almost not at all, which is a bit odd, given that you still have to do it). Withholding final judgment until I do my homework and spend the time to learn all the buildings.

A very refreshing retheme/reboot of Agricola, much quicker (no overburden with all the cards), and with 7 players support.

A very very good worker placement game, much better than Agricola in my opinion, but it lacks the "family" variant of the aforementioned.

Much more Agricola V2 than Le Havre or Ora & Labora ever can be. I regret to say that the game is wasted on me, as I'm not much fond of the parent game, and it can still all bog down in a remorseless fight for food and blocking actions before others can. In addition Caverna does away with the puzzle aspect of the cards which tests your ability to 'reprogram' the action cards while the game is in progress; instead simply offering you a bunch of action buildings and 'looting' resulting in free reign to [i]augment[/i] the core of the game. 'Agricola' is now much more a regular economic snowball game. I suppose that pleases many who pleaded with Uwe to create a game where you could actually do something with all your actions... but at the same time it also drives home rather painfully—for me, that is—that Caverna is the game some, and perhaps many, people actually wanted in the first place. I think that a little sad: we already have tons and tons of these engine games, and one of the most defining aspects of Agricola is also the first to be chucked out the window.

In any case, based on my fight with the system: If you didn't like the food fight and action blocking in Agricola then Caverna is also not for you. That much stays the same. If you didn't mind them, then you need to look elsewhere to find out whether Caverna is for you or not. Oh, and everyone can question the wisdom of the publisher to needlessly hike the price of the game to include material for 6 and 7 players when it is fully obvious that noone in their right mind would ever want to play the game at that number. But I suppose there are morons who insist that having a group of 7 is better than two groups of 4 and 3 and subsequently put Caverna out.

Wspaniała gra, która pochłania na wiele godzin. Mnogość taktyk i możliwości sprawia, że gra absolutnie się nie nudzi. Jedna z niewielu gier zaawansowanych, w którą można grać nawet do 7 osób (co oczywiście wydłuża czas rozgrywki i wymaga duuużego stołu). Hodowanie zwierząt, ulepszanie jaskini, rozbudowa rodziny, uprawa roślin i szeroko pojęty rozwój gospodarstwa sprawia ogromną satysfakcję, nawet jeśli ostatecznie przegramy grę. Wtedy widać jak na dłoni, co możemy w przyszłych rozgrywkach zrobić lepiej. Praktycznie losowość jest tu zerowa i wszystko zależy od naszych decyzji i poczynań. Elementy są solidnie wykonane, ma się wrażenie, że jest ich nieskończona ilość! Jedyna wada to długi set-up, koniecznie trzeba zakupić/zrobić wypraskę i posegregować elementy (na szczęście szybko to zrobiłam), żeby jak najszybciej móc rozkładać tą wspaniałą grę. Jedna z moich ulubionych gier zdecydowanie, obowiązkowa pozycja dla fanów eurosucharów i śrubowania coraz lepszych wyników.

Given the choice between this and Agricola, I'd probably choose this.  The game play is very similar to Agricola's but has one awesome difference: you can go on dwarf quests/adventures which gives you extra opportunities to build and get things.  There's only one way to get pumpkins and cows: exploring!  So much fun.  The only downside is that it is a bugger to set up, so many pieces.  But worth it!

Fairy lake is fun - gives big points and an extra turn (but if spent is not worth any points).  Also adds bonuses to pumpkin harvests, etc... Very whimsical.

Caverna is a very solid game.  It is more streamlined than Agricola, but lacks the re-playability feel that Agricola gives.

RATING: 1
Man, I loathe this game. It is right up there with Monopoly.

Why do people dislike this thing but rate it N/A? Look at the comments. Gee, post a rating to unskew the ratings.

I made the mistake of buying this and then playing another copy and realizing the mistake.  

This is from a reviewer about another game but it sums up this yet again rehash from this phone it in designer, "....epitome of inelegant, kitchen-sink designs that leave me feeling cold after hours of slogging through what feels like a meaningless point salad of mismatched mechanisms.

The worst is getting sucker in by reviews and the hype.

One of the most expensive regret buys I have ever made. Despite the publisher's price fixing in the U.S., artificial pricing, this thing is a nightmare to unload and try to recoup your cost. 

It is a niche buy. Those that wanted it, payed up, those that didn't, don't want it, what is left are those that expect to get a mint unplayed copy for $45, shipped, I kid you not. Back out after back out when they discovered the $18.00 shipping on this cinder block.

This behavior of publishing a game that "is not for everybody ", Mayfair words, posted here, in terms of that $98.99 manufactured price, not only causes it to be hard to sell, but also skews BGG's rating.  

It is like that Magic card collecting, Dice Masters. These people willing to spent a fortune on it, will vote their life style high up, not so much say for a game like Airlines Europe which who get a mixture of buyers aka a better sample of buyers, and a more balanced rating. 

Running a poll on 100K Lamborghini buyers on how they like their car is a moot point. They were in love with the designer, the car before going in, before the purchase.

Interestingly, same group that just loves this game are the ones that wanted an expansion to it 1 month after owning. What the hell is that all about? You read,"well if it had this or that", "I sure wished it had", to add some variation, yet 10 rating from these people. Read some of the glow job comments, I have never seen a game so loved by a group and yet that same group want so many changes to. A game that cost 2 cents less then $100.00 should have longer legs, not need expansions. 

Look at the N/A comments rating, amazing so many dislike this thing but fail to give it a rating so it would reflect the real rating. What is wrong with these people? 

Thoughts and just bad vibes after playing this, factoring the money for it:

I'm done watching Dice Tower reviews they are just too skewed to personal "like" of the reviewer, I'm done with this designer. There is a feeling of cranking out the reviews, there is a strong feeling on a one game played review, to keep up with the status quote. A problem I guess when this is now part of your income? I prefer more of a hobbies review.

I don't have the luxury of getting free games to review nor do we have those wax poetic FLGS to try before you buy. Our shops are more of the Comic Book Guy. So, I need a better review, with some real insight in the game. 

I really wonder how often this thing hits the table. To me it's a groaner, "do we have to play that". 

An amazingly dull, flat, repetitive game. There is no direction in this game. This is just a church groups activity, it is no game.

The real deal is you don't seem to be playing against other players, only yourself and trying to beat your easily obtained score by 1-2 points. Seems to be totally missed by any review of this thing. The lack of any real randomization just added to this besting your last score. 

As for Dice a Towers over blown love for this thing, why is it Egyptian themes, Mediterranean trading themes get no love, only because you have played more games and thrown them away then most people will ever own; you never grow tired of just another rethemed, get this or that, no real reason, now trade those in, that is all it is to it resource management; and yet again with this guy, this so called game; a piss poor, erroneous in real play, player count on the box; or you never tire of yet another small variant of Yahtzee game with another theme slapped on? 

I can't wait for the fixed priced $50, 2 player game only Caverna, if history repeats itself, created by pulling out some boring mechanism out of this penny a point salad from McDonald's $1.00 menu. The worst Euro cube pusher has nothing over Caverna's mindless, directionless game play. 

Totally amazing Dice Tower's loathing of Feld's games but the way over the top of this ilk of games especially from at his designer. It is like buying the same puzzle with a different theme for $100.

To Dice Tower, I'd rather play Shadow Era over Caverna. I would like to say I would like my $100 plus back, but I can't, sold for $65 dollars plus 2 $15 mini expansions, one for Caverna, one for another game  just go get rid of it. 

Yes, quite a lost. I figured I got $35.00 for it. You best know you want this thing given Mayfair Games business model of price flooring and slapping on any MSRP price they think they are entitled to.

I finally realize with this game Dice Tower reviews are basically infomercial and are nothing more.

Game is fine but there is just a lot of going on here. Tons of stuff to look out for. I don't think it's bad thing that you have a lot to choose from but it's not good either. Had a pleasure to play with player who has serious AP (analysis paralysis), game just took forever to end. It's just too much for my taste. Constant refilling of materials/animals/food on cards gets more like a chore than a fun game. Turn after turn after turn....just not my cup of tea.

Aka Agricola II. Just like Agricola only its easier to feed your family. The theme has changed slightly. I can see that we will not play Agricola much any more. This appears to be overall a better game that Agricola. 

This has become our favorite game this season. This game offers many creative ways to win.

This game meets the criteria for a truly epic strategy game. I study tactics and strategy before playing. We always spend time after the game talking about each other's strategy and what worked for them. There doesn't seem to be any luck in this game; if I lose its because I was out-played.

Decided to give it a run and see what the fuss is about.  A bit of a spoiled for choice type game, in my opinion.  It lacks the feeling of 'scarcity' that I know and love from Agricola.  

Despite having harvest near every round, I never felt the need to more towards harvest, or take specific actions to meet it.  This is because of the presence of so many easy 'trade for foods' and the wild card that is rubies relieving all tension of 'having enough' after things like oven's were effectively removed.  Yeah it isn't fun to give up resources, but the don't feel hard won.

Other than that , there is an unorthodox amount of tiles for this game, which makes it exceptionally fiddly.  Set up and tear down are absolute bears, which could be rectified with some custom story solutions (which would be a lot of work in this case).  

Overall, I do not feel this lives up to the hype at all.  I think the 'toy factor' due to the excess chroming (which eats my table) really detracts from this.  Not an experience I look to repeat.

Sign me up for another round of Agricola, I feel it is infinitely more enjoyable.  Firmly in my rather not play again pile.

Caverna is a game that will give you the whole "look at all this wood and cardboard on the table" feel where it will get you mildly queasy on first play, but then it strokes your stomach and says "baby there ain't no reason to feel like dat".  This is super fun.  If this had cards instead of tiles it would be better but is great as is.  There are so many ways to win this game and the scoring is plain fun to do at the end of the game.  Get this (and a back belt).

This does seem to be a better version of Agricola.  I like the fact that there are more options for getting resources.  Since all buildings are available for public viewing and purchase, it eliminates the luck involved in getting good Occupation and Minor Improvement cards in Agricola.  I also like being able to convert grain and animals into food immediately without having to buy an oven first.  Feeding your family is much less stressful and does not interfere with your strategy as much.

Absolutely fantastic. Takes everything I love about Agricola, kills the randomness aspect (and occasional unbalance) that was caused by the cards (and could only be partly controlled by drafting cards) and yet still remains very complex thanks to the crazy number of buildings available. It also makes winning possible via a lot of different strategies (bonus points, mining, farming, animals, expeditions etc.), while Agricola narrowed the range of strategies due to the way scoring worked.

My only purchase from UK Games Expo and the highest BGG ranked game I own so my hopes were high. Initial thoughts from one 2 player play through. 
1 I set the game up to try a few rounds to get the feel of it and some understanding of the rules so that the game would flow better when we introduced the kids to it (they hate stop/start rule checking - but don't we all!}. Started with beginner layout for buildings. In the end we completed the game and the time flew. This was good as we got 'into' it.
2 KIV there are LOADS of bits - set up and take down are events in themselves.
3 Lisa was disappointed that the round cards are limited in number and the options available will not vary unless the number of players varies. We will have to see if this is problematic for us and if replayability is hampered by always having the same cards. 
4 I was afraid that it may have been too heavy a game for us however play was relatively intuitive. We have not played Agricola but after watching a couple of videos and the rule book we cracked on and I am confident we got most things right.
5 Our scores were pants 43 v 45

Judgement is reserved on the game - it will depend on subsequent plays and whether the enjoyment remains and indeed increases. It is certainly good but I really want it to be great not least due to the price point. Component quality is fantastic although I would have liked dwarf-like characters I could get emotionally attached to and that could hold the expedition shields rather than the round counters supplied. 

Update : further plays have revealed this to be a grower. Even in 2 player games trying to increase your own personal score (even if you lose) is rewarding. The variety comes with playing different player numbers which opens up different options. We have played with 2,3 and 4 so far and each feels different. We feel that there are still lots of strategies to try.

Caverna is a masterpiece because it excels in so many aspects. No matter what kind of game you like to play, you will find something enjoyable about it.

Casual players: look at the gorgeous artwork, the vibrant colors and all the cute animeeples! You don't need to play to maximize points; just build the farm to your heart's content, bread lots of animals and mine the caves to get shiny gems. You will build a unique homestead every time, and it will always looks good. You will feel like an accomplished entrepreneur who turned an empty field and primitive cave into a cozy home and thriving farm/mine.

Competitive players: the number of choices to make is mind-boggling. You can focus on farming, animal husbandry, gem mining, questing or any combinations of them. Your opponents may try to block you, but you can always take another path. At the same time, there is a large collection of rooms, each of which provides a unique special ability. Building the right rooms at the right time can give you a significant boost, but which one is right is never obvious until the very end. The large variety and endless choices mean that you will not find a dominant strategy or a few set paths.

Great game, I've played both this and Agricola and for me this just edges out as the better of the two. Loads of stuff to do and ways to win. Even though the game play is 90 min+ with 3 players you'll be finding yourself wishing for more turns!

This is in many ways streamlined from the original, which I hope will make it easy to teach.  Unfortunately, there are many technical rules about keeping animals that may balance out some of the streamlining, and these rules are not reflected on any of the player aids.  

I haven't played this enough times (or with enough player counts) to have a preference between this and the original yet.

Not as intense or unforgiving as Agricola, which makes it less interesting to me. The huge variety of approaches can make each game different, but it seems to me that if you find a good strategy there’s really nothing to stop you from playing the game exactly the same way every time. Set up and take down is a bear, and keeps it from getting played as much as it should. Regardless, I find Agricola and Feast for Odin to be much more interesting, and Caverna is very much an occasional play.

Minecraft: The Board Game. After one play, I can say that I like it better than Agricola, but that may just be because I've played Agricola so much that's it's getting stale. I like how this one adds a couple of interesting side games (forging weapons and expeditions as well as the "cavern" side of the player board to develop). The scoring is improved in that there are fewer negatives, so one doesn't have to focus so much on "a little of everything", (although that still seems to be a viable way to win). 

Another excellent Uwe Rosenberg game with wonderful components (although severely overproduced) and excellent scalability for different numbers of players. Why did they not include a player aid that covers end-game scoring?!

I don't think it's worth owning, given that I've already got Agricola with the Farmer's of the Moor expansion. This is very close to the same game as those two, and I feel that it would get stale after a few more plays just as Agricola did. 

Update: Now, 3 plays in (all 2-player), and I think it's as fun as Agricola. I traded for it, and I still own Agricola plus FotM. I'd like to play it with more players, but I fear that it would drag too long at the upper end with inexperienced players.

Very solid Uwe Rosenburg game. We like it a lot with two players and have played once at three players as well. I think it is ridiculous that this supposedly plays with up to 7 players and I would never try it at that player count. We did not like how punishing and cutthroat Agricola could be at two players so this is much better for our carebearish nature.

If you've played Agricola, you've essentially played this game. The experience, the feel and the sorts of decisions you'll be making are more or less identical to Agricola.

But is it an improvement on Agricola? Not really, since my favorite feature of Agricola was the variation provided by the Occupation and Minor Improvement cards.

In Caverna, there is no such variation, but it's still a very playable and enjoyable game.

I've docked an additional half-point off my rating because I feel this game is really much too derivative. (And I really wonder if the essence of the new mechanics couldn't have been implemented simply as an Agricola expansion/variant.)

Put me in the camp that prefers Caverna to Agricola. In the latter, the cards really are necessary to make the game replayable, and they bog things down, at least with my group. There's also too much focus on feeding, which is much less stressful in Caverna. The only variable elements in Caverna are the sequence in which the new actions emerge and the rounds after which harvests occur. Let's hope that those elements, plus all the new possible strategies stuffed into the game, will create variability from play to play.

This is Jane's most favorite game, she likes the overall theme of dwarves and the feel of creating self-sustaining dwarven household (read: well-oiled victory point machine). I like it too, only drawback i see is the increase of play time with more players. We played it with 6 and the last 2 turns were almost unbearable. Hope this will get some major expansion in near future tho.

In the first 10 days of owning this game, we played it 15 times.  We literally didn't take another game off the shelf.  

11/16/17 Update:  As we played it probably more than 50-100 times (sorry I didn't log them all!), I've realized a couple things:

1)  It becomes exceedingly obvious that it is very difficult to win with only 3 dwarves (opponent has to make mistakes) and it is impossible with 2.  Thus, there is always a race for people when I wish other strategies would be more viable.  My wife and I played with a house rule of starting with 3 dwarves and not being able to add another through the game for our last 10 games of this, and it opens up entirely different strategies.
2)  There are just some tiles in the game that are worthless and no one ever buys (except maybe a couple that new people buy that don't realize its a wasted value).  It makes me wish they'd rebalance those tiles to help even their value with the others.

It's still a 10 in my book as I will always be willing (and want to play) a game of this, be it 2 player or 6 player.  It's easily my favorite game I own of our collection of ~100, just still has its flaws.

Caverna is a gamers game, and I think overall it's another exellent effort from Uwe.  The setup and tear down is huge, and the added complexity wasn't really convincing me that Agricola is now 'out dated'.  In fact, I think I still see myself getting more plays of Agricola in versus this one.  A solid game, but Agricola is staying put on my shelf for the foreseeable future.

Being an Agricola fan, I was initially excited to play this title. But quickly stories came out that it was just a watered down version of the base game. Nearly half a year passed, and I started hearing rumblings that it did actually stand on its own, and some people considered it better than Agricola. So I sought it out and tried it. Happily, I can say that I do quite like it, and I do think it deserves to take up shelf space (something I cannot say about the vast majority of new games). It's not better than Agricola to me, but that's ok -- it's more than solid, and brings enough new to the table to be something I will continue to seek out.

RATING: 8.5
I was never interested in Agricola because of the farming theme, but for some reason I decided to buy Caverna. I'm glad I did - it's a brilliant game with great components and despite being a little more chilled than my other favourite WP (dungeon petz), it can get very vicious.

Let down slightly by the infinite ore exploit, but the core of that involves swapping back and forth in a way that is literally only beneficial if you are doing the exploit, so just say you can only swap in one direction per turn and you're all good.

More complicated than agricola, but less complex; broader but not quite as deep; more food needed, but easier to scavenge from the board.  A fresh take on what Agricola does, it comes across as a bit friendlier, and is a fantastic game; my only complaint is (all together now) the lack of cards.

Wow, Agricola on steroids!  I really like it.  If you like Le Havre over Agricola, you will also prefer Caverna over Agricola.  Imagine Agricola without minor improvements or occupations, but instead it has 60 major improvements (instead of 10).  While that is still a lot of fun, I prefer how Agricola provides more variability with fewer cards...making each game different.  In Agricola, I only have to worry about the 10 major improvements plus my 14 cards.  Scanning over 60 potential purchases in Caverna is quite daunting.  I suppose an upside for some will be that everyone has access to the same cards. So for those who are averse to bad card draws or bad drafting in Agricola, this will be a positive to Caverna.  I do worry though once I memorize the buildings (equivalent to cards in Agricola), game will become static and played out.  Caverna will never reach 10 status for me...but could drop to 8 after many repeated plays if it gets played out quickly.  Some of the buildings are clearly better than others...just like with the cards in Agricola.  The difference is that in Caverna, will it always be the same buildings bought?

Ok, after 4 plays, there is no denying this is an awesome game...bumping to 10.  Is it as good as Agricola...maybe it misses by a hair....but it isn't far behind..and deserves a 10 too.

After 11 plays in, dropping this back down to a 9.  The static furnishings presents a "race" to certain buildings.  While still very good and interesting, I prefer the cards of Agricola to develop a strategy around.

RATING: 6
Players manage a family of two dwarves, living in a cave in a mountain.  Players take actions to expand their living space, clear land, establish pastures for animals, sow fields with crops, mine ore and rubies out of the mountain, and so on.  The game is a worker placement game, placing dwarves to take actions, that expand your holdings and get an economy up and running.  The family can grow out to five dwarves, which must be fed regularly with food resources during the game.  Almost everything gathered is worth victory points at the end of the game (12 turns).

This is a reboot of the insanely popular Agricola from six or seven years ago.  A lot of the fiddly stuff from Agricola has been pruned out (the cooking, the cards, the wood/fences, the weird animal victory point ratios), and the game is better for it.  Expanding your holdings is faster now.  Dwarves can be armed with a weapon for the remainder of the game, allowing them to take the "expedition" action - a new feature - that rewards them with loot - basically free stuff that gets better and better as the weapons "level up".  Finally, there are mines and a new resource, rubies, than can be traded instantly for almost any other resource in the game, making powerful combo plays possible.

All in all, a glorious reimagining of Agricola, that now plays up to seven players.  A monster of a box, packed full of wood and cardboard.  Some concerns about down time as the Expeditions and associated loot selection can really bog the game down.  The game doesn't feel as tight as Agricola, with players constantly head-butting for the same contested actions.  Here, there appears to be more space to explore your strategy, and hence the game is slightly more forgiving.  Some will like that, others will miss the Agricola anguish.

After 8 plays, sold it on.  Agricola is a much better, tighter experience, and the cards set it above Caverna for me.

Love the way this game works, where you're constantly adapting to make the best, most efficient trades and decisions. Do I not be greedy and furnish that cavern now, or can I grab those 5 ore and hope that I can furnish next turn? You learn early on that most of the time, stubbornly sticking with one strategy won't net you the win, you have to be flexible and take into account how the game is flowing and to what others are doing. Being able to do so effectively is hard but highly satisfying.

Very nice production, with zillions of oversized chunky wooden bits.   Does it replace Agricola?   I'm leaning towards "NO".   I miss the front-loaded variability of Agricola.  While this game has some variability in the tiles, I think it could feel "samey" after a dozen plays.  Agricola is always full of surprises in the cards, and I love it for that.   Caverna can suffer from AP gridlock during multiple expeditions.  There are a lot of choices, all good, and that can slow the game down.  I don't think it is necessary to own both at this price point ($80), so if you don't like the cards or food constraints of Agricola, then maybe this is a better option.   But I think Agricola might be the better game for me in the long run.

Just to show where my loyalty lies first off, I do believe that Caverna completely replaces Agricola. The theme is more engaging, the cave/farm system is excellent and quest rewards are fun to get. Farming is boring, but farming beside a cave? - Sold.

That said, while I love the game, I don't feel the pay-off is entirely worth the time it takes to set-up and play in full. I enjoy the experience, the strategy, developing my cave and being as efficient as farmer as possible - but when I come out the other side and see how much time I spent doing it, I feel like I could have gotten in two better games in the time I played that one.

My first 'big game' purchase when i was stepping into the hobby. I wanted a meaty euro and this fits the bill. It is intensely satisfying to play. Accessible too. Shies away from a higher score because of the lack of tangible player interaction. This sits in my collection as THE worker-placement game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
What makes this more than just a fantastic worker-placement game is that you really do feel like you are creating a home that is very unique to anyone else.  At the end of a game I would walk around and see what the other players had created and its almost like each player had their own art project very unique and different from any other player or any other game before.  It’s a fun experience and an enjoyable time.  
Caverna has more get-out-of-jail-free mechanisms than its predecessor, Agricola; i.e. its much easier to feed your people and you feel a great burden lifted compared to playing that game.  Many Agricola veterans may likely find Caverna too light, but it is more appealing for general gamers and with less stress and I feel it is more fun.  
I guess the only thing that keeps this from hitting the table more often is the long set-up and take-down/pack-up time and the relative large amount of table space required to lay out the game.

Need to play this a few more times to be sure, but I like this about the same as agricola, just a little less.  It has some cool new ideas, but it falls short in one major area.  There are a lot of special rooms available in the game, but they never vary between games.  The cards, the heart of agricola's formula, are absent here, and with them goes a lot of the attraction.  Its predecessor is already perilously close to being a more-work-than-fun slog, and this may push caverna over the edge.  Time will tell.

[b][FirstImpression22ndNOV2013][/b] As someone who's not fond of Agricola, I very much prefer Caverna over Agricola. I just like the flow of Caverna better. 

The option to turn something into food is really a better thing for this game, since you now can focus at something else. In my first play, we had 3-4 rounds of continuous harvest/feeding and all players grunted, became so stressed about it. Good thing about this game is there's always something you can do to try and find food.

The exploration bit is also neat. I didn't went for exploration while the other 3 players (it was a 4 player session) were adventuring plenty of times. The loot that they got are extremely big deal while I had to find my own way to get things.

The components are amazing and the quality is outstanding.

An excellent game, we were soured on Uwe after Agricola, but Caverna brought us back around! Clean, simple gameplay, deep, important decisions, a great game for veterans and new people.  

Custom foamcore insert made by me, makes set up and take down far, far quicker.

RATING: 9
Caverna is so reminiscent of Agricola that it is impossible to measure it as a game without reference to its Mothership. In many respects Caverna irons out the flaws of Agricola, which were twofold: (1) your farm rarely really develops into a farm until right near the end when a rush for fencing or ploughing usually ends the game; and (2) the benefit of family members is too strong: not only do they give you more actions but they count as 3 points each too. In Caverna family members are only worth a point, and the food requirements and food benefits are re-ordered to encourage a much earlier farm (or cave) development. In many respects it is like the All Creatures Big & Small 2 player game where it is so much easier to have families of animals grazing away early in the the game. 
Ultimately these changes, as well as the interesting dwarf hunting and mining options, make it feel different to Agricola and so there really is room for both. Perhaps the greatest overall difference is that the lack of cards in Caverna make the game a lot more balanced, in that you can't win simply by having a powerful card-combo. Instead all buildings are available to all people. I think it will be hard for this game to displace Agricola. I am not sure why, as on paper it could be seen a better game due to the differences outlined. Maybe it is simply familiarity, in that you tend to love what you know more. Or maybe it is that the variability in the cards and the tough early feeding regime of Agricola are the things that distinguish it so positively.

If you liked Agricola you will like this one also.
From what I can see those who have some problems with Agricola (difficulty in managing choices and winning) tend to prefer this one, which is more forgiving and relaxed.

In Agricola you had your farmers, your little wooden house, which could be upgraded to bricks and then stone for extra points, and your fields, where most of the action happened.
Here you have more of the same, but with dwarves instead of farmers, plus a mountain to excavate your custom dwellers' rooms into, to unlock bonuses and powers.
And you can build weapons for your little dwarves and send them to adventures for some cool loot.

Full of stuff, tons of pieces around the table.

Totally worth it if you dig Uwe Rosemberg stuff.

In my opinion an upgrade to Agricola. With more possibilities and more reigned in.

The aspect of sending warriors out and gaining rewards is a great way to branch out. Although you can stick through traditional Agricola style ways to win as well.

Can be tedious to setup and replenish new resources, but who cares this is such a fun game. We find ourselves playing it again and again.

Bravo.

I've never liked Agricola and this game is arguably version 2.0. I think it makes a fun activity/toy (i don't mean this in a demeaning sense) in that building farms, caves etc is quite good fun. As for actually working out the best build order to get points and blocking other people, this is a bit tiresome for me.

I wouldn't play it with more than 3 because it drags too long.  2 is my favorite and 3 is okay.

Fourth Take:

The game grew stale for me because of the lack of variable set-up.  In solution to this I found this very good variant that I believe has much improved the base game.

Random Selection + Goals Variant (Variable Setup) 
https://boardgamegeek.com/article/19258251#19258251

With this variable set-up, the game is always fresh and a different strategy is mandatory every game.  Until the expansion arrives, I will be playing Caverna this way from now on.  With this variant, I give the game a 9.

Third Take:

This game is just straight up sexier than Agricola.  I hesitate to use the word "sexy" to describe a board game.  I never thought I would.  But when I think of these two games and compare them this is the word that comes to mind - 
"Sexy."  Caverna is just that.  When you look at the player boards and see the cleverly devised cave system next to the field system; When you see how each player can specialize and truly take a different path to victory than the others - developing their respective cave system with ruby mines, ore mines and furnishing tiles or rather, focusing on the fields outside and animal husbandry - you begin to see the superiority of this game.  It is SEXIER.  Agricola is good - I own it and I will still play it.  Honestly, I like the fences in Agricola better for some reason - even though they are more fiddly.  The cards in Agricola - the way I see it is that their are cards in Caverna as well.  The only difference is every player has access to them and they are in the middle.  The game is still different every time because a) to win the game and get a higher score you strategy needs to be tweaked against experienced players b) your strategy needs to be able to change on the go as other players disturb your original intentions c) you are prevented from doing the same thing every time by the 1) the need to score higher and 2) the player interaction.  So GET OUT OF HERE all of you who feel that this game is samey!  You just have not given it a chance because you are in the "Cult of the Old."  Move on to a better game and embrace the "sexy" of Caverna!

Second Take:

The game is not lighter than Agricola.  It just has a different approach.  I see it as the idea that one graduates from Agricola to Caverna.  Unless you have mastered the occupations and improvements of Agricola, you won't fully appreciate Caverna.  I say this because Caverna is like Agricola in a sense.. except Agricola gives you 14 cards while Caverna lays all the cards out on the table.  Your strategies have to constantly change in Caverna due to the pool of tiles instead of private cards.  To get a higher score in Caverna your strategies need to constantly be tweaked and changed as well.  Don't believe those who say that this game doesn't have replay-ability.  I am hoping for an expansion that will include a variable set-up though.

First Take:

I love caverna.. it is a great game.  The only drawback is the lack of variable set-up.  The game doesn't change and thus the replayability goes down.  Although the game provides plenty of different strategies that will keep one modifying for years if wanted.  However, Agricola seems to have the upper hand in this category because of the cards.  This game - Caverna - is lighter and less deep than Agricola in this regard.  If your looking for an easier game than Agricola in this regard, than pick up Caverna.  I am going to keep this game for now.. but I am thinking about trading it for Agricola with the Farmers of the Moor.  If you are interested please let me know.

RATING: 6
It's a slightly denser and freer game of Agricola, but at the end of the day, it's still Agricola.  From the highly-competitive and efficiency-driven worker placement to the room improvements and people-feeding, it's largely the same game.  Some better points are the exploration and the more forgiving final scoring, but the game still penalizes you for not doing certain things.  It's not a game I like, but not a bad one overall.

RATING: 7
A good successor to Agricola, which to me always felt a bit too stressful. In Agricola you must do a bit of everything, in Caverna there are so many options to choose from but not many of them punish you for ignoring them. There are a ton of specialized rooms to pick from to create a niche strategy each game, but it can be a bit overwhelming. The actual adventuring part is essentially a shopping list of items to pick from, creating a sort of generalized action that gets more rewarding with time. After half a dozen plays I feel a bit bored by this game - I either need to focus extra hard on which rooms to specialize in, or spend the game sort of just doing whatever actions feel appropriate for the round. Still a good game, but not one I want to pick off the shelf and play very often. Someone explain why this wasn't made for 4 players rather than up to 7? Madness.

90-120m, best with 2-4 players. 5+ plays.

Played 4 times now and still really enjoy this, however, I'm now starting to get what the Agricola apologists are saying about the static setup. I find myself always falling into the same rut... not really the games fault per se, but unless I really study the buildings and prep, I can see myself trying the same strategy game after game (it's a bit overwhelming to do this on the fly and stay competitive). It's possible this can drop a little but not much.

RATING: 7
After playing Ora et Labora and hearing about Caverna I kept wondering if Le Havre : Ora et Labora :: Agricola : Caverna.  For me, it's true.  Caverna would completely replace Agricola in my collection if I owned it.  The biggest thing for me is that there is just a lot of good options to take, even if you get blocked.  The expedition is perhaps the most interesting addition to the game.  Getting different resources from a single action space is not that interesting, but how you arm your dwarves, how they level and the fact that lower-level dwarves have to be placed before higher level ones, is really interesting.  It's also great that it's a lot easier to feed your family and the scoring differences mean you don't have to diversify if you don't want to.  

It's not all sunshine and lollipops though... I still don't like that people can have uneven number of workers.  They've partially addressed this in that it's easier to build rooms for extra people and there are more action spaces that will grow your family.  I like that there is a lot of buildings available, but I don't like how they're all available right from the get-go... it reminds me that I dislike a lot of front-loaded decisions like a set of 10 cards in dominion.  Even worse is the fact that there is no player-aid for people sitting further away from the buildings.  After the lovely resource wheel of OeL, it's tiresome to go back to filling all of the action spaces each round.  Speaking of resources, I find it weird that there are so many bloody components, but we almost ran out of stone and wood multiple times throughout the game and we only played a 4-player game.  Granted, we didn't use the multipliers but I think you would definitely need to when playing with more than 4.  This game is a beast to set up.  So, while I think Caverna is a solid title and an amzing improvement over Agricola, I think there will always be other Uwe games I prefer.

I only played Agricola once so I can't really compare the two. What I can say is that I REALLY enjoy this game. The components are amazing. You can accomplish a lot during the game so I'm left feeling satisfied at how much I developed my farm and cave, even if I don't pull off the win. It seems like there is always a good move to take, even if the ideal move was taken by another player before you. Also, I think there are a lot of strategies to victory. The rule book is a bit lengthy, though. And it can take a while to set up the game and put it away because of how many unique pieces there are. To solve this last problem, I found some plans on BGG to make my own trays out of foam board, which work wonders! Another aspect that is a bit overwhelming is the number of furnishings available. I think this is a game that I will enjoy more and more as I become more familiar with the furnishings and don't have to spend so much time reading them over. The number of furnishings was probably the most difficult aspect of introducing the game to new players. I encouraged people to ignore them during the intro to the game and look over them when it wasn't their turn, which seemed to help. As with any game with a lot of choices, AP-prone people can freeze when trying to decide what to do.

Everybody tells me this is so much better than Agricola.  I've only played it one time and I'm still not sure if they're correct of if it's just the new hotness and they're suffering from fan-boy syndrome.  The addition of leveling up your workers and going on expeditions is a nice touch.  It's definitely very good.  I'm just not sure if it's fundamentally different from Agricola.

A slightly better version of Agricola. It is terribly long, and for some reason it plays 7. Anything over 4 players just drags on. All together decent, but definitely nothing special. Overall with the long play time and lackluster interaction. I'm never in a hurry to play this.

Caverna is not as good of a game as Agricola, but it is more fun. Building out your cave with unique rooms (and abilities), and weaponizing your dwarves to reap the spoils of adventure are great additions to the Agricola mold. However, the tense and unforgiving scarcity of Agricola is completely lost, and the absence of the occupations/improvements is noticeable. Caverna is a more friendly, more 'fantastic' version of Agricola, but I prefer the ruthlessness of the simple farm.

My current favorite. Tons of strategies. I am confident I can teach this to almost anyone. The box is intimidating when first opened, but the rules are relatively simple.

Update 4/20: Caverna took a wine cooler to the face not all that long ago. Was pretty upset, thought that most of the game would be damaged beyond... well, it didn't. Testimony to the quality of the pieces. Only a couple tiles even look damaged at all, and they just look slightly discolored on the edge. Yeah, it's a 90 dollar game, but I didn't have to replace it at least once. Sometimes you do, in fact, get what you pay for.

This is definitely one of my favorite games ever played. It has an incredible sense of progression and is rewarding to complete.  It's not overly punitive like its predecessor Agricola, it always offers interesting choices, has a low barrier of entry for newcomers, has a ludicrous amount of replayability due to the fact that there are a ton of paths to victory.  The game is beautiful, and essentially requires a Plano box.  I would love to see an expansion that makes the nighttime side of the board in some way different.

RATING: 7
This game is the solution to a problem I don’t have. The oft maligned cards of Agricola are removed here and a tableau of rooms are on offer for all players. Mostly, there’s just one copy of each though. The rooms confer in-game benefits or endgame VP bonuses and serve like the cards of ‘Gric but without the griping of who got dealt what.

Another problem that doesn’t need solving is addressed via the expedition mechanism whereby you can equip your workers to go hunting for everything and anything. You can get pretty much whatever you want by spending actions to train up your dwarves then send them out to collect whatever you want from a list of allowed items. 

The whole affair is fine and I’ll play on occasion, but it lacks the oomph of Agricola for me. Giving players a very tight worker placement space along with 14 cards and asking them to figure out what to do excites me much more than getting my dwarves up to a level where they can go shopping for whatever they need. I get that there’s tension in having players race to get certain rooms first – in fact, that IS the tension here – but I prefer deciding which cards to play and which not to.

it was fun, but felt too much like Agricola without any of the tension.  By halfway through the game, no one was competing for the same set of spaces because everyone had a different specialty they were working towards.  So as a point salad game it was nice (but I enjoy a lot of those games which made this feel like just another basic euro game), I was really hoping for something with a bit more tight competition for actions and scoring.

Obviously based on and similar to Agricola, comparisons are inevitable.  On its own, Caverna is a decent game, with competition and that ever present sense of not being able to accomplish all one wants or needs to do in the limited time frame.

When compared to Agricola, Caverna seems a little more open and less constrained, and therefore lacks some of the tension of its older sib.  I also feel mixed about the open nature of the buildings.  It is nice having these objectives open to competition, but the "secret objective" flavor of the minor improvements and occupations in Agricola seem more enjoyable.

Ugh. This one is too much like Agricola. Comparisons to that one are not avoidable. I liked this much better than the other, but not enough to get me to play it again. The ability to pay food to copy someone else's action is very nice, at least until all the copy spaces are gone. It's also very nice that there are fewer things to have to concentrate on so that by the end of the game you feel like you've actually accomplished something, instead of missing many things.

Rating after 2 plays: A great game with a lot of strategy options. For me, it's still a little too much, especially with all the green building (special powers) and a bit too many special rules.  But you can easily play without buying the green buildings, and still do quite ok. And I think I will be comfortable with them after repeated plays. All the special rules make fortunately quite good sense thematically. A little long set-up, but I think I will keep it in my collection for now.

There are aspects of this game that are strictly better than Agricola, but then there are aspects of Agricola that I prefer over this game.  That said, it plays differently enough from Agricola that I wouldn't say one replaces the other and at this point I still think I prefer Agricola a bit.  I will have to play Caverna a good deal more before I make up my mind on which one I feel is better.

So far I like this more than the original game.  There's almost always something I can do even with my last worker.  I don't feel like I've lost the game before I even started like I sometimes feel with the card draft in Agricola.

I've heard people say that Caverna "fixed" the struggle for food in Agricola. I think it ruined a great thing.

I also think that Caverna is too formless in general. It adds more of everything and then adds resources that can be used as anything (rubies and weapons). It just has too many degrees of freedom for any of your decisions to be meaningful.

I would never play this over Agricola.

This is less punishing than agricola as resources are more plentiful and each action space allows you to do up to two different things. I disliked this less than I thought I would. In fact I think I want to play again!

My experience with this game is somewhat soured by the fact our rules explainer, with three turns to go, dropped into conversation that you lose points for not filling your cave/farm and for not having all the animals, you know just like in agricola. Because everyone who plays games is familiar with agricola right? ... Well actually NO. Three of the five players at the table were not, and so this came as a bit of a shock and a mad scramble to fill said cave/farm to minimise the damage at the end of the game

The expeditions feels a bit like a win more mechanic as it allows you to break some of the fundamental rules such as both clearing a field, ploughing it, acquiring the seed and planting it in a single action whereas it would be two or three actions with out the expedition... expeditions are so powerful I am not convinced we were playing them correctly at all.

I played it once, but I loved it much more than Agricola. Although not a fan of worker placement games (it leads to analysis paralysis in my brain), this game feels well balanced. Almost the entire game you have the feeling there are several roads to victory, that blocking your opponent is not really possible, that will earn loads of resources in your next move (maybe not the resources you need though :-)). Conclusion: i don't like worker placement games, but of all wp games ever played, this was by far the best.

This is a beast of a game with tons of components, and contains almost everything you could ever want out of a strategy board game - farming, adventuring, city-building, resource-management, etc. I enjoy that your strategy can adapt as you play, based on what resources have become available to you. You can also easily play with just two-players or even solo. I recommend watching someone playthrough on Youtube and then play on your own while referencing the rule book. The rules make the game seem more complex than it really is. Was expecting a longer game - my only complaint thus far.

I like this game because it is based on Agricola, which is my favorite game of all time. Lots of routes to generating points, lots of fun things to do (farm, breed, mine, quest!), wonderful art. I prefer the higher stress and greater variety of Agricola, but Caverna is very good. I'm glad a friend owns a copy.

MAY 2014: After playing a second time, I kept my rating at a 9, but now - a few days later - I'm upping it to a 10. I held it at 9 because I like Agricola better than Caverna, but that doesn't mean Caverna doesn't deserve a 10. After 20-30 plays, Caverna could drop to a 9 again (lack of variability with the buildings), but right now all the buildings are new to me and I'm having a blast.

May 24, 2014: It only took 4 plays for this game to feel both "same-y" and loose (lacking competitive tension). I thought this game would have at least 20 plays in it, but after 4 plays, I'm downgrading my rating from a 10 to an 8. I expect this will be an 8 for a while though. Not a very good two player game.

My initial impression of Caverna was that it was more fun than Agricola. On my fourth playing of Caverna, the fun is largely gone. Quests are still fun, and I like the visual presentation, but Agricola is a better and more variable strategy game.

Caverna looks fantastic, plays smoothly, and offers tons of options. These tons of options wowed me at first, but on my 4th playing, just feel loose. Agricola is excruciating at times, has a fairly boring "food engine" start-up, but then hums as the Occupation and Minor Improvement cards allow TONS of replayability.

June 2014: Another play, another 8 rating. I approached this game determined to appreciate the sandbox feel that it provides (something that Agricola does not do), and even with this new approach, it's not that interesting to me as a sandbox game. I want to give this game another 3 plays with RADICALLY different sandbox approaches just to see what happens when you stretch some of the boundaries.

AUG 2014: Played again, trying as much as possible to forget my Agricola training, and just play it sandbox style. Went mine strategy, Ore Storage for 15 VPs, rubies bought me necessities, and I won the game. And yet this still is only an 8 for me. Every game feels the same. It's a fun game, and I'll play it, but Agricola is still more fun for the starting hand of cards. No matter how I approach/play Caverna, I can't get more enjoyment out of it than an 8 rating.

7th play: 7. 4p - Milking Stool/yellow furnish. Starting to fade for me. The components are awesome, but every playing feels sort of the same to me now. If Agricola didn't exist, I'd have this at an 8 or 9, but Agricola does exist, and I'd rather play that. 08/14

Pros
-Same as Agricola but somewhat streamlined. Made easier to feed and get points appeal to many.
-New options such as exploring are available and add new winning strategies
-Geometry of farm/cave becomes more important
-Dual housing rules for most animals adds to flexibility
-Lots of game boards allows game to scale fairly well up to 7 players (but you may not want to do that due to downtime)
-Lots of meeple/chit in box (but somewhat high price)
-Can be played solo with very few rule changes (but the order buildings come up in are predetermined, so replayability is somewhat limited unless you choose to change that and just randomize them - not sure on balance).

Cons
-Took away cards from Agricola
-All buildings are available right away, takes away from inherent variability of game
-Feeding (some) and growth phases are predetermined
-Better than a lot of euro games, but still indirect competition

Note
-Rated very slightly higher than Agricola primarily due to own preference and experiences. I prefer the greater variety one can take to win, and I feel there is a greater quantity of options on any given turn.

It really is a lot like Agricola.

However:
* The scoring is much simpler and more streamlined
* The special buildings are open and available to be purchased by anyone
* The game isn't as constricting - there are alternative spots for actions, you can convert resources to food automatically, rubies are practically a wild resource, there are "mimic" spaces, and actions are very powerful (eg family growth is available from the start, plough-and-sow is available in the first round).
* Tile placements are much more free, but the spatial element is much more important.

I actually like the game better than Agricola because it's easier to comprehend.

[3 plays]I have my doubts about the longevity of this game compared to Agricola considering everything is laid out the same way from the beginning, but I'm thoroughly enjoying my first games.  Part of the allure of Agricola is building your farm, and in Caverna you basically build two!  There are also more varied strategies and I'm pulled in more 'positive' directions rather than only being able to choose one of the two choices I need to achieve something.

Caverna is even more similar to Agricola than I had expected, and I'm not sure which I like better yet. Having a central bank of room tiles instead of individual sets of cards changes the dynamic and makes it slightly more interactive. I don't know that I'm a huge fan of the warrior expedition rewards as it can slow the game down and makes it (too?) easy to get any resource a person needs. But it is a little more streamlined.

Worst game I have ever played, too many wild card options, just multi player solitude, especially felt below 4 players, over 5 a boring downtime, I'm not sure what it is.

Get a score, try next time to bump it by 1-2 points by trying something slightly different. You can pretty much play the same game over and over. 

That 1 raving review for this thing is the only reason I can find figure out why it is rated so high as people align themselves to that reviewer. 

Get pass the over chrome there is nothing here. This is just the same old crap seen in a series of games from this designer, bet we will see a watered down version, some small mechanism pulled, sold as a 2 player game, with a price tag of $60.00 if history repeats itself. 

I question just how often it gets to the table and that it supports anything but 4 player games.

Nem rossz játék, sokkal érdekfeszítőbb, mint az agricola. Sokan mondják, hogy a fix épületek miatt unható, de ehhez nagyon sokat kéne játszani. Elsőre esélyünk se volt felfogni a 48 épület által nyújtott lehetőségeket, nemhogy a kombókat.
Izgalmas a törp fejlesztés, a pontozás is talán jobb lett, viszont az etetés továbbra is kritikus (pedig azt hallottam kevésbé az), nomeg a plusz ember szerzése is elkerülhetetlen szerintem, bár a tápolás esetleg opciót adhat más fejlődési útra, pláne, hogy már nem érnek olyan sok pontot az emberek a végén.
Egy baj volt csak vele, hogy az én ízlésemnek azért hosszú.

6/23/2015-The reason I like this game is because of the action selection you can take wood to build a dwelling,a cavern,a fence or even trade it.
Another reason is the components are almost all  wood,and you get the following wooden pieces: sheep dogs cows donkeys boars wood stone wheat pumpkins-ect...   
now the down side to this is that there are two ways of playing 1(A person like me that is good at that kind of game) and 2(you play and you try to build a farm and don't realize that you are building a engine)so if you have one player who plays 1 and the other plays 2.1 will double 2's points 90% of the time.That is the down side to the game. dc


My score is 8.9.dc

I’m not sure I like this over Agricola. More options is not necessarily a better experience. I like the tense decisions in Agricola based on scarcity of resources, which doesn’t seem to be the case here, as there are more ways to solve your problems. Still a good game.

I do like the distinction between the cave and the outside and how players can chose do developers either or a combination of both.

RATING: 7
Caverna is a solid game - its close resemblance to its older brother Agricola already sees to that. When explaining the rules to someone who already knows Agricola I would guess that the time needed is reduced by about 50%.

So, what's different? I'd say there are two major changes. There are, of course, several others in the fine print as well, but these two stand out as game-defining, and they are the reason that Caverna is not just Agricola 2 with minor tweaks although it is still obviously in the same category of games.

The first change is primarily mechanical. The deck of cards with individual player abilities has been replaced by a pool of buildings akin to the major improvements in Agricola. This certainly removes some of the volatility from the cards which is nice while the obvious drawback is reduced variability from game to game. Whether that is a problem for replayability in the long term remains to be seen. It also means that there is a bit more frontloading happening when you're new to the game and need to get a grasp on all of the available buildings. All in all, I'm not yet sure whether this change results in a net positive or a net negative.

The other major change is mostly one of how the game feels. It is, overall, at lot less tight than Agricola. There are several changes that contribute to this, starting from more ways to choose certain actions, including easier procurement of food, and ending in a streamlined scoring system that allows quite a bit more specialization than Agricola did. I happen to like the additional pressure so this is not for the better.

Even though there are a few nice tweaks in Caverna I still prefer its older sibling. Obviously, that does not at all mean that Caverna is a bad game and, depending on where you stand regarding turn angst, it might even be the better one.

I have played my first solo game (first time of caverna at all). I have reached 90 points, it was a cool experience, I am looking forward for my next match...

Question: Is it allowed to move a new born animal for example from the field into the cave (donkey), if the field is full?
If I get an animal by an action card, then I can transform it to food right? Only if it is born this round this is not allowded right?
For example if I get 5 sheep, but I have only 4 spaces on the farm left, so I can transfer one to food right?

The Dwarfs in this game are agriculturalists, builders, warriors and parents.
A game to have a lot of fun weighing your options, optimizing your food production, collection resources on adventures, digging for rubis and managing the offspring.
It's a longer game for a bit more experienced players wothout beeing too complicated.
I love that nearly anything can get you points and the many viable strategies in this game.
If you're searching for a thematic building and resource managing game with a lot of depth, don't look further.

I was a little concerned that I was not going to enjoy this as much as Agricola. It read like it was an Agricola reimplementation (which it is) but far more bloated with a bunch of silly little rules plaguing the system. To my surprise, it flows just as well as Agricola, which is an amazing feat of design considering how much more to look at on the table in Caverna. Overall, I might even like this one slightly better than Agric as it doesn't rely on the random Occupation/Improvement cards going out.  (Though I'm always up for the challenge of luck in Agric.) Everyone has a chance to buy the special tiles that are available in the game. It also looks very impressive. There is not as much pressure to scrounge for food every round, which sometimes feels like the primary aim of my turns in Agricola if my engine isn't running efficiently. As such, you have room to stretch and try things out and make things work. Not much I can say here in the realm of badness. I wish so much that this was not made for 7 players. It must have bumped up the price of this game by about $20 and it is completely unnecessary for a base game.  But overall the quality of the game is excellent.

Okazuje się, że Uwe nie taki zły, jak go malują :) Kawerna bardzo pozytywnie mnie zaskoczyła. Tematyka jest o wiele ciekawsza, możliwości bardzo wiele, ale presja wykarmienia rodziny nie ogranicza planów. Można kombinować i przeliczać, ale tak naprawdę zawsze coś ciekawego da się zrobić, w ten czy inny sposób - nie ma problemu z punktami, więc gra jest bardziej relaksująca. Zdecydowanie przemawia do mnie zlikwidowanie kart pomocników, a zamiast tego wprowadzenie wypraw i większej ilości zwierząt hodowlanych. Grafiki są przyjemne dla oka i kolorowe, z kart nie straszy już średni projekt postaci znany z Agricoli. Jak dla mnie, gra ta usprawnia wszystko to, co najbardziej denerwowało mnie w Agricoli. Warto spróbować. Na pewno chętnie zagram więcej razy,testując inne rozwiązania.

I played a couple of solo games. It's pretty fun but I haven't played it enough to determine if it lives up to all the hype or not. You basically need to ramp up your your reproduction of animals, food, and dwarf population to mine the underground living spaces where the dwarf family lives. When you get enough donkey's in there (to help you min rubies), you can kick ASS so to speak. The game has an unbelievable amount of cool things you can build. Them combinations are staggering and really cool.

What I'm looking forward to are tons of options, decisions and building combos. Another thing that appeals to me is the sense of building and owning something. My farm will be different than your farm.
What I'm worried about is that the game feel to easy, because, as I have heard, there are so many options that blocking is almost impossible and players can't do bad in this game.
-----------------------------------
As I thought, Caverna fixes everything I didn't like about Agricola. 
-----------------------------------
I like  a lot of things about Caverna, but the quest mechanic is problematic. It takes too much time and spoils the flow of the game. If it wasn't for this, I'd say this game is pretty great.

Love it. I love seeing my dwarf home grow and unlike Agricola I don't feel stressed and have multiple ways to survive round to round. Not a tight game but sometimes I don't want to think 15 rounds ahead and have my plans screw up because of a miscalculation.

For my gaming group this is definitely one of our go to games. Love the replayability and constantly learning new strategies. Although, it is a toss up between Agricola and Caverna for my favorite worker placement game. The strategy in this game is very good though and the only luck involved is who goes first and last. We really dont like games of chance or into games of direct conflict. This makes Caverna a 10 in my books! Played 20 plus times.

First of all — I don't like Agricola; never have. To me, Agricola just seems like "FarmVille - The Board Game" ...

Now, I know a lot of people will claim that Caverna is simply Agricola 2.0, and that's fine. Caverna is a good game. Agricola is not. Caverna is the game Agricola wants to be. I like the dwarf theme better, and I like that the game is less restrictive.

Time and time again I hear Agricola haters rave over how good of a game Caverna is. This game has finally won me over, and proudly so. Honorable mention goes to Sam Healy.

Farming and mining with dwarves...a slightly kinder version of Agricola without the cards...but alot of unique buildings that take their place.

Excellent mid weight euro - the usual gather resources and convert to VP engine building but done in a streamlined and very easy to understand way - my 84 year old mum-in-law picked up the game in easy time and had a great time playing. Lots of available actions and an open table of upgrades accessible to all makes the game quick and very fun.

Theme is minimal - this is a VP efficiency game after all.

The components are great!

Currently (Summer 2015) the game we play most frequently. It's nice to have a wide range of available strategies, although arguably the lack of asymmetry (that is, removing Agricola's random assignment of minor improvement and occupation cards) could reduce it's long-term appeal, as well as removing a strong incentive for players to try new strategies.

RATING: 5
Received from my Mum for my birthday 2014.

Rating based on one play. Played my first game of Caverna yesterday at London on Board. Lost 77-83. It made our brains hurt. Yes, it feels like turbo-injected Gric, but I fear that's only half because it's different and half because it's just more complicated. Not freewheeling so much as trackless. I would balk at teaching this game to anyone who wasn't already familiar with Agricola.

Here's why I prefer [thing=31260][/thing], in approximate order of importance:

1. Less intimidating for new players. OK, Agricola can still be pretty intimidating, but Caverna starts with 48 buildings face-up (or I think it's 25 in beginner mode) and you feel just clueless about what they all do and how they might interact. In Agricola, you're equally clueless about the cards, but there are a lot fewer of them - and fewer still if you play the family game.

2. I can hook in gamer-sceptics better with "we're farmers trying to survive..." than "we're dwarves..."

3. The cards you get at the start of Agricola are different every time, which has kept the replayability unnaturally high for me. I haven't played Caverna enough yet to get bored of the buildings, but they're the same every time so, well, I might...

4. Agricola is more portable.

Looking at those reasons I realise my opinion is largely shaped by the way I usually play games: often introducing new players and trying to hook them in, rather than intensely exploring games with expert players. People seem to like Caverna because there's less struggle to feed your family, so you can focus on different strategies - but for me the struggle for food in Agricola drives the game. Also, you get more bling in Caverna, but I think it's *too much* of a good thing. Agricola with animeeples is plenty pretty enough.

I wanted to give it more chances, but every time I had a chance to bring it to the table the thought of ALL THOSE BUILDINGS put me off. Sold in December 2014.

This was a purchase based on how much I like Agricola and Le Havre, and people saying that it improves on many of the things that make Agricola a hard game to get to the table sometimes.

Now that I've played this a few times, I think I have a solid opinion on it.  I don't think it replaces Agricola really, as they are two different games.  The puzzle of getting your cards in hand in Agricola and figuring out your path isn't really present here.  That's not good or bad, it's just soooooo different I think.  I totally get the comparisons, but that's a pretty major part of Agricola, so despite so many similarities, they feel like different games to me.

My wife likes this a lot more, probably because of the lack of stress induced by feeding being so much easier in this one.

I'm pretty much in on anything from Uwe, and this is not different.

The threat of starvation in Agricola is a source of stress for us, and the game ends right when we finally get the puzzle solved so we never really get to see our engine running smoothly, which robs us of a little satisfaction.  I'd like to try Caverna before buying to see if the lack of card variety is a dealbreaker despite the removal of the starvation threat.  Rahdo thinks Glass Road is better than this, and it plays faster, so we're going to give that a shot first.

UPDATE AFTER FIRST PLAY: OMG, so much more relaxing and enjoyable than Agricola.  It's so much more streamlined and straightforward.  I feel like I could actually teach this to people and that they'd enjoy playing.  This game is just plain fun.  Thank you Uwe Rosenberg.

UPDATE AFTER 2nd PLAY: I successfully taught this to 6 new gamers, ages from 11 to 45.  Everybody had fun.  This would not have happened with Agricola (on their first play).

UPDATE AFTER 5th PLAY: I can see the validity of the criticisms regarding the sameness of every game.  I'm not to the point where it bugs me yet, but I can already appreciate what Agricola did with the cards and variability between games more as time goes on.

Great game. When compared to Agricola seems a little different, yet quite similar. Not so tense as Agricola, however this game seems to be open to more strategy options than in Agricola, because of easier feeding, resource gathering etc. Not so tense as Agricola, but multiple paths to victory available (like in Le Havre). This game is probably at the same level (more or less) as Agricola and Le Havre. These three games (Agricola, Le Havre and Caverna: The Cave Farmers) are some of the greatest board games ever.
This game doesn't replace Agricola. This is a different game. Both of them are brilliant games, but still different. I'll keep all three of these great games - Caverna: The Cave Farmers, Agricola and Le Havre.

Looking back on 2013, I've breathed in more than my share of new-game smells. 
However, nothing compares to Caverna. 
Based on a single solo game, I'm ready to call it: this is my Game of the Year. 
I've always considered myself Ameritrash to the bone, but this is the third Uwe game that's rocked me. (F the Glass Road haters).

Uwe Rosenberg at his best it would seem, unfortunately.

I'm not sure what this is. There is just no enjoyable game here, just a lot of pretty parts.

They claim Euros can feel like cube pushers. What do you call the collection of games Uwe Rosenberg cranks out that are just mindless resource collecting then converting them into something else, just slapping on another theme?

Another mindless, amazingly directionless, slow, slow point race, that fanboys like to call a sandbox. More like playing in a cat litter box.

Caverna has multiple paths to victory without ever feeling to restricted or too punished by requirement to feed family (those who have played Agricola will know what I mean.)Its great to look at boards at the end of the game and see what you have created. Only downside is the cost/lots of components/boards that will only ever stay in the box - who in their right mind wants to play this with 7 players!

Super-long setup and take-down, and I found the buildings a tad overwhelming, but liked the forgiveness in the game re food.
Update 28.1.17 - played a second time, and could see the game for its own character rather than in the shadow of Agricola. Really enjoyed my time with it, saw that there is opportunity to explore different strategies without the tight stress of creating a food engine. Highly enjoyable.

I normally have avoided Euro style games because i tend to prefer games with a heavy theme and lots of player interaction, however, I really enjoy Caverna. It has yet to hit my game groups table but in the first night I owned it, I spent over 4 hours playing the solo game. Caverna is simple to play but has an immense amount of depth, the more layers you peel away, the more are revealed which is something I can really appreciate in a game. And then there is the options!! There are literally hundreds of builds to try and they are only limited by your imagination and the game pieces. Awesome stuff

I dislike Agricola, but there's something needly about it, something that gets under my skin and makes me want to understand WHY I dislike it, maybe even hope to enjoy playing it someday. Caverna removes most of the negatives from Agricola, but it's also missing the itch factor that would tempt me to give it a second chance. So that's that.

Seems to 'fix' a lot of the complaints and 'problems' people had with Agricola. For me it will never compare though, because by taking away the cards and adding the tiles that are the same in every game, although it makes it more balanced and means there is no problem of getting a really good or really bad hand, it also takes away the huge element of variability and replayability. A solid game nonetheless, but I'll stick with Agricola most of the time.

Classic heavy worker placement euro. Lots (and lots and lots) of interesting strategies to take here.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
A total bloated game that I'm not sure is a game. It's a first come, first get tile pick. Get the same players in the same seats,  the game can play out almost the same. 

 It gets boring really quick with very few plays. As for the player count, 1 player seems mindless, 2 players games has a strong "can be almost played exactly the sam". At best it's a 4 player game with hope that someone deviate from their last play. 5-7 players ridiculous long too much down time. 

This seems to be a game that you play just to make minor changes to your last play to see if you can beat your old score by 1-2 points. I have never seen such an overwhelming hyped game all based I guess because of an overstuffed box. It gives sandbox games a bad name. 

I wonder how many people own this and like Monopoly it just sits in the closet. 

If you dislike Euros, hate them, you will love this thing as this is no game.

RATING: 6.5
Might be expensive, but it's the opposite of Gates of Loyang where the box (same size) is almost empty. This one is filled to the brim with stuff!

Mechanics are great. The lack of cards that we have in Agricola does not lessen the fun of the game... beside, this ain't supposed to be Agricola, it's supposed to be something else, so putting no cards was one of the big things that sets the two games apart.

What is great is that if someone buys this game, he could still buy Agricola, they are not the same game even though there are many similarities, they are different enough to be both in your possession.

The only problems about Caverna is that it is a lot to assimilate, especially to new players to the genre, and that each game is pretty much the same once you know the possible strategies that you can use to maximize your points, unlike Agricola which is quite different.

The one big bad side of Caverna, it is that you mostly do the same thing each game unlike agricola. It is also a big headache for many people.

After a couple of plays, I do agree that this "fixes" much of what is wrong with Agricola. But it also introduces a few more systems in what was already a systems-heavy game.

It's a great sequel to Agricola. It lacks the same tension, and the AP can get bad because the choices escalate with the rubies and expeditions, but it is more forgiving and is better about allowing multiple victory paths.

Wykastrowana Agricola. Zdecydowanie za łatwa, wszystko idzie zbyt lekko, nie ma już tego przyjemnego napięcia i stresu jak w pierwowzorze.
Jest to dobra i ładnie wykonana gra, żeby nie było. Ale porównując do Agricoli (a inaczej się nie da) wypada blado i infantylnie. A już kompletnie nie wiem, po co tryb aż do siedmiu osób!

Although a few things are streamlined from it's predecessor there is one thing Caverna lacks that made Agricola great: tension.  The stress of trying to make due with insufficient resources and not quite enough turns was the highlight of Agricola.  Caverna borrows the mechanics but is far too forgiving.  Losing points because you were blocked by an opponent or fell short of a goal is ok I guess but pales in comparison to the impending starvation of your family as Winter approaches.

This is one of the favorite at him. My kids, espicially my 7th years old love it. Very similar to Agricola but without the cards (minor/major improvements and occupations) which are replaced with Cavern rooms that you built inside your cave to develop your strategy. Not as stressfull to feed your worker since you can convert some ressources directly to food without requiring oven and the such like in Agricola.

I find Caverna a very appealing game. The mechanics are awesome and the components are remarkably crafted. The variety of strategies is much appreciated. It is pure delight to have some friends home and play this game. Beginners even get the grasp quickly. I definitely recommend it.

On the downside, you need a relatively big table to play this game because of all the different components (resource tokens, tiles, player boards, etc.)in this game.

[ES] En esencia, Caverna es agrícola 2.0. Como su hermano mayor, Caverna es un juego de colocación de trabajadores y gestión de recurso. La mayor diferencia es que Caverna ha transformado las adquisiciones y oficios en habitaciones disponibles para todos los jugadores. Es una excelente solucionando para lo que para mi es uno de los  fallos mas grande de Agrícola: lo cuesta arriba que puede ser una partida si te tocan malas cartas. Caverna no enfatiza tanto el alimentar a la familia, dando así mas margen para las demás acciones.

[EN] In essence, Caverna is Agricola 2.0. Like its older brother, Caverna is a worker placement and resource management game. The biggest difference between the two are the rooms, caverna's version of improvements and occupations. Unlike Agricola, In caverna, all the rooms are available to all players, solving one of caverna's biggest flaws: Fighting an uphill battle only based on luck of the draw. Caverna also eased on the feeding your family pressure, allowing players to explore other actions and strategies.

I'm not sure I see a reason to prefer this to Agricola. It's smoother in a lot of ways, to be sure, but between the slew of special buildings available at the outset (Caverna) and the cards (Agricola) I think I prefer the cards. They throttle information and choice, so as to prevent overload, and they also give a reason to pursue different approaches each game. Caverna already feels too samey. The flexibility afforded by rubies and expeditions are nice, but that might make them too dominant.
It's a great game, to be sure--but not as great as its forebear.

Oooooh k... I don't like Agricola much. I like Le Havre more and here comes Caverna.

To make it short, this feels much better than Agricola, even though it's very similar and has the same "do everything or lose points" problem.

I think you need some plays to get the game rolling, as there are so many buildings available.

So what keeps me away from buying it? Like "Russian Railroads", this game lacks interaction to a point where it becomes boring. It could be way better if you could interact with the other players.

Oh well, you can't have everything. Still a good game, but not worthy my hard to get shelf place.

More wide open than Agricola - this game has an impressively wide array of viable paths you can take to victory.  I really like the new additions to the game(rubies and expeditions), and the animal husbandry aspect has never been implemented better than it is in this game.  Still, Caverna does not quite reach the heights of its predecessor, Agricola.   I still prefer the occupation/minor improvement cards in Agricola.  The cards are what keeps Agricola fresh, fun, and deep.  Caverna's replayability is limited by a comparatively stale setup.

Lack of randomized setup means I think Agricola is a better game still but Caverna is still a quality game with a ton of things going on. The lower pressure due to food being easier to deal with should make it more appealing to wider audiences.

RATING: 6
I'm not a big fan of Uwe Rosenberg's games (like Agricola and Le Havre).  There are too many options each turn, and you need to gather resources to do them, so you end up working on these long chains of actions which will take more than a turn... and then someone takes the action that you wanted, thus blocking it, so you have to recalculate a different path of actions (and even come up with a new strategy).  This can easily trigger Analysis Paralysis, and the game can just drag.

Caverna is a lot like Agricola, with family members as workers, various categories of resources, and ways to score points, but it seems a little less congested.  It's nice that everybody has access to build any of the buildings, rather than having random cards dealt out at the beginning.  But with all of those buildings, it can be overwhelming if you don't know what they all do (or if you forget to build one when it would really be helpful).

You don't have to have all 5 (or 6!) family members to win.  But beyond that, there's no magic theme -- you have to grind out a strategy, turn-by-turn, action-by-action, since your best-laid plans can be thwarted pretty easily.

I just can't play this anymore. Every time I play this game I wish I was playing Agricola instead. Agricola's worker placement mechanism is dated at this point but the game has lasting playability due to the tightness of the game, the depth of the play and the variable starting situations. Caverna omits all of the above except for the dated worker placement mechanism.

Pros:

-It has a neat theme and the player boards look really nice as do the animeeples. The components are top-notch even though I've heard that an entire glen of elves were displaced due to the manufacturing of this game. That's dwarves for you.

-You can play 8 players right out of the box. Though that is a con for me as it drives the price up and I will never be playing this game with 8 players. But for some I'm sure it's a pro.

-There's plenty of room tiles to choose from so there are plenty of decisions in the game. Also it's really neat to build your own little cave and farm.

Cons:

-Setting up this game is annoying. There are so many single tiles that have to be placed in their correct spot on the board. And Caverna takes up a lot of table space. I don't know how you would even play an eight player game. People would need to sit so far away from the tiles that reading the small print might be impossible.

-Rubies. Everything can be solved with rubies! Hey what's that, did another player place their disk on the ruby space already? That's okay, just use the other one.

-There is no stress, there is no tension, there is no competition. It's people sitting around building a farm in a leisurely pace according to some rules. It's almost as much as a toy as it is a game.

-Every game starts the same so you can form a good working strategy and there's a good chance you'll be able to stick with it for the whole game at which point you are just following a predetermined set of moves. Sounds fun. Make sure to check the forums to follow another person's strategy so you don't even have to figure one out on your own.

Caverna is Agricola for babies.

I am not yet sold on this re-iteration of Agricola. While I do think that taking some of the great communal elements of its predecessors Le Havre, Farmers of the Moor, and All Creatures Big and Small, the tension might be worse off from it. While I was initially incredibly excited about the communal buildings (rather than secret and personal occupations and minor improvements), these buildings do not become as tense and fought over as in A:ACBaS. Rather, compared to both its farming younger siblings, the tension feels less present. I believe that this might be due to the game presenting more options and paths to accomplish the goals you set out to do. Furthermore, this then, unfortunately for me, becomes one of those games which you can set out with a strategy from the get-go which the tactical flow of the game has a lesser impact than selecting an appropriate point-generating machine (with the winner best implementing their point machine).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Probably the best of Agricola's siblings, at least so far. The biggest difference is probably that there are no cards... every one of the several dozen buildings is always available, so you're not constrained by the luck of the draw. The volume of options available seems overwhelming at first, but it may be a worthwhile tradeoff to avoid the arbitrariness of the card draw. In fact there is no chance here, with the minor exception of action cards coming out in different rounds, as in Agricola. The other big difference is expeditions. You can arm your workers and send them off to hunt for whatever stuff you decide, limited only by how well armed they are. The better weapons they have, the longer the list of spoils for you to choose from. This is a fun addition, and the rewards for it are well worth the effort.

I'm not sure this is a great game--to say that is derivative would be a massive understatement--yet I can't deny its quality. Will be playing again.

Love, love this game.  I could take a year to review it.  It is the most FULL board game box I've ever purchased and it has enduring re-playability.  Whether playing by yourself (solo variant) or 7 players; this game is full of things to do.  Every player can be successful and enjoy their own board and progress to goals.

The only negatives I have for the game is keeping players efficient on their turns so that downtime is limited in larger group plays (waiting for 6 other players to take action can get boring).

An exemplary elaboration on the classic Euro-style worker placement! Caverna is the perfect game for a lazy afternoon with some friends. Well-paced with many options, giving you numerous avenues for both setting up your resource engine and feeding your family (both of which are the stressful parts of the game). The engines you set up can lead to some adorable themes (XOXO cuddle room), and make each player's home board seem unique from one another. The component quality is extremely high, especially considering the fact that there are hundreds of different game pieces. Although, have (no) fun setting and cleaning up all said hundreds of components, which in turn take up some crazy table space! Prime example of what a worker placement game should be!

I really wanted to love this game and have tried playing it a number of times but there just aren't enough interesting things to do.  With 3-4 players someone would invariably end up with options they weren't interested in and/or wouldn't help them.  The game also ends abruptly.  For some players, it can take a few turns to even get a field or pasture tile or get a shot at planting food, much less making an actual farm.  Then suddenly it's just over. Even winning doesn't feel satisfying.  The components are great, though.

The epitome of all worker placement games.
Theme is super cute, components are lavishly.

For someone like me, that dislikes euros, the theme was so strong that i was kinda bummed that i couldn't just build & do whatever i felt was best for my little dwarfen family.. instead i had to vie for VPs.
But be that as it may.. this is a very good game, and if i would have any interest in euros & would rate this at least an 8 probably higher..

Oh and for your first game you should heed the advice of playing with limited number of buildings.. otherwise you're just getting overwhelmed..

What a great game, it is Agricola II but it does it so much better. This just works so well, the only downside I would give it is that it takes a while to bag up. The box is soooo full of stuff. It is expensive but it is so worth it.
It is worker placement, you are putting dwarfs on card spaces to gather resources and improve your cave / farm.
But if you like this mechanism then you will love this game.

I like this game more than Agricola the fact that there is a duplicator for more players. There is no rush to get more meeple / workers. There is exploration which helps you grow your cave and farming.

Not recommended for newbies but yes will play this game over and over and like the interaction between players and mind draining game!

time takes approx 35-45 minutes per player. Recommend 4-7 players :)

This Uwe game is also untested for me at the moment, but I've heard it's a bit like Agricola but with arguably better theme. Well because I love fantasy and dwarves, I think I will like Caverna's theme a lot more than that of Agricola's. Which one will be better as a game remains to be seen, because as of yet I haven't played either one yet. For now A Feast for Odin is my number one Uwe game.

Will often be compared to it's sister game Agricola.  The general mechanics of the two games are quite similar.  If you like Agricola you will like this one more than likely.

The biggest difference between the two are that all the special rooms are available to be bough by any player.  This makes the game completely wide open with no secret information.  Players will be forced to recognize and react to what opponents are doing.  Personally I like the card driven occupation/improvements more, however the majority of my game group likes this way more. Regardless, still a very fun game.

Excellent game about Dwarf farming and excavation! I think this takes Agricola and turns it up a notch on the fun factor, although I think both games are excellent and would play both in a heartbeat. Overall, I like that Caverna begins as a gentle little game, building your cave and your farm, and by the end the competition for spaces makes it a much more tense interactive end. GREAT game, and a lot of fun!

I think I would like this a lot more if I had played it more.  This is a catch 22 situation I have with several games.  Until I am familiar with all the buildings I don't enjoy this very much, but I won't play a game I don't enjoy much...

Definitely better with fewer people.  My games with three players were fun (if a bit too long), my single game with six was drawn out and painful to play.

Nagyszerű játék, ami erőteljesen hasonlít az Agricolára. Persze így természetes is hogy ezt is jó játéknak tartom. Én az alábbi különbségeket láttam az Agricolához képest. 

Itt nem embereink, hanem törpéink vannak, akik a föld alatt a bányákban dolgoznak, a hegy melletti erdőben pedig állatokat tartanak, illetve ezen terülteteket szánthatják és vethetik be.

Nincsenek kis és nagy fejlesztések, hanem azok a különféle szobafajtákba lettek beépítve. Ezeket a hegy alatt lévő szobák helyére rakhatjuk le. Könnyebb fához jutni és kőhöz. Nincs benne agyag és nád, amelyek helyett vasércet és rubint bányászhatunk. Szerintem sokkal könnyebb etetni, mivel alapból átválthatók az állatok, a búzák, a zöldségek, a győzelmi pontok és a rubinok is kajára. Sűrűbben etetünk, viszont aratás és szaporodás is sűrűbb. 

Ugyanúgy mínusz pontok járnak a felhasználhatatlan területekért, mint az Agricolában, itt viszont a táblát könnyű lefedni, mert egyszerre két területet foglalunk el mind a bányában, mind kint az erdőben. Állatot is könnyebb tartani: szamarak lehetnek a bányákban, vaddisznók az erdőkben, birkák a mezőkön (kutyák őrzik őket). Marhákat csak karámba lehet tartani, de rubinért és kajáért bármikor vehető marha. 
A törpéinket harcos törpére is felfejleszthetjük a bányászott vasérc segítségével, ez azért jó, mert amikor megfelelő küldetésre küldjük, akkor a harcos törpök plusz akciókat hajthatnak végre. Változás, hogy két ételért olyan akciót is végrehajthatunk, amit más már elfoglalt. Ráadásul itt több olyan hely is van, ahol egyszerre két akciót is végrehajthatunk.

Ezek miatt könnyebbnek érzem mint az Agricolát. Hátránya, hogy drága (nem is kapható itthon, kint 65-75 euros játék), de tele van pakolva alkatrésszel. Sokkal vastagabb mint az Agricola doboza, de az alkatrészek teljesen kitöltik a dobozt! A set up része emiatt elég hosszú. Kicsit nyelvfüggő csak, könnyen játszható nyelvtudás nélkül is, mert csak a szobákon van szöveg, ami ki van rakva középre. 

Egyelőre 9-est adok neki, meglátom több játék után hogy fel megy-e az Agricola 10-es szintjére.

----

Játszottam az expert verzióval. Itt jóval több épület jön fel, de azért az újrajátszhatósága meg sem közelíti az Agricoláét.

Like Agricola except the swim course isn't so badly infested with stinging jellyfish and deadly eddies. You can actually compete with other players to win the race rather than spend all your energy to stay afloat.

Caverna takes all the smooth mechanics of it's older sibling and trimmed the gruelling elements. Right length, interweaving mechanics, opportunity to interact with opponents, many ways to win and most of all, fun.

Regardless of the Agricola-Caverna debate which is a better game, the designer has done brilliantly well to craft 2 games via the same core mechanics that captures so different audiences.

I love Caverna almost as much as a I love Agricola.  The theme is definitely lighter, there is more stuff to do, and all of your actions seem good.  The only thing I think that is missing is a variance element in the form of Occupations and Minor Improvements that Agricola had.  Still a remarkable game though.

I love the many different paths to victory and love building up a farm and cave system.  I love that it simplified Agricola's scoring and made fences nicer.  I don't mind the lack of Agricola's cards because I feel there is enough variety in Caverna's buildings, and I likely won't play the dozens of times it takes to tire of them.

Agricola version 2. Gone is the random deal of cards of variable utility, gone is the ghastly 'must have a vegetable' moment, gone are the near identical farms at game end. Instead the Occupation and Upgrade cards are replaced by a large set of rooms that offer in-game abilities and end-game bonuses. Not everything is wonderful in this brave new world, however. The Guest Room and Office Room are insanely powerful and should probably be banned by sensible groups. There's a new Exploration feature that allows for weapon building and quests for plunder, but it's not essential to take part. This is very much the same game, but overall balance and opportunity for divergent strategies are massively improved. Indeed there's so much diversity that old time Agricola players can be caught out. It's essential to pick a strategy and run with it, doing 'a bit of everything' is a short route to losing.
Just a comment about production values: this is a lavishly produced game, but at £75 with online discount, I'm starting to get concerned that the price of Eurogames is moving beyond what can be justified even for game enthusiasts. The provision for 6/7 players is just silly and has inflated the component count for little gameplay return. Please, publishers, let's keep it real.

This game is on the back end of my personal Top 100 list.  Its a nice implementation of Agricola with more interesting flavor and more interesting decisions than its predecessor.  It is a fine action selection and resource acquisition game where you try to build a suitable engine to fuel your endgame victory.  It lacks though in that it is easy to get stuck in repetitive play processes in the game as some lines of play feel dull or under-powered, which is why it may appeal more to some players than others.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I've only played this once (at time of writing) but I feel qualified to rate it a 10 based on that one game because I know it's father, Agricola, so well, and I feel like I can tell how it will play with future plays. And that is; well. Caverna has a plethora of interesting options to take, a variety of paths-to-victory (which base-set-only Agricola is kinda missing), and the same gorgeous components, tense gameplay, and tight strategy.

My only complaint is that the random harvests are exceptionally annoying. Since you more or less always have to plan for the worst possible outcome anyway, it's basically just occasionally, you randomly get some free resources. I know a lot of people dislike the overload of up-front building options in the full version, and while I can see that may be a problem for some, it isn't for me, I actually really like that.

I hope that expansions are forthcoming and that they give it more replay value, especially since there isn't such an obivous expansion route as Agricola.

RATING: N/A
Colocación de trabajadores ambientado en un clan de enanos que decide dedicarse a mejorar sus cuevas y dominios exteriores. Inevitable compararlo con Agricola. 

La premisa del juego es similar a su primo mayor: gestionas una familia de enanos que tiene acceso tanto a su caverna para obtener recursos de la minería así como a sus dominios exteriores de alrededor. Es el mismo sistema de juego que Agricola: un jugador elige una acción, la ejecuta y el siguiente elige cualquier otra y la ejecuta, revelándose más acciones conforme el juego avanza.

Uwe Rosemberg ha diseñado un gran juego tras años de feedback de los jugadores de Agricola. Añade nuevas mecánicas que parecen hacer el juego menos exigente con la alimentación de la familia y expanden las formas de ganar de su predecesor. Estas mecánicas son:

- La ausencia de cartas. La viarabilidad y los poderes especiales de oficios y adquisiciones menores se ven sustituidas por las habitaciones, que están al alcance de todos.

- Aventuras. Una mecánica que emplea la acción de forjar gracias a un nuevo recurso llamado mineral. Permite obtener mejores recursos conforme mejore la calidad del armamento.

- Reduce la importancia de la familia. Ahora es más sencillo alimentarla (no hace falta convertir el trigo en pan o cocinar los animales) y sus miembros otorgan menos PV´s que en Agricola (1 PV en vez de 3 PV´s).

- Al igual que en Ora et Labora, la situación de las habitaciones en el tablero personal, cobra su importancia.

- Hay un recurso que puede usarse como comodín (rubíes).

Si buscas un final más abierto, un juego más permisivo con los errores y con un sentido más claro de "construir algo", decántate por Caverna. Si buscas un juego más esstricto que recomepnse al más habilidoso, Agricola.

PROS: Menos punitivo. De entrada, menos exigente para novatos.

CONS: Partidas más largas. Mesa extremadamente grande para jugarlo a gusto. Montarlo (y desmontarlo) necesita más tiempo del que piensas.

Una versione semplificata di Agricola, da cui sono state tolte le carte.

Thematically weaker than Agricola. You "fight" but there is no interaction in it. Multiplayer solitaire. 

I find it very surprising that this game is praised so much despite its mediocre replayability. Sure, there are tons of different buildings but they are available in every game.  For a heavy game the card and harvesting draws introduce a relatively high amount of luck. Compare this with Terra Mystica, where the combination of factions, round bonuses (and end scorings) are unique in each game.

Was advertised (to me) as "fixed" Agricola.  Definitely has the Agricola feel . . . with a few twists.  Overall, a bit more forgiving than Agricola - which I do like.  And does "fix" the imbalanced cards in Agricola, by having all improvements available to everyone.

My guess is that different people will prefer one over the other for their own reasons.  I think I like this one just a wee bit more than Agricola.

One of the Uwe's masterpieces.

Brilliant game but comparing to Agricola, it is a little easy to play and survive but had many alternatives for players.

I dont agree that it is told Caverna is a Agricola fixed. Agricola has different way of approach and a much more tensed game, but it is true Caverna is offering much more options to players.

With 5 or more players it has become unnecessary long game.

Caverna is essentially the sequel to Agricola with a giant tile pool instead of a hand of cards. I'm less inclined to like it as much as the 'Gric. The player cards in Agricola were a plus for me rather than a detriment; and the splay of room tiles in Caverna is a ton of open information to soak in compared to the cards you're handed in 'Gric.

Still, Caverna does a lot of things that make me go "I wish Agricola thought of this." The collect resource actions that add more resources to their offer if they're empty is smart, knowing when the "get new worker" option is coming into play is nice, and I guess overall the game feels more streamlined.

There are differences enough between the two, at least in strategy (Adventure actions in Caverna alone make a huge change). Still, Agricola (especially with its expansion) wins my heart.

Essen 2012 release, want to know more.  Recently saw an updated post, not to be expected until Essen 2013.

At long last, it's published!  An automatic purchase, ordered.

Pretty good game, but wish it was closer to the original, which I definitely still prefer.  Really miss the variety based on the cards - don't enjoy the system of having all the same building available every game.  Also a bit too busy between the adventures, rubies, animals & dogs, etc. 

Sold in July 2015 large craigslist lot sale.  In all situations, I'd rather play Agricola, and in the interests of keeping the collection lean, I moved it along.

My first foray into the world of Uwe Rosenberg. This game accomplishes complete immersion through sheer variety of choice, and perfect marriage of theme and mechanism.

In this game every player takes control of one tribe of dwarfs and compete against other tribes for being the most successful one, by improving its land, which is divided in 2 areas: cave and forest. The cave has to be opened by digging tunnels and setting up rooms or other different locations and the forest is destined for farming crops and animals. Each player has an action for every dwarf, starting with 3 and increasing the number up to 6.
Positive:
1. Very thematic
2. Many strategies can be followed

"Cave Madness" is what I dubbed this before playing and to me it sticks after my one game. Right off the hop, the biggest thing you notice and biggest difference from its father is the crazy myriad of options, really there are too many and I think Uwe may have slipped a little here as I don't see why he would not have scaled the amount of green buildings to the number of players. Having ~20 of them out in a 2 player game seems silly, to give you some idea there are already so many options in the game not only did I not buy a green building my first game I did not even look at them. 10 would be plenty and would cut down AP at least for first 10 games, it would also be interesting to see which come out game to game too, easy tweak at any rate, 10 for 2player, 12-14 for 3player.... (or maybe this is actually suggested in rules? edit apparently family version has less but not that many less and still not scaled to player #)

Anyway Gric (with drafting of course) is in my top 5 so this had a lot to live up too for me, and its unquestionable Gric 2.0 and Uwe made no attempts to conceal it as it is very very much the same game "mechanically". There are a good number of differences and reasons why you would also consider owning both however, and these are what really make the game interesting as well. Also on this topic, I should probably address the whole lack of tension and related comments as I think they have been somewhat overstated and maybe even incorrectly stated in some instances. Now probably THE biggest difference here from Gric is FLEXIBILITY as in Gric, everything is sooooo tight and this really ramps up angst and tension. Here, yes things are not as tight, feeding is more flexible (still not "easy"), there are potentially (edit see update) more strategic paths to take and flexibility in those paths, and more things up for grabs in the tactical grab game as well HOWEVER, you still want to do way more than you will ever be able to so while the "tension"' is somewhat lower, turn angst is still ever present and not "gone" and creates its own tension so don't be fooled. 
  
I think the biggest strength here is the vast amount of game to explore, I'm thinking a good 10 to 15 games just testing out the many strategic paths here, then many many more trying the hone those paths through all the flexibility you have within each one.  This alone I think will push me to fork over the $70 and force a spot on my overcrowded shelf for it. As I said Gric is a top 5 for me largely due to the incredible tightness, tension and impending doom you must fight to escape creating a real gaming challenge each play and leaving you with a true satisfaction when and if you've built a good farm. So while this mostly falls short of Gric in those departments, Uwe gave some of us the one thing we wondered if Gric was sort of missing, true strategic flexibility as this is much much more open in this department. 

I do wish they would have left this for 5 players; I am very unlikely to play with more, if ever, like many I imagine, so having less “stuff” for less money would have been better and leave the 6 and 7 player craziness for an expansion.  One other thing, while having the buildings face up is nice as you get to work towards them, there is the AP factor as mentioned but worse is the PIC (player induced chaos) factor.  You might have your eye on two of the yellow end game buildings, only to see them get snatched away 2 turns before you were going to build them, and they are big points and for this reason I would have liked to see a few more yellow and a few less green buildings, something we can tweak when the expansion comes out. 
 
Summary – Nice variant, feeding is a little easier due to flexibility, a little more flexible strategically, buildings are open to anyone to build so a screwage/chaos factor vs cards and here no cards at all.  

[u]UPDATE[/u]: 2nd play again with 2 players. Maybe not quite as flexible and open as I first thought, but a LOT more than Gric. The thing is, you just don’t have enough time, there are SO many harvests and you need food which is animals and veggies, and you need somewhere to PUT those things, and you want mines, and you want/need this_that_and_the_other_thing so damn, its tough, and very similar to the Father here, so much so, that my rating here reflects a whole point docked for being too much the same. 

2 players probably best for me due to the PIC I mentioned above, which is the biggest negative in the game to me (set-up/tear down nasty too). Think of the green buildings like minor improvements as it seems this is essentially what they are, trouble is now they are open to everyone; playing with 5 players but want that ruby building? Good luck, so do 2 other people. Same with the yellow buildings but worse as these are higher points. Now there is a fair amount to go around, and it could be argued that maybe you don't even need to build many buildings, or any, to win (likely jury out still on this). For me though at any rate, you have less control here than Gric on these important factors, and this is the other reason this is a whole rating point lower for me.  

=======================

Donkeeples and Dogeeples... 

Less theme, less tension and less cards. hmmmmm looks like steps in the wrong direction for me. 

Don't think there is room for this on my shelf, for people that found Gric stressful in a bad way, this might be for you. Need to play, if I had more room I might consider

This is definitely spiritual successor to Agricola, but the changes it makes for me are definitely improvements. The two biggest things are that the special powers have moved from cards which are randomly distributed to a common offer of tokens, and that the scoring opportunities are loosened, so there's now more than one strategy. The common offer of buildings eliminates the possibility of someone just getting better cards. The scoring is changed in a couple ways, first of all things went from thresholds to 1-1 point opportunities, e.g. instead of vegetables only ever scoring you 4 points no matter how many you have you get 1 point per leftover vegetable. Also, a fair amount of the building tiles (that replaced the cards) are bonus scoring tiles, so you can cater your scoring opportunities to whatever you're doing. And crucially family members are only worth one point each at the end of the game, so they aren't as necessary to max out. It's also much easier to feed your people but I still feel like food doesn't do enough and so you feel punished for overproducing, though to a bit lesser of an extent than in Agricola. But really I just find myself enjoying the game when I play it, I appreciate the variety of things to do and the variety of ways to get things, and I think that the way I'm naturally inclined to play this game (just do what seems fun and make a cool farm) is much easier to do here than in Agricola. I think the fact that the theme comes through so well makes it hard for me to play these like efficiency strategy games and in this game you can do that and still do well.

Since there's no variable setup it is possible to just do the same thing every game, but I feel like that's sort of missing the point. People in my group purposely choose to do different things every game for fun, so that kind of self imposed variety works for us. But it might not work for everyone, and I can see the game getting stale fast if you let it (though I'd be inclined to argue that if that happens it's really on you).

UPDATE: I'm a little less excited by this game. I still think most of what I said above is true, but I'm just less interested in a game like this, where it's more about the narrative and the journey than it is about the mechanics. Granted, there are a couple of games like this that I enjoy, but the point is my favorites in this category give me what I consider more interesting narrative experiences. Also, I'm less enamored by worker placement unless it adds a unique twist and this is pretty standard worker placement. Still happy to play now and then, though.

It's hard to pick between this and Agricola. I really like the initial phase in Agricola of trying to figure out what to make with your professions and improvements, and looking for synergy between your cards. But I think that the game play in Caverna is slightly better. In the end, I'm going to rate them the same and just say that I'm happy to play either any time.

Comparing to Agricola:

Pros:

1) The feel and look of all the new pieces compared to just placing a card or fence.
2) No more luck of the draw as to who gets the best starting hand.
3) It's not as hard to feed, HOWEVER in order to get a high score there is still just as much importance in feeding efficiently.
4) The victory points system has been cleaned up, you still need to get one of each animal type, and have no free spaces, but otherwise you can specialize in whatever you want with no maximum points (you can have 16 animals in a double pasture with 2 stables now).
5) It is still an incredibly skillful game, despite it's differences to Agricola.

-----------

Cons:

1) Other than the order in which the round cards come out, the game has no other random setup (there is competition for buildings (each building is unique) on top of the normal worker placement denial to affect strategy though), also on top of who is going animals/crops you also need to pay attention to who is going expeditions so your strategy is not conflicting too much with others. But the game still requires human interaction to create a unique game each time rather than board setup.
2) Players do not start the game with their own unique circumstances (does not have to be cards) to give you an incentive to try a certain strategy.

Minor cons:

3) I'm not convinced on the random harvests, if you get all the normal harvests early on, growing your family can be a nightmare, and the alternative harvest markers can really mess with your strategy. (says the person complaining about no random setup)
4) I'm also not convinced on the expeditions, they don't feel quite right, but this is very very minor and I have no idea what I'd change about them.

-----------

In conclusion: The game is awesome, I just fear that once you've figured it out (especially in 2player) it will loose it's re-playability. From then on it will still be a lot of fun, but only playing 3-5 player with equally skilled players (the competition for buildings with enough players should make the game different every time). I have no interest in playing this 6-7player unless everyone is both a FAST player and knows all the buildings very well.

Saying all that, I have no doubt that I will get my money's worth out of this game, but it does not replace Agricola because of the first two cons (if they were fixed in an expansion, I would never play Agricola again). It is however better than most other euro's out there.

Update after 30 plays: 

Still a great game, but no longer a game that I want to play too often. Have gone back to Agricola which is still interesting every time even after 50+ plays. Still a keeper though! It needs an expansion which would need to include:
1) more buildings
2) variable setup (which would need well balanced rules, not just draw x number of random buildings of each colour)
3) unique player starting positions
4) something else to add another dimension to the game

It's the best parts of [b][thing=31260]Agricola[/thing][/b] and [b][thing=119890]All Creatures[/thing][/b] combined into one huge game. I like it a lot.

There is not nearly as much of the feeling of hopeless struggle in this game as there is in Agricola.

Scoring is much more reasonable than it is in Agricola, and it eliminates the runaway leader problem present in Agricola.

I'm comparing it to Agricola, because it's basically Agricola -- [i]only better![/i] It uses many identical rules.

I joined in on a game of this not knowing this was actually an Agricola variant/re-implementation... as I'm not a fan of Agricola.  Was pleasantly surprised this was a better game...

... gone is the luck factor in the cards which imho ruins Agricola, instead the cave "furnishings" tiles which replace the cards are available to everyone.  Only randomness is in order that new actions become available and when you have a harvest and have to feed your workers... but this is same for everyone.

Still much prefer Le Harve out of all the games in Uwe's series of worker placement/farming games, but this one is at least better than Agricola and who knows, if I ever play again maybe my rating will go up some unlike Agricola.

Excellent game. It feels just like Agricola in a sandbox. Fun theme. The components are absolutely top notch!

Some caveats: I HIGHLY recommend getting the Broken Token organizer for this one. I played it once using baggies and it was a SLOG to set up and keep getting resources. The organizer makes it easy as can be! Secondly, it would be nice if they had only included the components for 5 players. I can never see playing this with 7 unless everyone knows the game very well, and it would have brought the price point to a more appealing level.

Plays easy with Agricola veterans. Tiles are varied and change the game mechanics. Learn the cost and function of the tiles for maximum effectiveness. Plenty of ways to end the game with huge bonuses, and the game allows different paths to victory. Theme works great. Agricola for the fantasy player (without the dragons and trolls). I suspect the game is limiting if all or even a few of the players learn to stack different room tile abilities to maximise points. For veteran players, a minimum of a 100 points is normal. For complete newbies who don't utilise the full value of the room-combinations, you may score anywhere from 45-70.

My kids have spoken... way better than Agricola!  They like that there are more options and the quests or "expeditions".

Hands down out of the box base game, better than Agricola base game. I can't compare it to the expansions.  However, I see that Caverna is ripe for expansions in the cavern room tiles.

First off, very similar to Agricola in gameplay.  Instead of many decks of cards to start your pre-game draft of Agricola, there are many cavern room tiles for bonuses that you can draft throughout the game.  The only tiles with multiple copies is the basic dwelling tiles, everything else is limited to only one kind which can supplement your strategy.

Second, way better components than Agricola and more of them.  Instead of simple wooden round tokens, you have nicely shaped tokens that are thematic to what they represent.  New are donkeys, dogs, ore, rubies, weapons, and coins.  

Third, it is not as punishing as Agricola, but allows players to choose more varied strategic paths to victory.  Agricola feels more limited and forces you down the same path as everyone else, whereas Caverna feels more freeing in that respect.

Fourth, expeditions are great.  Sometimes they feel like "cheating" because they help you work around other people taking your action or resource you need.  However, it's very well designed, so as to not be too overpowering and does cost you either in the amount you can get from loot or changing the order of your workers.

Awesome Game!!!

Even though this is a 3 hour game right now for my kids and I, they still enjoy it better than 3 hours of Sid Meier's of Civilization.

Initial rating: 8.5 (January 2014)

As expected, Caverna is a great GREAT game. It is very reminiscent of Agricola (of course) but when the game was explained to me, I was surprised how different it was. I was expecting a very similar game but Caverna has a lot of new things, enough add-ons that, for me, the game feels very different than Agricola and this is very positive in my book! It now comes with Dogs!! Love the dogs and I´m also happy that they don’t provide any food :D. I couldn´t eat my dog to avoid starvation anyway. I like the new scoring system, instead of having limits you always will win a VP if you have more vegetables, cows, donkeys, etc.

The game components are awesome, except for the disappointing start player token. It is out of place with such high quality components. The game box is big and is filled with bits. I also dig the new fantasy theme. Agricola`s was very boring.

On the bad side, I feel Caverna is a little less tense than Agricola, it has an imitation action space that (practically) guarantees that you will have the needed action available on your turn. Also, I’m not sure I would want to play with 6 or 7 players. Even with 5 it can be a long game. I’m open to try this exactly once to see how the games flows, with 7 players the game can be very tigh (I guess) but I feel the downtime would be excessive. Also I think Caverna has a lot less replayability than Agricola, The cards were replaced by tiles and over time the game can get samey as there are few tiles (compared with the amount of cards in Agricola). The expedition actions are very powerful, a player can feed his family with this kind of actions alone. For some reason, I don’t like this part of the game as much as the whole. I think if a player skip totally the expeditions, he will lose the game, making them a dominant strategy. 

In the night board there are some features that are hard to see.

Bottom line, Caverna is a great game. I think it is a bit better than Agricola, but it doesn’t replace the game for me, so I think I will have both of them in my collection :D. For now I’m only worried about the replayability factor in Caverna and I won’t say no to a game. Great game, I totally recommend it.

After more plays, I think I don’t like the expeditions because they feel (a little) overpowered and have no thematic sense. How can I go to an expedition and furnish a room? Also how can my weapon get better with time? It should be like Robinson Crusoe, each time I use my weapon, it should degrade.

Still, these concerns are very minor and I still love Caverna.

After even more plays, I’m getting a bit bored. I have lost a game when I had 5 family members and the winning player only had 2, but they were level 14 dwarf who only went to expeditions x 4. This alone made him win the game. The expeditions are overpowered as they effectively give you up to 4 actions with a single dwarf. Every player who has ignored the expeditions has lost in our games. This is THE dominant strategy. 

There is almost no tension in the game, you don’t have to worry (much) about losing an space to an opponent, there are repeat spaces and the imitation one that allows you to get what you want when you want it. In the feeding phase you can exchange everything for food. I miss Agricola’s tension.

Also the game is very samey every time I play it. I miss Agricola´s cards (variability). 

I retract myself and now I think Agricola is the superior game by a lot. 

I enjoy Caverna but now I don’t think I will buy it.

Nowadays I almost never want to play a Caverna game, It is a good game but it feels very samey each play and it has low tension. Agricola is the better game for me so I don’t think I will be playing much Caverna in the near future, instead I still need to play lots of decks  I have bought for Agricola.
 
I’m glad I didn’t acquire it.

My current desire to play Caverna is very low, due to this I’m downgrading its rating to one I feel is deserved by the game. For me, Caverna is an average/mediocre game. I got tired of it with very few plays while I have played Agricola around 80 times and I still want to play it. Caverna´s static setup practically guarantees there is a dominant strategy, also it lacks a lot of tension which is why I love Agricola. Perhaps the only superior thing Caverna has over Agricola is how the family members are scored, perhaps 3 points per family member is too much, but you can add this rule to Agricola easily and without any pain.

I will do my best to stay away from this game, and I’m eagerly awaiting the new edition of Agricola.

Elegant design. Not as complex as it seems. Not too hard to teach and once you understand the game a rich 2 player round can be played in less than a hour. Expeditions and mining add a fun adventuring component to the game that provide a level of theme and variety that was absent from Agricola (and why I was turned off by Agricola originally - running a farm just did not excite me). In Caverna, the task of managing your farm, cave, and workers with lots and lots of available choices for placing your workers and buying upgrades can be a real brain burner - but a fun one with lots to chew on.  Although not a problem for me, some folks have a valid criticism that by providing all tile upgrade options from the very start, players begin the game with an overwhelming amount of options rather than being able to chart a unique path based on strategy cards (i.e., Agricola). While true, it is simply up to the player to be creative and explore different paths to victor rather than the game nudging you in a certain direction.

RATING: 9
I'm unsure whether I can rate Caverna fairly at this point.  I am erring on the low side; it's somewhere between an 8 and a 10.

There is more of a feeling of abundance in Caverna than in Agricola, a move toward the "resource playground" style of Le Havre and Ora et Labora.  Animals can convert to food without a cooking implement, expeditions provide infusions of resources, rubies serve as wild cards, to name a few examples.  Though this is still a game where the harvest matters in a way more stressful than in Le Havre or Ora; the food requirements will still take some effort to meet and can't be blown off with a well-timed loan.

I like the expeditions and the reduction in importance on family growth.  I wonder how much replayability there will be with the fixed set of furnishings.  Probably I will have an opinion on that after a couple more plays.

While I was very excited to play this one, with no variability between each plays this one suffers same problem as Ora et Labora. For a lonesome player such as myself, this one is simply a puzzle with $80 price tag that comes with hefty nice looking components.

It looks grandly fun to play with others, but for me to purchase it, the game better have to come with solitaire rules for me to consider a space in my shelf. It is very frustrating as I was truly looking forward to this one.

Disregard my initial impressions as I just finished placing order on this. I was able to get a great deal on this game ($65) and could not pass up on the offer. I loved Dwarf Fortress - and this is the closest imitation of that in board game. I will try my best to come up with solo variant where I can play differently each time.

This game is actually quite fun! I am glad that I got this. Buying the tiles, and going to expedition feels just right! I was very skeptical in the beginning but I love it. Need to play a bit more times, but my first impression is that this game immediately replaces Agricola. The theme immediately grabbed a hold of me and I have fun just playing around tiles. I have bunch of variants popping up in my head to makes this game more fun for me.

RATING: 9.2
On initial impression the game didn't feel as good as Agricola but after a few plays(solo) the game has better strategies available with all the different buildings.  It also plays at a quicker pace to Agricola with the speed in which your board develops due to the more dual action spaces that are available.  It is far less stressful when it comes to feeding your family mainly due to the fact that you can convert things into food at anytime rather than waiting to build an oven and taking the bake bread action. 

Only had a few games multiplayer which was a woeful 7 player game (I think this should only be played with people who are completely familiar with the game) and my first game which was 2 player.  Looking forward to more multi-player games with gamers and more manageable numbers.

I prefer the open buildings of Caverna, (to Agricola) However, I very much dislike them being the exact same each game. I'd much prefer there to be a random cycle of buildings available each game, to make the games different. In my few games, I've seen a meta develop among players who don't do anything new or different. Agricola cards force you to try new things. Caverna is the same game each play.

As advertised, this is Agricola II.  They both offer tense playing experiences that I can see myself going back and forth with.  Agricola is great if you want to take 14 random (or draft) cards to establish your path within the game.  Caverna removes the randomness of card draw/draft and offers 48 different buildings at the beginning of the game that help shape your path.  Both are great games and I wouldn't be surprised to Caverna, Le Havre, and Agricola all in the top 10.

Like Agricola but with more bling and less variety. I tend not to play Agricola with the cards (a bit too swingy) so the lack of variety doesn't currently bother me and the iconography means the game flows better that the original game.

Not too sure I could pick between them.  Yes, they're very similar but still believe they both deserve a spot in my collection.

Either way, this is a top, top game.

Played only solo.  The game is much more forgiving than Agricola with lots of play options.  

I think given the furnishing tiles are unique, there will be much more contention for building them.  Construction spaces are somewhat limited - although if you forge or quest for a sufficiently high level weapon - you can furnish your cavern.

From the rules, it sounds like there are two major paths: weapons and non-weapons.  From solo practice, it seemed like the flexibility of questing had real benefit.  Perhaps this won't play out quite as obviously with more players.

Caverna is Uwe's spiritual and mechanical successor to Agricola. In Caverna, the players' dwarfs not only build pastures, plant crops and build out their homes, they also hollow out their mountains and mine for ore and rubies as well as go on "expeditions" for additional resources and actions. The mechanics are about 80% the same as Agricola, making it feel like a variant game, but in saying that, Caverna very much stands on its own and many prefer it.

The main difference is that Caverna does away with the hand of minor improvements and occupations and instead puts the special abilities and bonuses on a display of tiles that players can build into their caves, first come first served. This removes the potential imbalance that one player's hand of cards has over another, but at the cost of decreasing variability of strategy from one play to the next. There are still certainly plenty of options - so this isn't a problem - it's strictly a matter of preference and is the key reason why some people like one game over the other. Personally, I love getting my hand of cards in Agricola and using them to shape my strategy for the game. The other big difference is the idea of using ore to arm your dwarfs and sending them on expeditions. An armed dwarf has a token on it that can start out at a value as high as 8 and eventually rise to as high as 14. Some actions allow an armed dwarf to get 1-4 items from a list that gets better as a dwarf's level gets higher. Dwarfs level up after every expedition they undertake. It's an interesting way of applying worker strength and gaining benefits by investing in it.

Caverna was published 5 years after Agricola and, while there are a lot of mechanical similarities, this is where Uwe starts to explore moving from tight interactions and lots of bumping elbows to having players make decisions based on an over-abundance of choices. His later games, Fields of Arle and A Feast for Odin (which I have yet to play), go even further in this direction. While I prefer his tighter games I don't dislike the more open decision space of these later ones. I find it cool that in the history of Uwe's games, there is a clear evolution of core ideas and a sense that Uwe is taking his audience with him on his explorations. He presents clear design choices that players can easily recognize and compare from one game to the next, which in turn enhances all of our understanding of design and contributes to our maturity as a gaming audience. In other words, I see his publications as a dialogue that continues to evolve and keeps me interested in how he will next shape the conversation.

A nice step up from light weight worker placement. Plenty of choices and paths to your victory points and you get to be a dwarf in a cave - very sweet. I love the components and the vast number of them.

Rating after about five plays, just about all within the first three months after the game came out.  Doesn't get alot of play these days, and game length is an issue if you ever try a full table of seven.  Believe it is an improvement to Agricola, less randomness in the initial card draw being replaced with a daunting array of buildings available to all players at the outset.  However, there are still some random elements I don't like.  Much prefer BrewCrafters as my worker placement game of choice these days (2015).

The game is meh... what I dislike is that the numerous options don't seem to differ too much... at any point you will have numerous options available, but all seem to be equally good. Of course, you can work out the details to see which ones are truly better, but it doesn't seem to be worth the AP-ing time...

Don't like the fiddliness of the weapons. I'll probably give this game one more try...

RATING: 7
An amazingly deep game, but very uncommon to find enough people willing to play it long enough to make it interesting. Unfortunately, not usually worth the huge setup and teardown times, and is most likely to become one of those games that sits on the shelf and makes you wonder why you spent so much money on something you use so rarely.

But if you have the fortune to find a group who would enjoy consistently playing this game, it would be very well worth it. Not likely to make a big splash for groups that like to try something new all the time.

The only problem with this game is that it's hard to introduce players to it because of all the buildings and actions you can take. Even with the introductory set with half the buildings it's a bit overwhelming unlike other game where buildings are introduced gradually. It also takes a few game to figure out the general path you should follow to get good points (most eurogames with VP are guilty of this so it's minor).

Fantastic farming sim. A pain to setup but that's helped by a plano case for all the beautiful wood in the game. So many options and things to do, lots of pathways to victory and lots of interesting decisions to make. Just great.  Lack of variable setup is a flaw, however, and an expansion to fix it STILL hasn't shown up. Weapons and adventuring also feel overpowered in my games, but that may be because Erin never explores it. 
EDIT: Been experimenting by starting each player with 2 wood and 2 stone and having them start the game buying one of 3 randomly drawn starting caverns. Seems like a fair way to add some variability.

Basically the  same as Agricola, but there are more options and more ways to get food.  Also removes the luck element as there are no cards.
I probably just prefer Agricola as it is less bloated.  There are perhaps too many options in Caverna, so takes away the pressure and competitive nature.
I don't like to play with more than 4 players and would not play with 6 or 7 (unless I was outvoted).  There is too much downtime.
I also enjoyed this game with two players.
I think agricola edges it, but this is a great game and more friendly.

On the one hand, Caverna is another version of Agricola making it easy to pick up for any player of Agricola. Game turns and decisions are similar. It fights for the same spot in terms of table time and complexity.
On the other hand, Caverna provides a different enough playing experience. It's less of an uphill battle of nourishing your family while trying to get something done. There's always something useful to do to scrape together a few VP's. There's more variation in strategies due to the available buildings for game end scoring. End results won't be as punishing as they can be in Agricola.
Is it sufficiently different to warrant owning both? Probably for lovers of Agricola and gamers not worrying about the size of their collection. It's a very good variation on an outstanding game. But I wouldn't mind just playing Agricola instead if Caverna wasn't available.
Finally, a few specific ponderings:
- Totally skipping expeditions seems difficult and doing a bit of them is probably a strategic must unless everybody else is doing them and focus can be shifted to less competed areas. 
- The introduction of a ruby-based economy raises the resource conversion game to a new level, possibly a level too high for my liking as there might be the chance for exploits.
- I don't want to experience the down time with six or seven players, even less the frustration if the player to your left consistently takes first player and six other players act before you get your first turn.

RATING: 6
Feels like the system of Le Havre brought to the world of Agricola with a dwarf theme added for good measure. I really think the Cave Farmers is misleading, as it suggests no element of fantasy. Also, there is no farming done in the cave, but mining. All in all, I enjoyed my play and felt like many of the changes were improvements overall. But, as has been said before by many, there is little to no tension compared to Agricola. That tension probably makes this game more fun to play in person during game night, depending on your group. However, Agricola is so much more exciting. Especially that amazing iPad app. Caverna is one notch below it in my book. I also disliked how the rooms disappeared as the game carried on. Though I've only played once, I can imagine that the best players will be able to find an ideal strategy and exploit it. There is very little random in the game at all.

Competent worker placement, but if that's what you want, there are better games around. Also has lost much of the charm of Agricola and replaced it with lots of up-front complexity. And jeez, is this fiddly. I've played once, seen it played twice. The playtime in those three sessions has ranged from 3.5 to 4.5h, which is just way too much for what this game is.

I initially thought that it was kind of an OK game, but recently was close to having to play it again due to how the tables were split. This made me realize I'd rather sit the game out completely than play Caverna again.

After reading the rules, one gets an idea, that it is very similar to Agricola. However after playing it you start to think, that it contains less stress. It doesn't look that impossible to feed ones population. Moreover, there is no feeling that it ends prematurely right after everything starts running smoothly. On the other hand, it is definitely not easy and light. There are plenty of choice and you cannot concentrate one everything. However, if you don't have some mandatory things at the end of the game, you get negative points... To sum up, the players must constantly balance and choose between "a little bit of everything" and "a lot of something single". And then there are other players... You have to choose an action not too late. On the other hand, how can you do that, when you need everything. It is a deep game, which includes a lot of planning, however it doesn't cause too much unneeded tension.

Pagal taisykles, žaidimas panašus į Agricola. Kita vertus, žaidžiant išryškėja, kad streso jame yra mažiau. Žmonių maitinimas nesukelia tiek galvos skausmo. Be to, nėra to jausmo, kad kai tik pradeda viskas veikti, žaidimas ima ir pasibaigia. Kita vertus, jis tikrai nėra paprastas ir lengvas. Pasirinkimo daug, į viską koncentruotis negali. Tačiau jeigu neturi tam tikrų būtinų elementų, žaidimo gale gauni neigiamų taškų... Žodžiu, vyksta nuolatinė kova ir balansavimas tarp "visko po truputį" ir "kažko vieno daug". Ir dar kiti žaidėjai... Reikia spėti pasirinkti veiksmą ne per vėlai. Bet kaip tai padaryti, kai pradžioje iš esmės visko reikia. Žodžiu, gilus žaidimas, reikalaujantis planavimo, bet be bereikalingos perteklinės įtampos.

The spiritual sequel to Agricola.  Once we get more used to it, should play faster.  Some building balance issues but mainly on the fact that some are pretty useless instead of some are too good.

5/27/2016: This game fired Agricola for me (although I still enjoy Agricola and play it on occasion on the iPad). Although the setup is the same every time and one could play the exact same every time and achieve the same results each time, I cant imagine playing like that. It would be like doing the same thing every time in Chess and expecting to win every time. You need to adapt to what your opponent is doing and try to one up them to come out as the victor. Im not sure if the static setup will bother me after more plays, but through 9 plays, its a non-issue for me.

While this is definitely on the Agricola side of the Rosenberg Euro development tree, I wouldn't characterize it as "Agricola 2"; it's a new game, even if few of the elements will seem terribly different. No hand of cards: yay. A ton of options available from the start whose relative values will be unknowable to a beginner: hm, but probably works fine when you get used to it all. Prosper by specializing and not being arbitrarily hampered by opponents' actions: hmm, but maybe works differently at different player counts.

I've only played this once at BGG Con 2014.

It legitimately may be better than Agricola, which is quite a statement, but I think it's too fiddly for my taste.  The set-up and take down of this game was painful.  So many bits, so many tiles, so many meeples and gems... by the time we finally got to play I was already dreading having to put it all away.  If I owned this I'd keep it in Plano boxes which would help, but it's still quite a bear.

If I didn't have to help set up and tear down I'd want to play it all the time, maybe an app or something but as it stands I have no burning desire to play again, Agricola scratches the same itch, it's still a great game and it's way easier to jump into.

As others mentioned, it's a streamlined Agricola.  In many ways it's a lot better, especially for the inexperienced player as the feeling of "OMFG I can't do anything" is replaced with "OMFG what do I do?".  It's a lot less stressful.

Once you've played both Agricola and Cave Farmers extensively, I'd argue most would side with Agricola as the superior game because of the cards dynamics.

Either way, both games are fantastic.

I like this game alot. Its basically a slightly more simplified and friendlier Agricola. Visually its very attractive.

That said though, its not a "Agricola Killer" as some make it out it be, although it is very good. I personally prefer Agricola for the drafting of cards at the start and for the increased pressure and planning that Agricola demands of you.

Although, both games are excellent in their own right and I don't see a problem in owning both.

RATING: 7
Fun game which is much better than its predecessor Agricola.  Caverna eliminates Agricola's card drafting phase and instead provides many different buildings that are available to be bought by anyone right from the start of the game.  The harshness of feeding one's family has been tamed and the list of mandatory things one must complete each game to avoid highly detrimental penalties is much less confining.  These differences allow the player more freedom to choose their own path to victory which makes the game less stressful and more enjoyable.

The huge shoe box containing ten pounds of pieces makes set up rather involved and tear down too.  Also it's an expensive game.

This is a game where you'll be lost the first few times you play.  The more time you spend playing it the better you'll understand all the options and possibilities available.  Differences between each players experience level is going to have a large impact on how well one scores in the game.

Fun to play but probably not a buy.  After all, do I really need another long complicated game that does this resource conversion exercise that ideally requires me to spend time playing it and learning it?  I already have Le Havre and Ora et Labora - do I need another?  Besides, I may be getting a little tired of it.  If I'm going to invest multiple plays into a game, I think I'd prefer something else.

I obviously like Rosenberg. Caverna is obvouisly a good game. But I'm a Agricola guy. Caverna is too much open information for me and I need my cards. I also am not a fan of the crusader concept (or how it's called in English).

Still, 8 points is a lot. I would not hesitate to play Caverna. But Agricola with some of the base cards set is just more fun for me.

I didn't want to play this.  But the company was congenial, and time was on hand.  So I agreed.  And as we played, I felt all desire to ever play Agricola ebb away.

I won't describe the game, others have done so better than I will.  My hesitations around this game include:

size - this is a sprawling game with lots of components.

duration - this is a game that will take longer to play than Agricola.

acceptance - all my usual opponents are burnt out on Agricola.  If I buy it will we play it?

Two weeks later... Ordered

I've now played 6 times.  This is a very enjoyable game.  I like it in the same way I enjoy the late double actions in Agricola.  The game feels rewarding, as you really do feel like you are progressing.  In comparison, Agricola often feels like it is nearly impossible to progress.  So Caverna feels easier.

I like this so much better than Agricola.  By simply allowing users to convert food at any time instead of needing an oven etc., it completely removed the unending pain of not accomplishing strategic or meaningful turns in place of just taking food to squeak by.

The lack of variety by not having the cards is not an issue for me because A. I don't play often enough to come up with a single dominate strategy and B. almost all buildings there is only a single copy of so even with a perfect strategy someone else can take the building you need.  It is a big step forward and refreshing look at Agricola.  I will always keep both though.

Feels different than Agricola and everyone can develop their own strategy and board. There are almost too many choices, tons of tiles and each action space does 2 things. It isn't as easy to explain to people that Agricola since they do multiple things. Want fences, place a worker on the fences space. Caverna - want fences, get sheep and build fences or get donkeys and get fences. Love the game though.

Gran juego. Es una variación del Agrícola, aunque para mí el Agrícola sigue siendo mejor. La primera vez que juegas es un pco abrumador, pues tienes desde el principio todos los edificios disponibles y es muy dificil dilucir cuáles son los más convenientes.
Le veo menos rejugabilidad que al Agrícola, precisamente por tener todos los edificios disponibles desde el principio y no en forma de cartas.

This is in my opinion "Agricola 2" as the game play is nearly the same. Although it is still as exciting as Agricola, after a number of games, I started seeing my plays tend to stay in the same approach more or less. However, it is still possible to try completely different way of scoring and that makes this game very fun to play.

RATING: 6
A quite pleasant family game. My experience is based on a 2-player game. 

For a 2-player game Caverna has far too many options, not in the sense that it becomes complex, because it isn't. I haven't played Agricola, but would anyway say that Caverna is a quite straight forward easy game. The problem with the amount of options is that it becomes an activity with little interaction, something that probably improves in a 4-player game, even though I doubt it dramatically changes the game.

I went into the game assuming that not feeding your dwarfs is a bad thing, with sever consequences. Not quite true, since my opponent, who have played the game several times, chose to accept several turns of starving dwarfs to gain huge extra points for something else. His tactic proved successful, even though having piled up several minus tokens. I refuse to say the game is flawed, but the theme becomes irrelevant.

Caverna is a nice activity of figuring out and testing a huge number of combinations. Hence I will probably enjoy several more plays. If I'm looking for a gaming experience I will however choose something else.

If you play Caverna with the races expansion,
https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1623307/fan-expansion-race-packs
it's one of the best games out there. The races give you what you're good at and what you are not so good at. Then, you just try to be the best farmer, The best cave builder or whatever. 

There are so many strategies in this game, and there are so many interesting choices. I love planning what I shell do throughout the game, and I love planning how to do it as efficently as possible through each round.

Fun game, and an interesting variant on Agricola. However, I prefer Agricola still. With Caverna, I have to keep in mind 48 different cavern rooms plus a couple of dozen different actions (many offering multiple choices). That's too many different variables all at once for my taste. In Agricola, if you use the decks, you'll have 14 cards in hand plus 10 major improvements plus a slightly smaller and simpler action board.

Agricola's decks offer more replayability, too, as well as shaking up your strategy each time.

On the other hand, Rosenberg has made the game components a bit more efficient and clear. That, plus Caverna's less punishing mechanisms, make Caverna a good choice for those who find Agricola too dense and too tense.

RATING: 8.5
Настоящая "игра для игроков" от Уве Розенберга. Во многом повторяет Agricola и Le Havre, но при этом достаточно уникальна, чтобы быть самостоятельной игрой с собственным "послевкусием". Интересный баланс между мирной экономикой и экспедициями вооружённых гномов. У игры довольно высокий порог вхождения из-за огромного числа зданий, доступных с самого начала. 

Странен и непонятен эксперимент с большим кол-вом игроков (1-7!). 7-й  игрок точно лишний (ходы станут неоправданно длинными). 6-й - под большим вопросом, так как на нём уже перестаёт хватать компонентов и даунтайм ощутимый. В идеале коробка должна была быть 1-5.

Agricola, the next generation. Intriguing. The familiar mechanisms blended with a new subsystem and without the cards. Heavier. Much heavier. Don't forget the rubies and the additional resources they trigger. Practically no variability, but still many different ways to expand your farm and cave. Average playing time of 1 hour per player. Would avoid with 7 players.

You know the drill: get stuff, convert it into other kinds of stuff to get more stuff and points. Caverna is very similar to Uwe's other newer games, so if you've played any of those, you know beforehand if you are going to like this one or not.

RATING: 8
Take Agricola. Add a billion meeples. Add four dozen tiles. Add more action squares. Park your friends in front of it and watch their eyes glaze over.

Departs from Agricola's reasonable gateway-friendliness by turning the strategy (and some of the AP) up a notch, but still a fun, thematic game if you have people who have the patience and like a sense of building something at the end of the game. More like Agricola^2 (squared) than Agricola 2.0 .

RATING: 7
Good game with lots of complexity but you need to have a lot of time available to play this one. Takes a little while to be comfortable with all the different buildings and strategies so first couple of plays can be a bit tough. Game is best with two/three players and can otherwise become a bit long for my taste. Due to the length of the game it does't hit the table really often and drops the rating of the game for me personally.

Caverna is, as many people have called it, Agricola 2.0 and for good reasons. It fixes many issues with Agricola, the most glaring being the food scarcity. Additions to Caverna also made the game more palatable such as the dwarf quests, the better selection of enhancement cards and the rubies/coal aspect. While the game play is nearly Identical to Agricola, there are some minor changes. The game will take a solid 2 hours for 3 people. 20 minutes simply being the setup. 

I knocked it a half point simply for the sheer volume of the game. Im guessing it weighs about 10lbs in the box and there are so many pieces you are bound to drop some or lose some no matter how hard you try. 

Overall I would recommend this game ONLY if you have played Agricola a few times to get the style of playing down, then move onto Caverna.

I might have to give this a 7 and downgrade agricola to a 7 as well.
For this type of game it is an excellent game.
However this very much feels like a puzzle solving game.
I didn't experience this in Agricola. Perhaps it has to do with the fact that Caverna is more open. And I mostly played agricola as a family game.

Now in most games trying to play efficiently doesn't feel like a puzzle. This one did.
Some people will love the fact that it feels like a puzzle, To me it detracts from the score.

I still have to play a couple of more of Uwe's games. I think he is a great designer and while I thought I would like each of his games released the last ten years I am not sure anymore.

Not really my type of game, Caverna requires a lot of setup/cleanup and a LOT of explanation to new players.  It's often compared to Agricola, having the disadvantages of taking a long time to play, and requiring multiple plays to begin to get any sense of strategy.  That said, this is a well designed game of its type, with interesting mechanisms and lots of options.  Not sure how much replayability it has, since I've played only twice.  But it doesn't seem that the game options change very much from one game to another.

I was very reluctant to believe the hype - Agricola is one of my all time favorites - but this one deserves its accolades. It's different from its predecessor in being much less tense, but while I love the tension in A the freedom that this one offers more than makes up for it. I find myself thinking about alternate strategies a lot. Must play for any fan of the original.

Wow! Probably the best game I have played. Totally replaces Agricola for me because in Caverna it is easier to try out completely different strategies whereas in Agricola everyone seems to end with the same result but just does it in a different order. Caverna offers so many options but it doesn't feel too heavy (although at first sight the hundreds of components might scare you off). Also, component quality is great.

Negatives:
- Setup and boxing take a lot of time.
- Difficult to read all the small tiles if you're sitting on the other end of the table. Need to print out leaflets covering all the tiles in play.
- Takes a lot of room on the table

It's Agricola with couple of different kind of twists. It's definitely not my kind of game because it has low of interaction ("because I took this action, others can't choose it on this round" - isn't enough), it is longer than it should be AND because it's huge point-salad game where you get points for everything you do pe develope. These issues mixed together and you have here a massive amount of different kind of components but still it feels almost the same tham Agricola. I'm also a bit woriried about replaybility of Caverna - because all the cards, rooms etc. are always in game - but luckily I don't need to find out if that's an real issue or not.

Caverna: The Cave Farmers is a worker-placement game at heart, with a focus on farming. In the game, you are the bearded leader of a small dwarf family that lives in a little cave in the mountains. You begin the game with a farmer and his spouse, and each member of the farming family represents an action that the player can take each turn. Together, you cultivate the forest in front of your cave and dig deeper into the mountain. You furnish the caves as dwellings for your offspring as well as working spaces for small enterprises.

RATING: 6.8
Uwe "Frankenstein" Rosenberg's monster is, just as I expected, a perfectly well-developed, complex game with even more colorful ways, many strategies to win... and too little to make me want to explore it more.
First of all, this is Agricola meets the buildings (available for everyone from the beginning) from Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small with the addition that this time you can upgrade... wait for it... your workers, to 14 different levels - the more the levels, the more different kinds of actions you can choose from to take with them using certain action spaces. And there are rubies, rubies that would be called 'gold' in other games as they are just kind of wild resources and can be used also more than a dozen ways (mostly overlapping with those of a level 14 worker).
This is what the game offers and if I felt I didn't get enough novelty in Ora et Labora, I really feel it now. for a game that takes one hour to explain and 2 to 4 hours to play I need more novelty or more fun to feel that the time and effort spent was worth it. I can play Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small 5 or more times during one play of Caverna and I would rather do that. Still, of course it's a game perfectly suited for very high BGG rankings; I just feel I don't like most of the changes much.
+: the game is colorful
-: the theme makes less sense here
-: rubies (1 to x extra actions to be chosen of about 20) and dwarves (1 to 4 actions to be chosen of about the same) make downtime and eventually the game itself longer
-: strategic paths seem to be a lot more scripted, forced (yes, I know, it's just an opinion after one play)
-: as food is less scarce because there are millions of ways to make food, tension is also lower

More balanced than Agricola, but less replay value as the furnishings never change. Otherwise the same game. 

I dislike how players are split up between warriors/peaceful, really decreasing the tension of "blocking" choices. The imitation action further decreases the tension of player interaction.

All-in-all a more-balanced, easier alternative to Agricola with less replay-value.

Hopefully a future expansion will add new furnishings and perhaps an occupation system.

Played five time so far.  This game is so fun, there are so many strategy options and paths to take.  Only played two player games so far, it will be interesting to see how this plays with 4 or 5. Bought a wood insert for this one, really cuts down on the set up and break down time.  May have to buck up for one for Mage Knight as well.

This is really a remake of Agricola+FotM but streamlined and more balanced.  I like that there are no role cards (many of which were broken in Agricola anyway) and that it's friendlier to a diversity of strategy (you can win without family growth being a main focus).  It's still somewhat long and involved, so it can be a bit frustrating with the improved balance sometimes making for fluky fringe wins.  Always having the same buildings available for building is sort of a downer, and having to read/know all those buildings is rather annoying (which is a problem shared by Le Havre and Ora Labora).  Overall a great game which I would say is only slightly more playable than Agricola.

RATING: 8
This version of Agricola is a bit more open allowing for more specialization and probably even pushes you that direction.  Food doesn't feel quite as tight despite having to feed quite often in the game and the 7 unknown harvest/feeding chits can be rather frustrating when they come up in the wrong order for you...;-)  

Instead of cards being used to provide variation, the rooms provide unique actions and abilities of which most there are only one of each except for the base dwelling.  Adventuring is an interesting addition to the game as well which allows a person to go off and pillage stuff which is often better as you improve your weaponry.  Frankly, this is the part of the game that really gets me interested in playing as it is really unique from the other "Agricolas".  

It does not feel nearly as vicious as the original, but I find it quite interesting and enjoyable.  I don't believe I would still ever play with more than 5...and possibly not more than 4 just to avoid downtime.  

Four player makes for a much tighter game than three player thus far in my brief experience.  Imitation was used far more often in the four player game.

Agricola sugulane, aga siiski temast piisavalt erinev. Caverna on kindlasti mängija vastu palju lahkem, kui Agricola. Enam ei ole pere toitmine nii suur mure ja jääb ka aega mõelda, kuidas ma võimalikut palju nodi kokku ajan. Oma koopa ehitamises on midagi nii nauditavat. Kas ma ehitan siia rubiini kaevanduse, laoruumi või hoopis magamistoa? Põlluharimine, loomakasvatus või seiklused? Eeslid,lambad,koerad või sead? Ja nüüd on mul järsku jälle suur tuhin Cavernat mängida.

A large but tight box of beautiful components. Scaling it up to 7 players was unnecessary as the game would take too long to finish and number of components becomes larger. A first time player will be overwhelmed by the number of options. Grasping the plethora of actions and rooms that extend your cave requires a few completed games. The nice thing is that you can score points by concentrating on only a few things and do not have to study all the buildings in your first game. The game requires a custom insert to make setup bearable. Despite the negative aspects Caverna delivers fun 2 hours of exploring, farming and raising animals in a sandbox. The game is a solitaire as player interaction is limited to blocking actions from competitors. This does not feel mean in any sense. The most enjoyment in this game comes from building engines and feeling proud of your fields and farm animals. End game scoring has not been made the culmination point.

Tedious and boring game. Feels like a solo game even with 4 people at the table. Inevitably leads to analysis paralysis even from players who aren't normally prone to doing so.

Secret Santa 2014. This is one of these games that fall into a category I like, but I don't love - those on which part of the game complexity comes from adding things that alter the game for those who get it (in this case, "furnishing" your cavern with tiles) but are just too many in order to memorize them all (meaning that every time one gets the furnish action there is a good dose of AP in order to look at all the tiles and choosing one). I never played it with a high number of players (it accepts up to seven), as it already worries me that, even with three players, this easily goes up to four hours if we include rules explanation, setting it up and then organizing everything on the box again (it is a huge number of components, which I organize with a big plano box, a small one, and also a few plastic bags).

Similar feeling as Agricola:
- Quick turns (1 action)
- Similar breeding, feeding, harvesting, begging,…
- Relatively simple rules (essentially the same as Agricola's)

Missing compared to Agricola:

- Variety brought about by the cards. They let you be somewhat creative, let you be "special" in a way that you have never experienced or seen before, in a way that may not be available in many of your future games.

Added compared to Agricola:

- The ability to specialize, thanks to buyable end-of-game bonuses (specialize in ore, etc.). Now, this makes the game also closer to many other euro games (like Terra Mystica, maybe), so this is also a negative. There is always the risk that you specialization is not as good as some other one, but you need to play the game many times before discovering it (unless it is well balanced, and execution is what is rewarded, more than choice).

- The ability to be able to keep building something, thanks to more actions being available, doing a wider variety of things: Expeditions, converting woods to meadows, digging tunnels, getting dogs for guarding the sheep, etc.

* Overall: a nice game, that I would be happy to own, but that I don't feel the need to, because I have Agricola. Also, I really like the "simplicity" of Agricola: having to have a bit of everything makes part of the strategy "obvious", which leaves less chance to luck, compared to a game where some basic strategies must be taken, despite the fact that they can be quite invisible to new players (like taking many improvements in Caverna, or whatever in Puerto Rico).

Das etwas MEHR von Agricola.
Caverna spielt sich im Grunde wie Agricola. Jede Runde kommt eine weitere Aktionsmöglichkeit hinzu, jede Runde häufen sich Ressourcen und Tiere auf den Aktionsfeldern an und jede Runde setzen wir unsere - Anfangs 2 - Familienmitglieder ein.
Der Unterschied zu Agricola ist zum Großteil:
1. Die Aktionsfelder geben mehr Aktionen auf einmal, so kann man Ressourcen sammeln und noch ein Feld pflügen (o.Ä.), man kann seine Arbeiter mit Waffen aufwerten und auf Streifzüge gehen, was viel bringt und es gibt ein wenig mehr Tierarten und deren Haltung ist auch "leichter", aber thematisch, sowie logisch nachvollziehbar und man braucht nicht in den Regeln nachzusehen, dass Hunde Schaafe auf der Wiese hüten können und Wildschweine im Wald, sowie Esel in den Mienen untergebracht werden dürfen.
Das Spiel finde ich super, aber auch zu ähnlich zu Agricola. Mechanisch ist es das bessere Spiel wie ich finde, aber mir ist es ein Tick zu viel, vielleicht aber nur, weil ich Agricola so gut kenne.
Ich würde es gerne nochmals spielen, wenn es nicht vorher verkauft ist, denn es ist bereits auf die Verkaufsliste gesetzt...

Agricola in the Stone Age This stand-alone edition of Agricola takes place in prehistoric times. You chop out caves and furnish them, while you chop down trees and keep animals. In the meantime you collect all kinds of raw materials and gems to be able to fund your actions. Choose each turn an action with your cavemen and develop your caves into luxury living space and make your garden self-sufficient. Collect rubies to perform special actions and keep donkeys in the caves Dogs keep your flock under control. Do you have the most valuable cave at the end of the game ?! Agricola players will encounter familiar and new game mechanisms, but especially the experience of Caverna is fundamentally different. Because there are far fewer playing cards in the game, the advanced version of Caverna is also more accessible for beginning players. nice if you are a real rosenberg fan

I love this game.  Amazing worker-placement, and I can get most anyone to play it.  Very thematic, tangible, spacial, everyone likes building out their mine and farm.  I could go on and on but everyone else's reviews already shows that it's amazing.

The downside that most don't mention is that it is huge.  Even if you're playing for 1-2 players, it takes up a full kitchen table basically.  And I mean FULL.  So there is a lot of reaching around, and it takes a while just to get all the pieces ordered well.  At least all the pieces are in different bags but I don't like pulling pieces out of bags.  I'm going to get some plano boxes to make that part a lot better.

The other big problem is that the game is just long.  Longer than what it says.  And if you are trying to teach a game to someone who doesn't catch on quick and thinks about their turn alot--so help you God.  I had a 6 hour game because of one such person.  This game takes 1-2 hrs per person.  I don't think I'll ever get it down to 1 hr per person, but I imagine some people might.  

With that being said, if you're planning on it taking that long and you set aside a Saturday for it, then it's not necessarily bad.  What I'm saying is, it doesn't feel like a game that "outstays its welcome."  Maybe it does just a little bit...but it is quite an epic game, and no part of it feels wasted, like "why do we have to do this stage of the game?"  

In short: don't play more than a 3 player game if one person is a noob or ap.

I guess player interaction could be better.  It feels like you are playing a solitaire game with your personal board.  But there is player interaction with what actions are taken...then other people can't take them.  So I would rate the player interaction as moderately good.

Building your own farm and mining system with so many options available. Lovely pieces. The only thing that worries me is the static setup every time. I'm afraid me or my playmates will choose the same strategy over and over. But i really love the harvesting, feeding, mining, so would definitely recommend it. Quite a big price for the game, knowing it's that big just to play it with seven players, and we mostly play with 2 players.

A very relaxing iteration of Agricola that is very enjoyable, satisfying and beg to be played more and more.

Its certainly "wider" than Agricola yet a bit "shallower".
Its far less unforgiving and hence allows the players to enjoy the game in a rather fresh and breezy fashion.

Whether or not you win or lose, the game itself would be very satisfying at the end when you look at your accomplishment of a farm.

I really like this game much more than Agricola.

The one point that i think this game could suffer is the fact that all the room tiles are laid bare before all. This would allow the game to be "fair" without some people knowing all the cards and combo by reading and studying them before the game. However, such non-random approach to the game could lead to the game being more of a "multiple solitaire" game and limit replayability. 

I supposed its not a serious issue that some smart variants and house rules cannot fix.

Another thing i really love about the game is that while the game can be a real brain-burner, it doesn't feel like that while you are playing the game. It feels fresh, breezy and relaxing throughout. The somewhat soften sense of urgency surely is to be credited for the phenomena.

Many say that Caverna eliminates the need for Agricola. I respectfully disagree.  They each have their rightful place on the game shelf.  Like Agricola, this has farming (which I love) and wonderful components.  It's more forgiving, in that there are more ways to both feed your family and collect points. In that way it may be more fun than Agricola but slightly less challenging.  Also, it takes up much more time and space. 

Living in a state that has winter about 5 months out of the year, it is nice to have a big "snow day" game like Caverna.  Just don't spill hot chocolate on the cards. 

The only reason this game gets an 8 instead of a 10 for me is because of the time commitment.  You can't just whip out Caverna on a whim (unless you're snowed in).

RATING: 7
I would say I enjoy this more than Agricola but not as much a Le Havre which is for me the best in this series.  The components are gorgeous and production value is top notch.  However, this game did not evoke much of a thematic experience for me as I was hoping.  For example, all the animals are essentially the same except dogs can watch over sheep and donkeys can work in the mines.  I would rather it be more thematic with being able to focus on different animals to produce goods.  The game forces you to focus on a bit of everything rather than specializing.  What if I just really wanted to be a sheep herder and be the best damn sheep herder ever?  Nope, still going to get negative points and only 2 or 3 buildings to really support this play-style.  Someone who diversifies will most likely out score you.

I like games where I can have a specialize in a certain aspect of the game and follow a specific strategy.  Agricola actually lends more to that playstyle with the cards you start with.  In Caverna, everyone starts out essentially the same and everyone is encourage to do the same stuff.

For most of the game I didn't care what anyone else was doing as long as they didn't take my spot or didn't buy my buildings. We were all doing pretty much the same stuff so it didn't really matter.

For me this is like Agricola only it has more freedom like you'd find in many resource conversion games such as Homesteaders. That's a double edged sword because as much as the system opens up it also takes away the uniqueness.

This game is certainly one big pond to swim in. I'm sure some Gric purists will poo-poo this game, perhaps others will simply be tired of the genre, however for anyone like me that still enjoys a cube churner with lots of flavor and freedom, then this game will hit all the right notes.

Tramite dei token da posizionare sulle caselle si possono compiere diverse azioni come costruire nella caverna, coltivare i campi, eseguire le spedizioni.
Le pecche a mio avviso risultano essere la difficoltà nel riuscire a fare quel che si vuole quando si gioca in più di 3 persone (le caselle sono ad uso singolo ogni turno) e la evidente superiorità nell'adottare la strategia delle spedizioni che paga praticamente più di ogni altra cosa.

This is the biggest heaviest most ambitious motherf... of a game! 
All punched and bagged, the material fills the big box to the brim - nothing but postcard expansions can be added!

Is it any good? Sure, if you love Agricola, you will love this one too. 
Its not /quite/ as good as Agricola, and it lacks entrance level play (ie. there's no family version included).
But since Agricola is the best game I've ever played, this one still outranks most others.

Raised to 10. I really enjoy not holding 14 confusing cards and I like that I can more predictably design and follow a strategy before starting play. It's also great that there is no limit to how much you can score in each category.

Raised to 11, no wait ...

Similar to Acricola in all basic mechanichs but more streamlined and not really as heavy. Main difference is that occupations and minor improvments are not dealed from a separate deck but those bonuses instead exists as buildnings that you compete to buy for resourses. 

I makes Caverna more open, maybe with less randomness but I still cant say which one I prefere. Both are really good games.

Yes. All the best bits of Agricola, plus a bunch of cool new stuff, most notably a more open game that allows for a variety of strategies. To make room, Uwe Rosenberg has streamlined some of the elements of Agricola that players found more frustrating. Long set-up time and play time make this a game that I can't play as often as I'd like, but even with minimal play, it's apparent that this is a game that is at least as good as Agricola, which is a game I know well.

While I can see why this well-crafted game rates so highly on BGG, I must say I find it a little boring. Mostly it's the agriculture part. The caverns, however, offer what I consider more interesting game play.

Update: Having played a few times with the wife now I've come to appreciate it more. Still, there's something about it that annoys me. Maybe I just haven't figured out any solid strategies yet.

This game is fantastic. It is relaxing and non confrontational. Played with 4 and 2. I was hesitant at first, price is hefty but I was able to buy it and I do not regret this at all. It is so enjoyable and relaxing as you develop your people and work on your farm and or caves. You are always faced with tough decisions, and will sometimes be left wondering if you will be able to feed your people. My wife was upset when I told her I spent 115 on this that is us money. But it is her favorite game we own now. I bought the broken token organizer it is a godsend buy both you will be thankful.

Before playing Caverna, I viewed it as being another Agricola clone. However, after playing the game twice, my perspective changed. In fact, I added it to my wish list and put Agricola on my trade list.

In many ways, Caverna is more forgiving and approachable than Agricola. I liked that. It also got rid of the random distribution of cards, which in Agricola can heavily tilt the game toward a player if they got great occupation cards or cards than synergized very well. In place, there are now room tiles that are available to all players from the very beginning of the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Beats original Agricola by miles right out of the box. It's more open than Agricola by far, which is probably why I like it. It's much easier to adopt a strategy to challenge an opponent, so it doesn't seem as prone to runaway victories. Replayability is not as high as Agricola though, because there are only a few buildings, even at higher player counts so they don't change much.

Agricola XXL. But who was waiting for this? 

This game uses some of the good ideas in [thing=119890][/thing], and applies them to [thing=31260][/thing]. 
And then I wonder who was the twisted mind that made this to be a game for 7 players. Playing this game feels like Snowwhite and the 6 sleeping dwarfs.

Very high down time (especially when playing with more than 4), and very solitary game experience. 

I really don't understand why, this game was created, after [thing=31260][/thing]. Seems like a waste of energy and resources.

If you like this game, that's fine, but please, stay out of my neighborhood.

An excellent advance on Agricola, replacing occupations and minor improvements with a set collection of rooms.  This game seems more forgiving than Agricola and with the mining appeals more thematically to my family.  The art and design of the pieces and board are superb and worth the investment.  

Adventures/quests seem less thematic and have continued a non-spatial action in Uwe Rosenberg's work.  I'm not quite sure what I think of that.  Every action usually has a spatial representation:  build fences builds fences.  But the questing takes the worker/player "off the board" in a way that the original "collect any resource" kind of action from Agricola did not.  At least in that situation you could imagine, as the iOS port of Agricola does, that there is a market stall or basket of goods for you to collect and then put in your supply.  

Our kids have come to call adventures "shopping" and I think the flavor text in the rulebook that describes what a dwarf does on each quest, for instance, finding an abandoned baby animal, fits very well with the game itself.  

But something's not quite right for me.

Edit:  many geeks worry about re-playability.  I don't share that worry, though I'm not sure why.

Yes, it's more open than Agricola.  Yes, it's less punishing.  Yes, there is zero variable setup.  You know what?  I don't care.  It's fun to play to try out the variety of strategies and see how you can out-do that "certain" strategy someone else always plays.  If that's how some people like playing (same strategy) more power to them.  This game gives both groups of people something to play with.

Tied with Agricola, for now.

It has a lot of different ways to think, and there's also an Ora et Labora feel because some tiles are worth VPs.

This is a VERY good game.

For me, it has 2 drawbacks:

1 - The huge amount of tiles in the game, which can lead to some serious AP; and

2 - All the tiles are available in every game, so the lack of variability can lead to some prefixed openings and strategies. Too much play can get this game boring and steepen the learning curve to the newbies.

It's not a game I clamour to play every night but when I do I really enjoy it. We all seemed to head off with our dwarfs on our own merry ways, some sticking to mining, some producing enough food from farming to keep Lidl in supply, others kept sheep and slept with them secretly in their caves at night while the more outgoing ones manipulated ore and armed themselves and headed out on wild adventures and came back with foreign marvels in the form of a pumpkin and a cow.

Some good and some bad compared to Agricola. The weapons are a nice touche, upgrading workers gives an interesting tradeoff vs getting more workers.

Caverna has an intimidatingly heavy box, lengthy rulebook, and number of components, but the actual game is involved without being complex, surprisingly easy to learn and teach, and intuitive to play. I love it.

It's full of charming little touches, like being able to eat your dog but not getting any food from it, dogs wandering around the farm, the Cuddle Room for snuggling with sheep (or "snuggling," if you like), "wishing" for children, and just the whole notion of happy dwarves farming, mining, furnishing their caverns, and going on little adventures. It's a fantastic mishmash.

I can't imagine trying to play this without the Broken Token inserts. They make it a breeze to play straight out of the trays, and tear down right back into the trays, and transform a huge heap of components into pure delight. And those components! The little vegemeeples and animals are adorable. And that rulebook! Huge, but easy to navigate, full of examples, and a joy to reference in play.

The game is meaty without being dense. Needing to feed your family is stressful, although I suspect another play or two will make it second nature, but nothing else in the game has that edge. It's pleasant without being bland or boring. And the meat is excellent, with many paths to victory, every action being useful, a limited number of turns, and no possible way to do it all.

After just one play, I don't think I'd need to reference the rulebook more than occasionally during a second play. Caverna is sublime.

Very good game. Pretty 'friendly' for Uwe's games.  Rating has gone up and down.  The design and flow are great, but after enough games I am seeing some drop in replay value. Just feels like I don't have near the number of game paths as in Agricola.  I would love to see a merging of the two - more replayable Caverna, less tight Agricola.  I have a lot of games so that is a tough order to fill.

My great grandfather was a farmer, so was my grandfather and my father. Also my brother, and soon my nephew. I've lived on a farm for 20 years. I think it's boring. The sowing is dusty and makes me cough. The harvest phase makes me tired and my muscles ache. I liked taking care of the cows, though.

So I finally got to play Caverna! How was it? REALLY good! I've now played Agricola, Le Havre and Caverna, and the latter is far and away the best. That says a lot, because I like Le Havre quite a bit. 

More interesting though is the argument as to whether you should play/buy Agricola or Caverna. No question--you should find a way to get your hands on Caverna. Different strokes, I guess, but I almost feel that Caverna is *unquestionably* the better game. It takes everything good about Agricola (theme, interesting choices, excellent game design, etc. and adds interaction (tiles), more options (adventuring) and less restrictions on end-game bonuses. 

Overall: An excellent game that works really well with 2

Caverna feels more adventurous and laid back than Agricola, and i do like this scoring method that allows you to specialize in something, and doesn't force you to do a little bit of everything...However, it's that lack of tension that makes Caverna less exciting. Long live Agricola.

Likely ends up an 8 in terms of quality, but its biggest crime is that I have played it before due to other worker placement games and Agricola specifically.

Fun sandbox game that has numerous paths to victory.  Sometimes it's nice to just try a new room or a new setup.  I can see replayability declining as time goes on due to lack of variable setup.

Update 1/25/16.  Rating lowered from 8 to 7.  Haven't played in a while.  There just isn't a lot of replayability once you explore the different strategies (adventuring, animals, crops, rubies).  Since the need to feed isn't as strong, there isn't a lot of tension.  I feel like Agricola has this beat.

I prefer Agricola but this is one of my favorite heavy games too.
Caverna is less stressful (feeding-wise) and more open, but way more complex version of Agricola. It's deep but not dry, bit like Farmers of Moor 2.0 that completely gets rid of cards (Fotm had possibility to play with Improvements, which I personally haven't even tried yet(!)). Dwarves make the game more light-hearted. Takes ages to setup and is a pain to learn even if you've played Agricola, but I guess on some level it's worth it, yes. This is a game I probably won't play more than once a year (if even that!) but will probably enjoy it every time. But I must say that this game might also be the end of my Uwe Rosenberg fandom. I like the way he brought actual stories into heavier, victory point hoarding games, but if this complexity level is the direction he's going to, I won't follow.

It's hard to give this game a 9, which would be the minimum rating I'd give to a game I'd recommend purchasing.  I do like the game a lot.  Compared to Agricola, I think it's way easier to introduce this to new players and new gamers. 
 I love that there are a variety of ways to play it.  You can enjoy this game while still coming in last.  The components are fantastic, and there's a ton of stuff in the box.  I am glad I purchased it for $60, which is the most I'd pay for this, but I won't really say I'd buy it today because it just doesn't get played much.  There's no sense in buying games that don't get played enough to justify their cost.

RATING: 10
This is far and away my favorite game!  When you open the box it can be a bit overwhelming, but once you play your first game you will be hooked.  There is deep strategy, a great theme, world building, and a million options to consider on each turn.  

Each player starts with a game board where half is a forest and half is a cave.  Both sides are unexplored and undeveloped.  You then take turns sending your workers out to perform tasks that allow you to turn your forest and cave into farmlands, mines, or rooms.  Each choice you make slowly develops your board and opens new options for creativity.  By the end of the game you have pastures full of animals, mines with donkeys hauling ore, and bedrooms full of more workers to send out.  Players compete for tasks, as each task can only be chosen by one worker per round (some exceptions exist).  So if you wanted to build a pasture, but your friend got there first, too bad!  But there are a ton of things to do, and strategies to try, so it's fun to experiment and change things as you go.  At the end, each player tallies up their scores based on their personal development, and a winner is chosen.  I can't recommend this game enough.  It takes some time to learn, and it is certainly not a fast game, but if you enjoy worker placement games and have 2-4 hours free, it's a great choice.  

Honestly, just typing this right now makes me want to leave work and play this game!

Great game. Gets compared to Agricola a lot but I fail to see why besides designer/theme crossover. They play very differently. In Agricola you have cards that change your approach every game, there is skill in adapting to the cards and picking a winning strategy. In Caverna the options are laid out for everyone and it's more of a race to pick what you want with the same options available every game. That makes it less interesting as a game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
The prospect of a heavy euro game can be daunting (especially when you see the size of this box and contents) but Caverna at it's heart is pretty simple to play. Simplicity doesn't mean it's dull though, there is a crazy amount you can do in the game and there is no single optimal path to victory. It looks great and plays great with 2-4 players, the box says it goes up to 7 but that would probably slow it down too much.

It took a while for me to get used to 'workerplacement' games, but it happened. I really like this game, I love the theme and the overall attention that is given to the game by the designers, etc. In my opinion much better than Agricola, because there are more choices (you're not restricted by a limited amount of cards, look of the farm and having a hard time getting the food requirements). However, that also makes it more difficult and requires multiple plays to get to know all the different roads to victory (choice is a hard thing).

My wife likes the game, but it's a bit on the long side for her. She said she'll get to know the game in time. :)

Love this game! It is not as brain-burny or as unforgiving as Agricola, but it still plays with a bit of tension. You need to plan what tiles and strategies work well and have to have a plan B and C in case you get bumped out of needed spots. (It is relatively easy to have an alternative plan.) As always, I love games where you have to build your little "dwarvendom". Just a supremely excellent game with so much wood! A couple of caveats, this must have a storage system (playing pieces out of baggies is a drag) and do not play with more than 5 (or it goes on way to long).

It's kind of funny that I have 6 plays of this, and yet I am still unsure of how I feel about the game.  I definitely don't think it replaces Agricola as the tension just isn't nearly as high.  There is plenty of room for exploration, but is the game interesting enough for me to want to really explore?  This game initially had a higher rating, but I've cooled on it quite a bit...

I generally don't like games with non-random setups and a fuck ton of buildings that you need to either memorize or reference a spreadsheet to determine their associated costs/perks/etc.  In other words, I don't like popular games such as Puerto Rico, Ora et Labora, Homesteaders, etc. That said, Caverna is the least annoying of such games, as gameplay is smooth and not having memorized all of the buildings seems less penalizing than in those other games. Also, moves feel a bit less scripted due to the random order of harvests.

RATING: 7.21
Caverna is a hard game to really pin down for me. I like it and wouldn't veto it if someone wanted to play, but I find I'd suggest it less and less as I play more worker placement games. It almost feels like each action isn't very important by itself, but a series of actions that work together can be rewarding. A game that definitely lends itself more to strategy than tactics.

This game is for me the improved Agricola. It's more streamlined, isn't as punishing, and you actually feel like you have many great choices, especially with arming your dwarves with weapons and sending them on quests. I think that in particular is my favourite part. I like that you don't require special buildings to convert animals or vegetables into food. That part never made sense i Agricola, the fact that you could possibly starve while being in possession of edible resources. While I wish I could still build fences more freely, in every other aspect I think Caverna absolutely outshines Agricola.

An excellent worker placement game that's not as stressful as Agricola but still offers quite a diverse way of playing.

For me, replaces Agricola, as there's not as much luck (no cards dealt, so everybody starts on the same footing) and I can compete. Agricola has a learning curve that I never caught up on. So yeah, basically, Rosenberg streamlined Agricola and added the great quest mechanic that allows you to perform additional actions. You still need to manage your resources and time your moves according to what you feel others may be trying to do.

Spiritual successor to Agricola, it has some of the same feel, but also a lot of changes. It is less stressful for the feeding phases, and is open to multiple strategies. Getting the third dwarf is still very important, but the 4-5th members of the family aren't as important as they are in Agricola. Would love to see a (big-box) expansion for two for this game to help with additional repeatability and variety.

What to say about Caverna? I was shocked to hear it had replaced Agricola for so many fans, which really boosted my interest. After playing it, I'm just as shocked. Caverna shares the round structure and many placement rules with its older brother, but has a totally different feel. Specifically it lacks the tight play and tension that always made Agricola unique to me. This leaves me wondering: if people find Caverna a replacement for Agricola, what did they see in Agricola in the first place? Certainly not what I see. Enumerating and judging the differences between a classic and this bastard child of it and Ora et Labora hardly seems worthwhile, so I'll content myself with a middling score and continue to play the original.

Not really an improvement over Agricola. In fact, I would say it's a few steps back. For a game about farming, it seems mining is far more important. And the planting/harvesting rules make no sense to me. Also, there are too many ways to "break" the rules. It really is too long and boring (especially with five players) for the amount of game there.

This is less like Agricola (which I played later) than I expected from everyone's descriptions.  Would need to play more to get a real feel for the economy - adventuring really sets it apart from Agricola.

This is a solid (also solidly heavy, with tons of wood) update to Agricola. The game is not very different from Agricola, and if you know how to play that, you'll basically know how to play this. I feel like the designer made real improvements and addressed my three chief complaints with the original game, resulting in one of the best hardcore strategy board games I've played.

Problem 1: Intimidatingly complex. I like complex games, but sometimes I didn't want to play Agricola because I just wasn't in the mood to think _that_ hard. Caverna isn't quite so taxing, and I think that's a good thing. It means it will hit the table much more often.

Problem 2: One path to victory. I felt like Agricola had one main path to victory, which was firing on all cylinders and achieving everything perfectly. Caverna has more flexibility and allows you to pursue options that your opponents are not also pursuing.

Problem 3: Requiring perfection. In Agricola, if you made one wrong move, you could be screwed in the later game. The existence of rubies and a more lenient trading schema means that in Caverna, there's some room to learn while you're playing and still be successful.

I bought this game after having seen the reviews and as a big fan of Agricola (a 10!). If you like the challenge and the struggle of Agricola, realize that this game is different. 

Basically, you get agricola with more features and somewhat reworked mechanics. The problem is that I felt NO tension whatsoever. Everyone who desires can fill their board well before the game and resources are in surplus. Not necessarily a bad thing for everyone, but it was for me.

I'm not really sure if this would replace Agricola for me - it seems like you can always do something interesting during your turn, this makes it less tight than regular Agricola. The stress of having to feed your people is taken away which makes the game less enticing for me (based on my only play though) - also the fact that all buildings and actions are available from the beginning, makes the game very AP-prone in comparison to Agricola where everything slowly builds up round after round. This sandbox doesn't appeal to me as much as Agricola where everything slowly builds up.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
I find Agricola mediocre and bland.  I like fantasy themes, and the idea of replacing the random cards with tiles seemed like an improvement to me.

Unfortunately I hate this game far more than Agricola. The artwork on the components does not evoke the feeling of being a dwarf clan. The art feels even more boring than Agricola because at least Agricola had pictures on the cards instead of little boring tiles with furniture on them. While playing the game there are no pictures of dwarves on anything. The rulebook has some buried in there, but all you look at while playing is boring farms, caves, and furniture.  

Aesthetics aren't everything, maybe the gameplay would be worthwhile. No, I hate the gameplay. It is a mess. There are exceptions to rules everywhere. Donkeys in mines, dogs with sheep, and on and on. Couple that with the billion options for what to do every turn and it's overwhelming. I can't hold all that in my head properly while also playing the game against other players. There is going to come a time when somebody wins because nobody got in their way when they where building some combo that everyone else wasn't paying attention to. Having to figure out your best move and take into account the other players is just too large a game space for my brain to comfortably hold.

The thing that put the nail in the coffin for me was the Spare Parts, Trader, and Seam infinite combo. There is an official "fix", but it is inelegant and clunky. There is no reminder that you can't have Trader and Spare Parts except buried in the appendix. So, if I haven't played the game in a while and/or a new playing is playing you could easily end up in a situation where that combo gets rediscovered only to have to say "oh, sorry, you can't do that" and fuck the whole game session up.

In short, bloated convoluted unthematic mess with a band-aided hole.

RATING: 7.1
I had my first and, so far, only play of this new ‘hotness’ with six players (one of who was instructing) at Cancon.  I quite enjoyed the game and found it to be pretty good for what it was. The obvious comparison here is with Ag (both are designed by Uwe) and it is pretty similar but with enough difference for it to be able to stand on its own as its own game.

The premise of the game is that you are dwarfs who have access to both a cavern to mine for resources as well as the great outdoors to cultivate fields and raise livestock. The same system of play as Agricola is in effect as once an action is chosen by one player on other player can choose that action; more possible actions are revealed as play progresses. The difference is that there are two ‘duplicate action space’ where for a two or four food a player can choose to take an already chosen action. The difference here is the possibility for arming your dwarfs and sending them on missions (also on player actions) where they can obtain a variety of resources depending on the type and duration of the mission(s) as well as the quality of weapons they wield. These missions are risk-free in that the adventurer will always return home safely at their completion.

The familiar tension between expansion and being able to feed your dwarfs exists here as well as the requirement for rooms for them to be house in. There is also something of a ‘Soviet style’ mentality to expanding in the cavern in that most of the sorts of rooms one can build are severely limited. For example, there is only one ‘double room” (that can house two additional family members); there are also a limited amount of spaces allowing family growth. I can imagine the local area Commissar forbidding construction of a double room as the region has already met the allowance dictated by the central party and vetoing nay reproductive activity for the same reason.

That aside, C is not a bad little game. One that I would play again but possibly not one that I would buy as it’s too similar to A, which we have with most if not all expansions, for me to be able to justify the purchase. Further play may change my mind and if circumstances were right I would indeed play it again with little hesitation.

When compared to Agricola, this game is definitely more forgiving. You still struggle with time to perform everything you wanted, but you are not completely screwed if someone else took the action you wanted.
The absence of ability cards is somewhat a minus for me (I prefer "play with what you've been given" and Variable Player Powers, rather than everything is fair to everyone), but there are still plenty of paths to victory given by the various rooms.
Will yet have to try this with more than 2 people. Definitely a plus to be support 7 players, although the table would have to be enormous and the players would run from here to there.

Decent euro with excellent components.  Not much player interaction but you kind of should expect that given the designer and box art.  Engine built in a way where you never feel like you are out of the game, which is nice, but may be weak to a point where there will be little point difference separating good strategy from okay strategy.  Have to play more to see if that is the case.  Basically I never felt like I couldn't get away with a few sloppy choices.

A star in my game rotation and a keeper, has  elements of Agricola; Ora et Labora and Agricola All Creatures Big  and Small with some unique twists of its own, like going adventuring.  Like Le Havre, you feel like there is something useful you can do on every turn and seldom feel you lack options and just need to do something in hopes of having better options come along in future turns.  Nice evolution of Agricola which complements all of the variations of that game which have come before.

This is a great heavy but thematic euro with some of the best components I have seen. The game is a bit sandbox which doesn't disturb me, but I play with a variant where you get 3 gold building to increase replayability and strategic focus, when I play with 2p. I love the variable worker placement spots, the medium amount of resource management  and the tile placement for your cave and forest spots. Does feel same to other euros from Uwe, but I love it still.

What can I say that hasn't already been said by better reviewers. This game provides depth and complexity while still feeling balanced. There seem to be several strategies to win. And it doesn't suffer from Agricola's folly of getting a lucky hand of cards that puts you miles ahead of your competitors before the game even starts.

Initial impressions after one play is that I prefer Caverna to Agricola mainly because it just feels more fun and less stress than Agricola. Caverna is more fiddly in terms of the number of rules and options available, though. Like Le Havre, Caverna also feels more of a sandbox than a gruelling efficiency race for the same objective than Agricola. However, in Le Havre there are really just two dominant strategies - shipping or building that both rely on getting steel production up and running as quickly and efficiently as possible. Caverna, at least initially, feels like the scoring options are far more open and therefore a player's strategy seems a bit less dependent on their opponents actions. 

The adventuring rule in Caverna is an interesting innovation but in the end it seems to mainly be just a means for just getting more resources. If there's any agony in Caverna its in the decisions over developing an emergent strategy from the many options available.

Overall, I'd happily play Caverna again. Its a very good game. I still prefer Le Havre because that game offers more player interaction through needing to visit other player's buildings. Like Agricola and Le Havre, be prepared to play for at least 30 minutes per player.

RATING: 7.8
My dislike of the painful feeding and randomness of power card elements of Agricola has driven me towards Caverna. So when offered the chance to play it, I jumped at a 3 player game. The set up does take a while (think Hawaii and then quadruple it!). The power cards are replaced by building tiles - all of which are visible. Your dwarves can either mine or farm OR they can go exploring. I concentrated on mining and exploring which meant that I had little food generation - you would have thought that I would see what was coming next……. there is still some feeding required BUT (and this I really like) you can use your strategy to deal with it. I had a building which enabled dwarves to eat minerals that I had mined! My exploration quests could return with food and animals…. SO there are ways out of the dead-ends of Agricola.
For runtime reasons (30 mins per player) I would not want to play with more than 4 players.

Tades the harsh survivalist nature of its older brother Agricola for a more optimization of victory points found in most contemporary euros. It lacks the tension of Agricola, though is certainly a fun game on its own right, I miss the card drafting, struggle to create a sustainable food engine, and greater impact of each individual point. Fiddly, plays well, but not being as enjoyable as Agricola is its greatest flaw in my opinion.

Gorgeous, laid back & sandboxy. Which is better, this or Agricola? The latter is tighter, but I like the theme and visual style better in Caverna & I enjoy the fact that you can get more done more easily. Agricola is more unforgiving and challenging, but Caverna is more enjoyable when it comes to "being-thereness" and aesthetic flavour & mood. 

The length might be bit of an issue (that's what she said). Also, it's a chore to set up and put away, plus the production desicion to include stuff up to 7 players is just plain stupid, as it's too long even with five. They should have made a separate 6-7 player expansion. There's just too much stuff as it is and it cranks the price up needlessly, especially as the production value is pretty sweet.

Better than Agricola.  What's better you ask?  Elimination of the cards, which are replaced by a tile building pool that everyone has access to, and can compete for.
But why would I get this when Le Havre already does that (building pool that everyone can compete for) but is better, because you can use other people's buildings?
The only thing Caverna does better than Le Havre is support more than 5 players.  But anything over 4 people is still just too long.
That being said, Caverna is a game I wouldn't mind playing again, and prefer over Agricola (I like those warrior dwarves going on quests too, which are critical to win in my opinion), but still don't care to own.

Finally got around to trying this, and I'm not sure what all the fuss is about. This is better than Agricola, but that's like saying the 2nd edition of a game is better than the 1st. This is still very much a convert goods into points kind of game, and just because every good looks like a specialized meeple doesn't make the game any better. This is a fine game if you're in the mood to build something, though there are other Euro games I'd much rather play. I'm actually pretty surprised at how much I don't miss the cards from Agricola though.

RATING: N/A
- Full access to all the upgrades turns this into Analysis-paralysis nightmare. 
- At the same time, it negatively impacts the replay-ability in the long-run. Very little prevents you from going for the same strategy every time.
- Ruthless for the new players. Even for those who played Agricola. The game assumes one will play it multiple times, before starting to enjoy it.
- With the exception of tile timings, it's a complete information game. It's basically chess, except a more convoluted one.
- Too many wildcards for a worker placement. Not many options to actually deny other players.
- Stressful and at the same time long.

+ Credit has to be given for the way the mechanisms are implemented and the amount of play-testing which obviously went into this.
+ Texts on the upgrades and such are simple to understand and don't seem fiddly as was sometimes the case in Agricola.
+ Building your own dwarf settlement is fun.

Great game, but...eh.  It just doesn't have the same magic as Agricola to me, even if it might be a better game overall.

I love the sandbox feel to this game and has high replayability. There are several different strategies to explore. Being able to play solo or as many as 7 players is great, especially different boards depending on the number of players. I greatly enjoy 3+ players the most. The idea is also incredible. The pieces are good quality. My main issue with the game is the pain of setting it up with the many tiles and all the small pieces. Packaging in many plastic bags is quite annoying as well.

I like it more than Agricola at the moment, but that's probably because it feels fresh.

While the game play is like Agricola, it leaves me an impression closer to Le Havre, which is a "stress-free" game in which you actually feel like you have a large amount of options and rooms to make creative plays. 

Agricola is clever but feels scripted. Caverna feel more 'crazy' in that you have like 14 ways of using rubies and getting expedition loot items, with the scoring structure that rewards for specialization, and the simple fact that the board actually gives you good options unlike Agricola. 

This openness make me like this more than Agricola. The only thing in which it migh appear weaker than Agricola is its replayability - but Agricola is like the most replayble ever created anyway, so being less replayable means it is still very playable.

A bit daunting to get into, but once you've learnt the rules, it's remarkably easy and fun to play. I played a friend's copy of Agricola a few times, and could never get wholly into it; Caverna is the improved version of the same game. I love the cave exploration, and the Adventuring mechanic, a way to turn a single action into something much more profitable, is an incredible addition to Agricola's original, formidable design.

Designed by Uwe Rosenberg, this game is very similar to Agricola. You start with two dwarves and place them on spaces to take actions, such as building, gathering grain and vegetables, rubies. Unlike Agricola, there are no cards to choose from, the buildings are all on display for anyone to build. Ore is a resource that can be used to arm your dwarves. Armed dwarves can go adventuring, and take rewards (for instance, gaining cows or other resources). New animals, dogs and donkeys are introduced, and you can also build mines on your display. 

It's a big box game, with many pieces.

There are a lot of things going on, but it is fun. It's similar to Agricola, but the feeding is a bit simpler. There are no ovens and such, you simply convert goods to food. I had fun and look forward to more plays. The sweet spot for the game is probably around 4 players, otherwise it will be too long between turns.

I absolutely loved Agricola, and this is more of the same, with some great tweaks.

I often played the family game of Agricola and love the way the furnishing set-up in this game is similar. It makes it much more accessible for the crowd I played a lot of Agricola Family Game with.

Also delighted that the 4-player "family growth queue", loved by some but for me the main flaw in Agricola at that player count, has been removed.

Really keen to play this some more and get to know it better.

I posted in the Agric and Caverna forums a while debating this but finally took the plunge when I could get this at a good price of $60.44. In my opinion after 3.5 games, this is better than Agricola; Caverna is like a deluxe Agricola! The only possible advantage Agricola has is the variety of cards for replayability, but I personally don't like the cards much since they overload me and are hard to maintain personally.

Here's an example of a possible first turn in 3P Agricola and its comparison in 3P Caverna.

Agicola:
1) Get 1 grain
2) Plow 1 field
VS.
Caverna:
1) Plow a field and get a grain and get 2 food.
2) Plow a 2nd field and sow up the grain.

I like the Caverna version more because each single action will give you multiple things, which lets you build up your farm more. That feels better to me and is more fun to boot. There are still difficult decisions to make like in Agricola, but I never saw much the "fun" of Agricola's feeding stress. The furnishings also feel more thematic to me than the 14 cards in Agricola since you actually place the furnishing into your cavern.

Even though Caverna is 12 rounds versus Agricola's 14, I like that you can do more per action. Every tile is double, so even though Caverna's board is about twice Agricola's, you can fill it up much faster. Your board fills up pretty much all the way and you feel good. You're not forced to do Family Growth to stay competitive, which leaves you open to farming rubies, ore, stone, dwellings, bonus rooms/mines/dwellings/etc, sheep, boar, cattle, donkeys, dogs, veggies, grains, or any combination of the above.

Though there might a marginal bit more maintenance every round compared to Agricola, its still about as quick since its a lot easier to grab the wood, wheat, and other pieces since they're thicker and not round disks.

The lack of the 14 cards hands obviously hurts replayability, but in exchange, you have 24/48 tiles available to build and make your strategy. Admittedly, its actually less tiles per player, but in exchange, you get a more fair situation without lopsided cards. There's also no early pre-game time to draft and pass out the cards, so some extra time is saved there. I have only played 4 games at this point, but I suspect that playing with some variants on the tiles and such will increase this game's replayability (since only the harvest tiles and order of round cards are the things that change sadly). I'm not crazy about using variants, but I do generally agree that the game may get a little old around 15-20 ish plays or so, at least until the expansion comes out.

Despite all the positives said though, I still see some possible improvements to Caverna in my eyes, but I still rate this above Agricola and look forward to more plays. Here are some ways I think it could've been improved still though.

Caverna possible improvements:

- scoring cheat sheet and round order of what comes up cheat card, in addition to the cheat cards of how a harvest works, what a ruby converts to, and the loot charts that are given out.
- instead of alternative artwork of dark caves, put asymmetric backs like in Eclipse or Cuba for variety. I dislike that a lot of tile placements are similar, placing tiles in the direction of food and animals. Having a space to hold resources on your board like in Agricola would be nice too.

Considering trading since lack of variety in setup and also large tablespace and setup time with 48 tiles
- I wish they could've put the singular (1 column) cardboard thing as a piece of the other ones. This is my own nitpick since I like having everything the same size and symmetric. They could also put a bit of text instead of the parenthesis restocking () for when a resource is at 0.
- setup is quite the chore - I suppose a better storage solution or a way to manage the resources better would have helped. Minimizing chits like the harvest tokens would have been nice too.
- I kinda wish they had alternate cards like boar/cattle cards too that you could mix in every so often for different rounds. It would increase the variety.
- I wish they could've added some playtested variants, like rotating the tiles or having extra cards to sub in.
- wish the weapon tiles were Level 1&2 front and back, 3&4 etc, which would make it easier to manage. That may also make it confusing if you flip one by accident, but that should not affect the game too, too much. An alternative is using D20s as the dwarves, though you would need about 35 D20s then and would have to be careful about tipping them over.
- wish the table footprint wasn't as large. Given how much space it needs, I suspect 7 or maybe even 6 would be too much to fully enjoy the game. To see all the pieces on the table and the tiles would be quite the pain. Maybe if they had a cheatsheet of all the Basic Tiles and all the Full Tiles, that'd be nice. I kinda wish we didn't need the tile setup boards too. Anything to empty the table and box size a bit more, like not having 7P material. (I'll probably use the 7P one day I think, but I still would've preferred just having up to 6). In my opinion, 1-5P is manageable and you can keep track of and enjoy the game with everyone. At 6P+ people should break into two teams of 3P+ or more.
- wish the rulebook had an index, though I wish this for most rulebooks
- wish they could make the arrow stockpiling actions all in a single row, so we can see and do them in sequence of say, all woods then all stones, etc etc. For the later flipped cards, maybe make the arrows bold too to see more clearly.
- the colors of yellow/white players can be a little harder to discern on the surface of this board's color scheme, so different colors may've been better. Same with cattle and wood being the same color.
- more tiles!

Anyway, despite what it may seem, I say these nitpicks of mine because I'm picky and because I actually like the game so much, so there's tiny ways I think it could've been even more awesome. I still quite like it as it is. The components are easy to pick up and move (unlike Agricola's disks), and there's more stuff to do between turns while waiting for others: decide where to place tile, get loot, etc.

Agricola's major advantage is the variable setup/different options for each game. (I don't count the feeling of struggle/tightness as much of an advantage) Overall, this is also the only avenue I'm concerned with, but I definitely see Caverna playing out with a lot of variability still.

Overall, awesome game where you build a cave/farm and the production is great and gameplay and decision spaces are solid. Better than Agricola in my opinion, though Agricola is more replayable admittedly (its only advantage IMO). I think the only true weakness of this game is its relative lack of variation, for which an expansion or official variants would be needed; all my other gripes with it are relatively minor/inconsequential given what it does better.

Further thoughts at: https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1338982/quick-first-impressions-caverna-positive-review-wi

Plays: 7+

Trading because: setup takes too long and cleanup too, a lot of fiddly bits like fitting the harvest tokens, takes too much table space even at 4p so I can't imagine how bad up to 7p would be, lack of variety setup so games can feel static since interaction is so low, and overall just wish it were more streamlined and a cleaner game. The difficulty getting to the table hurts it too.

Alright, regret selling cause I miss playing a bit. I think Ill rebuy with the Broken Token (maybe Plano if I cheap out but BT is prob better for storage though BT doesnt let box close I heard). When i get my own place, Ill prob have a larger table so thats not a huge concern and the BT will save setup and cleanup. I also intend to print the unofficial Random Tile Selection Setup and Fan Expansion Races for Variabilities between games, since Ive grown to be okay with some variants, esp when its printed out and keeps the crux of the core gameplay. With al that, 1-5p would be more enjoyable imo. I also realize a faster way of tile draw for the 48 which helps:put out 48 board spaces but dont load the tiles. If you buy a tile, put a token or resource marking it then dig it out of he insert while others take their turn. The 48board spaces has the 48 descriptions so its convenient.

Possibly the best game by a great designer (Uwe Rosenberg has affirmed that Caverna is his best game, someone thinks it is just advertisement, I think it can just be simply true!).

It is very similar to Agricola, but so much better in so many ways. And I think I like it even more than Ora et Labora, that was my favorite of Uwe's games until I tried Caverna.

Agricola was more influenced by cards. Here everything is available to everyone from the beginning, but in a very limited quantity. And I agree with a post here on BGG, the better players know this game, the more it will be a real fight for the most valuable things. So much interaction, a lot of nice tension. And very personalized playing is possible. There are many paths to go (I think even more than in Ora et Labora that I loved for this). Strategy is more important than tactics (as in the other two games mentioned, maybe even more).

It is very thematic and realistic (as Agricola, maybe even  more): this makes the game more intuitive to play than Ora et Labora where the effects of buildings were quite weird (in Caverna there are very few things that sound a bit strange, most of the time names of items are easily connected to real things in the dwarfs settings). And the theme is nice also for children at the point that I have never before seen my daughter as excited to play a game as her first game of Caverna. 

One (tiny) thing that I am missing is the rondel for goods that was offered in Ora et Labora that reduced the bookkeeping (but I do see that probably in this case it would have been impossible to adopt it without losing some of the flexibility in goods grow). 

Caverna is great game in itself, it doesn't need comparison with its predecessors: not only it is better than Uwe's other games, but there are very few games, if any, between the many that I have played in my life, that I would prefer to it.  Eventually the most important thing is not the many good attributes of the game, but something that can only be appreciated by playing: this game is incredibly beautiful to play, satisfying, engaging. Gaming experience at his best. It should belong to any gamer's collection, both if already owning other Uwe's games or not. 

Masterpiece. Very recommended. 

UPDATE November 2014
I like Caverna still a lot, but I prefer Fields of Arle. Caverna is still a 10, but Arle has taken its place in my top ten.

UPDATE October 2015
Rating moved from 10 to 9. Although I still consider it  a great game, I think that I would prefer Fields of Arle to it, any time. And this should be reflected in my ratings.

Wow, another Tom Vasel over hype. Yet another farm game, worst, get x, get y, trade it in. How this qualifies as a game is beyond me, having and almost 100 percent open information game, having all the tiles available on a first come first serve is a boring, stagnant boring waste of time. The price is ridiculous for what you get out of it.   Played once and sold. A very badly valued game.

RATING: 6.5
First play was a really great experience. The game can be a little overwhelming at first, but there is a certain clarity to the available actions. 

I did find the build-up in the beginning rounds a little limited. 

I have reason to believe this will rise with more plays.

Additional plays left me feeling a little iffy about some strategies. For example I like the sandbox feel of the game but it feels like it's a losing strategy to focused mining or agriculture. I like the actions, but don't want to just mine or farm. I think getting a 8 level adventurer with black smithing is a tint overpowered.

I play games for escapism, to get away from my own life and spend time as a spacefaring alien race, the king of Spain in the age of exploration, a WWII general, etc. I'm not opposed to trying to manage a farm, if that is all I'm doing, but the mundanity of gathering food and feeding my family is just the kind of boring micromanagement that I'm trying to escape from. The 'Kitchen Sink' design philosophy behind Caverna and its predecessor is just too much for me. The 2-player Agricola: All Creatures Big And Small does away with the extraneous activities and lets players simply focus on animal husbandry, making it my favorite of this family of Uwe Rosenberg's games.

RATING: 8.5
Is it Agricola re-themed with a heavy dose of chrome? Or an inventive update that expands that world? It's hard to separate this game from its predecessor. It's less particular in many ways -- no special scoring that rewards certains types of animals/vegetables over others, the introduction of rubies that serve as wilds, and then the whole thing with expeditions, which is kind of video game like. It's a less constrained, more operatic experience, and therefore gave me a heavier whiff of Ameritrash. Or perhaps a whiff of Le Havre, given that gameplay is about abundance rather than scarcity. I had an enjoyable time, just not sure how much I liked it. It seems like the hallmark of the modern medium-heavy euro is worker placement with tons of options (Euphoria, Russian Railroads, Terra Mystica). The whole elegance angle (Caylus) having played itself out.

RATING: 2
So wait a minute, wait a minute here.  Wait a minute.

You're telling me the reason why Caverna is better than Agricola is because ALL the stuff is available for ALL players to grab, and therefore once I solve the puzzle it's a matter of who gets the perfect route the fastest?

Yeah, no thanks.

Fun game, tons of options. Suffers from super long setup/tear down even with good storage options. 

The openness and freedom of the game is a huge boon; you can win in a variety of different ways. I use a variant where we randomize the available buildings to make sure each game is a bit different. 

I have a really mixed opinion on the Adventuring though. I think it's cool, unique in this type of game, and adds a completely different axis to strategize on. This was one of the things that made me buy this over Agricola. HOWEVER -- it increases AP significantly. Even in a 4p game, oftentimes the adventurer was still picking their last few rewards by the time it got back to their turn. 

I want to play the game at least another 4-5x before deciding whether it has a longterm home in my collection. If the adventuring continues to be a point of slowness, I may have to sell/trade.

There's an infinite loop. This game is soooo long. 6 hours with 4 players is just crazy. The game doesn't change from play to play.

It's just too bad no one is ever interested in playing it due to its length.

--- Preliminary thoughts ---
It's evident that it is Agricola 2, but it adresses it main criticisms and adds several mechanics that improve the game and add even more viable paths to victory.

The components are great.

Only 2 concerns/issues:
-> The game is quite long, I don't think it's viable to play it with more than 5, because of its lenght.
-> Changing the Agricola cards by the fix buildings might hamper replayability and allow pre-built strategies (I'm probably worng on this one).

Rating likely to be improved ;-)

Is it better than Agricola? No.

I'm not going to under-score the game as an Agricola fanboy, because it's a perfectly good honing of Agricola's central premise and mechanics, and the box is just one big treasure-trove of gamers' crack. But there are a lot of flaws:

1) Flabbiness. Too many spaces, too much to do, too little focus.

2) Focussed game-end scoring. People say the Jack-of-all-Trades scoring is a flaw of Agricola, but it is a totally necessary part of the game when you think about it for more than ten minutes. You have to be given clear and many objectives in a game like this. It's nice to be able to formulate your own in Caverna, but this also leads to a lack of competition and dynamic interaction.

3) Prescriptive building. Any belief that there is more freedom to develop your board in Caverna is an illusion. You actually have significantly less freedom than in Agricola because your board will develop the way the game dictates.

4) The hierarchical worker-placement means you can't plan round-to-round strategies.

5) The random harvest tokens feel like a fudge.

I think Ora et Labora did all this better.

Although it’s clearly a game with many fans, I have been a bit disappointed with Caverna on my first few plays.  And I'm a huge Agricola fan.  It has gone down reasonably well  with people I've played it with, however, which I why I'm keeping it for now.

I find the gameplay in Caverna to be less tense and interesting than Agricola.  I also prefer the theme in the latter.  In Caverna, elements such as the occupations, ovens, baking bread and cooking have been dropped.  Although this could be seen as streamlining, I liked those things thematically so its not much of a plus for me.  In contrast, I have found exploring in Caverna (repeatedly picking items from a list) to be a bit boring.

I'm not convinced that it is worth getting both this and Agricola as they are very similar.

En voilà une belle surprise que Caverna! Je pense qu'il est assez difficile d'accès, dans le sens où même si l'on est amateur de boardgames, on ne va pas forcément se diriger vers lui au premier abord. Et ce serait bien dommage de passer à côté d'une telle pépite! (jeu de mot facile :p) Ce que l'on remarque tout d'abord c'est le volume et la qualité du matériel. Les illustrations bien que basiques sont bien colorées et agréables à l'oeil. Les règles peuvent paraître complexes au premier abord mais une fois que l'on a compris la logique, tout va très vite. Plus on avance dans la partie, plus on a de possibilités et plus on calcule dans tous les sens pour coiffer au poteau nos adversaires. Un mode solo est également au rendez vous pour les fanas du scoring. La partie peut être un peu longue mais elle passe vite tellement on ne s'ennuie pas. Les icones que l'on retrouvent dans le jeu sont bien explicites, rendant le jeu encore plus accessible et agréable.
Je ne suis pas "adapte" de ce style de jeu "kubenbois" sans dé, sans aléatoire, mais j'avoue que j'ai été bluffé par les mécaniques et l'intérêt du jeu.
Un très bon jeu à posséder :-)

[b]Caverna[/b] was traded away for At The Gates of Loyang, Ninjato and Carcassonne South Seas (4/30/14).

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]Wow was I excited to get this game. I actually played it before Agricola and thought it was pretty good. Then I played Agricola and realized how much more I enjoyed the card play and difficulty found in Agricola. In the end I did not like the fact that at the beginning of the game every building is available, you are never forced to try a different strategy based on you having limited access to buildings (which is the case with the occupation and minor improvement cards in Agricola). 

I'll mention this again later, but I definitely prefer worker placement games that are more punishing and force you to make difficult choices (which has really prevented me from just buying The Fields of Arle, I want to play it first). I don't think Caverna is a bad game by any stretch, but it is my least favorite Rosenberg game. 

I agree with many that you probably don't need both games in your collection, but Agricola is the game for me. I would play Caverna again, but I won't seek it out.

Having now played Agricola, I much prefer Agricola and do not regret this trade at all. I much prefer Uwe's more punishing games.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

*When I originally wrote this I hadn't played Agricola yet.

[i] I like Caverna, but I prefer Glass Road and for a lighter game Agricola ACBaS. I can't really explain it, it is fun to play but I do not feel the same sense of accomplishment at the end of the game that I get from Glass Road. In my opinion I feel like Glass Road is getting pushed to the side because it came out at the same time as Caverna. I much prefer the card play and resource management found in Glass Road. Maybe Caverna just feels like other WP games I have already played, albeit with a cool theme/wrapper and really nice components.

Will be interested to see how this game fares a year from now. Overall a solid game, but I am not on the hype wagon, go try Glass Road instead![/i]

I prefer Agricola but this one is more suitable for a different type of player - a little gentler. Should you own both? I say that's fine, they play differently enough and they are both works of art. Rating may rise after more plays (2 so far).  Robert Florence summed it up well: "Where Agricola is a knife fight, Caverna is a choose-you-own-adventure farming/mining/development game."

Also get some component boxes for all the bits, consider it an adventure.

Like it's predecessor Agricola, this game is a lovely choice for Thanksgiving and maybe even more fun to play with all of it's plethora of choices you have every turn.
Who wouldn't enjoy Thanksgiving with the Dwarves?
After all they are hearty eaters.

In Caverna your Dwarf can become an adventurer. Provide for his/her family by means of adventuring and mining. Or he/she could go the old fashioned route and farm veggies and raise animals. Or why not a little of both...so many choices and so many resources to play around with.

There are no cards to choose from and create interesting game strategies in Caverna. But the wealth of choices and options open to you every turn really make this game fun!

Solid game. Agricola 2.0. I like it with Agricola that it is tighter and you have more competition. I like it with Caverna that you don't have all these cards. Quite solitary with (too) many options to gain points. But good and fun game to play.

Oy. Misery Farm 2.0 in Cave Man times is one of Paulo's favorites. One of the most basic worker placements: go to a space and you get stuff. While Uwe is a favorite designer in our household, I don't prefer his farming games. Maybe it's the theme, maybe it's the excruciating time between turns, but this game is long...and it feels like it. Caverna is typical of the Euros: never have to look at or talk to anyone if you don't want to; ignore everyone present and just focus on digging in your cave or fencing in your sheep. There are better games that keep everyone constantly engaged.

I guess it's all upside for the Agricola junkies - same game system but with different effects and strategies to explore. Which obviously provides a ton of replay. But worker placement can only take me so far. Where's the drama, the excitement, the fun? With no cards, and all the buildings available for purchase by everyone, it all seems too plannable and calculatable, with just those other pesky players to beat in the race to implement your VP dream engine. The game rewards study of potential engines as a result, with consequent real downtime as options narrow during the game. I preferred the cards in Agricola as it gave a sense of individuality, a sense that is missing here and why I've rated it a point lower. Nice components, but I'm preferring games I don't need to study in order to compete these days.

The tension of knowing you need to expand your family (get more workers), but you can't neglect your farming.  But don't forgot mining.  But while you are seeing to those things, the rounds are passing by and you are loosing valuable time where you can use the extra worker!  I love the balanced system for going on missions.  The strongest dwarf (the one you spent the most time upgrading) goes last.  Everything is a tense decision and requires sacrifice.

in my mind this game should serve as an exemplar for all publishers who produce euros boardgames of this type. This is what its about and should  provide to some of those companies using kickstarter to fund a game the standard they should be achieving ...no excuses it can be done ...

Solo plays only so far
A lot of familiar territory to Agricola but enough differences to warrant both. This one almost has too many choices (in terms of action spaces/buildings) so it can be a bit overwhelming at first.
Contents and production are excellent (even the cover-up cards for some round - nice touch).
Not a 10 as the solo game has a fixed set-up (I realise I could randomise it but assume the designer put it in as such for a valid reason) and I think that limits the replayability, also doesn't have the progressive solo game that made Agricola's solo play so absorbing

This is a great game and really streamlines a lot of the mechanisms in Agricola. I find that most people I play this with prefer Caverna over Agricola but I do not. I really like the Occupation cards in Agricola and how they guide your strategy. Caverna is a little too open for me. Still, I will play this whenever asked.

First play of Caverna was better than expected.  The expeditions and the rubies make the game more forgiving so that if you need something like a vegetable or a stone, it is relatively easy to acquire it without having to put your dwarf on one particular space.  

However, the game takes too long to set up and to take down to be an easy play.

Agricola 2.0.  They've minimized the feed-your-people aspect of the game, to the point so that it makes the game much more enjoyable.  Plus, add on the fact that your people can go adventuring to get more goods just adds more flavor!  And with the addition of hordes of tiles, replayability is through the roof, without the hassle of complete randomness.  It's a perfect mix!

RATING: 9.5
One of the better games of the five in the trilogy :-) 

This lacks most of the things that make Agricola a poor game, but keeps the few good things and builds on that. 

After a few plays: This is a typical Rosenberg. As intended is has a lot of common with Agricola, but is more open and is more about choices than desperation. It also have some in common with Ora et Labora. 

First play had very little food and felt too much like Agricola: A lot you wanna do, too few actions, then you eat and the game is over. Dunno if it it was a coincidence or just poor beginners, but the next few plays were better. 

I like the variation in possible winning strategies. 
I would have liked a little bit more variation in actions though. I mean more variation between games, now you know all that will come and can, if you want to, use the same strategy over and over again.

3 Plays - Really loved the complexity and challenge, but ultimately can't play a game where the playing part takes about as long as it does to setup/ do the upkeep. Every game I felt as if I achieved so little given the time inputted. So many components make it necessary for lots of small bags to separate all of the them, as well as so much space on your table for separate piles of bits and pieces. Very hard for everyone playing to see the available room tiles and their effects given the number of components that need to be at a hands reach. Overall, fantastic gameplay, artwork and theme - but so annoying to manage, setup and actually physically organise everything in a way that is visually appealing and visible/ handy to everyone playing.

The game has its appeal, no doubt. But it has its bad side, for me.
It is interesting looking for many, many options to score points. But, I can't see playing this game with more than 3 players. There is a lot of dead time in the game.
From putting it out and in the box (it's a hell), to replenishing supplies to AP prone players who would ruin it for me...I just don't think it's good enough for me to stand all that for a very good gaming experience.
Some other games offer as much in terms of gameplay, but without as many downsides.

Very similar to Agricola in its main mechanics, but different in other ways. You have a lot more items to manage including donkeys, dogs and rubies. You also have a few more standard building types and the cards have been replaced by buildings that everyone can build but are all limited to one. This is still a worker placement and engine building game, so if you like that, it is one of the better ones but likely for more advanced players.

I'm a big fan of Agricola so I was excited to give this a try when my friend picked it up. My first impression was that i took up so much space! A lot of boards and pieces. I was also quite surprised about the number of harvests and feeding events, as I was under them impression that feeding your workers was easier in Caverna, but I felt that it was actually harder at times, especially when you weren't sure whether or not you needed to get food together. 

I really missed the lack of cards in this and I felt that the rooms did not replace them well. The fact that someone could steal a room before you made me feel that you couldn't plan a strategy as well as you can in Agricola. I also wasn't fussed on the adventuring aspect, it just seemed like a cheap way to get tons of extra stuff, plus people could spend ages picking from the 'menu' of items you can bring back from an adventure.

I wish I had a better impression from my first play, but it put me off so much that I'm not sure I want to try it again.

Everybody compares this to Agricola, and I can see why.  My thing though is that I have never played Agricola.  Yes I know.  Shocking.  

One thing I take from this is that my game group and I had no preconceived ideals about this type of worker placement game before going in to it because none of us had played Agricola before.  

When we played Caverna for the first time, it blew us away.  This game was an INSTANT HIT with my game group.  We played it every weekend for four weekends in a row.

We go back and play this at least once every couple months now.  This game will be part of our stable of games for a long, long time.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Great game that hurts due to the lack of variable setup. Based on the way the boards for building tiles are laid out I get the impression the designer didn't have much expansion in mind.

Fortunately since there isn't much AP in my group this doesn't take 3 hours. However it ends up running a little long since we often have 5.

Possibly this is due to the low number of plays but it seems that there are only two approaches, quests and otherwise. This seems like the biggest problem in my opinion. Definitely overrated at such high rank.

Going to try to get a few more 2 player games in with the wife and see if this is worth keeping. I still enjoy it and I get the feeling that it could grow on us once we no longer suck at it so bad. I think there is enough variety in tiles that the lack of variable setup won't be a dealbreaker.

2-4 players: Great.
5 players: A bit much.
6-7 players: Oh good grief.

Update: I can't believe this is now ranked 3 on BGG. This game doesn't deserve to be in the top 100 let alone 10. When are people going to see Uwe's farming designs as linear copies of each other?

Caverna is very, very similar to Agricola, to the point where it kind of feels like you're playing some sort of bizarre Agricola expansion.  In addition to the normal crop raising and animal husbandry (complete with the Farmers of the Moor idea of clearing your fields), you have the options to mine gems out of your cave, and give your workers "weapons" to go on adventures for your choice of a bunch of different resources.  In this game, it feels like it's a lot easier to get what you need, which for me removes some of tension that I enjoyed in Agricola.  It does seem like the various paths are well-balanced, though.

Wow, this blew Agricola out of the water for me. We barely scratched the surface of this game and we were only playing the basic game. Jen didn't seem to hate it as much as she thought she was going to, but I'm worried that it will end up like Agricola for her. The food pressure is still there, but I felt less constrained by it since you can convert anything into food at any time.

I can see this rising another notch after a few more plays, but time will tell. This game is at least a solid 8, but could be a 10.

[b]Update[/b]: Well, it's no Agricola killer for me as it's far more fiddly overall. Points are much easier to get and the game has a standard set of tiles each time. I like it, don't get me wrong, but I prefer Agricola over this title.

Extras: Water Promo tiles.

It's a worker placement game, like Agricola. There are many options in the game, as you can go towards farming, furnishing your cave or go for an expedition. I've played just one game against people who had played Agricola before (me being a completely noob) and I won the game; still, I didn't enjoy it.

This game is really LONG and very FIDDY. I don't mind with games that have many components, like Puerto Rico, or games that last long, like Caylus, but this game exceeds my limits in both categories. I did find it interesting in terms of choices and strategy, but I had the feeling that the game was playing me and not vice-versa. Especially the "you have to constantly feed your people" made me feel that I was being played; Stone Age has a similar mechanism, but eventually you can control it.

Bottom line: too long, too fiddy, too much analysis-paralysis. Interesting choices, but hardly to play it again.

Absolutely amazing game - tense, full of interesting choices and very much streamlined and polished. Could be called Agricola 2.0 if you like, but stands very well on its own. There is a lot of new gaming fun whether you have or haven´t played Agricola prior this. Despite all the buildings being available at start the replay value stands very well, at least after 9 plays. Plays quite differently with different player counts. Much harder to reach your goals in 2 player game than in 4 player game for example.

This game is so unbelievably fun, I love everything about it. I don't enjoy games that I can't play with at least 3 players, even if they are intended for 2 or more, has to have at least 3 players for me, EXCEPT for this. I will play this 2 players and still have a great time. I've played Agricola, loved Agricola, this is so much better in every way in my opinion. There's nothing mean in this game, you don't really attack or hurt your opponents, you just build yourself up and whoever does the best wins. This is my all-time favorite worker placement game and another contender for my favorite game of all time. I will play this any time someone else wants to play, I can't imagine ever turning down playing a game of Caverna.

The game was similar to Agricola.  It had a "nicer" feel with the food collection and expeditions.  I liked the shared pool of buildings.  I liked the option to trade various resources for food.

The game seemed to take a lot longer than Agricola.  Some of the rounds took quite awhile later on while people decided what to get from their buffet options on expeditions.  I felt there were many fiddly rules with the animals and not as clean as Agricola.  The hidden harvest aspect I also didn't care for.

A good game, would play again (with less people), however I'd stick with Agricola.

RATING: 7
Let me start by saying the Agricola is one of my Top 10 games. I love the tension and challenge of that game and I was initially dismissive of an updated version that eschews that tension. Then I tried the game…and I really liked it. There is still tension, as family members still need to be fed, but there a lot of interesting things to do. One of the things I particularly liked is the ability to arm my dwarves. This allows them to go on adventures, sometimes an addition to taking other actions. However, the dwarves with the highest level must be played last, so they are often limited in what actions are available to them. This sets up a trade off in the game that forces players evaluate the cost-benefit of having highly armed dwarves vs. peaceful people. In our learning game, the winner actually never took the family growth action, but made his two dwarves highly skilled warriors and benefitted strongly from their adventures. It is appealing that keeping a small family may be a viable strategy. Will I miss Minor Improvements and Occupations? Yes, I think so, though I can’t comment on the variety of building that are available and how they change. Perhaps that will provide enough variability to compensate. I’m really looking forward to playing this again.

Mixed feelings about this - Agricola is still one of my favourite games, and I really thought I would enjoy this even more. On the one hand I think it's an interesting redesign and I can see why some feel this is an improvement. But to me it also feels overwrought, too fiddly, and just too much like an optimisation puzzle, losing much of Agricola's tension and charm.

In Agricola, I often get a real sense of achievement, whether it's growing the family, baking bread, building a plough, or even just managing to feed everyone, but in Caverna most things are comparatively easy to come by, so there is no such sense of accomplishment, and the feeding phases of the harvest feel like minor inconveniences instead of important milestones that need to be carefully planned around.

Many of the mechanisms are very similar to Agricola (and even more similar to Agricola: All Creatures Big & Small) but with several extra layers of clutter and fiddliness. I feel it would have been better if Caverna had stood a bit further apart, maybe dropping the grain/vegetables, having fewer animals, and focussing more on the digging/gem mining/expeditions. As it is, it falls foul of my increasing distaste for sameyness in games, and I don't think I'll want to bother with it very often. I have a sense of nostalgia for Agricola, remembering how excited I was to play it when it first came out - Caverna does nothing of the sort for me.

Not sure how to rate it - in terms of game quality it's a 9 or 9.5, but in terms of how enthusiastic I am to play it it's only a 6 or so, so I'm settling on the middle ground of 8.

I got to play this game finally at my local meetup and it makes me happy that I've get to try this new top 10 material from Uwe. 

To get it out of the way I will have to say I enjoy Agricola more than Caverna. 

Caverna does have its strength though. It feels less pressured to feed your people and there seems to be more path to victory. (It doesn't really forces you to do everything). It has a level up mechanism that is hard to ignore and yet the player at our player who won the 5-player game didn't really go dwarfs strategy.

I can say this game is pretty balanced in terms of strategy. It does have more of a point salad feel to it in my first game although some strategies do carry through from Agricola. It was nice to be able to jump into the game pretty easily with experiences in Agricola.

The only down side is that this game is so fiddly with the bits.

Don't know what to think about this game after 1 play. I certainly like it. It's definitely a sort of Agricola+. However getting food for your dwarves, doens't seem to be so cut-throat as in Agricola, at least that's the feeling I had. I never got a real food engine, but you can get it on a lot of places and the fact that you can convert your animals into food without the need of a cooking place, seems to facilitate things a lot. 

The lack of cards is for me a bit of a bummer, as for me there were the salt & pepper of Agricola. Here you have more common buildings to chose from.

The biggest plus of Caverna is that you have even more strategies to go for to score points.

[First Play, Solo] I certainly enjoy this more than Agricola. The first play didn't grab me as much as I anticipated, but I don't think solo play is where this one will shine. I expect my current rating (8) may go up with multiple players.

RATING: 9.5
A superb worker placement game from the king of WP. Takes the excellent Agricola as a foundation and improves upon it by adding more resources and more mechanisms like cave developing and adventuring. Not quite one of Rosenberg's absolute best games, imo, but still a fantastic creation.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.7
Carvena has a less tense feeling that Agricola, because of more available actions spaces. The number of different building is huge (and clearly influenced by Rosenberg's other games). Caverna feels very promising, but I'll have to play more until I can decide whether if it's really great.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.8
Felt this took out all the tension that made Agricola great. I can understand why people like this game more, but I enjoy how tight Agricola feels as a game, the time you take a move matters, if you mistime something, you have dire consequences. None of those harsh consequences exist in Caverna.

With that said, I do enjoy the theme and the expanded cave system, just wish the game have more valuable decisions to make.

Another Uwe R game I was dying to play. Ever since I learned Fields of Arle- I was on a quest to learn them all. 

This was pretty easy to come by since many of my gaming friends have it

I still love Arle the most but this is close behind and I would love to play anytime.

RATING: 8
This game is a modernization of Agricola, and it does a fantastic job. Every issue I've had with Agricola is wiped away by this game. It delivers on all the things I liked about it's predecessor and adds to it some really genius innovations such as the way the workers level up and the way that you can follow through with different strategies and still get high scores.

In particular, one of the things I disliked about Agricola was the way that getting more family members was a bit of a dominant strategy. In caverna I get the same core farming mechanisms, minus the flip luck of the cards plus the game has a perfectly viable strategy for having fewer, stronger workers.

:star: Art, Iconography and components functional
:star: Clever or interesting mechanisms

:star::star::star::nostar::nostar: Raw enjoyment

RATING: 8
I enjoy it.  The components are undeniably awesome, and set up is generally faster than Agricola.  The adventuring is interesting and gives your workers a bit of personality.  The random harvest idea is a cool one (and I think borrowed somewhat from the "Four Seasons" postcard expansions for Agricola), and there's lots of neat little ways the game is interesting and distinct from its predecessor.  
Complaints are few: the box is a little flimsy, and the rules have some minor ambiguities.  
That said, I'm happy to have this in my collection.  It is a fun, fairly easy-to-play worker placement game.

Better than Agricola? After two years I still can't say, but I like it. 

Harder to set up, perhaps a bit more multi-faceted with the adventure process giving a new angle to the game and a flexible way to grow, and perhaps even a "harder" game in that it involves less randomness and the only things in your way are your opponents and how much you can figure out. 

But it's basically Agricola beyond that; pieces, flavor, and mechanics. Will you miss the cards? Probably. Will you have fun? Definitely.

I really like this one, but I'm not sure I like it better than Agricola.  It's harder to compare than you might think because they often feel very different.  There are so many similarities, but the major pieces of the game seem completely distinct.

On one hand, all of the ways in which the game has mitigated getting screwed out of your spot is really nice for a friendlier game.  But those rubies allow for so many extra options that it can really create some serious Analysis Paralysis where none might have previously existed.

The houses replace the Agricola cards, which again allows people flexibility to do what they want and not get screwed.  But at the same time it reduces replayability and I worry players will stagnate either in their favorite strategy or in group think.

So it's greatest assets are also it's greatest flaws.  Tough to say which way to go, but for now I like Agricola better.

Hard to say which is better, Caverna or Agricola. Agricola has a solid theme; Caverna is awkwardly bifurcated. Caverna does take up more table space (more boards). Way less cards, but way more resource tokens and tile types. So it is a trade off and it is hard to say which is better.

Played it twice so far. Very fun. I've played Agricola 50 times, so of course it's going to get a lot of comparisons to Agricola. Its a similar game, but with more freedom. I was afraid that less stress and less punishing meant less strategy. But I think there's still a lot of room for strategy and optimization. I don't know which is a better game at this point. My wife likes Caverna better because it's less stressful. The theme seems more flavorful than Agricola and a lot more flavorful than Le Havre. I seem to like all the Uwe Rosenberg games I've played, but maybe not as much as the FFG games I enjoy? Not sure. Maybe I should play more Uwe.

Fantastic Game, simply love Caverna. Currently my favorite game of all time and not sure when that will end. Haven't been able to play that often however, and do fear strategies will eventually get stagnant and the game will feel "solved". Absolutely in love with Caverna still, will always play. 

Update: Probably no longer my favorite game of all time, I've moved this rating to a 9. It is a fantastic game but the static set up really reduces the strategic richness that its predecessor Agricola possesses. Repeated plays are still quite enjoyable but Caverna slowly loses its luster once you've tried many various combination of furnishings and have worked out the best ones.

Nagyon szomorú apropóból került elő.(gondolatelterelés miatt) Nagyon jó játék. Hasonló az agricolá-hoz persze, de kicsit más. Annyival, hogy más játék legyen. De ettől függetlenül, mindkettő nem feltétlenül kell egy gyűjteménybe. Ezt már fújhatom. A rubint kicsit erősnek tűnt, és a harci törpéket sem érzem különösen erősnek, de csak két személyesben játszottuk, így torz lehet a vélemény ilyen szempontból.
De anyag van benne, az már biztos.
Update: több, 5 és 6 és 3 személyes játék után megállapítható, hogy egészem máshol vannak a játék súlypontjai, ami szerintem igen jól lett eltalálva. Kell mindkét játék egy gyűjteménybe! :)

Oct 2014: The first game I bought without playing first. I did as much research as I could.

I enjoy this game - we played 4 times our first weekend and bought the Broken Token insert. I hope there are expansions. I might get lured by Agricola; I want a random-card option this doesn't have (at the moment... come on Uwe...you can doooitttt)

Broken Token Insert: you must get it...fixes set up /tear down

Feb 2016: I have 2/3 expansions but we need more people who know this to play it. We've played lots of 2-player and, like TEG, I like this with 3+ better; though 2 is a good race. Dropping 0.3 rating for play rate.

Feb 2017: It still suffers from other heavier games being chosen. I'm almost calling this super-gateway now.

First thoughts: it's a solid game, but everything it does, it does worse than "Agricola" (or "Fields of Arle" if you prefer more of a sandbox experience). For me, it falls somewhere in between; it's not tense enough, but it's also not open enough. Depending on my mood, I'd rather play "Agricola" or "Fields", but never "Caverna", which feels... undefined. Will give it a few more chances, but I'm not a fan (while it still being a good game, don't get me wrong!). 

UPDATE: No, [i]Agricola[/i] is so much better. Sold.

There is almost as much agony planning your turns as in Agricola - if not more. Having the furnishing taken that you've had your eye on for a couple rounds is awful! This is a great game.

Meu primeiro jogão! Em tamanho, é claro... hehehe
Comprei ele numa viagem, e ficar carregando pra lá e pra cá esses quase 5 kgs (mais as outras coisas) foi uma loucura.

Quanto ao jogo em sí, é um ótimo jogo. Joguei desde solo até 5 jogadores. Adoro a versão para dois, e acho que o melhor é em 3.

O setup é um pouco demorado (dei uma aliviada nisso organizando as peças em caixinhas) e isso as vezes dá uma preguiça de começar uma partida.
O jogo não é longo quando todo mundo já conhece. Passa bem rápido.

Um ponto negativo depois de 10 partidas, é que chega um momento em que você percebe que existem poucos caminhos possíveis, e você está fadado a escolher entre eles. Mais ou menos como acontece com o Puerto Rico.

Espero que lancem uma expansão que deixe o setup mais variavel, principalmente nos furnishing tiles.

Ainda assim, é um jogaço!

Thoughts after first play: I liked it, but have some reservations. Took four of us (one experienced player and three noobs) three hours to play, so 45 mins. per player vs. 30 mins on the box. We were very rushed at the end--right when the tendency is to slow down and make sure you are doing the most to maximize your score--because we had to end our session at 3 hours. I'm not a huge fan of games where you are analyzing a dozen options to figure out which one gets you the most points, and in this game, "a dozen options" is a euphamism, since ALL of your options are publicly available--you have no hidden agenda options like you do with the cards in Agricola. So on the one hand, I liked that you could set up the game and start playing without having to examine your cards and possibly decide which ones to keep, but I didn't like that there were SO many options to choose from. A little overwhelming. I can imagine that for a super-competitive group or one where analysis paralysis was permitted to run wild, it would be a very slow game. We all had "if I had done this instead of that" regrets at the end. There are also A LOT of bits in this box. It's that fat for a reason--filled to the top with no insert. It also takes up a lot of table real estate, born from the fact that everything is public, so it all has to be laid out. I do want to play again, and soon, because with more plays will come better knowledge of the possible options (especially the cavern upgrades) and more confidence. Better than Agricola? Less punishing on the feeding aspect, in large part due to the rubies, which act like wildcards that you can spend almost any time you need them, so if the feeding in Agricola turns you off, then Caverna provides more flexibility without removing the mechanic entirely. For me, that's better. Thematically, I prefer Agricola. You are a human farmer in pre-industrial Europe. In Caverna, you are a cave-dwelling, mining, farming, adventuring dwarf. I can't relate as well to that (but I do like the addition of adventuring). Overall, I liked it and want to play it again. I won't rate it higher than Agricola (yet), but no lower.

Worker placement is one of my favorite/preferred game mechanics. With that being said, I have lots of fun playing this game since it gives you so many great options and paths to victory. I also like building games where you get to see what you created at the end. That feeling makes losing still fun. I personally prefer this to Agricola since it is much less tense, and in my opinion, easier to learn.

I find myself drawn to the really big, fiddly games with lots of components. I absolutely love Caverna. It's a ton of fun. I have barely any Agricola experience (played once or twice on my iPad) so I can't compare the two. But on its own, Caverna is a ton of fun. I love the idea of an engine building game, and this one definitely lets you. It has a lot of components but it's not a complicated game at all. Easy to learn, easy to play, and extremely fun. Also for a game of this size and weight (literally. The box weighs a ton) I was surprised at how fast the games went. 30 minutes per player is not an understatement.

This game has the largest variation in rating over time (for me).  When I play it, I'm reminded how much I like it.  Because it takes so long to setup, and it plays so long (especially with AP players) we go months without playing it and the rating tends to drop.

I would never play this game with more than 4 - as a result I paid for 3 players worth of components I don't want!  Uwe, get your shit together writing rule books, bro.  The rule book sucks (this is a problem I've had with all big Uwe games I've played)!

This game is so tight and there are so many variations of viable strategies.  I love worker placement and this one is among the best I've played.  If only this game wasn't so long...

Agricola 2.0 that is well executed and better that it's predecessor in some areas. Though I like the game and it's new options like designing your cave and going for quests etc. the only thing is I prefer the higher tension of struggling to feed your family in Agricola better which makes the game tighter and more urgent.

Didn't think it was bad, but expected to like it more than I did. It's deeper and more complex than Agricola but it's a lot easier to feed. You are working more to maximize points than to avoid starvation. I would play again, but our game with 5 players (three of them new) took nearly four hours (including rules). Need a shorter play experience to make this a viable game to play regularly.

RATING: 8.3
This game pulls a lot for the mechanics from Agricola but the strategy and tactics are quite different.  There are no cards in this game but instead there are building tiles.  I like that all the construction is done on the player board  and has a nice tile laying feel rather than having a tableau of cards.  It just feels more thematic.  Since there is only one of each dwelling tile this creates competition for tiles.  Thus, there is more player interaction as strategies collide and tactical decisions have to be made once your tile has been bought.  As a solo game, it's pretty good but i worry since there is no variation with setup and no random elements from game to game (not true for multi-player games) that this becomes more of a puzzle as you just try the same things over again.  Overall, fun game that I think would play best with 2 or 3.  Anymore would be too long of a game.  I'm still not sure if I like this as much as Agricola but more plays will help. Update:  played again and this really doesn't seem as much like Agricola but more of a cross between Agricola and Ora et Labora. I liked it a little more the second time around and I've only play the basic game.

I first played it in solo mode, and I was surprised how I enjoyed it trying to score as much as I could. After my first 2 player play, I really love this game even though after 1:40h of game. It will be interesting how long is it going to take for 4 players. I'll be back to comment it once done.

Edit: Once done a 4 player game, we all enjoyed it but it took us 2:20h. As it was the first play for the half of the crew I can say the time of 30min/player is nailed. 

Edit: It is definitely one of my favorite games ever.

Another game by Uwe Rosenberg. Take resources, combine them, move them, breed them, grow them and transform into other things. Use them to build tings, or feed people, and ultimately make victory points. This is quite overtly a redesign of Agricola, but since Le Havre and Ora et Labora were also redesigns of that game it feels a little like the designer is doing their play testing on the consumer. The problem here is that I still don't feel like the game has quite cracked it. The masses of bits and many exceptions are still too fiddly, while the addition of the expeditions as a parallel way of developing and collecting resources actually detracts from the competitiveness of the game. These are good games but they demand more than casual play and I can't imagine anyone choosing to do that with four different games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A complete reworking of Agricola - itself already a great game, of course - and in my opinion an improvement, this replaces much of the "how do I get my food?" tension of the original with a sense of abundance (it's relatively easy to get food as everyone can get food from animals without having to buy a cooking implement first, most actions give several benefits at once, and there are also rubies as wildcard resources), but puts the real decisions elsewhere. It's much more like a standard Euro now, in that there are multiple routes to the victory points (no longer does every farm look identical at the end of the game) and you have to make the same sort of tricky decisions as in any other worker placement game - what to prioritise at this moment? Do I need an extra worker now, or is it not worth the extra food it'll cost me (unlike its parent, here my feeling is that it's not absolutely necessary to grab a couple of extra workers as soon as possible)? Which building (technically "furnishing") do I build now? (And there is only one of each, apart from the basic dwellings for extra workers.)

These furnishing tiles are another big difference from Agricola - essentially replacing the cards of the original - giving, as I have said, a wide variety of approaches to take, and giving a dilemma as to whether you spend your precious resources on the furnishing early before trying to build up its value, or leaving it till later (when your economy is more able to handle it, but risking not getting it at all if you've telegraphed your intentions to others). There are also weapons to build to go on "expeditions" (essentially just another way of getting several resources or other benefits at once), and new types of animals and more complicated rules on how you can keep them.

I must say that for me, and most others in my gaming groups (although interestingly not so much my wife, who prefers Agricola for being more streamlined, which it undoubtedly is), Caverna is a big improvement on Agricola. I still don't find myself loving it though, so I can only give this a rating of 8 - the same as my rating for Agricola, despite me thinking this is an improvement. I do think there is room in a collection for both, they are actually quite different games in feel despite one clearly being an evolution of the other. Great game, but not for me a "must play".

Really enjoy the change to a more engine based system over the need to dabble in everything from Agricola. I still think Agricola is great but I think Caverna stands on its own with this difference. 

I don't mind having all of the buildings available at the beginning of the game and I disliked the randomness of the cards from Agricola so this is a reasonable change to me.

I enjoyed this game a lot. There's a lot to do and you want to do everything. There's a decent amount of opportunity for analysis paralysis. I've seen a decent focus on making sure that there's enough food to feed your people, but it's not so hard that you can't do anything else. I especially like the ability to arm your dwarves and go on quests. It looks like there's a lot of stuff to setup and cleanup, but it's easier than it looks. If you are going to play it often, then a nice insert would be worth the investment.

RATING: 6
Não me conquistou. Tudo bem que jogar com 6 provavelmente está longe do recomendado, mas minhas questões com o jogo acho que perpassariam qualquer número de jogadores. E a comparação com o Agrícola é cruel.

Primeiro, se é pra fazer uma variação do Agrícola, tem que ser melhor. Entre jogar Agrícola e um outro jogo parecido e pior, por que não o original? O Caverna pode ser um bom approach pra quem nunca jogou Agrícola, por que é bem mais fácil de aprender, mas pra quem já aprendeu, não sei se faz sentido.

Antes de começar a descascar, vamos às vantagens:

1. As regras são mais fáceis de aprender mesmo. Não tem forno, não tem padeiro, não tem occupation, minor nem major improvement. Quase tudo dá um ponto, não tem aquela tabelinha, mais fácil de memorizar. Cercas e estábulos foram simplificados.

2. Por não ter tudo isso, a fritação de cérebro é menor, o que leva, me pareceu, a menos demora para escolher a jogada que você vai fazer.

Mas pra compensar tem várias desvantagens tb.

1. Muitas casas tem ações múltiplas, como a das expedições. Você chega a poder fazer quatro ações de uma tacada só, e a demora para isso pode ser grande, compensando a rapidez para escolher a jogada.

2. Não sei se gostei de o jogo ser tão abundante. A interação do Agrícola se dava pela escassez. Você tinha medo de deixar de pegar o Bake Bread e se estrepar no Harvest, por isso adiantava sua jogada mesmo sendo sub-ótima ou ia no Starting Player pra garantir sua alimentação na próxima rodada. Ou você pegava o Bake Bread só de sacanagem pra marcar o adversário. A interação do jogo estava aí. No Caverna, alimentação é bem menos dramática, crescer família não é obrigatório. Tem várias ações que te permitem alcançar quase o mesmo objetivo, e mesmo quando não tem, existem duas ações que te permitem fazer a ação que o amiguinho já fez. Quase tudo é possível, quase o tempo todo, então a interação e o bloqueio são quase irrelevantes. Ficou pra mim multiplayer-solitaire demais.

3. O autor diz no manual que o jogo foi projetado para que em partidas com muitos jogadores seja necessário haver um equilíbrio entre quem aposta em expedição e quem não aposta para não não despontar um líder. Diz ele que se todos apostarem em expedição menos um, esse um certamente vai vencer. E se só um apostar em expedição, esse um vai vencer. Pode ter sido só o nosso jogo, pode ter sido noobice nossa, mas na nossa partida, a única jogadora que não fez expedições ficou longe de vencer. O jogo parece estar desequilibrado em favor das expedições. Mas foi só uma partida, difícil dizer.

I prefer Agricola.

The random assignment of occupations and improvements in Agricola forces players to adapt different strategies each game, adding to the game's replayability.

In contrast, Caverna's static selection of buildings might make it more calculable and predictable.

Heavy, figuratively and literally. New to me but first game was a blast. It feels sandbox with 2 player be a farmer or rancher or miner or adventurer or a little of all. Can't wait to play agian. Update 12/9/16:
Will keep in collection. Been playing solo lately. Can't believe I like it so much so many strategies to beat my last score. I usually hate that type game. Better still with all different #'s of players. Have kept track of those scores also to compete with myself with a previous score with the same # of players. Think I'm obsessed with it. Haven't had any 6 player+ games yet want to try though. P.s. may be my absolute favorite game war of the ring has competition now.

.... definitely not as good as Agricola.  The lack of dynamic content (content that varies from game to game) really limits the potential of this design.  Also, I absolutely hate how the goal cards must be purchased centrally, yet they provide no infrastructure.   Also, it just seems like the level of intensity in the game has been greatly decreased, due to all actions just being "awesome".  Because when everything is awesome, nothing is.

So much fun! It would be great to have variable set-up, but some of the fan-made variants seem like a great fix. The set-up and clean-up are a bit of a task, but the game has lots of viable paths to victory. I like this over Agricola because, to me, it is easier (less punishing).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It is virtually impossible to honestly comment on this game without comparing it to Agricola. I'll start by saying while I do like Caverna, it feels like a less focused, less tense, more wide open, more forgiving and more... meandering Agricola.

One of the biggest changes in this game is the move from a private stash of cards to buildings available to everyone. In theory, I like that change, but in practice... I have mixed feelings about it. The cards helped give focus to Agricola and helped drive your actions down a different path than the other players. Without this initial nudge at a direction, Caverna, especially for new players, can feel like wandering aimlessly for a while. There are so many options, it's hard to even know where to start. 

In Caverna, there are so many "good" choices that the tension for optimizing the best choices feels lacking for much of the game. I think part of that is because of it's loose food conversion rules, part of that is due to the fact that every animal is worth the same points at the end, and part of it is that any particular resource is extremely easy to come by. After three plays it seems that often a players choice seems to be: pick one of 3-4 equally good things; it doesn't really matter what you pick. A ruby is as good as a vegetable is as good as a pig.

I'm not sure how I feel about the expeditions. The mechanic seems tacked on, and it's almost as if the designer thought players needed an even easier way to get the resources they need. It just further takes away from the tension of the game. 

All that probably sounds like I don't like Caverna. If Agricola didn't exist, and/or I had played this first, I actually would probably like it a lot. As it is, though, it didn't grab me initially as much as Agricola did, nor does it have the staying power Agricola has. There is really no reason both this and Agricola should be in my collection; Agricola is clearly the superior game and I can't ever see reaching for this game instead. To justify keeping both, Caverna would either need to be more approachable, play in less time, or offer a better challenge- and it does none of those things.

Except for the newly added adventure action, this is an amazing game. Agricola is no more.

RATING: 6
Feels more flexible than Agricola as there are more options for choice of actions.  Players can launch into various paths early.  No hidden or asymmetric information as one got from the cards in Agricola as all the options are open from the start, the variation comes from how players develop their tableaus.  I am concerned that this might lead to set opening moves after a while as a result.  The only real randomizing element is how the round cards come out.  The downside (perhaps only initially) is that the numerous options can make the first plays a bit slower as players consider options.  

A game with a lot of bits (cardboard and wood) that needs a large table to play - even with a low number of players.  In the end an interesting game, but one that can drag on (even for those who know Agricola - I would feel sorry for the absolute tyro who doesn't have the references to Agricola to fall back upon.)  Need to be in the right mood to play this one, so rated a 6 as a result.  Not the first game I would rush to play, but one I might enjoy sporadically throughout the year.

Better than Agricola because there are fewer, more readable cards. But the set-up is still fiddly and the gameplay remains rather too open and loose for my taste. I much prefer Glass Road.

RATING: 8
Nice game but not as good as Agricola.

Positives: Components are great! 
I like the weapon system and having to send your weak dwarfs first.
Negative: I do not like the removal of baking/cooking animals. It's too easy now and it makes grain really boring since it's just 1 food. 
The point system - Many people love this. I hate it. Since all animals are equal, the different types of animals are less important. It doesn't make sense that point wise, the cows are worth the same as sheep. 
Resources - I felt like I had way too many resources in the early game. I didn't even know what to do with all of my wood that I picked up. I was spending it with reckless abandon and I wasn't able to run out until the last game. It's not as tight as I would like it. Rooms are too cheap and there isn't a resource that is hard to get. I really like that reed in Agricola is hard to get and everyone wants to get it. In this game, wood and stone is abundant so it's not difficult to get a lot of it. If anything, the only hard thing to get is ore and that's if a bunch of people are going the weapon route. In short, the game is too open. Since there are completely different routes to go, there is less competition for each resource and that's a bad thing.
Same rooms available each game - I can see the game getting very samey in the future. There's very little in the game that changes from game to game. 

With all that hate... I still enjoyed the game and an 8 is a good rating. Besides being different though, it's a strictly worse game than Agricola + expansion for me.

26-01-2015. Rated after a second play. I like Caverna better than Agricola. With 2 or 3 this games moves fast and is interesting. I did not enjoy it with 5 (too slow for my tastes).

06-09-2014. Rated after 1 play. I played Agricola about 1 week before trying out Agricola 2.0, Caverna. Both are very similar games, with the mechanisms basically carried over almost 100%. The largest perceived drawbacks of Agricola are the fixed scoring, which Caverna fixed by decreasing the severity of punishment and rewarding specialisation. 

I liked Caverna a lot, and maybe better than Agricola. I played Caverna with 4, but I suspect I would've liked it better with 3 or 2. I wonder about replayability of Caverna a little, given that the many cards available for Agricola are cut from this design, potentially making the game feel samey.. Then again, I suspect that expansions will be made for Caverna, fixing this issue.

While I currently rank Caverna lower than Agricola (7 vs 7.5), this could be because I played Agricola with 2 making for a speedier game that I enjoyed better.

Just another version of Agricola, IMO. I also have a problem with the theme, seeing that traditionally, Dwarves don't farm. They mine. That part of the game works fine to me.

Played a friend's copy.  Despite how long the game can go for, I still feel like I accomplished something after all that time, even if I don't win.  I like making stuff, optimizing what I've got, planning, etc.  The components are all really nice, especially the animeeples you get.

Despite my enjoyment in playing, I was very concerned with lack of replay value due to the lack of variety.  That was getting in the way of my decision to purchase.  To make purchasing worth while, I intend to use this variant: [thread=1128291][/thread]

RATING: 9
I go back and forth whether I prefer this one over Agricola, but for me personally, Agricola is still #1.  The cards just force me to do something different every game, whereas with Caverna I can tend to go after the same combination of rooms that I know served me well in past games.  Plus I love the Farmers of the Moor expansion and the great variety of major improvements.  But for fun factor for the whole table, Caverna is better - it is less stressful to feed your family, there's a lot more interaction than you get in most WP games with all the competition over buying weapons/going on the best expeditions/using rubies to cut in line, and there just always seems to be good spots to go on, whereas the Agricola end-game often traps you into either risking planning a specific 3 or 4-step sequence of actions that you must follow to score some big points but can be easily blocked, or having a few actions at the end that get you 0 or maybe 1 point.  Plus it's much easier to examine and digest the variety of rooms while you are playing the game, whereas new players to Agricola need a significant amount of time before they start to examine their hand of 14 cards.  So I think for new players to heavier WP's, I would recommend going straight to Caverna.

I quite like this game but it's a bit too "wide open" with too many similar options to choose from which can take too long to weigh up in order to play optimally. Also, setup should be more variable in my opinion. Having said that, I've only ever played with two players and I suspect gets better with more but may take a little too long.

Less stressful than Agricola as easier to feed, plus harder to get blocked. But also less interesting because every game the same. Whereas every game of Agricola changes because of your cards.

I have only played this once and only 3/4 of the way through (went longer than expected) but based on that, I did enjoy this game but it is quite long. A lot of fiddly bits.  It is enjoyable but there are other games that have a similar feel, that are less fiddly,  that I probably enjoy just as much.

Though apparently a reimplementation of Agricola, the differences and additions to the game system make Caverna feel different enough to make it worth owning both, and also to make most people prefer one over the other.  I think that in my case it depends on my mood.  Caverna feels more laid back, and is definitely more open; the options are all there for all the players, every game, rather than being dealt or drafted at the start.  One of my favourite things is that you are free to specialize here; I always feel that Agricola's capped point system pushes players to branch out and "do everything" a bit too much.  On the other hand, some players may feel that the fact that all options are available and don't vary from game to game will result in stagnation over multiple plays.

I reallllly didn't like this one when I first played it. I just for some reason didn't get it. I don't know. Then I played it again and it really shined. I now see why this gets the praise it does. It's so awesome. Agricola minus the painful feeding tension. Really ups the fun for me.

Edit: Rating increasing from 8.5 to 9. It gives me the feeling that I only get playing Terra Mystica, which is just pure strategical excitement. I'm starting to really love this game.

RATING: 6
Agricola's less brutal cousin, with starvation requiring really screwing up instead of a constant threat.  It still feels somewhat overwhelming with so many options and sub-options on the adventuring mechanic, with lots of fiddly rules to remember, like the special ability of each of the four different kinds of livestock you can own.

It was okay, but not exciting enough for me to want to play again.  I just don't get worker-placement point-salad games; it doesn't feel like it's actually modeling anything, with all the various combinations of actions and why they're exclusive just being too abstract for my tastes.

This is a well designed game with many strategic options, but is almost the same game as Agricola, Le Havre or Ora et Labora. The game is too fiddly, filling the board with resources each turn is very annoying and the game takes too long (the downtime is ridiculous). I think this game could be a better experience as a PC game.

RATING: 8
3500g of cardboard and wood. Slightly concerned my shelf will collapse. There's a lot in the box and thus the high price. All the cardboard and wood barely fits back in the enormous box. It feels like I'm getting good value for money though - lots and lots of good quality bits.

A good game in its own right, but overall it's just a tweaked and rethemed Agricola. Add adventuring, change humans into dwarves, plus a bunch of other little changes. Most of the same stuff is still there: Feeding two food per family, setting yourself up for family growth, more spots to place your family members each turn being revealed, etc.

Okay, Caverna has some really good things going for it - three standing out in particular:

1.It's a lot less stressful and forgiving than Agricola. Not a lot of brain power is spent on scraping enough food together to feed your dwarves. Instead any food shortfall is made up for with a variety of resources. So you're spending more time working out how to score points than stave off starvation.

2. The adventure mechanic is an excellent addition to the mix. Here you can pick up a variety of resources or perform actions with more choice available to dwarves who've invested more in better weapons.

3. Scoring is simplified. Gone is the band of animal and vegetable points. Each animal is now worth one point regardless of type. Wheat is half a point and vegetable one point. So again you're not wasting time thinking about whether eating an animal is going to drop you a point or not. The fiddly scoring is gone and the game is better for it.

Decisions are in no way the same as Agricola, but for the collection for most people it feels more like it'd be a one game or the other decision rather than both. I'd probably choose Caverna if I hadn't already fallen for Agricola. With Agricola I prefer the individual minor improvements and occupations over Caverna's common pool of building tiles. Games feel more different with a different set of cards in my hand each outing. I'm used to the fiddly, samey scoring too. But damn, I like those dwarf weapons and their adventures in Caverna. I like that I don't have to think quite so much in Caverna and can chill out a bit more while playing. Luckily I don't have to choose - my wife tells me I can have two girlfriends. She's a peach.

Streamlined version of Agricola, that reduces the luck factor, because all buildings are now available for all players since the beginning. The scoring system is still unintuitive, but at least it isn't as unforgiving as in Agricola.

RATING: 9
This is every bit as much fun as Agricola, one of my favorite games of all time.  I don't agree with many people who say it has replaced Agricola fully.  They really are two different games.  I give the slight edge at this point to Caverna, simply because I'm enjoying exploring the options there right now.  

Caverna Advantages:  Easier to feed your family as almost anything can be readily converted to food.  This results in a slightly less stressful experience, which some gamers will appreciate.  The questing part is pretty cool also.

Agricola Advantages:  TONS of cards to make the game different each time.  And playing with a card draft keeps players from being dealt a hand of duds.  The static setup of Caverna could possibly get old.  

Update 2/17:  When I think about whether I wan't to play Agricola or Caverna, I just have to say Agricola.  The cards just win it for me, and the extras of caverna are interesting, but not as fun as this.  Yes, I think farming is more fun than questing!

there's a lot to do in this one. too much to do in one game - and that's not a bad thing. Different strategies clearly have different roads to victory.

Seriously needs better organizers, though. thinking about buying the broken token insert. For now, using a plano to hold all the bits outside the box.

Sounds terrible
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
It turns out that it is the constraints (feeding difficulty, subsets of cards at start of game, importance of family growth, scoring etc.) that makes Agricola such an enjoyable game. With the Caverna make-over much of these are watered down or removed and the result is a playable, but overwrought product. I would much rather just play Agricola instead.

Update: Much better game than I originally gave it credit for. Agricola may be the tighter game with more built-in replayability, but there is something to be said for sometimes wanting to play a more relaxing and less cut-throat Agricola-like game.  I have reached the point where I may even prefer Caverna over Agricola.

The cards from Agricola have been replaced with cave furnishings which are open for all to buy from the begining of the game (These give you bonus options and VP's just like the cards in Agricola). No secrecy - everything is public knowledge!

Played quite a few games now (all 4, 5 or 6 player) and thoroughly enjoyed the games. I really like Agricola and this is a variant that works very well. 
The main diffference is that in Agricola you have to get the resources you need before others. In Caverna there are so many good choices the anxiety is over making the right choice!
Still not achieved 100 points in any game which is my goal!
The introduction of expeditions adds another twist and seems to be a necessary path to take to win the game as it allows you to accrue so much stuff! Never yet seen a player win without ever arming at least one dwarf ((Scrub that. I won a 5 player game without arming!))

Crucial to allow expedition accruals to be chosen while the game continues, otherwise the game takes much longer.

RATING: 7
I enjoyed this game far more than Agricola. It's much easier to feed your family, and the game feels much more open. There are actually multiple places I want to go, so if someone takes the spot I wanted (and they will), I have an alternative that still accomplishes something for me.

RATING: 9.5
One of the best eurogames in existence. It removes or improves upon everything I didn't like about Agricola, which is a great game in its own right. Caverna is relaxing and fun (which is not to say it doesn't challenge you and make you think - it certainly does) where Agricola is tense and feels like work. To each his own, but I greatly prefer Caverna.

The addition of expeditions is fantastic, and I love watching my dwarves build up their farm and dig the caverns into the mountainside. You really feel like you're invested in creating this little kingdom for them.

The component quality and artwork is first-rate, and the sheer quantity of bits makes me positively giddy.

The only downside is the long set-up and take-down time, but this can be greatly reduced with an adequate storage solution.

Highly recommended.

Agricola the Family Game: The Game, not just because there is hidden information, but also because it's much more forgiving. Resources can be converted to food anytime, it is easier to gain a Dwarf and they're worth less, penalties only for missing animals and tiles and no limit to scoring each category etc. Worked much better in practice than in theory, since I felt like I was watching the board and players instead of getting distracted by managing my hand. A slight bit of randomness in the timing of harvests in addition to the order of the action spaces so one can't script completely. Feels satisfying to watch your farm develop.

This Agricola-clone tries to change gears with rooms that do specific things as opposed to Occupations and Minor Improvements.  It also adds an adventuring mechanic, which I think is wonky, since some of your loot can be a stable?  Anyway, I didn't mind playing it and you get a lot for the $90 price tag, but the set up is a bear and I don't care for games that require you to memorize, or at least be familiar with 30-40 different tiles.  I prefer the cards in Agricola by a long stretch.  Playing Caverna confirmed for me that I don't need to buy it.

I'm a seasonal kind of guy. Such as, I like to play certain games during a specific season, and this is one of them that comes up in the Fall or early Winter. The content to this game is endless. It is a very big game with plenty of choices to make when building your farm. It's long, but it has an insane amount of substance and theme, which are two really big factors for me. I like games that tell a story, and this one allows you to create a different one every time you play. It hasn't hit our table much, but I very much plan to later in the year. It's pricy, but you get what you pay for: a quality game packed full of replayability and content.

I borrowed this game from a local store and played with my wife and twin 8-year old daughters. Everyone is very experienced with games like Catan so we felt this would be a step up.

The Good:
This game struck a nice chord.  It was just so fun to play, and had so many choices on how to develop and get to the end goal. It was fun seeing the choices everyone made on how to develop and expand, and the game stayed engaging for everyone.

The Bad:
I have 3 complaints, but they're pretty minor.

1.There are approximately 1.3 million pieces to this game, and the board has a different configuration for every different number of players. Setup and takedown were a bear, and took as long as playing a short filler game.

2. The game was very long. 3 hours for four of us to play, albeit we had some pretty young players. Nevertheless we were a bit tired out by the end.

3. While I was delighted by the plethora of choice and option, my wife often froze up with AP as she tried to work out how to proceed after actions she wanted were taken by other players.

Overall:
The good far outweighed the bad, and I would absolutely recommend this game. My family is looking forward to playing again with a bit more experience under our belts, but at the same time we're not looking forward to the long setup of the play area  :)

We enjoy all the pieces, I've bought storage boxes to minimize setup/clean up of the game.

Fantastic, fantastic game. Uwe Rosenberg is a brilliant designer. This game is exactly what you want a board game to be. The gameplay itself is fairly easy, but the decisions can be really tough. There are so many different, viable strategies presented in this game that no 2 games are ever the same. Every available action seems like something you really want to do that turn, but you can't; you just have to make difficult choices. I also love how thematic the game is as well. If you enjoy a good, thematic euro that challenges you to think, this is a must have!

Completely replaces Agricola for me.  Takes a game that feels too much like work and makes it fun.  Even new players can manage to get a lot done and feel like they have gotten something accomplished.  While it could use some additional randomness in the game setup such as additional random buildings, I just don't see any reason to ever play Agricola again.

Could have been a better game by adding some more randomness in game initialization.  I would like to have seen more buildings available in the game but just play with a random subset each time.

Did a little donkey breeding and ore mining this evening with some friends from a nearby cave. My efforts were rewarded with runner up status to my neighbor's wife, shepherd extraordinaire, 39 pts worth of sheep alone. Though it's got a lot of complexity we are really loving this refresh. Caverna is a superb Dwarven-themed re-implementation of the outstanding classic worker placement game Agricola. We upgraded most of the meeples and resources and added a Broken Token organizer to house the multitude of components, tiles and cards.

I like this more than Agricola as I feel less stressed while playing the game. Furnishing tiles replace cards, which is good and bad. Good in that there is less randomness but bad in that it can allow a scripted play. No doubt that there will be expansions released with more variety in furnishing tiles to mitigate this issue.

First off, I love the dwarf theme. So Freakin' Adorable. Second, I love the massive sandbox feel. 
I'm glad it's not as "tough" as Agricola, but I say that as someone who has only played the Agricola app. I do wish this game had the card aspect of Agricola.
I made a custom foam board to organize all the animeeples and resources, so set up happens in 10< minutes. I played three games without it before deciding something had to change, or I wasn't going to want to take this game out of the box. 
My only complaint here is that I get stuck in a rut, due to the main variable component being which round certain actions come up.

[3 plays]  This is basically a large and excellent variant of Agricola. The theme is tweaked to a land where dwarves mine, farm, and forge weapons to bloodlessly collect treasures. Feeding your population is slightly simplified. Rubies act as wild cards for other resources and foraging expeditions also act as an outlet to obtain a choice of needed resources. Card abilities from Agricola are replaced with a vast array of rooms for your cavern that grant special abilities and scoring options.

I enjoy Caverna both for its similarities to Agricola and for its unique twists. It can be both more bewildering in its choices at times and less rigid than the cards of its parent game.

This game definitely looks, feels, and plays like the second iteration of Agricola.  It streamlines several of the features, but it's still necessary to basically do everything in order to score positive points.  The theme of Agricola was fine, but I HATED the cards and how they were used in the game.  Feeding is still a concern in this game, but somewhat less so since food conversion is simplified and there are more ways to handle the food situation.  I like that all of the Furnishings are available from the start and that there is only one of each since this puts everybody on an equal footing to start, but also makes it such that all players will head down an individual and different path.  This helps make the game interesting between the players, but I'm also concerned that it enables players to basically take the same strategic route each and every time.  I guess that will be proved for disproved over time.  Overall, this game is good and I like it much more than Agricola, but I still don't love it.  The Quests is an very interesting way mitigate Action and Resources, but there are almost too many ways to do things which can lead to analysis paralysis.  I would recommend that all players new to Caverna play the Introductory game several times to learn the mechanisms and inner-workings of the game before throwing in all of the available Furnishings since that can be overwhelming and confusing.

Likes:
+ No cards!
+ Food can be converted at any time.
+ Simplified pasture/fence building.
+ Rubies (wild resources and some actions).
+ Only 1 copy of each Furnishing forces players to take different paths.
+ Not as much negative scoring.
+ Action and Resource mitigation through Quests.

Dislikes:
+ Full game with all Furnishings is a bit overwhelming to start.
+ Need to do EVERYTHING or score negative points.
+ Plays a bit too long overall.
+ Too many options/paths?

After a bad experience with 7 players soured me on the game I have had to reevaluate my opinion of this game.

The strategic depth only comes to the fore after multiple plays.  Finding the winning strategy in this sandbox is a very enjoyable puzzle to solve.

This should of been only a 2 - 5 player game.  If you are to brave 6 - 7 player games make sure everyone is very familiar with the game.  Also, everyone has to be very focused or this turns into a painfully slow game.
----------------------------------------------------------Jan 2017 play with a maximum of 5 players.  Still a great game as long as it is 2 - 5 players.

Convoluted. Adds to Agricola, which is not a good thing to do in the first place, as Agricola was enough work anyway. The dwarf theme is a bit silly, but might be liked by some (not by me though.) Probably gets better every time it is played and the more familiar one is with the game. But it would take too long to get there for me.
UPDATE: It gets better if played more often. And while I am still not particularly happy about some features, it is actually easier to play than Agricola.

I liked Agricola on my iPhone okay and was thinking it might be better with a board but then I got this on a Black Friday sale so it ended up taking Agricola's place.  Finally got a couple full (solo) games in and liked it well enough. Looking forward to a non-solo game, this has made me realize I like my solo games more ameritrashy though I do like Euros when I have others to play with.

Edit: Moving back towards solo Euros lately...guess it just depends.

After the first play, I just say I'm loving it :). There are some familiar mechanics and eating habits like in Agricola, but the adventruing, mining and rooms (instead of cards) makes it unique enough to own both this game and Agricola :)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
In direct comparison to Agricola:
+ More harvest phases but simplified food acquisition result in a much less frustrating gameplay
+ The (possibly unbalanced) hands of cards have been replaced by room tiles that are available for everyone.
+ Streamlined scoring: nearly everything is worth 1 VP and reduced/removed penalties for missing resources
+ Rubies act as a wildcard for goods, thus no actions have to be wasted to e.g. acquire that single missing stone.
+ The different buildings allow you to score a variety of goods in the endgame scoring, allowing for specialization.
+ Improved animal husbandry (dogs can herd sheep, boars can be stabled in the woods, 1 donkey per mine)

- Due to the fixed setup, there isn't a lot of variety in gameplay (limited replayability, esp. compared to Agricola)
- Not a good game for 2 players (not enough competition; some strategies are not viable, others overly powerful)
- Strategy is strongly influenced by player order

This game desperately needs some sort of random setup before it really shines.

Update: Apparently an expansion is now in development. Hopefully it will add some replayability / variance to the game.

Rosenberg megint elővette a nagy másológépét és lemásolta az Agricola szabályát pár példányban, kiegészítette pár oldallal, átcímkézte a dobozt, kicsit megnagyobbította, dobált bele még pár állatot és némi ásványt, kivette az összes kártyát és kiadta Caverna néven. Röviden ennyi Uwe új játékának története, de hosszabban se sokkal több. Újdonság az embereink vadászati tulajdonsága, amik tulajdonképpen joker akciók, ahogyan a rubin is a játékban. Sokat gondolkodtam, hogy a rubin jó vagy nem jó. Talán azért rakták bele, mert így minden helyzetből ki lehet jönni. Kicsit olyan bármire van megoldásként került bele. Nincsenek kártyák, ezzel a random faktor kisebb, cserébe rögtön van 48 fajta épület, amit meg lehet venni. Szóval sokkal több lehetőség, de emiatt nem mélyebb a játék, csak nehezebb játszani és szerintem emiatt hosszabb is jóval. Míg az Agricolában más köre alatt is tudok azon filózni a kártyáimat nézve, hogy vajon melyiket játsszam ki, itt nem tudok előre gondolkodni sokat, mert több játékos esetén nem biztos, hogy adott akció még elérhető lesz-e, mikor rám kerül a sor. Nem értem a Caverna nagy sikerét. Egyszerűen annyit csinált Uwe, hogy a mai trendnek megfelelően baromi sok lehetőséget tett a játékba, de amíg ez a Le Havre-ban a fantasztikusan zseniálisan egyszerű lépek egyet és akciózok egyet dolog mellé tökéletesen illik, itt az akciózok x törpémmel x*x-et mellé már annyi lehetőséget ad, hogy nincs esély átszámolni. Ha meg nem számolom át, akkor egyértelműen az nyer, aki gyorsabban kalkulál vagy több időt használ el a játékban. Ketten 2-2 órás volt a parti, 7-en esélytelen, hogy belátható időn belül befejeződjön. Minden előző mondatomtól függetlenül egy jól működő játék a Caverna, gyönyörű komponensekkel, érthető, szájbamagyarázó szabállyal, jó segítőlapkákkal, szép, érthető táblával, csak hát volt előtte egy Agricola és ezt nehéz felednem.

This game is the definition of "bloatware". This is [thing=31260]Agricola[/thing] with everything and the kitchen sink thrown in. And devoid of all the fantastic tension.

There was a thread recently that asked for naming the game in the top 100 that you'd refuse to play. The first game that came to my mind was [thing=15987]Arkham Horror[/thing]. Then I found out that Arkham Horror is no longer in the BGG top 100.

I went through the whole list again and came up with one name. Caverna.

This is a fun game, that most people I've played it with - love it. It is a huge game though, a lot of space needed to play it and I would recommend either buying an organiser for the pieces or making your own. However, I have one gripe with the game; I like that there is a ton of strategies you can try and use at the same time as needing to have your fingers in most of the pies as well... but most of these potential strategies seem dwarfed (!!!!) out by a few others that are easy to monopolise.. maybe I'm wrong and haven't played it enough times but it is something that keeps me away from playing it - after having lost to donkey mine strategy 10 times whilst trying to just do something a bit different.

Really fun game though!

Agricola's bigger, friendlier younger brother.  Caverna is a rich and deep worker placement game that is surprisingly intuitive once you get over the initial shock of the myriad of wood and cardboard in the very heavy box.  The neat thing about Caverna is that the various engines are interconnected, meaning that while there may be increased competition for certain components, no single component is essential for any individual strategy.  The result is a game that manages to be at once very tactical and interactive and very strategic.  The time commitment is substantial, but it's quite worth the investment.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Caverna is certainly on par with Agricola, and it feels like a redesign of it.  I like the dwarf theme, and the addition of the cave adds a lot of options to the gameplay.  The sheer amount of buildings is daunting and benefits experienced players.  The components are exceptional.  It will take quite a few plays to mine all the strategies in Caverna.

RATING: 6
This game is not only not better than Agricola but worse.

Yes it all seems better but it won't deliver the amount of variety and fun Agricola delivers with its deck of cards. The rest? Yes, I prefer Caverna for all the other bits but overall, Agricola will always be the better game and the everlasting one.

A good game still, just a failure on Mr Rosenberg's ability to improve on his games.

Enjoyed it though, and another game I would like to play again sometime when I know what I'm doing, as played vs 4 others who had all played Agricola previously (which is similar).

Many choices in the game, with the various buildings to construct, so difficult to formulate a tactic having not played previously.

RATING: 8
Initial thoughts from a single solo play: I like it!  

I had been hesitant on getting this game for the longest time, because I was convinced Agricola was the better game due to the Minor Improvement and Occupation cards.  Those cards provided a lot of variability from game to game, and gave each player individual goals to work toward.

The more I thought about it though, the with less variability from game to game, that allows players to focus their attention more on each other than trying to solve a new puzzle of MinImp/Occ cards each game.  Granted, it's not the most interactive of games, but it frees people up a little to pay attention more to what other people are doing, and makes it a little less multi-player solitaire.  Plus, Caverna feels less punishing, which in of itself makes it a more enjoyable experience.  

The solo game is a fun optimization puzzle, but sadly one that can potentially be solved, since there's no variation or randomness to it.  Despite the limited replayability, it is still a fun puzzle while trying to solve it!  My plan is to try to solve it on my own, without any help/spoilers from forum posts.

For some reason I find this a whole lot more pleasurable to play than Agricola, and I'm not certain why. Perhaps it's because there's less head-to-head fighting for the same spaces and the lack of a constant scramble for food.

This game has been (understandably) compared to Agricola, and I think I prefer it to Agricola. I feel it is less punishing, whereas I think errors/mistakes/mis-strategies in Agricola are too harshly dealt with. I also think I get the rules of this game while not fully getting all the rules of Agricola, although I'm sure that my understanding of this game benefited from having played Agricola first.

RATING: 9
Similar to Agricola, but it still has a distinctive feel all its own. The expeditions definitely give you some more options, and it seems to jump start you much more than Agricola while still maintaining quite the tension in not always having all the action spaces available. I still think that I like Agricola a bit more, because of its greater challenge, but this certainly seems like it will have greater appeal as you still always feel like you're able to be doing something.

I really like this game.  I have a lot of fun every time I play it.  There is something, that for me, is very "delightful" about playing.  I get very caught up in my little farm and my animals and organizing my little caves.  

I haven't played Agricola so I can't comment on the comparison.  If I ever get tired of my little cave farmers, perhaps I'll give it a go.

Simply blows Agricola out of the water. The removal of all those cards in favour of room tiles was a great move on Rosenberg's part. I really hated seeding the deck for the correct number of players! This game feels very streamlined and efficient without losing any of the depth Agricola had. I also enjoyed the theme immensely. It reminded me of a farming/dungeon crawling video game called Rune Factory (which, coincidently, was a huge improvement on Harvest Moon!). 

This game is a must play, must own title that should hold its replay value time and time again.

Caverna confuses me. Having played a couple of rounds at the UK Games Expo in 2014 I wanted to race out and buy it, which I basically did. I love a good Eurogame with a variety of options/tactics available to the players; I like the farming/cave building/raiding themes and feel immersed in the game when I play it. But...I just don't think it's as good as I was hoping. I would rather play Village every time than Caverna. Of course that doesn't make it a bad game because Village is great.

Rather than a new game, we have yet another refinement from Rosenberg. Basically, it's Agricola made faster and easier, and now with a vaguely fantasy theme (dwarves). I'm not the biggest fan of Agricola, although I'm getting to like it more now that I finally bought the iPad version for this trip (solo game series is pretty cool -- nicely done, Dale!). I've always found the struggle to get food a bit too much for me, and it seems like the game ends when you FINALLY get your little farm working! Maybe I'm just not a very good player? Probably. Anyway,  I prefer Le Havre and Ora et Labora. 

For me, Caverna is a good thing: I'd be happy to replace our copy of Agricola with Caverna. Or not ... whatever. But I'd certainly be willing to play Caverna again, this time actually looking at all the little building tiles in this game (which have replaced all the cards)!

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
Like Agricola, except:
- dwarves instead of humans
- you have a mountain into which you carve space used for dwellings (one/person; no upgrading) and buildings
- no cards; instead, there is a display of tiles from which EVERYONE can choose
- more animal/resource types
- harvest occurs at semi-random intervals
- can make food, at fixed ratios of resource:food, at any time
- "fighting" dwarves: used to send people on expeditions (you don't fight other players)
- slightly different point rewards for people, space, etc., and lower penalties for missing stuff; and SIMPLER scoring (most things are worth 1VP)
- less oppressive pressure to get your stuff done before someone else takes that action spot!
- more streamlined

Agricola is my favorite game.  So, as you might imagine, I was excited to play this successor looking for a similar but also different feeling experience.  To that end I was a bit disappointed.  Like the other Agricola follow-up, All Creatures Big and Small (which I completely bypassed and have never played), it got rid of my favorite part of the original game; The Occupation and Improvement cards.  And this isn't the only detail that I really don't care for in this new formula.

Behind the scenes, Caverna is just Agricola, in fact the rulebook itself tells you if you know how to play Agricola you can skip huge sections of the rulebook because they will just feel redundant.  However, where they implemented changes I feel like I dislike a lot more than I like and makes me feel completely skipping this title would have been the way to go.  But because of my love for Agricola I just felt like I couldn't.

First of all, food is a LOT easier to come by in Caverna.  Almost anything can be converted into food from the beginning of the game without the need for an oven or fireplace, food can be converted at any time, and if this wasn't enough when you build on certain spaces the game will just hand you one or two food or a wild boar as a freebie.  This takes all the tension out of a game that was fantastic because of it, not despite it.  My first game was with 5 players and everyone accelerated to 4,5, or even 6 dwarves quickly and was never struggling to feed their families.

I think the biggest goal in Caverna was to make a streamlined, easier, and ultimately more accessible Agricola.  I already mentioned at the top of my comments that they removed all the cards from the game, much like they did in All Creatures Big and Small, this is egregious in my opinion.  The best part of Agricola was the endless variety and variability the game had that presented new ways to play each time and never had the game feeling old.  Removing the cards is like removing the game's soul.  But what baffles me is they clearly removed them, again like All Creatures Big and Small, to make the game more accessible but they replaced the cards with 47 individually unique tiles.

This is clearly more overwhelming to new players than 7 each of occupation and improvement cards.  There is an introductory game side that uses a lot less buildings but come on, no competent gamer wants to play the introductory game.  Have you played the family game of Agricola, it's horrendous and boring because it ALSO removes the cards, the best part of the game.  And while adding a ton more variety of options in these different tiles to a single game of Caverna it also removes a ton of variety and replayability from the game overall.  There may have been 47 different furnishings to buy but after seeing them in one game I already know what they are and have an idea of what is and isn't good in what situation.  Not only that but having them all available to all players every game they can pick and choose a strategy and better ones will usually be dominant as opposed to the brilliance of having to make the different cards you got every game work for you and being able to play the game differently every time.

Now the one thing I did quite enjoy with Caverna is the new expedition mechanic.  In Caverna you can equip your dwarven family members with weapons and go on expeditions to bring back items.  The better your weapon the more and better stuff available for you to bring back with you.  This is an interesting new layer to the game that works really well.  There's even an opportunity cost to higher level dwarves since they always need to be played last and the best spaces for them may be gone by then.

Overall Caverna is a big disappointment and anyone who accuses me of wanting it to be something it isn't is blind if they don't think this was MEANT to be compared side-by-side with Agricola.  So much of the game is actually just copied and pasted and they tried to make a game with wider appeal to get more people playing it and, I'm sure, make more money.  And honestly, that's what makes me quite enjoy this game despite it's shortcomings.

What?!  After all that criticism I like it.  The problem with Agricola is that, for example what I see as exquisite tension in trying to find a food engine to feed my family every turn many others see simply as a stressful and brutal game experience.  To that end I don't get to play Agricola NEARLY as much as I would like to.  This game still has a lot of Agricola in it and there's more I like about the game besides the tension and huge variety of cards.  Plus it does have more appeal to a broader audience so if I want that kind of a game fix, I'm more likely to get this played than Agricola.  For those reasons I think it has legs and this gigantic box also has a spot on my shelf.

RATING: N/A
Comparing this game to Agricola is mandatory as they are similar in many aspects but that's not necessarily a bad thing, mainly because I'm a huge Agricola fan. That said, I can only be (again) a huge Caverna fan.

The production is amazing. I've played with 4 players only (which seems to be the hot spot) but the game can get the 7 player experience!!! The wooden bits are great and so are all the counters, individual and common boards.

Rules are more streamlined and there are a few advantages over its predecessor, like all buildings are displayed giving each player the same possibilities of getting them, unlike the cards in Agricola which may unbalance the game giving more or less luck.

I would prefer Agricola in 2 main aspects. The first one being the cards for the opposite reason on why players may prefer Caverna. Each time one plays an Agricola game the feeling is different depending on the cards you get. This means that, despite there are many reasons to play Caverna lots of times, obviously it's more closed than Agricola as it has fewer building options. The second reason why I prefer Agricola is related to the different stages that each player is at during the game, depending on the type of house one has at a giving moment. For me it's one of the most interesting things in Agricola as one player may be playing in the wood state, another in the clay state and even a third one playing in the stone state, thus making the gameplay quiet diverse from player to player in different stages during play.

Overall and once again, a great game by Uwe. Commercially a huge success too, which is also a reason to congratulate the publisher(s), Lookout Games mainly.

I was not going to buy a copy then saw a damaged box and negotiated. Looks like Gric with whistles on - loads more actions, more animals, expeditions,  currency ('rubies') and loads of tiles open to all...Going to take some time to get my head round the increased options

---------

1st play 4 players 2 hours.

1st impression is that this,in my fave Rosenberg since Le Havre. The choices are many but the conversion of resources into Vps is not too convoluted as his other recent games. Very much a hair let down Agricola variant. 

-------

2nd &s3rd play. 2 players

Preferred with 4, perhaps a little too much freedom and surfeit of resources in 2 player. I enjoyed it but preferred the claustrophobia with 4. Still enjoyable.

--------

4th play with 3 players - must unlearn 'Agricola' - and remember that VPs for things you are eating is not clever

9 plays - 6 2 player. I prefer playing with more than 2 (that is still very enjoyable) because there is more competition for tiles and I am forced to approach the game in a different way

12 plays. 2 player engagement waning compared to 'gric. 

Because Caverna allows specialisation  you have a broader, and the extra resources and currency allows combos and extreme positions  to flourish . I do feel replay ability is limited to exploring strategic paths at different player counts. Gric' provides a unique tactical hand management challenge which I have not tired of after over 100 plays. 

--------------

17 plays. Replay ability will now come from different player counts. 4 > 3 > 2. And. I suspect 5 ,6 and 7 even more interesting - but  down time might outweigh the benefits.
(Though that time would have to be spent thinking about plans y- z as others take stuff afore you) Wondering if there might be some mileage for smaller numbers in a quasi-draft, or randomly restricting the number of tiles?

---------------

Caverna better than Gric because it allows specialisation? no finding balance is just an interesting a goal as maxing out in one or tow areas.plus there is specialism in gric - it's just a little more subtle and about the food engine.

-----------------

Often a great food engine is as good as a bonus point tile - if feeding is in the bag then you can enclose, take mines, take gold.  

-----------------

After 19 plays only really interested in 4 player + and an expansion. 

5 player tighter, and you must look sharp ish if you want to get the tiles you need. That's the only real experience difference.

Not often does a game skyrocket as quickly to the top 5 of my all-time favorite games as did Caverna after playing it a grand total of...one time! I've since played many times, and I am in love.  

Caverna has the perfect amount of variations to win. Do you focus heavily on planting and harvesting crops along with breeding animals out in the open? Do you concentrate your valuable (and limited) actions to dig deep underground, creating caverns, ore mines, and even a rare ruby mine? Do you invest heavily in weaponry to reap the awesome loot that comes from high-level weapons? Do you horde rubies to instantly turn them into valuable goods? Or do you plan a coordinated, balanced strategy to maximize your return on investment? I've seen every one of those tactics win.  

Here are a few random and fun small-scale things that I love about Caverna that will be particularly intriguing to those who have played Agricola: the dogs can "watch" sheep in open meadows without a fenced-in pasture; you can store a single donkey in each underground, unfurnished cavern; there is some randomness embedded with the harvest (you don't always know if there will be a harvest or not); you can store a single boar in a forest space with a stable; lastly, you can convert animals and harvested grain/vegetables into consumable food immediately! There are many other reasons why I prefer Caverna to Agricola, but these are just a few. 

Another awesome aspect is the furnishing of caverns. Don't overlook them! Once you build a cavern, you can "customize" it to suite your particular strategy and reap many benefits immediately, over several rounds, or at the end of the game. For example, one furnishing gives you one coin per two sheep at the end of the game. Another gives you one ruby for each of the next several rounds. Another gives you discounts on subsequent furnishings or pastures. There are many combinations of furnishings that can provide powerful enhancements to your gameplay. 

Set-up and take-down are a bit of a beast. There are, as I count it, 43 different types of playing pieces, tiles, boards, cards, and tokens for a grand total of 851 individual items (not including the cards) in a 9-pound box . But don't let that deter you! It is well worth it. The gameplay itself moves along at a good pace, and after a couple of games, you can keep the time under the estimated 30 minutes per player. 

Overall, I give this game a resounding 9.5 out of 10. I've never given a full 10 before (I'm saving it for that one special game!), but this is as close as I've come!

RATING: 3
This game may have more options than it's predecessor Agricola, but it takes the worst part of Agricola (the panic to feed your people and makes it even more frequent.  "Hell," they say "why not make it so that a few rounds are random and you won't know if you have to feed your people or not?  We'll even make it so that in one of those rounds you can either breed your animals OR harvest your crops!  How do you like them apples?  You don'T  Because you can't harvest them!"

This game feels like you are having your head held under water and your are fighting go breathe.  Eventually, you do find that you grow gills, because you have to, but it is not an experience that I wish to repeat.

Man, I love this game! This gives me the same feeling as Agricola, but is different enough so it's not just another Agricola. I think my rating will still go up (three plays so far: one two-player game, one five-player game and one three-player game).

Picking a copy of up off the shelf at the store feels like it should come with some bit of fanfare. Just a small, musical theme hinting at grandiose finales to help imprint the moment in your mind. The game is weighty, coming in at a hefty 10 lbs. letting you know immediately that this is Uwe Rosenbergs flagship and the game feels like it is a pinnacle effort with its Agricola roots and its beautifully rendered components.
The game plays a lot like its revered predecessor, offering streamlining in some key areas, and adding some more options in its expeditions and the caverns side of the player board. The expeditions add another option for players to use to gain access actions that might be limited on the main board but at the expense of having to level up those explorers to a point where they are capable of provided those services to your growing family. This pretty much set the tone for the entire game.
All of the strategies in the game are very much so a practice in give and take. Wanna be a rancher and raise animals? Then you probably aren't going to own a crib worthy of MTV's Cribs. Wanna be a hero adventurer? Have at it, but you probably aren't going to have a huge farm full of wheat and veggies. The game allows for at most one good sideline in addition to your main strategy, but the need to feed your dwarves, fill up the player board, and get enough animals together not to be penalized in points at the end of the game will override any other side strategy you might want to invest in.
All in all, the game is a blast. Easily one of my favorite games I've played this year. Despite its high entry price, the game delivers on many levels and I have a feeling I'll work working to try to earn more and more points in it for years to come. 10/10

Take Agricola and remove all important decisions and depth and add a bunch of new unnecessary rules and you have caverna. 

Sure it's not a punishing but that doesn't make it better. Shallow and bloated, might be talked into playing if someone already set it up and there isn't much else to play.

I wish this game had a little less going on when teaching a new player. It's a great game that has all kinds of bits, so at the end of the game the player boards are all different and covered in colourful bits. 

The first solitaire play through resulted in and overwhelming number of sheep due to a misinterpretation of the breeding rules... 2-98 sheep = 1 lamb, NOT 20 sheep = 10 lambs... the board did look pretty ridiculous.

It's actually better than Agricola but my desire to play is lower.
It's pretty much the same rehash game by Rosenberg. Doesn't he gets tired of designing the same game with little variant (and doesn't players get tired of buying the same stuff with minor changes).
Anyway, this is fiddly (just filling the board each turn makes me want to play something else), theme is boring (cave farmer, really?), zero interaction (you are never really block in anything), it's long (anybody tried it with 7 players?!?) and pricey.
I wonder how many trees it takes to make this game.

The best successor to Agricola yet! You go, Uwe!  An 8 on the first play, a 9 on the second.  The feeling that you're getting to do so much more on each turn than you're used to doing on an Agricola turn makes the speed of Caverna seem exhilarating.  Most of the squares where you send your dwarves (what we called family members in Agricola) give you two rewards at once.  For example, take this piece of grain AND clear two squares of forest; take this pile of stone AND dig a tunnel and a cavern on the mining side of your board.  You can get vegetables and grain or sheep and donkeys making food for you in nothing flat.  So... how do you wield this great power?

I'm possibly a little disappointed on my first play, but I really liked it.  I was hoping it'd be my new greatest game ever given the ratings on this site, but I'm not sure if I like it any more than Agricola (which admittedly is a lot.)  I'm looking forward to more plays, though I'll have to leave a lot of extra time for setting it up and putting it away.

I went ahead and bought it, and on a second play it got even better.  The addition of plano boxes made setup a lot easier.

It's a great Euro / midget-placement game. Enough different paths to have a fabulous evening again and again.
Winning, at least to me, is not the main motivation for playing. Everything around 100 points looks just beautiful. 
The cow + milking parlor combo seems a bit overpowered. Have to try the bummy-dwarf and try to collect as many dogs as possible, yet.
Now upgraded with dwarfs from the "Kinder-Überraschungsei"!
Soo, so good!

Good theme play!  Fairly easy to learn but it will take a few games to develop strategies.  Game play offers many choices, but minimal player interaction.  The components are very good - colorful mounted boards, tons of wood playing pieces, tons of thick tiles and somewhat durable cards with fair artwork.  Rulebook is not well organized.  Game length is too long with many players.

RATING: 1
If I could give it a zero and it would mean something I would. Way over priced and over chromed especially adding in 5-7 players. This must have just been done to justify that price. Watching 6 other players AP over upturned tiles, then getting blocked only to be able to easily work around it is a snooze feast. I'm not sure why feeding was added to the game given how easy it is, just a minor nuisance in the game.

Would be rated 9 if it wasn't so long with a full group of players.
Getting the printable copy of all the tiles for players to mark off as they are bought is invaluable for large groups/large tables where it is difficult to see the text on the small tiles from a distance.

I like this even more than Agicola.
The additional cards in Agricola make for more variation but also for more volatility, which has decreased that game's appeal heavily to me.
Caverna does not have that volatility while still providing a sufficient number of roads to victory.

My best Multi-player score: 111 points.)

RATING: 6.75
Fun game but lacks the tension that I feel when playing Agricola. It is fairly easy to feed your people (converting resources is easy) and it is hard to block someone's actions (multiple spots for the same thing and the "mimic" action which kills nearly all tension in the game). The adventuring questing thing is also a bit strong in that a few people have to do that every game and whoever gets first dibs on it will do much better than others.

Plus, the lack of randomness in buildings and lack of "variable player powers" leaves it feeling dry. There's also a lot of fiddliness with some of the rules, like dogs can hold sheep and stabled woods can hold boar but you need to clear the woods for any other animal? Weird.

Want to play it a few more times before I finalize my opinion, but right now Agricola + expansion (removing Occupations) is by far better.

The only thing that I like about Caverna more is the struggle in waiting to place workers with weapons (since it goes from lowest weapon to highest) which is really interesting. Oh, and the scoring is a lot easier and more forgiving which is kind of nice (never liked how workers gave 3 points in Agricola when they also give more actions -- it is like a double whammy that you need to max out on workers).

This game just slightly edged out Agricola for me but ultimately, despite similar mechanisms, the strategy is almost polar opposites. You get more choices in how you want to play and you can experiment with different specializations. Definitely room in my collection for both Agricola AND Caverna.

Update of Agricola, better in most respects but there is far too much choice, so as to cause analysis paralysis. Instead of choosing cards from a small choice as in Agricola you have all the lots of cards available to all players all the time (until they're taken).

A little time consuming to set up, and a little time consuming to put away, but otherwise beautiful in every way. I've had fun teaching this game to my friends, and I've even gotten newer gamers to play it AND have fun with it despite its heaviness (figurative heaviness, though the box is also pretty heavy). Yeah, it can be a pain to get it set up and even find the room to play it, but the actual game itself is just pure fun.

A few (okay, quite a few) things:

1. Though I would classify this as a medium-heavy Euro, it has little to do with rule complexity and more to do with depth. Caverna's rules, though they are long, are incredibly intuitive with reminders everywhere- your board tells you how much gold is needed to purchase resources, and how much food those resources make, while the individual actions on the board tell you almost everything you need to know about that action. The furnishings can be a little too much for some people, so stick with the "family" version that more or less halves the amount of rooms available until everyone is ready for even more depth. 

2. People who liked Agricola's card drafting will not get the exact same experience. There are no individual goals written for you on the cards- you have to create your own goal. Many fans of Agricola claim this makes the game stale and limited in it replay-ability. I would say that this is only true if you personally decide to pick the same strategy over and over again. Yes, the lack of cards means that there is a certain series of actions for each game that would end up being the "best", however if you decide to look up what these are or spend the hours required to figure them out by staring at the 7 different player iterations of the board, then you are only spoiling it for yourself- besides, outside of the solo game, people will block your strategy at some point. If you decide to go the grain route and build the beer parlor every single game, then yeah, it's going to get stale. Mix it up for yourself, try a different strategy. It doesn't have to be stale, it's only as stale as you make it, I mean SERIOUSLY there are a TON of different avenues to pursue. The world of Caverna is your oyster.

3. Keep in mind the company you keep. Even though this sits in the medium-heavy euro category, this game could appeal to casual gamers more easily than competitive gamers (possibly because of the reasons in paragraph 2 above). The thing with Caverna to remember is that it really doesn't matter if you win or not- it just feels good to be at the end of the game and see what you've built and see what your neighbors have built. Everyone will play this game differently- some will be very competitive and block you at every junction, while others will go on their merry way harvesting and re-sowing vegetables all day long. Too many competitive gamers may make the game too stressful, while too many casual games might make the game feel too solitaire. This is something that's true for almost every board game out there, the only thing to keep in mind is that, as good as this game is, it doesn't eliminate either problem (and I can't think of a game I've played or seen that can).

4. I will say that, for 100 dollars, you could maybe get a few other great games instead from Coolstuff or Amazon. I wouldn't ever say this game isn't worth 90 dollars, but I will say that you should try and get it as cheap as you can without compromising the integrity of the box and its components- I got it for 62 dollars from Coolstuff, and, hell, 28 dollars is almost enough for another game!

5. When choosing between this and Agricola for my game collection (And you could argue there's room for both), Caverna won out almost entirely because of theme. Caverna, I'm sure it has been said, is very close to Minecraft in a board game- mining caves, getting ore, raising animals, farming, harvesting, etc. This appeals to people, I've found, more often than "you're a couple trying to raise a farm". Don't underestimate the power of the Dwarven, Minecraft-y theme, as it will peak the interest of others who would otherwise be more reluctant to play with you.

6. Finally, I implore you to actually TALK to the people you're playing with. This game requires a lot of thinking to do well, sure, but any down time (and often there isn't too much of it) is a good time to make up stories for your dwarves and their lifestyle. "Why do you have all your dwellings in the front and then the one dwarf kid has his bed in the back of the cave?" "You know how it is. 'It's just a phase' he tells me." This game is made way more fun if you talk and make up a bit of a story every now and then of your dwarf family's lives. Again, this is something I try to do with all of my board games during down time- too often I find playgroups who dislike certain games because they're too afraid to converse during down time, which is strange to me since board games are meant for you and those around you to TALK. Otherwise it'd just be a clunkier video game you have to have friends over to play.

Is this game for everyone? Probably not. Should you buy it? Look up what people have to say about this versus Agricola to see which you'd prefer. Quite a few people say this game is trash compared to Agricola, so maybe they know more than me. This one, however, has a place in my game collection for eternity.

Pros:
+Components are perfectly done- mostly wooden but also high-stock cardboard pieces.
+Game boards and cards have beautiful artwork and are also very durable.
+DEEP strategy between the furnishings and the different actions possible.
+Fun, appealing theme.
+A good sense of having done something by the end. Great for lovers of resource collection or building games.
+Plays 1-7.
+Requires you to actually think.

Cons:
-Literally heavy
-7 player game might be tedious (haven't tried), but there's enough components in there for 7 (The game could have easily been for 6 or even 5 and would still get played almost as often by about everyone who owns it). Hence, why it's so heavy, and also why...
-As a result of having so many components, set up/put away time is quite long [~10-15 minutes each] (though can be shortened greatly by cooperation... which you wont get in a solo game).
-Somewhat AP susceptible, but with more players often turns will be planned out.

All the cons mentioned have little to do with the actual game, which I find to be nearly perfect. Despite all my quibbles, Caverna gets a 10.

*Minor edit* I've found set up/put away time can be decreased significantly by keeping each resource and tile type in their separate bags (the game comes with plenty of plastic bags to use at your leisure). This works better for me than dumping them out and putting them back at the end.

Agricola pozitív felfogásban. Agricolában azon kell stresszelni, hogy meglegyen minden vagy majdnem minden, tudjak etetni. A Cavernában van minden bőségben, sőt "másolásra" is van lehetőség, azaz egy más által már elfoglalt akciót végrehajtani. Itt a stresszt a minél jobban használjam ki és vajon elég jól használtam-e ki érzés adja.
Nevezhetnék: Agricola+ nak is. Nekem jobban bejön, csak sokat kellene vele játszani, hogy igazán jól stratégiázhasson benne az ember.

RATING: 7.6
Solid game. Reiterates Agricola but does away with the cards. That is both an upside (less reading, more playing) as a downside (no variety in setup, risk of favorite strategy lock-in). Also a little friendlier and scoring is easier.

Components are superb, solo play is good as well and there are much, much more choices at any time as in Agricola which is nice if you felt constricted for choice in that game. Another plus is the variety from player count to player count: each player count has it's own set of starting actions available, so the game will differ with each player count.

In short: a huge action space and variability by player count does lessen the pre-set nature of it all but it is still there (favorite lock-in strategies). So with repeated plays with the same group this game might become stale earlier as Agricola.

That being said, an expansion is on the way which probably adds a lot of modular expansions and at least one variable setup (don't know if it does but would be surprised if it would not).

Which game is better? Tough to say. Not burned out on the strategy of Caverna by a long shot, so for now I drift towards it a little more as towards Agricola. In the long run, I see Agricola taking back its spot as it is more variable. But the expansion changes all that and I'm fairly sure I won't hit saturation level with Caverna before that, so for the moment it is Caverna.

For new players this is definitely a friendlier game to pick up, but they need to be experienced gamers as the action space is pretty large. All the playing pieces do really give you a sense of tableau-building, having your nice little farm/cave. My kids loved that feeling, even though the actual game went way over their head. As such, it is a lot of work for dad so not something I'm really eager to break out with them again. Then again, if they request it, how can I say no?

A really good update from Agricola. Now you can specialize much more, you are not victory points capped at 4 cows, 6 pigs, 6 vegetables, etc. Now you can get all your points from sheep, or grain, or rubies, or or or or or. There are so many options you can go for, and they removes the random cards you get dealt in agricola (professions and buildings).
More harvest, you are no longer forced to have max workers in order to win the game.
Overall frees up many options that you could not do in agricola. A very fun game.

After having played a Feast for Odin enough times to feel comfortable leaving a review, I still crown Caverna the champion of the Rosenberg collection, with Fields of Arle, Agricola and a Feast for Odin duking it out in a very close contest for #2-4 respectively.  I haven't yet solidified those positions, and may settle on AFfO in the eventual #2.  Nonetheless, Caverna sits atop the list in the Rosenberg collection.

RATING: 8.5
Few, I finally got to play the big one, the perceived nr 1 from last years Essen.
Let me start by reminding you that I like [thing=31260][/thing], but I prefer to play it without the cards. My favorite [person=10][/person] game is actually [thing=35677][/thing]. And I chose that last tile over Agricola every single time. Which is why I don't play Agricola almost ever. Which is why I didn't get Caverna. I wasn't ready to fork out all that money for a game that is based on a game that I like a lot, but never play because an other game just pleases me a lot more.
Caverna does away with the cards and replaces them with a fixed set of buildings that are available to everyone. This will reduce the variability between games, but since I don't play with the cards in Agricola that often, that probably won't bother me in the long run. The biggest difference for me, therefore, was the vastly simplified scoring. A few other things have been streamlined as well.
At heart this game is very similar, but it's not just more of the same. It is a very solid game in it's own right. And the buildings and different strategic possibilities, still offer a very good amount of replay value I expect.
So, do I like it more than it's predecessor? One play isn't enough to know that, but I do like it quite a bit. I don't expect this game to kick Le Havre from it's nr 1 spot for me though.
Production wise this game is top notch, just like all Lookout titles. But why oh why did they include all that material that I'll never use? We play with mostly 3 or 4 players, almost never more. So I'm paying a lot of good money for cardboard that is of no value to me. That is a very sad thing, because I expect this to be the case for most people.

Before we played someone said this is "Agricola light". I can't even imagine Agricola after playing this. Too many decisions, never knew what to do, didn't have fun playing. Usually when I play a game for the first time at the end I've got it down and know what I did wrong or could of done better. Not with Caverna. Plus it took three plus hours for five players. Never again. (Note: They said if I didn't like this I wouldn't like Terra Mystica. I had no idea it was the same genre. I have that rated as a one. So yeah, they were correct)

I agree that this game is a more streamlined remake of Agricola, which addresses some people's concerns with Agricola.  But honestly, I don't think it's any better, and in fact is a lot worse. 

It hits you a little harder with the buildings than Agricola does.  Since you are competing with everyone in a big pool for what's available, so the paralysis of what to do with regards to buildings is much much higher.

You could technically do the same thing in Agricola with the Occupations/improvements.  Well most of them anyway.

I think Caverna might handle higher player counts a tad better than Agricola, but they are both going to be long games with lots of players.  I think I'm still in the 2 or 3 player only tree on both of the games, just for time reasons.

I like Agricola more.

You have all 48 buildings from the start of the game. This give a much variety for many games, but 48 buildings is not 300 cards from Agricola. When you want to play in the same way you could do this.

Some actions are very similar, so you can`t block the opponents. There is always another way to get what you want.

The harvest is more offen than in Agricola, but it is no problem to get food. 

In this game you maximize your points. I miss the pressure like in Agricola.

31-Mar-2014: Well, I can safely say that Caverna is not Agricola. It's strange that Agricola and ACB&S taught us the rules to Caverna. I mean, most of the stuff going on is what we've learnt from before. i.e. Harvests, Feeding family members, what Wood 2 (1) means, etc.

The interesting bits are the randomly allocated Harvest indicators at the end of rounds 6+. So you know that there are about 4 more Harvests coming, but you're not sure when exactly after Roound 6. The "Expeditions" are interesting as well. Each dwarf member can carry a Weapons Token valued between 1-15. It's a little cardboard disc shield that sits on top of your dwarf disc. If you choose an Action space with an Expedition symbol with a dwarf that is armed with a Weapons Token, you get some extra resources based off your Weapon Token value. So it's cute to see your dwarf discs with little weapons on them.

But what's missing, really, is the angst. Although there are more Harvests, Carverna sports even more ways to get Food and simpler ways to build food engines. I built a single Room that gave me +1 Food for each animal I slaughter for Food. Note that you can slaughter animals for Food at any time, similar to how Grain and Vegies are converted to Food in Agricola (i.e. no Stove requirement)
My single room became my Food engine for the rest of the game.

Most of us were hardly in any position to starve. The fixed number of buildings available also lent the air of Puerto Rico buildings. Eventually, you'll get familiar with all the buildings and will try out various strategies around different buildings.

But that simply can't contend against the vast number of Minor Improvements and Occupations that Agricola has.
To me, Caverna was a nice game, but I don't feel the need to own it immediately. Perhaps a few years down the line, if I score a cheap copy.

In conclusion - it's hard to do badly in Caverna. Angst is missing. But it's still a good worker placement game.

A gentler version of Agricola. Unfortunately that means it doesn't quite have the expansive collection of options that Agricola has. It takes a little too long for the resource-management-worker-placement game that it is. There's not even really any deep engine building that I can see, which I suppose is good; it's just a matter of spending actions in the right way to get the resources you need when you need them, rather than racing for the engine components so you can just churn for the second half of the game.

First off, this is very similar to Agricola - to the point where the rules were designed so that if you know Agricola, you are told (in the rulebook) what you need to read to understand the game and what sections you can skip. That being said, this is better than Agricola. 

There is less variability since there are not stacks of cards (I suspect there will be new tiles in an expansion). There is more freedom and less PENDING DOOM feeling the whole game. And yet it is still Agricola v2. If you were "meh" about Agricola, you'll probably enjoy this. If you hated Agricola, then you may not like this.

Agricola 2.0.  I like everything they added like mining, dogs, and adventuring.  I like the theme and love the art and components.  But, the additions are not enough to overcome the loss of the minor improvement and occupation cards.  I never appreciated just how much those cards add to the game until they took them away.  If 'Gric didn't exist this would be an 8, but I can't see ever wanting to play this over 'Gric.

RATING: 9.3
For some reason I love playing this game while drinking wine. It looks grandiose, but plays quite simply. The open 'sandbox' eliminates a lot of the tension but makes it fun to fiddle with different strategies, and there is still tension over the worker placement spots. I like how unused spots become more tempting over time as they accrue more resources, and more spots also open up as the game goes on. It's also a great feeling when I manage to pull off a brand new strategy I hadn't tried before, as in many games I often get stuck in a rut of a strategy that I am used to, but Caverna for some reason invites me to try new things, and that's one of the reasons I love coming back to it. Plus, it's just a great, fun game, with a ton of variety and literally heaps of choices.

Lots of the same mechanisms as Agricola but with more options, streamnlined feeding, and card randomness removed.  I like it, and enjoy with my game group, although I'm not sure it's varied enough to get regular play.  And there's way too much going on for me to see this as a family game.

RATING: 7
EDIT: Changed my mind.  The cards in Agricola make it so much better.  This game is fine, but not on par with many of the others above it on my ranking list.   

ORIGINAL COMMENT:
This game is just as good as Agricola, but I think the two games fit different types of players.  I would play Caverna with a group that dislikes aggressive blocking or intense maximization.  Caverna feels more fluid and carefree in terms of gameplay compared to the nervous apprehension in Agricola (which I enjoy, but some may not).  Agricola I would play with a highly competitive group who want to maximize every action they take. In both games you can set yourself up for great actions that feel like an accomplishment, but in Agricola it is much easier to get blown out by opponents blocking you or simply poor planning. The highly competitive group would also enjoy maximizing Caverna, but it is much more friendly to beginners due to the abundance of action spaces and resources. 
I love both games and I feel like their styles are different enough to warrant owning both.

Good game, though I still prefer Agricola. Caverna lets you do whatever you want and adds more options, which is obviously good, but takes away a lot of the tension that made Agricola so great for me (and so infuriating for others). The real problem here are the buildings : there are a lot of them that you have to keep in mind, for an overall replay value that is less than what Agricola's cards brought to the table.

A solid game, but overshadowed by its older brother.

A very, very preliminary rating. Caverna has extraordinary depth, but seems a tad more fiddly than I'd like (more fiddly than Agricola, when I would expect this sequel to me more streamlined than its predecessor). I love the expedition mechanics and concept, and I'm glad to see that they are viable but not essential as a winning strategy. More familiarity with the improvements may help alleviate my concerns about the fiddly nature of this sprawling game. It's certainly interesting enough that I will put in the extra plays to find out.

Uwe Rosenberg's sequel to Agricola. I was almost expecting it to be bad, because of the quality of the game it was going to be compared to. But actually, it's really good.

I wouldn't want to say it's better than Agricola, but it differs quite a bit from the more recent Rosenberg designs Le Havre and Ora&Labora in that it doesn't turn into a cube conversion frenzy. Most of the cave rooms are built with stone and/or wood solely. This reduced resource system sort of simplifies the game with the game being far far far from simple. There is such a plethora of options for each and every turn that it is quite overwhelming during a first game but I admit that I like intuitive playing rather than attempting to solve a game. It expands on Agricola with a tile-laying element and the "quests" plus some animal keeping specialties. It takes away the abundance of possible card constellations you're being dealt, But I wouldn't worry about replayability the tiniest bit. Like I mentioned before: the game provides you with tons of options every turn and you cannot nearly do all the stuff you would want to do. I like all of these mechanics, especially the mechanic of crafting "weapons" for your dwarfs and sending them out on "quests". But just like I'm amused about the namecalling in Lords of Waterdeep I'm amused here. Don't expect any dungeon/ Cave crawler atmosphere. This one's got Euro written all over it. In fact, it's got "Very good Euro" written all over it.

After 5+ hours session with 6 players: this takes much too long, there is no tension, zero player interaction, a boring experience. Best example of a multiplayer solitaire. I love Agricola, but Caverna misses everything what makes Agricola such a good game. No tightness at all; there is always an option to choose from; every player is occupied with optimizing his own board, without looking at other players' boards; no need for fighting for starting player position; way too many bits,...

If I want to solve a puzzel, I'll buy a genuine one, and for much less than 70 Euro.

Not played yet, but from what I've seen, this will replace Agricola completely. Agricola is one of my favorite games, but this adds a ton more options, makes it much easier and less important to feed your family, and now you can really explore different ways to score points instead of having to accomplish the same tasks in every game. It also gets rid of the player-specific cards and adds buildings that everyone can buy. The cards were nice, but they could really sway the game in favor of one player. The buildings seem more fair to everyone. Can't wait to get my copy.

Update: Played a couple of times now and I love it so far.

'Fairy Pond' expansion included. To be honest, I didn't get to bring this out at all. At. All. Group was pretty intimidated by the sheer size and the fact it was a upgrade to Agricola. I hope this finds a better home and give it some attention rather than sitting on a shelf looking pretty.

I really like the cards in Agricola. I think they're what make the game so great. Here, the cards are replaced by buildings that are available to everyone at the beginning of the game. And even though there are a lot of buildings, I just don't feel like every game is a tense adventure, as I do in Agricola. There are so many paths to points here that if someone takes your plans, it's no big deal really. You just have to look for another option. It won't be far.

It's still a marvelous design. But I think Agricola is still the master of worker placement.

Excellent meaty euro that is a great streamlining of the Agricola system that also introduces more variety. The play time is quite long and often you can get bogged down with every decision but the game is engaging and satisfying. I think 5 players is the max I would play with as any longer the downtime would be too much but would highly recommend this for people who enjoy thinky euros.

After one play it feels like a sprawling more forgiving Agricola, which I guess is exactly what it is supposed to be.  

I feel that Agricola is still the tighter more rewarding experience.  But it is refreshing to not sit there knowing if you get blocked on bake bread your entire family is going to starve and your whole strategy is toast.

If you liked Agricola, but didn't like getting heart palpitations from losing the action you need, this is for you.  There's always something good to do, everything can be converted to food (delicious raw Donkey!) and you are never backed too badly into a corner.

One of the best WP out there. It offers an impressive number of strategies you can try, tight competition for action spaces, all wrapped in a delightful theme and cute components.

The expeditions, while working great mechanically, are quite fiddly.

I absolutely love the multiple 'actions' per action space. It encourages variety, yet, the building encourage specializing, balancing out the two aspects is key to winning.

Caverna is clearly a brilliant design. There are interesting decisions to make at every turn and countless ways to score serious points. The worker placement mechanic prevents the "multi-player solitaire" feel as you're constantly trying to anticipate your opponent's preferred moved and/or blocking what would be an ideal play for them.

A game very, very obviously in the same vein as Agricola.  Seems a little more "fun" to me, but haven't played enough to have a strong opinion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
First Impression:

A "sister" game to Agricola, with a surprisingly different "character".

This game at first glance appears deceptively similar to Agricola. Both are worker placement games with a puzzle aspect, and the designer did little to hide the core mechanics.

However, based on how different they play, the target two distinct sub-audiences in the euro genre.

Here's a brief summary of the gameplay differences:
1) Caverna is not nearly as tight and mean as Agricola. Feeding is a breeze, as if starting Agricola with 4 kids eating half the food and a super fireplace already build. Actually, it's even easier than that.
2) In Caverna you never struggle for resources, filling your farm or getting this and that. You can achieve everything easily, even in your first game. The question is how efficiently you'll fill your farm and how much you'll manage to accumulate (there is no "upper limit" in anything). The reason for that is that, 
3)appart from the super easy feeding, there are two joker categories in the game, rubies and expeditions that can be used to do just about anything and a bit more. And mind you these are not just a couple of action spots, these are the core elements of the game and take up half the board.
4) The actions spots are all double (or triple or more) compared to agricola and as a result, there is no such thing as blocking in Caverna. For example there are three spots for plowing in Caverna straight from the start (4p game) compared to 1(+1 in late game) in Agricola. And plowing in those actions is not the only thing you do, actually it's 1/3 of the action. And that is without counting the jokers. Unless you choose to fail in a category, the minus points written on the scoring sheet are nothing but decorative.
5) Another consequence of the multi-action action spots is that they increase the complexity. This is great news for those who love to count points 4 times their turn, but for me it just creates serious downtime for no reason. Playing one dwarf in Caverna is like playing 2-4 workers back to back in Agricola but masquerated to make it look like it was just one - but a ninja. 
6) In Agricola one look at another player's farm got you all the info you needed to see if he's doing well, if not and most importantly what he needs (to maybe block it). In Caverna you have no idea, everyone is so full that unless you pause to start counting donkeys you have no clue who's ahead. And basically, since there is no blocking and no risking, you have no reason to bother. Caverna is five steps closer to multiplayer solitaire which is great news for some, and terrible news for me.
6) In Agricola you have a small common pool of very important major improvements, and 7+7 private cards that differ from game to game. In Caverna every game is similar to the next, but there are some 50 rooms to choose from straight from the beginning. The difference is mind blowing. Agricola is easier to play and at the same time very replayable. Caverna is twice as complex straight from round one, but plays the same every time. Those who like to play a game just a few times before trading it/passing on to the newest one will love Caverna for it's "depth and complexity". Those who study late at night for optimal strategies will love Caverna as it gives them a huge spreadsheet to work on. Those who like luck-free games will probably like both, although a small subcategory will prefer Caverna for being even more luck free. Those who like to keep and play a game for life (like me) will dislike Caverna, sooner or later.
7) Caverna has no sense of accomplishment. Since everything is so super easy to achieve you really feel nothing for your efforts. It's like a Feld game actually, all actions will give you VPs one way or another. Four round orange markers in your farm in Agricola means you maxed your vegetables after a long struggle with both the game and the other players. Four beutifully sculpted veggy-pumpkins in Caverna means just 4 points -it's almost sad.

Caverna is not for me. In Agricola I enjoy the interaction, the struggling environment (which creates very tough decisions from realatively simple actions) the replayability and its' excellent sense of accomplishment. Cavarna trades most of these for things I don't care nearly half as much.

Heavy. Literally. The box is enormous. I had this described to me as a sandbox game. I felt like that was true. It allows you to play the game that you want.

Caverna is the next iteration of Agricola.  Much of the game is the same, but it's been largely streamlined and there are some pretty interesting new parts as well.  It does away with the personal hands of cards and replaces them with a communal supply of buildings.  

The rules are fairly simple to pick up for anyone who is familiar with Agricola, but the strategy is going to take me a few plays to get a grasp on.  I look forward to playing more.

RATING: 7
Ah, the [thing=31260][/thing] feels! This will mostly be about comparing [thing=102794][/thing] to [thing=31260][/thing], if that is something you want to know, carry on.

[b]Rules of dungeoneering:[/b]
There are several similarities between the two games, but the most noticeable is the absence of cards for the players to use. They were all replaced for buildings, all available, at first, to everyone. So, the set up is the very same for all. Then, in spite of having several feeding moments, some that could be one after the other (with only one round of preparation of it, like the final round of [thing=31260][/thing]), it is much easier to avoid hunger, as is possible to transform animals, grains, vegetables in food without the requirement of a fireplace or other cooking implements. Furthermore, the game has money, which can also be used to buy food.

There are several intricacies to the game rules, but the basics are: you have a cave space, where the dwarves live, and a forest space, outside the cave. In the cave players can excavate to open tunnels and new areas for new living quarters or buildings, and can mine, to obtain ore and rubies. In the forest is possible to cut the trees down to get spaces to farm and grow crops, or places to surround and turn into pastures for animals. The actions [thing=102794][/thing] are mostly similar to those in [thing=31260][/thing]: get resources (ore, wood, stone, rubies, food, animals), make buildings, fences, plow fields, excavate, making the family bigger, etc.

And also making weapons and go into adventures. Yes, this is the main different part of the actions. Though it is less "adventurous" than it might sound. In game terms it works this way: there are spots in the board in which is possible to forge a weapon by spending ore - the more ore spent, the bigger will be the level of the weapon. With weapons, the dwarves can go into adventures - they are always successful, and there really ins't an adventure phase, in which the dwarves form parties, fight monsters, loot rooms, and these sort of things. What do happens is: there are places that, coupled with a normal actions (like gather wood) the dwarf can also go into an adventure - these go from level 1 to 4. The dwarf gets rewards accordingly to the level of the weapon he has or bellow - so, if a dwarf has a level 7 weapon, he can get rewards from the 7th level or lower. The level of the adventure is equal to how many rewards the dwarf will get: one level 3 adventure gives 3 different rewards. Therefore, using a dwarf with a level 7 weapon, after going to a level 3 adventure, can get one reward level 7, one 5 and one 4, for instance. After getting the rewards, the dwarf rises the level of the weapon in one. Finally, it is worth mentioning that several of the spaces on the main board have two options of actions to use - in most spaces, is possible to do both, and in some, only one or the other. In any case, the duo possibility allows for more to think in the moment of choosing which space to use, and this is a good thing.

Buildings, as one can expect, make certain actions better, allow for others, make for room for more dwarves, to gain points at the end of the game, etc. All the buildings start available for anyone to build them, but most are unique, and once built by someone, you won't be able to get an equal replacement, which makes the fight for them more fierce and the timming to get them all that more relevant.

The goal of the game is to make points, but is different that that of [thing=31260][/thing]. In [thing=31260][/thing] players are required to cover well all areas, first because of the limition in points each of the things have, so, usually, there is no way to make a "grain strategy" or a "cow strategy", as neither of these, alone, will allow to make a whole lot of points, enough to lead to a win; and second, due to the negative points given by lack of things. In [thing=102794][/thing], players can focus their play in certain aspects of the game and do pretty well. Yes, there are still negative points for missing types of animals and unused areas of the player board, but these aren't enough to completely prevent a winning strategy that takes these negative points into consideration. This is because there is no limit of points something can give, so is possible to take one element - rubies, animals, adventures, etc - and boost it to maximum, maybe enough to lead to victory. In [thing=31260][/thing] the winner is usually the best generalist. In [thing=102794][/thing] the winner can be the best specialist.

Oh, and there are shepherd dogs. I love them. I want all of them.

[b]Decisions:[/b]
The set of decisions to be made in game are as complex as those in [thing=31260][/thing], but my take is that, in the first plays, there will be more difficulty to play well, as the spectre of options is broader - there are 48 buildings, while in [thing=31260][/thing] the player has to deal with less than 10 cards and 10 major improvements. Sure, is still possible to play a simpler version in the first games, in order to get used to the ins and outs; to me, though, playing this way, as in the family version of [thing=31260][/thing] (without cards), half of the fun is missing, and this can harm the prospect of follow-up plays. Still, for those familiar with [thing=31260][/thing] I guess it will be easy (as it was for me) to enter stright into the full game of [thing=102794][/thing].

[b]Interaction:[/b]
As in [thing=31260][/thing], in [thing=102794][/thing] the main interaction between players is "someone got what I wanted". And that is it. Is even smaller than you can get in [thing=31260][/thing] when using some of the more interactive decks. [thing=102794][/thing] is definitely one of the type of games in which you do your thing, I do mine, and we meet in the to compare scores. The game requires some attention to what others are up to on their boards, however, it likely won't be something decisive in most plays, and will rarely get into a point that will make someone get their feelings hurt, mad or chased by the others. It is possible that, at a point, losing a key space or building might harm the momentum of a strategy, to the point of making a player lose. But then, this can pass by separated issues (if it something was that important, one should have got it sooner, for instance). Overall, [thing=102794][/thing] can be easily recommended for partners that play often head to head, as the focus stays more in making your own strategy work and use your board better than to throw a wrench in the strategy of others. And, no, this isn't a good title for persons that haven't a good experience in playing board games.

[b]Playing time:[/b]
Perhaps by not having as much pressure to feed the family, [thing=102794][/thing] allowed for a briskier game - in 3 players, we finished the game in around 80 minutes. There were some moments of slowness, pondering about the several options, specially when choosing the reward of adventures - it was common for the game turn pass around and return to the adventuring player and he still didn't choose all the rewards, as everything is good and is of use, and is not always easy to know what is best in that precise moment.

[b]Components:[/b]
The components are of good quality, with the usual great art by Klemens Franz, to the point of having a "night" board, that really doesn't do anything, but is there. Also, the game comes with 2 metric tons (conservative estimation) of wood inside the box, with enough pieces for 7 players. Now, I don't get why someone would want to inflict such a torture on himself and others by playing with 6 or 7. Well, in one hand, it does give more color options to choose from; and, on the other, it makes the price steeper and a pain to carry the game around, as the weight of everything is an absurd.

[b]Final words:[/b]
Overall, [thing=102794][/thing] showed itself as a good game, filled with options for the players, in a level of complexity that will require some plays to be fully understand, and yet, even in the first play, is possible to reach some success in varying degrees. [thing=102794][/thing] does fill the same spot as that of [thing=31260][/thing], with several similarities between them, and even in feel of gameplay - and I can't see why owning both. For me [thing=102794][/thing] isn't superior to [thing=31260][/thing], nor is inferior. [thing=31260][/thing] seems more demanding and cruel - even more when playing with certain decks, or with the great expansion [thing=43018][/thing]. [thing=102794][/thing] is more open, more loose, without so many restraints. However, the potential interrelations of the hundreds of cards of [thing=31260][/thing] allow, if not a really much different end to the farm, at least an almost infinite amount of ways to reach that end. In [thing=102794][/thing], what worked once, can probably work again, as the set of options is always the same at first. It is up for the players to challenge themselves, to seek new paths.

[thing=102794][/thing] is, in the end, a good game, with enough to stand by its own merits.

I definitely like it, adventuring is neat, and I like the tile arrangement idea more than Agricola's farm placement rules.  That said, I miss Agricola's cards.  I feel like right now I'd be equally happy to play either, but long term I'll be tired of this one first.

Caverna has demoted Agricola, but that's no slight to Agricola. Caverna has simply managed to make something that is simultaneously more accessible than Agricola and preserves the depth. Where Agricola achieves depth by punishing poor moves, Caverna asks players to choose wisely from an embarrassment of riches. I no longer find myself solidly in the Agricola Camp or the Caverna Camp. Rather I find that both have their place. But Caverna will find it's place at the table more often, because my game group enjoys its take on complex worker placement just a little more.

Caverna iterates on and, in my opinion, improves on Agricola in a number of ways: enabling players to accomplish many things with one action, providing a robust alternative to farming, and somehow reducing the stress of feeding your family. It eliminates the random improvement and occupation cards, which I always thought were fun, but is probably better for overall balance.  Ultimately, it's not a game I'll ask for every time, or even actively seek out, but I'll happily play it and I'm glad it's in my collection,

Agricola 2?!

Played this prototype in 2011, so it's possible that many things had change since then.

Based on my play at the time, I guess that if you like Agricola you will like this game. If you don't like Agricola, you also probably won't like this.

This game adds dogs, donkeys, metal and a new board with florest on the left side and mountain of on the right side.

This was the first time we all tried the game and took it too long: around 5 hours (with explanation).

I look forward to play this game again but, next time, the English version and with fewer players!

Great game!

Completely corrects everything wrong with Agricola and makes an awesome game!  Why Mayfair is focusing on promoting Agricola over this game is mind blowing.

One of my favorite worker placement games.  It is a long, but very enjoyable game, and you are always paying attention to what other players are choosing on the board, while planning your own path to victory!  The amount of wooden pieces is staggering and adds to the theme of the game.  Replay value is very high, as you have various rooms to build and different strategies for every game.  Is a great stand-alone game, but would welcome an expansion if produced.

Great game with lots to explore.  I like this one solo.  The bits make the experience.  The argument of whether or not to own this or Agricola is foolish, both are different and great in their own way.  It's fun to build your cave and your farm.  Lots of things to try.  

so purely a euro. got tired and sold it.  Agricola survived.

RATING: 8
I love Agricola, and I love Caverna. No coincidence, as the games really feel similar during play. That being said, I personally like Caverna a little better because of (a) the theme (fantasy, Dwarves), (b) its tempo (most actions are really 2-in-1 in Agricola terms), (c) the building tiles that replace the cards, (d) the streamlined scoring (very clear and simple) and (e) the more forgiving feeding phase (making it easier to actually get things done and make progress). Because of the overal stress reduction, my girlfriend likes it a LOT better. So I sold Agricola :-).

Hard to rate as I see it so close to Agricola. I like some of the changes, but for example the Adventuring felt quite disconnected from the rest of the game. Crazy setup time and fixed buildings don't get me too excited. But of course it is a solid game that I'm happy to play again.

After falling in love with Agricola on iOS with no physical copy, I jumped on this as soon as I could. I was lucky to grab a copy from the inital limited US release. And fortunately, it was good!

Despite the similar mechanisms, there is a different enough feel in the play of Agricola and Caverna (random setup / hard vs open setup / rewarding) that I find both pleasant. I actually bought a physical copy of Agricola anyway, since Caverna buyers were off loading them!

Good game, but I will always prefer Agricola. I miss the unique advantages that the cards in Agricola offer, and I also miss building an engine for food (oven/cooking pit) that I enjoyed in Agricola. Furthermore I think the dwarf theme is a bit weird, and the addition of rubies/ore/weapons makes the game even more fiddly than Agricola. Other than that the game is solid, and there is definitely fun in finding new strategies using the free-for-all buildings.

At first, this game seemed like it was Agricola 2.0 as many claim it to be. You will enjoy it and have plenty of fun for a series of plays. However, overtime you will get bored of it and it will get extremely repetitive. It will get to the point where you simply just don't want to play anymore, or at least that's how I feel. I was planning on buying the game but my cousins beat me to it. At first I felt pretty bad because my Agricola game seemed impervious to this updated game, but not anymore.

First off, there is very little variance in the game. It's the same rooms every time and therefore you'll be going for the same strategy, every time. Sure, your strategy may change as plays are made and people end up taking your rooms and resources, but you still move onto other strategies which are also the same thing every game. The game is also way too easy, after all the games I've played, no one has gotten the beggar token. It's like there is no reason for it. Moves just aren't as meaningful as they are in Agricola, you're just never on the edge and while Agricola could of been a little more forgiving, this game is just intensely forgiving.

As for the expedition concept, it sounded great and was fun for a few, but eventually it became annoying and it's too powerful to avoid. This idea adds unnecessary length to the game as do all these additional actions we get when we compare this game to Agricola. The length of this game is just way too long, the more people, the worse it becomes. It's just so hard focusing in this game, makes me wanna do something else as I wait for everyone to take their turn. As for our player boards, I'm not sure why the developer would not allow them to nicely store resources on and to have them not be generic. Everyone has the same board for crying out loud, why?

In the end, this game is pretty bad and I no longer think it's better than Agricola. It was a direction that the developer shouldn't of went in with these farming board games, it just didn't work. I'm really not surprised why no expansions are being developed for it. The board also wasn't very colorful or appealing to look at, while that has no real importance, it's something to mention when the gameplay doesn't make up for it. Now instead of adding this game to my collection, I rather just purchase some expansions for Agricola.

As for right now there is only one way this game can be fixed and that's to add a major expansion which would add many more new rooms to the game where we can put in a bag, mix up for each game, and draw them out on the table so things are different each time, giving us different strategies to work with, which would greatly increase replayability in the game.

I hesitated to dub this straight-up better than Agricola, but I think that's just the case.  I've been having a hard time finding anything I really like better about Agricola and they're very similar overall.

Seems like a really good, solid game here.  The one thing that I'm kind of afraid of is the buildings and a) how things change with 3 players instead of 4, and b) how much the competition for them is reduced when there's suddenly 80% extra buildings available.  The competition level for the buildings felt about right with 4-players and only the base buildings available, but we'll see how I feel about that after more plays.

Still have only played with introductory buildings so far.  It definitely felt much looser than Agricola, you don't feel like you're constantly blocked and unable to do things, yet still stressed for getting the actions you need. I like all of the options and multiple things to focus on.  Scoring is much more streamlined also. There is still that pressure to feed, maybe not quite as tense. Looking forward to more plays man is it a beast to setup and teardown.

Nice game that feels like Agricola and glass road mashed together. Comparisons to Agricola heavily used because game claims to be an improvement of it and is regarded as the next messiah. However, it does not drop Agricola from its throne. Here there is no urgency to feed your family so it feels like a point optimization instead of a survival battle. To each his own but I think it is a huge leap in a worse direction and has removed the best thing about Agricola and just stuck with the main-stream stuff that is found in every other generic worker placement point optimization game. This will appeal to the mamas-boys who feel that Agricola is an evil game and don't like it when the game itself is a challenge, reducing it to pure points collecting. I have also started losing faith in the boardgaming community seeing this be praised as an improvement over Agricola, it saddens me that we seem to want our food ready chewed.
Note that this does not mean that Caverna is bad, it's just mediocre and never my first choice.

I wished I could give this a zero.

Prime example of Tom Vasel over hyping a game, the parts, the box, gets him going, then throw in another Rosenberg rehash we have seen time and time again from him, that Vasel can not get enough and you get a very skeptical review wrapped around high praise. I understand this is a personal perspective, preference, but Vasel has issues to themes he has gotten tired of, therefore in his world "we" should too", but he never seems to grow tired of this resource trade in game with just another theme slap on. As long as it is stepped, get a, get b, trade a and B, it is another slam dunk as it is themed and make sense? 

Be warned, the high rating of this game maybe caused by the Rosenberg Fan Club, those that will shell out a $100, don't care about Mayfair's forced getting near MSRP. Those that want it, in the Rosenberg fan club and willingness to pay that artificial high price are very unlikely to rate it low. They go into loving it. Anybody stating there is tension in this game must be playing some other game. It is totally lacking in that regard.

Learn a valuable lesson about watching Dice Towers. Well, I have stopped watching it, defaulting to others.  I can not take the dice love, the Rosenberg worship, the whining I have played thousands of games and I am sick of, Egyptian themes, Mediterranean themes, etc. Well, I haven't.

(after 2 games, 1 4p and 1 5p)  It is similar to Agricola, but does add some twists.  No negative points for not having "stuff" (animals/grain/vegie) collected.   The chance to add weapons to your family member and send them adventuring to gather "loot".  Lots more ways to pimp out your "house/cave" with specialty rooms which replace the cards.

There is a lot of goodness in here.  Glad 2 guys in my game group own it.  Will likely be hitting the table for weeks to come.

Agricola 2.0 - with more bits and less tension.

I prefer Uwe's games of old that make you sweat, but sometimes less stress is a nice departure. Caverna is probably an easier game than Agricola to introduce to newer players, since there is no hidden information (cards). Still, I think the cards are what makes Agricola what it is, and I ultimately prefer it over this one.

Not sure if I enjoy Caverna more than Agricola.  So tough to choose!  I love how open Caverna is (vs. the always starving-to-death restrictedness of Agricola).  Always having really great options is definitely a plus: you can take numerous different routes to developing your settlement and earning points.  Clearing your board and cave gives you a real sense of accomplishment.  Adventuring/leveling up your dwarves is also a fantastic addition to this type of game.  Where Caverna suffers in comparison to Agricola is: not all of the heaps and heaps of rooms available are as interesting and/or useful as others.  Some of those rooms have never seen play in my games.  Having a bunch of rooms available pales in comparison to Agricola's occupation/minor improvement decks.  Those are way better.  Either way, I'm always happy to play this or Agricola.  They're different flavors of an otherwise delicious treat!    
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Excellent "building" game. Lived up to Agricola 2.0 moniker.
Pros: Tile laying to build your cave and farm is fun! Lots of valuable spots and upgrades, feeding doesn't feel like a horrible chore but finding a food solution is more fun. Many options for converting resources to food if needed. No more fiddly wood stick fences! Plays 2 players - 5 players well, but supports 6 and 7 if needed. 

Cons: Biggest complaint is there are extra components for a 7th player but I feel like I'll never actually go that high! Game is expensive, never would have bought it w/o Amazon credit. SOOOO many pieces between resource token and tons of tiles, I had to build my own insert. Relying on bags alone is terrible. I hate sorting through ~40 tokens to find the weapon level you need 5-10 times a game.

Overall, the game is great, but pretty expensive and yet STILL requires a few upgrades (Which takes time or money or both) to negate a few component downsides.

RATING: N/A
I like that the scoring is a lot more straight-forward than Agricola (more 1 unit: 1 point). The expeditions add a really interesting dimension, and I like the decision to have certain resources only obtainable through those expeditions. Harvests come hard and fast and I think they help keep the game pretty even.

RATING: 8.5
UPDATE: Based on two plays, this is the game I wished Agricola had been. Lots of strategic options without the misery of having to feed before you can do anything interesting. Gorgeous graphics, quirky theme and... Dogs. Love the dogs. Teardown has speeded up from our first play.

Based on one play, this is Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small the all-you-can-eat buffet edition. Much less pressure to feed, billions of options, over-the-top component quality. 

The teardown, setup and offer refresh does not scale with the number of players, making it a nightmare akin to a Fantasy Flight Ameritrash monstrosity. Husband was in charge of offer refresh and, while he was processing the rounds, I got changed... Made myself a cup of coffee... Etc. It took a VERY long time. We are thinking how to speed up the setup time.

Maddening in a different way than Agricola. Here you're  paralyzed by too many choices and actions vs competition for scarce resources/actions. The game feels very Agricolaesque this way and there are many similarities. A bit long for 4 players but probably as long as Agricola with 4. Enjoyed it more with 4 than with 3. Also eliminates the "unfairness" of occupations and minor improvements for people who complain about that in Agricola. Overall, a more "easygoing" and less tight game in terms of less direct competition with opponents for actions and resources (that changes at higher player counts) and less pressure to feed your people. More of a sandbox game as there are several strategies you can adopt to win. 

After playing with 2, Caverna is a better, meatier game than Agricola for that number. There is more you can do and more paths to victory. The game also lasts a bit longer.

After a couple of play throughs, not near as complicated as it looked (lots of bits and bobs and was a bit intimidating when we first broke open the box). My 11 year old took to it quickly, and by game 3 we were onto the advanced version (more building options). Personally, prefer this to Agricola, still a fair bit of strategy on combining synergy with your furnishings, but they're all laid out to see and mull as the game progresses. One also gets to actually see their engine rev a bit before the game wraps up (this was always a frustrating element of Ag for me that left me feeling like the game needed a few more rounds in it, JUST when you began to really get your farm humming along...game over, Caverna consistently lets me enjoy the fruits of my choices and labor - generally for at least 1-2 rounds). It is a big game that takes a bit to set up and tear down, and will eat table space. Once you've played a few times you can easily play out in 30 min / per player.

RATING: 9
This is a wonderfull game! I liked Agricola but this is even better. It feels like you have more control over the game and the designers made sure that randomness is reduced to a minimum. The 'forging a weapon' twist is also a powerfull contribution to the overall gameplay. You still have a zillion options, preparing the game takes time and the prize is pretty heavy, but this will definitly see a lot more play in the months and years to come.

RATING: 7.2
The new heavyweight on the block.  My rating has dropped with more play.  Too long, even with 3 players and the basic rooms.  More of everything does not necessarily make things better.  Good but not great.  Given the choice of Caverna or Agricola, I'll choose the latter.

Caverna feels like a less "tight" version of Agricola (due to the massive number of double action spaces and the ease of getting food). It's a good game with many viable paths to victory and interesting decisions, but it really suffers from static setup. I miss the huge variety of cards from Agricola - the puzzle of making strategy on the basis of unique combination of cards made each game unique and special. 

The "sandbox" nature of Caverna may appeal to many players, but for me it just kills most of the tension and the sense of real struggle that were crucial to the fantastic gaming experience in Agricola. That sense of freedom is just an illusion anyway - you still get punished for all the things you didn't do so you'll have to do a bit of everything. Still,  I would pick Caverna over Fields of Arle any day - that game is way too open-ended for my taste.

And just a word of warning - the number of information on the board to process before the first game is rather daunting. This feeling goes away after you understand what you do, but still there's a lot to take in.

Looks great, weighs a ton and an excellent game. So many choices. Could be overwhelming if you let it. The weaponed up dwarf and the order of play in terms of having to play the weakest first and hope the space is still available when you want to play your big guy. Butterflies in the tummy time. An excellent game. I can see this going to the number one spot.

RATING: 7.5
Very good, but I'm not sure that I like it better than Agricola.  But, it deserves more plays.  My first play was weak - probably from not really understanding the building options.

After a second play, I'm pretty sure I like Agricola better.  It has more options and variety of strategies.

I have no idea how people can say this is a better game than agricola and better to intro to newbie players.

Pinnacle of euro gaming bliss. I've recently lost my desire to play most euro games, but this one is still an amazing experience. the game is a sandbox with multiple ways to play. It's deep. It's a very physical experience with dozens (hundreds?) of meeples shaped like what they are (no yellow= food, etc.). It scales perfectly for 1-7. It's beautiful. It's got a wonderful theme. It's the only euro in my top 10.

Agricola 2.0 is a great way to describe the game.

For me this is NOT the 3rd best game of all but I must say i really enjoyed my first game. The rules are long and there is too much going on, too many bit here and there...but... during the game, immediately after the first turn i would say, everything becomes quite clear, and the flow of the game keeps fast and engaging. Of course one of the best thing is the feeling of growth and improvement. There's a lot of fiddly work to do during all the game and i don't like this very much, i would probably prefer this in a PC, but still , I consider Caverna a very nice, if lengthy, experience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I enjoy Agricola quite a bit, but I always considered adding an additional round before harvest to give myself and the other players a bit more time to do more, just a little less struggling and a bit more building. So if I had one complaint about Agricola it's that pressure that I'd rather not deal with.

Caverna fixes that problem and removes some interesting parts of Agricola while adding some new mechanics that aren't any more or less interesting than Agricola, just different. 

- We lose the card play that Agricola is lauded for: no occupations or minor improvements. I'm okay with this and I think it actually helps with new players.
- We gain a building mechanism that simplifies building fences, rooms, and fields, in addition to gaining other rooms that give you the same perks and benefits that major and minor occupations once did. 
- We have more resources and less to worry about come harvest time, but we know less about when harvest time is.

Overall, I prefer this to Agricola, but it's not a replacement. I worry about Caverna's long-term prospects and whether or not you'd get as much play out of it compared to Agricola. However, for now it's a fantastic game and one worth paying the premium price for.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Caverns is a fun spin on a worker placement game. There are a lot of ways to win, and my strategy continues to evolve across each round depending on my opponents play. My biggest complaint about this game is that the length of the game increases with the number of players, and even at the end of a long game it can leave you feeling like there is still more to do.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
A game of wide choices, yet not overwhelming types of decision making.  I agree with other comments that each player should fashion weapons and go exploring.  If not, the one player that explores will had a significant advantage.  It is quite gratifying to look at one's farm and cavern by the end of the game and see the development in all of the varied areas.  Takes a bit of time for the set up and tear down, but well worth it!  It doesn't replace Agricola, and it stands alone as it's "own" game.

After playing my friend's copy of Agricola (which I originally avoided due to its 18th century farming theme), I ran out and picked up a copy of Caverna (as to avoid overlap with my friend's collection of games).  And while I am in the minority, I like it better, and here's why: Caverna has no luck to it.  There's no chance that one player get a killer hand of Minor Improvements and Occupations while another gets crap.  All of the Furnishings (this game's equivalent) are available to all players at the start of the game and are first come first serve.  You have to prepare a good strategy and a viable backup strategy in case someone grabs the Furnishing you were hoping for.  And if you want it to be like Agricola, fine, then ignore the rulebook and hand out Funishings to each player at random at the start of the game.  It's much easier to add a luck aspect to this game than it is to remove it from Agricola (unless you want to play Family Version every time).  There's also just more you can do in this game than Agricola, and the parts that needed to be simplified have been.  Fantastic game, should be in everyone's collection.

My ONLY complaint about this game is that it's just as deep, if not deeper than Agricola and so turns can take a really long time if players really consider all of their options.  In games of 3 or more, expect to see players get distracted by their smartphones.

Overall, I really dig this game. It smooths out some of the clunkiness of Agricola. A whole ton of upgrade tiles available at the start is almost overwhelming for the possibilities.  But I don't mind that. Going out for adventure is the part that doesn't fit for me and it seems that to win you must take this path. Since I'm already invested in Agricola I will have to let this one go, fun though it is.

RATING: 8.84
Caverna gives you lots of options so that you don't have to play the same way each time; you can focus on growing grain and pumpkins or entirely on different kinds of livestock, you can be a miner and produce lots of ore to sell at the market, or maybe craft that ore into weapons and go adventuring.  It's a big game, it will take at least a half hour per player, and it's best played with people who have already played for it... but it's also something of an experience.  If you like worker placement with a bit of narrative and story, play this.

I really like the combination of worker placement and developing your own land and cave. There are so many options; it kind of feels like a point salad Feld (not a bad thing in my eye). I feel it will take a number of plays to determine it's true score for me and all the options are difficult to get your head round on a first play but I am excited about playing again to explore all this. Due to only having played once my rating may change a little.

RATING: 9
The (main) reason I rated Caverna that high is the fact that I love(!) boardgames designed by Uwe Rosenberg - I love the theme and I love the mechanics (and I love the fact that there are cute little donkeys involved in the whole thing). Another thing I really like is the artwork made by Klemens Franz - especially all the little details appearing only on some of the tiles. Allthough it appears to be a heavy, complex game, the whole theme makes it really easy to understand what e.g. to do to get food for the dwarfs, what the dwarfs need weapons for and why you have to dig through the mountains or cut down the forest. I think the story itself makes the game so wonderful and allthough it sometimes takes 3 hours to finish a game, I have used it as a gateway game for friends of mine who rarely play (and sometimes never even played "middle/heavy weight") board games and the fact that they loved it almost as much as I do, is proof that it doesn't take games like Ticket to Ride (which I have used as a gateway game before - but unfortunately some people got stuck on it) to get people to play "great" board games. Thank you, Uwe!

I've only played this once or twice (an acquaintance owns it). However, the depth of options and hefty amount of possibilities is INSANE. I feel like Uwe made a list of spaces he wanted in the game and when it came time to edit them, he just went "Nah, we'll use 'em all" but it really does work. I don't know if I'll ever own it honesty. The high price and the fact that it would probably get played once or twice a year (the length- uhg :shake:) keeps me from that, but maybe someday. If you want a definitive euro, this is it.

The game has some nice changes from it's predecessor Agricola. I do like the many different ways to score points. However, I do miss the card play that was in Agricola and feel like this is a little bit to open of a game for my tastes.  I like the game enough to keep it in my collection but I don't considered a must-have. As of now, I do prefer Agricola to this game due to the tough decisions it puts in front of you in the unique card combos. Caverna is pretty much the same every game with the same buildings being available every game.  There are some slight variations between games but not much.

A nice variation on Agricola.  There are quite a few simplifications and improvements.  I still like the minor improvements and occupations cards, but this will appeal to a slightly different audience.  It still has quite a large front-loaded learning curve, since there are immediately 20 or so actions available, and 40 or so buildings -- each with a different power.  The box and contents are truly a measure of excess, but ultimately success as well.  I look forward to another play or three.

5 after 1 play

Artwork and game components quality are very good. The game mechanic is however let down by the "looseness" of the action spaces. This reduces player interaction as viable alternatives are almost certainly available and also increases the multiple player solitaire feel. On top of that, the tableau of 48 different tiles to consider throughout the game increases downtime drastically. Lastly, the strength of the expeditions makes taking other actions decidedly weaker and the rewards of the expeditions are not thematic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.8
I liked Agricola and Caverna keeps all the enjoyable elements of that game and removes the irritating ones. The theme has wider appeal and the components are really nice. I haven't played enough to really get a feel for competitive strategies in this game, I just like doing my thing and seeing how it turns out. The area I feel like Agricola does better is in the card play which leads to greater variability. Playing at different player counts is the only way to change the opening situation which isn't ideal.

Love this. It's a heavy game, but approachable enough that I am able to play with my 9 and 11 year old daughters. 

Every time you have to make a decision there are difference factors to consider, the board is constantly changing and there are many paths to points. I love the amount of choices you have and the interestingness of the decisions you have to make (you can never do everything).

Also, the pieces are adorable and breeding animals, growing pumpkins, etc. and watching your farm/family/home grow is really satisfying.

The only downside is that it can take a long time to play, especially since some players can experience AP and take too long on their turns. I recommend having some sort of time limit just to keep things moving.

But aside from that it's a great game, I find it engaging all the way through and it's great with my kids.

I only played this one solo so far. But this is a splendid game. My score is certainly gonna be higher when I also will have played this with more players.

One of my favorite games. Very wide open, which some people hate, but I really enjoy it. I find it to be a pretty relaxing game. Some people think that it shouldn't be played with more than 4 but I like it with all player counts...even if it did take 4 hours to play that 7 player game

I tought was not possible to have more material in a game as sg4ivola hav3. Caverna is huge but playable and for my opinion a better improvement of agricola and ora at labora too.

A big, meaty Euro. Tons of options and I usually want to immediately play again, even after 3 hours.

Another slam dunk.  I wondered if [person=10]Uwe[/person] could hit me with another [b][bgcolor=#00cc00] 10 [/bgcolor][/b].  He's done it.  If you know [thing=31260][/thing], you're just 5 minutes from knowing the rules, but although it's the same type of experience, it is [b]not[/b] the same game.  So… excellent!

Recieved it today, but it was missing two game boards.  Soooo, haven't played it yet.  
Mayfair made it right.  Played it.  It is awesome.

Caverna is one of the most balanced, varied, and fun board games I've ever played. 

The farming, mining, expeditions, ruby collecting, and high amount of variance in food collection and animal husbandry all make this game feel incredibly diverse and highly re-playable.

Kellemes csalódás nekem ez a játék, ugyanis az Agricola nem igazán jött be. Méltán lehet nevezni Agricola 2.0-nak, ugyanis minden ki lett belőle lúgozva ami az elődjénél el lett rontva. Nem hiába foglalja el a 4. helyet a stratégiai játékoknál!!!

Less stressful than Agricola. A lot more to options also for building and expanding.

Caverna is great.  At the higher player counts it can drag just a bit, but I don't mind a long game.  It can lead to some AP for some players, and they may need to be encouraged to keep moving.

I really wanted to like this game more than I do. It is still a good strategic Euro game to play, but I would not qualify it as necessarily fun. Sometimes, the feeding mechanism can be downright stressful. I will admit though that the more I play it the more I like it.

To me, this game is Agricola perfected.  It removes the more punishing aspects of food generation, the punishing aspects of random card dealing and the stress involved with playing Agricola and replaces them with fun, fun, fun.

In Agricola, I always felt I was playing against the game first and the other players second, with Caverna, I feel like I am in a race against other players to accomplish what I think will win me the game.  While Agricola punishes you hard for failure to pay attention to food, Caverna just sets you back a bit.  A minor penalty vs. a game misconduct (to use hockey terms).

The components are fantastic, much better than most other games, and the theme of farming and developing your cave feels integrated and immersive.

While I still believe that Agricola has a place in the gaming world as a truly difficult game and does not need to be removed from print, for most people, Caverna is going to give you more bang for your buck and be a much more enjoyable game.

I love worker placement and engine building, and even though the theme on this is kind of 'bleh' (farming, come on Uwe, use a different theme!), I can forgive it, as the theme does shine in this game, more so than in Agricola, and other games by Uwe Rosenberg, where the theme seems to melt away behind the mechanics. At the end of the game, even if you didn't win, at least you can look at the cool farm/cave system you built.

This rating is for 3+ player games, as I find Caverna intolerable below 3. That being said - wow. What a wonderfully crafted experience. I'm not sure I could pick between this or Terra Mystica for best Euro as they both prioritize totally different gameplay mechanisms.

Edit: 9/28/15
Wow, I got bored with this one really quickly. The lacking variability really becomes evident after a few plays. This is only augmented by my having a single game group with players utilizing consistent strategies. I won't dock the rating too much as it was great fun while it lasted, but for all intents and purposes Agricola has taken the throne for Euro WP.

RATING: 6.8
Very beautiful, and a satisfyingly clever attempt to translate reincarnation and karma into a game - and this is where the theme breaks down: rising the karmic ladder competitively? Nononono. :-) 
Still: fun, and brutal. Do try it.

1st play: The theme is really cool, and the basic idea is interesting.  I like the thing that playing a card for it's ability means that you may have it come back to hit you in a future turn.  The art is also excellent.  Somehow though, the game doesn't really work as well as I'd have hoped.  It feels very race-oriented and not easy to slow down or prevent the other player from ascending each time.

2nd play: Each play has resulted in an improved feeling about this game.  The Karma effects between lives is executed well and trying to race while just hindering your opponent enough to shut them down is a tight balancing act.  The effects of the big cards are strong but their point values are also very tempting.  Tempo is very important in this one, and I am curious to see how it works with more than 2.

:thumbsup: [b]POSITIVE POINTS:[/b]

++ Nice "future life" (next) hand-building and hand-management card game, where you race over several lives in order to ascent the karmic ladder, from dung beetles up to Transcendence (victory).
++ I really like the karma mechanism, where you have to offer to your opponents cards that were played against them (Great integration of game-play mechanisms to the karma theme).
++ Since the game is mainly a race to victory, my wife and I don't really care that a lot of the cards are direct player interaction type ("take-that"), even though it's not a thing we particularly like usually (I think that the karma mechanism also play a role to accepting the take-that element).
++ Gorgeous paint-like artwork.
++ Good card graphic design, that is clean and clear.
++ Good game insert which hold everything in an orderly fashion (and that allows for sleeved cards).
++ It's a fun, fast to set-up and fast to play card game.


:thumbsdown: [b]NEGATIVE POINTS:[/b]

-- The game was kind of expansive for what it is (for the Kickstarter edition, that didn't offer anything exclusive), but I was still glad to support some fellow Canadians designers with this Kickstarter (as this KS was a true campaign to make a project comes to life).
-- The cards seem to damage easily as just by sleeving them, I have damage some of them in the corner even though I'm really careful when sleeving.
-- There is a bit more randomness than I like when you play your current life if you didn't properly stash cards for your future life (carefully planning your next hand is crucial to victory).
-- The replayability, especially when played over and over with the same opponent (like I do as I mainly play 2-player games with my wife), is a bit lower since this game has only 64 cards, so most of the replayability come from the cards draw order, and the strategy/combos used by your opponent(s).
-- Maybe a bit light for us, but it's still a fun game to play on weekday evenings when we don't want to start something heavier).
-- For an unknown reason to date, I'm not really good at this game as my wife beat me more than 80% of the time.

Interesting little card game.  This one will take a couple go arounds before it becomes a lot of fun.  Not overly complex but can be a little tricky to bring new and novice players up to speed sometimes.  Once you get a few play throughs under your belt it can be a pretty fun.

First game is positive. There is tactic in the current life, and a strategy in play for your future life. In 4 player game, the end game is slightly chaotic as there are many screwage going around, and the number 2 player ended up winning (Me). Remind me of the end game of munchkin which i dislike.

PNP version. At first it seemed that the most important thing is thinning your deck, since if you have a lucky hand, it is imperative that you die as fast as possible to ascend. However, there are some pretty clever ways to make sure that happens that aren't just up to luck, and the karmic balance that the game enforces is an excellent concept.

Ok game with some theming that goes against the strategy which makes the game confusing to play your first time.  Most of the "bad" cards to use on rivals actually speed up opponent's lives which is what they WANT to do.  Counter-intuitive strategy, while it makes the game interesting to learn and figure out, is a big downside in my opinion.  It honestly feels like the makers of the game did not even realize what the best strategy was for their own game when they designed it.

A neat concept that works well with deckbuilding. Reincarnation conceptually abstracted and combined with a card game style hand management and card effects that aren't too complex. Strategy is simple and could get munchkiny at the end. The take that just lengthens the game to no benefit. Good art.

As mentioned by most others, the game's art is gorgeous. The mechanics are all very thematic, and are translated into gameplay pretty well. There are multiple strategies: living quickly as possible, setting up a perfect "value" future life; playing offensively, and ruining other players' points at opportune times, and even focusing on card draw can work (though it is, of course, less consistent). 

The game is not too complex, but it feels good to play. Turns go by quickly, unless one person in the group likes to scheme. There is ample opportunity to plan ahead, and it is rewarding, but not necessary. 

Overall, the game is fun, tight, and absolutely beautiful.

(From print and play)
Decisions in planning out your next life are neat: trying to maximize output of a particular color. 2-player play is highly reactive to the other player's play patterns. So few cards are drawn though that the two or three 3-value cards are such a big deal, either in ascendancy or their powerful action effects, that they really throw the game into a pretty random territory.

Has some take-that, but it doesn't feel TOO nasty because there is this feeling of what comes around, goes around.

Each "hand" of cards is 6: some that start in your hand and the difference being your deck of unknown cards. Each turn you will draw a card from your deck (if any) and play one card.

When you play a card, you may use the card for one thing:
POINTS: You must have a minimum value (shown on score track) in one color to advance up the ladder.
SAVE FOR FUTURE LIFE: Set the card aside for your "future life."
ABILITY: Do the text effect on the card. If it was an attack card, the person you attacked may take the card into their future life stack. If the card affected you, it is offered to the player to your left.

After you have run out of cards in your deck and hand, you will see if you advance one step up the scoring track/ladder. If you don't advance, you get a ring (adds 1 to value of future attempt to go up ladder).

Either way, you take the cards in your "future life" stack into your hand. Then you draw the difference [6-# of cards currently in your hand] as your new face-down deck from the deck/well in the middle of the table.

Solid engine-builder-ish thing. The core game is surprisingly deep. It doesn't look like it to start with, but the last couple of lives can have interesting decisions regarding ruining opponents' cards, building your own future life, or setting yourself up for ascension. 

Also, looks gorgeous and the box insert is really, REALLY well designed. Which I probably appreciate more than most people, but still.

RATING: 6.5
This game had a lot of cool ideas. I really liked the way the different colored cards each had a sort of theme to them, and I loved how you could build your next life's hand while playing the current life. And that's important because it's a race game so getting through a life and onto the next one quickly is an important part. There are a lot of tempo decisions and surprisingly sometimes giving people cards is a fairly aggressive move. I also think the card effects are interesting and I like that there is some cool potential for comboing effects together. But you might now have noticed two things, that this is a race game and there are attack cards, that might set off some red flags. This combination of traits is the reason the game is rated a bit lower for me, because together they can cause the endgame to really drag where anytime anyone gets close to winning they get knocked back down by everyone else. This really destroys the tempo of the game. It's similar to the main problem munchkin has, though there's an otherwise good game attached to it here.

I thought this was a fun game until the last round.  It seemed very easy for the other players to gang up on the leader to extend the game, but they were never able to get any closer to winning themselves.  So we got stuck in this stalemate in the last round.

The artwork is absolutely beautiful though.

Karmaka has some interesting concepts.  For instance, when you play a card you have to give your opponent the chance to take it and use it next round. The planning from round to round is also interesting since when playing each card you can play it for points or put it into your hand for next round. Quick-playing game and quick setup - it doesn't overstay its welcome and it presents interesting decisions.

The art is awesomely beautiful and the mechanism of giving cards you have used for abilities to other players is nice. It suits the theme that anything bad you have done may come to haunt you in a future life. However, the gameplay consists of two phases of relative straightforwardnesses. There is some comboing options within the cards, but the card pool is very narrow. Therefore you have seen everything at the end of first phase which takes place when players start to reach the ape level. The second phase is then just constant take that dullness of trying to stop other players from winning while squeezing to the victory yourself. There can be occasional fun moments in the endgame, but it is still overall dull and highly unthematic stepping on others to reach nirvana.

A good game. But nothing special.

What's good about it:
* The artwork.
* Fun theme and well implemented mechanically. Managing the three persoanl card 'pools' (deck, hand and Future Life) makes for some very interesting playstyle options.
* Skillfull gameplay.

The bad:
* Very small cardpool. You'll have experienced all the cards in your first game.
* Unbalanced gameplay. Perhaps this is better in a 3 or 4 player game but yeah... some cards are just useless while others are always usefull.
* Luck factor. Enough so that 'racing to Transcendence' is a valid, and perhaps even optimal/near optimal strategy.
* Who is this game for? I first asked a less experienced/casual gamer to play and he was scared off by the terminology and the skillceiling. But for experienced gamers the card pool is too small, there isn't enough really meaty play, the optimal play is damned obvious, etc.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

There is quite a bit of nastiness and take that in this game but the beautiful thing is that you can then take that card and return the favor in a future life (future hand). You are racing up the track trying to be the first to move up the ladder four times. Artwork is really beautiful. Theme is about reincarnation and karma which works in this game. On your turn you are usually either playing a card for its action and discarding it (or, more likely giving it to your opponent to use against you in the future), putting it on your display to try and reach the required number to move up the ladder later, or placing it face down in your future hand you are creating. Sometimes, you focus on creating your  future hand knowing you aren't going to be successful at reincarnating and moving up the track - if you fail to move up the track you gain a ring to give you a +1 on your next attempt and rings can stack.

Lovely art on the cards and the main board. Worked fine at 2-player. Plays up to 4 people. Thoughtfully designed for travel, with 2 cards added that represent the main board if you want to leave the box and board at home, and just take the cards with you. The game has multi-use cards, which I like. You either play cards with certain numbered values down, so you can ascend up the karmic ladder, or you play a card for the power. It's nice that if a card is played for the power, then the other person has the option to take that card and place it in their "next life" deck for future use.

A Kickstarter game that Ron found a thrifted, unopened copy of. That's weird in and of itself. But it looked neat.

It's got some really interesting ideas happening. The "karma and rebirth" element is very strong and well-realized. It seems like it was designed for two players but worked fine with three. And the artwork was very nice. I very decent KS production.

[PnP] Played one match.  Quite different than what I had expected.  Lots of "take that" and disruptive play, especially in the end when the goal is to stop others from ascending first.  Instead of good karma and helping each other ascend it is a race to the top.  The theme does not translate into gameplay, quite the opposite.  Apart from that, it has some good mechanics and is interesting, will probably give it a few more chances before passing final judgment.

A game in which it's mechanic is completely married to it's theme. I highly recommend this game. and it's PnP!

The card's art is beautiful.

Even thou you must draw cards (Luck involved) the way you play those cards it's of most importance. The way you secure your ascension, prepare your future life or hinder you foe are even more important than a good draw.

The Karmic Cost, which would be the core mechanic of the game, will make you think twice before playing a card to jeopardize your opponent's ascension.

A great game.

This game excels as a "small" game.  By small I mean it works equally great if it's 2 players, 3 or 4.  It also doens't take up much table space, so this is a game that my girlfriend and I often take to our favorite growler bar.

The Karma aspect of the game is unique and fun.  Basically if you play a card for it's ability, your opponents choose if they'd like the card for their next life, so it may very well come back to you.

The game strikes an excellent balance between being pretty easy to learn and yet having a lot of depth to the strategy.  Games are generally 15-30 minutes for experienced players.  The first 2 or 3 times might take you 25-45, possibly longer if it's a 4 player game.

Are there better games out there, yes, but for what this game is, a 2-4 player, short duration, small foot print game, that's simple to learn, but deep in strategy, this game just really excels at what it does.

The artwork is gorgeous and the design is well-executed in the theme.  Having the cards come back to haunt you in a future life can create some laugh out loud moments.

I think it can overstay its welcome as the time it takes for the player to ascend from the final life can take as long as the rest of the game.  It's hard to know how this can be improved.  The game is essentially a race.  When it's close, it feels like it was probably determined by who the start player was.  When it's not close, it feels like it should have finished a while ago.

Played one 4-player game with the print and play. Not sold on the theme in multiplayer at least, and the gameplay, although interesting at first, soon felt like it lacked depth. It's partially that I'm more used to deckbuilders which tend to emphasize more on deck construction.

Probably a two player game will be more strategic, since power cards used for their abilities will be directly traded. 

Although I would be willing to pay 25$ for this game given the quality of the art, nearly $50 is too much for me. I'm annoyed that despite being produced by a Canadian company, the costs are in USD and shipping to Canada is significantly more expensive.

It's a fine game, with decent interaction. The art is some of the best I've ever seen on a game. Got it from Kickstarter and thought it was fine, but another player really really loved it so I sold it to him. I probably would have kept it for the beautiful art alone but it'll see much more table time where it went. 

It's actually better than I expected it to be. It has a munchkin-esque end where people are frantically trying to stop the leader from winning which usually makes me hate a game, but there are lots of neat decisions to make through the rest of the game.

Love the choices in this game and the flow. I like tactical card games with meaningful player interaction - deeper than "take that". Having to offer your opponent the ability you just used against them gives you pause. Timing when to play deeds (points) in this life or set aside for the next life (round), the flow of how you get and use cards, the awesome card abilities, the amazing art, and more - all this will keep the game in active circulation in my game collection. Happy backer. :)

I have the PnP version.

It's a nice little game. I really have nothing bad to say other that some people can be a little turned off by the luck of the draw.
I don't say that this game is total luck just the usual draw luck that any other game has.

It is a race game after all in it's heart and the one to find the first 3 value cards has a higher chance to win than the other player (it's not the rule but it happens).

Overall, it's a pretty simple game. There is a bit of luck, and the strategy behind it isn't too complex. Feels like a race to get to the end, but you're messing up your opponents at the same time, knowing they could do the same to you in the future. Great game when you want a 20-30 min game that's simple with lots of player interaction. The art is also fantastic.

A clever and elegant card game that's easy to learn but has some unusual mechanics. The theme is centered around karma: you can play cards for points or to use their abilities, but when you use an ability, you have to offer the card to your opponent to use in their next "life". Once my family got the hang of it it played fast, and both my wife and daughter really enjoyed it. Surprisingly deep for what seems like a simple game on the surface. Will need a few more plays to see if it sticks.

RATING: 6.51
This game is excellent. The theme is unrivaled, the production quality is top-notch, and the game play is solid.

~~~THEME~~~ A+; 10/10; two thumbs up; 5-stars!
The theme is wonderfully represented by the game mechanics. The object of the game is to be the first person to transcend to the top of the ladder of enlightenment by accumulating enough karma at each stage of being.

If you use a nasty card on your opponent to gain an advantage now that bad karma may follow you as your opponent may take that card for use later on! If you only focus on doing what's best for you now you may suffer in your future life!

When you run out of cards you die and if you accumulated enough karma you will transcend to the next level of enlightenment otherwise you have to life live another life as the creature you were.

~~~ART/COMPONENTS~~~ A- 8/10
Most of the art is very nice, some of it is excellent, and none of it is bad. The cards are great - great weight and feel, good finish, easy to handle. They just feel great to hold it's almost a shame to sleeve them because they feel so nice.

~~~GAMEPLAY~~~ C/B+ 6-8/10
Simplistic but deep. On your turn you may decide to play a card for karma (points), play a card for it's ability, pass a card on to your next life, or just pass. There is a lot of strategy in which option you chose for which card, and when you chose it. The downside is the limited variety of cards makes the game feel repetitive. Not a game for those who prefer more complex games which is the reason for my variable gameplay score.

[i]Karmaka was an extremely luck driven game which didn't leave you with very many meaningful decisions to make. All of the card effects were things you've seen before, the only thing that stood out as unique was the theme (reincarnation) which fell flat for me. I know a lot of folks comment on how beautiful the artwork is, but I am not a fan of the mushy impressionism in the game.[/i]

弄別人的牌對手可選擇保留
不過遊戲要獲勝還是蠻看運氣的
還可以的小遊戲
規則:
*放置圖板，牌洗勻放中間，圓環放一旁
*每人抽四張牌起始，然後再拿兩張蓋著成自己抽牌堆，每人拿一個米寶放在圖版最下面，隨機起始
*遊戲輪流進行，直到有玩家米寶到圖板最上面勝利，每個玩家回合有兩種可能行動
1.正常行動 
>如果還有牌從自己牌庫抽牌
>出一張卡  出到面前該張上面，順序不能改，且展開讓大家看到，或是使用能力結算後，目標玩家可選擇將該牌加到未來牌庫或不要棄到中間，或是蓋著放到自己的未來牌庫
*抽牌庫有牌的狀況可不出牌跳過
*棄牌堆照順序疊起，可看前三張
2.轉生  當玩家回合沒手牌跟自己抽牌庫空時，把面前計分牌總分最高的顏色分數比對圖版自己上升一格需要的分數，如果超過上升一格，低於則拿一個圓環，所有分數牌移到棄牌堆，將未來牌庫拿到手上，如果小於六張在補牌庫的牌到自己抽牌庫直到總和六張
*支付一個圓環可加總分數一分

Beautiful game! I kickstarted this game because of the art, I won't lie. I love to help out artists with this kind of talent. Ron and I got to playing 2p and it actually works pretty well. I was unclear about the continuation of the rounds. I thought each player goes until they were dead then the new round, but it is more interesting than that. You just keep going until there is a winner. I think it is clever and I look forward to more plays of this. The actions are interesting and some good choices. It is not my favorite card game but it definitely deserves some more plays. It is so freaking pretty too!! I like it a bit!

A cute little hand management game with some cool themes and ideas that simply doesn't take off.

This game is something I'd never heard of before. Apprarently, it is a recent kickstarter. It's also a game that was designed to be two players that we played the three player variant. (I think it's probably better as a two player game.)

The art is really nice. And the theme is interesting... you're attempting to achieve enlightenment by reincarnating into higher and higher life forms (dung beetle, snake, wolf, monkey, spirit of light).

In the game there are three suits of cards, blue, green and red. Each card has a value from 1 to 3, and a special ability at the bottom. You either play a card to your tableau, to your "future life" or for its power. If you play it for it's power, you do whatever it says, then the other player(s) can take the card into their future life if they choose. If not it goes into a discard pile (from which things can come back occasionally).

Playing cards to your tableau is useful, because you need to get one suit to a certain value total in order to ascend to your next stage of reincarnation. 4 for the first level, then 5, 6 and 7 (which wins the game immediately). If you have no cards left in your draw pile and none in your hand, then you die and reincarnate. If you've reached the appropriate point count for the next level, you advance to the new level. Otherwise you stay where you are and get a ring token (which can be later spent to be a virtual point on one of your cards).

If you advance to level 7, you win. Otherwise, you take your future life deck into your hand. If you have fewer than 6 cards, you get the difference in a draw deck. And you keep doing this until someone advances to level 7.

I'm not a huge fan of race games where you can tear down other players. There are a lot of take-that cards in Karmaka and a lot of the game is about keeping other players from winning before you do. That will generally lead to a longer game where anyone who might win is pulled down by the other players. Players might run out of the appropriate take that card, letting someone win.

But generally with three players, one of the two other players can stop the third from winning. There's no way to quickly rush a win on your turn before other players have a chance to stop you. Which means, that you'll keep doing the "slap down the leader" thing until multiple people threaten to steal the win. And at some point it's just not possible to stop everyone, and you're stuck with a kingmaking situation where "doing x" gives Bob the win, and doing anything else gives Joe the win. All of this is why it's probably better as two player than three.

I don't always love take that games... but especially when it ends up being a "Keep the guy in front from winning" slog-fest. This game is almost certainly better with two players for that reason.

Also, while I like the theme of the game, there's a huge thematic disconnect between the theme and the gameplay. The way you get to enlightenment is by dickishly attacking other players and preventing them from becoming enlightened before you? Enlightenment in this game is earned by playing cards like Theivery, Spite, Swindle, and Vengeance.

Will I play again? Ehh... I don't want to play it three player again, and two player games don't get much play in my groups.

[PnP] An interesting game that involves a form of drafting to determine what cards will make up your hand on future turns while also requiring you to accumulate points during the current turn. The various 'karma' and 'reincarnation' mechanisms are thematic and fairly well-executed. There's room here for some strategy and plenty of opportunity to mess with other players (especially just as they're about to die), but not a great deal of depth and, unfortunately, the parts didn't seem to come together quite as well as I wished they would. 

Lately I find myself getting tired of games in which each card has its own special ability/action, and this particular mechanic is the main reason for my own personal reticence (and why I didn't end up backing it myself). That said, if you enjoy light games of this sort, Karmaka is different and entertaining and may be well be worth your while to check out. It's certainly better than a lot of the KS projects I've backed and I'm glad it funded.

A pretty good theme and some interesting dynamics. Not a bad two player game but I prefer it with more.

Better with three than four but still too much seating order spill. Too long for a cute planning game, because it's also bash the leader.

This game is best played with two players. You try to achieve transcendance before your opponent. 
Every player gets a starting hand dealt as well as a starting deck of three (?) cards. Every turn you draw one card from the deck and play a card. 
The cards can be played in three possibilities. You can play its effect (written on the text). If you do that, your opponent can take the card in his "future deck" (the deck for the next round.
You can put it in your future deck to play it in the next round.
Or you can play it as your "deed", that means you play it as points (values 1-3). 
To reach the next step on the ladder to transcendance, you need to achieve a certain number of "deed" points in one colour (green, blue or red).
If you got enough points, you are reborn on the next step of the ladder and nearer to victory.
I was amazed by the mechanism on kickstarter and still am. I think this could be very interesting with all the possibilities you have to play one card. You can really mess your opponents plans up which is pretty cool.
This intruiging mechanism and the extremely beautiful art are very good arguments for the game.

Absolutely beautiful artwork is the most outstanding characteristic of this game for me. Played it twice now (2 and 4 player game) and I think the game is definitely more fun in a 4 player game.

Elegant gameplay, lots of player interaction, absolutely gorgeous art. There is plenty of "take that" but the karma mechanics make it feel brilliant and thematic. The game's tactical nature and limited card variety mean that replayability might be an issue. However, it comes with interesting variants that I've yet to try.

Enjoyable, like a light LCG feel.  Not much variety, you'll cycle the deck twice in a game, but there are some fun combo's and tension between the race to the top.

Play a card for points, as an action, or to save it as part of your starting hand for the next round.

If you play an action against an opponent, they can choose to keep the card for the next round (karma!)

Marred slightly by bash the leader. My first game ended when I didn't notice leaders changing and I bashed the wrong person.

It's quick enough and has enough decisions that I'd play it as a filler.

Curious mechanics how cards move around. Planning your future hand is also an interesting option. Sadly, there are too many attacks. You win only after everyone runs out of attack cards.

RATING: 10
Top-notch art (really nice!), easy to play/teach, good with 2, 3, or 4 players (and a bit different in dynamic in each case, which is added value), card interactions largely simple to understand or covered by card-specific FAQ (or easy to sort out based on said FAQ), and the few minimally "fiddly" rules (example: leave top three cards of discard pile in discard and shuffle the rest to form a new deck) are logically necessary and easy to remember after a few games.  Highly recommend sleeving the cards with all-clear premium sleeves (maybe FFG sleeves, since the Ultra-Pro sleeves will place the foil dot right over the card text, unlike for, say, Core Worlds) -- standard US card game sleeves (Magic, etc.) x100 will give you leftover sleeves; "Pro-Fit"/"inner" sleeves can work fine as well.  A high number of interesting variables and possible interactions from a relatively low number of cards makes this interesting both to deckbuilder nuts like me and other types not so into that paradigm (have played with a few with success.)

Reincarnation themed card game.  On it's surface, it's a point-scoring game with a whole bunch of 'take that!' style cards to bother your opponents with... except that you only score at the end of your life (when you run out of cards) and you can claim cards that opponents have played for your own future life, which adds a bit of depth to an otherwise tedious genre.

2-4 players use their cards to use abilities and win points to reincarnate at a higher tier on the karmic ladder, but other players and take those cards and add them to their deck for their future lives.

Absolutely love this game. Everyone caught on quickly, yet there are all sorts of potential strategies to come up with.

Great art, very thematic, and with gameplay that reflects the theme. The future life mechanic means that this is a game about building multiple decks, discarding your previous one each time you reincarnate. A unique and engaging mechanic that keeps each game varied and interesting as it progresses. 

There is a good amount of depth and strategy to be found here as well, with players needing to balance setting up their next life, attacking their opponents, and scoring enough points in their current life to reincarnate.

Karmaka is best played with reasonably competitive friends, and it gets even better if they also happen to be Buddhists.

The game starts slowely and other players can repeat your moves and play very similarly to you. simple game, easy to understand, conversion from computer WC2 (more than WC3)

For resources and magic cards I use the rules from expansion

Game mechanics are quite close to the computer game. The gameplay is a little boring, though, and although this game has a modular setup, there aren't many scenarios.

RATING: 7
I really like this game, however some very big flaws kept it from being one of my all time favorites. The balance is terrible, especially after the expansion. Keeping track of minerals is tedious, and I hate the fact that workers can gather from any mine in the same area. Most of my games start with a quick sprint to the middle to grab minerals from neutral mines. Through all its flaws, I still enjoy it, and appreciate the very different strategies I've used to dismantle my opponents. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Not great.  Combat is fun and fairly strategic, but that's the only good part.  Rolling one die at a time for resources is ANNOYING.  Also, the 3 player game scenario included goes on forever and was very poorly designed.  After playing Starcraft I would probably never play this again.

RATING: 6
One of the earlier strategy games. Not so heavy, not so many options to choose from. I could easily recommend it as an entry level strategy war game. The design is a bit ancient, borrowing the graphics from the earlier versions of the video game, but you have to take into account that it is an older game. Anyway it is fun, fast paced. If you are looking for more challenge, try it with the expansion pack which adds some twists and turns.

A fair number of things to keep track of but not nearly as much as in the computer game.   I think this is a good translation of the computer game to board.  Games tend to be long and there are a good number of rules.  I find that it's not enough for die hard war gamers and too much for casual players.   However boardgames who liked the computer game may like this.  I know I do.

RATING: 7
[i]Posted: 8/2/10, Rated: 7[/i]

[family=4750]The Warcraft PC series[/family] is one of my all-time favorites.  In fact, I could simplify that statement by saying that I heart all things [company=11812]Blizzard[/company].  They are the only remaining software developer that won't release a game until it's ready, and I have eagerly sampled their adapted wares as well.  Getting this game was a no-brainer.  Furthermore, I am fond of letting you know when I want to like a game: I figure such infatuation is likely to creep into my comments, so in the interests of full disclosure I let you know.

Now, a hallmark of a great Real Time Strategy (RTS) game is the balance between developing infrastructure versus the execution of military strategy.  This balance is ever elusive, and made even more exquisitely agonizing in the crucible of a timed conflict.  If you're not as efficient as your opponent, then you're probably going to lose.  But board games in general are turn-based affairs: you do your thing, thinking about each and every nuance, and then I'll do mine.  What do you get when you attempt to translate the hurried chaos of RTS into the calculated environment of turn-based play?

The answer is fruit salad: it doesn't really work well.  [i]Warcraft: The Boardgame[/i] does a decent job of translating the mechanics from PC to the table: I can see the balance of training workers and fighting units, adding buildings, and buying upgrades.  A game in progress "flows" across the map like the PC game, with Outposts enabling a "proximity build:" your units can be deployed closer to your enemy's strongholds if you can build and defend an Outpost.  These are all Good Things.  But the time pressure element is missing, and the game suffers for it.  Without it, turns can drag on as players carefully consider the consequences of every possible action.

That's fine if the resource gathering and conflict resolution elements are completely predictable, as they are in [i][thing=875]Roads & Boats[/thing][/i], or in a more approachable extent in [i][thing=19600]Antike[/thing][/i]: careful planning is rewarded in each of those titles.  In [i]Warcraft: The Boardgame[/i] these elements are randomly determined.  That's a problem.  I might not be able to build as quickly if I don't roll as well as my opponent in the "Harvest" phase.  I may have to expand more quickly than I would prefer if my mines and forests are depleted early.  The delays introduced by a turn-based system exacerbate this randomness: games can drag on even after they've passed the "tipping point" of player development.

The answer of course, is simple: use a timer.  A standard chess clock suffices for a 2 player game.  Give each player 2'30" to 3'00" cumulatively for all of her phases in a round.  Stop the clock to resolve battles.  Now the pressure is back on.  If I linger to contemplate my moves, then I may not have enough time to complete all of my desired "Spend" activities.  I may rush, and forget to Harvest with a worker.  Suddenly I'm making snap decisions, and making mistakes.  More importantly, [i]the game is moving quickly[/i].  If I don't roll well, then I won't have to wait long for it to be over.

Things get even more convoluted if you have more than two players.  I have a G8 Timer, which can be programmed to accommodate up to eight players in a game.  It's a godsend in this exact situation: Using a timer, the game jumps up to an easy "8!"  However, we are now adding items which weren't originally designed into, or provided with the game.  Players shouldn't have to go out and acquire an obscure gaming accessory in order to get their full measure of enjoyment from a game.

The remaining complaints about this title are double-edged: Yes, each faction feels similar because the wide variety of units in the computer games have been distilled  down to three archetypes.  Since I zealously played the video games, I call each unit by its proper name: Grunt, Footman, Ghoul, or Druid (silly Night Elves don't have a "proper" melee unit from their "Barracks" equivalent).  This mental knowledge provides me with a layer of differentiation, but again I'm bringing something extra to the board game which wasn't designed into it.

[i]Warcraft: The Boardgame[/i] is a serviceable adaptation for the new initiate.  I'm sure there are other games that will more effectively scratch that "battle" itch.  For the Blizzard enthusiast who loves this world, and who can also bring a flexible timing solution along for the ride, then it's a blast.  I'll split the difference between the respective "6" and "8" scores this game situationally deserves, and call it a "7."

I think this is a pretty good board game implementation of WarCraft III. I even downloaded tons of extra scenarios, also in german. However, that still doesn't mean this would be a great game, only a good one and doesn't get any playtime anymore. Maybe this is actually aimed to a bit younger audience?

I've wanted a resource management wargame for a while. I have Warrior Knights and I play a lot of Twilight Imperium but both of those games are too long; this one fits really nicely in at 2 hours or so.  Good game -- even though some of the special abilities are  powerful.  Ah-ha!  Just read the errata: now that makes more sense!  (Rating goes up.)  Definitely a recommended game.

Some interesting mechanics, and a valiant attempt to recreate the urgency of the RTS computer game; but unfortunately, something just seems to be missing. There's not enough difference in the 4 races, so strategy doesn't vary much from game to game. A disappointment, I'm afraid.

A long long time ago... I can hardly remember.

I loved Warcraft and when my little brother came up with the boardgame I was thrilled (back then before I got into boardgaming).

That game really surprised me since it was a really good try to copy the real time strategy elements into a boardgame. It was pretty cool, although I think it has been surpassed by many other games.
But I would love to play it again sometime.

It was fairly enjoyable with four people as long as everybody is into the game. Too much of a straight out war game really though. Not enough variety to it. The figures are pretty disappointing too. It was an alright game that we pull out every once in a while, but it will never be a favourite. We will see what the expansions like. Haven't played in so long because we never get the urge to. There is always other games we'd rather play. Ok game if it is one of your first games. Doesn't hold up against much comparison though.

Got in a math trade. Played my first game at Mig`s place. Found the game entertaining. Game is simple once you know the rules.

Would rate the game an 8 if not for the lengh of a game. It can be a long game.

RATING: 4
Mediocre.  A few good ideas, but incredibly bland execution and generic feel.  Over-reliance on uninuitive icons (graphic design matters!) necessitates constant reference to the cheat sheet on the back of the rulebook.  Combine with uninspired scenario design and you lose all desire to dig it out or set it up.  The individual systems fit together fairly well.  The real tragedy is that if those systems were just improved by about 25%-30%, the synergy of the game would take off and truly shine.  As published though, it feels horribly rushed to market to capitalize on the license.

Played it with some parts of the expansion. My partner and me gave up after he lost the first big battle. We didn't see any chance to win.

I'm a Warcraft veteran, having spent many hours in all of the 3 versions of this PC game.
The Boardgame recreates wonderfully the context of the game and offers a true civ/war game competetive in all aspects. 
I can only understand the low rating this game has on BGG due to the fact that most people may haven't played the PC version of it and therefore devalued the theme factor.

From the start, these sort of games do not attract me. To be blunt, I'm sick of all these video game ports to board games. I firmly believe that most of the good games develop from the mechanics to the theme, not the other way around. I doubt that these kind of games followed that path.

Played one two-player game and one three-player game using the "king of the mountain" scenario. I found the latter dull and the former not so good. Will have to play a four-player game before giving my final rating. But, at this point, I'm not sure I'll bother.

I had a decent first impression. Play will definitely get smoother with multiple playings. The geomorphic hex board has potential for interesting set-ups.

I would invest my money in Wizard Kings.

---Upon more playings, it feels like there is a lot of effort to build the armies. Opponent armies are built and upgraded at about the same pace as yours. There is then a quick burst of fighting and out falls the winner. Conservative play is rewarded. An early attacking bold player will be left out dry.  The only interesting limiting terrain is the mountains. The rest , open space, mine, forest, building, give no combat benefits or subtractions. So I stick with my original assessment. If fantasy combat interests you, stick with Wizard Kings.

RATING: 7
Rather complex rules make bold attempt to capture the spirit of the original videogame. Great artwork but some weird component choices (the unimpressive wooden units look like Formula 1 cars and squirrels..???). Many errors in the rulebook (Errata available on the publisher's website is a must but it still doesn't correct all the errors). Although the rules are rather complex, there are no texts on the cards or other components, so it can be played by anyone who has read the rulebook in correct language.

Not as glitzy (read: plasticy) as other dudes-on-a-map games, but I really enjoy this one.  The game often comes down to one or two decisive battles, but I enjoy the journey to get there, even if I lose.  Just be willing to concede because once you are substantially behind, there's no coming back, and the game can drag on if you let it.  Better to call it done and start another game!  (That said, don't give up after the first big battle if you have a second wave ready to march and the opponent does not have reinforcements.)

A good rendition of the computer game. I need the expansion apparently, but it costs too much 8-(. I'm guessing that it would be no fun for people who haven't played the PC game.  I also think they tried to incorporate too many elements of the computer game in to this board game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
The base game is really a sort of advanced Risk which incorporates the need to gather resources so that you can build up your city and train and upgrade your armies. There are a lot of cool ideas in it mechanically - I love the combat system which separates the different units based on how fast they can attack and also spreads battles out across several tiles on the board. Also the resource exhaustion mechanic is very fun and the need to keep your workers in different places for different effects makes planning ahead a real necessity. Overall, I love it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Definitely not for everyone, the actual stages of play aren't difficult but the learning curve is not necessarily, initially, straightforward. It simulates the turn based strategy fairly well but it has the grand flaw of being a drawn out back and forth and losing your workers without funds to replace is crippling. There's a definite take and hold aspect which is fine but again is a back and forth approach. It's decent enough but I don't know if it's something you want to play all the time.

The gameplay captures the essence of the computer game very well, but the atmosphere is totally spoiled by dull wooden pieces. However, the worst production decision certainly was to have cards with only a useless picture, without text or even iconography. It also bothers me that there are just too few scenarios - not even one four-player free-for-all, nor an Orcs-vs.-Humans map. And the game seems to have been poorly playtested, as the revisions of special powers indicate. But at least it is simple and plays relatively fast, having been released before FFG adopted the everything-and-the-kitchen-sink philosophy of game design.

Como juego de estrategia es mas accesible / menos complejo que otros que he jugado (runewars, guerra del anillo, age of conan...) pero al mismo tiempo tiene de todo lo que hace reconocible a warcraft: acopio de materiales, construccion de edificios y unidades, y guerra por tierra y por aire. 

Lo que le baja un poco la puntuacion son los materiales. fichas "estilo euro" en madera para las unidades y una escenografia bastante plana le hacen perder "punch" frente a otros juegos del ramo. Tampoco le beneficia el factor escenarios. el juego es 2~4 jugadores, pero no es incondicional sino que depende del escenario y el juego trae de serie bastantes pocos escenarios. Factor este que le perjudica la versatilidad.

The game really does seem to reward conservative play, unlike the computer game. The randomness that I've read about in the comments certainly is there, and Nexus Ops does similar resource gathering and dice rolling things more fluidly and with a bit more depth, but overall I think that I like the game. Deciding what you want to build each turn is a bit of a puzzle, which is good.

I think I'll recommend Nexus Ops and definitely Neuroshima Hex! before this one, overall, and would probably prefer playing Starcraft to this one as well. Which is a pity, because it really isn't a bad game.

RATING: 7
Played a 2-player game (Elves vs. Orcs) and found it interesting.  Game plays relatively fast and the resource reduction works well as it forces players to be agressive.  The "experience" cards add a touch of uncertainty as you are never certain if your army is stronger than your opponent until the battle starts and cards are played.  An interesting and playable concept.  Game pieces are generic but don't impact the enjoyment of the game.  As for lenght, our first game was under 2 hours, including setup and a few rules check.

RATING: 3
This was an extremely poor board game adaptation of an excellent video game.  I played a great deal of Warcraft III, so I came to the game table with high hopes.  Hopes that were dashed completely upon playing this game.  The heart of Warcraft III is the heroes.  They are the focus of the narrative, the backbone of your army, and are at the center of your view screen for about 80% of your playtime.  The heroes distinguished Warcraft III from its competitors and its predecessors, and are the key play mechanic of the game.  The board game does not have any heroes.  What the board game does have is tedious resource gathering.  Each turn, each player has to roll a die for each peon, tally up the total resources gathered, and then count out that many chits from the pool.  This accounts for about 25% of the play time.  This is step is boring, slows down play, and should have been cut from the design.  The only reason I can think of that this step was left in the game is that it distracts from the lackluster combat system.  There are better board games than this.  There are better video games than this.  There are better board games that have been built inside the Warcraft III video game engine using Blizzard's mod tools.  Don't purchase this game unless you enjoy hours of practicing simple addition and counting out resource chits.

Initial Rating: 8.5 (December 2011)

I´m a huge fan of the videogame series and Warcraft: The Boardgame is a remarkable translation from the videogame setting, it captures the essence of the computer game, and it is very easy to teach and learn. The play time is very variable (it depends on the scenario) but at the end I feel deeply satisfied. You have to expand your territory, develop your city, secure and manage resources and hinder your enemy. It is a 4x strategy goodness with lots of scenarios. I like to play the game 1vs1 or 2vs2.
 
On the bad side (for me) is the lack of miniatures, I can’t believe a FFG game doesn´t have miniatures...WTF?  It comes with wooden pieces more suited to an Eurogame.

Current Rating: 8.5

It’s been years between since I last t played Warcraft, gladly I played it again last week and, surprisingly, I still enjoy it a lot. I say surprisingly because most games I rated an 8+ on 2011 and before are no longer among my favorites, but I still like Warcraft a lot. The game is simple to teach and play, however it can take a long while to finish with 4 players. I LOVE that when you play a 4 player game you play 2 vs 2 instead of a free for all.

The way the mines and forest become depleted should bother me because it is pure luck how much gold/lumber you get, but for some reason it doesn’t. If you deplete a mine/forest, at least you got 6 gold/lumber out of it while other players can still have their mines/forest but with less resources, I feel it can balance out at the end (sometimes).

The scenarios are great, my only concern is that perhaps there are too few of them in the game manual, hopefully the expansion or the internet has more.

Bottom line, Warcraft is a game I enjoy, I need to play more to see if the races are balanced or not, for now, my main concern is that the game can take a long time to play for what it offers, but for now I´m rating Warcraft a 7.0. A good game I’m usually willing to play. I still wish Warcraft came with miniatures.

It’s been awhile since I last played Warcraft. I still keep the game among my game collection but now it´s on my “probably sell” list. I have fond memories of it, but perhaps it can’t compete with many other games. It is now a borderline 7.0 to me. I won´t sell it without playing it at least once with the expansion.

Only decent due to its unique battle system. Resource system is ridiculously imbalanced and lethargic. Units are all the same and look really stupid. [b]'My race cars fire before your pinheads.'[/b] Why are there no heroes? It's The freakin' game is based on Warcraft III!

RATING: 6.5
A pretty generic wargame. Manual looks good but was difficult to understand (plus there were quite a number of errors). Gameplay was quite fun, but it lacks the richness of the Warcraft universe.

[Update: The expansion fixes a lot of problems with the base game. Definitely required]

This is the perfect example of when a game is produced as a way to make more money exploiting a popular license. Has some interesting ideas, but the concept fails to success as the races are completely unbalanced and the "finite resources" mechanism couldn't have been implemented worse.

Fun? Yeah, to an extent, but there are much more better alternatives. In particular, Nexus Ops, which is almost the same game, but way more balanced.

Though my son loves this game, I find it just ok.  I thought that the original real-time computer game was annoying.  However, this is a reasonably faithful boardgame translation so if you liked the original you might like this.  I did not find a great number of hard strategic choices and fun factor was only medium.

- The balance of the game seems off.
- I am not a fan of this combat system. I think I will dislike Nexus Ops for this reason
- The game lacks meaningful decisions because a lot of things are random. 
- The theme does not appeal to me and the thematic ties were poorly implemented. Rolling a die to get resources is nothing like any real-time strategy video game.

I found this game to be a blast, fast and simple war fun.  Yes, combat is sudden and feels random. Yes, getting your town over-run makes one feel like they are getting hosed. Yes, without the expansion, the player forces feel too similar. And yes, the poorly designed wooden bits detract from the flavor.  But.... it's still fun, and if played with a sand timer to stop analysis paralysis, it's a hoot!

UPDATE: The junior partner to Nexus Ops. Love it.  Simple rules, cool game play.

The first game was a lot better than I had expected from just reading the rules - a lot of elegant solutions to avoid the length and complexity of other fantasy slugfests. Second game clocked in at less than two hours, which is also very welcome. Plays nicely with two players, too. Whatever balance problems it might have had before, the new experience cards from the expansion make it even for all four factions.
Played 10+ times.

Wow, they took the RTS and sucked all the fun out of it.  

Too many sources of randomness (cards, combat dice, resource dice) and a fairly unbalanced 4 player base map.  Not fun for me.  

A couple of lucky card draws by one player on one team pretty much destroyed my team in the early game, without any way to prevent it.

I didn't get a full game in actually.  It was a learning game as I'm not great at explaining rules until I've had a chance to play the game once first.  A few turns into the game my husband got all upset because I was apparently doing well and he wasn't.  So we didn't get to finish a full game.  His issue was with the flying units that I had created and he couldn't kill because he only had the melee units.

A disappointment.  I liked in theory how you advance your race to gain bonuses and such, but in play each race plays out too similarly.  No tension.

Great theme, a bit complex mecanics (anyway, rather intuitive), full interaction, limited resource management and real war. 4 hours. Great from 2 to 4.
For those who like war with resource management this is it. This game has been misunderstood since its printing. Some don't like the wooden bits. Others the cards (solved with expansion). Others its being straightforward (gather material, build and fight). Others the videogame theme. But for me, it is just what's needed to have fun: to build your civ and make war when your position needs to be strengthen or when victory calls. Not brainburner, complex or solitaire. Recommended for people who like wargames with civ building. A bit like Tempus with war that rewards more the attaker.

I went into this with some trepidation since it doesn't have the greatest reputation these days, but I was really impressed with the Warcraft board game. Not only do I typically dislike Kevin Wilson's designs, but this captured the feel of the PC game in all the right ways. Sure, resources can be scarce, and the endgame drags out a little longer than I would like (It seems like 14 or 28 points would be a better victory point threshold to reach, depending on the number of players, but they probably rounded up to make the numbers easier to remember), but the feel of building up your troops is so well-realized here that I can't help but be satisfied.

In many ways, this feels like what Starcraft: The Board Game should have been. At the same time, I do find myself wishing that there were miniatures here like in S:tBG, but the wooden components are serviceable. Regardless, this reminds me of Nexus Ops in a lot of ways. There aren't as many troops, and battles aren't as quick and dirty, but there's that sense of holding resource-generating locations, and the combat system feels very similar. Nexus Ops may be a more exciting game in a shorter time frame, ultimately, but Warcraft has the licensing behind it, which elevates it for me.

This is definitely a game that will stick around for me. It runs a little long, but the time flies right by due to how clean and streamlined the turn structure is. Really the only reservation I have is how replayable this game will ultimately be. It's a little odd that the map setups are so static, and that 2v2 games must be done with certain races on the same sides. Again, I wish they would have taken a page out of the Starcraft board game, and included enough to where more than one person could be each race. Despite these minor complaints, I found Warcraft to be the best adaptation of a RTS in board game form. The rules are surprisingly simple, yet the gameplay is so fulfilling. I'm definitely going to be looking at tracking down the expansion.

As with most video game adaptations that aren't disrespectful of the source material, Warcraft TBG tries to be a bit too faithful to the original (here Warcraft III), to the point it resembles a really slow and content-stripped version of a computer game you'd rather play. Having to micromanage workers' travel, especially, simply isn't fun. On the balance side factions being defined by slightly different stats on units (OK, Night Elves like ranged stuff, we get it) are unexciting while swingy tech cards (good lord, the humans' healing) are a good example of the direction FFG's playtesting will take in the following years. Overall a nice and simple dice rolling combat system drowned under the whole unnecessary everything else. Also: a victory point race in my Warcraft? Seriously?

If you're somehow willing to like the game regardless of its lack of polish or innovation in a genre that has evolved a lot since then, the expansion makes it considerably better, removing major imbalances (replacement tech decks) and offering a good amount of optional modules. Those notably fix resources and add heroes/creeps who were shamefully absent from the base box, while they're at the core of the video game. Still, porting the feel of the hero's WC3 abilities has prevailed over balance considerations.

Like the computer game, players do the following on their turn 1) move workers and army units 2) get resources (gold and lumber), 3) deploy previously built units 4) spend for armies, upgrades or buildings. The mechanics are neat, but game is unbalanced (with the cards, and evil players are closer to next level of resources), it's easy to get kicked in the teeth and never recover, and you could accidentally deplete your own resources (by rolling unlucky) and get caught in a death spiral. So if you are in a losing position, you have to sit through a 2-3 hr game to really watch the inevitable conclusion. I am willing to try and play again, but those issues listed are game breakers. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
The game had pretty good mechanics, a few clever devices in regards to upgrade and play and the gameplay wasn't too slow paced or anything. I'd like to give the game a higher review but it didn't particularly feel like Warcraft.

There was no focus on heroes which alone, isn't that big of a problem, but they show Warcraft 3 heroes on the cover and warcraft 3 is possibly the most hero-centric RTS on the planet that's still technically an RTS. At leas the most popular one of that sort.

The components didn't have anything particularly Warcrafty about them. They looked overly generic and not even especially fantasy. They were too similar to the meeples found in Euro Games. The terrain had similar problems, it didn't feel like it had the look of a fantasy warfare scenario.

The game didn't try to do anything new with the board game. If you're going to make a board game based on a game, you do something that the original can't do and only a board game can. In Starcraft they made it about conquering multiple planets and larger regions of space, in Warcraft it was just the game but dumbed down--a random patch of tarrain so effectively it ended up doing the same thing as the PC game but more slowly and with less complexity and subtlety. Starcraft board game does things and gives a feel you can't get from the board game making it worth the price.

If you just want a medium weight, fairly easy wargame that's a little on the abstract side and has subtle hints of fantasy warfare than this game is for you and I would probably give it at least a 7. There's a lot of good area for strategy and planning and the combat and conquest isn't too bad.

If you're someone who wants a board game that feels even a little bit like the flavor of Warcraft 3, as the cover box shoes, don't expect this game to satisfy. It makes too many compromises and at the same time doesn't try to reach for anything new either.

Also the game has rolling for resources in a tedious way, components that seem like a rushed euro game and slow paced combat. Not super engaging or fun even though the combat system could be worse. It certainly takes too long for what it is.

This game succeeds in capturing the essence of the Warcraft PC game, and plays fairly well as a strategy board game, but a few lucky dice rolls in battle can shift the favour to one person fairly quickly and it can be quite hard to bounce back for the not-so-lucky player.  Still fun, though.

Although this game nails the theme perfectly, it is awfully dry and repetitive for how long it is. There is also something of a snowball effect in this game in terms of a "rich get richer" mechanic that makes it really hard to have a fighting chance if you start to fall behind.

OK game, The "pick one of three things" mechanic was well implemented. Can you win by getting 20 VP? Let down by Fantasy Flight and their silly symbols for reference. 

Rather random and long so I doubt I'll play this again unless I have to. Like most FFG games, you have to buy the the expansion to fix the bugs in the base game.

NB. Can be VERY long if no-one gains the upper hand early enough- you will have to deplete the whole map of resources and then troops and see what's left over!

Captures the computer game version very well, except that the Undead and the Humans are relatively the same. A good game none the less, but I prefer the computer version.

The Expansion - better, because the races play differently, but not enough for us to get it out in the last year.

The mechanism for having mines & forests run out of goods makes this game no fun for me. I've heard that the expansion fixes this problem. I'd be willing to try again with the expansion, but given how unimpressed I was with the original -- which I gave away -- I'm in no hurry to do so.

A nice and simple wargame. The wooden pieces don't bother me since they perfectly represent just what they need to represent. It helps somebody who has not played the computer game to distinguish the different unit types.

The game works well, run smoothly and combines the effects of skill and luck. Both are needed.
Well, of course the expansion is needed. Otherwise don't bother.

Simple, solid, but unexciting adaptation.  The choices regarding what to build seem like opportunities for new players to make horrible mistakes.  And other than that, it's a straightforward multiplayer wargame with different troop types, special abilities, and a ton of randomness (roll for resources, draw cards for surprise maneuvers, and roll for attacks).  I'm looking forward to trying the expansions though, because I'm a fan of the genre.

RATING: 6
It is what you expect it to be. The computer game is terrific, and the board game is a lot like the computer version. Fans will like the board game too.

It is, however, a total slug- and dicefest. Movement options are limited. You need to keep your troops close together for support. And you need to defend your town. There is a high danger of this resulting in a series of predictable pitched battles, where dice determine the result.

Train troops, send them to the front to die. Train better troops, send them to the front to die. Upgrade your troops, send them to the front to die. You get the idea.

The expansion is where all the interesting stuff is. Different scenarios, different racial abilities, powerful heroes that can 'level'. More options, more goals, more tactics, more strategy and a lot more interesting interaction.

Good translation of the computer mechanics to a board. First impression was that this was a nice, light wargame. However, when the special powers and cards start rolling the game becomes imballanced. Some of the cards/powers are as strong as those in Risk Godstorm. I can expect it in Godstorm as Risk is a drink-shout-roll game, not to be taken seriously. In Warcraft you must manage resources, build and move armies, etc. Then after an hour or two you enter a battle that has a unit with a power that can 'sink Atlantis' (over and over again). Too much effort for something that disolves with the play of a card.

Quite good light-wargame (very improved with the expansion); anyway, compared to the original Pc game the boardgame suffered a reduction in my opinion, resulting substantially poor and a bit anonimous (no names for the creatures...), but offers a good strategic challenge and some good mechanics (battle system is nice).
A real pity for the balance/playtesting problems... Fantasy Flight's erratas and FAQS are needed.
Fortunately with the Expansion Set (see my comment there) the game really shines: the expansion rebalances and completes it under many aspects. Without the expansion my rate falls down to 6.5.

This game can definetly have expansions adding different races and unit types. 
 Finished a 2 player game with my wife and it was excellent. The Orcs trounced all over my Night Elves basically due to depleting my resources very quickly and not being able to build more units. Very entertaining.

I haven't had enough plays to decide if it stands the ultimate test for these games, which is if it is still worth playing as a two player wargame eight or nine games in. However the mechanics are elegant and simple, and there are a variety of well-balanced options. Most importantly the tactical element seems to feed back well on the resource gathering rather than it feeling like the tactical part of play is pushed by the resource management aspect.

A game that I picked up hoping that it would be as good as the concept sounded.  Unfortunately, it wasn't.  Mildly enjoyable, but it seemed like there should have been more to it than there was.  The mechanics of the PC game were simplified to the point where they felt like they were dumbed-down.

I have no idea if the expansion fixes any of this, because the game hasn't hit our table in many months.

I still can't give this game a rating, having only played it 3 times or so. It's amazing how little playtesting seemed to go into making this game, what with all the broken rules and the errata, and the fact that the expansion has to "fix" half the game. Still, it's not a bad game. But there's no sense playing this if you can play Nexus Ops.

As with Starcraft, I am playing this ignorant of the computer game, but as with that game's order mechanic, there is something that feels 'real-time strategy' about the choice of commands in this game. 

I very much like the wooden squirrels, shopping trolleys and Cartmans, and would enjoy playing this more often. 

The expansion seems to be a must, certainly adds depth without overcomplicating things.

RATING: 7
One of the best adaptations of a video-game into a bordgame.  It certainly feels like the real thing and all the important elements can easily be traced.  Nevertheless, it is undenyable that it has some balance problems that I normally wouldn't forgive, but I can't help to like this design and the player implication that it promotes.  A nice multiplayer light wargame with some resource management to pull out from time to time.

Nekem a játék során a Nexus Ops jutott eszembe. Az egész játék egy végtelen hentelésről szól, semmi több. Pillanatok alatt változik a játék képe, ha rosszul dobsz és akkor el is mondtam a játék legnagyobb hátrányát. Ha a kockákat lehetne helyettesíteni valamivel a játék is izgalmasabb lehetne.

The base game is only fair- this rating is for the game with the expansion included.  The high degree of randomness in resource collection may frustrate some players, or even decide some games.  I would consider Nexus Ops to be a similar game (with a sci-fi theme instead of fantasy), but generally better mechanics.

Personally - I don't really like the fact, that it is so random. Depleting resources is just giving all the players a lot of headache...
Still - after some adjustments, game seems to be ok. And additionally - when you make a 'custom' game, it becomes even more fun. I especially like the fact, that you can make custom board and custom rules pretty easily. For instance - assume, that each peon receives only 1 resource per round per working peon and additionally - upgrade costs 6/6. This only makes it more fun. To weight it:

Overall: 5 (was seven, but seven is with the expansion)
6 - Game Fun (-2 depletion, -1 fights, -1 difficult to finish, if all players are well advanced)
9 - Edition (-1 for limited resources tokens)
6 - Random (-2 for resources, -1 for battles, -1 for cards)
7 - Game Balance (-2 not equal races, -1 not equal cards)

Edit - overall -1 having since it is too highly rated comparing to other games ;)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Not a bad game, though the more I play it, the more I have come to decide it's better for 3 or maybe 4 players (non-team, though), than for 2.  The 2-player games I've played end up being decided more by the first "big battle" - the loser typically gets set back so far it's hard to recover, which makes the winner of the battle just be able to steamroll on to a win.  In 3-player games, this tends to not be an issue, because a big battle CAN harm the winner, too, allowing the 3rd player to come in and clean up, so battles tend to be a little more cautious.

However, I think it's still a good game, just not ideal for 2 players.

don't see any reason to play this without expansion, as without the expansion the theme is only halfheartedly integrated and I'm pretty sure I would find the game much more boring. So in fact I never will. See comments for expansion, which I rate a 7.

RATING: 5
There are some nice ideas here.  I like the system, but it really doesn't work without the expansion.  The modular board is nice to look at (although the mines and the VP shacks could have been a bit more clearly differentiated.)  The exponential growth/runaway leader situation may be a problem, but it is a team wargame, so cooperative play can keep leaders in check. I feel that some of the set ups are a little imbalanced, but there is enough variability that you can manipulate the system to your needs.  I love that they included squirrel pieces for the flying units. Perhaps is a little long for what it is though...

I bought this and played it a few times and it was ok. The game seems like a lot of work to do nothing in some cases. Now that I have Nexus Ops (which is a similar but superior game in my opinion) I don't think I will ever play this again. Though I've heard this is better with the addon...

Warcraft i bought when i was a student and played a lot 
of Warcraft 3. Then i had my interest in board games on the rise as I joined a local board game club. 

This was one of those transition pieces from my video game era to boardgaming. Played only a few times, as it was difficult to bring out.....friends who were into Warcraft 3, didnt feel much for playing the boardgame. And board gamers
didnt feel like playing a video game copy. 

Eventually my Warcraft 3 playstreak waned....and my boardgame interest went into hibernation for over a decade. And this game has been gathering dust ever since.

Finally got some plays after owning it for years. It's good! Gameplay  is pretty intuitive and is simpler than a dry read of the rulebook would suggest. There are some general similarities to nexus ops, but WarCraft adds some empire building and, because it has less arbitrary victory conditions, it also allows for longer term planning. Like Heroscape, the reconfigurable hexagons mean no end to home made scenarios.

Ugh. I always avoided playing Risk with people who do nothing but build up massive armies, and only attack when succes is guaranteed. It's so very boring. Warcraft almost forces you to do this, because any early attack is suicide. And apart from that, it's just build, build, build, build, attack, build, build... Another multi-player game of direct conflict that doesn't overcome the basis pitfall of this genre: the last one to fight wins.

Based on 5 plays.  I like the theme, the port from the computer game, and  some of the strategy of the game being manage your town and your army.  I didn't like the pieces, or cards.  The resource gathering and card drawing is too random.  After a few plays the game felt a bit simplistic.  Not a terribly bad game, but just not as good as a lot of other games I could play instead. 
Note: the expansion fixes several things, including the random resources.  Playing with the expansion probably bumps the game up a point to 7.

Pretty bad.  The attempt to turn a RTS computer game into a board game is admirable, and perhaps another will succeed better.

Combat is fine, no technology upgrades is lame.

Fantastic game!  Very smooth gameplay that takes almost no time to learn.  Captures the basic feel of the computer game.  Also, it's very customizable due to the ability to create different scenarios.

I love the PC game: Warcraft.  But, after playing this once, I felt it was kind of dry.  I since purchased the expansion (but haven't played it yet).

I used to play an awful lot of Warcraft III, and must say that this game does a truly amazing job of encapsulating the atmosphere and the fun of the computer game.  Of course, you have to provide your own sound effects when attacking your neighbors town or assigning workers tasks. "More Work?","Yes M'Lord", and of course "OUR TOWN IS UNDER ATTACK!"

In the two player scenario, it takes to long until you encounter the other person. This makes the start of the game really boring. Does it get better with more players?
Move, harvest, build, move, harvest, build... I have no where important to be, so I'm just going along with what the resource die gives me. "Well I have enough to build this..."

This needs the expansion to be great.  Also do not try it with 3 people.  Our worst play-through was with three and it turned out to be a waiting game of collecting resources and waiting for the first person to attack another and then the person who was not in the war was able to come in and destroy what little was left and win.

dead boring with two players. more players might increase the tension (the resources are depleted rather fast, after all), but I doubt it would be that much more fun. there isn't much "warcraft" flavour for all you computer gamers out there, although the mechanics of the real-time strategy genre work for the most part... still, it's boring.

I feel like some parts of the game is pretty cool but that there is also a lot of things  they could have done better.
it's still  a pretty cool game but kinda random and not much skill.

RATING: 4.5
Played two times. Although I really wanted to like this game, it often takes too long to play. Units move around the board rather slowly, and when they get to grips with each other it is mostly luck that determines the outcome. Before that, the game is quite unforgiving in its strategical scope --- making it hard to get back into the arms race when you do not make the most of your first couple of turns. Although not too complicated, I wonder how easy it is to explain to a nongamer who does not know the PC game.

RATING: 6
This isn't a great game, but it's not horrible, either.  It's got some interesting mechanics, but it's very fiddly and often overly complicated, and it's in a very crowded genre.  The good thing about a computer is that it can keep track of a lot of things for me.  I don't want to have to do it myself.  Getting resources is particularly tedious, and introduces a random element that is not in the computer game.  The combat is interesting enough, and the components are, for the most part, great.  This game is decent, but it's not something I would pick up unless you're a diehard fan of the franchise, or if you see it for a great price.

Bits look good and it does seem to capture the feel of the video game. However I'd rather get a simple game like Nexus Ops that is quick and has at least a few interesting card mechanisms. This is just upgrade, muliply and kill. *yawn*

The rules indicate some intriguing mechanics to port this PC classic into a board game. The board pieces look promising. However, the visual disappointment has to be Fantasy Flight&#039;s decision to use cookie-cutter wooden pieces for all four armies, instead of using cool-looking and indivualized pieces in the style of Age of Mythology (another PC-based game).
This is clearly a cost- and price-saving move (and probably shortened production time) but I would be willing to spend a few extra dollars to have actual orcs and black elves. Zug-Zug.

I've only played this with the expansion, but I can see that the expansion adds a lot to the game, bringing it up to a 7.  I would definitely recommend (1) not playing with 3 people - it suffers from the typical 3 player disease, and (2) playing with one of the variant resource rules.  To me, the variant resource rules are a must - having one player roll 3s early in the game can kill the balance.

Not bad, but cheaply made and not much of strategy. Some of the ideas and implementations (resource collection, army upgrade) are pretty fresh but they're not enough to make this game good.

Well, this is the first game I bought with it's expansion for the price was low and since I live in South America money has to be in mind at the time of ordering something, shipping included. We had a lot of fun with this game mainly because we love strategy games and we were huge fans of Warcraft. A pity to find out that only generic wooden chips were included but we manage to oversee that at the time of playing it. It's a fast passed game with a cool system, not great cards but the imagery reminded us to the video game so we oversaw that too.

Only play this with the add-on!
The fixed resources are a major help.
Addition of the hero's is quite nice as well :).

I bought this game because I'm an incredible fan of the Warcraft 3 RTS game for the PC. I fel for the license. The game itself it not that great. It's mediocre at best.

The game has a kind of slow build up, which doesn't work that well for a boardgame as it does for an RTS game. Combat is a bit dull, with special cards to add spice to combat the blandness (Get it, combat dull combat?). But the cards don't feel very special.

You can upgrade your units, which is very useful, but most of the times it means that the do more damage. No special rules or stuff here most of the times.

You have 4 different factions to play, but they are pretty similar on stats and available cards. They are feel like minor differences, which in the end all play similarly.

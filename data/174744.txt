I love Geschenkt (No Thanks!) so this one was not a difficult choice to buy.  I really like the game and possibly the only thing about it is the length - would it have been better shorter or longer?  But I'm not sure about that either because good games of around 40 mins are a rarity.  I expect people will be split on the length issue.

There are normally 3 (and often 4 things you want to do: take the coins, place a depot, take the card as a share (sometimes sell shares).  This makes it very tight and you can easily be stitched up by what someone does a place or two to your right.  This makes for a very tenses and tight game.  Not knowing excalty when the game will end (a bit like The Downfall of Pompeii) is also another tight mechanism.

The game may well go up a point when I've played it more.

When to buy? When to sell? When to pass? In my opinion this is an excellent easy to learn, easy to teach game with lots of player interaction. The only con I see is that colours aren't that different to distinguish.

In spite that I prefer fantasy/science fiction games, Mogul still entertains me (and my friends!) a lot...

Auction game with some interesting options for the players. It takes about forty five minutes to explain and play. The wooden bowl is a nice touch.

RATING: 6.5
The turn mechanic is a bit confusing at first, but quickly resolves itself. By the end of one game, the basic strategy is apparent. Plays quickly. You basically betting on when you'll be able to cash in your stocks before someone else beats you to it, while also betting on when to go "all-in" with your chips and when to cash out. Theme is very thin atop a wagering game, but fun.

For those that haven't played this game, Mogul is a wonderful light/filler auction game. During the game, players are bidding for cards that have two actions (1. Obtain stock 2. Sell stock or place depot). The player who wins the auction chooses the action and 2nd place gets to do the unchosen action. Thus, there is an element of deduction as players attempt to either benefit from the unchosen action or position themselves so they pass with more money in the pot. Furthermore, the stock the card gives is always different than the stock that it sells. Thus, cards often are relevant/important to every player. And because of their limiting nature, players will often attempt to buy cards to either protect their own stock value or prevent another player from selling their stock. Finally, there is a push-your-luck element in the game as players get points for holding onto stock throughout the game but want to cash out before the game end. 

All of that may sound a bit confusing for a filler... but you can teach this game in 5 minutes and it provides a fluid/interesting experience. There is luck in this game and players are often hoping a particular card will come out before the stock market crash (always last 4 cards), but the game plays so quickly that it doesn't bother me. 

For those that are familiar to the original game, this version adds an option to the sell action (aka... place depot), which makes the sell action relevant in the early part of the game. They also added a large wooden bowl, which makes it hard to see the amount of money in the pot. I'm just going to assume the factory had a bunch laying around for cheap... because the addition of that component makes no sense.

Wow, I can't say how impressed I am with this "little" train game.  Definitely a gem.

It's a perfectly streamlined introduction to stock ownership games, with the critical but remarkably un-thinky auction mechanism.

The combination of the unique auction method, the cards and the board rarely leaves you walking away from a turn empty-handed (although it can happen), which makes it fun for beginners as well.

Highly suggest for people looking for something meatier than For Sale or No Thanks! and intrigued by the likes of Chicago Express but looking for something a bit less cutthroat.

An odd little unique filler auction game that's a bit unlike anything else I've played.

Players bid on cards, tossing a coin in the pot each time it comes around to them to stay in the running for the card. When you pass, you get whatever coins are in the pot. Each card has two possible rewards, and the winner of the auction gets first choice of what to do with the card, with the runner-up getting whatever the winner didn't choose.

You can choose to accumulate shares to earn dividends, sell those shares, or to set up stations on the board that will score more if you build large groups of them.

There's also a fair bit of card counting involved, as you'll often really need to ensure certain cards are still left in the deck, or you're totally screwed. The bidding can get pretty intense if players realize it's the last card of its type in the deck, and multiple players really need it.

Overall, just a nice, quick auction game that has some unique elements.

This game has a press-your-luck element to it with the bidding element, but it doesn't feel entirely rewarding.  Most of the time, I felt like the game generally played itself with some minimal prodding from the players. That's not to say there weren't interesting choices to make, but they often felt obvious.  Maybe it's because we played with a full compliment of 5?  I can see that perhaps a smaller number of players would offer a greater feeling of control, but I won't really know as I doubt I'll have many chances to play this again, if at all.

It's not a terrible game by any means, but I find that the stakes of gambling aren't high enough for how much you can potentially dump into the cup.  For that, the payoff needs to be much bigger, imo.  I dunno.  Maybe the gambler in me simply doesn't agree with this game haha

To its credit, the game plays very quickly and doesn't require a lot of investment from anyone.  It's a great pick-up-and-play game, but it left me with the feeling of, "...so what?"

RATING: 6.5
As with most simple auction games, I like it.  It's accessible, easy to teach, quick setup, fairly clean, functional art.  Most importantly, as with Ra, extremely simple choice of action leads to difficult decisions.  

For me the main failing is that once you've sold most of your shares, you may have nothing significant to do in the game for twenty minutes, while the tail end of it plays out.  This happened to me in my first game (yes, I sold at the right time, and won quite easily as a result).  I don't mind being out of a game, but others might not like that optimal play is rewarded by a "holiday" from the game.

Also, the route investing on the board seemed fairly irrelevant in our 5-player game - too much contention for people to have a chance at the bigger returns from the exponential curve.  Perhaps that part is more signifcant in a 3-player.

Érdekes licitmechanizmus, de kicsit fura táblás és részvényes működés. Tipikus Schacht, olyan majdnem jó játék, de valami sosem stimmel, de a rövid játékidő és a licit miatt szívesen játszom vele máskor is.

RATING: 7
Mogul has a couple of neat things going on in it which makes it a pretty full "filler" game (though I say 'filler' as in "a game to pass 40 minutes", but the strategy isn't light at all).  It's an interesting little game as players must try to maximize their returns the best they can while really staying on top of each other to prevent leads as points earned grows exponentially. I can't think of another auction game that feels this quirky, given the three actions you can take when you are in 1st or 2nd place. It feels quite unique for a "standard" bidding game.  Though honestly, I bought this game on spot because not only does it have Schacht's name on it but it comes with a wooden bowl- a large, wooden bowl for cryin' out loud! Thank goodness there's a good game here too.

I played this with my wife and parents and I seemed the be the only one who enjoyed it. I had a similar experience the first time I played No Thanks!, which has the same bidding mechanism. I like the bidding mechanism but apparently it isn't for everyone. This game was like No Thanks! with more interesting decisions and a little more depth. I'd love to try this again with one of my game groups to see if it goes over better.

A market game with a thin veneer of railroads on top of it.  Ultimately it's a bluffing/push-your-luck game where you hope that your opponents will not pass before you, and will not sell before you.  Everyone wants to wait to sell, but doesn't want to wait longer than the other guys. Great stuff.

The rules may be simple, but the strategy and best plays are opaque. This game is another in the stable of big-games-in-small-boxes, and I will rarely turn down a game.


One of the most fun playing pieces I have ever encountered is the 'begging bowl' included in this game. Hearing the 'plink plink' of money tokens falling into this little collection bowl is supremely satisfying, as is taking all the accumulated wealth to the groaning of the opponent to your left.

Pay chips to stay in, sort of like No Thanks. Drop out and take the chips, for future bidding. The last one standing gets a choice between card and action. The last one to drop out gets the unchosen option. The big points come from being one of the last two standing. We were kind of muddling along, so I'd have to say more play is needed to form a solid opinion. (Note: The original version of Mogul was published before No Thanks, so I said Mogul is like No Thanks, but it's really No Thanks is like Mogul).

Fun, light and fast-playing little stock game with an auction mechanism similar to that in No Thanks.  Definitely will consider purchasing.

The bowl that comes with the game at first appears nice but is just cumbersome.  Because it is made of wood, players are unable to easily see how many bidding disks are in the bowl.  Additionally the shape inside the bowl does not allow a confident grab when scooping out the disks.  We ended up putting the bowl aside and just putting the disks in a pile on the table.

Picked up at "The Compleat Strategist" in NYC. A very fun little auction game, I describe it as the lovechild of For Sale and No Thanks! (although it came before No Thanks), mainly because I plan to play it with people who I've played both of those with as the next step up. Lots of tension in the bidding and the strategies are quite interesting. A lot of game in a little box!

Takes the bidding idea of No Thanks, turns it up to 11, and builds a game around it. The game is essentially a very light stock trading game. Timing is everything, and while the bidding feels a little tacked-on compared to everything else, the game has a lot of interesting decisions.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Initial impressions (with four players):
- wooden bowl seems unnecessary, but creates a very real tactile presence when bidding/passing
- control bidding chips can feel cut-throat
- limited catch-up mechanic

If some of those comments sound negative, they aren't meant to be. It's a tight game. I rather enjoyed it, although wish it was a bit shorter.

Even though there is a clear transition between getting value from collecting shares vs selling, the auction process never changes during the (roughly) 40 minutes you play.

Suspect it would feel very different with different player counts because of the way two people benefit from each auction.

Az utolsó két játékos húz csak hasznot az egész licitből, a végső győztes dönti el, hogy a megszerzett kártyáról melyik akciót hajtja végre, a térképre állomás lehelyezést vagy a kártya, azaz a részvény megtartását.

An interesting bidding game. There are enough different options to make interesting decisions but not so many that you can lose track of what is going on. There is a lot of interaction between players, but very little "take that" moves where you can screw someone else over. It plays very quickly too, which is nice.

Has No Thanks bidding (although apparently the first edition predated No Thanks) and wraps it into a more meaty game. Getting either 1st or 2nd in the auction still being viable because as 2nd player you get to do what the 1st player did not is really neat. I also like how you can tell exactly how many opportunities you'll have left to do what you want to do since the cards of a color all have the same secondary action. Additionally, the sell action removing cards from the table and making other players score less is a pretty mean and nasty mechanic, and makes winning certain auctions extra tense.

However, while I still really enjoyed the way the game played, I kinda had a bad experience with it. I was sitting to the left of a player who really enjoys hoarding resources in most games, and way too often in this game, he would exit the auction and take all the chips, even if there was only 1 or 2 chips in there, and leave me with absolutely nothing, and by halfway through the game I usually had no chips and was forced to get out early in every auction and couldn't hope to compete because that player kept taking chips away almost every time.

I was lucky to get 1 or 2 chips at that point. Meanwhile he was able to stay in for a couple of important auctions and he got second. But because of that he did go out early for an important sale where one person removed sold three of their cards instead of him, bringing the 24 points he would have earned with the sale down to a mere 9 points, so he did lose the chance to win the game himself by his actions, so it's not the best strategy. But while he didn't win he was effectively able to cripple me in the second half of the game and I had a pathetic final score (I scored almost no points outside of some early depot placements).

That being said, it's still a really fun game, and there was a lot of laughs had by what happened in this game, moreso than a lot of auction games. Just be careful of playing this with people who love to hoard resources (people who just draw two cards off the top of the deck for the first two thirds of the game of Ticket to Ride, for example).

In Mogul, each player begins with an equal amount of bidding tokens. During a bidding round, a cup is passed around the table where each player wishing to continue to bid for the action that round will place one token into the cup. If a player wishes to drop out of the bidding round, they get to take the accumulated bidding tokens into their inventory. The cup continues to be passed around, until the last player is standing. It is often times just as important to pass as it is to win the bid, as passing is the only way you can regain bidding chips. There is a certain ebb and flow to the game that you have to attune to to be able to make the best decisions.

I often feel the bidding phase of the game is the real meat of the game. The cards, the stocks, the map are all there to service the auction phase.

That ebb and flow of the auction is the true beauty of a game like Mogul.

1 play, 3er

This is an old game, updated and reprinted. I'd never played the original version. This is the same game, I think, with two additions: the board (and depots on it), and maybe some change in how to sell stocks? 

It's a very good little stock game! It plays quickly, has decisions throughout, and just a dash of luck -- not unexpected in a stock game -- in the order that cards come up and when the game ends! The auctions, with players passing the chips amongst themselves, is tense (especially if you lose track of how many chips each player is holding)! It feels a lot like No Thanks! (which I [i]played[/i] first, but was actually published [i]after[/i] the original Mogul), but with stocks and area majority (of sorts). The stock speculation bit -- should you sell now, or try to wait until your shares are worth more? will the game end before that last share shows up? will you even be able to win the chip auction when that key card comes up? -- keep you interested throughout. And all this in a quick, filler-length of game ... well done!

[b]--- Rules Summary ---[/b]
Players each start with a bunch of bidding chips, their player markers (houses), and a set of stocks (varies by player count; all 5 colors in 3er) face up in front of them. The rest of the stocks are shuffled, with the game ender (stock crash) in the bottom few cards of the deck. On your turn, reveal the top stock from the deck. Everyone earns $1 for each of their shares of that color. Then auction the card: to stay in, toss a bidding chip into the pool; if you pass, take all the chips in the pool. The winner takes one of the following choices, then the last player to pass takes the other:
1. keep the share (add it to your display)
2. Each stock share is associated with a DIFFERENT color (indicated on the card). Either sell ALL your stock of that color, or place a house in an available space of that color on the board. If sold, shares are each worth $1 per share of that color in all players' displays. Mark $ on the score track.

The game ends immediately when the stock crash card is revealed. For final scoring:
- $1 per remaining share in your display
- $1 per 5 bidding chips
- each house on the board is worth as many $ as you have houses on that color line (i.e., for each of the 5 color lines, square the number of houses you have on the line).
The player with the most money wins!

Interesting simple auction game.  It feels a little drawn out for what it is, but it was enjoyable enough that I'd try it again.

Imagine wrapping a game around the game of No Thanks.  That's what you get when you play Mogul.  Brilliant and easy to teach.

[b]Be sure to read the "Credit" section on the last page of the rules.[/b] I assumed that this was just the credits so I ignored that page, but was left wondering why I had so many extra chips in a game where the amount of chips is limited by player count. There's actually a Credit action you can take once per game.

Michael Schact continues to have a perfect record with me (I've played Coloretto, Han, Hansa, and now Mogul). Of his games that I've played, they all seem to create a simple gameplay system that utilizes unique scoring mechanics to make the game interesting. They tend to play fast and be slightly-more-than-filler weight (except Coloretto, which is completely filler-weight), which are the perfect type of game to play when you're not in the mood for something too heavy but you still want a thoughtful experience.

This game is a nice take on the "No Thanks!" gameplay system. You "bid" by discarding a chip, and when someone passes they take all of the discarded chips. So just deciding when to pass and when to stay in the round can be important. There's a novel mechanic where the winner of the round gets to choose an action to take, but the second-place person gets to do an action as well. So sometimes staying in the round just long enough to get second place can be a good move.

Really fun, really simple, and a good amount of tension for what amounts to a souped-up filler game. I really think the game's success is hindered by the dull, grey look. If it were rethemed to be more colorful (a Coloretto theme would be nice) I think this game could be a hit. As it stands, it's still a hit with me.

Solid great simple game. It is the predecessor of No Thanks, and this incarnation rocks! No idea why you need the wooden ball ... but it is there!

Same rating as original Mogul. Different rules from what I remember: the board of course; that shares at end of game are worth a point each; and uniformity of shares such that shares of a given color are identical (always offer the same, other color as the second option).

Not sold on the board being good. At the end of the day stations are just a second path to getting VPs. It dilutes the focus. And you don't score those VPs until the end of the game, meaning you can't trust the scoring track during the game unless you do some additional math. You can win without putting anything on the board; the effort you would've put into doing that can just go into acquiring shares instead.

A supposed potential advantage to having the board is that it makes it more valuable, more often, to place second in the auction. I'm not sure why that's such a good thing, though.

The basic strategy with the board play is to place as many of your stations as possible on the same color track. If two players try to focus on the same color, they'll both probably be hurt. This is a pretty standard variety of majority game. This is less interesting than what goes on with the shares: If two players are collecting the same color of share, the potential value goes up for both, and it's timing of sales that determines which player will benefit more.

Yep, Schacht is still the master of the 45 min streamlined euro. I'm always impressed by his ability to craft tension and enjoyment from binary choice systems.

Wasn't sure what to expect here. Small box, small game board, small bits, huge game. Very strategic for the game type. Very unforgiving. Some paths to victory much more powerful then others. Deeper then it appears

I mean...it's fine? It certainly isn't a bad game and the stock/action decision is interesting, but the train portion definitely feels bolted on and it doesn't do anything much better than other auction games. Nice bowl though.

RATING: 7.5
Cool little bidding game that has a fair bit of nastiness to it.

When I read the rules, I got the impression that it would be a bit dry.  Boy was I wrong!

Lots of glaring going on as we dropped bidding chips into the bowl.

Mogul wants to be a 20-minute filler, but instead it's stretched out to 45 minutes - with only a few mechanical wrinkles to bridge the gap.

Random issues:

The cup design is dumb.  Either the cup should be clear plastic (so that the coins are visible), or it should be eliminated and the coins should be replaced with flat chips that are tossed into a common pile.

With five players, some players repeatedly get stuck passing with 0-1 coins in the pot, due to the scarcity of cash.* The game might (?) be improved if the starting money scaled with the number of players.  (More players = more money per player.)  Or, it might be improved if I never played again.

Finally, the endgame is extremely swingy, depending on the exact moment that the "game end" card appears.  In each of our games, a different player would have won had the endgame card appeared one card earlier/later than it actually did.


*The first player, for example, is always tempted to pass the first time the bidding comes back around; at that point, the cup will contain 5 coins, which is a significant amount compared to the 6 coins that s/he started with.  One could argue that that's the core mechanical tension in the system, but something still Isn't Quite Right with the current version of the game's economy.

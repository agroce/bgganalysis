Of the 'chewing-gum sized Chris Handy games' this one isn't too bad. You move your 'bus' around by playing cards, picking up and dropping off passengers. It's really no more than a shared puzzle experience - the tension created by the race quality of the game. It's ok, but not great and not something I would recommend to play.

Cute tiny game to stick in a pocket and take along. Plays reasonably fast on a restaurant table, train seat, or wherever you happen to be waiting for a while. Those little cards look and feel great!

RATING: 7
This is a solid addition to the pack and is notable for showcasing just how different a game can be with a "common" framework.  While the game is a card game, it does not play as such by a long shot.  It's a good game and plays well and balanced with 3.  Pack-o-games continues to deliver.

A light weight pick up and deliver game.  For the size of this thing, you get a pretty interesting game that I could see playing from time to time.  This doesn't do anything new other than its small packaging, but I did have fun playing.

Tried at OrcaCon 2016 as part of their Play & Win area (a really great idea). After returning it to the table and encouraging someone standing beside me to try it because my little group enjoyed it, half an hour later I won it in the first drawing of the weekend!

Quite a bit of strategy packed into a tiny little box, around the size of a gum box really, and definitely a perfect game to toss in a bag to play at a pub while you wait for your food.

BUS is a really nifty game tucked inside a small package.  I like how players move around the route picking up and dropping off passengers as they go around.  It's nice to be able to unpack a game, explain rules and play all in about 15 minutes.  It's nothing you'd build a game night around, but for a quick filler or while waiting for dinner at a restaurant, it's a nice little game when you have 2 or 3.

I have largely let the micro-game craze pass me by, but I think even this is more micro than most. I remember seeing this game in a math trade and had no idea it was this small. The remarkable aspect here is the size and how the cards are used. The game play was not unpleasant, but quite pedestrian.

Street cards are laid out in a random four-box grid. Three streets have bus stops, six have passenger destinations and one has a construction site. Players drive buses - picking up passenger cards at bus stops and dropping them off at destinations. Every passenger card holds two passengers of different colors and have speeds from 1-5 and are worth points from 5-1. After you pick up some passengers you drive around the grid at the speed of your slowest passengers dropping them off. When one player has completed 5 passenger cards everyone gets another turn and the game ends. The construction site allows you to swap two cards once in the game. It's a very straight forward race for passengers and destinations, balancing points and speed. How the cards are used to represent the different game elements is more interesting than the game itself.

Very basic pickup-and-deliver game. The balance of the cards seemed super random, as the only variables were that enforcing a stronger speed limit led to more points. I don't know...this is fine, but if I want to play a game of this genre with such a small footprint, I'll stick with Great Heartland Hauling Company.

UPDATE: Decent game when using the advanced variant. Would probably still rather play GHHC though.

I wasn't sure that I actually liked pickup and delivery games. I worried that they seemed to easy and simple without enough to separate players. However, this tiny, pack of gum game was actually fun. This is fantastic news to me, since I recently backed Mint Delivery. I will likely like that more since BUS is probably the more simple version and I'll enjoy the extra depth. Time will tell, and I was happy enough with BUS to play it again and again. It's portability and quick play make it a great game for on-the-go to play just about any time or anywhere.

A fun pocket-size games that requires you to randomly build a 2x2 grid of streets on which your bus will travel to collect passengers printed on the street cards. Target passengers, number of moves permitted (i.e. speed posting), and victory points awarded upon completion are all indicated on the objective cards. As you reach each passenger, you slide your objective cards from left to right to indicate which passengers you've already picked up. Game ends after a certain number of cards are completed and then players total their vp as indicated on completed objective cards! Very smart use of minimal components!

Of course, we all LOVED the form factor here, but there's actually a nice little game in that pack! It's a nice little introduction to this line of games, and a nice intro to pick-up-and-deliver, too! It may be a bit luck-heavy (flip of the card), but the game is so quick that it may not matter very much anyway!

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
It's simple game: there's a random setup of roads + 3 bus stops + 1 construction site. There's a deck of passenger cards, with a face up display of 2 cards. On your turn, move your bus up to your max speed (lowest number of all the undelivered passenger tiles you've collected), delivering passengers if you land on OR PASS their street. If you end on a bus stop, you can pick up a passenger card (from the deck or either of the face up cards). If you end on the construction site, you may (ONCE PER GAME) switch the locations of 2 streets (neither of which currently have a bus on them).

The game end triggers when someone has delivered 5 passenger cards; everyone else gets one last turn. Then, you score VP according to the passenger tiles you've finished -- most wins (tiebreaker = turn order).

I was very uninterested in these "Pack O Gum" games when I first started hearing about them.  Mostly because micro games, with a couple exceptions, are really uninteresting to me.  There is something to be said about a game that can be taken and played almost anywhere but I'm just as okay with socializing in other ways during those times and playing games when I'm meant to play games so that appeal is somewhat lost on me.

This was the first of these games I played.  The game consists of several long, thin cards (about the size of a pack of gum unsurprisingly) that make up a grid of streets.  These are put out randomly and contain bus stops, colored drop off locations, and one construction space.  On a player's turn they move their bus.  If they end their turn on a bus stop they can pick up new passengers.  The passengers need to be dropped off at two different colored drop off locations.  Once dropped off they score points and the more points they score the fewer spaces the bus can move during a turn.  The construction space can be used once per player per game to switch two unoccupied street cards.

I was about as unimpressed as I expected.  It's certainly not a bad game and I suppose it can be commended for what it can accomplish in such a small package.  But the game can be, and for us was, completely determined by luck.  I started the game going first and able to get a 5-point (the highest point total but lowest speed limit) passenger card with the two drop off locations right next to me and follow it up with another 5-pointer where I only needed to travel one more space than the first one due to the random setup and kind of won the game within the first 5 minutes.

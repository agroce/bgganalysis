I feel like this game has been hiding from me all these years. Otherwise, how did I miss it? I got the base game as a Christmas stocking stuffer, played it once, and immediately purchased a second copy along with all of the expansions. I LOVE that this is a deck builder that actually allows you to attack each other directly! Can it get any better? Maybe, but this immediately became our family’s go-to deck builder game.

[I]tl;dr Star Realms is a decent deckbuilder with a peripheral sci-fi theme but great interactions. The authority track is an especially great addition to the game.[/I]
[COLOR=#CCCCFF]____________________________[/COLOR]

I was introduced to Star Realms after my father-in-law picked up Colony Wars at GenCon and wanted to introduce me to it. He's logged hundreds of plays against AI opponents, so I knew I would get blown away, but it presented another chance to learn a deck-builder, so I took that chance. 

In Star Realms, you are trying to buy ships and bases to activate powerful actions that will let you, well, buy more ships and bases. Like most deckbuilders, there's a lot of repetitiveness in Star Realms that can get old. However, I did appreciate the game's main point: siphoning the opponent's influence down to 0. This makes the game feel incredibly personal and strategy choices have far-reaching effects. 

Timing is everything. I was able to beat Tim down to only 4 points at one time, but his superior cards and VP-generating capabilities let him quickly recharge and proceed to steamroll me. If I had collected myself a little better, I could have made that one big push more efficiently. This optimization part of the game definitely appeals to me, since I'm prone to be excessively tactical and optimize individual turns, without a longer-term strategy. Star Realms forces you to do otherwise. 

Since playing with more players, I can say that the strategy shifts with four players as you're trying to beat other players down but eventually just finish one or more of them off. We found that we'd generate ridiculous game-ending combos off of each other and shut each other down. So, like most deckbuilders, this ends abruptly. 

Ended up trading it, didn't do it for me.

I'd placed more than 10 kickstart orders and Star Realm is the first one arrived in full at the promised time frame. I'm not just looking forward to play the game, but will also look forward to other kickstart games by the same publisher. Well done!

Played the first games today, it can be learned in 5 minutes for gamers, and even non-gamers can easily grasp it. Fast paced, well balanced, love it!

A year from receiving of the game and it's still my favourite. It has replaced bridge to become my daily mobile-phone game, and still enjoy it very much after nearly a thousand plays (mostly on mobile). And looking forward to the mobile version of Epic, though I love the card game.

Very similar to Ascension, but the game play is much smoother.  The use of iconography instead of just text and the artwork is significantly better.  I also enjoy the fact that you always have a target for your attacks (your opponent) instead of it being a randomly drawn monster.  The attacks also have more of an impact as it directly affects your opponent.  It does play very well (read best) with two, but it also played well with four in 2 vs 2 teams.

This is a solid game, and way better than most deck-builders, which usually just have you count up points at the end, like Ascension.
I found that a card was missing from my trade deck when I bought and opened up my first copy of Star Realms. I figured out which one was missing and emailed White Wizard Games about it. They actually mailed me that one card for no charge within a few weeks.
White Wizard Games truly lives up to their name, this is a company you can trust.

Star Realms imitates Dominion but is designed for two players only. However, Star Realms is inferior by almost every aspect. In Dominion you at least get the satisfaction of analyzing the setup, deciding on a strategy, building your deck and seeing your game plan come to life. None of this exists in Star Realms, though. You cannot have a strategy, since you just have to choose from the cards drawn from the deck. All plays are made at the tactical level without a long term plan. Moreover, the round has a tendency to end even before your marvelously built deck has shown its crafty potential. You do not get a chance to show your cunning. All you need is just a small deck of cards that deal a good amount of damage, and the game is over in an eye blink. You do not even want to buy any further cards because it just slows down your fast rotation of cards.
 
A poor game, trying to take a fresh approach to deck building genre by ditching strategy, most of decision making, and the thrill of building your deck. Honestly, I cannot understand the appeal of this game. If you like tactical level games that end quick and can be played without giving the game much of a thought, Star Realms might be your cup of tea. I just find Dominion more appealing offering something for both, the strategists and casual players. 

And it is not even that I despised tactical games, on the contrary, I love many of them. But it is just the fact that after buying a few cards, you just dash for the finish line without doing any more decisions.

Not fun. At the beginning there is a nice slow build up, but then it just seems to go nuclear on a dime. In most games I have played, rather than there being a back and forth and a close finish, one player is able to put together a monster turn for an ungodly amount of damage and wipe the other player out.
While this is completely within the rules, it feels kinda unsatisfying, even for the winner. It is more of a sense of "oh, I guess that just happened" shrug, rather than a sense of accomplishment from victory. it just seems to me that in the mid-rounds is when a deck-builder should be hitting it's sweet spot (you having fun with a lot of combos or moves from the cool deck you have built) this one will end abruptly.

The best deckbuilder in my opinion.  It elegantly sidesteps all the problems that usually bug me in the genre.  This is a game where you MUST build a deck that makes effective combos of cards to do well, but unlike other deckbuilders, a careful player can almost always do so, and none of the mechanics of the game fight against your ability to build the deck you want.  The tradeoff is that it really only works with two players (I'm not a fan of the multi-player variants, most lifted from Magic, detailed in the rules), but I usually play this type of game with two anyway.  One of very few games that I'm pretty much always up for playing.

I haven't played many card engine building games so I cannot compare them to each other.

The positives for me: science fiction theme, fast play, highly competitive, attack cards, cool combo cards.

The negatives for me: the scoring cards are a PITA (although you can come up with your own scoring system I suppose). Variability relies on expansions (= $). Fells like I am playing the same game over and over again by which I mean it feels like a re-themed Dominion. That's a not a bad thing and I am probably a little off with the comparison but the feeling remains.

I'd play an app or computer version but don't think I'd play the card version all that often.

So 7 for the app version and 5 for the card version leaves me a 6.

RATING: 8
I got the decks and then bought the app.  I have way over 2,000 plays on it and this is one fabulous game.  You can play it in about 20 minutes: 5 on a phone.  It is a challenging with a lot of strategy in a small package.
Don't believe the noise about luck of the draw and obvious choices.  If you think that is true, get the phone app and play the A.I. on the difficult level.  You have to know the value of the cards beyond their cost and how they fit into your deck.  You have to develop a strategy, as chaining same-faction cards is extremely powerful and each one has its advantages.  You have to realize that sometimes you shouldn't spend "money" that you have to acquire ships, just because it is there, as deck-cloggers can kill you.  You also have to know just when to trash a card and take the chance that you can pull off the win.
Greatest filler I have ever played: hands down!

This is a great first deckbuilder -- the randomized trade row makes it less strategic and more reactive and tactical than Dominion-style deckbuilders, but the short length of the game means that it's not awful if you lose to card draw. Balance between the suits is questionable, but again, for a game this light I'm not sure how much that matters. I have a few of the blister pack expansions.

RATING: 2
There were more choices than I thought - but just as little control over the outcome. 

Effectively, this is a game about pacing - you try to either ramp up your spending to acquire more efficient threats or you cash in and go into all out attack mode. Unfortunately, the 'drafting' row - of only five cards - doesn't allow you to craft much strategy, and quite frankly, doesn't even allow you to be positive tactically enough of the time. 

I think Ascension, online, was worth some play to learn the limitations of a fun set, but this is the same deal, but the online implementation is weaker. 

The shuffling would be a big problem if I played this in real life.

Deckbuilding was never this fun!
It's great that every single card you can buy has the potential to do great things, contrary to Dominion where victory points just pollute your deck (which does not bring you any fun at all)

I hate deck building games. But amazingly, this game was fun. Though the mechanics are similar and simple, the random confrontation battles are refreshing and quick. 

Comparatively speaking, it can never be a war-ish game. The battles do not allow 'responses'. It is a matter of UGo-IGo system. So it resembles a chess game where players do their best with whatever cards they have at that time. 

Good simple family game.

Star Realms is a highly engaging deck-building and drafting game with very few flaws that should replace the bulk of your existing deckbuilders.

QUALITY:
The card quality is serviceable for a few games but quickly wears down to the point of needing sleeves. The game is fairly cheap, so it feels a bit weird spending upwards $5 to sleeve a $10 game.

ART/UI:
The UI by Vito Gesualdi is pretty good in some places. The symbology makes sense, is easy to remember; the body typography choice of Handel Gothic was classy, and the colors have good pop and compliment the art. I would nitpick that the overuse of beveling does detract from the card design and makes it a bit tackier.

The art is pretty superb in most cases. You have a few instances where cards are clearly just a bunch of separate pieces thrown together in Photoshop with glows and filters added. However, most of the art is top-notch spacefaring stuff with lots of added color to keep you engaged and keep cards looking memorable.

GAMEPLAY:
Gameplay consists heavily of drafting. This will be roughly the only decision you ever make in the game: which of these 5 cards do I take (that I can actually afford)? Tons of incredibly complex game situations spring forward from just this one simple starting point. You can talk for hours about how many "levels" of nuanced play a player can learn after each game, such as knowing to pick up scrap cards to thin the deck, scrapping starting Viper cards first, knowing when to loop your deck and when not to, knowing what cards will make it through less deck loops, and knowing how to both create your own damage trajectory as well as counter-draft an opponent. There's a lot more that goes into the game that wouldn't be appropriate for a review, so let's just say that it has an insane level of depth that you could be exploring for a year or more of solid play.

THE BAD STUFF:
Every game has a flaw and Star Realms' is randomness. No matter how good at the game you get, an opponent getting a Trade Bot in open is going to set you up for a huge disadvantage. If cards bottomdeck (appear on the bottom, thus getting to use them one less time) uncontrollably too often, you can lose through no fault of your own. Between two highly skilled players, much of the gameplay comes down to who went first (first player has an ENORMOUS statistical advantage) and what picks were available on the draft conveyor. Even when you do everything in your power to control the game by limiting your buys and crunching numbers for hours to learn the best choices, the game can just take a fat dump on you for a loss. The only upside to the randomness in the game is that you should almost always be able to beat someone of a lower skill level. However, expect closer skilled players to have a lot less fun, especially ones that hit the skill ceiling of the game. Once you hit that ceiling, the game feels like pure random chance.

VALUE:
You get at least a solid years' worth of play in a $10 or so package. That's some intense value you shouldn't pass up even if you dislike the genre. I don't think I've seen a better value game in board gaming history.

CONCLUSION:
Star Realms has to be one of the tightest, most engaging, most highly replayable games I have ever played. It is nearly perfect in game design and looks decently sleek as well. This straight replaces several other games in its own genre. The only reason I can't give this a 10 on BGG is that the rating system precludes any game which I would stop loving and once you hit that skill ceiling, you stop loving just seeing randomness be the dominant factor.

Buy the game anyway.

A good, strong, easy to learn game. Everyone seems to enjoy it, that I have seen.

The only demerits are:

1. While battle adds a slight element of interaction between players, it's pretty easy to play with a mindset of "well whatever's on the board when it's my turn is just what's on the board". It doesn't really feel like you're competing against someone else because fundamentally you just buy whatever's best in the market and attack as you can. The game doesn't really allow for a player to create strategies, such that you would need to care what the other player is doing and react to break it. As said, you just buy what's best and move on.

2. If I remember right, the rules have you down from 20 HP. At that level, who wins is basically just luck and the game ends before you've barely even got started. I recommend playing 2 players to 70 HP each (we always just shortcutted it and started with 68, ignoring the first two damage).

It's a good game to play on my phone to kill some time, but that's about the extent of it.  Very random, and with some interesting decisions but not a ton (and often decided by luck of the draw w/rt bought cards).  Also the packaged Authority cards are godawful.

Unless I have been playing incorrectly, you end up playing every card in your hand (no choices) on your turn so the only real decision making a player has is what to buy (not on what you play); because of that, I think this the game is only "ok".

My 11 and 9 year old daughters think this game is great.

Addictive 2-player deck building card game with nice Sci-Fi theme and artwork. Rules are simple and gameplay is fast and furious. The base set has enough replayability but you can always buy one of the small expansions if you want to spice things up.

Game takes around 20 minutes to play and we always play 2-3 times in a row. There are enough different card compilations to try out. it may not be the deepest of games but it is exciting and highly addictive.

A decent lite deck builder. I played a lot of this on my phone. I just wish the factions felt even more different.

Didn't try this game for a while because of the deck-building mechanic--but my wife and I were pleasantly surprised.

Had a great time even when I had to watch my powerful fleet go down in flames.

Delightful little 1-vs-1 deck pooling game, incorporating new ideas and mechanics from other games to set itself apart from the likes of Ascension and Dominion. At it's pricepoint it's a steal. Add the Crisis expansions later on to mix things up and keep playing Star Realms for a long time.

This game is easy to learn, but plays on mechanics that have been redone over and over. Cards have cost, colors, attack, life. Players have life. Like every other TCG since MTG.

Maybe because it relies on those repetitive mechanics it is easy to learn, but it is very luck based, there is little strategy if you are even moderately good at card games, and just that: a filler (that can sometimes even take long).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Objectively a great light deckbuilding game. The small packaging, short play time, and depth of play make this a great time filler or travel game. 

That said, Star Realms is incredibly derivative of other deckbuilders, especially Ascension. Is it... better than its immediate competitors? Perhaps, but it still makes me feel strange giving them my money.

Yes. Yes. We know. Another deck builder? And a sci-fi themed one at that? Indeed. This one gets high marks for being a simplistic game of attack and recruit. "Core Worlds for Dummies" if you will. We tried Core Worlds before and were totally gob-smacked with how mathy (nope not a word either but you get the idea) it is. The game should come with a calculator. But Star Realms takes the concept of building up forces in your armada/system to attack your adversary and makes it so simple it's almost obscene. LOL. That simplicity and ease of play is what puts it on the same level with Eminent Domain. We don't think you can go wrong with this one.

This game is very very very very average. 75% luck, 15% good fortune, 2% strategy (but ranked 50 odd on stategy list lol) & 8%....... er......... well I guess you could call it 'skill' but only if you threaten to punch me in the throat. Lets call it 'correct decision making' ability. If thats your idea of fun buy this game. The one major advantage it has its that is generally so obvious, after 12-14 turns who is going to win, if you are playing with a friend who knows the game well, one of you can concede and you get get through 8-16 games in an hour. Sure every now and again (1 in 5-6) you might be able to pull of a win despite this but really what the point? Usually that's often down to terrible/great card draws etc. The decision making is so obvious you'd have to be a brain dead mouse not to figure the best option 90% of the time. Very rarely you'll get 'tricky' choices but they are rare. I suspect if you played the app game and asked the company to provide you with a computer AI copy and a simple modification, you could get a heavy book to play the game for you and simply make the odd obvious decision that's required. The game feels often like your along for the rid, whether you win or lose and the game is playing you rather than the other way round. I have to hand it to the game designers though to provide the illusion of choice and tactical decisions for people whilst it sreally a very simply 75-90% luck fest, is pure genius. Wish I'd though of it. All in all I just dont get how this game is rated so high but I guess we all have blind spots.

There was a time I really enjoyed Star Realms, so much so I played the card version, the iPhone version, etc.  But, the more I played, the more I started to see that it was truly a game that rewards experience.  Now, what game doesn't, right?  But, with this game, I felt like if you took a casual approach to it and attempted to play with a more serious gamer, you're toast.  I saw this a lot with a gaming partner of mine who played(s) this non-stop on his phone.  I took a break for a while and picked it back up.  He destroyed me.  I feel like there are paths to victory that make themselves evident with time.  Sadly, this disparity has decreased my overall opinion of the game for this reason.  Perhaps selfish, but it's my review.

Star Realms really surprised me. I had only heard it in passing in a Rahdo review before someone bringing out their set at Kingdom Con. I love Dominion & deck builders and always am willing to try a new one. I thought that this felt like a lot of games already, like Ascension with its multiple currencies and how you buy new cards from the common pool pulled off the big deck and Legendary with its chaining of hero power activations. The life total and attacking people directly with one of the currencies felt fresh enough that it stood out. The game also has space stations which act as buffers that have to be attacked first or add special abilities. All in all I had a great time and really enjoyed the multiplayer variants. We did 2-headed (2 on 2) and a variant where you only attacked to the right; both lots of fun. The game is also cheap enough (~$16?) that I'll definitely be picking up a copy. My criticisms is that the number of ships available often feel very limiting where there is typically only one or two real choices to be made and later in the game your deck is mostly playing itself as you draw (which is a criticism of any deckbuilder but I felt it here more than most). This automation may be worse with repeated plays, but I definitely had fun while I was playing it.

The latest update to the iOS app is brutal.  Thanks for saving me from wasting my time playing it, I guess?  Moreover, too often I find the game now becomes predictable after the first 3-4 turns.  This is frustrating when you can see you're likely just managing what will ultimately be a loss.  It was fun for a while though, and the first 4-5 games we played were the best.

Fun, fast deckbuilder where you have these different space empires duking it out (my preference is for the Blobs).

2/4/16:  Need to try some of the solitaire varients described in this geeklist:  https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/189611/star-realms-solo-challenges.

11/22/14: Deckbuilding card game.  This is Ascension set in a Sci-fi world.  The 3 different resources are attack points, purchase points and victory points.  You start with 50 victory points and first one to go to (or below?) zero loses.  In essence a built in countdown.  

Fairly quick playing.   A big bonus is that unlike 20 dollar card games you can purchase a 2 player deck for $10.  The downside is that the deck box will disintegrate quickly. 

I think the playing time is longer than 20 minutes, but we'll see when I have more plays.  Plays excellently with 2, haven't tried it with more.

RATING: 6
Star Realms is a fairly fun deck-building game. It is pretty straightforward, but it does offer more direct conflict than most deck-builders. It is a fun little filler, but some of the cards seem a little unbalanced. Overall, it is a fun and inexpensive game, but I think that some of the accolades for it are unwarranted. It is a good, but not great, game. It has no business in the top 100.

A deck builder. The thing to aim for is certainly combos - activating the same faction cards really boost your options. The problem is since you only draw 5 cards you have to get rid of some cards, and that isn't that easy or fast to do. Usually red faction cards allow you to scrap (trash) cards, and yellow cards allow you to draw extra cards hopping to get that one faction you really need.

Dominionos pakliépítés, de sokkal szórakoztatóbb: téma is jobb, és változatosabbak a kártyák. Mondjuk tehettek volna bele korongot, mert az értékek növekedés-csökkenésének folyamatos jelölése enélkül macera. Cserébe viszont barátságosan kicsi a doboz, gyakorlatilag csak egy 128 kártyából álló paklit tartalmaz.
Nálunk mindig az nyert aki az outpostokra ment, és a gyengébb lapokat kiszórta. Ami nagy előny, hogy lehet fordítani. Egyik partiban a győztes 3 körrel a vége előtt még 3-55 hátrányban állt!!!

Tried out MTG and found the chase a bit frustrating. I appreciate the accessibility of this game. The mechanics are very streamlined and easy to teach, but strategy can have a lot of depth.

This game is quick and easy to throw down and play, and it has great depth. I've never played a faster deck-builder, and none other quite has the advantage of being so fast to set up and tear down.

I've only played solo and two-player, so I can't comment on how it scales from there. Solo is endless fun, and two-player is very intense.

Star Realms is another take at the deckbuilding genre by the same designers of Ascension.

It shares many things with its elder relative: a variable and ever changing row of cards to acquire, the presence of just two "currencies" (money for purchasing and military to attack), the powers triggered by playing cards of the same faction.

What is different, then? The answer is simple: it is a bloody, fierce, fast and furious duel! Each player struggles to knock off the opponent, by reducing his life from 50 to 0.

So, unlike Ascension you don't build military to defeat monsters from the center row, but to outright crush your opponent.

Another difference lies in bases: they're permanent assets (well, permanent until destroyed, anyway!) capable to provide resources during many turns, and also give players some protection (outposts).

All considered, it's an improvement on Ascension (even if the iOS app is worst than the Ascension app), with a more streamlined design, and much more tension. And it plays definitely faster!

Heard much about this and I decide to give it a try. I must say that the art is very nice, though I am okay about the theme. (Maybe, I speculate, I have been playing a little too much of the space theme games, Eclipse, Eminent Domain, Core Worlds.

I guess, I still prefer the others to this even though I would think this is a pretty cool card drafting game. Maybe a few more plays will give me a better idea.

Oh,  I'm sorry you didn't pick yellow cards initially to add to your deck. The other player did and unfortunately for you there's an endless stream of them coming out for him to choose from (and he keeps getting them clumped together in one hand). Never mind. You loose. 
In all honesty I've had my money's worth from this one but over time it's become more and more frustrating. Too luck dependant for my liking.

Easy to learn/play deck-builder with plenty of player interaction.  Best with 2, can support more with big expansion.

Don't care for the business model as the little booster packs don't add much individually.  Wish they used more of a traditional board game expansion model for business rather than one that feels like an LCG.

Simple deckbuilding game, easy to teach and play. Reminds me of yugioh/mtg. Seems like if you're evenly matched, it comes down to card draw. Initial buying availability can really determine the game as well. But all in all, a really good short two player game

RATING: 8
Fast, simple, and offers some excellent decisions.  Sometimes I get a bit frustrated about dying super quickly to massive amounts of Blobs, but the games are so fast regardless, that you just shuffle back up and start again. I definitely recommend NOT using the cards-for-health if you are playing in a situation where you can even just write down health. I understand why they used them for the game so it can fit in the box easily, but they just get annoying whenever you have a slightly complex addition/subtraction problem.  But I really enjoy the cleanness of the game.  It's excellent.

Sci-fi themed deck builder. A few different races or fleets to choose from, if you try and stick to the same 1 or 2 fleets you will build better deck synergy and if your opponent doesn't you will most likely win.
These game is easy (teach) & to pick-up and play but takes a few plays to develop a decent understanding.
I own 2 physical copies for now (in order to accommodate more players).

Mainly played the app but like the physical game too.  I like the ever changing market for cards and having to adapt your strategy accordingly.  Lots of different approaches to take to the game.  Good mix of luck and skill although it doesnt have the variety of Dominion I havent been overexposed to it yet.  The design works perfectly for 2 and the 3/4 player variants are a welcome addition but do not excite me.

Fast paced, original card game. Starts out a bit random, but if you can survive the first few rounds your deck-building tactic becomes more and more important. If you play too much, you'll find you won't improve that much anymore. You can't beat that bit of randomness to become better at the game.

UPDATE: Got bored of the base game enough that I never sought out the expansion(s). Rating dropped.

OLD COMMENT:  Base set is a 6. Luck of the draw is pretty critical, and the faction synergies create boring incentives.

The mechanics are a nice evolution of standard Dominion-style deckbuilding. With expansions, this could be elevated to an 8.

This game is phenomenal. There are some cards that are better than others, there's luck, there's a little strategy, but what there is a lot of is fun! I love this game. Went on vacation and played it like 12 times in one weekend. So good. 

EDIT: dropped my rating from 9.7 to 9.0, its still a great game, but it does lose some replay-ability over time. I have played it a lot though, so that's understandable.

RATING: 6.5
Average deck building game but I like the quality and the theme better in Legendary Marvel/Villain sets.

This is a bit too bland and generic.

Its strength is its cheap price, but I really find it a time waster like so many other Eurogames.

The mechanics are done better in more thematic games.

Rating is lowered because the latest card expansions brings the game even more down into an uncontrolled snore fest.

There is a reason why this game is marketed at the lowest pricing bracket.

The masses will enjoy this, but heavy themed gamers will drop it rather fast.

Within 2 years it will drop out of the top 300, as should be.

Star Realms is a surprise of a game. I was first introduced by watching some friends play. The game just felt and looked cheesy.

High rating because of how much my family loves this game. My 13 year old actually wakes up early every day before school so that we can play a game before he leaves.

The expansions aren't necessary. The base game is really good by itself. But if you play this as much as we do, then having the expansions is fun.

Just wish they would sell the extra player cards separately. Felt silly buying a whole extra deck so that we could play with 3 or 4 players.

A 2 player only (at least my version is) deck builder that works surprisingly well. It is really easy to teach this. I like the tug of war of trying to beat down your opponent while trying to stay alive yourself. Some super powerful cards in the deck can lead to monster turns. Just be sure not to use those craptacular cards for life points, they suck big time. We use poker chips.

first two plays were solo against the two included solo challenges in the newest set of convention cards purchased at origins. It is very enjoyable, and this particular route can be explored nearly ad-nausem for which I am glad, I will look to play this one both two player and multiplayer as soon as possible. The game leaves a nice clean feeling of just simple fun when you are done and that has me very excited for the future of the franchise.

This is a solid, easy to learn deck builder with a fast setup time. It's focused on combat so should be welcomed by those who think Dominion (to which Star Realms owes its roots) is multiplayer solitaire, although it should be noted that Star Realms involves a lot more luck than Dominion.

The game isn't very thinky. If a card is strong or belongs to a faction for which you already own a few cards and you can afford it, you generally want to buy it. And when it comes into play, there's not too much to think about. Resources are money, attack power, and defence (healing). 

The game is fast and pretty fun, but it's not deep.

This game is fun with little staying power.  If is fast and furious.  It is small.  But, there are deck builders I like far more.  I can't tell if my purchase was worth it or not at this point, but it is not my favorite game. With more variety, my rating may improve a bit, but it just does not have the fun power I like.  

I think it is because the cards allow you to attack, buy, force your opponent to discard, gains you health points, discard cards out of your hand or discard pile, and discard hands out of other's hand.  While this is fun, it has not proved to be fun for long. 

I see this as the optimal young boy game.  There is lots of attacking, and it is very easy to grasp.  For the rest of us, it gets old quick.

Rating based off the pc app but the score will be applied for the physical version.

First.People complaining about the luck.Get over it.Its a card game.

I had always problem with deck building games.For me deckbuilders are just a luckfest and not entertaining at all since the deckbuilding mechanic bores me to death. Even if you try to put more gameplay mechanics around it{like thunderstone}it makes the game even incredible long and the setup times are even longer becouse you need more cards,boards or even dice.

After my bad experiences with thunderstone.Better but not cheap legendary and easy to teach mechanicaly swift dominion{which i liked the most}.Well here comes star realms.

Cheap little addicting PVP deckbuilder in a little portable box.For my friends this will be a huge beer&pretzel game for the pub probably.
We dont need freaking big overproduced boxes for a deckbuilder.I dont think that the mechanics are so huge.
Star realms i hope will start a new trend in this portable deckbuilders.Cheap,small,more PVP,quick and still a lot enjoyable.

EDIT: lowering my hyped score 9 to 7.still too much luck for my taste.sitting and waiting for the big lucky combo fo half life.This is the last deckbuilder for me.

still i cant get lower with this for its pricepoint.

RATING: 9.5
This game has steadily grown on me. Maybe it was an 8 early on. Now it's a 10. I just can't get enough of the game. I find it fun and very, very fun when you trigger multiple cards into play and build up a massive attack. Also there is more strategy to this than meets the eye. For a while, it was a game of luck that I always lost at. I have had to raise my game. I like that you have plenty of quick decisions and that it plays fast, with no AP. I like the expansions too. Really, I am happy to play the base game endlessly, but it's fun to freshen things up with Colony Wars (I want to try a blend with some core, some Colony) and the various other things. I like that Gambit can be used to give a handicap system. Simply give more gambits to whoever needs a helping hand. Heroes I like the idea that you can use them to trigger faction abilities on single cards. Just a really great, play any time, any where game, that also has a very addictive app. For the price, it is a remarkable game. On the minus, to players who do not like take that, it can feel like relentless attack. Other than that, a home run for me.

"Update"
Bump to a 10.  Such a great "comfort" game.  I never don't want to play.  Play quickly and smoothly.  So easy to teach.  I love how the theme (space warfare) jives with the mechanics (Fleets taking turns launching offensives versus each other's home worlds).  The only way I could think it could be "improved" thematically would be for ships to have some defensive capabilities, although I imagine this would hurt the games playability, which is near perfect, in my eyes, at this point.


"Initial"
Good: Easy to teach, theme integrates well with game flow, a plain fun experience, short play time, very good price.

Slight concern: might be too easy to over play the game. Might not be enough difference between various cards to keep the game fresh for long.

Fun 2 player game. Guy friends love it. Although deck building strategy seems quite limited and certain cards are way overpowered (red's brain world).

Still trying to grasp the game play of reactive strategy, rather than building a fixed strategy.

- Red is deck thinner
- Yellow is deck cycling/discard
- Green is for massive damages, cycling (secondary)
- Blue is hybrid for healing and cash and bases

- Red/Yellow is good with any colour

- Freighter (blue) can be surprising good early/mid-game to buy expensive stuff
- Explorer is pretty good early-game for buying expensive stuff and mid-game to cycle damage when one has nothing to buy (and doesn't want to open for opponent).
- Recycling station is good in event of a bad hand

There are so many deck-building copies that I haven't liked, but this is one I enjoyed my first time through. It seemed to have the right amount of simplicity along with familiarity, but also uniqueness from other deck-builders. I liked how the goal was a bit different than what I've seen before... destroying your opponent's health and that you can bolster your own health on your turn. I'll play this again.

Our staff just couldn't put this one down!

Many of us are ex or current M:TG players, even if you have no experience playing in the world of CCGs, Star Realms is still quick and easy to pick up.

The art is literally out of this world (no pun intended) and the gameplay is elegant and simple while still allowing for a decent depth of strategy and planning much as in CCGs, despite the cyclical nature of it being a deck-builder.

Blob are a bit strong but we've seen them taken to task by lean and efficient Federation/Empire combo decks.

If you like great games with deck building, then stop reading and go buy Star Realms. It's brilliant for how small and simple it is. The only thing keeping it from a 10 is the swingy nature some games can have. That happens rarely if you are playing with someone of equal skill, but it happens a bit too frequently for me to warrant a perfect score.

I own the following

Its okay-ish for the price and game length. But this game is far too random for me to really want to play it. 

If person A gets a few good hands of cards in a row while the other, person B, gets subpar person A can just dominate the game.

I’ve never been in love with Magic or any other deck builder but I’m really stunned by how good Star Realms is: it’s simple, fun, addictive and it even has a gorgeous science fiction theme.

RATING: 8
Initial Impressions:
-----------------------
Whoa!  Really neat take on the deck building genre.  Like Ascension, except that it is PvP, while also offering way more interesting deck building decisions.  I really like this as a 2 player deck builder so far.  Interested to try the "Raid" mode with more players.  If you enjoy deck building games, and 2 player CCGs or LCGs, you are probably going to really enjoy this game.  The artwork on this is amazing. Oh, and you simply cannot beat the price on this one (I picked up a copy for $10).

Lasting Impressions:
-----------------------
There is zero reason to play Ascension anymore, as this game just beats it down in every way.  For a 30-45 game for 2players, I cannot think of many games I'd rather play.  This is a game I will be playing 5 years from now, and  something I will continue to play whenever I get the chance.

This is like Ascension but more fun. Fast, furious, just enough depth to rally sink your teeth into. On the  bubblegum to ten-course degustation scale, it's somewhere above a packet of chips but below cafe brunch - so maybe macca's? Filling but still fast food, but still sometimes exactly what you crave.

RATING: 9
Fast setup. Quick play. Exciting decisions, intense gameplay, easy rules. It's missing some more strategy to be a perfect 10.

On the other hand there's a bad balance between efficiency of push-your-luck card building and generally efficient cards, i.e. push your luck strategies are strong, but too unreliable. This is especially true for counter-strategies, that depend on the fact that you're allowed to buy certain cards, which deepen your core strategy. My problem with the game is that the efficiency of buys depends on the future availability of certain combo cards, which when drawn might win you the game. For example if you pursue a blob rush strategy your winning chance scales with the appearance of certain cards and the possibility for the other player to counter you depends on that as well. This leads to some frustrating games, where choosing the correct tactics and strategy still results in a clear loss.

The "solution" is to not rely on any such strategies and instead buy cards, which are strong in general. Those cards will be bought immediately, when they turn up and you can't influence who gets those (unless they're particularly expensive), which is ... frustrating.

Ok so I will add more to this....I have played it probably 30 times with my game group and everyone who is introduced to it loves it and wants to play it over and over again.  

I cannot say enough great things about this game.  If you want a solid, small, quick deck builder look no further....just go ahead and buy two copies so you can play with 4 people...BUY THIS GAME!!!

Love this game. Have to admit I mostly play this on the app, but love having the card packs as well. 
Whilst this is a simple and a very luck based game it is a joy to play. The various factions have plenty of personality and you can really build up chains etc on actions. Highly recommended either in physical or app based.

This is a great filler game. Simple, quick, easy, and fun. It takes about fifteen minutes with two players.

As with many deckbuilders, the game seems to end just as you get your engine going.

Deckbuilder combat. Interesting encouragement of deck specialization, without requiring it. Fairly easy to explain: there are a few details that can be easy to gloss over at first, but become important later. I like it, and I like that it plays well with different numbers of players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Star Realms is a great example of being perfect for what it is.  It's designed to be a 20 minute exercise in deck building, and it accomplishes that perfectly.  The art is great, and the game space is just large enough that the four factions feel unique.  The game focuses almost exclusively on the choice of what to buy - or not buy, as the case may be.  Keeping your deck lean and focused is the challenge.  The deck then pretty much plays itself, and I think this is where the game gets a lot of criticism.  Detractors want meaningful decisions in how they play the cards, and that's just not present (with the exception of when to use scrap abilities).

Star Realms is a fantastic buy at the price point, and worthy of being in every collection as a short 2 player filler.  It's not a brain burner, and it's not meant to be.  It offers a light and short game that is accessible and fun.

I bought Star Realms to play with my 7 year old, and he loves it.  It has quickly become his favorite game.  He plays fairly well, and although I sometimes have to point out how to optimize his hand, he has already figured out how to guide his deck with his purchases.  I highly recommend Star Realms for smaller gamers.

Like a streamlined Core Worlds, without the cost-escalation ingenuity of its "sector" model but with a very satisfying feeling of conflict. Really fast.

RATING: 7.5
wins over Dominion by more streamlined real life play with less action counting etc. Still strategically interesting and engaging although the trade row might be your enemy at times.

update after many plays: Had to lower my rating. Unfortunately with more games under my belt the really interesting game courses seem to be in the minority. Often enough the game between equally strong players is determined by early luck of the draw.

update after more plays again: gets better with inclusion of Colony wars with overall better balance. Still you have to avoid year 1 promos, especially the Ark und to a lesser degree breading site.

Seriously, I thought I liked this at first, until I realized how predictable it was. If you follow a "script", you can vastly improve your chances of winning.

I think i'm just not a fan of White Wizard games in general.

Dominion in Space. Pleasant, light and addictive game that plays quick and fun. My only issue with this sort of game is there is a limited amount of skill once you know how it works.

Mi primer juego de deck building y ha sido todo un acierto. Mecánicas sencillas pero entretiene bastante. Las partidas son rápidas y las diferentes facciones hacen que los combates sean distintos cada vez permitiendo giros. Por ejemplo puedes pasar de perder 50 a 10 a ganar si tienes el mazo bien preparado. Para lo que vale muy muy buena opción. Estoy deseando que saquen las expansiones para ver si consiguen llevarlo hasta el sobresaliente. Una de mis mejores opciones para dos jugadores y menos de una hora de tiempo.

I have it on my phone as well as a hard copy of it. It is far from my favorite game ever but it is really nice as a phone app. It is much quicker than most deck builders but it isn't balanced enough for me to want to play it during a board game night. It seems like it boils down to luck once you have gotten a hang of it, the person who gets the good card flipped on their turn (or the end of the opponents turn) is going to dominate. 

Brought down from 8 to 6. Not playing it on the phone as often anymore.

Deckbuilding for dummies. Not that that's necessarily a bad thing, but since the game is over in 10-15 minutes, there are very few long-term strategic choices to make. Luck is also a huge factor here, with some players happening to get a couple of good combo-creating cards which they can then use and reuse until they win. I think I'd probably like the game more if it was played to 100 points (rather than 50). 

As others have said, the scoring cards (with different values on each side) are a nightmare. They are incredibly confusing and present a huge risk for game-changing scoring errors. Use poker chips instead.

:thumbsup: [b]POSITIVE POINTS:[/b]

++ Nice compact deck-building game, that have direct players interaction.
++ Good replayability from the different card that show up in the trade row and from the 4 different factions that have different style of play. Every games, you can set up a new strategy using the different combinaisons of cards available.
++ Good card graphic design, that is clean and clear.
++ Really fast to set-up and super fast to play.
++ There is several expansions available for this game (which is useful to refresh the game when we have overplayed it).


:thumbsdown: [b]NEGATIVE POINTS:[/b]

-- Since this game have an exponential game speed curve (it's maybe too fast), it seem that if you have a bad start (too slow to acquire the right cards or to thin your deck), you already know you will be loosing and winning just past the half game (so it's a clear runaway leader problem here), which is sad. But since I'm playing this game exclusively with the app, it's so fast that it doesn't matter me much.
-- The replayability of this game is lower when always played against the same opponent (as it would be in my case) as part of the variability is how the players play the game and what strategy they try.
-- The game start to feel samey quickly too, even if you haven't try all the possible combinaison of factions or card combos yet.
-- The space theme, the direct player interaction and the fact that I already know how to play this game, all this makes it a no-buy for me as I mainly play wife my wife, and all these things will turn her off, so it's a "Don't buy" game.

RATING: 8
I've now played Star Realms a bunch, and while I think it's a good game, the problem for me is that it's just not as interesting as Ascension on any level - graphically, gameplay-wise, etc. Plus the multiplayer has a lot of problems - the co-op versions are particularly bad - while Ascension works fine with 3, even 4 (2 is still best, but you can at least play it with more). I played out the base set plus mini-expansions in about 30 games, which is actually great, but I just don't have any desire to play it anymore.

Anyway, the head-to-head aesthetic will appeal to some people more than Ascension, but in most ways it's just an inferior copy. Which still makes it quite good - but just not as good.
---
Really grown on me. The iOS version is a very poor cousin to Ascension in many ways, but like Ascension, Star Realms is a great iOS game. IRL it's a little less awesome, and rather swingier than Ascension it seems, but still quite a lot to like. The multiplayer rules look intriguing and thoughtful, looking forward to giving them a try.

I am thoroughly enjoying this game.  After hearing about it being the "Hit of Origins" I needed to purchase it.  Grabbed it for the MSRP of $15, which is a lot cheaper than what some people are paying for this game!  Zero regrets.  A deckbuilder that easily plays in 15-20 minutes, with a lot going on. You need to play with what comes out, but it's easy to get some sort of strategy together.  Try and keep it to certain factions of ships/bases.  Get some bases to soak up pain.  Get a nice little engine to beat down your opponent.  I am interested to see if the game has legs that can last through multiple plays as well.  A tough competitor for my game of the month.

2 Core Sets + Gambit Set + All 4 Crisis Packs (Events, Heroes, Fleets & Fortresses, Bases & Battleships)

Great way to spend 15 minutes. After buying all of the expansions, it pains me to say they are not necessary- base game is better alone, because it's portable. With everything, it becomes too much, not-portable, and you lose a lot of potential plays accordingly.

Ascension, but faster, first to 50 VPs wins. So fast that luck of the draw, which can be frustrating in any deck builder, and luck of the purchase tableau, which can be frustrating in Ascension, are magnified.

Also, the tightly interwoven factions means that unlike in Ascension where you can choose between faction cohesion or just a mix of great cards, you have to stick to your factions. And, luck rears it's head again if your faction cards just aren't dropping into the purchase tableau.

A fun and addictive little deckbuilder, despite a few imperfections.

The faction/ally system is interesting even though it does admittedly make the strategies pretty straightforward. It still packs quite a bit of tension into a really short, fast-paced experience.

This is the first deckbuilder I've played where you and your opponent are not offered the same cards for purchase. This raises the luck factor a bit, but is the only way I can see a truly combat-focused deckbuilder work without stalemating and makes for some fun tension (the "oh god I have to buy that so he can't" mentality).

This also isn't really the most balanced game. The yellow faction in particular seems incredibly powerful as there's really no good counter to their discard ability.

Another drawback shared by all these small-box deckbuilders is that the game does lack the kind of replayability that something like Dominion has where you're NOT using every card every game. And because this is a little more straightforward than something like Valley of the Kings... well, you will basically see everything the game has to offer after only a couple of games. Usually I wouldn't recommend a game where that's the case BUT despite that it's actually seen really consistent play for us. Thanks to the short playtime, great in-game pacing, and sheer fun factor this is actually gets pulled out on the "we haven't played this in awhile, why not do a quick game?" basis.

Oh and side note: it sucks that there's not support for more players out of the box, but at this price point it's hard to complain.

Took me awhile to try this with 3 & 4 players and I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it, but we did have to house rule something for 2v2: [b]do not play with shared money[/b]. Shared money only encourages people to build up one person's deck as fast as they can while disregarding their partners' almost entirely. It's way too easy to win this way and it's simply not fun. By retaining shared health, but not currency, this issue is largely fixed.

The only thing that kind of sucks is that bases tend not to stick around in 2v2 for very long, since you're doing massive quantities of damage. Sort of wondering if base values should be upped a little, or something. But again, for a short and not particularly deep game, this doesn't bother me.

Update: Colony Wars is out! Hooray for not having to buy two of the same game just to get to 4p!

Got this game from Kickstarter campaign in December. Played this game several times and immediately did not like it. I would rather play Ascension in any form this game and I really don't like Ascension. I hate the attacking the other player without defense. At least Dominion has reaction cards that can protect from attacks. The gema has really good art but game play is so based on luck that it takes away from the fun. Traded this game to my brother.

This is certainly one of my favorite card games ever created. The balance and the randomness just seems to hit the sweet spot for me.

I like that each faction has different strengths; still exploring how to use each one best.  

Not sure how much strategy there is, beyond "buy good stuff that interacts".  Each hand seems to play itself, with the only really interesting decision in what to buy.  I guess that you could argue the same thing about Dominion, but at least in Dominion (which I love) you have more control about what you're buying and the cards interact in more interesting ways.

Quick paced deck builder.  But unlike many other deck builders that are usually based around "what can I do to my deck to make it generate the most points", this deck builder is a "directly attack your opponent" kind of game.

I like this game quite a bit.

Star realms makes me think of a faster, slicker Core Worlds. As a deck builder, it feels very to familiar to that style of game. I do like the powers that trigger if you have played a card in a matching faction on your turn. That commits you down certain building paths to get the most out of your cards. I'd happily play again.

This is a hard one for me to rank. I'm not a fan of deckbuilders because I hate counting every single turn as it really takes me out of the game and all I feel like I'm doing is adding stuff every single turn. In that way it feels no different than Dominion as instead of counting coins and actions you are counting trade and attack. As a card game it's probably a 4 because it just feels like math homework to me. 

However, I've found playing this on the app to be great fun as I don't have to worry about the math and I actually feel like I'm building my space fleet and either attacking my opponent or defending myself. As an app it's probably an 8 as it really has the addictive just one more game feel and I wish I felt the same with the physical version.

So I'll average this to a 6 and likely look to part with my physical copy assuming the expansions end up coming to the app as well.

UPDATE 8/15: In the end, no. I just don't see the edge of deeper decision making that elevates this beyond the category of slightly amusing pastime. It's virtually impossible to devise a meaningful strategic plan at the start of the game (given the information you have and more critically do not have), and there are virtually no interesting decisions to be made from hand to hand.

You play your cards and you take what drops off the conveyor belt and in the end someone wins. It's fine, it's a pleasant distraction when I want to be half-engaged in something, but not a great game, or even a good game, if you're looking to be challenged by difficult strategic questions. You could maybe rig up a pseudo-LCG from this by drafting a subset of the deck and making it your personal trade row, but why not just play a proper LCG? Or if you're not hung up on the deck building thing and you just want a game with a small footprint, sci-fi theme and low price tag, just throw down a few more ducats for Race For The Galaxy.

---

I am still not a fan of deckbuilders that give you a random and ever-changing array of cards in the center of the table, much preferring the Dominion approach of multiple copies of a subset of the game's total card inventory being always available.

Having said that, Star Realms is far more indebted to Ascension, a game with which it has a Marvin Gaye/Robin Thicke level of mechanical similarity, with the critical distinction that in this case, the derivative work is a substantial improvement on the original. Ascension is not a total dumpster fire of a game -- it's an entertaining enough 10 minute iPad distraction -- but between the aforementioned ever-changing row of cards to buy and the removal of Dominion's caps on card purchases and actions, it eliminated a lot of the tactical edge from the granpappy of them all, not to mention intentionally hamstringing the designer's abilities to create cards that have interesting synergies or cards that do things besides giving you points, money or ass-kickin'ness.

Star Realms, for its part, replicates these faults, which does clip its wings as a design. But unlike in Ascension, where the occasional card synergy (based on its curiously underdeveloped four suits/colors/factions/whatever they're called) can be stumbled upon if the whims of the gods of the center row and the whims of your deck align just right, Star Realms, through the addition of the "ally" mechanic, gives you potentially useful synergies with almost any pair of cards of the same color, which is by itself enough to vault it from the ranks of "ugh" to the ranks of "not bad."

In the first rush of exploring the thing, I'm kind of getting into it, truth be told.

The question becomes: will it last? One does not want to draw too many inferences from price point, which is easily one of board gaming's least useful indicators of Quality, but one can't but help wondering if the game's Bic lighter MSRP indicates that the makers of Star Realms are aiming for burning out over fading away. Maybe; or maybe they're just taking a big swing at the mass market. It sure is accessible enough. But for a wizened strategy gamer it may end up being temporarily distracting shiny thing. We shall see.

RATING: 9
Star Realms is simply a ton of fun packed into a simple deck building game.  The learning curve is fairly shallow, most players will understand all the important concepts in 5-10 minutes.  

That doesn't mean the game itself is shallow.  Like any good deck building game there are a variety of possible play styles and even a variety of potential solo, co-op, 1v1, team-based, or free for all game setups. I appreciate games that perform well in a variety of formats like that. 

The game might need some work in the balance department.  While in theory all players have access to the same market pool, certain factions are inherently more powerful than others.  The mech faction for instance, is one of the only empires that can scrap (remove) non-useful cards from your deck and purify it into a more efficient fighting force.  For this reason it's almost always in the interest of players to take these cards whenever they see them.  

But the outcome of each game is largely determined by which cards appear in the market and which player is able to afford the best ones first.  I've had a few very fun "close games" but more often than not, there is a clear victor halfway through. 

Still, I will gladly play Star Realms any day of the week

An excellent head-to-head deck builder that's fast and fun. Very easy to burn a few hours playing or use it as a filler between longer games. This is one of my go-to games and is always in my luggage when I travel.

This game might be the best bang for your buck.  Very easy to learn and plays in about 15-20 minutes.  Once you have played a few times the games flows so smooth and decisions become easier.  With expansions keeping it fresh and a nice play time i high recommend this game.

Really blown away by this game. I was completely put off by the artwork and theme (I don't mind sci-fi but this looked boring) and decided to get it just on a whim after hearing so many good things. Well, it is fantastic! The art isn't nearly as bad as I thought and I think this is an unbelievably great game for its size and cost. Played about 5 times so far, we would have played more but we are trying to make headway on our Hardcore 10x10 so have to make time for other games. 

I think this will end up a 9 or 9.5 but I try to give it some time before I give something a 9 rating.

UPDATE: Have had this played heap of times and my boyfriend and his friend are always playing this - I have jokingly banned them from playing it lol

This is head and shoulders above most small box games - this, Valley of the Kings, and Schotten Totten are my top three. Awesome.

I've played this game countless times, both in person and on the great app. I don't think there is a more dynamic and balanced game than this (without expansions, which in my opinion throw off the balance way too much). This is a game whose depth I would compare to poker, I think it's that complex and difficult to master. Also like poker, it has enough unpredictability and luck to keep one scratching their head about each move.

At this point in time, I've played so much that I am tired of the game. I think the bareness of the theme keeps it from having the soul of a Yomi or Battlecon. With that said, I can see myself playing this for many years to come.

I vastly prefer the Dominion-style deck-builders (all your options for purchase available from the beginning) over the Ascension-style deck-builders (narrow selection of randomly drawn cards available), but this game pretty much perfects the Ascension style. The best benefit of this style is probably the painless and quick set-up. Sure, I prefer Dominion and its ilk, but is it worth the extra 15 minutes of set-up? In that same timeframe, you could have set up and played a whole game of Star Realms.

Deck building játék. Főleg a Steam és az iOS verzióval játszom, mert sokkal gyorsabb, de azért élvezetes a kártyás, asztali változat is, amit egyelőre 4 főig bővítettünk fel (de még egy Colony Wars-t tervezek beszerezni). Azt hiszem egy alap változat digitálisan ingyenesen elérhető minden platformra, szóval ki lehet próbálni online és ha bejön, biztosan bejön az asztali verzió is - még ha lassabb is, mivel a gép helyett az embernek kell számolgatnia, hogy mi mennyi.

I've now played like fifty games of this. I still enjoy it very much. It is very lightweight and easy to play. The different races offer for different tactics and you alspo have to decide do you go for ships that go to discard after use or do you go for bases that potentially stay longer on your table (they do not, because any sensible player knows to shoot them down immediately - they do buffer up damage though and who knows, sometimes they survive to your next turn). I like the artwork, it's colorful yet somehow realistic looking. The only think I don't like are the hp (Authority) cards, tokens would be much more logical for this purpose. A minor hiccup.

Get the expansion too.

It's fierce and fast.  Timing and luck of the draw plays a big part but so does making the right choices (what cards you buy, timing of scrapping cards, going for bases or ships, etc.)  It's a tight design with lots of cool artwork on the cards.  I think it's great! The expansions may add some variety/strategy.

I wish in an expansion they would give us a card to protect a base, you lose them fast

More depth than ascension but without the cool board.  The score keeping cards are a cute idea but they move around a lot (I guess that adds to the randomness of the game, haha)  But seriously get an app to keep score on your phone.

This game is really fun,BUT in the end of the day I don't think I get to do any meaningful decisions in the game.You usually buy the best card you can afford,then play it once it comes in your hand and this repeats untill either player is the winner.

While this can be played with more than two players, I have only played it with two. It's a fast, light, and fun combative two-player deck-building game.

RATING: 9
This is Ascension made better.  The game is quicker and there is PvP.  The PvP has very little spite to it which makes it a game that you really won't get pissed if you lose.  You can get hosed, but since the games last only 20-30 minutes a pop, just get your revenge next time.  The faction synergy is very fun.  Starting out doing 1 damage and winding up doing 50 is just plain fun.

RATING: 7.8
Good game. It's Dominion in space. Deck-building game! Mimics space battles and it can get pretty involved. Some games are quick though. You have 50 hit points for each player (2-player game, though you can purchase more decks and have more players). First person to lose their hit points is out. Last one standing wins. Multi-player version has a few different variants which adds to this game quite a bit. Lot of punch in this little package.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

My significant other and I love this game. It plays fast yet has deep strategy. Wins tend to be close with near-optimal play. It seems a bit like Ascension In Space but plays like its own game. Recommend substituting a set of d10 dice for of the provided cards to track how many points players have.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Okay, preliminary thoughts after four games. Normally, deck-building games don't do that much for me. They're okay, but don't hold my interest long, and I can usually find other lighter/filler games I'd rather play. That said, this game is a blast! Fun, fast-paced, exciting, a wild ride every game I've played. I value fun in games and this one has it in spades. Recommended to at least try. Very good game and a strong "8" rating.

[b]I own the following expansions for the game:[/b]

Star Realms: Colony Wars (full separate game deck)
Crisis: Events
Crisis: Bases & Battleships
Crisis: Fleets & Fortresses
Crisis: Heroes
United: Assault
United: Command
United: Missions
United: Heroes
Cosmic Gambit Set

This is an extremely poor game. 
Having played 500 odd games  now (56%) win rate (no idea if thats good or bad or indifferent). The game is 2% strategy, 8% sk.... no i can bring myself to write that, no lets say 6% 'correct card selection', + 2% 'scrap/shuffle manage ability' and 90% total luck. Most of the time you are simply just be along for the ride. The choices in this game a generally so obvious, you'd have to be a .............. (insert own word) not to realise them. If you are playing against an opponent who knows what they are doing you can generally tell 75% of the time by turn 10-12 who will win. Thats one thing in its favour, as you can then simply resign and start a new game. You should be able to get through 15-20 games an hour like that. Sure every now and again you'll be surprised by laughable bad draws, card combo's etc but really what the point. It offers superb illusions of choice etc which really aren't there and youare simply better of playing whist or snap.....

RATING: 8
This game has me hooked.  It's such a solid, no-nonsense design.  There really is beauty in simplicity.  It shines without the clanky mechanics (I'm knockin' on you, Dominion).  Just raw, fast, deck-building fun.

And like other deck-builders in this vein (Cryptozoic's stuff, etc.), it lends itself very well to solo play.

I finally played a 6-player version of this, and I hope to never play beyond 2-player again.  It shines as just a 2-player, and loses that shine beyond that.  So, great 2-player game! (only great as a 2-player game)

RATING: 6
This feels like a two-player re-theme of Dominion.  The game feels more tense and engaging with only two players.  The level of player interaction is also higher because instead of points each player has hit points (called authority) that the other is trying to cut down.

Is there strategy to this?  A little, but not much.  Two-player Race for the Galaxy is incredibly more strategic.  Nevertheless, for a $15 game that only takes 20 minutes, it's hard to give a lower rating.

This game has it all, and I want to continuously play it over and over again. Out of all my games this has to be the greatest hour/penny ratio, and it's only continuing. I would highly recommend the online version too, all the fun with half the work. Great for a quick game over lunch as well.

Android. Honestly, a more random Ascension. I enjoy that the app version has a campaign, but I find Ascension to be a more satisfying game, although neither game can hold a candle to Dominion. The choices seem to be even more "auto-pilot" than Ascension. Red cards are extremely overpowered. Taken solely as a mobile game, I appreciate the extremely quick playtime.

RATING: 7
Addicting, to say the least. Its simplicity is its biggest strength. Each faction does different things well and they're unique enough that they have their own personality. The key is to have the balance right - buying only one set of cards is not the best idea, nor is watering down and buying all of them without any aim. 

Unfortunately, I feel like decision-making is a little bit limited in this game. In most cases it's just selecting right cards from the trade row and when it comes to your turn, playing all of them. Thankfully it's satisfying enough that I'm not going to abandon Star Realms anytime soon.

Deckbuilding with TCG style battles sounds very intriguing, but the ability to solo with the Kickstarter Stretch goals sealed the deal for me. This should be a simple enough game to teach which can easily travel, but has interesting in game choices. Kickstarted.

Only played solo so far and it's a cool game. I think competitive play is probably better, but it's a good game solo. Will rank after I get some competitive games in.

RATING: 8
I can't say enough about this game.  It plays quick.  It's interactive.  It has card drafting.  It builds upon itself.  It has great art.  It is small and portable.  It allows for long-term strategy as well as short-term tactics.

Do you thin your deck using the Machine Cult and make a lean and efficient force?  Do you neutralize your opponent's forces before they can even be played with the Star Empire?  Do you maximize your authority with the Trade Federation as you amass your forces?  Or do you file off the safety and go on a rampage with the Blobs?

Has your opponent jumped out to a big lead?  Go heavy on outposts and look for Trade Federation cards to replenish your Authority.

Have a lot of powerful cards, but keep drawing Scouts and Vipers?  Invest in some Machine Cult ships and scrap those useless ships that keep getting in the way.

And always buy the Brain World.  Always.

Dominion lost its appeal long ago, but this game has rekindled my interest in deck builders.  Maybe it will fade over time, but as of now, I have played 27 F2F games, and 4000+ iOS games... and I still can't wait to play more!

I almost bought this game because of the unbelievable hype and low price. I'm glad I didn't.

The choices you make in this game seem so trivial and bulldozed by draw luck that I'm not even sure if this thing fits the definition of a game.
Read the review "Star Realms - The great imposter" for more information.

The most interesting thing about this game is the way most of the popular board game reviewers jumped on the hype bandwagon without a trace of criticism.

 It is solid, good, space-themed consistent space art, but I do think it is lacking a je ne sais quoi. The gameplay seems good, you may say that there is still the issue of a really great card may appear in the auction display for your opponent and none you really want appear for you, but I think the luck will balance out. And it does not have the issue that Ascension has where it is very hard to get the cards you want that can really form a deck with combos and synergy, nor does it have the problem of the beasts/monsters in Ascension that can really offer big lucky swings in points. I thought it was pretty decent, whereas I did not like Ascension. But the art does nothing for me.

pro: Very accessible. Plays fast. Liked the theme/art more than i thought i would.
con: Too little control over which cards/factions you can invest in. Feels too random and unstrategic.
 
Could have been much better with some of the design choices geared more towards mitigating randomness and luck of the draw.

update: downrated to a 3. Originally played it quite a bit on the ipad, but more as a guilty pleasure, could just as well have played a connect-3 game or something similar...  after a while it really feels like a braindead game, where you just buy the most efficient cards and hope they don't reveal even better ones for your opponent. really uninteresting.

Deck building in space. Fluent play. However, due to the fact that every player plays with cards from the 4 nations, there is no identification with a particular side in the conflict. This is a pity, because it makes it impossible to really live the theme of the game, to feel for example what it's like to be part of the Blob nation.

Pros: Surprising depth of strategy and tactics for what may seem like a filler two player deck builder. Highly replayable and many ways to pursue the singular victory condition.

Cons: Cards not cut evenly between multiple copies and really is best played as 2 player only. Expensive small expansion packs can bring variety but adds cost.

Most of my plays have been digital with the base game which opens this game up with a ranking and opponent matching system. Still a great two player card game in person.

I think this is a great game that's quick to play, and its small size makes it easy to carry on the go. The only thing that keeps me from rating Star Realms a 10 as is: its awkward scoring card system. It really slows the game down. There are great scoring apps out there for Android or Apple, and I recommend downloading and utilizing the app rather than scoring cards right from the beginning. Once I started using a scoring app, gameplay sped up significantly. Overall, hands-down one of my favorite games I own...and only for $10!

Deckbuilding per jugar 1x1, frenètic. Tipus Neuroshima en el sentit que has d'eliminar els 50 punts de vida (autoritat) del rival.
Hi ha un "Line-up" (o Trade List) de 5 cartes que es van renovant (tipus DC) + 1 mazo ("plates" del Dominion).
Hi ha 4 faccions, cadascuna especialitzada en algo. Lo ideal és anar comprant cartes de 1 o 2 faccions, ja que són realment sinèrgiques entre la mateixa facció: és a dir, hi ha cartes verdes que tenen un +2 atac si hi ha alguna altra carta verda jugada, lo que premia centrar-se en una facció.
També hi ha "bases": cartes que quan les jugues les poses davant teu i sempre et proporcionen algo (i algunes serveixen d'escut de la teva nau base).

This game is very, very similar to Ascension, but with less variety of cards. That's not necessarily bad; just different. It's a little more fragile in terms of unbalanced cards deciding the game, though.

I love the artwork and graphic design. It reminds me of those old Terran Trade Authority SF art books from the 70s and 80s. (Google it if you don't know them -- they were great!)

Want another quick-playing deck-builder? You could do worse than dropping ten bucks on this.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Eh, a little better than [i]Ascension[/i] I suppose in that there's direct player conflict and no real setup time. I guess it does have a [i]bit[/i] more decision making than [i]Ascension[/i] in that you have to choose your initial strategy (color) but, since the same types of cards feed off of each other, once you've picked it, your choices are largely obvious after the first round or two. Then it's just down to the timing of your hand and flop draws. And it's not like there's much tension, either, since you always play all of your cards. Just not much there, really.

At the end of the day, just filler, though it has found a place on my iPad as a time killer.

Update: I've begrudgingly had to upgrade my rating, which is pretty rare for me. Copious online play has revealed that there's more strategy to this game that I initially wanted to admit. Knowing which cards to buy and when to buy them was not as obvious as I first thought. There's definitely a trick to it, and although you always play your entire hand, sometimes the order in which you play your cards (i.e. deck thinners and outpost abilities) can matter. The draws can still hose you, so there's definitely an element of luck that can occasionally decide the close games, and I definitely think the cost of some of the cards, such as Recycling Station, are off. Still, it's head & shoulders above [i]Ascension[/i] which did NOT reveal anything more interesting with online play.

What I Liked:
* Simple and fast game
* Different factions suit different types of gameplay.

What I Didn't Like:
* A fair bit of luck which can be taken advantage of the more you know and play the game.
* Can easily lead to one sided games which isn't fun at all.

Overall:
Decent game that is growing on me despite the oneside play that can occur. There are better 2 player games out there.

RATING: 7.8
Grows a bit stale after you've seen all the cards 100 times, and the deck isn't perfectly balanced by any means. However, it is quite fun, quick, and deep enough to scratch the deckbuilder itch when we are traveling and can't bring Dominion!

Attack! Attack! Attack! If you want consistent player interaction, this one's for you. You know that's the case when the scoring isn't about gaining victory point, but rather taking them away from your opponents until they're eliminated at 0. It's a great two-player, game and in many respects a different game at 3 and 4. Two-player games can go fast and you tend to choose a strategy or two. Four player games can go on for awhile with ups and downs and the chance to rebuild as others attack the leader. Another great one to play at bar. The Base Game is so affordable, the expansions seem expensive. Also pretty great iPad app version of this game.

I'm really impressed by this game. Appears very well balanced, and there's a significant degree of strategy in the purchasing decisions. Seems to be holding up to repeated plays (mostly on the digital version; only logging physical plays).  There is a slightly annoying amount of in-turn book-keeping, which the digital version handles exceptionally well.

Looking forwards to "expansion" type cards, to mix in to the deck!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Maybe it's because this is my first deck builder but I love this game. The fact that this game is very easy to learn and 1v1 games can take around 20 minutes or even less makes this game quick and enjoyable IMO. Not to mention that it includes rules to play several different game types that support up to 6 players (You need at least 2 boxes of the base game to play with more than 2 people). The only downsides are that this game is lacking in depth and also they give you cards with numbers to keep track of your authority (which is basically your life). I just use a pen and paper. I highly recommend this game if you like deck builders, sci-fi, or quick learning group games.

Multiplayer game types:

Free For All - 3+ players - Pretty obvious how this works.

Hunter - 3+ players - You can only attack players authority to the left of you. You can also attack player bases to the left OR right of you. 

Hydra - Teams of 2v2 or 3v3 with a combined authority. A team all goes at the same time and can combine their trade pool to buy things and combine their combat pools to attack bases or authority. Outposts protect the entire team from damage and must be destroyed first.

Emperor - 3v3 team game where everyone has their individual authorities. Each team has an emperor in the middle and two admirals (one on either side of him). The emperor can attack any enemy while the admirals can only attack the enemy admiral across from them. If an admiral defeats the enemy admiral across from him he may now target the emperor. When an emperor is defeated their team loses the game.

Raid - 3-6 players (1 boss and 2-5 raiders). 1 player is the boss and the rest are raiders. Basically the boss has higher authority and a larger hand size to make up for the lopsided teams. Raiders can discuss strategies but have separate authorities and do not share their trade or combat pools.

Coop Challenges - 1-6 players - There are currently only 2 challenges which are found in the Gambit Set. Up to 6 players can work to defeat either the Nemesis Beast Or Pirates of The Dark Star. Both of these challenges look hard.

Great little deck-builder.  My 7-year old and I play it regularly.  But we use Ascension gems for scoring instead of those cards.  Much easier to manage.  The scores can fluctuate wildly sometimes, especially with the blue faction.  Lots of fun.  Quick.  Streamlined.

After playing the Star Realms app a lot lately, I feel the need to update my rating. There are quite a lot of things to learn if you want to up your chances of winning: Which are the "key cards" that define your overall strategy? When do I switch from merely building my deck into the full blown attack mode? Which cards do I have to deny my opponent? All this questions popped up with a better understanding and  knowledge of the (base) deck and kept me coming back over and over again. Addicting stuff. 

Currently I think that the most important part of the game is the buying phase, here it is where you make your decision. Unfortunately, the playing of cards from hand doesn't offer that many opportunities for clever play. Sure, sometimes you have to decide if you want to scrap a card for the money or not, but most of the times you just have live what you have been dealt which directly corresponds to your buys. But who knows, maybe I'll discover more depth here with more plays. Until then, Star Realms is solid 7 for me.

After playing the app and some face to face games, I feel confident enough to rate Star Realms. All in all the Star Realms is a fun, easy and quick playing deck builder. I've enjoyed the games I've played so far and I guess I'll surely play it some more, but with Puzzle Strike and Blue Moon I've got two games in my collection that I would always prefer to play instead of Star Realms when I'm in the mood for a more confrontational two player card game. It's just not as deep as the two games I mentioned earlier. But for the price, this one is a steal.

Mechanically sound but linear Ascension-like deckbuilder. Plays quickly, but rather 'point candy'; it seems to be best to dabble in all factions for their best cards over focusing on one or two for synergy, meaning it's usually a matter of getting the better cards before your opponent does.

The only expansion I have is Gambit, which adds some interesting cards to spice it up as well as a fantastic solo and co-op mode. 

If you enjoy the space theme and deck builders this game is a must. If you're a fan of dominion, pick this game up for the price it's a steal. 

Cannot recommend this game enough. Want to give it a 10 but it's very very close.

A lighter deck builder most notable for its CCG-like direct conflict. Not quite as enthusiastic about this one as some other people here, but it's fun. A few innovative ideas, like the ally powers to encourage combos and the damage to opposing players. It's also a pretty terrific value at $15. A little swingy and dependent on luck of the draw.

This is basically the same game as Ascension with a different theme.  In fact, the game play is to similar that I think of this as an expansion to Ascension.

With that said, Star Realms has become my favorite version of Ascension.  It's a very well balanced set of cards.  They have great interaction which leads to an interestingly dynamic game.  There is a tremendous amount of skill in the game, which is what keeps it interesting for so many plays.  At the same time, there is a huge amount of luck in regards to whether cards of the same faction are drawn in pairs or not.  It's the balance between these two aspects that keep the game interesting.  Even when you have a very good position, there is usually  an outside chance that an amazing combo of cards can come up to reset things back to parity.

Whether you have or haven't played Ascension, I highly recommend trying Star Realms.

Took a good number of plays to wrap my head around it as I never played a "deck-builder" before... Really enjoyed the genius/mechanics once I got it down.  
Not really a fan of "space-ship" theme.  Would have probably liked "Hero Realms" better had it been released first.

*Downloaded the ioS app which helped significantly learn the game, plus it is much faster gameplay, easier scoring process, and a great AI to play against.

The best deckbuilding game I've ever played, for 1v1. In terms of competitive play, I feel it has some slight issues in balance, but nothing that can't be solved easily, especially with WWG announcing a competitive format soon.

Own the base set and two of the Crisis expansions as of this writing. Intend to own the Colony Wars set and the rest of the expansions, try out 3-4 player games.

I had to decide between this and Hero realms, and even though I like fantasy theme more and graphics on the star realms cards didn't look so nice on the images, I picked this one up as soon as I found it in local board game store, published in polish. In real the graphics on the cards look awesome (though cards could be of better quality) and really add to the climate of space confrontation. The game sometimes become too random, leaving you not many choices to have, but in overall I have great fun each time I play it. 
Can't wait till Hero realms are published in polish too.

Between Ascension, Cthulhu Realms and this, this is the one that hits the table most. So easy to teach, quick and smooth to play, quick satisfaction. Factions and different abilities are clear and balanced. Games can be long-ish strategic battles, or can end quickly with a sudden massive Combat combo based on luck of the draw. So much fun. For me, it's the perfect portable two-player card game for when you don't have a lot of time.

RATING: 7.2
I've had to drop this from an 8.  I'm not sure that I can recommend it anymore.  It's a good game, but it comes off as being pretty vanilla and the expansions don't really add any new mechanics, just more cards (I'll even say that events, heroes, and gambits don't do anything significant to change that statement).  I think Ascension is the gold standard for deckbuilders, particularly if you're familiar with the base and each subsequent standalone expansion.  Each one of those adds new and interesting mechanics.  Not all of them are winners for me (portals, Dreamscape), but it's always exciting to see what they release next.  At this point, I'd recommend Ascension all day long over Star Realms.

Every game is a bit different and you have to be adaptive in forming a strategy.  First deck-builder I've played outside of Dominion, so this may be common for the genre.

RATING: 7
Ascension but fun.   The multi-player 1 vs All variant seems to work well.   The designers have said that you are never out of the game (which is the same as saying that it can be very swingy), but that doesn't bother me.   The art is a little loud for my tastes, but the colors/icons are functional and easy to see at a glance.   Will probably need significant expansion to keep the "middle row" fresh and interesting, but this is a good game in the genre, and priced right.

Probably the only deck-builder I'll ever need going forward. I enjoyed Dominion for a long time, but sold my whole set years ago. I've kept Thunderstone for a long time, but it never sees daylight, so I'll be heaving it off too. I fear I just don't find the deck-building system fun - it's an exhausting repetition, especially the early game.

At least Star Realms is kept in a smaller box, and is good for me to whip out on the move. I've heard that Hero Realms with the character packs adds a lot to the game, but I'm not looking for any more from it - it's everything I really need it to be as it is.

This one seems to have taken the game world by storm.  It's kind of an evolution deckbuilders have been going through, making the transition from strict economic engine euro to a more freeform, combo-y, interactive style reminiscent of a CCG.  Star Realms is the latest step in this progression, and it's quite good fun.  
Plays fast and has lots of choices about which cards to put into your deck, when to trash them out of it, how many factions to dabble with, and so on.  The 5-cards display is kind of limiting, and you can find yourself staring at a bunch of expensive cards you can't afford, with no option but to buy explorers or pass.  Of course, it can be very random.  If you win the race to buy a particularly strong card, you'll be well ahead early.  You can continue to buy suboptimal things, only to flip great stuff for your opponent once you're out of funds.  You can commit to a color, only to have it completely dry up in the display.  There are things that will veto cards out of that display, but not enough, imo, and limited to the blob faction.  Trashing things from your deck is similarly limited to the machine cult.  Asymmetries like that bother me a little, but as long as both players know what they're doing, it's not usually a problem.  Because of this, games can be one-sided blowouts, or they can be tense matches that come down to who draws their good cards on the last couple turns.

Simple deck building game a la Dominion (read: Ascension) where you are buying powerful space ships and bases in 4 different factions (colors)  and playing them in front of you, possibly making combos with the cards of the same faction, to ultimately destroy you opponent.
It's fast, fun, a bit random and cheap, and it requires additional deck to play with more than 2 players which I have yet to try.

Es un gran juego de construcción de mazo. No sé si mejor que mi querido Dominion. Es tan adictivo como este último, pero mucho más compacto, dinámico y confrontativo. 

Me gusta mucho que se trate de destruir al oponente. También es interesante que no se arrastren cartas de PV, como en el Dominion, lo que lo hace mucho más fluido. Aunque esa característica del Dominion tendía a controlar a quién intentaba despegarse demasiado pronto. Lo cual no dejaba de ser interesante.

Espero que Devir saque algunas expansiones pronto, para darle variedad al juego, si llegara a hacerme falta, y para poder probar el modo solitario.

Head-to-head Ascension describes this one pretty accurately. Reduce your opponent to zero health (authority) to win. I pretty much feel like your best plays are to buy bases always... they provide continual abilities (at least until destroyed) and some can protect you from taking some damage. Maybe I haven't played it enough but that's my opinion. I think I'm in the minority, but I definitely like Ascension more in many respects (artwork, card effects, etc). Ascension also has an advantage since it has so many expansion released at this point.

I'm not one for playing physical sets of deckbuilding games. I was happy to hear of the digital version, but it's just not as slick as the Ascension implementation. It was nice knowing you Star Realms.

iOS version (free*)

Big fan of mini-deck builders (I'm looking at you "Friday"), and Star Realms is a case study in what makes gaming fun to begin with. That's a pretty lofty claim, but, SR is also an excellent example of low investment, high return gaming. Not hard to learn, and very satisfying. 

Physical version:

-Card stock not great, might need to get sleeves... 

-Would be so much better if authority were tracked by any other mechanism than what they chose (maybe a card sized dial thingy?)

-Packaging not going to survive much abuse.

I'd like this more if it were a filler games were over in half the time.  While it does play fairly fast, there's a too much luck of the draw and late in the game, the math can slow down the turns.  It seems like you either get a good faction draw and run over the other player, or you end up with a random assortment and the game starts to drag on.

Great filler deck building game. Only really good with two players or teams, since the way that attacks work will not translate well to a free for all. I'm fine with that, its great at two. It feels a bit like a very interactive Ascension. All the typical deck building issues apply. Thinning starting cards, synergy and comboing as well as tempo and ramping all seems fairly well integrated. There is luck of the draw but it still feels largely like you have some control on the games outcome. The single player senerios are very draw dependent though, and will showcase how much luck of the draw can play in this game.

RATING: 5
A nice introductory deck builder, but it doesn't stack up to its competition. I really like the ideas in place, especially the chaining of powers between faction cards, but this same mechanism makes it incredibly difficult to pivot strategies and play adaptively. The early game decisions pigeonhole players for the rest of the game, leaving them to rely solely on the market to pan out for them. Granted the game is short, so this lack of flexibility can be forgiven. Keeping track of your authority is dreadfully tedious, though.

Star Realms is a great direct combat deckbuilder, but my one complaint is that 50 health doesn't offer enough time to really develop an engine.  Oftentimes the winner is the one who happens to have enough money on their turn to buy generally good cards, regardless of synnergy with previous purchases.

RATING: 6.5
Pros: Cheap, quick, easy to teach the basics to a new player, portable. Cons: Way too luck based for my taste, very swingy game, feels like it ends to quickly, strategies quickly become formulaic and strips away real decisions. The more I play it, the more flaws I see and the less I like it. My rating would be lower, but raising it because my son likes the big "take that" numbers in spite of the high amount of luck. If you are a fan of deckbuilders, want an entertaining, quick game for a good price, or are a fan of big numbers & big combos, then I'd say it's a game you should pick up. GeekBay Auction

Very simple, light deckbuilder that can surprisingly have some interesting ideas going into keeping yourself open to avoid being screwed by the randomized trade row.

 This is my favourite deck building game so far. 

 I find It's easy to pickup and teach to new players. Yet It has a surprising amount of depth to it. The artwork is amazing. Plus the price point is incredible.

 The minor quibble I have towards this game is that the authority cards can be a little fiddly. That being said, it's easy enough just to use a pen and paper. 

Great game, great price. Highly recommend this game for anyone who wants a quick little deck builder. 9/10

My favorite deckbuilder, and overall great game. I own a few other deckbuilding games (Nightfall, Rune Age, and I've played Dominion and Ascension of course) but this is  by far the most streamlined, smoothest deckbuilder I have ever played. Nothing stands in the way of the heart of this genre: building great combo's. Plus, there is real player interaction a lot of different strategies to follow and turns are lightning fast. 

One of the best. Will be playing this for a long time to come.

Tried several times to learn this on the Android app as I like the space theme and it's always recommended as both a brilliant game and app, but I found it boring and difficult to learn (or maybe it's just that I am not interested in deckbuilding). Either way, it was serving no purpose. A physical copy is not an option as my gaming partner does not like aggressive games or space themed games.

Fast and streamlined deckbuilder with lots of attacking and really fast setup. One of the best "fun per time", "fun per volume", and "fun per dollar" games! Addictive.

I enjoy playing it so much and have found myself playing it so much - on my phone, on my tablet and the real version (in that order) - that I simply have to award it the maximum rating.

Dominated by randomness, and definitely best as an app.  I still play the app all the time, but the card game isn't good enough to justify the extra effort to do math and resolve effects.
[b]previous comment:[/b]

(played mostly on the phone or tablet apps, although I own the physical version too)

Star Realms is a game that borrows a lot from earlier deck builders, and I am a little bit surprised at its popularity.  It suffers from the same problem as the Cryptozoic deck builders, whose "path" system is very similar - too much randomness.  Not only can you get screwed in the randomness by not drawing the right card combinations to trigger faction-specific effects, but you can get screwed by the randomness by choosing to buy a crappy card, because it's your only option, only to have the card you actually wanted replace it, and get bought by your opponent.  In fact, I'd argue that Star Realms is MORE random than the Cryptozoic deck builder.

I originally rated it slightly higher than my favorite Cryptozoic game, Lord of the Rings DBG, for one reason:  The combat system.  This direct conflict is a nice twist compared to most minimally interactive deck builders, and definitely adds to the game.  Granted, it's extremely swingy, tends to snowball, and the card-based influence counters are a pain to use, but it's still fun to pull off a 30-point combo and beat the crud out of your opponent.

After further play, I realized that the only reason I rated Star Realms higher than LOTR or DC was that I was playing on the app, which was making the game super-fast and hiding the negative impact of the extra susceptibility to randomness.

For $15, this game is a decent value, but it certainly wasn't worth the hype levels where people were paying twice MSRP to buy it when stores started running out of stock.  The APP VERSION of this game should also completely fire any of the plethora of Cryptozoic deck builders for most people, since it does what they do in a quicker game with the extra fun of combat.  On the table, it's a crap shoot - the combat is more fun but the game is more dominated by randomness.

Streamlined and fast paced two player deckbuilder which plays in a similar fashion to ascension. I enjoyed how each faction in the game feels very different.

There are limited ways to strip the base cards out of your deck but they are not necessarily a huge clog like the initial cards can be in other deck builders.

It can drag a little if one player gathers a lot of the healing cards.

Probably my favorite filler game that I own. I'm almost always willing to play. Beautiful cards and fascinating factions.

A great gateway game for the genre.

Tulajdonképpen egy sci-fi ascension. Annyiban más, hogy itt a haderőt egymás gyakására használjuk a szörnyek helyett. Amúgy gyors, pörgős, és azért vannak benne döntések, de ugyanúgy, mint az ascensionnél sokat számít, hogy mit kaparsz ki a másiknak, illetve az is, hogy az elején ha elindítasz valami specializálódást, akkor ahhoz mennyire jönnek ki később a lapok.
Alapjában véve kétfős játék, de kíváncsi vagyok, milyen lehet több fővel. Illetve nagy piros pont jár a scenariókért, amikkel megpróbálják változatossá tenni a játékot. Jó lenne ilyesmi az ascensionhöz is.

The build/shrink-your-deck-as-you-play mechanic (that ive learned is common these days) makes this feel like next gen to an old mtg player. Less of a "good-vs-bad draws" game and more of a real strategy game. Very nice and gets its grade in the space of short/easy games.

RATING: 5
I don't get the hype. Must be the price point and the quick play, because the game itself is not that great. Interesting combos but for most part too random to feel rewarding. Prefer Ascension over this, especially on iOS.

Edit: Rating downgraded after winning a game by simply purchasing the most expensive card I could get my hands on each turn. Mindless play = no fun

RATING: 6
Star Realms is one of the myriad Dominion look-alikes. It uses a shared center row (see Ascension) instead of a fixed card pool and focuses on immediate confrontation rather than Dominion's more sedate (and sedating) combo-building, giving it a rather different feel in play. The available factions feature distinctly different abilities and the game actually encourages faction specialization which is nice.

Card effects are all fairly simple and a game is over quickly so the luck of the shared center row isn't overbearing. Despite the conflict-driven gameplay the game actually feels more like a "comfort zone" game if that makes any sense. It flows quite pleasantly, you can start playing right away and without giving it too much of a thought but I'm wondering whether it has enough substance to sustain repeated plays over a longer period of time. Only time will tell, I suppose.

Fantastic little card game that you can carry in your purse! Casual enough for a beer and pretzels game. yet, engaging. The only thing I didnt like was how fiddly the point cards were. They really should of come up with some other way to keep score. Maybe a score track card, or a die...something. This is easily fixed though, so no big deal. I have a feeling we will still pull out Dominion when we want a light deckbuilding experience, but this will find a home in my purse when we are traveling or hanging out at a bar.

A good deckbuilding game that is simple to play. So basic though, that I think our group has outgrown it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Counter-play seems to exist between most factions: the Blob want big hands, so they hate the Star Empire; the Star Empire struggles to put out a large enough force to be able to knock down the Trade Federation's outposts and authority as fast as they are put up; and the Trade Federation cannot handle the Blob's massive brute force. The Machine Cult however is an utterly game deciding faction due to the pure strength of their scrapping which doesn't even hold an opportunity cost. If one player is unlucky enough to never have a Machine Cult card in the Trade Row on their turn, they have practically no chance of winning.
The lack of constraints in playing cards makes the deck building trivially easy much like the other well known deck builder from this designer. The Allied Abilities (that trigger with other cards of similar factions) are the biggest consideration that goes into buying cards-- though often a player does not want to buy cards simply because a better card might appear for their opponent!
The power ramp is huge, fast, and erratic. It is a reasonably fun ride and the game ends gracefully the moment a player begins to pull ahead rather than dragging on when the winner is certain.

The game is quick to learn. the computer version is also quick and fun. On the minus side, there are some very strong and cheap cards, such as the recycling station, freighter, which can be brought very early. So it can be frustrating when you buy an ok card but then the powerful card showed up and your opponent can buy it immediately.

Great game.  My 10 year old daughter loves it.  Play solo on mobile though.  Do not see the cards keeping up with more plays due to the black background showing wear easily.  It took a couple of rounds for the wife to warm up to the game. By the end of the game she like it.  

Permanent game in my collection!  :thumbsup:

My experience with this game is from playing the base App.

This 2p card game really takes a lot of the streamlining that other deck builders like ascension did and enhanced it. The faction synergy is awesome and the balance of the base game is one of the best ever. I've played 998 games of this on the app as of this recording

The game only takes 10-15 mins and there is so much to explore. Each game has strategic and tactical elements to it

Star Realms is (in my opinion) a more interesting version of Ascension. Mechanics for adding to your deck are streamlined and the addition of regular abilities to thin out your deck are much appreciated as well. Where I have issues with this game is the overall snowballing of the winner that I have experienced; a player who is able to purchase a powerful card and then get lucky enough to be able to use it on the following turn just seems to get so much of an advantage (particularly so early on in the game) that it's hard to come back from. I don't think this is necessarily a problem, as that's the nature of a game featuring large amounts of randomness, however it doesn't often feel good to be effectively helpless in a game.

What's to say about Star Realms that hasn't already been said.

Honestly, this is one of the best deck builders out there. It has a perfect amount of player interaction. There's just so much depth in a game of 108 cards. There's early, mid and late game strategies within a playing time of about 20 minutes. Rules are straight forward to pick up.

There is randomness and luck in the draws, but it requires a high level of planning and tactics to succeed. All for $15. And you can combine sets to play team battles and additional game modes!

Basically a space-retheme of Ascension. But I do like the direct competition of blowing each other up, and I like the greater interplay of factions.

I used to suck big-time at this game and lose almost all matches, until I read some strategy guides. This one is excellent: https://megahaulin.wordpress.com/2015/08/27/the-pace-of-the-game-part-1-a-game-of-four-and-a-half-decks/. Basically hands 1-2 are for buying cards that give money and scrap ability, hands 3-4 for solidifying the chosen strategy (deck colour), and hands after that on locking into this strategy and buying powerful cards. Scrapping (red's ability) is extremely strong so all my decks contain some red cards, but which colour I play depends on which cards I get from the market in the first 1-3 hands.

RATING: 6
Quick play deck building lite war game - most like Ascension in it's mechanics but with a good direct conflict system. Because it uses the "centre row of available cards" mechanic the luck of the draw factor is very high. Becomes a bit add-up-ee once you get some ally ships in play and need to count up all those ally activated factors - maybe the app is a better option in that respect.

We have found the strategy a bit limited - go for the big money early and then big combat factors - planets seem a bit underpowered - seems that a defensive strategy is not really viable. 

Card art is good and the card stock is solid, rules are well written and set out and the cards are easy to understand. A small grip is the life point counter system - cards in various denominations that you flip as your life points go up and down - a bit cumbersome - we use beads. Ok.

RATING: 6
Portable, which I appreciate, but it lacks the production polish that Ascension has. It's hard not to compare this with Ascension and there two key things to keep in mind when comparing the two. In Ascension, you race to defeat monsters that pop up, or you purchase cards with a good amount of victory points, namely Constructs. You and your opponent deplete a pool of points, then it is all tallied at the end. In Star Realms, it's all about attack and defend. You have your cards that allow you purchase beefier ships, than you have you bases to defend and give bonuses, along with your fleet of attack ships. It's far more aggressive and feels more like Mtg, actually. If you are into confrontation, Star Realms is it. Love the artwork.

Pretty decent deck builder.  I like it better than Ascension, I think, simply because of the direct confrontation.  It's pretty darned similar to Ascension, however, which is to be expected as it's in the same lineage.  Definitely worth the $15 to get it.  Recommended.

Good light deck building game with much interaction (shooting at each other). However there is one major drawback - a snowball effect! This means that close to the game end it depends on final card draws who wins (much random). So you can expect a sudden game end just because of luck card draws...

Smooth-playing deck builder with little scope for interesting maneuvering. The tiny selection of cards on offer + the need to specialize in terms of factions = a very restricted and formulaic decision space.

The faction system doesn't work well because of the dynamics of the two-player draft. If you focus exclusively on your favored one or two factions, then you're letting your opponent do the exact same thing, and the game will simply come down to whose factions appear in the draft queue. If you play more of a mixed value/denial strategy, then neither player will have reliable combos, and the game will come down to whose deck randomly clumps same-faction cards together. Either way, the overall feeling is that my choices don't really matter.

I've been dropping the rating lately as my affinity for deck builders is beginning to decline. However, the game is still addictive in short bursts. The Ipad app is wonderful. My complaints about the clunky scoring when playing the game face-to-face still remain, but I play 98% of my games on the Ipad, so I shouldn't ding the game too much for something that rarely affects me. A wonderful deck builder with a great theme and some awesome expansions.

I seriously enjoy Star Realms. The speed at which the game ramps up is ludicrous. Four to five turns into the game, there will be so many cards played with so many different power and abilities that it is mind boggling. The artwork and thematics of the game allow for a decent amount of story telling to occur during play. My only gripe is that there isn't a lot to keep me coming back for more plays but for 15 dollars, it is very hard to beat this. Buy Star Realms

Competent deckbuilder with scifi art. Plays very similarly to Ascension, but instead of attacking the monsters on the table you attack other players. 

After you picked which way your deck will go the decisions on how to build it are very limited. You get the most expensive card from your faction you can afford.

Has several play modes and can be expanded to add more players.

Most of the illustrations show a ship with some nebula/planet behind it, and they end up looking too similar to each other. 

Kudos for having a free app with asynchronous online play. I just wish the font was bigger!

Wow. Compact, intuitive, and strategic. I started playing this game and didn't even check the clock again until 1am. The different factions feel relatively balanced, but Machine Cult and the necessity of deck-thinning mean you're going to get a bit of red in every good deck. Game length and complexity feel perfect. Drafting options feel streamlined and the gameplay is unique enough to warrant extended sessions. 

Explorers don't feel useful to buy very often, if ever. There is some minimal degree of homogeneity to how games play out, at least once you've settled into an archetype but this is often in the closing few turns anyways.

[b]On Colony Wars:[/b]
Like a tuned-up version of Star Realms, overall power level seems higher but there's also a more uniform level of balance. Don't know that this'll be replacing Star Realms but likely I'll alternate in order to keep the cards fresh.

RATING: 7
It's a solid deck builder, where skill will override luck, most of the time.  However, with the deck being randomized it begins to break down somewhat in that certain ships will only ever be available to one player.  My other concern with the game was that the scale/theme of the game was really lacking.  Federation fighting Federation?  How long of a time frame is one turn?  These things aren't terribly important, but add flare and fun.

The game is a very fun 2-player deck-builder, but lacks any flare to push it higher.

Very pleasant deck-building game with gorgeous artwork, but luck of the draw can be huge. This applies equally to what cards are available to purchase and the players' own draws. Ally abilities are very good, and being lucky to have two cards of the same faction in your hand makes a lot of difference. At least the cards are pretty well balanced in relation to cost and power, but getting certain cards in the beginning of the game may be devastating. It still works as a very light two-player filler. Also, I have to admit that its electronic version, featuring various campaigns against the A.I., is somewhat addictive and certainly pushed my rating up.

This is about the best game that can be designed at its weight and length, and has that economy to recommend it. I can't think of anything I can play in less than an hour that's as good, and this often takes no more than twenty minutes. Still, it does tend to reward simple strategies (Buy every Blob!) just about as much as more sophisticated strategies, making it feel unrewarding to invest time using for anything beyond a palette cleanser in a longer session.

Wow, just wow. I love Ascension but they really made it better and more streamlined with this. It plays fast as hell, the rules are easy to teach, and it's a lot less fiddly Han Ascension (fewer factions, cards that stay past the discard phase are horizontal instead of vertical, the card coloring stands out better so you can tell factions easier, the pull pile is smaller, combat is easier and actually direct, and it feels less like solitaire. Plus the multiplayer options are fantastic. 

Like a 20 minute game of magic, but easier and faster and set in space for $10. Amazing and they haven't crapped it down with too many expansions, rather adapting the system to other genres with tweaked rules.

RATING: 8
After 75+ games...

For the price, this is a good game.

It may appear light at first, but there are myriad combos and multiple paths to victory.

Unfortunately, it being a card/deck building game, there is still a sizable luck factor.  Will you have the resources to buy those big cards, or will the big cards be available when you have the resources?  Will the combos come out together, or in different hands?

Team play looks promising, but requires the purchase of an extra game per two players.

If you like light-medium and fast playing deck building games, it would be a good addition to your collection, as a game can be completed in 20-30 minutes, and it has a relatively small foot print.

If you despise randomness, there may be just a bit too much here you.

But you may try before you buy, as the game is available as a free download for most platforms!  So you can learn how to play versus the (easy) computer AI.

It's comparable to Ascension, but at first blush this seems to be a better game. It's a deck builder with a common pool of randomly replaced cards, like Ascension. The random card appearance seems less annoying to me here, probably because it's only for 2 players... There are four different factions of cards, and specializing in a faction is highly rewarded, as playing more than one card of a faction results in increased payoff. I don't know how balanced it is, but yellow and red factions seem extremely powerful.

Easy to pick up, fast moving, and over before you know it. Overall, I think this is pretty solid.

Man am I hooked on this game..

Quick, confrontational, two-player, deck-building card game.

It's deckbuilding in it's truest form, feels a bit like programing. You wanna get a lean, deadly program loop to crush your opponent.

It's incredible addictive, but unfortunately doesn't really facilitate table talk.

Programers & people with mild autism love this game.
Around your 6th play you might instead of cards only see code.. ;)

Atm i feel that if someone gets the freighter or the recycling station in the first 2 rounds & both players are of equal strength it's almost a sure win.. :(
In other words, it seems a bit unbalanced. I guess you could counter that by saying that those cards are reshuffled if they turn up in one of the first 2 rounds.

Good God but the box is some kind of joke—it actually tore as I opened it, and this was going in forewarned of its flimsiness!  I suppose the designers, as [gameid=463] fiends, consider deck packaging to be the equivalent of sausage casings, only there to keep the meaty bits in one place until wolfed down.  I recommend immediate replacement with, say, a translucent deck box.

First couple plays:  Just like the last breath torn from your lungs during a decompression event, this is short and far sweeter than you'd think.  I am especially impressed with what must have been a great deal of editing on the part of the designers in order to arrive at such simplicity when it would have been so easy—and surely seductive—to just keep piling on more and more...

And it turns out I'm a sucker for the badass sci-fi art—any one of those cards would look just plain [i]awesome[/i] airbrushed onto a panel van.

PS.  The Authority Cards (used to track "hit points" for game end) work just fine—they're not nearly as fiddly or inconvenient as others might have you believe.  I love the fact that they allow for the entire game to fit in a standard hobby deck box with no need for extra bits like glass beads, dice, or even paper & pencil.

I dig the self-contained portability of the thing—in the end it's just a deck of cards.  And that's perfect.

Have been playing this a bit on my Moto X against the AI and I really enjoy it as a nice filler.

[b]Update:[/b] Wound up buying a full copy because as a Dominion-like filler, I can get that fix in quickly at work and such. I don't expect to get this out that often at home since the wife doesn't enjoy card games, but for $15 and a small footprint, I'm OK with that.

My rating of this game is based on the free version of the iOS app. It is okay, but I felt the optimal path was too scripted based on the cards available and there wasn't a lot of in depth decision making.

It took me a while before I realized I was not a deck-builder fan. Marvel Legendary sold me on the concept but in hindsight there was a lot of newness and shiny theme going on. The level of self expression in a deck-builder is high and I can see the appeal in that. Star Realms accomplishes all the things I love in a deck builder (combos, planning, and deck customization) with a minimal amount of the things I dislike (setup, constant shuffling, predictability). The expansions did nothing for me.  Side note: The art was a surprisingly miss for me. While I love starships and space imagery, the work here, while fundamentally good, lacks a lot of style and soul. It's almost too colorful and quickly approaches self-published sci-fi novel on Amazon. I know it's tough to design 4 unique factions that inform their playstyle, but the art really holds this game back from a 9.

A great game to introduce people to deck building because it is so simple and fun! It has huge replay ability too. If you add the expansions they integrate seamlessly. The theme is consistent and works well. There are number multi player games too if you have more than one starter set or the 'Colony Wars' set. If you can put together a combo you can do severe damage to your opponent/s. Even they will appreciate it as win the game with it.

Update December 2016: Picked up a physical copy. I think I might prefer the app, actually, since it does all of the fiddly scoring and upkeep for you. I like this game fine, but after what must be well over a thousand plays on the app, I've come to realize that you don't have a ton of agency. There's room for a tiny bit of strategy, but ultimately the game is kind of on rails, and your strategic options are limited by the luck of the draw. But when a game takes 10 minutes, this becomes less of an issue.

Obsessed with the app version. Such a tidy, fun little game.

A single game is fun. A dozen games show your skill.

I love the theme and the great artwork. It's a lot of fun playing this game. You win some, lose some. But after a while you get the feeling, that winning depends more on luck than on skill. What makes this game seam so totally unbalanced is, that the choice for each player is so completely different.
In Dominion everybody has the same choice and the skill is finding the best mechanic to win. While changing the trade row is more interesting, it makes the game completely random. Machi Koro has a better aproach, since there are less different cards available more often and more cards in "trade row", which makes them stay longer.
Despite all that, skill is very important. You can't just look at it one game at a time. A single game is fun. A dozen games show your skill.

Runaway hit with my older son (9) and me (old);). We love our space battles before bed. Lot of fast fun in a small package. Love how simple it is, but creates a lot of excitement as you race to come out on top.

It's also easy to handicap a bit for kids by swapping out a scout or two for explorers.

Currently my favorite 2 player game.  I understand that Star Realms is highly derivative of Ascension, but I am not an Ascension fan.  I love the science fiction theme of Star Realms and the art on the cards.  This game just works very well:  a good deck-builder that tasks players with depleting their opponent's 50 "authority" points..  The base game is very re-playable and fun and a TREMENDOUS gaming value @ $14.00, fits in a small box, very portable.  An excellent game.  If you like deck builders or are looking for a great 2 player game, give Star Realms a try.  I will also mention that it is easy to teach and learn.  You can enjoy Star Realms with non-gamers.

** Update:  I am enjoying Star Realms very much, but sometimes I feel like there is too much randomness.  So it is random--like in all card games--which sequence your cards are drawn into your hand from your draw pile, which is fine.  There are games that are won or lost because my cards were drawn in a fortuitous sequence (or not!) That randomness is compounded with the randomness of the trade offering.  It often seems like I don't have good choices on my turn and after I choose between the turd sandwich or the giant douche, a terrific card replaces the card I took in the offering providing a great benefit for my opponent.  Some games that happens more than once and it's annoying.  I still love the game overall.  It is great for playing with non- or nascent gamers.  It has fun choices, great theming, its a great light game.  It is not a perfect game.  The randomness is a minor flaw.

A highly versatile DBG that is easy to come up with variants for or add more people into the fray (by buying more sets).

A great two-player game. I am sometimes pretty neutral about deck builders that, while mentally engaging, are mostly just sitting around and playing by yourself while others wait their turn to do the same.

A similar style game to Dominion, but also one that I think doesn't quite match up in playability or fun.  First of all, I want to applaud the artwork as it's absolutely brilliant and it really evokes the space exploration and combat theme beautifully.  Unfortunately, I wasn't a big fan of the gameplay, firstly I felt that attacking the other players could be a bit too political (wasn't in my case but it has the potential for other people to be that way), and although you can play it so you only attack to one side this then means that a strong player with a weak player to his right will win every time.  I also think that the bases mechanic was weird as often you buy them only to have them destroyed before you can use them.

It's nice that it plays quickly, and the problems I have with it are therefore bearable but I don't think I would seek out a game of this.

This game dethroned Ascension for me. I love Ascension but in my opinion there are insufficient interactions between the players. Star Realms is all about player interaction and I really like that.

Love the battling aspect of this deck builder.  So much better than Dominion.  Don't get me wrong, I do like Dominion but people that say Dominion is the best deck builder game is full of it.

Star Realms is a masterpiece. Incredibly simple to understand and introduce to new players, with super fast gameplay (20 mins). Fantastic artwork and characteristically unique factions offer a genuinely epic feeling to recruiting and molding your own army of spaceships to battle your opponent. Its amazing how much intrigue and excitement Star Realms manages to pack into such a short game! Due to its short play time, you can play multiple games in quick succession without losing any interest. This one really ticks all the boxes for me. It's hard not to love Star Realms!

RATING: 6
Played a partial game, seems choices are pretty limited and obvious but I need to play it further, you do see a little of the MTG influence but its much more like Dominion/Ascension (except Dominion the market is constant, here it changes which adds luck element)

Edit - Played about 8 games now, its a neat little mix of Dominion and Magic set in space, easy to learn, fun, great little price tag, plays in a fast amount of time, lots of positives here, really a great little filler game. 

My rating would be higher but what I said above stands for me, decisions are mostly limited and obvious, and of course luck plays a fairly big role (luck is somewhat forgivable given length of game). Sometimes you get a nice choice between cards, but other than this you just play out what is in front of you. Have only played 2 player, no interest in more than 2, feels like there is nothing more to explore after 3 - 5 games much like just about every pure DBG (and much unlike something like Mageknight, A Few Acres, etc)

7 has sort of become my 'competent, serviceable deck-builder' rating recently. Suffers from the same general problems I have with deck-builders where it's based on getting good combos but then you have no control of what cards come out together. Though this one gets around that very slightly by letting your cards key off of whole classes of other cards rather than working well together with a few specific other cards.

I still remember when Dominion first came into my life and I discovered what would become a whole new genre.  I still love that game, but it takes so long to set up!  Enter Star Realms, which I can set up, play, and pack up almost as fast as my Dominion set up time.  The strategy is different and perhaps a little more random due to how the trade row comes out versus knowing all the purchasable cards in advance, but I do not mind this.  My wife and I have been playing this constantly since we bought it.  You just get so much game for such little time investment!

EDIT, 8 plays in, increased score from 8 to 9.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Star Realms may be the quickest, most portable deckbuilding game out there, but it's also one of the least interesting ones for me. It reminds of Ascension (its spiritual predecessor) but with even an stronger dependency on factions and, as a result, a stronger dependency on the luck of the order in which they appear to the players.

I'd rather play Ascension (and, by extension for those who read my comment about Ascension, I'd rather play Dominion).

RATING: 7.5
This is a good introduction to deck building with great artwork and solid gameplay. Only 2 players and limited options for building your deck, combined with luck of the draw sometimes affecting you negatively detracts somewhat (and I don't like the method of keeping score), but nonetheless this is a fun and highly transportable little deck builder.

EDIT: Having played this a lot I have upped my rating. It's just as much fun with a fellow gamer as it is with my 7 year old. This is actually my favourite deckbuilder now, despite being pretty simplistic.

RATING: 10
I really hoped that I never used this cliche, but here goes: "I'm giving this game a 10 because I can't give it anything higher." God, I hate that cliche. But you know what: Totally appropriate in this case. Star Realms has everything I want in a game: Space/sci-fi theme, great artwork, quick and easy game play, pretty quick play time and (with the addition of the Gambit pack) the ability to play solo. It's also pretty inexpensive, and very portable - I fit the game plus an expansion pack (all sleeved) in a double-wide deck box.

Absolutely brilliant!


EDIT (2 Mar 2015): I didn't anticipate how addictive this game it. My whole family is hooked on it! We've also been playing the app version and I've picked up three expansions. Have also since picked up Ascension as well because I love the gameplay mechanics!

It's basically the same as [b][thing=69789]Ascension[/thing][/b] except with a space theme instead of a fantasy theme. The primary difference is that Star Realms is confrontational (the [i]only[/i] way to win is by beating the crap out of your opponent) whereas the basic Ascension game is 2-player solitaire.

I think I still prefer Ascension... although after a few more games of Star Realms I'm starting to like it more.

RATING: 10
It is extremely rare I give any game a 9 or a 10. This is definitely one of them. Great mix of CCG and card play, without all of the garbage baggage that comes along with CCG's. Quick to play with just enough options. Plenty of tension and some tough decisions. Base game can be harsh if you have money to spend but low cost cards keep turning up on your turn. But that's part of the fun of the game.

The Gambit cards help balance things by doing creative combos to get you back in the game or pull ahead. So if you do get jammed up with weaker cards, there's usually an out with the gambit cards. You just have to spot it and take advantage of it. You can make some nifty moves with the Gambit cards - the game rewards outside the box thinking.

Still, base game or with expansions, this is great bang for the buck value and is portable.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (September 2014)

I bought the game blindly, so it was a surprise when I found out it was an Ascension clone and from one of the designers from Ascension. It is basically the same thing, the currencies are called differently and now you have to kill your opponent, but it has the same core (two currencies, constructs/bases, factions).

I have played it twice, and it seems (so far) that the combat cards are more powerful than the rest. Love the space theme, but I don’t feel it very much. I really dislike the variable market offering. For me that takes away all the strategy from the game and replace it with lots of uncontrollable luck (pure tactics). I was able to win my first game by a lot using this tactic. I always bought the most expensive card I could afford, I didn’t even read the card and presto…. I won. In this kind of games, the luckiest payer will win, that is, the player who has the better cards in the market when is his turn will win. OBVIOUS decisions.

For me, it is ONLY a two player game, with more, the luck factor increases a lot, also player elimination is a huge disadvantage in the multiplayer game. The score system is a bit clunky and it is prone to cause mistakes/cheats, however it allows for the game to be cheap.

OK art, cards on the flimsy side. It can play fast (its main strength), otherwise the rating would be way lower.

Bottom line, I don’t like this kind of game, but for now I will keep my copy as it was very cheap. Also I prefer to play it in the iPad, there the games are much quicker so I don’t mind the uncontrollable luck. Had I played it only on the iPad, the rating would be a bit higher (as is Ascension). Miles away from Dominion.

One of the only contenders to the Dominion deck-building throne for me- the nuances between the four factions and the more-ish-ness of playing multiple games through the app or in paper are appealing. Will get the nod over Dominion sometimes due to ease of set up, but there are a few openings that can be unbeatable (and authority/life management is a hassle in real life).

The PC version of this game is amazingly fun. It almost feels like Dominion, but manages to be a bit more thematic - however not by much. But still a fun filler game to play every now and then.

This is a neat little quick playing deck builder. It's by the designers of Ascension, I think, and the mechanics are clearly evolved from that game (I'm not sure I'd call it an improvement, just different). It has factions, unite abilities, 2 types of currency (attack and money). The twists are in the fact that instead of monsters, you are attacking each other, and when you buy a card, you immediately play it (instead of it going straight into your discard). It's an interesting twist, and I quite like it.

Star Realms fixes everything that is wrong with Ascension. You feel like you're actually playing against your opponent instead of playing concurrent solo games.

Lots of little strategies possible with the four factions, ally and trash mechanics. Good value for money game, yet I wonder if the game will keep its charm after lots of play. The Authority cards to keep score are a bit of a hassle. I would've preferred four cards that can slide (as in [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/133473/sushi-go]sushi go[/url]) and I recommend using 2d10 instead of the cards provided.

Takes the basic model for Ascension (direct player conflict, revolving cards for purchase) and streamlines it down into a tight little package. The price is certainly right and you do get your money's worth. However, this game will get old for me very quickly. I can tolerate the inherent randomness of the deckbuilding mechanic, but why would I want to increase that randomness with a constantly evolving constellation of cards to purchase? Now do I not only need to draw the right cards, the right cards also need to be available for purchase. This was my main beef with Ascension and it is the same beef here. However, this is much cheaper, smaller and plays a lot quicker. For that, its weaknesses are easier to forgive.

This game has gotten surprisingly popular surprisingly fast and I have to think that is because of the app version, which is well-implemented. In fact, I think this game probably works better as an app. The constant addition and subtraction of points gets a bit tedious in actual card play.

UPDATE: So a few years later I am still playing this with my son (it is his game, not mine) and we always enjoy it when we do. For the longevity that I did not think was there, I am raising my score on this to an 8. I appreciate that this game has gotten my son more into gaming than anything else he has played.

REVISED 01/2016
After many many playthroughs, both with the cards and on the app version, I have come to realize that this game is far too luck-heavy for me. Yes, the cards are lovely, and yes it is fun, but early on I thought this was a game of deeper strategy. I cannot tell you how many games I have lost because of what was available in the trade row on my turns versus my opponent's turns. I knew all the right moves, but just couldn't make them. Frustrating IF you think you are playing a game rich in strategy. I have come to see that it is just a light filler game with a little longer play time than most fillers. Still like it, but just do not play it nearly as much anymore. END REVISION

The only deck builder I will ever own. I tried Dominion and Ascension first, and they didn't do it for me. Dominion was like playing a game of solitaire, but then scoring it competitively, at the end and both games seemed to suffer from too many expansions. How many f***ing cards does one game really need? My brother-in-law owns Dominion and a whole mess of expansion cards. The setup was tedious to say the least. I watched him selecting this stack, and then that stack, and then second guess and switch for another one. Too much going on for this type of game, in my opinion.

Star Realms is one shared deck that all players purchase from. Simple setup, AND even better: it's interactive, which solves my solitaire beef with Dominion. And at the time of this writing the game is still young, but so far, there have only been a few mini-expansions that add a handful of ships and bases, and a couple new minor mechanics.

A note to the developers: in future, I will no longer be interested in adding more cards to an already large trade deck. Diluting it further lowers the chances of any given card coming out in the trade row during any given game which decreases any ability to plan and strategize. If you want to continue getting my money - and the money of several others who have contributed to threads here on BGG about this excellent game - you should release an expansion that is a fully-realized new faction. The game would still play only 4 factions at a time, but you choose which 4 from the pool.

Even just one new faction drastically improves replay value. Release a few, and you'll keep us coming back for more. You get more of our money per purchase and we get a game that continues to surprise us with a trade deck that does not continue to inflate to cumbersome proportions. While I realize that this would make setup take longer, like I complained about Dominion and its expansions, but this will still not compare. Rifling through one deck and removing say all the blue cards and shuffling in a new color will be quicker than all the hemming and hawing and judgement calls needed to weave together all the different choices in a complete Dominion set.

I had this for a while and recently got it out.  It is great.  I played with my wife and with a 10 year old boy.
The boy was very excited about it and took to it right away.  He started telling me which cards I should buy, almost immediately.  I was surprised how quickly he picked it up.  He beat me 4 out of 5 games!

When both players know how to play,  it is very fast ... maybe 20 to 25 minutes.  There are many possible strategies and yet the basic rules are easy.  Nice artwork, low price, fits in your pocket.  Good game all around.

A fun deckbuilder which initially feels very similar to Ascension.  However, the different theme and variation in gameplay arising from needing to directly attack the other player makes having this game as well worthwhile.

RATING: 8
Bumped the rating from 7 to 8 after 14 plays over 3 days. Now that we're familiar with the cards the second-order strategies are starting to reveal themselves. Cards cannot always be considered in isolation, for example the average cost in the card row can impact what a 'good' decision is. Definitely a good sign. It has proven to be a very enjoyable game.

----------
I love how much game they managed to squeeze into a stack of cards with a $12 price tag! I'm not a huge fan of deck builders but I think this game might overcome my predisposition. It's very streamlined yet retains the flow and interesting decisions of the genre. It's quite fast and if you're willing to try out the multi-player modes there seems to be a lot of flexibility to the game play. I'm particularly interested in the co-op/solo modes which require promo cards which have not been released to retail channels yet. 

The 2p game is fast! Your deck ramps up quickly and before you know it you can blast people for 20+ damage on a turn. The four factions have well defined mechanical differences and it's interesting to play around with combos. 

Easily worth the price of admission, although we'll have to wait and see if it has any long term appeal.

Star Realms distillates the essence of deckbuilding into a small package. The combos are color-coded into four factions, making use of Star Realms as an introductory deckbuilder feasible. It's developed for two players although it has various multiplayer rules that appear to be more than an afterthought.
As most players, I got to know this via the app for this game. I'm not too fond of deckbuilding games but Star Realms works for me. It doesn't have the never-ending combos I dread so much in Dominion, the deck-thinning prerogative is only one of the four faction-induced focal strategies. The luck factor is higher than in most other games of this type but it's short enough that I'm fine with that.

17 Sept 14 - Have only played this on the iPad. A 10 for me. I love Dominion and Thunderstone Advance, and this is different enough from those to warrant getting it. Love the direct combat while still retaining the fun of drafting in cards for a more powerful deck.

Lots of different mechanisms here that make it worthwhile buying. Plays a LOT faster too. This is a real winner. Now...where to get my hands on a copy. :-)

24 Sept - Still loving this. This is combo heaven. Originally, thought the Blobs were way overpowered, but all factions are powerful, esp. when you collect a few of the same faction. 
Have bought the Windows version too. Can't get enough of it. Apparently, out of print but found a copy on Ebay. Reprint being done end of October apparently. Can't wait.

I believe this is the best entry-level game into "deck building" and would recommend it over Dominion to anyone. On the negative side, it really is only good with 2 players or 4 (teams of 2 in 2v2). It is very easy to learn and play and a bit better than hero realms in my opinion.

The more I play this game, the less I enjoy it. I've played the app nearly a hundred times. I find the heuristics and the effects of luck on the strategy to be terrible.

There have been a significant number of times where I realize the game was basically coming down to who had best timing of the cards drawn paired with the timing of the best cards available to buy.

There are some nice mechanics designed with the game. There are some really quite good ideas. Nice artwork. But it's a frustrating game that has a thin veneer of strategy.

I understand that many find Dominion to have a boring theme, so I guess the theme goes a long way here. Personally, neither one is unique or exciting, but the problem here is the same as all other deck builders. Why play this over Dominion? I've only played 2-player, and this seems ideal for 2. Having to choose who to attack seems like it would ruin the game for me. In a game like Coup, which is over in 10 minutes, it's no big deal, but in a longer game it's not a trait I would want to see in a game.

I can see how the setup is simpler, but the cards as they stand now just aren't very exciting and don't offer anything I haven't already seen done better in Dominion.

I haven't stopped playing this game since I picked it up.  Loved it so much I even got the digital app.  It is exactly the deck building game that I have been looking for for years.  It has found away to combine and balance all of the things I love about Magic: The Gathering, Dominion, and Ascension without all of the things I hate about Magic: The Gathering, Dominion, and Ascension.  It's very streamlined and very well balanced between the different factions.  
I don't hand out ratings of 10 lightly, and I can't recommend it enough.

I very unique and exciting deck building game that is fast enough so you can play it almost any time.

They are usually really fun.

RATING: 8.5
Such a cool take on deckbuilders, changing it from point salads to destroying your opponent. Love the combo factions mechanism, love the mega turns they allow you to pull off, love the trash now for extra benefits, and love how it takes 10-15 minutes to go through a game while we wait for the rest of the group to show up.

Games get pretty repetitive after 15+ though, and I'm fine playing it only once a year. Or never. Feel like I've seen everything it has to offer.

That feeling has been fixed by the United expansions. So much new stuff, pretty mind blowing.

RATING: 8
Probably my favourite game of pure deckbuilding, indicating along with Puzzle Strike that deckbuilders work best as confrontative two-player games. Not sure about replayability, but there are a lot of different ways to combine the cards that come with the base game. The trigger mechanism does generate some luck of the draw; for instance, if you're focusing on two colours and could draw matched or unmatched pairs in two hands, you're either going to trigger all four cards, or none at all.

Update: Raised to 8 because after all this is easily my most played game.

RATING: 10
Counting online, this is by far my most played game.  An incredible design, and the fact that it's contained in a box barely larger than a deck of standard playing cards and retails for $15 is just gravy.  The portability means you can take it anywhere, it's fast and easy to set up, and typically plays in 15-20 minutes.  Sounds like the perfect filler, right?  And yet it is so much more.  Do not be fooled by the high variance/luck factor, there is a lot of skill needed to do well at this game.  It is more like poker than chess, where optimal play will not always win, but over the long haul you will win more than you lose.

As compared to Dominion, it is more tactical and less strategic since there is a variable "trade row" of cards you can buy and add to your deck (as in Ascension which I have not played).  This adds more luck/variance to the equation, but the upside is tremendous replayability as no two games are ever alike.  It is also more thematic with much better artwork (not that that's too high a bar lol).  Also, even though a number of great expansions have been released, they are not necessary to enjoy the game for a long time, unlike base Dominion which got stale after a shorter period.

About the only downside is that scoring and keeping track of different card combos in play can be a little tedious when playing face to face.  The game comes with double-sided score cards in different denominations (1/5, and 10/20) that you flip over to keep track of your score.  Some people hate these, but I for one appreciate that the designers included a card-based scorekeeping mechanism that could fit into the small tuckbox in which the game comes packaged.  

I will also mention there is a great online community of players, including a BGG Star Realms league, and one-off tournaments run through the fan-created facebook page.  

approximate number of plays (pre-2017):  100+

Fantastic game. Really well done, and surprising in its depth and addictiveness!

I picked this up at the FLGS on impulse. Last night, my regular Dominion group was scheduled to come over, but all but one canceled, so I introduced this to him (he is also a regular Star Wars LCG opponent of mine). He loved it more than I dared hope, and we played four rapid fire games. He was so impressed (as was I) that I went out today and bought a second copy.

I loved the gameplay. The four factions are distinct, and there is often an unhappy choice as to what to buy - you often want more than one option, but the ally ability is so key, that it really encourages you to streamline your deck!

I want more cards and options already, and am looking forward to some 3- and 4-player games soon.

The cards themselves are really great. I ripple shuffled them and they had a good snap to them, but side-shuffling left some minor nicks on them, so I ended up sleeving them in my normal KMC Clears. Now the stack of cards is high enough that adding a second 80-card stack is going to require some special accoutrements.

The life counting is a little fiddly - I forsook the enclosed cards, really wishing they had instead printed other usable cards on them, and used pen-and-paper (i played all 4 games with my pencil over my right ear...). This is really the only reason I gave the game a 9.5. The art is great but not jaw-dropping, and the names of the cards are a little silly (the Battle Mech is a ship...and one race are the "Blobs"...) but the mechanics and play are really enjoyable. I highly recommend this and am looking forward to other expansions!

Awesome fun playing cooperatively against the Nemesis Beast- if you find it too easy I suggest wrecking the "mana curve" in the deck for more of a challenge. The expansions are okay but the only "must-buy" is the Bases and Battleships for the amount of Chrome it contains....and the Events booster is fun for the chaos that an unexpected Supernova can cause!

Got hooked on this bad via the free iOS app.  Bought the base game and plan to try it with our 8 year son and/or my wife.

Wow, this game is addicting. I never before did the dominion thing so this scratches an itch I never even knew I had. If you have played dominion, this is a more streamlined futuristic-themed version of that. You play to heal yourself and hurt your enemy, no objectives. Games are quick (with the right opponent(s)) at about 15 min and teaching takes only 5 min. However a new player will need 2-3 games before it clicks. By far one of the best time fillers.

I wish the deck building wasn't so exponential so you had more time to play with your powerful ass deck, but that's the only downfall. Very fun game, I have played over twenty times and still enjoy myself.

A fast paced card game that is easy to learn and fun to play. The rules are simple and decisions are straightforward but there is more depth than it first appears. This combined with a quick play time makes this one a winner that keeps you coming back for more.

It is a deck builder where you build your deck as you play. Each turn you are buying cards to place into your own deck and, while you are sure to have favorites, the value of every card really depends on the current game state (what else is in your deck? what else is in your opponents deck? what else is available to buy? how close are we to the end? etc). Evaluating this is what keeps the game fresh as, though it usually seems like a pretty easy decision what to buy, it is actually hard to be 100% certain that is the best decision.

A rework of Ascension that just works better for 2, due to the direct attacking. The star ship theme is cool and the different colored cards all have fairly different takes on them.

I've never been into deck builder games, but throw anything space oriented in front of me, and I'll drool over it and demand to play it. This takes very similar mechanics found in games like Ascension, and takes it down a sci fi outer space theme. 

Games are solid, you can play multiplayer (if you buy additional starter deck cards and life cards).

RATING: 6
Goofy deck building game, with lots of direct interaction. At its core, it's very similar to Ascension, a game from the same designers. Thankfully, this one is way more polished and balanced.

While the deck building component is interesting, the way the cards are drafted makes mitigating the luck factor difficult. While all card games have an inherit luck component, in Star Realms it's higher than average. Even though experienced players will consistently trump newbies, in terms of equal skill between players, games are decided by sheer luck more often than I would've liked.

But considering the game is both short and has a high take-that component, I don't find the aforementioned luck factor to be that much of an issue. The flow of play is fun and engaging when draws are balanced and, when they're not, the game ends swiftly enough to not become frustrating.

All in all, fun but not great. If I had to draw comparisons with other games, I'd say it's Mag Blast meets Dominion: it's got the goofiness and direct confrontation of the first, mixed with the deck building component of the latter. It's also easy to teach, which is always a plus. 

P.S.: I'm very intrigued by the expansion which introduces a co-op mode.

There is a very dominant card-draw-strategy with which one can draw through its entire deck each turn. This one for sure wins if the engine starts to run. Especially dangerous in multiplayer games. Less a problem in multiplayer with colony wars together and each set only once in play. My rating refers to that constellation.

I had to change it to a '10' before writing this description. It's just so good. It's an deck-building game that can lead to some massive combos to destroy your opponent. It can get really tense towards the end! For $15, everyone interested in board games should buy this game. The sci-fi theme may throw people off, but just look past it. Trust me!

Very similar to Ascension (one of my favorites). 

Star Realms is different in all combat is against the other player and the factions in Star Realms mean something as opposed to ascension.  More reason for going for cards of a certain faction rather than Ascension does.  Love the "Ally" feature.

Initial impressions were quite positive, but further play reveals too many flaws. This game is on the brink of being very good, but ends up disappointing instead. 

Too many games are blow outs because one person got good cards early. Early outposts mean no damage being done, likely for several turns, putting one player far behind. Cards that heal are severely under costed. $2 for a card that heals 4, provides $2, and has a 4 damage ally ability. It's just silly.

Of our 8 games maybe 2 were a decent match where either of us could have won. The rest were extremely lopsided victories with no fault to put on the players.

This game is 99% luck, still 1% better than Hearthstone, but that's not saying a lot. You will get screwed over by this game a lot. Prepare to do nothing wrong and gets slaughtered 50+ to -10+ based on nothing but "You get a good card but reveal a great card your opponent gets on their turn." Or, the always wonderful "You never combo even with 5 of the same faction in your deck but your opponent manages to combo every single time." Or try the "They always just happen to get the precise Trade to get the great card in the offer the turn before you can buy it." Or the great one "You are always 1 Trade short of buying any of the good cards no matter how many good trade-based cards are in your deck."

You will rage quit this game so many times over these, and I didn't even mention that the game can easily be called on Turn 1 if the Freighter is in the offer because whoever gets that card will win 99% of the time. Don't buy this game, and don't buy the App/PC version. It's bad for your health.

RATING: 7
Star Realms is a fast paced deck-building card game of outer space combat. It combines the fun of a deck-building game with the interactivity of Trading Card Game style combat. As you play, you make use of Trade to acquire new Ships and Bases from the cards being turned face up in the Trade Row from the Trade Deck. You use the Ships and Bases you acquire to either generate more Trade or to generate Combat to attack your opponent and their bases. When you reduce your opponent’s score (called Authority) to zero, you win!

RATING: 7
I only played the app so far. I still find the game interesting, it does not surpass Rune Age which is best from my point of view.

I dislike the common pool of cards for drafting but at 2 players it does not change much and most cards have no text, so its half a problem. I still prefer private pools like in Rune Age.

I like cards that can self destruct themselves for additional abilities. They encourage focusing drafting  same faction, but you might not survive without the help of other factions. Since all cards have synergies with other cards of the same color, it makes balancing easier.

After reading other people's comment, it could be true that it plays better as an app since it's quick and will mitigate bad luck when playing single player. There are some cards more powerful than others for the same cost, but in general the game is roughly balanced.

The app offer the Challenge mode which seems more strategic than the base game. So it's possible that the real card game becomes boring more quickly.

Final important note, this game is one of the few deck building card games that has the possibility to attack or interact directly with your opponent. This is normally something I search in deck building game, Rune Age being the first game that did this, but few designer seems interested in doing that. Just because of that, I'll give a +1 to the game's rating.

Star Realms is a deckbuilding game set in a sci-fi universe featuring four warring star fleets. As in any deckbuilding game you're playing cards in order to acquire other cards that offer you better playing options. The four different factions offer interesting combinations with powerful effects when played together. The objective of the game is to reduce your opponents authority (hitpoints) from 50 to zero.

I wasn't that impressed with Star Realms when I first played it.  But after multiple plays during which I've come to learn the cards and faction powers, I started enjoying the game more and more. I love the theme. And even though my wife doesn't like the theme, she does like the game and is very good at it. For that reason, it'll probably stay in our collection for a long time.

Star Realms shocked me, like how seeing your ex with riding a bull would probably shock you. I thought I was done with deckbuilder games after my love of Thunderstone faded and I just felt deckbuilder fatigue. Every game seemed to be the same abstracted slog that really wasn't scratching any itches that I had. I, like many of you, had heard about this new deckbuilder that was only $15 and extremely hard to get your hands on. So when I went ot GenCon 2014 and saw they had a good number of tables running demos I decided to give it a shot, and I am so glad I did. This game is what every deckbuilder wishes it could be. It has direct player interaction, and extremely streamlined gameplay. With four factions, and numerous different types of ships the synnergy strategies are nearly endless. When I first got the game I thought sticking to 2 factions was going to be the primary winning strategy for this game, but I have seen so many other strong strategies that I know that the depth of gameplay is there. Many are saying Star Realms is similar to Ascension and that is a fair assesment, but it is also a lot more fun than Ascension. With the introduction to semi-permanent cards (Bases), synergy bonuses (Faction Bonuses), and trashing abilities the game is culmination of five years of deckbuilding history, and while it stands on the shoulders of it's predecessors it also reaches heights that are unheard of for any other deck builder. After playing my demo game I showed it to all four of the people in my group at GenCon and 3 of them bought the game. The price point combined with the streamlined and easy game play is absolute winner. When you can, do yourself a favor and buy Star Realms.

This game was getting a lot of buzz, but I was not expecting to like it as much as I do. I was also not expecting how much of a hit it would be with my friends (especially those who are the hardest to get to the gaming table). This game is fast and incredibly accessible, but still with lots of strategic depth and plenty of replayability (even though it comes in a small deck box). I think White Wizard have a potential crossover hit on their hands, and I hope to see plenty of support for it the future.

Really a great game all-around.  The fastest deckbuilder and also the simplest to teach.  The strategy is also a lot deeper than you'd initially think; I'm a long-time deckbuilder player and even after playing this 100 times I realize I am not a master as I don't win every game.  The only drawback is that a fair amount of luck is involved, but that's to be expected for being a LIGHT game.  

At the same time, the main selling point is it is SO easy to learn; just four factions and two types of cards.  There are more types of cards in the Crisis expansions, which are GREAT btw; simple but add a couple more elements with hero cards that you use once at an opportune moment and event cards that effect everyone immediately when they come up.  

Lots of replayability, good light strategy that's deeper than it looks, great art, very elegant game, and amazing price point to boot.  Although I would recommend sleeving your cards and buying the $20 long deckbox, you still come out ahead of a normal deckbuilder game.  Truly all you could want in a game.

UPDATE: the one thing I don't like is that there is a lot more randomness to winning than I thought.  It feels like only 20% skill, 80% randomness, whereas I thought it was more the other way around at first.  This is a filler game, of course.  The games really do only take 15 minutes.  And I use this on people who don't play games, so it makes them feel good to actually win sometimes.  So it's a drawback but not a dealbreaker.

It is a fast and fun deck building game where you are trying to build up your fleet as fast as possible, build & use protective bases & defeat your opponents life, or what they call authority. A wonderful game & I've enjoyed the Crisis expansions a lot as well.

RATING: 6
I really wanted to like this game because it is one of the few deck builders that has a lot of interaction, but it is possible to burst down your opponents really quickly and so there isn't as much time to build up your deck as I'd like in this game (alternatively, if the game is going slowly outposts are really powerful since it prevents your opponent from whittling you down while giving you passive effects and providing the necessary color to activate your ships' additional abilities, and when they get destroyed they can come out in a couple turns again if your opponent deck thins). At least the quick bursting down of your opponents mean since you don't use that many cards each game you can get a lot of plays before the game becomes stale.

EDIT: I still don't think it's balanced very well, but it's just so addictive. Overrated but still has a niche

EDIT 2 after playing over 200 times vs. the app AI: Still extremely addicting, but god is this game swingy. Based on what cards show up after you draft them from the central row your opponents might get insane color combos, or just luck out with a couple cards they have left, or getting your +3 money outpost at the start of your card draw instead of at the end, any of these factors can basically mean game over for the opponent. Completely unacceptable if this game was longer.

RATING: 8
So much fun packed in such a tiny box! After having so many cards spread all over a table, it’s incredibly satisfying to have everything shrink down into something you can fit in a pocket. I ended up with this game sort of on accident—super happy I did.

I was pretty frustrated with the instructions; I thought they weren’t written well and it took me a long time to understand the game from reading through them. But once I started playing, it was a breeze and everything made sense.

My husband seems to be addicted to this game. This is a major triumph because he generally dislikes games and it took me a few hours to convince him to play with me, which he did mostly out of pity (I had been playing both players by myself). But then he very willingly played at least 4 more times then, and we didn’t really get anything else done the next two days.

Note: I was pretty sure we’d like it because we got similarly addicted to Dominion.

Sometimes this feels a little too luck-based. I can’t consistently win because my cards foil me too often. Especially early on, you can lose out on some significant stuff if your first few hands happened to be off.

It's a very, [i]very[/i] simple deck-builder.  It didn't really clear the bar of simplicity that Dominion set, and that's saying something.  However, it's easy to teach and easy to play.  The mechanic don't wow; anything that they did, Rune Age and Core Worlds already did, and did better.  However, you could go worse if you found this for $7 or $8.

Gave the physical version away since I never played it. I play the app and have over 3000 plays. 

Quick and addicting, but such a simple system with great combos that still hasn't gotten old after so many plays.

Only downside is the randomness of cards in the trade market. Sometimes things just don't line up for you, however there is definitely something to be said about strategy and overall evaluation of individual cards and their value at certain stages of the game cross referenced with what other cards you already own.

UPDATE: reacquired in a trade.

RATING: 8
I'm told this plays similarly to Ascension, though I don't have a first-hand basis for that.

Star Realms is a fairly simple deckbuilder whose primary virtue is its ease of portability / setup / takedown. A starter deck for each player, a single always-available purchase deck roughly analogous to Silver in Dominion, and a single shuffle-everything deck for purchase.

Two players compete head-to-head over the cards currently available for purchase, and so the game is substantially more tactical than strategic. The purchasing system can be undeniably swingy (for instance, if one better-than-the-rest income card is up for grabs early). For a short light game that lends itself to multiple plays in a row, I think that's fine.

RATING: 8
Type: directly competitive deckbuilder

Best with: 2 players
Weight: Light
Duration: 5-25 minutes
Notes:
direct damage competitive
not much strategy, mostly tactical
luck based on card draw from built decks as the game goes on

Star Realms is a remarkably approachable and portable deck-building card game. Both players start with a basic deck of cards. They purchase additional cards from the tableau in the middle, and then attack the other player with attack cards until only one is left standing.

On the upside, this game is about as basic and simple as a deckbuilder game will get. It is head-to-head, which is a nice thing to have, since many deckbuilders are coop or more like multiplayer solitaire in nature. Despite the simplicity, the sheer number of cards available in the base deck mean this game always looks different each time you play it, and there can be some strategic choices you need to make when looking at card synergy and the balance between defense and offense.

On the downside, there are not many tricks to be had. You just need to attempt to find some synergy in the cards you purchase, ramp your deck up smoothly, and hope luck is on your side. Beyond that, the game strips the deckbuilder head-to-head genre down to its raw basics.

Also, not all players will appreciate the bash-each-other 2 player game, but the game is quick and wins can go back and forth pretty quickly.

Lastly, it must be mentioned that the score-tracking mechanism is based on actual cards with number values on them which you add to or subtract as damage is dealt. While I sympathize with the intent to make the game as portable as possible, this score-tracking is terrible and should be replaced with a few 2d10 dice for each player. Even a rotating counter that is card-sized would be a better option.

Sometimes, this game is a bit too light for my tastes. Maybe I want something a little deeper like a Thunderstone match, or a few rounds of Lord of the Rings, or even Pixel Tactics or Magic to get my card game fix. At other times, though, this game is just right for some light, quick card action.

Overall, this game is excellent to just have in a back pocket and whip out while on a train, in a waiting room, or at a con with a buddy or even strangers. Easy game to set up and teach, as well. Merges somewhat seamlessly into a 3-4 player game, even if you don't cart along all of the purchasable cards each time.

Similar games in my collection: Magic: The Gathering (1-on-1 customizable card game), Puzzle Strike (multiplayer competitive deckbuilder), Legendary (coop deckbuilder), Thunderstone Advance (coop deckbuilder),

Deckbuilding stripped down to its core. It's not exceptionally deep, but it's still a nice quick game you can easily teach to anyone.

There are a few cards that can easily throw a player far in the lead if aquired early. Colony Wars, if played standalone, lacks this issue as far as I can tell.

Quick. Easy to learn, difficult to master. The card artwork is very pretty. Well-balanced with each game feeling different.

The digital version is also very good, but slightly limited (in that some moves are not supported on the digital version).

RATING: 7
An interesting two player game where you put out ships that can attack other players and give you the ability to obtain more expensive ships from a central queue of ships.  On a turn you can buy more ships, play cards and attack your opponent.  First player to wipe out 50 life from the other player wins.  It has a Magic the Gathering feel but with a space theme.  It is lighter than Magic though.  I like it but it is not the great game that MtG is.

I've wondered about this game for a while. The art and theme are so appealing. I originally put off buying it because I wanted to buy the expansions too, and one of them has been out of print for a while. I decided to try the digital version on my phone. The mechanic of this game is flawed. While deck building games usually make you acquire V.P., this one makes use of life points (authority) instead. So basically, you have to chip away at your opponent's H.P. before he/she get yours down to zero. If they managed to fix that, then this would be a great game, but as it is, the game is too short which make developing a strong strategy (or any strategy for a matter of fact) impossible. I'm glad I didn't waste my money on this one. If you want a good deck builder, go for Ascension. I'll say this at least for Star Realms, it's better than Dominion. But then again, any DB is.

It's a very good deckbuilding game, which improves with repeated plays.  Well balanced, easy to learn, and fun to play.  Frustrating in the beginning if you are not familiar with the basic deckbuilding mechanics, but easy to improve after a few matches.  I don't like the art, but that's a minor quibble.  It just is not compelling enough to me to propose it, but will play it if asked to and I don't have something I would rather play instead, especially since it's quick and fun.

Simply OK. A 6 may be a bit generous for this title. Very little theme. Artwork is good and likely the best part about the game. It doesn't feel like playing a Sci-Fi game at all. Just a number cruncher, card optimization and luck of the draw. There are plenty of other games I would prefer to play over this. After thinking about it more, a 6 is probably much too generous. But only after 1 play I'll give it the benefit of the doubt.

Star realms is my favourite deck builder simply due to theme, speed, ease and size. The small box and table space required is a big plus, its so easy to throw it in the bag as you head out the door. The space theme works well with the 4 factions all working nicely. I will admit though, the blob ships aren't really very interesting theme wise. The game is fairly quick and games rarely run long. Expansions only add more...

Quick and fun deckbuilding game with a bit of an MtG feel because of the "duel" aspect and the fact that the goal of the game is to reduce your opponent's life points (yeah, "reputation"...) to zero.
I slightly dislike the trade row, sometimes there are just no good cards available, but I understand that is part of the design and it does help to keep the game fresh, you can't go for the same old strategy every time.

This game is fabulous. There isn't much depth, but it is an interesting take on deck-building and it plays quickly and easily with minimal setup. (We use d10s instead of cards to keep score.) It is perfect to play while you are waiting for dinner to cook.

We've recently gotten involved with Star Realms twin brother, Hero Realms. I consider these to be the same game, though the addition of the Hero decks makes games last a bit longer and be more interesting. I wish they would do something similar for the original game.

At first glance, this may seem to be just a simplified rerig of Ascension, but the changes make for a very different game. And a better one, if compared to only the Core Set of Ascension. Apart from excellent faction differentiation, I especially like the use of bases for both defense and some additional power during a turn. With very little rules overhead, they add interesting decisions when attacking your opponent.

I haven’t tried any of the multiplayer variants yet, but the two-player duel is short, tense and addictive as hell. And the card illustrations are excellent, even if they’re not as unique as the quirky art in Ascension.

A fun little card game that's easy to learn and easy to play, but with very little depth to it. Your only real strategic decision is in which cards you purchase, and even then, there's no guarantee you'll get those cards when you need them. Someone can be chipping away at their opponent's health, only to have their opponent play something crazy like 20+ damage in a single turn due to nothing else but luck of the draw.

And while everyone has the opportunity to have crazy draws like this, it usually ends up (at least when I've played it) that one person completely obliterates the other, with their opponent having no real way to retaliate.

RATING: 8.8
Fast-playing, easy to set up, and adds a science fiction theme to deck-building, which is one of my favorite mechanisms. We're okay with the direct attack nature of this game because you don't actually lose the items that are destroyed. They simply go back in your deck and come out again.

(We own the following packs alongside the base game: Cosmic Gambit Set, Crisis - Bases & Battleships, Crisis - Events, Crisis - Fleets & Fortresses, Crisis - Heroes, Gambit Set, United - Assault, United - Command, United - Heroes, United - Missions.)

My spouse likes this one so I will keep it, but it pales in comparison to Cthulhu Realms.  The game play is fun, but once you know the cards the decisions are much less interesting, and with two players that know the game, the victory often comes down to the luck of what cards come to the market when.

A better streamlined version of Ascension basically. Trades generic fantasy for space theme but improves by going to one currency and attacking instead of 2 currencies and vp's. Much better package as well. Like ascension quite shallow though and the game plays you mostly with obvious choices most of the time.

A really addictive deckbuilder game. It does not have a lot of depth, but it does not matter as games are so fast that you can play some games in succession.

RATING: 9
Hot damn, Star Realms is a tight, taut, humming ball of awesome.

It has almost none of the ramp-up that's typical of so many deckbuilders: You're buying pretty amazing shit right away, and then a turn or two later you're carving off your opponent's Authority in great swaths. It has that knife-fight-in-a-phone-booth feel that I love in Neuroshima Hex!, but packed into a pure deckbuilder; that's fantastic.

The whole game is just so well executed, with gorgeous artwork, clear card iconography and text, a microscopic rules footprint, smooth gameplay, so much delicious tension, a short play time, and a shockingly low price. Sleeve it, pack it all into a bi-fold deck box, and bam! Instant awesome in a tiny package.

Bought at Kingslayer Comics.

400 count deck box: $20 + Tax 

Amazing game.  The interactions between faction cards make for some great combos.  Each faction also synergizes with others in different ways.  I like the attack mechanism more than Ascension's VP system.  It's much easier to think about attacking an opponent rather than how much value my deck currently holds.

Update 3/10/16.  Rating dropped from 8.5 to 7.5.  While I still think the game is good, it doesn't see play as often as I thought it would.  The game is fast and fun, but it's missing complexity I get from most of our other games.

You can keep your boring microgames that are fun for one or two games only. This is my type of microgame! It fits in pocket but is still a proper game that's not built around one gimmick only. Very derivative of Dominion, but I haven't played Dominion in ages so I wasn't bothered by it that much. Bit faster to setup but that's just because it has smaller cardpool, which is actually a negative thing so not sure if you can call that a plus. Traderow balances it a little. It has no chance to replace Dominion, sheer amount of expansions makes the original deckbuilder still the best choice on market, but if you are burned out on it like me and/or want something smaller this is a good choice.

A brilliant two player deck building game, that can be expanded to 3-4 players by purchasing another set.

I played this game a lot more on the app than my registered plays. I'm biased: it's deckbuilding, and I don't like that. I love the theme (however, making up an army of all factions is a bit strange). The problem I have with this game, is that I can't specialise in one faction. It's too random for that: sometimes the cards for that one faction don't come out, or come out when it's too late.

I also like how the cards interact, so you can plan a bit and hope for the right cards on the right time.

I will not turn down a game, but I won't actively seek this game out to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I love space games and card games... and I enjoy deck-building... and yet this game falls kind of flat. What was good about Dominion was the ability to always know everything that's available and make a strategy based on that. This takes that away and makes the available cards random....
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Deck building 101. If you've never played a deck builder and don't want to dive straight into the deep end (this was my first deck builder), this is a good gateway game. Building a good deck requires skill and some knowledge of the available cards, but the low complexity also means that luck plays a large factor in terms of both which cards come out in the display area and which cards you deal yourself with each reshuffle of your deck.  That makes the game great for imbalanced opponents--newbies won't necessarily get crushed as long as they thoroughly understand the basics.

Once played a few times the base deck feels a bit plain since there aren't that many special ability types (those beyond the basic attack, get currency to buy cards, and get life points back).  Expansion card packs are coming that promise to shake things up with events, personages, etc., so a solid base game could become more interesting and lively in time.  We'll see.

Pretty artwork, which never hurts.

Quickest, smoothest deck builder with reasonably fast ramp up and easily understandable iconography. There is no one good path to victory as the cards are very different but the game does reward an efficient deck. One of the most streamlined game I have played and unless you hate deck building, everyone should try this.

I think the game tries to be a little more competitive than it is. I appreciate the snowballing that happens, and I think that's good. If there were a way to be more purposeful in your deck building rather than having to solely react to what's available, that would be better.

The heroes expansion fixes a lot of what I didn't like about the core set.

Fun with lightning quick setup. It's satisfying to pull off a thirty point turn and make a comeback.  As I reflect on it though, I wonder how much strategy I really use when playing this.

The Mortal Kombat of card games, huge power combos are possible. Runs very short for the most part, hence it's a bit unsatisfying because it feels like it's over before you've got into it. Maybe start with 100 reputation (or whatever it's called)? Not bad, but definitely over-rated. Will the expansions improve the experience? Probably. Do I care. Probably not. If I can't even be bothered to remember what your 'life' points are called, then I guess I'm not at all fired up.

Simply put, this is the deck builder I always imagined.  Compact as a good card game designed for duels should be but balanced and as a masterwork.  Games should reveals themselves as player learn, grow, with repeat and new opponents.  Few deck builders do this, but Star Realms is rock solid.  Take note everybody, they did everything we wanted, and they did it for under $10...

If I first play a deckbuilder it has to feel more substantial than this - which means Dominion is where I'm at. A neat game nonetheless with a small footprint, but I found it more convoluted and less rewarding than it should be - like it falls between cracks, not sufficiently simple to be just a quick card game and not sufficiently interesting for the effort you put into it.

Also, after playing it digitally it suffers the same fate as Dominion - playing in person no longer feels attractive due to shuffling and the added time to each game.

Quite the enjoyable little deckbuilder in a box. The game play is fantastic but I've never been a fan of space theme games.

Update: Brought this on a campout for my Boy Scouts. It got played from 7 until probably 11:30 that night. They really liked it.

Update 2.0: I hosted a tournament with 9 people playing. Half were the young men in the youth group and the rest were the adults. Everyone had an enjoyable experience and I was able to place an order for 5 decks that everyone bought. So now that we can have 7 games going at once, we'll have to do it again.

Update 3.0: Hosted another tournament. My wife won it again against 8 people. It lends itself very well to an 8 person tournament.

[microbadge=1714]  [microbadge=21390]

02-Jul-2015:  This is a 2P deckbuilder with options for solo play.  The difference with this one is that you are attacking your opponent (reducing their score) rather than trying to gain VPs.  There are four factions in the game that are all played in conjunction with each other.  However, playing multiple cards of the same faction will provide extra actions or bonuses of some kind.  It's all about comboing those cards and building a powerful deck faster than your opponent.  It plays super fast and is very portable.

As for the solo game, there are two main options, both of which can be found online or in one of the expansion packs.  I have found the Pirates to be very random in terms of the difficulty level.  But the Nemesis Beast is pretty consistent.  Both solo variants play well enough though and provide a good sense of the game for the player.  However, a fellow solo gamer (ShaunGamer) has set up a wonderful set of solo challenges ([geeklist=189611][/geeklist]), including new AI enemies.  Wow!  You have to love the level of commit found around here.  It's just great.

So when taking into account all of these options, I'm very happy to have this little game in my collection.

(I usually do not keep old comments to avoid spam. In this case I am leaving it as a reminder for myself to be less hasty with first impressions.)

Not interested. Makes PvP central element of game but other than that it is quite derivative of Ascension. My guess(!) is also that the setting limits the design space for cool card abilities.

I don't think this will appeal if one does not like Ascension.

Update: Played it five times during a workshop and really liked it. I'd still say that I like Ascension better, but it is a good game nonetheless.

Bought on the way home from the workshop. My wife likes it too and has actively requested playing.

Played this last Sunday with a friend, initially as an openener to an extended afternoon/evening of gaming. In the end we became completely obsessed and played 14 rounds, only stopping when there was dinner and the need to move to something for four players.

This is now a 10 for me.

The good stuff first...it's inexpensive, portable, easy to learn, quick to play, visually clean and attractive.

But as far as the design and balance of the game, it's REALLY lazy, and doesn't do nearly enough to reduce the element of luck.  Every deck builder has an element of luck, but in Star Realms, once players understand basic stuff, every game is basically a coin flip.  That's not to say streaks won't happen, but it won't be the result of discovering a new layer to the game and elevating your play...or, conversely, having a strategy that your opponent effectively counters...it will just be luck.   

Luck is most influential early in the game, before the first shuffle.  In probably half of games, one player, through pure luck, has a significantly better hand after their first two turns.  It then becomes statistically probable that they are able to utilize that advantage before the second shuffle, and further increase their advantage.  So even though the role of luck tapers off over time, it just means that having the edge in luck early on is hugely more important than at any other time in the game.  

In the digital version, I've finished as high as #55 on the monthly leaderboard, so I think I understand the game on a deep enough level to say how shallow it is.  I would say 80% of my wins were pure luck, 17.5% were my opponents obviously buying the wrong cards, and maybe 2.5% were at least somewhat the result of doing something somewhat clever.

As an introduction to deck building, maybe it's okay, but even then I think I'd rather just teach someone Dominion.

An awesome and very entertaining game! It has some elements from Dominion, but its game mechanics and theme make it a much better game than Dominion in my humble opinion and that of so many other people who consider this game their favourite deck builder. In order to win you have to make your opponent lose all his authority or in other words health, so you basically need to defeat him by force. You can purchase many different kinds of spaceships and bases which help you to fulfil your objective. These cards either give you some kind of ability, give damage to your opponent's authority, give you some more authority or grant you more resources to buy even stronger cards. Besides building your own deck and battling with your opponent, the game is pretty short and makes for an amusing little game to play. I cannot recommend it enough! It offers you so much joy and fun for such a tiny little compact box - if you can even call it a box - which can be stored away easily or brought along when traveling! It's one of the top three best deck building games I've ever played, if not my favourite! Don't think - just get it!

RATING: 7
Very fast, very interactive, very fun deckbuilder.  All the "races" seem fairly balanced and poses some critical choices between getting the 'best card' in the trade row vs. a good card which will have a higher likelihood of triggering synergies with other cards you are running in your deck.  There are some cards which are nearly game-winning in and of themselves (early Brainworld or Fleet HQ), and the game seems to escalate a little too quickly (doing 5-10 damage in one 'round' to 40+ the next).  Had a physical copy but gifted it, still have the full digital game and will probably get another physical copy.

This game is Ascension with the addition of hit points. There are few things as unsatisfying as going through dozens of turns, losing points after unyielding attacks and then on your last turn you pull your fucking starting hand again and then DIE. I like it fine, but secretly i hate it.  It is fine though, really. (i hate it) There are expansions! (i don't care) 5 out of 10 unpleasant re-themes.

A Dominion sci-fi változatának is tekinthető a játék, hiszen hasonló pakliépítő mechanikát alkalmaz, csak itt űrbirodalmat építünk és nem hűbérurak vagyunk.

A két klasszikus deck builder között a másik nagy különbség, hogy a Star Realms kifejezetten konfrontatív, a Dominion pedig az Intrika kiegészítő nélkül gyakorlatilag egy felturbózott pasziánsznak tekinthető.

A játék mechanizmusa, hangulata, a lapok által kialakítható kombók mind-mind szuperlatívuszokban írható csak le. Én először az android appal játszottam (ajánlom mindenkinek, hogy előbb azt próbálja ki), és utána vettem csak meg a kártyás verziót.

Külön kiemelendő, hogy egy-egy party ritkán tart fél óránál tovább (de inkább 20 perc).

Nálam eddig ez a legkirályabb pakliépítő.

I have only the base game for this White Wizard game. That however does not diminish my enjoyment of it. The theme, space opera, is well executed. The gameplay is a mix of deck building and dueling, much like Ascension. Star Realms is a great gateway game and wonderful filler that you can pull out between rounds of the BIG nightly game. This game company, White Wizard Games, is on fire and if you have not tried their other games yet you are doing yourself a disservice. 8/10 Have game will travel! (OK, I mean I will bring this to EVERY game night of my playgroups.) Yes, it's that good.

What was I thinking?! Not only is this from the guy who designed Ascension, but comparisons to Ascension are everywhere...[i]and rate Ascension a 1.[/i] How could I be surprised when, playing this, I had a sense of deja vu, mindlessly acquiring green cards for a landslide victory in my first game. Then, in the second game, I helplessly watched as my opponent mindlessly acquired yellow cards for a blowout win. Where is the strategy? I'll admit there are probably nuances to card selection that I don't get in my first game, but there's an even greater gaping hole in the tactics for this game. Zero thought whatsoever is required in how to deploy your hand--you can pretty much toss it on the table all at once, assign damage, and then buy a new card or two.

It would be difficult for me to rate this game any lower.  This is mostly an app review, as I find deck builders to be very finicky in paper (especially this one with the authority management).

Puntos fuertes: El precio para la experiencia de juego. Muy entretenido, dinámico, rápido, muy bien ambientado y las ilustraciones muy cuidadas.

Puntos débiles: LA CAJA. Es un juego que DEBE ser enfundado, y no cabe en la caja. El marcador de puntuación con cartas puede ser un apaño, pero nosotros preferimos una APP. Después de muchas partidas echas en falta una expansión con variedad en las naves.

Conclusión: Este fue nuestro primer Deck Building para dos y nos encanta. Es fácil de sacar, aunque tiene su pequeño despliegue. En calidad-precio es un juegazo, que hace que desees comprar más expansiones. No hemos podido probar los eventos, pero sin duda le deben aportar mucha más emoción.

I'm disappointed by the unimaginative world-building--seriously, there's one faction called the Blob???--but it's sharp, fast, and full of agonizing choices. You don't want to dilute your deck with many disparate faction cards, but you still often need to grab cards from your opponent's factions to prevent them from getting too strong (or use the Blob's trade-row scrapping powers).

The price tag and physical size of the game vs the depth and replayability ratio is pretty damn amazing, incidentally. Best investment since Hanabi.

What Ascension should have been, and without all of its psychotic hippy artwork. Star Realms is very quick, easy to learn (especially for experienced gamers) and offers some tough choices. Between 2 reasonably experienced players, Star Realms is largely down to the luck of the first few hand draws. Most games are a tight rice but it is also prone to rapid blow out in results. Addictively good fun but don't take it too seriously.

My first deck builder and still one of my favs! The thing I like about star realms is that you are not mindlessly chasing victory points but relentlessly attacking the opponent. The factions and their combo powers are a great addition and encourage more planning when building your deck. The amount of game you get for your money is frankly incredible. Recommended!

Another Deck Building Game but this one is pretty great. Plays in really short time and has that Ascension feel albeit in space. What separates it though is the fact that you need to wipe out your enemy HQ to win so direct attacking is possible. 

From that point of view think MtG meets Ascension but without the collectible element. 

As well as acquiring ships, the players can also acquire Bases, some of which protect your HQ as they must be attacked first - these are called Outposts.

Bases are also valuable because they stay in play between turns and continue to offer their benefits. 

Like certain expansions for Ascension some cards gain additional benefits when like cards are played - this is called Alliances. With only 4 factions in the game to date some really powerful combos can be created. 

Star Realms is easy to learn, fast to play and a come from behind combo is always on the cards. Great stuff.

I've mostly played the iOS version, because the port is NICE & I usually don't get to play 2-player games so there's really no point in buying the card version (even though it's dirt cheap for such a cool game).
 
But it's so smooooooth. I've played the manual version once, but I think I like the iOS version better, because the AI deals with the scoring and the shuffling, making it even smoother & quicker. 

Anyway, very fast, addictive and fun to play. I played like 25 games the day I got it. Just blam blam blam.

Now I think I've overplayed the basic game, but 35 plays for that kind of money...

Update 5/29/16: This game continues to be one of my favorite 2 player games. My girlfriend and I play this at least twice a week on average.

Great 2 player game!  My girlfriend and I played it three times the day I bought it, and it was only $15!  This is the first deck building game I have played, and I now understand why people like this genre.  There are so many avenues to victory, and I find it both tense and exciting, while also making for a relaxing evening at home.

RATING: 8
Fast, quick and enjoyable deck builder, much more interactive than Dominion, but also lacking that game's massive variety.  The four factions play nicely enough, and the Crisis decks add in some extra factors.  Like Dominion, this is "like" rather than "love", but gets played often, and that's a good thing.

Star Realms has become my go to game. Played hundreds of games via the app already. Really do like the game that you can know the cards inside and out, but still have luck turn you on your head as you lose to a newbie. However, someone that knows the game well will still win over an inexperienced player a large proportion of the time. Really  have enjoyed the 3-4 player variety of the game too, though there is a little bit of a 'who will attack first' issue in Free For All play.
--------------
I rate this fairly low for a game that is in my top 5, but that is simply because I realize the limitations of the game and the design constraints that the model of publishing has created. I understand the huge swings of luck that can prevent you from winning. I understand that AT BEST you are playing a game of luck mitigation. BUT I just enjoy playing it and teaching it so much.
---------------
I don't know if it is guilt over having spent so much on the Frontiers kickstarter, but I have not played this at all since the kickstarter ended...including the app. I had been playing it almost constantly, and then it just lost my interest. Still really like the game, maybe I just got burned out on it for a bit.

The hallmarks of Star Realms and why it has earned a place on my shelf: very basic and quick deck builder, incredibly flexible and variable setup, balanced cards, and the very fun ally mechanism. It does all the things I want a solid deck builder to do, and in such a small and flexible package. This game replaced Dominion on my shelf as my gateway Deck Builder, and that's not a small compliment.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Elegantly simple deckbuilder that above all succedes in being a fast-dynamic experience that is easy to pick up and enjoy.

Basically a super-fast version of your typical deckbuilder with a constantly changing card pool, simple combo-driven mechanics and blazing fast player interaction. This is probably the best 1v1 deckbuilder out there.

As a downside you could argue that the art is somewhat lackluster (specially the card design/layout) and the theme is ridiculously pasted-on and irrelevant as in most of these types of games. Which is evidenced by the successive "X-Realms" re-themes that have been released so far.

At last, a deckbuilding game with Magic-style combat.  I like that the faction and base/outposts give you something to consider when buying cards other than simply taking the card with the highest cost.  I'll need a few more plays to get the feel for it.  The graphic design is a little chintzy.

RATING: 7
My girlfriend enjoys this one a lot.  I'm not that great a fan of space games or the artwork in this one, and it feels like this game just asks you to be as aggressive as you can be, hence The Blob cards being the most sought-after for their explosive power.

Still, it is enjoyable to make long hard-hitting combos, and it is a very cheap game, so for the moment it will see more plays.

Update:  The theme did nothing for me and I could not shake the feeling that it was too chaotic and random.  I opted to keep the Egyptian-themed Valley deckbuilders instead as my quick deckbuilder games.

RATING: 6
Good game considering the small price. 
It's portability still makes it a great option to bring along when travelling.
But when at home, having so many other good games to choose from (including Dominion and several of its expansions), it just won't see the table much, if at all.

Addictive. You always want to play another game, as it plays very fast. Nice theme. On top of a good game that in a weired way reminds med of Gin Rummy (but much cooler), I like the fact that you don't need to buy extra packs to improve the game. You can stick with the basic pack, and that's totally fine. So much game in a small package.

Gutes Deck Building Spiel mit einem netten Mechanismus: man muss den oder die Gegner um ihre Autoritätspunkte erleichtern. Das tut man mit Hilfe von Raumschiffen, die angreifen.

RATING: 6
A punchy little card game for 2 players that does deckbuilding well.  Star Realms understands the 2 main focuses of deckbuilding: Purchases that allow players to increase their hands size by drawing additional cards, and purchases that allow players to remove obsolete cards from their decks.

Fast, intuitive, artistically gorgeous, yet graphically easy to understand. Simple to introduce to new players and fun to play.

A word of warning: If, for some reason, you are having difficulty getting people to play SR, do not just get the App. Its not that the App is bad, on the contrary, you'll play the hell out of it and burn out on SR playing against the AI. The physical card game will just wind up gathering dust.

I will never, ever do this again. I got into board gaming to get away from the solitaire nature of video games, not to play them solo.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Yet something else that took what Ascension did and improved it. The bases are what really make this game. Choosing to have to attack them instead of the player makes for some good decisions and some tactical play. I give this one two thumbs up.

This is a great, simple and really quick deck builder to bring out in a pinch.  I don't particular care about the theme, but it's quick and easy to learn and play.  I like the ability to both purchase cards and attack the opponent, which gives it a little change from DC Deck builder, or some of the other deck builders.  While it's not exactly innovative, I do appreciate the ability to play the cards in any order; something that is different from other DB games where you have to be concerned with playing cards in the right order to get the benefit of some effects.

RATING: 7.4
Super small package, a lot of fun in a quick game. Reasons I didn't rate it higher:

-I prefer market based deckbuilders (Dominion) to river deckbuilders (Star Realms)
-Base game doesn't have tremendous depth/complexity, so after our first ~15 plays or so it started feeling a bit less exciting

EDIT: Downrated since I just haven't had any interest in playing recently.

Awesome lunch time game, it has jumped up from a 7 to an 8 for me in this context.  This game is fast, the ramp up phase you feel in most deckbuilders is almost nonexistent here and it gets you right in the action.  This takes the ascension mechanisms and strips them down to be a mean lean game.  No monsters clogging the center, no counting VPs at the end and lots of cool card synergies. Loving it so far.

And I think it's pretty much the same as Ascension. I like more the theme and the art of Star Realms and I found also refreshing to find some little new things here and there, but overall, it's pretty much the same experience. Probably the main difference (and the best improvement) is the interaction between the cards.

It's still too light for me, I don't think I would like to play it in a real table.

Could we finally have an Ascension killer in our midst? Sci fi always trumps fantasy for me and the direct conflict is a lot of fun, along with the different play modes.  The damage counters are kind of wonky, but that's easily fixed by using some other kind of counters.  Great stuff!

Gioco di carte che ricorda Dominion anche se pensato principalmente per due giocatori. Ad ogni turno si pescano 5 carte dal proprio mazzo che saranno giocate per: 1.acquistare altre carte, 2.infliggere punti ferita all'avversario. Gioco semplice e veloce dalla durata contenuta. Niente di innovativo ma gradevole e simpatico. Visto il successo sono uscite già diverse espansioni che al momento sono però reperibili solo in inglese mentre il base esiste anche in italiano grazie alla piccola casa editrice Devier.

This game is based on the type of deck building mechanics you see in games like Dominion. You start with a bunch of tame cards and buy from a central market and then attack your opponent. If you buy the same colour of cards, you get a bonus, and then you win or lose. 

This game could have used some serious editing and critical review prior to release. With a lack of inventiveness amongst the mechanics being matched by the lack of writing cleverness on the cards. For example, 'the blob' is the alien species and "the federation" are more human looking ships? That sort of derivative feel permeates the game and draws down any excitement I would have had about counting numbers on cards. 

This game also reminds me of several online card playing games where you attacked a castle based on random cards that were shuffled your way. If you were lucky enough to buy the blue ship in turn 1 and then find a blue base in turn 3, you will have activated the powers of that ship by pure chance. 

About the only mechanic I like about this game over Dominion is the market where cards are somewhat random. However, that idea has been used before in Machi Koro Harbor Expansion and other games.

Here's the thing: I like deck building games! This one just leaves me cold and numb counting yellow money an red attack symbols as if I was exposed to the harsh cold vacuum of space after my commander decides to scrap my perfectly good Explorer for +2 damage...

[i]This is actually a deck builder that I could get behind. It plays quick, doesn't necessarily rely on deck thinning and has awesome artwork. I am still on the fence as to whether or not I want to add this to my collection; I still would rather pull out Race for the Galaxy to get a quick card gaming fix. My biggest complaint is keeping track of your life total using dice or cards, it is very tedious. For now I will be content to play this game with my buddy Joel who loves this game.[/i]

Maybe it's the newness but I feel like this plays better than ascension. Then again could just be that the AI is harder. That doesn't always mean a better game could just be a swingier game.

I got "Star Realms" in February of 2015 after seeing it repeatedly on "Best Games of 2014" lists, and although I'm not big into card-building games, if I only owned one, this is it, as, once past the underwritten rules, it becomes an addictive adventure that manages to evoke its theme.

The rules sheet, a tri-fold, 3-panel color piece which unfortunately uses reverse white type, is underwritten, in that it lay out the rules but doesn't completely explain how the game is to be played. In that regard, the video by Gordon Werner is excellent for showing how to play: once I watched that I was able to go back to the printed rules sheet and make more sense of it. 

I also own the Fleets & Fortresses and Bases & a few other add-on sets, although one could get by on the base set, as within the original release there is much room for replayability. 

I'm a real sucker for space battle games and have own a few ("Light Speed" "Star Wars: Epic Duels," "Star Wars: X-Wing Fighther," "Star Borders--Humanity" "Space Station Assault," and "Mag Blast - 3rd Ed.") but this one feels like the most complete realization of the theme, especially with its relatively low level of complexity and how quickly one can play the cards to a decision. Repeated plays not only allows one to speed up one's play, it lets the inherent brilliance of the card interactions shine through.  Simply put, once you have the rules down, it's just plain fun to play.

牌推分成四種陣營
藍色主要是購買能力加強跟補寫
紅色主要是把牌移出遊戲來壓縮牌庫，有張8防的base應該算是遊戲最強牌
黃色特色是棄對方手牌，一張四防的濾牌base也蠻強的
綠色主要就是數據都特別大，不論是買或攻擊或抽牌能力
策略面主要是看一開始中央牌庫狀況分析，能的話進量購買同種顏色牌
但是有強牌也是要優先購買
因為有移出遊戲加強能力的牌是使用上策略最大的地方
其它就剩下抽牌的運氣了
規則:
DBG 抽五張
base可一直保留

I absolutely love this game.  Game play is very easy to learn and follows the strategy of most deck-building games.  My kids (ages 10-16) had no problems picking it up, and they love to play the game against me. I also have the Android game, and at any time I'll have 15 games going.  Quick turns, even as you think through the moves. 

There's more than just "get rid of the cheap cards" (although that's a key piece) to the strategy as similar types of cards leverage each other.  With the right hand you can absolutely devastate an opponent, although it takes several turns before you can get that far.

The downside for me is the general same one - the luck of the draw can play a deciding factor in winning or losing.

RATING: 7
It's a nice two player deckbuilder, with the traditional two currency format - gold for buying new cards from the shared draft (Legendary/Ascension style) and attack value. Instead of killing monsters, you're inflicting damage directly on your opponent. All the same pros and cons of Ascension ... getting lucky on whether synergistic cards are available to buy helps a lot, as does deck thinners. I mark it down a little because of the simplicity of the direct conflict (there's one less decision point on what to attack each turn) but others will mark it higher for that. It's fast, the rules are easy. The pool of available cards is probably a little limited for extensive replay, but I'm sure that the inevitable expansions will fix that.

"This is an odd one, because I have probably played Star Realms 500 times on my phone. I really enjoy it there, because it is quick, but meaty, and I can either play the co-op scenario or just beat up on the AI. 

In real life, fiddling with cards makes the game take longer. I don't enjoy fighting against a human, and although I appreciate that there is a co-op mode, it's not great. 

So as a phone app, it's an 8 or 9. As an analog game in its normal competitive mode, it's a 4. Analog co-op probably gets a 6."

When I played Race for the Galaxy (against the AI) 500 times, I enjoyed it less and less, and ended up quite disliking the game. With Star Realms, it has held up very well to 500 plays against the AI, and if anything I enjoy it a bit more now than when I started.

Bought this off of an enthusiastic recommendation at my LGS and so far my only regret is not picking up two more decks. By far my favorite deck builder.  The level of player interaction is a refreshing change from the solitaire race that so many of these games turn into.

The rules are simple, the games quick and tactical, the art cool, the box cheap (when you can find it) and portable.  Looking forward to seeing where they take this game with future expansions.

A favorite of mine as an introduction to deck building. The small deck and short turns really give you a chance to customize a deck, the possibility for combos presents an opportunity for an epic win and the limited (and random) offering makes this game a lot easier in the beginning, reducing cognitive load and play time. And it's super fun! I really enjoy it. I've only played it 2 player, which seems like a context where it shines.

Based on one play: A deck builder with 5 cards available to buy at all times, which are shared between the players and just refilled as bought. Use your money cards to buy them and then mainly use them to attack the opponent (or his ships) and his bases. Kill the opponent to win. It works fairly well and since the cards are shared and visible it is easy to figure out what to do without being at too much of a disadvantage to someone who has played before.

Probably the only deck building game I would choose to play.  Not a big fan of the mechanic, but this game was fun and quick for a few plays.  Then the typical issues I have with deck building started creeping in. The main downside for me is that the starting hand is just so dull. I realize that the purpose of the game is to build an awesome deck as the game progresses, but those boring initial 10 cards prevents me from wanting to start the game. With Star Realms, even the "cool" cards seem to lose their luster rather quickly.  Luck of the draw in this system can be frustrating when you purchase a mediocre card exposing an awesome card for your opponent.  Lucky shuffles can also result in 20+ or even 30+ plus hit point rounds that are just impossible to defend.  From now on, I will just play Race instead.

Good way to kill time with the wife. Haven't tried any of the 3+ player variants as they just don't seem that interesting, especially compared to the other games that we could be playing.

Quick setup, quick play, interesting theme, good art, all make for an enjoyable game.

I like the expansions (Colony Wars) that add new ships, but not a fan of the leaders or the events or some of the more off the wall additions.

It's been downgraded a bit as it seems like it plays itself.

I originally rated this game a 7.  Further play has soured me even more; I feel like the variable center row is just fundamentally less engaging and interesting than Dominion-style "see them all at once."  I don't think it's a bad game, per se, I just don't think it's all that brilliant either.  That said, it's come along on more trips than any of my other deckbuilders due to its convenient size.

What a fantastic and simple game. It takes about 2 minutes to learn the basics, but you'll develop more strategies over time. The iOS app is a lot of fun, but I prefer playing with another person using the cards.

Oct 2014: in the last two months, have played the online version over 350 times. The face-to-face version, 3 times. I enjoy both versions, but the online is probably the best way to play it. I highly recommend either version, it's worth trying if you are a hobby gamer, and it's cheap enough that you can buy copies and give them as gifts.

Have played the iOS version over 500 times as of November, 2014. Enjoy the physical version, but iOS is so much faster, it's hard to be patient with all the shuffling. Great game. I rate this an 8, although I am currently VERY addicted to the iOS version (which has to be a 10). Not sure how long it will last... if they come out with expansions for iOS or more organized tournaments using the App... I am in trouble. As it is, I am playing in Remy Gibson's league here on BGG and it is a hoot.

Completely overhyped. Not nearly as good as Ascension. The only major thing this game has going for it is the $15 price point. Yes, it's got a cool theme, but I found Ascension to be far more involved and interesting.

Holy derivative, Batman! People pile onto Cryptozoic for rereleasing Dominion and Ascension over and over again, yet this game is lauded for doing the exact same thing?! 

This game is pretty much exactly Ascension. There are no qualifiers to that statement, no ifs, no ands, no buts. It's Ascension with flavorless artwork that bores while it bores. If Ascension and its 8 billion copies didn't already exist then this would be an okay game. As it stands there is no reason to play this more than once.

This game is so amazing! It combines everything I love from Dominion with almost everything I love from Magic. Setting up a combo, while racing each other to 0 life. It is VERY balanced and it's fun to figure out a counter against all the variations your opponent is getting. Sometimes the luck of the 'draw' can be a bit of a setback, but I don't care. Games don't last long and you just play another one right after. I can play a marathon with this game, that's how much I love it.

edit: overplayed. Needs an expansion that shakes things up, instead of just adding more variety.

This game was an unexpected hit with my girlfriend. I thought she didn't like scifi, but she looks past the theme and enjoys the gameplay a lot. She always tends to get the "Target opponenent discards a card" Star Empire cards! Each game is different. Making decisions and combining cards and developing a strategy as you play is SO FUN. Each game is so different. At first you might think you're going for Blobs only ... but then no more show up. So you buy some Machine Cult and then all there is is Trade Federation and Star Empire for several turns! Love this game. It's interesting how some cards that pop up in the Trade Row become "must-haves" and each player gasps and scrambles for them. Favourite card: Stealth Needle. 
Favourite faction combo: Blob/Trade Federation. Thematically, it feels like "The Trade Federation has had problems with the Blobs for at least 150 years, starting with the great Vorlon Uprising, and lasting to only a few decades ago. Recently, The Blobs have relented in their isolation and border protection, allowing safe passage through their domain to the Machine Cult territory beyond - in exchange for early Trade Federation technology."

Star Realms was apparently the hotness of Origins 2014, and I can see why. Anyone who has played Ascension (or many other standard deck-builders) can learn this in about 12.7 seconds. It features head-to-head play, which makes it much more interactive than most of its predecessors. That’s a good thing, as a player must be constantly mindful of what her opponent is up to. 

I think no one would argue that the game has much depth. Strategies are very straightforward generally, and the game is mostly tactical. Even though, it plays in twenty minutes and there are enough interesting decisions during that time to hold my attention. And at 15 bucks retail, the game is a great buy. I wish the card quality was a bit better (I love me some linen finish), and despite what I’ve heard several reviewers say, the artwork is just average to me. Nevertheless, I can see this getting a lot of plays down the road. I’m sure it will be endlessly expanded, but I’m not sure I need additional content for now.

RATING: 6
It feels like Dominion base set - but in space & with battle damage.

The first few rounds are back and forth, clawing for something with good hit points or purchase value and discarding low-value cards to build a lean & powerful deck. But within 5 or 6 exchanges, the action kicks in and its a great little engine builder. Actually, I prefer it to base Dominion because the battle is so interactive that it never feels like two-player solitaire. 

I can't think of a better quick deck-builder filler. First time we played it, we played three times. 

Downsides /Caveats: The rule book can be a little vague in that it doesn't call out some things specifically, such as the difference between "played" and "in play" which affects, for instance, the timing of bonus effects and when the primary effects of bases & battle-stations kick in, and whether cards drawn as the result of a primary or bonus action can be immediately placed into play and affect other cards already played. Much of the action in later rounds of play hinges on concatenating bonuses from bases & outposts previously put into play, as well as primary and bonus actions from in-hand cards that allow drawing / discarding / trashing cards. Sometimes the difference between hitting for 8 damage or 18 damage depends on how you interpret the timing of the card interactions. If there's an exhaustive rules guide - please point me at it. :-)

Fun at first, simple to learn and teach, gets old after a while. Able to go to 4 players by using sleeves and red and black playing cards. We like to not play with event cards, which severely shift the balance of the game by making it more random who gets rewarded for the random events.

I've only played the iOS version so far but it's a solid game; kind of a combination of MTG and Dominion. It's much easier for new gamers to pick on this as compared to MTG and much of the same strategy is there but I like that both players start on even ground and build up to unique decks as the game goes on. Overall, a pretty solid game to pull out and play.

Star realms is a fun and very well balanced 2 player deckbuilding game where players draft from a center array of cards that refills when a player buys a card. There are cards belonging to different factions, which combo with each other in interesting ways. The wonderful thing is you can't win by building just one color. There are a number of different interesting strategies and combinations you can make.

:star: Art, Iconography and components functional
:star: Clever or interesting mechanisms
:star: Reasonably low downtime between turns with mildly AP players
:star: Multiple plays stay interesting
:star: Low or mitigatable luck elements

Fast, ruthless deck building.  Can be a little runaway-ish if the cards don't go your way, but it is over quick enough that you can give it another try if you lose.  That's cool.
For those who complain about the card-based score system: I found this the most innovative idea I've seen in some time.  Sure, it isn't easy if basic arithmetic isn't your bag, but for me...wouldn't do it any other way.  And would like to see more of it in other games.

A decent deckbuilder, but it feels a bit too random and swingy. When I won it didn't feel like it was because I played particularly well, and when I lost I couldn't tell what I could have done to win. Maybe it would be clearer after memorizing most of the cards, but it just doesn't seem worth the effort. I'd rather play other deckbuilders, like Dominion or Legendary Encounters.
Note: I have only played the app version, not the physical card game version. As far as I know, all the rules are the same.

Just an awesome little deckbuilder. For more strategy, I recommend separating it out by colors into 4 piles, in a column. Then, deal out 4 cards from each color's trade row, and voila! Now you've got 16 cards to choose from, and you can always get the color you need. Throw in Merc Cruisers alongside the Explorers, and now you've got yourself a modified, grown-up DB game. Enjoy!

Fast, fun, and simple deckbuilder. Few rules, but very streamlined and intuitive. The artwork and gameplay are just amazing. Its small size means it's also really portable, which means it will see a lot of plays. I don't know if it will get same-y after may repeated plays since there is no variable setup, unlike Dominion. Maybe some expansions and/or Colony Wars will fix that.

I also love the abilities from when you have multiple cards of each faction.

It feels like Ascension but only 2-player and versus, and it feels like a real step backwards, as it's essentially just a deckbuilding version of MtG with a little less complexity, with all the mechanics stolen from Ascension (and a few other deckbuilders which also have stolen from Ascension). Overall an okay game, but I don't quite see the hype. But more compact than Ascension, and Ascension is probably the best deckbuilder I've played in terms of mechanics (despite it's possibility of broken combos), but Legendary Encounters is currently my absolute favorite deckbuilder.

But, if you have twenty minutes to burn, this deckbuilder will get you in and out fast.

 I got this on my iPhone months ago, thought it was ok but not compelling. Then I saw the Flying Solo video of a solitaire version on YouTube, went out and bought a deck and found the pdf for the "Replicators" on BBG, then I was hooked and started looking for more solo scenarios. Had fun playing Shaun Gamers' solo variants for a while, then my interest waned, now I've moved on to other games. I guess I'm just not a big deck builder fan, I'm not sure why.

Only played the free iOS version a few times (basic campaign and some games against easy AI), so I'll refrain from rating this for now. Seems like a fun and fast filler that's very similar to Ascension. I like the artwork. I have some doubts about game balance and long term appeal, first impression is that some cards seem undercosted. But a fun game so far. Don't plan to get the full version of the app, but would like to buy the physical game some time, to play with my wife.

Getting the free version of the app is highly recommended, gives you the opportunity to find out if it is for you.

EDIT 09-17-2015: Have the physical version by now, and have played it a few times (plus many more plays of the iOS version). I find this to be an excellent little game. Great fun, high replayability, very small footprint.

RATING: 6
I like the simplicity of this deckbuilder.  I like that the game plays quickly, and I think the art on the cards is very well done.  My wife really enjoys this game.  My biggest gripe, however, is that I feel like it is almost entirely based on luck.  Luck of the draw with the cards in your hand, the luck of when a powerful, high value card becomes available for purchase in relation to when you have several credits to spend, and luck of whether or not more cards of the same faction will become available for purchase on your subsequent turns. There have been a few games that I have played that came down to the wire, but the majority of the games are determined very early on based on which player is able to obtain the most powerful cards in the beginning of the game.

Ugly, hugely imbalanced and luck dependant.

You rely so much of the availability of cards in the TR that a bad TR usually means the death of you, as the game is so fast that you won't have time to recover.

The luck of the draw is such a huge factor, thanks to the ally abilities, that not being able to pull them kills you. Actually, everything kills you.

Makes the game no fun at all.

I tried multiple time making exactly the same turn as my opponent, and ended up dying in three turns because they could get the ally and I couldn't. Woohoo, right?

Overrated at best. Flawed. Not worth the time or investment.

Star Realms is a well designed game... but lacks the spark that makes me want to bring it to the table.
As far as deck-builders go, this is a good one.   It's simple, streamlined, fits in your pocket, and is well balanced.  
And yet... it just isn't very exciting.  You'll never be on the edge of your seat, or spend nights thinking about new strategies to try next time.  There are never difficult decisions to make, and there is always a most optimal way to spend the resources you draw.   It kind of just plays itself in a way.

If you're looking for a good deck-builder, you won't be disappointed.
If you're looking for a great deck-builder, go track down Arctic Scavengers.

There is not another game that I have played more than Star Realms. This game takes about 17 minutes. You can't beat that when the theme and mechanics make you feel like it is more than just your normal filler. There is some definite strategy, and when those combos come out; you feel super smart. Great times for such a small game. This is a go to for me and my wife. One of the most basic deckbuilders there is; but in my opinion this one is better than most of the more complex ones. The team play is great too. However, this rating is surely based on length of game. If Star Realms took 35 minutes or longer per game, it would be a no go. This game fits the perfect time frame for what it is offering. *** Wife:8.5

To be honest, I don't understand the phenomenon of "Star Realms". After several live & a few more online plays I can say that for me, this is a better application than it is a game... During live play, some of the undeniably great thins (speed of play mainly) are simply gone. Instead of blazing fast gameplay, all you get is a lot of tedious counting, especially in the later phases. And the decisions? Not too many. Buying one or two cards out of five is not that exciting, rest of the turn is pretty much played on an autopilot. After initial excitement I don't enjoy it anymore, so for me it's as good as gone.

Las dos primeras partidas me dieron la sensación de que el juego era un poco guiado y que no habia apenas toma de decisiones, pero con las siguientes partidas voy dándome cuanta que tiene algo mas, hay mas decisiones que tomar, a la hora de escoger cartas de que facción para hacer combos, si coger cartas para "limpiar" tu mazo, el orden de juego de tu mano, seleccionar las habilidades "esta o esta", etc....

Es un juego en el que no hay que darle mucho al coco y que se juega en 20 minutos.

What sets Star Realms apart from any other "Cerberus Engine" card game is that it supports many different types of play. Teams, Free-for-All, Emperor, Full Cooperative, etc. I'm a big fan of the starship battle sci-fi theme as well. In fact, the only thing I don't really like about Star Realms is the amount of setup required when playing with different player counts. I'm sure I could keep all three of my decks combined and it wouldn't hurt the balance too much, but my OCD just won't allow it. Still,I love that players can choose how many core decks they want to purchase instead of just getting one 6-Player set. Star Realms is just a very gamer savvy game.

What a great deck builder that you can get for cheap!  I think I payed a little over ten bucks for this and it's a great quick two player game.  The art is fantastic and the game is surprisingly deep yet straightforward.  My sons have taken a liking to it and want to play all the time (one of them spending his own money on the iOS version so he can practice against the AI.

Four factions each with its own feel add diversity and I really like the ship versus outpost decisions.  I have learned (via the AI on the iOS) that I seem to stink at playing he game - but I have a lot of fun.  Since all the human opponents I play are similarly bad, we have a lot of close fun battles that are quick enough to play the oft demanded rematch.

Great 2P deck builder.  Less set-up than Dominion since you don't put out 10 small decks, you just lay out 5 cards from one big deck that both players can buy from.

The goal of the game is more intuitive (and thematic) than Dominion:  Kill your opponent (not sure why they used the word "authority").

On your turn you use your cards to either "buy" or "heal" or "attack".

The free app is very well done and absolutely addicting.  If I tracked the number of plays I had on the app, I would be embarrassed to provide the number because it would be so big.  :)

Star Realms is basically Ascension with an expansion. It's a lot of fun, don't get me wrong. And I like deck building. But Dominion is a much better game. I like how quickly Star Realms moves but having no limit on buys. I also like the bases and the factions that work together to give each other special powers. I personally think Dominion is the better deck building, then Ascension, then Star Realms.

I enjoy Hero Realms a great deal more than Star Realms, but I'm a fan of both.  The app version of this game has completely replaced the physical version for me - though I still like to play Hero Realms the most.  :)

I think this game would be great IF luck wasn't so important - especially in the first few rounds. If your opponent draws ships that are especially useful very early in the game (Freighter, Trade Pod, strong card-scrappers etc) and you don't, your chance of winning plummets. And that happens frequently.

A quick read of the forum suggests that the best-ranked Star Realms players win maybe fewer than two-thirds of their games, despite playing a wide range of opponents. This supports the idea that luck is a big factor.

The 'Gambits' expansion makes that problem worse. It gives players two random one-use special abilities, some of which help lucky players to acquire heavy-hitting, expensive cards very early in the game - giving them a big advantage.

The other problem is that the huge synergy between certain kinds of cards can make decisions about what to acquire/play quite obvious. So you might find the game both fiddly and like it is 'playing itself'. I often end the game and feel like a lucky early start decided the win, not good play.

That's a shame because the rest of the game has a good flow. Elements like bases, synergy and card-scrapping perhaps work better here than in its competitor Ascension. 

It is enjoyable trying to choose the best time to switch from growing your economy to bringing the enemy down. You can't leave it too late. If your opponent immediately has a good economic start, you might try to go all-out-attack from the beginning before they expand too much ... as long as the right ships are available (a few cheap Blob fighters get the ball rolling). That's the real fun of the game.

I grew up watching my cousins play Magic, and while it was fun to watch, I was turned off by the idea of having to invest so much effort into building the perfect deck. So I had to be persuaded into  a deck-building game like Star Realms, but it totally won me over.

Easy instructions to get started quickly.  There is a Youtube video online from one of the developers demoing on the upcoming tablet version.  There are several different game modes besides PvP that allow for variety to keep the game interesting.  There is even a couple of cards that give Co-Op and Solo options.

Everything you need comes in the single desk. I see definitely see the possibility of expansions later on.

Have played this one a LOT online especially. Thought it wouldn't be as fun as a card game but it was. Really enjoy this one.
Update: Played it as a card game and I find that to be more fun actually. I find I think more of what cards to choose.

Played this one a LOT, and now have the wife addicted to it. This game is crazy addicting once you feel comfortable with it. I def play the online version the most. But now play with the cards a lot with the wife. Def one of our favorites!

UPDATE: This is the game in my collection that gets the most play, mainly via the online version. And now that Im in that league on BGG, fun is still very strong.

RATING: 7.9
This is an interesting deck building game where you are building fleets each turn and setting up star bases.  A great concept for a deck building mechanic and work well thematically.  it really feels like you are building a fleet and defending a mother base. the cards interact well and there seems to be decent balance between factions. However,  I really want to like this game and I really do but I have real concerns of run-away wins.  We played it four times in a row and none of the game were close.  The game can be  viscous a times so when you get caught in the whirlwind of defeat it can be off putting.   The one good thing is that the games are quick (30 minutes or less).  I like the game but I'm just hoping for a little more of a back and forth boxing match rather than a race for total domination.

This is My absolute favorite deck-building game. The synergy between the factions is interesting and complex. I feel this game takes more thought then a lot of people are willing to give it credit for. I personally feel that the Blob faction is over powered and I choose to not buy them when they become available and press my luck playing the other 3 factions.

Brisk and engaging deck-builder. Bases, card bonus effects, and the ability to attack right off the hop are nice features.

For a game where you shuffle the cards [i]all the time[/i], the cards aren't particularly well-built for shuffling.  They stick together a lot.

For me, one of the best value deck builders available. Whether on the iPad or using the cards, this game scratches my deck building itch.  The quick setup just helps.

Nov '16 Update - not played this for a while and have gone a bit further down the deck building rabbit hole such as Game of Thrones LCG & Arkham Horror LCG which provides greater depth and challenges.
Still a great game, but as a gateway game into deck building.

RATING: 9
My wife and I are often on the lookout for very portable two player games with a large amount of replay value. Star Realms seems to fit that bill quite well. We picked it up four days ago and have played about eight games since then. We've played a lot of Ascension, so the deckbuilding style of play and many of the mechanics were easy to learn. The game is a lot of fun, and as each game progresses into the mid-to-late game, there tend to be a lot of big punches and swings. It can be fun to see all your different allied cards triggering off of each other, enabling you to put together a very powerful turn. It's still early days, so I imagine it could be possible that at a certain point some particularly strong strategies or cards might make for repetitive experiences. But as of now, I'd say that it has a high replay value, and hard to beat for its price, fun, and portability.

RATING: 4
Ascension quicker without any sense of restraint. Rapid ramp, rapid buying, but one lucky 6-8 cost buy of the one or two good cards on offer makes the game trivial, not to mention the inverse where the good hand that offers 6-8 coin can offer 18-35 attack easily... and you have 50 hp.

Art is cool but does not strike. Most cards look like shapeless technoblobs. You don't SEE a great card just from the art.

Where does this game fit? As a 2p sci-fi versus game, Race just blows it away easily. As a 2p deckbuilder, it is quicker than Ascension but has far less interesting interactions and abilities... which is saying a lot because Ascension can be a chore. On Iphone, Ascension's slowness is mitigated and has a far better interface and easier to read cards.

Después de más de 80 partidas aún ofrece partidas diferentes y entretenidas. Hay azar sí, y puede ser determinante a la hora de ganar o perder una partida, pero al final ganará más partidas el que sepa jugar mejor. Hay ciertas decisiones que son automáticas (cartas que si salen las compras sí o sí), pero hay varios factores a tener en cuenta a la hora de comprar una carta u otra: las cartas del mercado, las de tu mazo, las de tu contrincante, el momento de la partida, la duración que pueda tener (a veces se alarga mas o menos y eso tiene sus consecuencias), etc. Un juego de confrontación, táctico, rápido, entretenido y con una toma de decisiones que no te freirá el cerebro pero que se ajusta muy bien al tipo de juego que es.

RATING: 6
the good:  gorgeous artwork, interesting mechanics, fast play, solid implementation of deck-building, converts well to digital app

the bad:
Once the game gets going, the bame is balanced.  But there is a huge amount of luck in what cards you manage to get very early, which can create one-sided snowballs.

Without any expansion, the game can get a bit repetitive.  After a while, you recognize the viable strategies and executing a strategy feels the same every time.  Seeing blob-based decks work yet again is not interesting or enriched by context.

Getting locked out by a discard deck, base-destroyer deck, or simply being run over when nothing good is available on your turn can sour the game pretty quickly.

the main interaction is destruction fo bases, but there isn't actually much choice there.  You should almost always destroy based when your hand allows, so that point of interaction becomes random rather than reactive.

as a two player tabletop game: 5/10
as a one player digital app: 7/10

It's a simple and interesting deck builder.  Can be picked up quickly but I'm not sure if there's anything really special here over other similar deck builders.

25-03-2015. I've currently played the card game 26 times, and have played the app a couple times more. I still feel the same, I am a bit burned out on Star Realms. I think the game is incredibly good, but I just don't want to play it anymore. I downgraded the rating from a 9 to a 7. I think the game is good and I'll play when I'm in the mood. I recognize the quality, although apparently I haven't developed the skill to be more than an average player.

29-10-2014. I've played the cardgame 23 times and currently own all expansions for the game. I still really like it, but I got a bit burned out on the game online (300-400 plays). I think I overplayed the game a little and I became tired of my win/loss ratio which never seemed to go much over 50/50. Playing a couple of games an evening with my hardcopy will now be the way I will play Star Realms.

19-08-2014. Played it more than 100 times the last few days on the PC against human opponents online. I still love it.

21-06-2014. Rated after 4 plays. I love this game. It reminds me of Ascension, but with a 1 vs 1 impementation. Game plays quickly, about 20-30 minutes per game.

You buy cards, which allow you to deal direct damage or increase your spending. Cards interact in really neat ways.

This game has temporarily replaced Dominion for us. A deck building game where you have about six cards to pick from that change from turn to turn. The key is to pick up certain cards that work well with certain cards. The player who does this the best will win the game. An easy game to fall in love with. Very smooth rules and teachable to new players. As far as deck building games, this is the one to introduce first.

Only played free iOS version, so the AI is super-easy, but I'm not seeing the fun here.  You don't have the pre-game strategizing like in Dominion of seeing all the cards that are available and deciding what combos to try for - you just try to string together the best combos as they come along, and the decisions are pretty automatic.  And without the something like the dynamic of "VP cards help me win but just fill up my hand during the game," it doesn't feel like a deck-builder to me.    I'm also biased - 2-player-only games have a huge hurdle to jump.

At its core a very basic game that is easy to pick up and teach. A PvP deck drafting game is rare enough! And to find one for such a cheap price and in a portable container is a steal!

Great deck-builder that's quick and easy to teach. Green is overpowered but that hasn't significantly hampered my enjoyment of the game. The trading faction has limited usefulness and red is only useful in the beginning to thin the deck. Long-term, the game is limited without any expansions.

An awesome little 2-player deckbuilder that streamlines and improves on the Ascension system.  Instead of maximizing endgame points, players are directly attacking each other, trying to reduce their opponent's life (Authority) to zero.  Think Ascension meets Magic the Gathering.  

Star Realms adds a lot of little tweaks to the gameplay that makes it really shine as a deckbuilder.  Many cards have Ally abilities, which allows multiple cards from the same faction to chain together to get bonus effects, rewarding a thematic, culled deck.  Other cards have Scrap abilities, in which permanently discarding them leads to other bonuses.  This results in some interesting gameplay decisions, as you determine how long to hang onto certain cards, or gain their bonuses while culling them.  

Another great introduction is the Bases, cards that stay in play until they are destroyed, and grant their own ongoing effects, or can support their faction with Ally abilities.  Some of these Bases are Outposts, which must be destroyed before Authority can be diminished.  These are a great element to the game, and allow for different strategies.  

The factions are interesting and feel different from each other, whether you try to make an efficient deck with the Machine Cult, reduce your opponent's hand while increasing your own with the Star Empire, or choose all-out warfare with The Blob.  The artwork is great and evocative of the sci-fi theme.

All of this gameplay comes in a tiny deck box with about 100 cards.  This is a super fun game, plays very quickly (about 20 minutes), and allows for both deckbuilding and direct player interaction (through combat!).  I can't wait to play this some more, top marks.  Also looking forward to the expansions.

I found playing the electronic version very addictive. AS deck-builders went, it felt like one of the better ones. Face to face was OK, but I increasingly got the feeling that the pool of cards you have on your turn to choose from had a too large role in determining victory. The game came to feel a tad repetative. The small expansions I tried in the elctronic version didn't seem to add much. As a filler, though, the game certainly has its place. It is certainly more than worth it's small price, as the initial exploration of the system is very enjoyable.

:thumbsup: Usually available at a very decent price point.

:thumbsdown: Expansion packaging mimics the booster packs used in CCG's. This is a bit misleading, as they're not random at all... I don't really like this, but it's a minor gripe.

Started out playing it on a tablet, which my son (age 7) really enjoyed - so picked up a copy at the UK Games Expo, and the physical game is going down even better. I enjoy this, he loves it - and he beats me a lot. Plenty of luck in the draw, but what I really like over Ascension (to which it owes an awful lot in design terms) is that cards aren't worth points themselves - so there's no disincentive to trim your deck. Can't argue with the price, or the convenience - wish more games followed the example for packaging and pricing.

Deckbuilding game so it's immediately compared with Dominion. For better or worse it is more luck-based than Dominion. That can be a disadvantage for people that play games to win, and an advantage for people that play games to have fun. People that call it 99% luck are just overreacting. 
Other than that it is much more interesting. The added value of same faction cards when you get them comboed diffentiates  and takes this game one or two steps ahead of Dominion. Random draws that gives the enhanced luck aspect also gives it great replayability.
I have played is Android free version vs AI over 100 times and never got bored. I liked this game a lot and prefer it over Dominion.

Minimalistic deckbuilder set in a science fiction outer space. Two stellar fleets fight for supremacy. Precisely, direct confrontation is the main attraction, or flaw, of the game, depending of your point of view. In fact, it is more explicit than in Nightfall, because in this later game the reverse chain reaction distracts from the main objective, giving other things to think about. It can be compared with Ascension, as they share a designer and there are some similar mechanics.

Boy, was I wrong about this game. My initial rating was 2/5, which raised to 3/5 and now hit 4/5. I suspect my distaste for deckbuilding games caused it, but after repeated plays, this game is DEEP. I've played dozens of games and have yet to figure out, or even suspect any kind of dominant strategy that games like Ascension suffer from. I'm writing this about only the base game, I'm sure as time passes many expansions will be released, but trust me, buy the base game and give it some table-time first, because it's very good.

Maybe I'm jaded from all of the games of Ascension that I've played, but this one falls a little flat for me.  Not sure if it's the fact that all of the cards look samey to me or what.  I'd probably like it more if I had never played Ascension.  As things are, I'm glad I played this before making a hype-buy.

After playing Cthulhu Realms, I appreciate this a little more, though CR is still preferable to me.

I found that there is little an opponent can do if you gather as much of blue cards as possible. Hard to win when one gathers lots of money, heals themselves and attacks all at once. I'm starting to lose interest because of that...

Structured very closely to the Ascension series, Star Realms attempts to carve its niche with cards which do more for less, and a more streamlined objective of taking your opponent down. For the most part this works in Star Realms' favour, as the game feels faster paced and simpler to approach. The game can escalate very quickly in power though, and poor luck or choices early in the game can quickly snowball. Also, Star Realms leaves little room for clever card play, but expansions should fix that shortly. In the end though, Star Realms and Ascension tread the similar line of being games that straddle between managing the chaos of luck and making worthwhile decisions.

Unlike Ascension, Star Realms is a strictly 2P game right out of the box. This doesn't really pose a problem, since I always thought Ascension plays best with 2P anyway. I have yet to try Star Realms as a multiplayer game, and don't intend to any time soon.

I was unimpressed with this one upon first play- perhaps it was just too overhyped. But as we played more, it started to grow on me. Then, I picked up the app and thoroughly enjoyed playing through the campaign and have played against the bot hundreds of times. Deckbuilding is the integral mechanic to this quick, hard-hitting game. I really feel the need to consider each one of my purchases- will this card work well with my deck or just be in the way? It takes a little bit to get your feet off the ground, but eventually you can build up some satisfying combos. And a complete game only takes about 20 minutes! It's pure genius.

I'm fairly certain I have hundreds of plays at this point (all on the android app). At first it seemed fairly random, because while I would usually lose, I would get crushing victories 20-30% of the time. It seemed to me that any game that let someone as bad as I was to win that decisively necessarily involved quite a bit of luck.

Now that I've gotten quite a bit better, it seems fairly random. Although I usually win, I still get crushed 20-30% of the time -- through no fault of my own, obviously ;-)

RATING: 5
Can't really understand the overall top ratings. I'm a big fan of Ascension BUT I don't like Star Realms! (which seems unlikely) I played it for 50+ games (digital version), but it never really got me hooked. For me the differences are frustrating:
-Bases/Outposts (like the Constructs in Ascension) have normally a short durability so I'm getting no engine-building feeling (growing stronger is more fun!)
-a lot more dependency of card drawing luck (in Ascension combining different 'colors'->Factions is not a bad thing)
-cards don't give you VPs so there is no need for buying cards at the end and only hoping for a good draw to smash the opponent
-the game could end unexpected because your opponent with a worse deck has a perfect draw -> lower control
-don't like the trashing function of cards, I don't want to trash good cards (especially expensive Bases/Outposts; why there is no discard-function instead?)
-you cannot beat some campain-games without a perfect card display (no fun!)
Overall I have no feeling of controlling the game even if I win. I stay with Ascension and Dominion for sure. A bit sad, I wanted to like Star Realms. :(

Great game. Fast, fun, most decisions are obvious, but it has just the right amount of decision making. 
The illustrations are quite nice too look at, if a bit dark. The different factions and their unique abilities make it possible to play a focused deck, but it is not necessary. Random distribution means of cards that there is no killer combo strategy, which makes for an interesting change of pace. I find this to be right in between Ascension, which is much more chaotic, and Dominion, which is muss less chaotic.
In only a few weeks of time, this became one of my most played games ever.

I have pretty much given up true board gaming in the last year or two. This game may be one of the causes. Every night I have friends over we just play this all night. There are so many ways to make this game work for you. If you used to be a Magic player this game will be for you. It's simple enough to teach new people, but the politics of a 4-player FFA game are unparalleled. I cannot recommend this game and its expansions enough.

0 újdonságot tartalmazó Dominion, Ascension keverék, aminél egyértelműen az volt a tervező célja, hogy minél egyszerűbb és olcsóbb játékot alkosson. Egy kis dobozban csak kártyákat kapunk, helytakarékos. A játék rendkívül egyszerű, hajókat vagy bázisokat tudunk venni a kezdő kártyákból, amelyek vagy pénzt vagy támadást adnak, esetleg gyógyulást. Annyi a cél, hogy az ellenfél 50 életét 0-ra csökkentsük. Középről vásárolunk, öt felcsapott kártyából. A játék akár 10 perc alatt is vége, de 30 percnél csak extrém esetben lehet több véleményem szerint. Könnyű, gyorsan elmondható szabály, kis helyigény. Tetszett, negatívum csak a szerencse szerep lehet, de egy jó kis 7-est megér simán. Mivel nem kedvelem a deckbuilder játékokat, ha egyet mégis kellene vennem az ilyen típusúakból, akkor ezt választanám.

Egyre jobban tetszik, én már az alapjátékban is rengeteg játékot érzek és az se elhanyagolható, hogy fele annyiba kerül, mint más ilyen játékok. Egy pontot emelek is. 7->8

In a world glut with deck builders, Star Realms has firmly carved out it's niche as the go-to quick filler deck builder. While I would never plan an night of Star Realms, it's definitely on the top of the list of games I'd look to if I needed to fill a 15-20 minute span.

The mechanics are very similar to say, DC Deckbuilder or Ascension, but Star Realms fits them into a small, tactical, fun little package.

I also enjoy the head-to-head aspect, rather then who can accumulate the most points.

Not as good as Puzzle Strike, because despite constant attacks there isn't really meaningful interaction as in how your opponent is playing will influence how you play mid-game -- it still feels like pick a strategy, race to [-]gain VP[/-] deal damage, with the added thing from Ascension of making tactical buy decisions with a changing-bank. But dealing 26 damage to your opponent in one turn is sitll a hell of a lot more satisfying than buying three provinces.

Initially, I'm not sure how balanced the game systems are, I think not very. There seem to be a few different strategies and interactions, but ultimately trashing + attacking seems very powerful and very safe compared to the others which rely heavily on luck -- future buys are unknown, making long-game play risky, and there are few ways to mitigage luck in the game (where combos are super powerful and you want to draw certain cards together) other than trashing and drawing. No way to save cards/stagger draws, no way to play cards from discard pile, etc. However, in theory, if the right cards come up, the healing and discard cards seem like great counters to trashers/attackers, just less reliable.

I expect it'll more likely just be a satisfying filler at most.

12/19/2014 - 7 - Very smooth, tremendous job integrating mechanics with theme.  It is quick and fun.  On the downside, I feel it is too determined by first few draws, and having only 5 in the draw stack makes it too luck driven.  I am not convinced that there is a huge gap between mediocre and good players.

This game could be a contestant for the best deck building game on sale at the moment for several reasons;
It is small and portable, it is well packaged with no waste of space (a lot of game companies should take note of this as shelf space is at a premium in most stores and modern homes) it is a very sensible price, Most importantly the gameplay is at least equal to the best of the other deckbuilders and better than most.

RATING: 6
Fantastic game. Quick, fun, tense and very cheap. What more can you ask for? The best filler for 2 players by far. This is the only deckbuilder I like actually (have not tried that many though). It just captures the essence of what's great about deckbuilders. At least to me. In 15 min playtime you get a good amount of player interaction and the excitment of the card draws from both your own deck and the 'shared' trade row is definitely there. The space theme is perfect and the different factions all have a distinct feel to them.

Yes, some turns are on auto pilot but there is usally still a lot of difficult choices you'll have to make over the course of a game. There is definitely a lot of luck in the game too, a good deal more than Dominion for sure and while I don't necessarily see this as a bad thing it does prevent me from rating it a pure 10. For now :) 

Lowered my rating by 1 because they didn't include two more sets of starting Scouts and Vipers. That forces me to buy a new copy of the basegame to play 3-4 players. Money grab

Lowered my rating by 2 because the pricing of the expansions. I have to pay more for fewer cards? Really? "Ohh don't worry, we've packed the expansions into 4 separate booster packs. 4x5$ instead of 1x20$ FEELS much cheaper!" BS and money grab.

Fast and fun but it feels like luck can play a pretty big role in who wins depending on what cards some out and what hands you get. You don't have as much controls over your strategy as other deck-building games that I like. Though for the price and the length of play (and how easily portable this is) I still recommend it.

The first deckbuilder I ever bought and played. I was underwhelmed by its mechanics because of its fast pace, lack of story/theme integration, and that it's hard to catch up with your opponent once they're ahead. I thought that maybe it was just this game, but I tried a bunch of other deckbuilders and found they suffer from similar problems. I came to the conclusion that I just don't like deckbuilders.

Clever little 2-player game, but I generally find random card rows in deck builders to be frustrating on the luck front, and that feels exacerbated by this being 2-player (Fun as it is to buy an 'okay' card then see something that's just straight better appear and disappear straight to your opponent for their turn).

Deck-building game with an emphasis on attacks rather than victory point accumulation. I like Puzzle Strike better in this genre; Star Realms doesn't have the same depth of interaction throughout the game. Buy choices aren't very reactive. It's more of an engine-building game with VPs that count down rather than up. I'm skeptical of the game's balance, but it's probably good enough for the light, casual game it is.

Star Realms is actually a great little "in-between" game.  It only takes around 20m to combined teach and play, and it offers some fun casual deckbuilding head-to-head play.  I could see it fitting into a board game night that included player elimination, once a 2nd player gets knocked out.

I have only played this on the Android app. However, what a let down. This proves that I'm fussy when it comes to deck-building games. Hugely popular among my gaming friends, I just don't get it.

I think a good deck-builder needs to use the mechanism to work towards a greater goal, not for the decks to be the only focus of the game. Boring! Combos, dull! Not for me.

A cool little card game that feels like a blend of Magic (different colors with individual strengths; attack the other player to reduce their life to 0) and Dominion (deck-building on the fly). My first game wasn't much fun: seemed almost totally random, sort of like a variant of Ascension -- with it's constantly changing card display and double currency -- but set in space and with direct player-on-player combat. The next one, though, was much better: we both paid closer attention to the cards, drafted a different combo of factions, and tried to play to our deck strengths. Fun!

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
Players each start with the same deck: 8 money ("trade") and 2 combat; shuffle and draw a hand of 5. The deck of cards, with a mix of bases and ships, is shuffled and 5 are put in a face up display. A pile of Explorers (2 trade, 2 combat) is also placed in display. Players each start with 50 life ("authority").

On your turn, play your cards for their currencies and/or effects:
- Trade is used to buy cards from the display (replenished immediately): buy as many as you can afford; cards go to discard pile.
- Combat is used to attack your opponent and/or their base(s); if they have "outpost" bases, you must attack them first. Destroyed bases go to that player's discard pile. Split your total combat value as needed to make as many attacks as possible.
- Ships and Bases provide a variety of effects. Many have additional effects if you have another card of that faction in display. Some can also be trashed ("scrapped" = removed from game) for additional effects. These effects tend to split along faction lines. One of them specializes in deck-thinning abilities, another in card-drawing, a third has powerful attack, and the fourth provides a lot of trade.

At the end of your turn, your Bases remain in play; other cards, played or still in hand, are discarded.

The first player to reduce opponent's life ("authority") to 0 wins!

RATING: 5
This is essentially just Ascension with a space theme.  It is a deckbuilder with a central row of cards and players take turns playing the cards from their hand to accumulate two resources, attack and buy power, and acquire cards from the center row to make their deck stronger.  Pretty much the only difference between this game and Ascension besides the theme is that attack power is used to directly hit your opponent instead of monsters in the center row and the winner is the person who drains the opponent's life total.  Even that really just is a minor difference from attacking monsters in the center row to accumulate victory points.

Even many of the factions serve identical roles to Ascension.  The red faction in this game (I forget the name) has cards that provide a lot of attack power and trash cards from your hand and discard pile, just like the purple faction from Ascension (I forget that name as well).

With it essentially being the same game unless you really dislike the theme from Ascension or really like the theme from this game there's really no reason to play this over Ascension.  Ascension has been around a lot longer and has a lot of additional content.  This game just came out and will get boring pretty quickly seeing the same cards over and over again.  Even comparing base sets this game is a lot more boring, none of the cards do anything exciting, just the same stuff with different numbers.

I've played this on my tablet/phone before so I had a good idea of what it was going in. The app has a few things going for it like instant shuffling, instant setup and asymmetric play.  The card game of course has human interaction and the other benefits of being a physical game.

The game is very random, strategy really doesn't seem to play much part in the game, you may luck into 3 or 4 cards of the same faction and steamroll your opponent because of it, or you may never see a combo and just never really take off. The game is very swingy and random but to an extent that's okay.

If I'm looking for a fast light deckbuilder type game this fits the bill but it's more a filler than a "lets play this all night" type game for me.

Rated after one play. 
Great theme, Great art, unique factions and abilities, and a very reasonable price. The design is similar to Ascension, but Star Realms is superior. The game feels streamlined, and far more competitive with direct attacks on your opponent rather than acquiring honour tokens. Some ships have optional trashing abilities included on them allowing strong plays and thinning of your deck (great design). Backed this on Kickstarter and I am looking forward to playing again. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
After trying and trying, I decided to give up. I wanted to like this one as much as I hoped to love Ascension. They both suffer from the same issue. Deckbuilders with a common cards offer built from a deck are not strategic enough (you cannot know what will turn out and cannot plan ahead). I wanted to accept the idea that as you play more, you get better and therefore, the game does have depth, but it's not true. Sure, you get better at it, but it only means that you come to recognize the best cards and combos when offered to you, which is not saying much. Between veteran players, the game is as shallow as it is between two clueless players buying whatever they can afford.

Simple, streamlined version of the Ascension-style deck builder. Very fun. Still suffers from the same problem that other Ascension-style deck builders have. ie: If one player misses out on getting really good cards early game because their one of their opponents grabbed it, they tend to suffer from it for the rest of the game. In particular, players who grab scrappers/exilers (cards that exile cards from the user's hand/deck; used for improving efficiency) early game whilst also depriving their opponents of opportunities to grab them, then they just win. The good thing is that the cards are designed in such a way that even in those situations it's not completely one-sided and the other player can still make a solid recovery and eventually a comeback.

Also, the battle system just works great. One of the main issues with deck builders is that during mid/late-game peoples' turns just take forever because they're getting off like a million consecutive draw card effects so they just take forever with their turns. Star Realms' battle system fixes that effectively because once any player does that, the game is most likely over, or at least soon to be over.

Definitely should only be played 1v1 or team v. team.

Update:
I've played this dozens and dozens of times since my initial review. Some cards and strategies are clearly better than others but still, the nature of the game doesn't emphasize balance. It emphasizes counter building. One thing that I appreciate even more about this game now is that it captures that hyper-competitive feel better than a lot of games I've played.

Original Review:
Easy to learn. Really quick but satisfying game. Not too deep but that's not the point. The combos are so satisfying. Oh so satisfying...  Super cheap to buy as well!

Reminiscent of ascension.  Noticeably better because it isn't about buying cards so you can buy cards which let you buy cards.  It's about kicking the crap out of your enemy.  I also feel games with the quickly cycling center row are much improved at lower player counts.

Wonderful little deck builder. A very close cousin to Ascension. Has the advantage over Ascension that you'll never have the wrong currency to buy or defeat cards from the center row, as it requires only one. Van ben a bit swingey, but it's also very short with a minimum of set-up time.

Really cool deck building game, takes minutes to explain, and can be fleshed out as the first play through is happening, example: "bases that have a black background are optional to attack, silver are not", "cards that are from the same colour faction that are in play during your turn, usually add additional effects" I also like the reasonable play time. 20min (box) 30min (setup and explanation to new player)

Wonderful little deck builder.  I enjoy it best as team play, weirdly, using more than one deck.  The expansions are a little disappointing, but very cheap.  Its actually my favorite pure deck builder and my favorite minigame (although it is not a true minigame).  Very good game.  My only concern, is that I may play it to burn out level, but that is not really a criticism.  Anyway, if it seems vaguely interesting to you, I would buy it because it is both very good and very cheap.

Good 2pl, intro to deckbuilding. Enjoy the theme, but turns out I am horrible at deck building! (Probably should have learned that lesson after playing Friday)

Burnt out on this for solo play (never beat the bots, sigh). Will play with my partner, and it is enjoyable even if I get my ass handed to me every time - at least it's a quick death.

RATING: 8.2
Overall: Deep competitive tactical game with cool theme. 8.2/10

Gameplay: This is where the game shines. Although this card is fairly luck dependent, but like poker, the better player will always have a higher win percentage in the long run. Like poker, this game will appeal to both casual and competitive gamers. The card draft mechanic is neat and a game can be easily finished in 30mins. 

Components: Artwork is simple and crisp, but can turn off certain gamers. Everything fits nicely in a small portable box. For those that prefer fantasy, there is Hero Realms, which is mechanically similar fantasy themed game. 

Replay value: This game has so many expansions, the replay value is quite high. Since games are quite short, one game is never enough.

Star realms is like dating in high school. Initially it was a fresh, delightfully fast paced, and addicting experience. But the more I tried it the more I realized I was left completely unfulfilled since my options were limited and ultimately whatever I chose to do had little impact on the outcome. Try a game with substance because a year or two from now, you and star realms won't be together anymore.

Yep, it's great. Nice quick deck-builder. So far, it's my second favorite to Dominion. Faster than Dominion, but only two player (basically). It also features direct player attacking, which is good for some, less good for others. I love the multiple different ways you can play it.

I've played it about 15 times now--in two nights! Over and over again.

I'm not a huge fan of the randomness of this kind of deck-builder. It sucks when the cards you want to buy are only ever available on another opponents turn. That said, this one is quick and light and I'm happy to play it. 

I've played this one with cards and via the digital game. The extra story mode stuff added to the digital version makes for an interesting, if occasionally very frustrating, solo experience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Light deckbuilding game that for once eschews "get points" for "crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentations of their civil partners of any gender".

Cards provide either coins (buy stuff) or attack (attack the enemy). The key differentiator is the faction bonus system, whereby most cards have a bonus effect which activates if another card of the same colour was out in the same turn. Some cards, representing planets and space stations, can be played for persistent benefits (as well as permanently assisting with faction bonuses); if they are "outposts" then they must be destroyed before the player can be hurt.

You know, sometimes I feel like the bar has really been lowered by the proliferation of deckbuilding games post-Dominion. More than most of its competitors, Star Realms is obviously derived from Magic: the Gathering, and its limitations -- the almost total lack of strategy beyond, the feeble excuse for engine-building -- help highlight just how good traditional constructed-deck games are.

Star Realms has peppy pacing and is sufficiently different from the current crop to feel like a breath of fresh air, but scratch the surface and it's just as constrained and dull in slightly different ways. Not a patch on Ascension, or even on other non-entirely-successful attempts at Magic distillation, like Small Box Games' Tooth & Nail: Factions.

We thought was ok, I liked it better. But my wife really doesn't enjoy sci-fi themes, no matter how pasted on they may be. She suggested a super-hero theme would be much more enjoyable (as an example). She also prefers scoring where the final result is not known until the end.

The base game itself is incredibly fun. Don't be fooled by the small package the card deck comes in. Once you get the hang of it, it's unbelievably addictive. And the expansions just add to the fun.

The game tends to be fairly short, so it's good for a quickie. It's a deck-builder, so each game will be different. The mobile app of the game is exactly the same, and is highly recommended, since you can play with friends or anonymous people, with or without expansions.

Deckbuilder which you don't need to explain much before you fire off the first game with another first time player.

Lots of variance, where only good strategy can make you stand a chance.

Quick deck builder that has some interesting decisions. I feel like the cards for life is wonky and the healing ships can be a bit strong, but overall it is a decent game.

I've found it had a run away leader problem that is often determined in the first 4 or 5 turns. Not bad but feels a bit samey and programmed out. Need to try it with the expansions, although it seems Hero Realms is a better version of the system.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This game is my favorite card game (as is Hero Realms). Everyone plays with the same cards, builds their play decks on the fly to their liking to beat the opponent, which makes this a very strategic and tactical game without spending money constantly like Magic: The Gathering or pre-building decks. This game is also fun with 3, 4, or even 6 people. 5 people is the only one that seems a little unlikely but it's still possible as you could play it similar to a 3 player 1st eliminated loses and person that killed them is the winner.
It's interesting to see how this game is beginning to branch in a different direction than Hero Realms with the mission, gambit, events, and dual faction cards.

Ascension with more luck.

The art is of that soulless 'digital' style that permeates everything these days. It's well done but I hate it. The game did convince me that it has some good strategic options but there weren't interesting tactical choices. There was no difference in feeling between this and any other deck builders on the market. The whole engine building and combat systems had nothing evolutionary let alone revolutionary to get me excited and the game tells no story at all. This is a game for serious competitors and it's up against games such as Ascension, Dominion, Solforge, Hearthstone etc but I can't find enough of a difference between them to recommend one over the other. Pick one that your friends play if this sort of thing interests you. I'm going back to RftG and Innovation.

RATING: 7
Deck building, space combat game.  One deck is for 2 players.  To play more players, you need another deck for every 2 players.  Works better with an even number of players, although there is an all against 1 version for 3 or more players that can handle odd numbers of players.

There are some expansion packs that came with this game that add a solitaire and cooperative versions of the game.  The first solitaire and cooperative versions were not very good and made the game more difficult with more players.  You could end up with everyone having only 1 card (instead of 5) on your turn or you could be dealt 24 damage on the first turn.  The second cooperative expansions seem much more balanced.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Pros: Simple, quick deckbuilder. 

Cons: Maybe too simple. Needs more content/cards.

Final thoughts: Honestly there's nothing really wrong with this game. I'd just rather play other deckbuilders that offer more. But if I have a short amount of time and want to play a deckbuilder, that's when this one comes in very handy.

Great light deckbuilding game! 

Definitely fires Dominion in my book: instead of 'watering down' your deck to get VP's (where is the fun in that) it gives all or your cards a purpose (except unspent gold, perhaps) and each time you buy a new card it's like 'yay, that will come in handy'.

It has this nice flip of gold engine -> damage engine into it and we picked this up easily.

Quality of the components is decent enough - will be hunting for this one.

I had low expectations of this; I'm really not a fan of most deckbuilders.

This is more of the same trivial deck building, ascension style with random cards to buy each turn for each player.

At least it's fast, but it's kind of meh, not much going on, and no soul.  In the end, I find out really kind of boring, and there isn't much in it that I would want to play it anymore.

A super simple deck-building game that I probably would not  play very much (compared to Dominion, Thunderstone or Nightfall) except that all my gaming friends, that I have introduced it to, really love it.

Update again:  Crap!  This game is amazing!  My son had 1 point left. One!  I had 26.  In one crushing turn, he flipped a ton of cards  and blasted me out of the universe.  He was jumping around, fists in the air.  I am looking for expansion.  10+

Update:  Playing with my 8 year old son.  He keeps asking to play.  He's absolutely in love with the game.  

(No experience with Ascension or Magic) Superb!  I've never had a game up and running so quickly by simply reading the rules.  Fast, fluid, fun, filler-ish, with fighting factions, and even, a times, a bit frenetic.  Great for those who are frugal.  $15!  

On a personal note, I almost didn't buy this because my wife does NOT like confrontational games.  That this game is entirely based on wiping out your opponent did not bode well.  However, she was able to pick it up quickly after we played a starter 30 point game.  She was annoyed and a bit antagonistic at first--especially after an initial loss.  However, she quickly realized she had been too non-confrontational and attacked heavily, in the second 50 point game, and won! 

This game is about as smooth a game as I have run into.  The card design is intuitive and tactical plans are very easy to formulate.   The factions make strategic planning a breeze.  As an added bonus, the card art is deeply impressive.

I had only wanted a 2 player game.  I'm considering another pack now.  

Looking forward to expansions.  Wow!

I heard many good things about this deck builder. Since I enjoy such games and this had a lot of direct interaction (something my son loves) so I had to get it. I read the rules and it seemed somewhat complicated. Then played it and, boy, it was so easy to play! Plays fast, has a lot of interaction and a decent decision space. Play count has gone up quickly and I've had many friends purchase their own copy after playing. Of course I had to get the box with card sleeves and some expansions. LOVE IT!

I own this one on Android.

I don't know the game IRL, but the port seems pretty solid as it flows well.

Regarding the game itself, it's really enjoyable deckbuilding fast paced game with a lot of different strategies available. Extensions add interesting rules and cards.
It's easy to learn, what may be "hard" at start is to know every card, but you get fastly used to it.

Playing IRL against your friend must be even cooler, so I can only recommend this game.

I still don't know if I like this or Ascension better. What I do know is that it's a solid little deck-building game in the same design family as Ascension. Does it add anything amazingly new to the field? No. But it does a lot right for $15. Very enjoyable filler. Rating may rise as I learn the cards.

Star Realms is what I was expecting Core Worlds to be.  I like how the different colors work and how they combo together.  The star bases are a really unique mechanism that I enjoy.  As a 2 player game, I would much rather play this than Core Worlds, Race, or Dominion.  Additional accolades for the portable size and making a good game with only cards.

Overrated. The combos in this are too powerful and not very interesting. Colour co-ordinate and you can nuke an opponent essentially, overkill. It's too light and quick. Really it's a worse implementation of the Ascension system. Still, I like the bases idea, and being able to defend with them works well with the 'attack one another' twist on the Ascension system. The direct combat is apparently Magic inspired, but I would rather just play Ascension or Magic. If they didn't exist however, I would probably still be playing Star Realms.

I like Star Realms and enjoy some of the ways it differs from Ascension. That said, I would never want to play the analog version after playing the app. The combos generated, especially later in the game, can be hard to track and the life cards, while an elegant solution to keep the game profile small, are fiddly.

Logged hundreds of plays on the digital version. I think it deserves a 9 just for that.

==Not for you if==

Luck does play a role. Apart from getting unlucky with your hand, taking a card from the trade row can potentially reveal a good card for your opponent who happens to have the right cards to take that card.

Very rarely, the outcome might be decided on the first few  turns just because one of the players was very unlucky and the other one was very lucky (assuming that both players have a certain level of understanding of the game and won't make obvious mistakes later on).

This game has been a great deck builder on the go. It is small and there is enough balance for a decent two player experience. It is nice to have the option to go more than two, though I haven't tried it. Unique to the deck building genre, it uses a direct attack against the other players to get a win, whereas, typically, the deck building genre ranges from cooperation to a more euro-style victory-point-grab.

The only negative I have is the cards supplied for keeping score. They could be a bit more intuitive. With one number on the front and a different one on the back, the player has to think a moment how best to use the cards to merely track your remaining "authority" points. There have been games that we have had to use alternate means because the requisite cards were not available to keep score. 

Altogether, not a bad buy. The game was very affordable when I bought it at $15 and if you spend an hour and half playing it you have spent what you would've on a movie for you and a friend.

The game needs a far better distribution than it currently has. 30 € for a deck whose box will tear apart with the third opening at the latest is far too expensive. However, it's a good conflict-driven deckbuilding game with appealing sci-fi artwork whose parallels to Ascension are quite striking. With the already mentioned benefit of attacking other players directly. I like it.

It has interesting tactics and deck building. Super portable and no existing setup time. Great price. It plays very fast also. Addictive! 


Star realms has a very good mobile version. Good AI and an active online community.

The skill ceiling is not very high compared to the randomness. To bad the deck is the same every game.

Amazing value for money, incredibly accessible (and I've never played Ascension), engaging gameplay, fairly short playing time, this gem of a game has everything I love about card games. For me this is the new Magic The Gathering. I've played this hundreds of time on my Android device and I've just started to play it IRL with my wife.

One regret I have is that I only found out about it in September 2014 and I wish I had kickstarted it.

I also wish the publisher was more active as I've sent them emails which have all been left unanswered.

Besides, the promos can be very difficult and/or costly to source for non-convention/tournament participants.

Deck-development game about an intergalactic war. Very similar to Ascension, but with direct conflict (i.e. I shoot you, you shoot me).

The best "deck-builder" for tactical attack and defense play; someone finally figured out how to effectively integrate direct conflict into an economic engine deck-development game. It's really good.

My rating may shift after getting more accustomed to the game... I don't know if knowing the cards better will improve or deflate my appreciation.

Logging all Star Realms plays here, even for Colony Wars games.

What a great game. Besides my grail deckbuilders, Dominion and Core Worlds, this is probably the best I've played. It's certainly a lot better than the other "draft cards that are drawn randomly from a deck" deckbuilders such as DC, Legendary, and Ascension. This game basically fixes all of the problems with those games by making all of the cards useful. No longer do you have to build your deck around one certain type of cards, because pretty much every card is useful to some degree. 

I just wish there were a multiplayer version. Sure, there are rules for playing with more than two players, but it seems like that just wouldn't work because of the attacking. In free-for-all, weaker players could just get eliminated right away. In the "attack your left-hand neighbor" mode, the weakest player would give a disadvantage to his neighbor.

Still, this is one of the best two-player deckbuilders out there.

I hoped the fan-made solo variants would help me out but alas, I don't find this game to be a lot of fun.
I'm pretty much going to replace this with Airborne Commander (not the same theme whatsoever, but AC's fun factor is much higher).

My guess is that this is a good two person game (as it is designed to be), but that's not enough for me...

Good about the game: Fast set up.
Not good about the game: Kind of boring.

I'm a bit puzzled by the amount of hype this game continues to get. Perhaps I need to play it more to see if I overlooked something, but my interest-level isn't really there.

Most of the art is pretty nice, but the graphic design around it, while very functional, is pretty bland. Overall, I would say the game is just too loose. You can do whatever you want, meaning there were few tough decisions. Unlimited actions and buys makes for dull play. For the most part, I committed to buying cards from 2 factions, usually choosing the most expensive and/or outposts, if available. Then just play all my cards and see what happens.

This is more of nitpick, but I also found using a dozen cards to track health to be pretty fiddly.

I am not a big fan of deck-building games. I just don't enjoy most of the games in the genre. I like Star Realms though. The nature that you are attacking is probably the factor that does it for me.

Very easy to teach, set up, and have fun with.

-The factions feel very varied and their interactions are interesting
-Interesting descisions based on what you have already bought, what your opponent has and can get and estimated time until the game ends

The replay value is fine and randomness is medium giving newer players a slight chance :)

To me it's the best deckbuilder

-The card container is pretty fragile
Randomness a bit too high, but not high enough to give new players a chance

I like deck building. Dominion, the papa of deck builders, never really grabbed me by the lips though. Maybe it's the dry, pasted on theme, or the fact that the piles are pre-determined, and you can plan your deck from the start. Star Realms is a great deck builder that plays quick and forces you to react to the current situation. The ally abilities of the ships are powerful, and force you to make tough decisions about buying the best available card, or the best available ally. I like that you have to attack each other rather than amass victory points. The theme is also great. Who doesn't like hot laser death in space? The game plays great with 2 players, but leaves much to be desired with more than that. I love it.

I have been playing pretty hard core, for a couple of weeks now. Love the game, but it seems to me, that the luck factor on the draw, can really mess up your game, meaning  you can be scraping a lot of your scouts and still be drawing them, way out of proportion to your other better cards.  Curiously this seems to happen after you win a few games in a row,  HMMMMM?

Rating is based on initial play, I've tried it 4 player so far.

So, this game is like the clarion call to anyone who doesn't like deckbuilders for the "solo" aspect.  There is heavy multi-player action here, along with fun mechanics and some nice artwork.

The game largely centers around getting faction combos, and has a "river" of available cards, similar to Ascension.  The gameplay seems well balanced, with the ability to get life back and setup outposts that act as shields.

Overall, a REALLY fun first experience, and I expect this to become a staple for a long time.  Bravo!

RATING: 7
Star Realms is a two player deck building game where you directly attack the other player.  It's a little surprising that it took this long for somebody to come out with a direct combat deck builder.  There are a couple of new interesting ideas in Star Realms, namely ally bonuses when cards of the same faction come out on a turn, and the ability to permanently trash cards for a one-off bonus.

Nothing in Star Realms is extraordinarily revolutionary or groundbreaking, but it does what it does very well.  It's a very enjoyable quick deck building game.  I can see this game getting a good bit of play with my son and myself.

[thing=147020][/thing] is a deck building that comes in a tiny box ([thing=463][/thing] early style) whose cards won't ever, ever return to the box if they are sleeved (I know this isn't a big issue for players US, but it is important around here, in Brazil, due to the big expanse that is shipping and taxes).

[thing=147020][/thing] uses mechanics akin to those of [thing=69789][/thing] and [thing=129437][/thing]. Basically the deal is this: each player uses trade (money) do acquire spaceships and stations/bases, and uses them to attack the other opponent (lowering his Authority value). Spaceships are cards that you use and then discards; stations, once you put them on the table, they stay there for use in later turns - the bases can be attacked by your opponent, so that you lose the constant benefit of them (but this, of course, protects your Authority value, since the attack is mostly used against the station).

The cards avaialble for purchase stay in a track in the middle of the table, and after one or more of them are bought, new ones come from the main deck - it is the same as what happens in [thing=69789][/thing], in [thing=125678][/thing] and in [thing=129437][/thing], and has the same issue of all of those: you may have a high value of trade in your turn and not a pretty good card to buy (though, from what I saw, most of the cards are, at least, useful, but there might not be an excellent card that fits into what you really want to get accordingly to your strategy in the game), and you buy one or other just because, and then an awesome card shows up for your opponent to take. The biggest advantage of this way of dealing with the cards is that the set up is a breeze (just shuffle everything and you are good to go), and also you have, prior to playing, less explanation to do (you just have to look and explain those five that showed up - but you do will have to lose time reading the effects of new cards most of the time).

In a similar way to what happens in [thing=129437][/thing], [thing=147020][/thing] makes cards from the same faction to combine among themselves, creating lots of synergies when cards of the same faction are played in the same turn (and the bases really help this to happen, since they stay on the table and count as a "played" card in every turn they are there), and this works great to make some cards with lower value be actually sought after for a player, since it goes with the others he already purchased earlier, which makes the "always buy the most expensive one" have way less of an effect in the gameplay decisions.

There are fours factions in the base game: the Trade Federation, the Blobs, the Star Empire and the Machine Cult. Each faction has somewhat of a focus, which makes them different from each other: the Trade Federation generates more trade value and Authority (this is basically your "life points"); the Blobs makes some powerful attacks; the Star Empire also have some good attacks, but also makes you draw more cards and your opponent to discard; and the Machine Cult, besides being an awesome metal band name, also has strong bases and allows the player to get rid of unwanted cards, taken them out of your deck.

One unique thing for [thing=147020][/thing] is that most of its cards has a trash effect: you get a one time bonus, and the card goes to the box, out of your deck. Since, as expected, the trash effects are pretty good, you usually are torn between use it or keep the card for later uses. This not only works great to give the players more options, while also makes deck-thinning less important (in [thing=36218][/thing] and several others, for instance, deck-thinning is usually the best way to go, so it is nice to see a change of pace).

The purpose of the game is to make your opponent Authority to reach zero (each player starts with 50). Some bases have a key-name: Outpost, and these your opponent must attack first before attacking you directly (so, for instance, say you have two Outposts in the table, one with value 5 and the other 4, and your opponent gives a total attack of 12 - in this case, the two Outposts would be destroyed (going into your discard pile) and your Authority value would be lowered by 3 points (the excess of damage). It is important that the Outpost defense value must be overcome in a single attack, because damage is not marked on the card nor it stays from one turn to the other (so, if a Outpost has a 5 value, and your attack has a strength of 4, you won't to a thing to the Outpost). The winner will be the first player to reduce the other player's Authority to zero.

Those that know my taste in games are aware that confrontational games for two players aren't really my thing - I don't really like to conflict directly to someone else (in a multiplayer game, this is majorly lessened because of the presence of other players, thus the "head to head" fight, even when it occurs, I don't really mind). So, what I think of [thing=147020][/thing]? Surprisingly enough, I did like it, quite a bit, actually. The gameplay is agile, dynamic, the turns play fast and the synergies are interesting to pull off. The art is great! A game quickly becomes is a constant of massive attacks, so the 50 Authority points don't last much once they start to fade. Even when I was learning the game, a whole play didn't last longer than 20 minutes!

At this point I can't avaluate if the overall game tends more to the side of great plays or the side of the luck into taking the best and more unique cards, since because all different the cards come from the main deck, it is possible that one powerful card only shows up once (even if it has multiple copies of it in the deck). Also, one can invest in a faction, only to see cards for it coming in droplets. I couldn't see a way to avoid or control this (there are cards that let you scrap cards from the central row, usually one you don't want your opponent to take, and this can accelerate the main deck in order for it to spill some good cards for you, but you can't be sure of this - you can take out a great card for your opponent just to put an amazing one in its place). However, some degree of luck will always be a part of any deck builder (it's a feature, not a bug), but those that work with a central track for the purchase of cards tend to suffer more in this matter - and in my play, even though it was furious and fun, it wasn't balanced: the result was 25 to -13 (yes, negative 13).

Anyway, I liked what I saw and what I played, and it was possible to see why [thing=147020][/thing] is receiving so much attention lately: I wanted to play again right after the end of the game (and [thing=147020][/thing] intends exactly this: repeated plays, since experienced players can surely have 3 or 4 matches in one hour). So, is [thing=147020][/thing] approved? Yes, it is!

Fairly well balanced and light Deck Building Game.

However it can be a bit swingy as any other DBG can be when you start building up massive combo turns.

Reminds me of a cross between Dominion (a deck-builder where your hand starts with 5 cards and there is also a market) and Hearthstone (and the only game I can think of where you have HP and armor!). Simple rules but such depth. I particularly like that by playing cards of the same suite you can often get bonuses. The only design feature I will question was the use of the 1, 5, 10 and 20 authority (HP) cards; would it not have been more simple to do two sets of 5 cards (0-1, 2-3, 4-5, 6-7, 8-9)?

RATING: 7
A fast-playing, streamlined deckbuilder. But the amount of random chance is much higher here than in Dominion. That, combined with the relaxed constraints (compared to Dominion) make this a less interesting game for me, compared to Dominion. That being said, it's still an enjoyable game, that offers a fun "space fleet battles" vibe.

The only game which my wife really enjoys playing and asks me to play with her. The games are extremely fast and losing does not feel too bad (we usually play 3-6 games in a row). Artwork is awesome and all four factions feel different but at the same time balanced. I recommend that if you like the game you should buy colony wars and mix the two decks since then you will not see same cards too often. The only reason why this is not a 10 is that I would hope that the bases/ships had a bit more complex/unique abilities to support more strategy/choices.

This is the fastest deck-building game I have played, which is great when time is too short for the longer deck-building games. Also, the unique mechanic of reducing your opponent's hit points to zero, rather than accumulating victory points, makes this game unique in the genre. The app is also well made, with a challenging AI.

This is a really good deck building game but it's a lot more fun and flows better as a phone app. The game itself is more fiddly than the base version of Dominion but the app tracks all card effects brilliantly. In fact the app has put us off playing the clunky card version, which is a bit of a shame. Star Realms is unlikely to see many plays we've got Hero Realms with the new damage tracker cards.

I have played Star Realms over 100 times and since I now know the cards and patterns it is easy to tell which side is going to win within the first 3-4 turns.  In a nutshell this is a fast paced light damage game where the winner is often the player who stumbles on the resources needed to buy the best toys first then steamrollers to victory.  Star Realms is the type of game where you need to play it a bunch of times to mitigate random losses due to the above so it really works better as an app.  Recommended for tweens to early teens as a gateway game for future real deck building (like MtG) endeavours and a mental distraction while squeezing out a long crap.  Star Realms is worth the app price but not more than $10 for a physical copy.

That's ok, it has a place.  And I like that place sometimes...

Star Realms is a highly portable, streamlined, quick to play deckbuilder that was an instant hit with my friends, my girlfriend and my 12 year old son. Everyone just wanted to play again right after their first play. Soon after my first couple of games, I sold Ascension. The games are too similar for me to keep both in my collection, and it is more fun to try and eliminate your opponent than it is to obtain the most victory points. The only thing that bugged me about Ascension, is that each card has a vp value, making deck thinning less appealing than in Star Realms. Best with two, even though attacking your left neighbour while defending against attacks from the right works fine as well.

As crazy as this sounds, this replaced Dominion for me. What I'm after in a pure deck builder is quick set up time, quick playing time and just none of the headaches that so many deck builders seem to fall victim to. 

It does lose the intricacies where the closer you are to winning, the harder it becomes to win as you simply need to reduce your opponent's life total to 0 and don't have victory point cards clogging up your deck. At the same time, not having to count and see who won at the end is a plus. 

Quick, fun, fantastic!

Update 01/03/15 - Dropped from a 8 to a 6. There are more issues; I wonder if big money is just disguised in this game and thus less of a problem. The random flip can be incredibly frustrating (even though games can be quite fast). It's still enjoyable but I think I may be bored of it. The expansions seem to lead to longer games which detracts from what made Star Realms so great.

Update 10/04/15 - Dropped from a 6 to a 4. This is just marginally better than Dominion for the length it takes. Otherwise forget it; being on the receiving end because your opponent just has perfect money and the perfect card flips after you buy is one of the worst feelings in gaming. The AI in the ios app is a rampant cheater. I've lost count of the number of times where I've bought a 8 cost base, only to end up dying before drawing it, and it being in the last 5 cards of my deck.

Update 22/05/15 - Dropped from a 4 to a 3. I can't even play the iOS app anymore due to the amount of cheating the AI employs. It's maddening; to the point where it feels like the game is playing me.

Update 19/06/15 - Dropped to a 1. I'm never going to play this game again.

Update 02/07/15 - Upgraded back to a 5. This is fine once in a while, and only with the expansions. At least the random events and the new cards make this a little fresher. I refuse to play just the base game or the app with just the base game. I know the events aren't everyone's cup of tea, but this game is already incredibly high variance, you can't really take this all too seriously.

Crsis - Bases & Battleships
Crisis - Events

Current pinnacle of the deck-building scene. Easy to learn but offers great many approaches and variance. Faction abilities, card mechanics and general rules are well laid and the usual deck-building ills of solitaire play (this game is truly interactive with punches taken and received left and right) and trailing are almost completely gone from this. Tracking authority is a bit clumsy but past that very little to improve here. By far the best #-building game you can shop for. Affordable as well. Can't really help that these never managed to set me ablaze.

A second thought after too many matches played:
The choice in this game is an illusion. You play all your cards from hand every round and shop from a limited pool of cards that actually narrows down the more you play (as winning tactics dictate what you buy). The game pretty much plays itself and after a while I am starting to bore as audience.

Strengths: Cool scifi theme, great bang for the buck, very easy to learn, takes some time to master (replayability), lots of cool combos (replayability), fast play. The mechanics work very well within their limits.

Biggest gripe: Ultimately, and provided that both players' game mastery is on par, victory is decided by (draw) luck. 

Verdict: A great filler games for gamers, and a good way to introduce non-gamers/casual gamers to deck-builders/-cyclers. 

Still, people who like games to be won on meaningful decisions will get a) attracted and b) ultimately disappointed by this game.

While playing a different game at an open table at PAX 2016, we chatted up some folks nearby. One guy had just come in 8th at the Star Realms tourney, and was telling us about how great it was. His friend next to him offered to let us use his base deck to try it out. Explanation of the rules was simple given our past deck-builder experience and off we went! Chris bought the game and an expansion within an hour later!

Now that we have played it a handful of times more, my review: It's a standard deck builder, which I would compare to Marvel Legendary in that depending on the "faction" you buy/build up over the course of the game, there are positive interactions between the cards. I like the addition of bases and outposts to act as interesting modifiers to direct player interactions. Where it differs from M:L is you can set up, learn, and begin to play your first game of Star Realms in about 5 minutes. It is SO EASY to set up, play, and clean up, and can fit in your pocket! Also, right now a base set is like $14, or closer to $10-$12 on sale. Expansions are also cheap and plentiful.

I am eager to try a larger game. Right now we have only played two-player, but it must be really different to have to choose which competitors to attack or defend against with multiple opponents.

2-player, competitive deck-building game. Similar to Ascension, players take turns adding cards to their deck from a "trading area" of five shared cards. Themed to space battles, with four distinct factions, each with their own theme and strategy. Victory requires complementary pairing of two or more factions, and each game is unique, due to the random nature of the cards available for purchase. Games between two players wrap up in less than thirty minutes.

This is the first deck builder I've played that makes me think I don't need Dominion in my collection anymore.  It's lighter and the decisions probably aren't as interesting (pre expansions anyway), but it feels right.. the same way Dominion did.  And a much smaller footprint to boot.  Love it.

-Short playtime and easy to teach, simple mechanics but still deep and meaningful choices.
-Strategy can be developed a lot while the tactical aspect is fairly straight-forward, this leads to very little AP as the momentary choices are always few but the long-term choices bring the depth.
-Round off with a suitable amount of randomness.
-Theme is good and present in the different factions. What more can a man wish for in a 15 minute game.

RATING: 7
One play with three, we used some expansions, so it is hard to give a rating just for the base game and for the expansion, when I don't know which cards belong to which set.

Anyway, the game felt good, very Dominion-like, but without collecting points and with blasting other players. Might get a better rating, but that requires more plays. And with more plays, the game length gets shorter. It might be the expansions, but it felt, that there were quite a lot of rules and text in the cards. The base game is probably simpler (and faster). I have no problems playing this more in the future.

Updated with 2 duels and just the base game, feels good, but I was a bit too slow.

Star realms is a head to head combo deckbuilder. The design manages to cut out the middle fluff that I don't care for in most deckbuilders, the grind, while still giving you a chance to create a true engine and chain some amazing combos. The balance of the card sets and different factions is excellent allowing for many viable strategies for victory.

For a quick, combo chaining deckbuilding experience you can't find better than Star Realms (unless you're interested in playing with more than 2, but that comes with its own caveats...)

Really fun little game that brings some actual variety to the worn out deck building genre. Don't really recommend with an odd amount of players (3, 5, 7, etc.) since teamups are devastating.

The game is entertaining and seems to be pretty balanced (an all-out assault deck runs the risk of losing if that player can't attack the other players quickly enough to eliminate them before they defend-attack you), but I'm bothered that the game plays 2-6, but only by purchasing multiple decks.  How about you include what I need to play with the maximum number right in the box and then let me decide how many players I want to add to the game?

Deck building ligero. Ideal para una partida rápida después de la pausa para comer, o mientras estás esperando a que llegue el resto del grupo de juego.

Pero el juego es demasiado aleatorio para intentar seguir una estrategia.

Se juega más o menos bien a dos jugadores, pero se hace largo y aburrido si entran más jugadores (se puede ampliar el número de dos jugadores comprando barajas extra).

Fun, fun, fun!  I liked that the variety of different cards in the game gave lots of different avenues to try when building your deck, but the limited number of cards available to buy each round didn't leave you bogged down with AP inducing decisions to make. It was also quick to play and also very tense.  With the right combination of cards, some devastating blows could be dealt and things could shift (or end) really quickly, so you just hope the right hand shows up for you before your opponent.

This is a pure deck builder that has a lot of similarities with Ascension, but with much more interesting combos built into the game's four factions. It can feel a little swingy, as many times the game ends abruptly on one player's massive turn. It's a lot of fun though, and gets more so with experience, as you start to learn the card pool.

A super fast, super escalating game of belting one another with spaceships that has a wonderful dynamic of faction synergies. With four core factions, various abilities including stacking damage, bonus card purchases, enemy hand discards and extra card-draws, Star Realms almost always feels like it's flowing quickly and it a blast (hurr hurr) to play.

Friends of mine are testing their own variants with the game and it's so wonderfully primed for interesting custom-made game types, there's so much more mileage in this than the impressive breadth offered out of the box.

It's ok, you can pull off some pretty cool combos in this game, but I don't like the random card row (keeping track of your hit points is a pain too).

Not the usual deck building game, ok. But it didnt give me good emotions, at least during the game. In retrospect, it is not that bad: the idea of attacking and defending is truly good but there are probably too many things to take into account, too many little calculations. It's an ok game if you don't mind to see yet another deckbuilding game. Nice graphics. I hate that i have to keep track of points on a piece of paper with a pen. The game could drag on for a long time if many green shields are collected. Our 2 vs 2 players game didnt last too much but it came at an end rather abruptly...; i'd like to retry it just to be sure it is not the great game BGG rating would make us believe
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
What a great little deck builder that's incredibly reminiscent of Ascension: row of cards available to everyone, those cards are part of various factions, there are two currencies, and getting rid of cards can be a large part of the game. However, instead of just trying to gain abstract points, you're trying to destroy your opponent(s) and I think it makes for a more interesting game.

The other part of this game that I really enjoy is the fact that you can start playing for $15 and if you want to play with more, just add in another $15 deck of cards and you're ready to go. It's up to you how much you want to spend and how many people you want to play with, something I wish other games would even consider.

Given the price, it's definitely worth a purchase if you like either deck builders or sci-fi games.

This is a great two player deck building game. By adding two copies of the game together this can be played with up to 6 players. I think that it plays similarly with 4 or 2 players, but some people do not like the mode I prefer where you attack the player to your left. Regardless of player count there is a significant variety between factions that is a lot of fun.

First of all, this has fantastic art and is wonderfully portable. It offers a decent deckbuilding experience, though I think it still falls slightly short of Dominion in that respect due to the more random nature of cards available for purchase; it offers little in the way of long-range strategy. The best aspect of the game, however, is the addition of cooperative and solo challenges. That may give it an edge over similarly SF themed deckbuilder Eminent Domain.

Too random. Given that this game ripped off Ascension, they should have made sure to have the decisions this time around be more than choosing between the two things you can afford each turn.

Two player deck building game with a sci-fi theme.  More aggressive than Dominion and with synergy between cards being a more core/defined mechanic.  I'd probably rather play Dominion if at home, but Star Realms isn't much bigger than a pack of cards so it makes for a very good travel game.

A very fun and fast-paced deck-building game that works best for 2 players. The only major downside is that you need to buy two copies for 4+ people, but there is an expansion coming out soon. I really do love the fact that you can actually attack others in this game. Also very easy to set up and tear down.

A great quick filler game.  Works pretty well but doesn't seem as balanced as it could be.  There is a swingy luck element but the game plays so quickly that I don't mind as much.  It certainly isn't as controllable as dominion or Trains, but it also allows new players to be more effective.

Decent deck building game along the same lines as MtG without the pre-built deck. A bit simple but fast and fun allowing for multiple games or just a quick filler.
I don't really feel there is much depth to this . There never seems to be enough real decisions to make and it feels too light.

A deck-builder that allows me to destroy my opponent via direct damage rather than scoring victory points. Thank heavens for small miracles.

Pros:
- Super cheap
- Fits in pocket
- Plays very quickly
- Great conversation starter when super models rummage through my clothes

Cons:
- Two-player only without multiple sets
- Probably doesn't play well with more than two anyway
- Won't start my car if I lose my keys
- Subject to washing machine damage if still in pocket at the end of the week

Star realms is a fantastic card drafting game. Unlike Dominion where the goal is to accrue as much land as possible, Star realms has player elimination, so the player who wins is the one who plays the last blob fighter.

One of my personal favs to introduce to someone when there's just two of us sitting around. The setup time is under a minute at the rules can be taught during play which make it perfect for getting right into some action.

It's definitely very luck driven, a couple of good market reveals for your opponent can have you pretty much shafted for the game. But that really doesn't stop me from wanting to play or enjoying myself when I do. In a way, the luck helps the game be more approachable, as even a pro will get it handed to them when the deck just isn't in their favor.

And man is it satisfying to land those crazy huge combos!

After playing a little i can see a potential for this getting addictive. Simple Dominion like deck building with a direct combat phase. I like Thunderstone over Dominion for the combat/dungeon part. But it is not the direct one. So Star Realm scratches another itch. Though it is very simple and i can see how luck can play a big part there. But it is short and simple game.

Star Realms might just be the best 15 dollars I've spent on gaming. I don't think any deck builder is as approachable while still as complex and deep as Star Realms. With just a deck of cards it also manages to ooze theme and communicate an entire world.

I think Star Realms sets the standard for what a deck builder can be--setting aside price. Bring price into the equation and it's a no brainer.

One of the best 2 player games that I have ever played. It plays quick and usually ends with a one turn difference in terms of who is victorious.

I got interested in this game as I'm quite the fan of the Dominion series. I like the deckbuilding aspect of this game, but I dislike how buying a maybe so-so card can potentially make a great card available for my opponent (of course vice-versa is possible, but the former creates more anti-fun for me than the latter generates in fun). I also can't really seem to grasp the flow of the game, which makes me a but more negatively biased towards this game.

A very big thumbs up about this game, is its pricepoint. It presents a solid game with a lot of replayability and potability, which I cannot say for a deckbuilder like Dominion or Nightfal

At first I wasn't very impressed by this game. I think the rules were a little fuzzy and I missed the importance of outposts as a defense. I revisited this and really enjoyed it.

Oh my, this is a lot of fun!

After the Dominion deception, which is rated so highly and didn't get into it at all, i thought LCG's weren't my thing. Star realm proves the opposite and is twice the game Dominion is for me. The simple design without losing game depth, but increases game flow makes it quite genius. 

It's portable, setup in a minute, is quick flowing, exciting and there are many ways to win. Even my GF loves it, which surprised me! We both don't particularly like Sci-fi themes, but this one gets to us. We really feel we're battling with space ships. Nice artwork!  

Only the manual isn't clear with some minor details, although i think we figured most out ourselves. 

Will buy more sets for sure :-)

I do feel the Blob faction is a tad overpowered compared to the others, the more we play it, the more it becomes a race for the Blob cards. The challenge is to win with other strategies though.

Score = 8/10 for 2-player duel.

It's super quick play with just 2 people,  but after the 4-player game we tried recently, play length seemed to grow more than double. Plus, it's a great value at $15 for a 2-player deck builder. But $30 - $45 for up to 6 players is a bit steep for this game IMO.

A very cool little game.  It is by no means deap, as you really only just draw cards and then play all of them with little importance to when.  And even the core deck building mechanic of the five purchasable cards is so random and limiting that any strategy will often crack when faced with the limited tactical purchase choices on any given turn.
All that said, the game is fun!  First, it's quick.  No fiddly, overly complex rules.  No difficult timing issues (well, it does matter when you play cards - some refer to your hand, which obviously doesn't include the cards you've already played - so timing makes a small part of play).  Obvious synergies. And second, it's cheap and portable.  Plus, with the Gambit expantion (arguably the least inovative expantion) you can even play solo and co-op.  
Very neat!

Very light deck builder where basically your only meaningful choice each turn is which card(s) to buy from a selection of 5. That card then goes into your discard pile and has no effect on play until you reshuffle and hope to draw it, which I think is a bad mechanic.

Given that strategic and tactical options are minimal, it's a decent game. I like the artwork, it's very cheap to buy, and has it's own charm in a light, fun way.

Excellent value for money. A good buy for young teens.

My friend was totally right to recommend this one - all that I want from a deck builder, no more, no less. Fast, balanced, never felt that the luck of the draw influenced play to much (especially since you are never going to play  only one game in a session :-)

It fills a similar niche as Magic the Gathering, by being a quick (15 minute) filler game, with direct combat in the style of a duel. The cheap price ($10) and lack of prep time makes it a lot better than any CCG for these purposes, especially since your opponent doesn't even need to bring anything. Just break this bad boy out at the lunch table and play with a friend, whether or not they've even heard of it, much less brought their own deck. Also, the graphic design as amazing.

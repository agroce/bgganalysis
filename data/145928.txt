Empire Engine is quite a fun little abstract game. It's perfect for on-the-go gaming. The gameplay is well-balanced, satisfying, and leaves very little to be desired. The games go by quick enough that you can reset and play again in no time. It definitely seems more like a mechanic that should be in a larger game, but manages to hold its own as-is.

As a filler game, this one works okay.  But that depends largely on if you like second-guessing games.  If you like and are good at knowing what your opponent(s) will do, this game will appeal.  If not - it can be pretty frustrating.  Game play is a bit like a double rondel.  You select your positions and based on what is selected, actions will be carried out.  Its a smart design, but the second guessing aspect is a tad too much for me (as in - I'm plain bad at it) and thus my rating may be a touch lower than the game deserves.

Played two three player games, would be interested in a four player. It scores highly for tension, especially when you have not defended yourself and are waiting to see if a neighbour attacks you. There's a degree of luck and bluffing here, but also a fair amount of deduction that helps narrow down the likely options of your opponents. Planning ahead is also important, which I didn't appreciate at first. In fact, there's quite a lot packed into such a small game.

This game turned out to be a lot of fun. It's so tiny yet there is so much to do. It's not easy to juggle those resources. It's difficult to setup your engine to do the things you need to do and at the same time guess what your opponent might do.

(Own and played the Ilya 77 redesign of the PnP)

It's a fun little game, but doesn't work so well 2-player as I imagine it does with more. Sooner or later you both end up with your gears rotated identically and the game turns into carefully trying to not look at whether your opponent has put their cards down yet because then it would be trivial to work out what they're doing... which is a bit off-putting.

   Picked up from a clearance sale, I had no idea what I was getting...  As far as micro games go, it is not bad - I heard it said on The Dice Tower, this game feels like it should be more a mechanic within a game.  I think that's a fair statement...  I would rank the game higher, but it always feels like it is over before it picks up any steam.

I bought a copy for a bunch of people on my team, as well as for extended team members.  I gave a copy to Jaffet and he immediately wanted to play it, and boy am I glad he did, because I know I got a great game for everyone.  What a fun game in a little package.  It plays super fast, but I always feel I have so much I can do on my turn.  I think future plays will add even more fun to the game, as well as extra strategy.  I missed one rule about end of game scoring (in that Jaffet never told me it) that will help with strategy in the end.  The extra 3 points for whoever has the most, in each colour.  This game will get played again and again, especially with non-gamers.  I also want to buy a whole load more to give away as gifts.

Clever little game! There is surprisingly a lot of depth and counter play even in a 2 player game.

Highly positive after trying it out for 3 games last night. The amount of deduction and back and forth is really amazing for a game with only 4 cards per player...

i can imagine it may get abit repetitive after awhile. since this is a micro game, it's ok though.

i recommend playing with 12 rounds. 8 is simply too short for a meaningful game.

You need to be perfectly aware of your neighbours' strategy as well as the current state of their gears to play this game properly. Only real complaint is that sometimes you can run out of a resource without being able to mitigate this, but other than that, no major complaints. Will have to try the factions to see how they work.

Reglas leidas...parece un filler interesante. Puntuaré tras la primera partida.
Tras tres partidas me parece un filler apañado para jugones. No es que sea excesivamente difícil sino que el tema de cubitos, ataques, defensas, mayorías, etc no lo hace idóneo para todos los públicos.
Está bien para jugar una partidita rápida de 15-20 minutitos ya que tiene algunas decisiones interesantes y algunos momentos de faroleo e intuición.

We actually played the Cold War edition which is not in the database.

Game mechanics are pretty easy once you get going.  Strategy will build the more that you play.  The concept is fairly quick and easy.  You can play with two players, but I can definitely see the advantage to having more.  

The play is a combination of strategy, bluffing, guess work, and luck.

Terrific 16-card game.   The game rules are straightforward and the game plays quickly.  There are some great opportunities to bluff and double bluff ("is he going to attack me or isn't he...well of course he is...but it is so obvious he'll surely know I'll defend myself so he can't possibly waste his turn attacking me...but if he does I'm screwed..."etc)  which makes the game hugely entertaining.

The game is best described using the aid of these cards:

[floatleft][ImageID=1738312][/floatleft][floatleft][ImageID=1738313][/floatleft]












Each player has two different gear cards which have various icons.  Each player is also given two rotation cards.  The goal is to have the most points.  Each round, in turn order each player will pick a rotation card face down (with the option to place a resource on it) and place it next to one of their gears.  In reverse turn order, players will play the other rotation card down (with or without a resource) next to their other gear.  Then, the rotation cards are revealed.  The gear cards are moved clockwise a number of times equal to the larger number if no resources were played or the lower number if a resource was played.  Actions are as follows:



[img]http://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1738314_md.png[/img]

Soldiers are considered resources and goods are also considered resources.  When you attack someone, if the attack icon is on your right/left gear, you're attacking the player to your right/left.  The game ends after a number of rounds.  Each resource (good/soldier/invention) in your score pile gives you 1 point.  Whoever has the most of a given resource, I believe, receives 3 bonus points.  

It's an interesting simultaneous action selection game, that you need to anticipate what people are going to do.  It basically fits in the micro-game genre where you have a game with some interesting decisions played in a short amount of time, with a minimal amount of components.  I don't think I would print it out for myself but I would play it again if asked.

A neat little game with simple rules.

Empire Engine has a cool idea and core mechanism behind it which feels like it should be part of a bigger or more complex game as opposed to a mini/filler game.  Hopefully AEG take the idea and make it into a larger, slightly more complex game.

Negative points for not having enough score cubes and having convoluted ways to get around it.  Swap the cubes for a pen and pad because it can becomes very fiddly.

I really like the concept behind this game. Your actions are on gears and you control how much they turn. It gives you enough information to try and guess what the other players are doing, which you can use to direct your own choices.

I got to try the original print and play and the current AEG version, and it's very interesting to see the differences in rules and features between the two. 

There definitely aren't enough cubes in the bag though!

After a video review: You are selecting actions by rotating a pair of gears as simultaneous actions selection. Then the actions makes you collect, use or score cubes. It does not play well at 2 players, so mostly a 3 to 4 player. The good think is that the game is very small and fast to play.

You'll notice a consistent theme that AEG is one of my favorite publishers, specifically for their tiny games that fit in a bag like this one. Don't get me wrong, I love sitting down for a 2-4 hour meaty game, but I find myself playing more games that I can stick in my pocket because you can play them anywhere. Though I've only played it once, it was almost immediately added to my wishlist. Plus, it was fun to get a private demo from Theta.

This is a great "Limited Options" kind of game. Basically, everyone has 2 gears that have 4 options on them each. The left wheel lets you attack your neighbor, add two soldiers to your reserve, add two goods to your reserve, or add a cube of your choice to your scoring pile. The right wheel let you attack your other neighbor, defend from 1 attack giving you a red cube in your score pile, add a blue cube to your score pile, and ship goods from your supply to your score. Each turn, you rotate one wheel once and the other twice. At the end of the game, you get 1 point for every cube in your scoring pile and 3 for every color that you have the most of.

The game is simple and the rules are very easy to teach and learn, but the mechanics are very very interesting and cool and the way the actions are selected are so much fun... love the hidden selection and revelation so that bluffing and double guessing are the name of the game!

It's great what can be done with just a set of cards... great game...

Just didn't like the lack of certain components for the game... there should be player screens to "hide" the safe resources...
There should also be a LOT more cubes of the different kinds, we were constantly running out of them and I think that's inadmissible!

Rondel: The Micro-game. 

Has a lot of the same double-think that other, similar games do such as Love Letter and Lost Legacy, but this feels much more Euro. Essentially you are moving around two Rondels to try and maximize your actions and score points. The game is very interesting, and I like how the lack of resources punishes those in the lead. My only real issues are that the game expects you to keep your score hidden without providing a viable way to do so, and the rules are a lot more convoluted than other micro-games. Gamers should have no problems getting into this one, but someone who has only played Love Letter and gateway games will most likely struggle early on. Overall I like the game quite a bit. I just worry that it won't come out as often as Lost Legacy will.

If you don't play a resource on a rotation card, then players know it's rotating once or twice, so you can make a call on whether a player is collecting resources this turn, turning those resources into VP's, intending to steal resources, or defending. If you add a resource to your rotation card, then players know it's staying as is or rotating thrice. Same type of call, but having the option makes the game, as there's a constant threat. As the rounds progress and start player rotates, you're either setting the tone for the other players (they can narrow your intentions down to 2) or if you're later in the turn order, you can react to the other players' possibilities. Anyway, it goes the right length, generates agonizing decisions and some groan/laugh along the way. It packs punch in a simple framework. That simplicity may not generate a huge amount of replay, but it's definitely engaging while playing.

A touch of rock/paper/scissors about the decision making, but with the optimal decision changing each turn based on current resources and not limiting future choices. Rating might be higher if I could get my head around how to do well.

Kind of rock-paper-scissors game - not very interesting mechanic, if thats the only thing in the game. Needs better components for giving the turn orders, right now, opponents can read your moves (or is it intentional?). Also the goods run out very fast, couple of bigger cubes should have been added (counting as 3x or 5x the good).

My friend Chris Marling's print and play microgame cleverly uses its 16 cards to give each player two action rondels and two cards to indicate how far each rondel will move on a turn. Give it a try!

Odd that there's no engine to build, in the Euro sense of the word.

Inoffensive blind action selection game. A bit fiddly visually as you want to see what your opponents to the left and right can do/have done before playing your card.

Cute, fast, and easy, but doesn't cry out to be played over and over again.

Rulebook made it seem wonky, but after a game the rules made sense. Played 5 games on 2 players, had fun. Well worth buying. One of the power cards (attack for 2 yellow) seemed very weak, but it might be better with more players? Interested in how the dynamics shift in multiplayer. Very important to keep the score hidden, we played that your own score was hidden as well (a bag each) and it felt like the game could have been quite flat if the score was open.

29-01-2015. Rated after 1 play. Confusing game, of two rotating gears. Each gear you rotate allows you one of several actions, those actions either protect your cubes or give you cubes from your opponent or the supply. 

The game is interesting, I am not sure if I fully comprehend it though. It felt very random, and I think playing with more than 2 players may make it more predictable.

The only serious reservation I have with this one is when playing with four, when you can't attack the person opposite you which can skew things.  In something like 7 Wonders this limitation isn't so bad because of the resource trading to offset things.  Here the options are more limited, and although the action selection mechanic is definitely clever, it does feel a little repetitive.

But frankly, given the constraints of the design, that's a minor niggle.

This feels more like a phase of a bigger game than a game that stand on it's own.  Options are too limited, the theme is to abstracted, and the fun just is not there.

Game is very short and I think that its length hides a very fundamental flaw with the game, namely that it's pretty repetitive. The round tracker basically shuts down the game at the point where everything starts to feel same-y.

The gear cards also only allow a maximum of 8 different configurations they can be in (as opposed to just 2 because of the cube thing), but generally you easily telegraph what you're going to do because your opponent only needs to deduce what you're going to do of the two possible configurations based on the part of the board state that they can see, and it's usually the one that makes more sense. Basically, once you figure out what's going on with the game, it's almost deterministic who's going to win. 

I think the game could benefit a lot from a third gear card like a 2/1 card (to complement the 1/0 and 2/3 cards) but still making it so that the player puts down two cards for their L and R engines. Following the 18-card restriction set by Goodlittlegames, I think they could've set up the P&P as a 2-player game with more gear cards for each and then allow them to print another copy to accommodate 4 players.

Got the AEG version of the game for the cubes, to play some of Goodlittlegames' other games, namely Pocket Imperium. Very frustrated by the card sizes that they used, which prevent me from sleeving the cards in a way that's adequate (76mm square cards so normal sleeves that fit it at way too big). Can't complain about packaging though since it's in as tight a package as is reasonable.

Who knew Chris had it in him? Empire Engine is a smart, quick little game that has you managing resources, trying to steal points from players, defending against attacks and playing with rondels. All in about 15 minutes and all with just 4 cards per player.

I can easily see a civ-type game bolted on to this and it making a fascinating 60-90 boardgame. It's well worth trying in it's current form though.

Update: The more I play this and the more impressed I am with it. It's a remarkably clever and stripped down design that delivers a lot of decisions in a really short play time. 

Rating up from 7.8 to 8.

Small tile rotation game with a nailed on steam punk theme. Actually quite a neat little package. Each turn you play out a movement tile/card to show how far you wish to rotate the left and right cogs you have in front of you. each rotation gives you a different action. ultimatley its how many resource cubes you can get into your scoring area. Neat

It's an okay game with few interesting ideas. It has surprisingly lot of confrontation and interaction, but in the end it goes down to kind of rock-paper-scissors, as in double-bluffing your opponent etc. We forgot the majority rule when playing. It's probably better with that.

Surprising amount of detailed back story for this micro clockwork production game. Perhaps this world development will be the basis for more games and expansions to come? Each round, programmed cards are played to rotate your two gears which determine your actions between production, salvage, deposit victory points, attack and defense. I like that the military interactive component is threatening but not overpowering. The game has a fresh feel with the cat and mouse of rotating your gears while anticipating your neighbors moves, and one action allows to keep your production or point scoring gear in the same position.

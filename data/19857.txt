RATING: 10
Love this. The mechanics can be a bit more difficult to get your head round but when you do, it's very rewarding. Comparisons with San Juan are well made but there are a lot more options to pursue and a lot more to take into account. Got a bit jaded with it after so many plays but now play with 3 sites rather than 2 (in a 2p game) and this has breathed all new life into the game and made me up it to a 10. (Nearly all games played 2p)

RATING: 9
I'm really loving this game. So far each game has developed so differently from each other, and there are so many choices to consider.  Scratches the itch for a civ. building game.  Surpasses the Catan Card game, our old favorite game for 2.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Scratches lots of itches; variable phase selection, random setup/card dealing. I agree with the late Tim Seitz; absolutely fantastic at 2p (but it's more bitter and spiteful than at larger player counts, and it's less likely to break in the same manner over and over like it seems to at higher counts), and I adore it at 3p as well. Something about Chudyk's designs seem to fall apart at higher counts. Either way, I'm honestly pressed to think of ever passing up a game if it's suggested in the 30+ times it's hit the table in 2015 alone, regardless of player count. This was the game that taught me proper "end game management" about when to end a game and how to decide that (and it's something that I find to be wonderful to tinker with, much like era C is in Indonesia); fear the merchant bonus... I do think GtR is a little more intuitive than Mottainai, and it's easier to pick up, even if there are some rough edges that Chudyk refines in his later games. Still a classic.

Two tries at playing this, we never made it through. I was interested in playing this to the end, but the others were not as enthusiastic about this. This happened both with casual gamers as well as with hardcore gamers. The low score results from the problem of not being able to get other people to finish this game. It may be great, but it seems like it isn't that accessible, at least for my crowd.

150909 Chudyk is a beast.  A minor Deity actually.

120929 Well obviously I've changed my mind on this one.  I think its the best of the one-card-many-uses type of game.  Its just a nice clean design.  A little painful to teach but unlike RfTG its not icontastic and doesn't end too soon, and unlike San Juan it doesn't seem to have some scripted paths through the game.  Its very chaotic but with a lot of room for skill.  The only caveat is don't learn this game with 5P -- that's a bad idea.  But otherwise it works well 2-5.

120927 I can see why it has cult status.  But I need to play a few more times before I know for sure whether I want it.

[COLOR=#FFFFFF][BGCOLOR=#FF9933][b]aaj's FAVORITE TABLEAU BUILDER[/b][/BGCOLOR][/COLOR]
My copy is an entirely custom-printed Black Box edition. Every card icon was redrawn, along with the entire card layout, and then reprinted on Printer Studio's 310 GSM linen finish. I've also had a custom box made and made redesigned player boards at the Game Crafter. 

I like to call Glory to Rome a delicately-balanced masterpiece. Everything is so tight and well-put-together that this game really couldn't be played any other way. 

First off, let's talk about the cards. It's incredible that every card has multiple functions, that there are six types of cards in the game, each with several unique types of buildings. It's incredible that a card can be a material, a client, or a building. But more than that, it's incredible that the game is balanced through all this chaos. 

See, Glory to Rome is a tableau builder. As you complete buildings, you gain new special abilities that make your actions better, or let you break the rules a bit, or let you interferer with other players. That's crazy, and in any other game it'd be horribly broken! But in Glory to Rome, where everyone has the potential to build a crazy building (maybe even build a crazy building that nerfs your own crazy building!) the balance is maintained. Everyone is racing towards the same goal, and the end result is an immensely satisfying tableau builder where you all gradually branch out, pursuing the same goal in a million different ways. 

But secondly, this game firmly solidifies the lead/follow mechanic as one of my favorite in all of gaming ([thing=68425][/thing] is another notable example). Downtime between turns is no problem, even with five players, because you're following every one of their actions, accomplishing things even when it's not your turn. 

Sometimes, you find yourself silently (or audibly) begging with someone to lead that Craftsman because if they lead a craftsman you'll be able to set yourself up on your own turn to build a chain of two buildings. Or maybe they need to Patron so you can hire that client you desperately need...and then they don't, and you wail and curse. Or they do, and you jump up and cheer. "Player interaction"? Glory to Rome has that in spades, and more. 

And finally, this is a game that's willing to subvert its own rules. Every role can be specialized, and can be a viable path to victory. New players will often call out the Merchant role as overpowered, but there are plenty of tools in the other roles as well. Not only that, Glory to Rome provides two alternate ways to win: one instantly, without counting points (Forum/Forum Romanum), and another shiver-inducing instant end, that still forces you to count points and crown a victor (Catacombs). There are so many ways to play within, and even subvert, the delicate structure of this game. 

Glory to Rome has  metagame in spades. With experienced players, there's no game I'd rather play, and there's no game I'd rank above it in my collection. Who knew that a couple hundred cards could do so much? 

This is my forever game, till death do us part, so help me God. It's a shame that this game isn't available at retail, because my #1 game is unmatched, even by its 'spiritual' successor, Mottainai. And I'm rubbing salt in your wound by trumpeting a game that can't even be purchased. Still. Find this game, play this game, and learn to love this game. It's worth it!

I wish I had of bought the original version many years ago. To think I was missing out on this great game for that long make me sad. 

But now I've got it and it is an amazing game. Some people do not like it 2 player but I do. although with more it is even better.

Because of this game I also picked up Innovation which was another game by the same designer which looked (graphically) very average. I'm so glad I did it's also a great game.

RATING: 6
Big caveat - have only played two 4 player games so far, and I really wanted to love this game. The theme is great, I love the artwork and the mechanics are sound. But I've been left underwhelmed both times, partly because of just how long it's taken to play. The first game ended on sites, the second on the orders card deck. It may well be that with more experience we can close the game down more quickly but both games over ran their welcome somewhat. We are a pretty slow group and that must have something to do with it.

The outrageously strong card combos are something I'm not sure about - in the second game I came from a slow start to be thinking with a hand size of +4, getting the effects of marble buildings before completing them, and being able to use merchants as any role and having my clients perform actions twice. It took me a fair while to get to this stage but once I did it was pretty much lights out, and I guess the other players should have submitted to my rule rather than have the game run on to the bitter end.

So far I have to say that I prefer San Juan as it seems to be to be better balanced and more disciplined as a game. Clearly GtR has a very strong following so we need to give it some further table time. I would add that my impression wasn't helped by our finishing up with a game of the Bottle Imp, which for us offered more fun and sharp decision taking in a fraction of the time. I will however be interested to read more of other people's views on GtR and may hopefully revise my rating upwards with more plays.

Glory to Rome is a fascinating beast.  It's a little hard to wrap your head around the systemic flow at first, but during your first game it should dawn on you how each role interacts with the others (though some role pairings, like Craftsman and Merchant, don't interact at all).

Glory to Rome is, first and foremost, a game of synergies.  It's about constructing buildings that give you special powers and leveraging those special powers together with other buildings to do wonderful things.  Some buildings you'll look at and say "That's lame, why would I want to build that" only to see it pair with some other cards and be blown away by how it actually plays out.

Due to the impact of these synergies, each game plays out differently and has a different feel to it.  You think different thoughts and approach the game in different ways based on the cards you have built.

You're also very concerned about what your opponents have built and how you might possibly work to counter it.

It's a fun and thoroughly engaging game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A clever but unintuitive rule set with a massive number of card interactions made this feel potentially unbalanced after a first play. The theme doesn't really come through either. However, the game is fast and a fairly interesting puzzle. Better than the re-worked Uchronia game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Glory to Rome is a great role selection/tableau building game with familiar elements.  It reminds me a lot of San Juan, and a little of Eminent Domain.  Similar to San Juan, you construct buildings to get their bonuses.  However, in Glory To Rome, you can't just pay for the buildings with any cards.  Instead, you must collect and use specific materials.  Also, similar to Eminent Domain, players can "follow the leader", and "boost" their roles.  It will probably replace both in my collection.

I can completely understand why a great number of people are thrilled with this one. It's a game where you can endlessly (?) explore the combination of cards. The mechanics are interesting (although I can see shades of similar things in Innovation) and run fairly smooth. But for me, it isn't the kinda game I long to play. Still, I'll keep it around because for this type of game, it's very well put together. And hey, I *do* like the Black Box version just fine. Very clean.

Fantástico y barato juego de cartas!, Profundas estrategias de gestión de roles, la mano y la pila de descartes. Es un juego muy bueno, pero como pasa con este autor, pueden salir unos combos que no son ni normales y que le dan a ese juegador la partida. El cartón de tablero podría ser más grueso/grande, necesitas ponerle algo encima para que no se mueva y poder poner debajo las cartas conforme las reglas del juego. Dos variantes, Imperio (la anterior y más dura) y República. Han sacado una miniexpansión que habria que verla, pero 10€ es cara para el material que trae, para variar.

An interesting card game with some fun combo-making.  Reminds me a quite a bit of Race for the Galaxy, and I prefer Race between the two.  This one feels like randomness plays more of a factor.  The game does play fast, though, which increases my tolerance for the randomness.

Additionally, Glory to Rome has more direct conflict than I generally prefer, though interestingly my group seems to rarely use the direct attack (Legionary) role, and the game doesn't seem to play any worse for it.

Update 6/11/15: Having played a few more times, my interest in the game has declined.  In my last game, I built a total of two buildings and yet won handily on the strength of cards in my vault.  Throughout the game I felt like I was doing very little and was way behind, which ended up not being the case.  It was a very unsatisfying win.  It could be argued my opponents spent too much time building engines and not enough time going for points, but the fact that I won the game without much of an engine was a turn-off for me.  I still like the game alright, but it's not one I'll ever ask to play.

The Black Box edition was our first exposure to GtR, and our first two games were met with very positive feedback!  There's obviously a great deal here, but it wasn't as subject to as much slowness as Innovation from constantly reading everyone's cards that you're not familiar with yet.  I expect this to see more play soon.

This might be the best Euro-ish game that I have ever played.  This has some similarity to [thing=8217][/thing] and [thing=28143][/thing], only this one is more enjoyable in many ways.  I like San Juan, but wish it was a little more flexible and maybe a little more complicated.  RftG tries to be a great game and tries to fill the gaps in SJ, but fails miserably, because it almost always becomes a race to grab VP chips.  Both games are multi-player solitaire games where the players compare scores.

This game is more interactive: You get the chance to take cards from your opponent.  You also manage the pool of cards in the middle, to keep him from getting cards he needs.  Instead of just being "luck of the draw," there is hand management involved, which creates more player interaction.

There are also buildings that you can build that can potentially change the victory conditions, so while your buddy may be building a zillon VPs, you can play a building, collect all roles in your clientelle, and score the automatic victory.  There is far more complexity and versatility than Race.  It is just a far better game, overall.  If you play RftG, do yourself a favor and upgrade to this.  You won't be disappointed.

Very fun!  Mix of many different elements - building construction, role selection (but not limited), hand management, resource management, and more.

Downgraded from 9 to 8 (5/01/08).

I like this one a lot.  Many strategies and directions, lots of cards, interesting dynamics.  I just think the Craftsman strategy is a bit *too* strong.  If you can obtain a number of Craftsman patrons and abuse them, it can get a little ridiculous.

Rating may change with additional plays.  I could be at a plateau, though I have yet to see hints that my impressions are flawed or erroneous.  Even so, an excellent game that I strongly recommend.

GLORY TO ROME!

I'd rather play: RACE FOR THE GALAXY (roles - combos)

To me, this game now feels dated. This might seem strange, given how chaotic it is and how quirky it can be, but I don't think it has the depth people claim. Really, the building powers are not pervasive, and you're playing the pool to gain advantage in key client combinations. That's not bad in itself, but I don't think it is elegant like Race For The Galaxy or genuinely creative like Innovation.

I can't believe how far Eminent Domain rips off the Following mechanism. People can talk about En Garde/Flash Duel, but really EmDo isn't even it's own game! 


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Takes a couple games just to get the basic flow down. That leaves plenty of games to get acquainted with building combos, which are much more varied and interesting than in the comparable San Juan or Race for the Galaxy.
The game does feel clunkier than San Juan, and the convoluted rulebook doesn't help. But underneath is a gem. And I like the art...apparently I'm insane.

A fascinating, offbeat, indie-developed card game.  Not so professional as RftG, Dominion, or the superb Blue Moon and Jambo.  Lots of very neat (and surprisingly balanced) building powers that keep you coming back.

Unfortunately, over time my initial love has turned into sadness.  The card powers ARE cool, the pool IS a really neat interaction mechanism, and this is (while it lasts) more FUN than RftG or Dominion.  Unfortunately, the scoring system leads to annoying play (and in 2p at least favors whoever happens to draw more blue cards), keeping track of all your own and opponents' powers is a nightmare, the rules are slightly overly complex, etc.  It's flawed enough (ignoring the graphics) to not measure up to its promise, after enough plays to see what's wrong.  Sigh.

Fun 3-player game reminded me of San Juan. At first, we thought there was only one sure path to win by building tons of buildings and using this card that lets you take a Craftman action for each earned VP (can't remember the name of it), since my sister did it three times in three games and trounced us. However, in our last game, I focused on the exclusively the Vault mechanism and scored 48 points to win by a large margin. Can't wait to try the next game with different strats!

UPDATE: Played with 5 players and this game does hold up! It's still relatively fast-paced and easy for new players to pick up (a new player won!) - the strategy is slightly different with 5 though! Raised rating to 8. 

UPDATE: Got the black box edition as part of a Kickstarter campaign, but box have severe bubbling!

Hints of San Juan/Race for the Galaxy come to mind when playing this but I think this game has more going on and probably requires more thought to play well. I especially enjoy the balancing you have to do with each card in your hand given that each can be used for a variety of things. After one play I rate this one an 8 but it'll likely move up with more plays. Definitely requires a playing under your belt to get a feel for all aspects of the game. The potential for potent card combos seems endless. The fact that it plays fairly quickly is a big plus. Fun game.

Great Game. Played the German version twice. Multifunctional card game. Most cards are very powerful and you have to decide which one you play as an action or which one you build. 
Unluckily the game is not on the market.

The many different options and building combos in this game are a lot of fun. You can never predict how the game will unfold or what buildings will end up in your hand. There is definitely an art to surfing the chaos in Glory to Rome. That can be aggravating. But it's neat!

There is still strategy in the way you play. And even if your opponent(s) find some crazy broken combo. You can too! Probably.

Note: I like the Republic rules and cards a LOT better than the Imperial. That's my preference and what my rating is based off of.

Fantastic multi-use card game that's sort of similar to Race for the Galaxy - role selection and cards serving as costs, buildings, and VP in some way shape or form.  I find Race the more elegant game, since it's got less moving parts and the game scales a lot nicer into the endgame (discounts and cardflow + goods for VP rather than giant client-powered actions and cards to vault), but pool control is a really interesting thing that other games of its type don't have.  It plays particularly well as a shorter, heavier game seating 3-5 which is a very nice niche to have.

Update 7/23/14: Revised rating down slightly after playing a pile of games with the Imperium variant and burning through the "new game" impression.  It's a very good game, but the randomness still bothers me a bit - you really need to get certain cards at the right time for a lot of strategies to work, and if people aggressively skip their turns it can lead to people just getting shut out for a while.

Update 8/1/14: Rating revised back up, we were derping on the rules for players skipping their turn.  Ignore my previous comment!

UPDATE: I think I like the power combinations and gameflow of Innovation a touch better ... it just seems smoother and more streamlined, despite the chaos ... but there are a lot of interesting combos to build, and a lot of ways to really boost your engine (patrons, merchants, etc.). A craftsman patron does, indeed, seem strong, though.

--------------------------------------------------------

It's pretty hectic and actually takes a lot of table space. I don't think I like it more than Innovation (though the two are substantially different) due to some recordkeeping and how much longer it feels like it plays. However, this has somewhat more strategy than Innovation. It plays longer and is less swingy; you at least know what "broken" building somebody is trying to build several turns before it comes out.

The clientele / piggybacking thing can be severely limiting, but I think that's just a nice part of the strategy.

An OK game of the San Juan/Race for the Galaxy school.  Presents a fair few options, but seems overly reliant on the luck of the draw.  I wonder how thoroughly this was playtested as some cards appear over-powered.  Card quality is adequate. I find the artwork a bit juvenile.

Interesting game. I like the multiple use cards. I guess I'm left wondering if it's really possible to specialize -I tried to do my own thing and realized I had to do some of the same things as everyone else in order to build the capacity to do my own strategy. Hard to explain. I would play again, although the colorful art hurt my eyes.

Initial impressions after a short game. Very interesting card game. I really like the role selection part. Each card can be used either as a role, as a building or as a materal. The game is very exciting and interactive. Lots of buildings, each of them with unique abilities. The rules are a bit complex but after a few turns everything just clicks. The (old) english edition has poor artwork and very bright colours. I think that Glory to Rome might be a card game that can actually stand as equal to Race for the Galaxy. I need more plays in order to explore the game better.

Really like this card game. Reminiscent of RFTG. Took a few games to start to get the hang of it. Lots of different strategies to be aware of. Lots of depth and lots of game to explore.

RATING: 5
We played one five-player game of the newest version and this was just so painfully boring to me... The game play is repetitive and inflexible.  Get off to a bad start due to a bad card draw and watch everyone else play the rest of the game - especially as the five player game has so bad a runaway leader issue that is so bad that I'd call this broken.  Other players complete buildings with great powers while you suffer from bad card draws and their game just gets easier and easier relative to yours for the remainder of the game.  This lost me in a hurry - as soon as I saw the runaway leader issue.  I just played out the string waiting for it to end.  With apologies to those who like this game, to me, this game has NO redeeming characteristics whatsoever, and put me off playing any more games for the rest of the evening.  I just had no enthusiasm for playing anything after playing this.

Far deeper than it appears at first. The mechanics are a bit complex, and it has the downside of really requiring a dumbed-down training game to get new players into the flow. 

After only a handful of plays, I feel like I'm just getting the hang of it, and every game I discover new synergies between buildings. The small hand size creates a large luck factor, as you have to adapt your strategy to the cards you see earliest in the game. Definitely want to play more of this one.

My favorite card game.  Fairly easy to set up. Simpler to explain than Race for the Galaxy and has considerably more player interaction.  Though there are some strategic elements, it is a highly tactical game.  Rewards the ability to spot and execute card combinations.  Despite the potential wild swings in fortune, it is in fact far less luck driven than some believe.

Combinatorial insanity, but not necessarily in a way I enjoy. "Exponential escalation" doesn't really do this game justice--it's nuts. I believe that this design is so focused on shutting down other players' strategies and attempting to abruptly swing the end-game that it's not entirely to my taste.

Rating based on one play:  Steep learning curve and so many things going on at once, each card can be used in 3 separate ways and the combinations, plus keeping track of a strategy can be difficult to manage.

Most likely my favorite card game of all time.  So clever and strategic, you have to pay attention to everything that is happening.  It really is the perfect example of simple design and enormous complexity and strategy.  Also I love the graphic design of the black box edition - I have no idea why it gets a bad rap.  Something about the BB edition just feels so classic.  If one day a thousand years from now they have a museum exhibit of table top games from the early 21st century, the black box edition of Glory to Rome should be in it.  I believe this game is THAT good and THAT classic.

After playing just a few games I see there's a lot of strategy left unexplored.  In fact this is extreme strategy, almost tiring.
The game play is relatively easy but there's a lot to think about as you go.  
Massive replayability as each game feels like it only covers 5% of what is possible.
With so much variation there are the odd games when the cards can seem quite imbalanced.

A really messy yet wonderful experience where strategy and tactics is blended with a good bit of chaos.  The amount of options available each turn is tremendous as each card can be used and will be evaluated on a variety of means (should I use it for its role?, building power?, etc.).  Is portable and gives a lot for its relatively cheap cost.  Artwork sucks, but the depth found in the game should help you get past that!

Nov 2012: An interactive card game about denying your opponents the resources they need while accumulating them yourself.  I like that there are several ways to achieve and advantage--it seems like most of them can work as part of a winning strategy.  The variety in the buildings is nice: yes, they can be incredibly powerful, but at the point that someone has built a "broken" combo, the game is essentially over (and thankfully, the game is actually over not long later).

A lot like Race for the Galaxy. It's a similar enough game to feel like having played one gives me more insight into the other, but each has its own problems. Glory to Rome seems to have over-emphasized the value for sold goods in an effort to make the strategy viable. It seems impossible to win without participating in the whole merchant thing somehow, which means that some games I've felt forced to play in a way I didn't really want to. Oh well.

Tentative rating based upon one play,  Rating possibly could go up.  I usually don't take a shine to card games, but this is just a really clever card game where the theme really fits.  Also the Roman + building an economic engine are 2 positives for me.  On the other hand play is not really intuitive, so my recommendation would be the first time you play it, to play 2 games back to back.  Some people complain about the comic book art, and that was my first impression, but after 15 minutes you don't notice it, and it seems to fit.  Game owner made the comment that the game actually seems to go faster with 4 than with 3.

The 60 minute play time seems to be right on.

From 10000m, this is poker without the betting.  It amounts to getting the best patterns of cards via decisions of draws (admittedly pumping through a deep lifecycle of cards).  The possible player states ('hands') is much much greater than poker, but once a handle on the combos is attained, the decision making is basically just choosing what end state to shoot for given some notion of odds of getting there.

Note that it is the chaos level that degenerates GtR to this level, in spite of the fancy card lifecycle and player interactions.

But this is far far more complex in state than poker.  Which in the end amounts to learning curve to get to the same game.  If you are into discovery with a card game, then this is probably good.  If not, like for me, this is not good.

Finally, poker /does/ have betting as a critical major value add, which GtR does not have.  Hence this is far inferior to poker.

Innovation launched Carl Chudyk into my favorite designers; Glory to Rome cemented him there. This game is a masterpiece of overloaded components. Cards are actions, bonus actions, buildings, materials, and points. The game is about transforming these cards between those states. That hits all of my buttons.

I'm not particularly good at the strategy to the game yet, and it seems that the game is a bit more amenable to long-term thinking than Innovation.

Oh, and the roles system is a great example of player interaction done right.

Carl Chudyk manages to make games that feel unbalance yet be balanced at the same time. And Glory to Rome is no exception. This is a card-driven engine-building game where certain combos can quickly lead to insurmountable engines. But through knowing the cards/options of other players, it also manages to feel controllable. And compared to some of his other designs (Innovation, Mottainai), the game allows more time to develop one's engine, which I find quite satisfying. 

Really, the biggest issue with this game is learning about how the game flows and how the cards link/combo together. If you play it once, I can see the game feeling like a chaotic mess. But with multiple play, it really opens up into something quite interesting.

Tableau building with loads of different cards doing loads of different stuff, there's no point trying to pay attention to what other players are doing because they'll have different cards in their tableau which you won't be able to read from across the table. If you're new to the game this means that you'll have literally no idea what opponents can do because you know nothing about their cards. This a genre of game I just don't get on with. I gave Roll for the Galaxy a 5, and the same for Race for the Galaxy and the same for this, marked down by one point because of the non-existent attempt at art work.

Played this one waaaaay late, so I am guessing I lost the 'wow' train for this game since there are nowadays so many more games using its mechanism. Nevertheless, this is a cute game, love the iconography of this edition vs the one of the black box edition. Gamewise, it plays fluently with not so many rules, apart from the extra rules that come as abilities of each building you complete, which is not that tough (no need for a MSc degree here).

After two games I was warily optimistic. After a few more I worried about balance. After 15 games, I considered this a great title, we often play 2-3 times in a sitting (along with other games). Numerous paths to victory. I dislike the artwork, and think that the game could use a bit more polishing (errata and final development). But still very good.   Now that the second edition is out, I've upped my rating to a '10.' The new edition tightens a few of the cards up, and adds out of town sites. See my review.

(I should note that the second edition is the I.V. edition. I haven't tried the kickstarter version).

Számomra az általam igen kedvelt San Juan c. játékot idézte - felturbózott mechanizmusokkal, végeláthatatlan kombinációs lehetőségekkel. 
Ötletes és tetszetős a kártyák sokoldalú felhasználásának módja, az interakció mértéke.
Továbbá a magyar kiadás (köszönet érte PaYa-nak) karikatúra szerű rajzain a játék holtidejében - ami nem sok van - lehet mosolyogni.
A játékban az nyer, aki az épületek leghatékonyabban (néha leggonoszabban) működő sorozatát képes a maga szolgálatába állítani.
Valószínűleg Róma újjáépítése 3-4 játékossal válik igazán élvezetessé, de 2 játékos esetén is jó szórakozást nyújt.
Mivel a sok-sok lehetőség állandóan újdonságot mutat - egyenlőre megunhatatlannak tűnik.
Emiatt persze a kiegyensúlyozottság sem erőssége a játéknak... - ezt fogadd el ha játszol vele.
A pontszám több játékossal történő játék kipróbálása után még emelkedhet.
Update: 3 játékossal 7.5

I played the game 3 times in one day and found the game to be fun enough.  Although, I did win 2 of the 3 games so that colors my feelings towards the game a bit.  I just find that Race for the Galaxy to be superior in terms of balance.  You'll find in Glory to Rome that the powerful cards are no more expensive than cards that are not as great.  I find that due to this, Glory to Rome is much more "swingy" since you can pull of gnarly combos a lot sooner than you can in Race for the Galaxy.  There is a nice build up for Race for the Galaxy compared to Glory to Rome.

Well, this game is the ugliest piece of cardboard ever created. But it is also a very brilliant, entertaining and fun piece of game design: the mechanic of leading plays is a couple years ahead similar titles, and the games are full of interesting choices. With the right artwork it could easily place on BGG top30.
This game is definitely better with larger number of players: the simultaneous play with almost no downtime is a great feature, and the huge swings in fortune are so much fun!!

The italian edition has better artwork than the I.V edition (not exactly unbelieavable, I guess...) while retaining the funny theme. The cards are bigger in size (like those in 7 Wonders) and the players' mini-boards are made from thick cardstock.

Initial Impression: To begin with, I prefer the original cartoony artwork, as I believe it adds a certain lighthearted character to the game. Although I haven't played this game enough, knowing the cards really benefits the experienced players. I find the card manipulation "fiddly" and the building powers can really swing the game quickly. I do think the role selection mechanism is well implemented though.

A really solid game, but you must pay attention to what others are building. Had to make a house rule that new buildings needed to be announced and explained to others around the table, which was a little annoying. Also, your long-term plans can be completely stopped by someone card hoarding, which means you may need to draw on several consecutive turns. Overall, I think it's Chudyk's best game, but still a little random for my taste.

RATING: 3
Pre-game impressions weren't good. What seemed to be an overtly complicated card game with garish graphics soon revealled itself to be quite a tactical little game where you had to choose your own approach to victory whilst trying not to benifit your neighbours.

Some buildings do seem extremely powerful and when played in conjunction with others seem unbeatable. Here the early card draw is crucial and the rub of the cards could spin against you but not a bad 60 minutes once you get your head around the rules.

Second Play: The rub of the cards does seem to stear the action and if you don't draw decent buildings then you will be sunk. Early builds and client expansion seems essential to benifit from client follow ons. One more play to be sure but I think there may be far more luck than skill with this one. (Rating reduced)

Third Play: My comments for play 2 are only repeated and emphasised. The rub of the cards drawn especially in the early game utterly sets the success of the game. Its clear that certain players relish the randomness but the experience just strikes me as futile. Time to put this up for trade or sale.

Fourth Play: How did I forget I disliked this so much! Same again, the luck of the card draw utterly dictates what happens. Without clever buildings to build or the materials to build them you are in a vacuum. Sure materials in the vault is the path to victory but if you can't get materials in the stockpile you aren't going anywhere. I can see no strategic opportunities here if you don't get the cards you need. You might as well roll dice. Rating dropped again. Please shoot me if you ever see me at a table with this again.

Random thoughts:

-This game is much more fun when playing using building abilities. Teaching games without them are OK but not the kind of games I'd prefer.

-Teaching it is not easy, and some people seem to have trouble grasping the game, but I think it's not that hard.

-Every different action is powerful and you should try to diversify and not concentrate on just one.

-The people I play with tend to veto this game :(

At first I didn't like it and thought that innovation was way better.
Now I really like it and I think it's a fun game.
I still prefer innovation though.

And... okay, this might not be the best looking game ever, but the bright colors serve their purpose and I really don't mind at all.
Criticizing how this game looks seems to have become some kind of meme of some sort. 
I'm sure I wouldn't like it as much with serious art (although better cartoony art might be a good idea... or at least a consistent style across the cards)... the ridiculous combos and overpowered cards almost demand cartoony art.

I rarely give out perfect scores to games, but this game doesnt get a perfect score either. but its still a great game. In this game you use the bodies of craftsmen, merchants, legionaries etc. to build glorious structures for the glory of rome (see what i did there). you can build such wonders as to rival the works of the great augustus...and still be beaten by a compulsive hoarder of bricks.
 This game can be hard to grasp initially.. i know it was for me and rin and we're basically geniuses so good luck to the rest of you. The key paradigm shift is that people can be buildings and bricks at the same time in a weird superposition of states. basically these are quantum cards. not for small children as you need a grasp of quantum mechanics to play this game.

Game has a pretty steep learning curve but once it clicks it is just so much fun. The game runs smoothly and the cleverly designed cards facilitate the 'one card represents lots of different things' very well. A lot of the cards seem overpowered when you first see them and really insane combo's can be created. But surprisingly this does not break the game. It just adds to the fun factor. It can be a bit luck dependent but that does not really bother me. Neither does the artwork I've heard so many people complain about. Very clever cardgame that could become a favorite.

As with Tichu, this is one for which I've felt compelled to keep upping my rating. This is a great game that seemingly just gets better and better with each play.

This used to be my top pick for "hidden gem that most BGGers would love if they knew about it," before it became pretty well-known over the past few years.

This game is very dynamic.  I wonder if my rating might be a bit lower because, in my two plays, I've been a newbie playing with people who know the game.  Both games finished with a clearcut winner and four of us bunched up with few points.

I've adjusted my rating down again after another play.  I can see that this is still a very interesting and dynamic game.  However, as a casual player of the game with experienced players, it is a joke.  I like all of the things going on, but it is a game I feel needs to get played a number of times before you can really participate intelligently.  I won't play it that many times so I am less interested in playing it.

My favorite card game.  G2R is extremely high on depth. It plays fast, has lots of player interaction and tremendous replay value. Rules and mechanical elegance are very good, but not as sublime as San Juan/RftG. On the other hand, the roles are quite different than PR, SJ or RftG. And the building abilities are much more interesting than either SJ or RftG.

One playing.

I was not a fan of how the available cards in the pool disappeared between turns. It made it nearly impossible to set up my next turn with my current action. The game felt more reliant on drawing the right cards at the right time than [i][gameid=8217][/i] or [i][gameid=28143][/i], which people have compared it to.

It also felt a little long for what it is and the artwork and graphic design interfere with the information on the cards. It can be hard to distinguish the different cards of the same color from each other.

I'd play it again, but was very happy to be able to immediately sell my copy after playing.

Very fun engine building game.  It goes far whackier towards the end than I expected - the engine can really start to go out of control, creating what appear to be huge swings.  But I don't think they're really that huge, it looks like the combos are just big, not necessarily the points.  I like it.  Not nearly as confusing as I thought it would be.  It does feel like the Merchant/Vault is key, letting someone get those bonus points unchallenged is a sure way to lose.  It may be too dominant, we'll see.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A lot of game in a small package and a short playing time (after that first play). A little like Puerto Rico, with the roles and the buildings with their different powers. But unlike PR, you're forced to take a different approach each time, as you can only work with the cards you get.  SO the luck of the draw becomes a feature, rather than a problem.  Different paths to victory also add to the depth and replayability of the game.

My group has played Glory to Rome more than any other game this year (2006).  Along with Caylus, my favorite game from 2005.

Played once and really deserves several more plays.

Not sure one play is enough to work out the strategy.

Redesigned black box version is a 'classy' design!  I missed the kickstarter by a day, so I purchased mine new (for twice as much btw) from a game store in Canada; hard to find game!  

Game had trouble coming to market and it seems there were a lot of unnecessary reactions from some of the game community that I think could have been a bit more tempered.  I appreciate the difficulties making a game and kickstarter is inherently a little bit of a bet. Lets hope the worst of the comments came from a minority in the gaming community. I heard the publisher, Ed Carter, fell on some hard times and I hope him the best in the future.

My game was shrink wrapped new, but opening it I discovered the box had glue bubbles lifting up small bumps under all the surfaces. Honestly, I do wish my game box didn't have bubbles all over it; but the game still plays. :) But the premium esthetic is lost.

**** Not all game boxes had this defect.  But if you are curious, I posted images of my box in the image section of the game.

One play incomplete... must get a better rating with more experience.

*update*

Wrong impression, it got worst with second try. Some cards powers seems to be unbalanced. Until today I don't know what I think about this game. Broken?

*update*

Played for the 3rd time, I'm starting to see things, and those things looks very good... I want to play more.

*update*

Purchased, played for the 4th time and traded away without regrets. 

This is not my kind of game, the cards are dramatically unbalanced. Some times, you can get a good starting combo and win comfortably, then the following game nothing works.

One of my favourite card games. I mainly played it with 2 players so I don't know how it scales for more. It's fast and engaging. Thanks to the follow mechanic there is very little downtime and the feeling is that there is always your turn. It also isn't simple solitaire, there is common pool of cards and legionary role that add player interaction. I'd play it any time.
Also the Polish edition has really nice art compared to the original. It's a pleasure to play.

Fun game.  Reminiscent of San Juan and Race for the Galaxy.  Construct buildings for their benefits, hire workers to mooch off of the actions of opponents, race to build the required number of VP to win.

Now played this 3 times and it's gone from "looks like the sort of game I'd like if I can just get over the learning curve" to "yuck, don't want to play this again".

Learning curve on this one is large, and having lots of special cards that mix up the rules and combinations that seem very powerful just makes it worse - not good in a clearly strategic game. Definitely not one where you can bumble along - early actions are just as important as late game ones. 

Overall I just found it not much fun - luck of the draw and powerful combinations made it an exercise in frustration.

Cartoon art is the final nail ...

This is a more sophisticated version of "San Juan" or "Race for the Galaxy - Basic." It takes a bit longer to set up, takes a lot of table area, and has almost too much going on for casual play. Especially with 4 or 5 players it seems unbalanced. Last match during the last 6 or 7 rounds the starting player never changes, depending on his buildings....

While I can't even suggest playing this at home, I had a blast playing it with my local gaming group.  While it can be compared to San Juan and Race for the Galaxy, it feels much deeper than both.  I'll need to play this a bunch more times before I have a good enough feeling to describe it.

After a few more plays, I still enjoy the game and I won't say no to playing it, but I probably won't suggest playing it.  While the card distribution is always an issue in card games, for some reason it seems like more of an issue in this one.  Maybe it's just the luck of the draw, but I never seem to see Merchants showing up.

Es un juego en el que cada jugador participa en la reconstrucción de roma, después del incencio de Nerón (creo). Es un juego de cartas. Cada jugador tiene un tablero y las cartas se van ubicando a uno u otro lado del tablero. Según su ubicación las cartas tienen una función diferente. Cada carta es a la vez, un personaje, un edificio, un tipo de material, un valor de influencia y un valor de tesoro. 

En cada turno, un jugador juega una carta de personaje (roles). Cada personaje hace una cosa. El resto de los jugadores, pueden decidir si van a jugar el mismo rol, o pasan y simplemente roban cartas (piensan). Se pueden ir acumulando clientes (roles ya jugados que te dan derecho a aprovecharte de roles de otros jugadores sin gastar cartas), metiendo materiales al almacen, consiguiendo tesoros, o construyendo edificios. Los edificios acabados otorgan funciones especiales e influencia. La influencia aumenta el límite de cartas de roles y de tesoro que puedes tener en el tablero. 

El juego es interesante. Es necesario jugar más partidas para valorar con más justicia, pero de momento la primera impresión es muy positiva. Empieza con un 7.5 y quizás vaya subiendo..

Sin duda recomendable. Sin tener mucho que ver.. el juego puede estar a la altura de 7 wonders, por ejemplo.

So now I own this and after swapping out the box with something a bit more sturdy and a lot less likely to spill, it gets brought in the 'small games bag' quite frequently.

What's frustrating is that I showed it to one group quickly, using the introductory rules (half the deck, no building powers) and now at least one of those players indicates that it's just not that interesting.

So sad.

Rome demands you play this game!
The card interactions and strategies in this game can be a little complicated and unwieldy at first, and it has a very steep learning curve the first time through. Once you get past that hurdle, however, this is a very elegant and entertaining game with very deep strategy requiring you to not only work on developing your own strategy, but forcing you to keep a close eye on the other players' as well.
The artwork is bright and entertaining, and each card contains a classical quote relating to the card's name and function, which just adds flavour and fun to the game.
Anyway, if you can get past the initial complexity of the game, it's a lot of fun.

My girlfriend actually plays it...... This is a game that allows you create ridiculous, super over powered engines that dominate your opponents. When you learn the game, countering super engines and being able to pull off a win is where the real satisfaction kicks in. 

If you do purchase, laminate the player mats, and sleeve the cards it'll be a game you'll play for years. And if you want to go all out make player mat stands that elevate your player mat so cards can fit underneath easier.

Interesting little game that looks light but takes a while to wrap your brain around.  Packaging is disappointing, in that it's unlikely to stay closed without a rubber band.  

UPDATE: I like this game quite a bit with 4 or 5, moderately with 3, and not much with 2.  Overall, it doesn't feel as balanced as Race for the Galaxy, and the runaway leader problem gets worse with fewer players.

Wow.  The power curve on this one is interesting.  Elements of Puerto Rico permeate the game.  Takes a bit to wrap one's mind about how the flow of cards works.  Definitely need a few plays.  At first glance, some of the building seem to have disproportionate cost to benefit ratios.

[b]Snowballing card engine:[/b] I feel like we've barely scratched the surface with this one, but it's a keeper. One of those games - like Parade - where you pretty quickly reach the point where someone could potentially end the game at any moment. Now that I think about it, that possibility seems like a crucial balance to Chudyk's crazy cards in that you need to be able to close when you're on the up. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This one really lives up to the hype. Fun, challenging, and surprisingly tense. The strategy element is fantastic--not only are you trying to figure out the best combos, but every action you make will create opportunities for your opponents. You have to be so careful. 

Like its sister game Innovation, there are a lot of really powerful, game-warping effects on these cards. Things can swing back and forth pretty rapidly. There are multiple buildings that can end the game the moment you construct them, for example. It definitely doesn't have quite the chaotic feel of Innovation--cards aren't flying around as much--but it's swingy, no question. I don't mind this. 

The big downside is that this game's art is cartoony and terrible. Apparently there are other editions that don't have this problem. I'm perfectly willing to overlook bad art in a great game. More significantly, there are a few balance issues. A weak opening client, which is simply a matter of luck, can make a game feel lost from the start. The Coliseum is a notably overpowered building, and definitely not in a fun way. (Both these issues are easily fixed by house rule, if you so desire.)

Two plays and I really enjoyed this game. A bit concerned the 'vault' strategy may be the best path, in which case this would drop 0.5 - 1 points, but on the other hand if I could play a few more times and be shown a definitive alternative strategy this could also go up the same amount.

The artwork of the Lookout Games version is ok.
The markers are wooden, the cards are good quality cardstock.

My only negative on the components is that the box is too small. Yes, it's true that it's just as big as necessary but if you want to sleeve the cards or fit the expansion with it...nope...not gonna happen.

Let's get to the game itself.
It has a learning curve until you know the cards and start figuring out some good combinations but until then you might be a Little overwhelmed or confused on how to get your empire running.

I really love the multi-use-cards and I've been a fan of that since I first encountered it.

Pretty cool game that has a lot to offer in just a few cards and I'm really looking forward to discovering what else I could find in there.

This game looks pretty horrible, IMO.  Looks like someone took clip art and a photoshop course and copy and pasted stuff. 

On the other hand, it is a very good game that offers lots of replayability and different paths to victory.    It is one of the few games that I have wanted to play multiple times in a short period of time, which must say something for the quality of the game itself.

I think there are too many "end game instantly" cards too.   I'd prefer fewer of them, although 1 or 2 certainly would keep people on their toes.

For years I avoided this because of the garish art -- and finally picked it up just before the Black Box was released.  Having now played both, I actually prefer the (admittedly garish and silly) early version; it does nothing to hide the marvelous strategic options or cutthroat play.

I love Race for the Galaxy and Eminent Domain, but this is so much more bloodthirsty, and because unlike those games, you use one deck for pretty much everything -- roles, materials (which kind of act as 6 mutually exclusive currencies), and buildings -- and because you have to manage your influence, buildings, clientele, stockpile, and vault, not to mention the pools, you have a dizzying array of options, all of which somehow manage to fall short of what you NEED.

And I feel like I'm just getting started seeing the possibilities.  I needed a card in the pool that wasn't there, and finally realized that I could lead a matching card to get one there.  (Two player game, so not as risky as it would be with more players.)  Of course, by the time I could fetch it back, the situation had changed, and I wound up doing something else entirely.  The endgame was awesome; my opponent stopped the game before I could finish my statue, although I had a ton of finished buildings and he had very few.  But his vault was superior enough to mine to eke out a 1-point win.

I look forward to many more plays of this one.

The sometimes chaotic but always fun role selection and resource management card game. Players use cards as either roles, buildings, building materials or clients. This leads to some intersting decisions about the best way to use a card. The IV version is sometimes unfairly maligned (IMHO) for it's cartoon style design. Personally I really like this design which is colourful a full of character. I do accept that there are some design flaws which the Black Box version will no doubt address but what flaws there are don't impact gameplay much. Players should be prepared for some card combinations which are overpowered and game-breaking but this isn't MtG and has no pretentions to trying to achieve that level of balance. A fun game which I find I want to play again win or lose.

I traded World Without End, my latest bete noir (at least for 2), for a nice copy of this.  I definitely believe the hype on this one.  We haven't played enough to understand the cards yet, but it is a whole lot more satisfying than RftG, if only because everything you do in Glory to Rome is open.  Not open info, per se, but if you discard, it will be up for grabs to others (including yourself).  The amount of variety for strategy in this one is very deep, and the mechanics, which do take a little while to get used to (although they're really quite easy once you get the hang of it), really make the game shine.  Having the cards be so multi-valent really makes you feel free as a player, with possible magic at your fingertips, while the flow of play locks you into those tough decisions.  This is my new favorite card game (well, at least it is neck and neck with Seaside) and worth paying even $40-50 for.  Great game.

RATING: 6.5
An interesting game that I owned for months before finally playing, and I still have yet to figure out the rules completely. 

I like how interdependent all of the roles seem to be. Getting out clients early is crucial, so you might get hosed if you don't happen to draw a patron on an early turn. Craftsmen are extremely important, but ultimately the merchants are what seem to generate the most points (which means laborers are also necessary early on). I feel that the benefits of many buildings are not worth the meager victory points they give you in the end, and I almost think that the deck is too large, especially with the expansions. A good, if confusing game. Terrible rule book.

Pretty impressed with my first play.  Great use of mechanics, felt like we were influencing each other's play as well.  I worry about the stagnation of the pool of cards and if the game becomes repetitive after a while (the Merchant seems really good).

Played once - see a lot of potential for my own personal enjoyment.  Barely understood what was going on, but I rarely do, so this is not a negative.  Found the number of uses for each card to be difficult to comprehend, but this added immeasurably to the game's appeal.

After 2 "learning" plays, i.e. without building effects, and now 2 full plays, it's a great game. The chaos is just right and one game, you may feel there's an overpowered strategy but the next game, you realise there's just another overpowered one that might defeat the previous one.

I still think it's good to get a "learning" play in first. at least for new players. the new player tonight had no chance in the first "full" game compared to the rest of us who had previous experience. it's about learning pool control, etc.

2p only. I really enjoy this. It's like a messier, more sprawling Race for the Galaxy, with far more interaction. It does seem pretty easy for one player to zoom ahead, but I'm pretty sure that's because we haven't yet learned all of the defensive actions you can take. And although the mechanics aren't simple, there's an elegance and intuitiveness about them that other games don't have.

There's a lot here to like - the turn structure is enviably simple and six role choices is far from complicated but the interaction of these with the card options available to you results in a satisfyingly complex game.  The card design is also very well done, with the multiple uses of each card clear and well matched well to the design.  The 'camp' card is equally well designed as a player aid - being all you really need once you've made it through the rules, other than an ocassional reference to the detailed explanation of card descriptions in the annex to the rules.  Having said that the first game went on too long, but that is pretty much inevitable with these types of games - where you need to absorb the info and options on cards etc which effectively add to the rules before you can playing efficiently - and I would expect future games to be shorter as we'll be more familiar with the rules and the cards.  That will also enable us to concentrate more on useful card combinations - those that arose in our first game were probably more accident than design - and add more tension to the finish (as well as answering the question we had as to whether drawing the Forum wins you the game).  A good game and I expect it to improve with subsequent plays.

A few further plays confirms that first impressions were fairly accurate but raises some concerns about the hidden vault scoring being such a major impact on the final score and possibly making it a bit too random (unless you enjoy a level of card counting which is much heavier than the rest of the game really justifies; in which case there's probably a queue of Freudian analysts just itching to see you). I also have a concern that being the first to pick up a Patron client can lead to a bit of a runaway leader problem.  Nevertheless, it remains an interesting design worth playing.

RATING: 7
UPDATE: Why all the hate for the art? Yes, it's cheesy. But that blends with the flavor of the game: the out-of-control building powers, the sometimes-vicious player interaction, the light-hearted take on contractor corruption. If this had serious art, you might mistake it for a serious game. I like Glory to Rome, but it just doesn't have the repeat draw of it's peers. After maybe 15 games, it just doesn't draw me anymore, and I think it's a combination of factors: games frequently effectively decided too early with a drawn-out process of one player hammering the rest, a far greater propensity for indivudal mistakes to significantly unbalance the game than even the notorious Puerto Rico, and too many knife's edge decisions where minor mistakes can lead to catastrophe, and therefore a needless sapping of the pace of the game as players diligently try to avoid these mistakes. There really is a lot of fun in the package here. But I think once you hit a certain level of mastery, for most the appeal will fall off dramatically. Still a very fun game until you get to that point though. 
---
UPDATE: After a bunch of play, I've knocked my rating down just a touch. This is still a great and fun game, but I think it can go painfully long from time to time and that the luck factor here is incredibly high. You can bring a lot of skill to bear on the game too, but sometimes you just don't get the cards, and you end up never really going anywhere and not really having fun. San Juan and Race for the Galaxy are games that are doing in the main the same thing, but in a far more polished, elegant, less punishing way. That doesn't mean GtR doesn't have a niche appeal, it clearly does; it's just up against 2 all-time classics. Most days I would easily take SJ or Race first.
---
UPDATE: Not sure my balance concerns are justified. There are a lot of powerful buildings in the deck, and while the Colosseum obviously is powerful, the threat to clients is good to have, it's expensive, and there are other combinations that are also brutal.
---
UPDATE: I do really enjoy this game, but some of the card powers are pretty wild. I'm considering just taking the Colosseum out of the game it's so nasty compared to the other cards (I suppose I should figure out a few underpowered buildings to remove from the other suits to keep the frequency of the roles and materials right). The balance of the building powers doesn't feel great, some of the buildings are killer while some aren't real winners, but it's a chaotic game, so it works out OK. I've been having quite a lot of fun with it. Playtime has definitely come down with experience, although sometime the game seems to run a little longer than it should.

The sweet spot, player-wise, seems to be 4. With 5 the pacing feels a little slow to me.
---
UPDATE: Next couple plays came down closer to 1hr, so that's good. It's fun, but it definitely feels a bit more out-of-control, with 6 different types of cards to draw from, you can feel a bit hosed from time to time as the cards you need just don't show up, which can be a bummer. But we're still enjoying it a lot.
---
So far I quite like it, but  I'm a little worried about the playing time. It says 60 minutes on the box; our last game went 90. I think at 90 minutes it's just a bit too repetitive. 60 would be perfect. Regardless, I really like the combination of stuff in the game and personally look forward to playing again. But I'm not sure that it's gone over well enough with the folks I've played it with to get traction. It's certainly pretty similar to Race for the Galaxy and San Juan, and both those games are far tighter. For me personally, it expands the genre, and I'm glad to have all three. But it may be a while before everyone else has played enough Race to get excited about this one.

Glory to Rome is sort of an expanded and more chaotic San Juan. Now instead of just being able to pick roles and take whatever roles are picked, you have to have the right card to start or get in on the action. And you can't just build buildings by spending any old cards, you have to have the right materials. And the building powers are no longer subtle, but most mid-level buildings tend to be pretty powerful and high-level buildings are game-altering. It's a nice mix, but I think it might  be a little too much, and as a result the learning curve on this one is pretty high. OK, but with a longer playing time and with a greater potential for analysis paralysis, it's harder to get multiple games in a short time, the way it's easy to come up to speed quickly with Race.

Anyway, I quite like the game, but I'm still waiting to see if it's going to fly of if it's going to be another of those games that I like a lot but never get to play.

Horrible components. Card art is fine, but the cards themselves are unpleasant to handle. I've played over 100 games of Race for the Galaxy, but after 10 games couldn't face this again.

RATING: 6
I really like the way the game works, in that every card has multiple uses, and you must decide how to use each card.  There also seem to be multiple strategies one could pursue, as there are several card combos that work well together.

My only concern is that it seems very tough for the game to go the whole distance, with someone winning due to end-of-game scoring.  It seems like various cards that grant an insta-win are fairly easy to execute for those that draw them, which was my main beef with the game after the first couple plays.  It might have just been an anomaly, but it was still rather off-putting how easy they seemed to fulfill.

Overall, I love the system, but am still unsure about game balance and the validity of shooting for end-game scoring.

Very deep game that packs a great deal of enjoyment.  It reminds me a bit of Race for the Galaxy and I imagine it will stand up to equally high level play.

Despite its awesomeness, it is a bit fiddly placing cards underneath your player Camps and this can slow the fast pace down a bit.

The Black Box also has some minor defects (Jacks have black that is wearing off) but nothing too aggravating.

I could write about this game again and again. My love since the first time and best card game of all time, for me it even beats Race for the Galaxy. Lots of cards, lots of strategies. Easier and more intuitive than RftG, but still you have to play several times before you will get along with the game. I've played so many times and it still surprizes me. Played well with all range (2-5). Polish edition rulez!

If there was ever a game that let the players dictate the terms of what was important in each game, it would be Glory to Rome. You can set your own victory conditions, point scoring conditions, and play style. Each game varies in what is important, and that creates a ton of variability in a very small package. 

Art and card quality are awful. But a strongly recommended game nonetheless.

Brilliant game of card combos, leeching, and timing. One of my greatest joys is looking at my opening hand and trying to figure out how to break the game with it.

VERY tentative rating - I've only played this like twice in one sitting.

There's some fun combo building going on here, and it seems like it would take more plays than most similar games before it starts to feel too scripted, but I could just be saying that because I spent the majority of my time playing it confused by the rules. Expect to require lots of rules referencing/clarifications your first few games.

And ye gods is it ugly! I would literally re-buy this for better art. Seriously.

[u]April 2014:[/u] 30 plays, a game that me and my wife have played repeatedly, it was supposed to replace RFTG for us and did not quite achieve it but it is the closest we've got. The gameplay is solid and I love the multiple uses cards. If I had to make one criticism it would be that the game does not promote long term planning enough as your hand of cards is cycled so very fast. Only the patron action promotes some long term strategy but one can never really anticipate which buildings one will be able to get so that it is hard to build a long-term strategy based on buildings. This is too bad as I would have liked a bit more control over these. Either way, the game is still one that we like a lot.

I didn’t like Innovation and didn’t care much for RftG (though I need to play the latter more to be able to make a final judgment). Therefore, I didn’t think I would like this game, but it turns out that I do! I have only played it a couple of times with my wife, but it was very interesting. 

There are so many strategies to follow with each of the cards and the 6 different actions. I don’t feel I have scratched the surface of this game and I look forward to play it again with more players to see how the game works with additional interaction (primarily because of the Legionary action).

[b]Includes The Republic expansion.[/b]
If there's a contest between San Juan, Race for the Galaxy, and Glory to Rome for "best card tableau game," then my vote would be GtR. Glory to Rome is one of the meatier card games that I like to play, and I hope to get yet more plays in to explore even further the card combinations. 

Like Puerto Rico, in Glory to Rome, a player chooses a role, and then everyone follows that role. I find this "follow the leader" mechanic creates a great rhythm to the game, where everyone is constantly involved. What also makes GtR a bit unusual is that many of the cards are wildly powerful, creating combinations that can have dramatic effect on player tableaus. And this is where I suspect increased familiarity will add even more enjoyment as players explore those possibilities.

Regarding the glorified "clip art" appearance of the game, I don't mind. I find it kind of charming and endearing, though I did sleeve my cards for durability. If I stumbled across a black box edition, I might be tempted, but my concern would be that the garish colors of the original are immediately identified in that muck of cards in the middle when it comes to choosing building materials. A more discrete artwork might actually hinder that a bit.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Finally got a chance to play Chudyk's classic and it met my expectations. Every card does different things and the building powers are definitely as crazy as advertised. We played with 5 and I fear that's not the best number since there is a lot of going around the table twice each turn and made the game almost 2 hours. While the game is very thinky it is fun to play and I definitely think the game is worth the effort to learn. The game took up a lot of table space and we had cards everywhere so it felt like a lot to take in, but it's a game I can definitely see myself thinking about over the next few weeks which is always a good sign.

An intelligent game, to be sure, and a complex one, but one whose complexity is of a sort that is orthogonal to the sort I frequently like: games whose playing experience involves keeping straight a great many details with no thematic structure in which to organize those thoughts.

A, for me, grail game that I finally finally got to the table. Glorious chaos ensued. I got the impression my friends didn't know what to think. It felt like Buster Keaton falling-down-the-stairs as a boardgame. Perhaps, thematically, that is the point, to convey and play with the excesses and insanity that was Rome. I'll see if the group will let me bring it out again ha ha.

update: 2nd play, a friend finds an crazy broken combo halfway through the game and runs away with it. Laughter and perplexed looks follow. Seriously, what a wacky game, damn I can't wait to play it again.

update: 3rd play, play with a friend from work and he seemed confused by it the entire time. Not by the mechanisms necessarily, my friend is pretty game savy, more just a general what the hell. He laughed a lot when we played. People seem to laugh a lot when they play GtR.

I've finally played the newer version (we have the 2nd printing) and I do not like it as much.  The toned down cards flatten the play too much; the over-abundance of Jacks makes them worth less.  However, the out of town sites are very cool.  I would consider adding those to our game.

This one has had more staying power than Race for the Galaxy, but mostly because my wife likes it.  The card combos are crazy, and you really build some strong engines, but it is like its cousin Innovation in that the game will have swings between the favor of the players.  Combos that are really humming early on may eventually be countered or contained by later combos from opponents.  To my way of thinking, this is a great way to implement a civ-builder.

In the end, both my wife and I just gravitated towards the play that was offered by innovation.  This was gathering dust, seemed redundant in the collection, and was worth some money, so it has been sold off.

This has been very well received. I couldn't get past the horrid art in the original, but was happy to obtain a Black Box copy. The cards are deteriorating faster than I think they should, but the game itself has been a delightful surprise.

After one play I see a TON of potential here. I love the multi-use cards, they create lots of good choices and consequences for actions. The buildings may have some serious imbalances, but I think that is by design. Definitely want to get more plays of this one to investigate further.

This card game is not as difficult as its reputation suggests. It is accessible though challenging. Each card may be played in one of several different possible ways. Balancing whether a card should be played for its role, its material, its building, or person, makes for some exciting decisions. Yes, there is some luck involved, in that you can only build the building which you are lucky enough to draw which may leave you at a disadvantage to your opponent's draw. Nevertheless, with multiple ways to get on the victory path, the luck is mitigated. I hesitate to suggest that there are multiple paths to victory, because in my experience, there appear to be about two main paths, with one being stronger than the other. But there are many ways of moving yourself down that path. Great game. Very enjoyable.

Well it finally arrived and it was worth the wait. Glory to Rome uses a lot of elements that I love in other games (Race for the Galaxy, San Juan, Eminent Domain, Puerto Rico). It's one of those games which I can see feeling really random and uncontrollable for the first few games but then rewarding continued play with an improved ability to control your game. I can see this hitting the table quite a bit in the near future.

RATING: 7
While not as enjoyable as Carl Chudyk's Innovation, I still usually enjoy this game.  I think that fans generally agree that the main goal in this game is to find some "broken" combination of cards and exploit that as much as possible.  (What that combination can be very much depends upon the cards you receive during the early course of the game).  

One minor drawback is that the 'craftsman' action very much seems to be better than getting buildings into play via the 'architect' action (involving the extra step of getting cards into your stockpile, although a card like "Sewers" helps you out in this respect).  

So don't take this game too seriously, and enjoy the ride you, or someone else, find(s) to win.

I have the version with the cartoon art, which I liked. I enjoyed the little quotes on the cards. The problem is that this game gives me a headache to play. There is too much negative interaction between players. You spend all this time building a card engine just to see it blown apart and your entire strategy gone. It is frustrating and just not something that I enjoy.

GtR may be a little bit difficult to get into due to its somewhat cyclical structure but the strategic and tactical possibilities are amazing. Definitely not a beginner's game but one incredibly rich in combos, tactical quick-thinking and some fierce interaction. Cool cartoony art (at least in the European version). Prepare for some immediate rematches.

This game really rocks. 
Most of the buildings are apparently unbalanced, but the game always unbalances in different directions, so it is very replayable, every game is different and multiple strategies can be used. GtR is lightyears away from other role-selection games like San Juan.

Additionally, having more than one hundred cards on the table at the same time is really cool :-)

Great, great game.  I like it much better than both Race for the Galaxy and San Juan.  However, the art in this game is just atrocious (and so is some of the color scheme).

Kickstarted (2011).

Still not a fan of the art, but this is a bit better.  Although the previous one is gaudy and silly, the gaudy (loud) art made quick glances for materials easy.

Still, the game survives whatever art it has.  I still prefer some of the foreign editions out there.

I'm sorry but this game is borderline broken.  It's way too dependent on lucky card draws and if you don't get good/lucky cards out early there are too many broken building combinations that mean you're going to be spending a very boring hour to an hour and a half just getting slapped around by the table.  Not fun.

There is a lot here that is compelling and I really wanted to like the game ... but it's a long way off before I'd be willing to give it another go.  Right now this is a "I'm picking up my stuff and going home" game.

My first play of this I was immediately struck by its similarity to Race for the Galaxy.  Several plays later, I continue to think it is similar but I see a lot of differences.

Some similarities are that it involves role selection and cards serve multiple purposes.  If possible, the cards serve even more purposes than they do in RftG.  The differences include more ways of reaching end game conditions, hidden veeps in the form of material in one's vault, and more player interaction.  I think GtR is easier to learn and teach than RftG.  The player mats are very helpful.  

I think RtfG is a tiny bit better for two players.  The Legionary role of GtR suffers with only two.  Even so, more often that not I've played and enjoyed GtR with only 2.

I enjoy both games a great deal.  They're different enough that it's worth owning both.

A wonderful resource management, city-building card game that is remarkably deep and offers numerous paths to success. The ability to take on certain roles, stash gold, materials, and build different kinds of buildings, all for influence that has an impact on other abilities makes this game deceptively deep. We prefer it easily over San Juan. See our review.

Strategic depth in a small package and short playing time.  Every game plays different.  End of the day it's not a hard game to teach.

I also love the simplicity and elegance of the Black Box design.

Trashy filler game (filler statuslarge player number, can actually be a full fledged game with say 3 players) where the winner is the player that abuses the system the most.

Fun though. The place where this game really shines is the end game. Can a player slip an unbeatable combination past his opponents? Or will the other players form a temporary blockade until someone else is in danger of winning? There's only one way to find out!

Black Box Edition from KS.  Probably my favorite game.  Beautiful look on the table and elegant pacing and gameplay.  It has a lot of my favorite game elements, particularly the sense that even if you're not winning you're doing something fun.  Great role-selection mechanic and a lot of depth to learn.  Downside seems to be that it can be really unbalanced with players with differing levels of experience with the game.

Played at BGG.Con.  Now, to be fair to this game, I was REALLY, REALLY drunk when I played it.  

Basically, its like San Juan, bulked up on total Steroids. I HATE San Juan, but I liked Glory to Rome.  Lots of little buildings your putting up, lots actions to set up the process of building stuff. I wasn't going to win in the game I played, but I built a fort early (making me immune to the other people stealing my stuff), and focused on just trying to figure out how stuff got done, and managed to get in a position of kingmaker.  Not bad for being really, really drunk.

However, if you're looking for a game ABOUT Rome, and Roman politics, pass this by. This has NOTHING to do about Rome.  Its a good little building game, and is definitely interesting in its own right, but any semblance of a resemblance to political culture of Roman Patricians backing public works in order to gain favor in the political intrigue of the Senate is purely accidental.  This game demonstrates my pet peeve about 'Victory Points'- without some context of what they mean, the game itself is just sort of...pointless. The Patrician class saw these buildings as an ESSENTIAL tool in the competition for prestige and political power in the Senate- but they were still a means to an end. In Glory to Rome, the buildings and the points they give you are the end in themselves- putting the cart before the horse.

But still, a good game, and I'd like to try it again while not so drunk.

Components: Sub-par production quality. Feels very much like a home-made deck (mostly because of the graphics). This game is not aesthetically pleasing. I've seen the newer edition, and find it less garish, but also to have poor graphic design.

Experience: Very interesting. The leading/following and clientele mechanisms feel very new to me. In my one playing there was almost always something to do. There is an interesting (and thematically appropriate) shift from the importance of architects in the early game, when cards in the pool are plentiful, to craftsmen, when cards in the pool are scarce. The game was immediately interesting.

Black Box version:  art is cool but I find the cards harder to read so actually might prefer the original art version.

Because the cards are used in multiple ways, this is one of the hardest games I've had to explain to new players.  But after 1 or two plays everybody gets it, and always say they enjoy it.  I like the fact you can play on other players turns, and the sudden death victory cards that need to be watched out for.  The art is called "cheesy" or "childish" by some, but I find the cards easy to read and fun to play.

Very clever cardgame. The trick is to understand the various paths of the cards: how to get cards from you hand into the vault, from your stockpile into a buildings, etc. Certain buildings provide short-cuts and bonuses that can be very helpful - even game-winning.

Besides all the cleverness, the level of interaction is similar to games like Puerto Rico and Agricola. For me, that's too little. Hence the "6".

I love this game. It is excellent, but probably not worth what it currently commands in the secondary market. I am hoping that somehow Cambridge Games will eventually sell the rights of the game to another company that can actually make a great version of the game. Oh, and don't tell me that Mottainai replaces this, because Mottainai sucks.

If you can get past the cartoony artwork (I easily can), then you will be able to enjoy this wonderful game for it's mechanics.  I like how the buildings can be built or played as building materials for preexisting buildings.  I like how when the buildings are built, they increase your VPs as well as your Clientele capacity.  Definitely some unique things going on here.

Overall, a good gaming experience, but, like Race for the Galaxy, it would be too difficult to introduce to new gamers, and the rules abiguities just drive me nuts.

This is a seriously fantastic game. The interplay of the cards and their many uses makes for constantly challenging decisions and very interesting interactions. It is incredibly clever, too - a truly original game. Finally, although it is clearly designed for more than two players and has some elements that don't work quite right at that count, it is still great fun with two players. This is typically how I play it and I still love it. Plus, you can get a lot of game in very quickly, which is great for a weeknight.

Glory to Rome: Все игры, которые создаёт Chudyk, оказываются революционными, и эта не стала исключением. Правда, оказалось, что в неё сложно обучать новых игроков, поскольку многие нюансы игры оказываются совсем неочевидными. По мне, так недавняя Mottainai вполне похожа на Glory to Rome, но гораздо проще для понимания и объяснения, так что с успехом заменяет оригинал. Я уже сыграл в неё в два раза больше партий, чем в в Glory to Rome.

Really enjoy this game. Not even sure why. I like the actions you can coordinate by using what others are doing or take your own path to victory. I like the interaction you can get by the buildings and client roles you collect. Artwork is fun. Scoring is somewhat hidden so in a close game it is hard to tell who is winning but at times it can be a runaway for one player as the rest say "enough is enough". Great when you win and can even be fun when getting crushed! I love grabbing lots of client roles!

RATING: N/A
Glory to Rome is a card-based city building and resource management game with a novel mechanism. Each card may act as a building, a client, a raw material, or a valuable resource, frequently forcing players into difficult decisions regarding how each card should be used. In addition, much of the game is played from the discard pool, giving players some control over what cards are accessible to opponents. Actions are triggered by a form of card-driven role selection -- the active player leader a role, and other players may follow if they discard a matching card from hand (to the pool). Players who don't follow may 'think' to draw more cards. There are thus strong interactions between the different uses of cards. Scoring is a combination of completing buildings and storing resources, with end-of-game bonuses for storing a diverse assortment. Game length is player-controlled, and is triggered in a few different ways.

The unknown publisher and relatively mediocre components led to expectations that the game far exceeds.  It's a very worthy addition to the recently crowded Choose Roles & Build Stuff genre.  Just a little heavier and longer than Race For The Galaxy, it features somewhat more player interaction.  There are a few cards that let you actually mess with other people's stuff, and you also have some control over which cards become available to your opponents.  Fans of the genre should definitely give it a shot.  (A bigger publisher should also consider a reprint with thicker cards and perhaps fancier artwork.)

It took me a long time to come up with a rating for Glory To Rome (GtR). The first few plays, I couldn't wrap my head around the system and was playing cards almost randomly. After a few  more plays, things started to come together and I did enjoy GtR more and more. Unfortunately, most of my friends don't value GtR that high and so it's always a fight for me to get it to the table. The most heard complaint is that GtR is too fiddly and that the rules are a convoluted mess. While I think that this is true to a certain degree, there's a lot to like once you know how this machine works. 

I would love to explore GtR and it's crazy combos further in the future now that I'm not struggling with the basic mechanisms anymore. If I do get the chance to do so, I will also update my rating accordingly. Until then, this is a solid 7.

This is a pretty neat game, and I wanted to like it more than I did.  Why didn't I?  Partly because none of the others of my game group enjoyed it, partly because I had a hard time figuring out how to make the cards work with each other, but I think that it mostly had to do with the fact that my favorite game of all time is Magic:The Gathering, and pretty much every other card game pales in comparison.

RATING: 9
Really good game - quick(ish) strategic and fun and it also plays well with 2 through 5 players. One of the best 'build an engine' games around, with a huge variety to experiment with due to the wide variety of buildings available and the multiple end conditions.

When playing with only 2, some of the buildings which grant 1 think/action per influence upon completion, perhaps should have some 'cap' put on them as this can get a little silly given how much influence you can get in a 2-player game.

Very slightly let down by the production quality - the style of artwork grew on me (I was very negative about it originally - but it sort of fits with a game which has some 'take that' moments) but it would probably still benefit from a less cartoony feel - and linen finish cards always, always benefits a card game.

It's still worth killing your granny to get a copy of one of the existing editions but hopefully it will be reprinted (with some improvements) to avoid such a drastic price.

Because this (incredible) game is out of print, I created and had professionally printed a custom version for myself.  

I then had a few more copies printed to give to my friends, too (I guessed they'd be happy to have it--rather than buying one for $98-178 online.) 


Here is the BGG thread where it is described and pictured. http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1545185/my-gtr-face-lift  It's nice it gets a few thumbs and won the BGG "pimp my boardgame" contest.  

Turns out I have one last, extra copy, which I'm willing to trade.  The cards are brand new.  It includes the base game, plus the Imperium and BGG expansions, rule book, player camps (ie, mats), but no box (but I can send you artwork so you can easily make your own--or, I guess if we make a really good trade I could do it for you.)

Like others have said, this is a lot like San Juan, but with more strategy.  Like any card game, sometimes you don't draw the cards you need.  But its easy enough to switch gears and go in a different direction most of the time.  I can see this getting a lot of play.

The game is good enough that it should really come in a larger box.  The negatives have to do with production/development.  The plastic container it comes in is too small and seems cheap.  The cards are also tightly boxed into 3 card-boxes.  I like the card boxes but they are too small.  It's a pain to put the cards back in there...which as someone noted, is only going to be tougher as the cards get used more.  Oh yeah, and the site cards don't have a box....just an open ended flimsy cellophane "container".  I would have prefer they upgrade the components and charge a little more for the game.  They could even leave out the merchant bonus chips.  They don't seem necessary.

Also, you need a lot of room to play this game.  There are lots are cards scattered about in the play area: All around your playmat, buildings (to the side), and card pool (in the middle)...not to mention space for the drawdeck and jacks.

Now that I have played it some more, my opinion of this game has increased. I don't think I will ever like quite as much as Race For the Galaxy, but it is still fun to explore the design space that this game offers. 

The graphics (and box!) are awful though, and I ultimately got rid of it due to the annoyance involved in transporting it. I signed up for the new and improved kickstarter version though.

Players are rebuilding bits of Rome after the fires of 64AD.  Meaty card game, very much in the vein of San Juan, where players are managing cards through various states (around 5, I think) via the now ubiquitous role selection mechanic.  The initial 15 minutes are a big "huh?", but then it clicks and literally flies along.  The rules sensibly recommend ignoring the building powers for the first game - great move, as the buildings add several layers of depth to the game play.  Good rules, nice if rather colourful presentation.  Several game end triggers to watch out for.  I'm enjoying this one, and it's getting better.

RATING: 9
Idea:
Play cards from hand to activate actions.

Mechanism:
Each card has 3 different "values" a) its color which it activates b) material that is used on building = same as color though c) building effect-

First player plays a card to activate action: a) patron to put card from table aside to activate actions free b) Build from hand or storage c) collect card from table to storage d) fight - reveal card to steal one of that color from neighbors hands e) store card from storage to vault as VPs

Other either join the action by playing identical card (or getting it free if you have color as patron) or draw cards.

Idea is to build buildings and store cards to vault for VPs. Finished buildings also give effects like increase hand size.

to who:
Those who quick strategy card games that still have enough to wash out luck element.

Note: original copy looks neat but I didnt like the new copy's graphics

Part of the San Juan style of games.  I like this the most.  It's definitely it's own game and has some interesting stuff through out.

The concepts and mechanisms of this game might be a little difficult to grasp at first, but once you get it, it plays quite smooth. Calling a role is really cool, because it demands you to think about what your opponents might plan. The multifunctional card and calling an action, that all players can follow reminds of Race for the Galaxy, but I like the theme of this much better. The cartoony artwork is also very good.

Pretty good game that has some similarities to Race For The Galaxy, but pre-dates it.  Cards serve four purposes - coins, people (roles), building, and resources.  This makes it a bit cluttered and confusing at first.  There is a lot to think about and a few different paths to victory.  I like the way the card pool and Clients function.  Heavier than it looks with the glossy cards and cartoonish art.  But, if I'm going to play a game in this style, I'd prefer RFTG.

Az egyik kedvenc játékom. Ha sikerül felfogni minden szabályt elsőre, akkor egyből egy nagyszerű játékélményt nyújt. Rengeteg olyan mechanizmus van a játékban, ami tetszik, kezdve a kártyalapok többféle felhasználási módjától, a kézlimit átlépésén át, a két ugyanolyan színű lap szenátorként való felhasználásán keresztül, egészen a meditálás utáni ügyfél általi cselekvési lehetőségig (követőként) és még sorolhatnám. A szerencse szerepe végig jelen van (kártyajáték lévén), tehát abból kell gazdálkodni, ami jön. Egy példa a szerencsére. A tegnapi játéknapon a sógorom felépítette a kolosszeumot, ami által légiós szerep választásakor képes volt a szomszédaitól a nyersanyagon kívül ügyfeleket is elszipkázni, ezzel a többszörös akció lehetőséget csökkenteni (nagyon fájdalmas tud lenni :)) és ezzel egyidőben azokat a kincstárába helyezni (természetesen a befolyás korlát figyelembevételével), amik a végén győzelmi pontokat jelentenek. Nagyon erős épület, ami ellen szerencsére lehet védekezni a Fal vagy Palánk megépítésével (az más kérdés, hogy azok meg áthidalhatók egy Híd megépítésével). Hogy jön ide a szerencse szerepe? Hát úgy, hogyha nem sikerül egyáltalán Fal vagy Palánk lapot húzni, akkor teljesen kiszolgáltatott maradsz a Kolosszeummal szemben. Tegnap nekünk szerencsénk volt, mert sikerült elég hamar egy-egy Falat felhúzni (ami a végén más előnyt is biztosított), mialatt a sógoromnak nem sikerült Híd kártyát felhúznia. A játék egy kicsit komplex, de 1 játék után szerintem minden a helyére kerül és utána további játékalkalmak adnak lehetőséget a különböző izgalmas kombinációk (értsd, sok győzelmi pontot hozó) felkutatására, de bőven megéri a ráfordított időt. Dicsőség Rómának! (2015.08.17.)

Like many detractors of this game, I hated the cartoonish artwork.  However, I certainly wouldn't let it discourage me from playing the game.

The gameplay itself did that.  The first thing that pissed my group off was discovering all the rules hidden in the rulebook that should have been printed right on the cards.  We were constantly looking up the various powers of various cards, every one of which would have fit right on the cards, but wasn't put there so that they could cram in more lousy artwork.

Some neat mechanisms in there, but the game was poorly produced and the rules poorly organized.  Those are game-killers every time.

PERSONAL COPY. Absolutely amazing game (bear with the steep learning curve)! My number 1 game! I own the Black Box edition and it looks better than the original clipart version (though still uglier than the German version) but at least the icon work well, excellent card stock! Little-to-none AP, insane powers and combinations to play with. Even if you don't win, you still feel proud of what you built. I've never played a game I didn't enjoy. Scales well though 5 players can bog the game down just a little bit. 3-4 seems like a sweet spot. It's almost physically exhausting to teach.

What I enjoy most about the game is finding out interesting card interactions. Just when you think you know everything about a game, someone stops your Colosseum with their Triclinium and you're like "WHAT!?"

RATING: 5
I've tried this one multiple times, but it has yet to click with me.  It was sold to me as a building game like RftG, but I don't think it has too many similarities to other such titles.  The silly amount of unintuitive complexity in the card flow rules (where stuff goes if you discard it, or play it, or use it to do an action), plus the oddity of the endgame goals (you're trying to get points, but most of your points come from hoarding resources, not building with them) always frustrates me.  It really feels like 5 functions for each card and a half-dozen different pools that they can shuffle between is just too much fiddliness, and for far too little payoff.
Oh, and the artwork..  The amount of ridiculous snobbery surrounding merely the printing of this game makes me laugh.  The old cartoony art wasn't great, but it was serviceable and I didn't hate it.  The international edition looks generally better, if less quirky.  And the deluxe edition looks like a bad throwback to the 70s.  This minimal style does nothing for me, and I find it baffling that so many people prefer it.  It doesn't hurt my desire to play the game (I'll let the gameplay do that), but still..

There's urgency each turn to maintain your position in the race. There's tension created by the multiple stages required to make publicly-visible progress when building a building, moving materials to a vault, or using something from the pool. There are several ways to interact, and slow down leaders, which is a very welcome thing in an engine-building race game.

The length is great. The powerful combos are entertaining.

But sometimes you won't draw good cards, and the pool will be empty, and it'll be difficult for you to affect the game. If you find yourself in this situation after someone has built a powerful combo, you've probably already lost. In a 2-player game you can resign. But in a 3-player game, what do you do?

RATING: N/A
Own the black box edition.

when I first played the game (it was the original edition), it left me confused and I just can't wait for the game to be over. I just wasn't blown away with the game.

Then I tried a friend's copy of the black box edition recently, and it turned out very well. I like it a lot and admires how much strategy it offers. It's probably because I was still new in the hobby when I first tried the game (it was 1-1.5 years ago). Still, it was still confusing to wrap around on how the game works, but after a few rounds, I managed to overcome that.

I'm currently on the lookout for card games that is portable, highly strategic, and offers some unique and cool elements/gameplay (like card drafting, sliding or slipping cards, etc), and GtR simply hits all the spot (maybe I can make some portable camp board to replace the one from the game). 

However, I don't think I will ever teach this game to a complete non-gamers, but still I'm willing to give it a try if there's a chance. Enough examples, rundowns and clear concept of the game should be part of explanation.

My kind of euro though. It has engine building, but adds lots of overblown powers into the mix and some player interaction. My only critisim is that you can end up with cards everywhere on the table. It can become abit of a mess.

gave away to some friends that liked it

Kártyajáték, de nagyon okos, jól tervezhető, izgalmas. Szinte táblásjáték. :-). Szép kártyák, mivel magyarul is, így meg aztán tényleg jól használható. Nem túl rövid: pont azért mert nem a könnyed kártyajáték kategória, hanem annál mélyebb. Persze mint a kártyajátékokban, ott a szerencse is, de mindez nem zavarja a játékot, érdekes, izgalmas marad.

A little bit busy with all the cards, and the artwork chosen. I think the randomness from the cards hurts the heavy game it seems to want to be, especially considering the length. I'd play it again, though I think that usually, when I think about playing this, I'd rather play something else.

Might just be the newness, but a very nice game...

rating on limited plays so far has room to go up or down.

high amount of variety in the play so far (~10 plays). play changes from game to game and with the number of players.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Im sure this game will go up in rating once I've played it more than twice.  So far, I've discovered that if you stuff your clientale with Laborers and Merchants, you quickly have a broken combo to stuff cards into your vault and win.  It works beautifully because you keep your opponent from building any of the 'better' vp buildings by constantly scooping the resources they need out of the pool.  I must find a combo breaker!  

Edit:  After 10+ plays, I have to say, this game is excellent.  Lately, I'm trying to find a way to make an architect/patron combo work to my advantage.

GTR is a really fun game to play. Unfortunately the dated look on the artwork really hurt the game for us and made it a tad difficult to get to the table. We also don't generally play very many card games as it is, so that also made it hard for us to get it to the table. I'll still happily play it if people want to, but I typically won't suggest it.

There's a learning curve: more than San Juan but not as bad as Race for the Galaxy.  If you like San Juan or Race, you should definitely give this a try.  Hate to say it but graphics really are a deterrent to wanting to play this more often. 1-1

2018-02-13 : Hadn't played it in years, so I made all the rooky mistakes all over again. As it's an unforgiving game I was again reminded how much I like it : despite what some may think, this is not a game of luck : if you play badly, you will lose, badly and love it

Bumped my rating from 7.5 (original Glory to Rome) to 9 for the Black Box Edition. The higher rating is also due to more Glory to Rome games under my belt. You have to play a few games to realy understand the mechanics of this truly amazing game. More I play it more I fall in love with the game, every new game is diffrent and brings new and intresting card combination powers. I highly recommended Glory to Rome Black Box Edition.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Glory to Rome is another card game where cards serve multiple functions (ala San Juan and Race for the Galaxy).  The cards convey 4 important pieces of information: (1) resource type, (2) VP value, (3) Associated role action, and (4) Special ability when the card is 'built'.

On your turn you can simply draw card(s) or play an role card to perform it's associated action.  If you play an action other people can likely take part in the initiated action and/or draw card(s).  The game comes with player board to track your influence (dictates number of clientel/vault cards), vault (cards you have played face down for their VP value only), clientel (cards which allow you to take role associated actions even if you don't have the specific role card in your hand) and stockpile (cards for the six type of resources.  The game can end in multiple ways, which are in control of the players.  One of which causes one person to instantly win regardless of individuals VP, so be careful.

Overall, there are a neat combos that are available and the interaction between players is much higher than in San Juan and RftG.  I can see what people meant when they said that the likely winner will be the one that can create the most 'broken' combo first.  Glory to Rome is still definitely worth checking and I'm sure some will even prefer this one, to the more multiplayer solitaire tablue-based card games.

Since "on steroids" is such a cliche, let's just call this "San Juan Gone Wild!" If you like San Juan for its elegance, Glory to Rome may not be the game for you. But if you've ever thought that San Juan needed more buildings, roles, mechanisms, paths to victory, and a hidden VP "stash," this game will probably hit a sweet spot for you.   It's been a long time since I've found a game that I want to replay immediately after finishing as much as this one.

Edit after playing Version I.V - The out-of-town sites and tweaked buildings worked just fine. The game's even better now.

Better than Race for the Galaxy. There, I said it. 

Another rock solid multifuntion card game. The graphics are fine, cartoonish but completely acceptable. This game is not as complicated as you think. If you've played RftG or San Juan, you are well on the way to understanding this one. 

I guess I also have to throw in the fact that 25 bucks is a solid price point for this title. 

Another thing that has thrown me on the GtR train is the fact that I'm pretty sure this game isn't going to come out with some BS 17 card expansion for 2/3 the cost of the base game. (please don't prove me wrong on that one)

[b][thread=815795]The PLAYMOBIL® Legion reviews "Glory to Rome: Black Box"[/thread][/b]

(As of [b]10[/b] plays) An innovative hand management card game with many different, shifting strategies involved. Quite tricky to get your head around the gameplay at first, and there are almost too many moving parts, but once you're familiar with how everything works it gets less intimidating and presents you with very challenging and fun decisions every turn. Has gradually climbed in my ratings from a 7 to a 9.

The Black Box edition is very elegant and makes it easier to introduce this excellent game to gamers who might otherwise be put off by the cartoonish graphics and gradients of the original. While I am happy to play with the original, I'm much more comfortable pulling this version out.

[b]2 year verdict:[/b] 10 plays in and I'm pretty much hooked. While I was supremely unsure of its merits the first time I played it, it has gradually become my favorite hand management game. It feels like there's still a lot more fun stuff to explore here.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Grudging respect which has grown over more plays.  This is a clever system, but just not my kind of game.  I like hurting other players, and this forces you to decide how much you are willing to help others every time you play a card.  Also, not generally a fan of special powers and combinations, but I'm getting the hang of what's possible.

RATING: 9.5
Card-based city building and resource management game with cartoon artwork set in ancient Rome, but with strong strategic/tactical elements.  The cheap packaging and artwork and little known publisher probably keep it from being the big success that it deserves to be.  Comparable to San Juan and Puerto Rico, along with some MtG elements.  I'm very impressed after about a dozen or more plays - takes a bit to get your head around gameplay if you're figuring out from the rules, but much easier to learn if explained firsthand.  Some mechanics and ideas are somewhat reminiscent of Puerto Rico, but this has additional aspects that I found more appealing on first play.  Play time is about 30 minutes or less a player.  Really, really enjoy this!

[b]Imperial rules[/b] (original) vs [b]Republic[/b] (revised):
[q]The Republic rules derived from the MIT House Rules, but have some further card revisions to make it more balanced. The Imperial rules are functionally identical to the I.V edition.[/q]
Cards changed in Republic: Circus (Crane), Senate (Tribunal), Colosseum (Domus Aurea), Forum (Forum Romanum)

Republic  is available as an expansion: [gameid=121766]
The revised Republic rules/cards (e.g. only need two matching cards instead of three for a petition) are recommended for an easier experience and new players, they have less take-that but also remove most of the pool control part of the game by flooding it.
What people prefer: [thread=1409120][/thread] and [thread=943474][/thread] and [thread=681491][/thread]

Love it.  Perhaps my favourite card game.

I prefer it to RftG as the game lasts a little bit longer and the functions of the built structures can be enjoyed a little before the game ends. Those are very different games, anyway.

Works well 2 player and 4 player (haven't tried 3 player).

Some lucky card combos are ridiculously powerful. Don't come here looking for fairness. Great fun!

(While it's contentious, I prefer the much more engaging, colourful, and god-awful-ugly artwork/clip-art on the earlier edition.)

One of my all-time favorite games even though I'm not particularly good at it, and the best strategic card game out there (OK, along with Race). It's always engaging, compelling, and different. It's a real work of genius the way the cards are used in so many different ways, and the buildings are truly inspired not just staid +1 this or -1 that. 

I absolutely love the crazy building combos available and the different ways to get the VP engine going that this game offers while at the same time offering you the "long bomb" of going for the Forum (which wins the game outright regardless of VPs). One could say that all the buildings in G2R are broken and therein lies the balance. The challenge is to build some kind of engine and get it on the track ASAP.

Oh, and for the record, the original artwork never bothered me, and I look down my nose at the people who looked down their noses and wouldn't touch this game until the new version came out. I absolutely loathe the new art as I find its constrained style dull and antithetical to the spirit of the game. But nerd prejudices aside, it's a great game, and everybody should rate it a 10.

Seriously ugly game.  You'll probably want to replace these cards with Star Wars themed cards from the internet once you've played once.

The common pool of cards dried up early on after both players received powers to put their played card into storage, rendering half the possible actions useless.  Vault contents became critical at the end of the game, and should have won the game for the player with the most vaulted goods.  But stacking powers allowed one player to complete ten or so buildings all at once and end the game.  Game strategy ended up a little haphazard because of that lucky draw at the last minute.

It reminded me of the next level (or 3) from San Juan, where you have to choose how to use the card, half of the decision is what you won't be doing with that card.

GtR is a great game with lots going on and multiple paths to victory.  It is in the same genre as Race for the Galaxy and less so San Juan in that there is a long and slow, but fortunately not too steep, learning curve, although the gameplay is not the same as these others.  The first hurdle, like RfG, is understanding the game mechanics, which are not terribly intuitive at the start.  As one starts to understand the card powers and combos, and begins to see how to use the mechanics to play off of your opponent(s) leads, things start clicking.  There is lots of stuff going on here, and GtR seems therefore deeper than San Juan and on par with Race.

I really enjoy this game so far, and my wife seems to love it, so I look forward to many more plays.

Addendum: I just uppped my rating from 7.5 to 9 after 38 plays, mostly two player with my wife.  This game has so much to offer.  Every game plays out differently, and I am still finding new interactions and nuances.  Great stuff here!

The use of role selection keeps the game moving at a good pace, since all the players are involved one way or another each turn. The buildings offer a powerful variety of potentially abusive card comboes that I'm sure to enjoy manipulating over multiple plays.

Rating is for the Republic rules. Haven't played with Imperial rules to rate it.

Glory to Rome is a difficult game, not only to play well (something which I'm still working on), but also to explain what makes it so fun. The mechanics feel unlike anything else I've played. There is a great deal of player interaction and very little downtime. Then there are the card abilities, which easily give rise to many powerful combos. It sometimes feels as if the game is a race to assemble the most powerful combo available, and while things can get chaotic, there's always fun and excitement in the ensuing chaos.

2011 TH

Goofball illustrations lead me to believe this card game was going to be a very light party game. What a shock when I discovered this is a strategic game, and one I like, a lot!

The thrust of the game is to rebuild Rome from lowly latrines to exalted temples, and everything in between. When buildings are completed, special abilities are bestowed that combine in surprising and delightful ways with other buildings you have completed, and combinations are endless. (However, the instant win conditions seem too strong--all games won so far have been with the Forum.) 

The cards are of great variety and well designed, and I enjoy the numerous ways each card can be used--very efficient. Lots of decisions. The game plays in 30-45 mins., but can occasionally slow up. Rules are easy. Play is interactive. Replay-ability is high. 

This card game is on the light side of a genre I enjoy (it is often compared to San Juan and the elegant Race for the Galaxy--one of my top 10), but easier to learn and just fun to play. The rating will go up if the Forum ability is not as overpowering as it first appears. This game will get more plays--it is already headed for the next game night.

RATING: 8
Takes a play or two to get used to the cards and their powers.  The theme of rebuilding Rome fits in well with the rest of the game.

In my opinion, this is much more fun than "Race for the Galaxy" (but to be fair, I haven't played "Race for the Galaxy" that much).

Has everything to become a regular classic.  Many cool elements and with skill you achieve a greater control over your game than what may seem too chaotic at first glance.  Excellent game.

I think the most damning thing I can say about the game is that I'm a three-time former owner.  Though it is an interesting game I'd much rather play Race for the Galaxy, Innovation or Dominion.  For a game of it's length there isn't enough variance in the gameplay and the cards are just plain ugly.

An excellent game with many things going on.  A fair amount more [i]direct[/i] interaction to be found than RftG.  Many cards are extremely strong and the game length is never certain.  It's a wild ride from start to finish.  I enjoy the thought process in RftG better, but I think this provides a little more tension.  I wouldn't put too much stock in comparisons made about this game.  It's very much its own beast.  The role selection is only superficially similar.

Ganar con las catacumbas es una cochinada, esa carta no deberia existir ya que joroba la estrategia del juego. 

Por lo demás, es un gran juego. Tienes que planificar tu estrategia al comienzo aunque siempre debes estar preparado para cambiarla si es necesario. Tras un par de partidas, después de la partida de iniciación, se convierte en un juego no muy difícil, pero con mucha complejidad estratégica.

My favorite card game so far, above [thing=28143][/thing] and [thing=63888][/thing].

I like this thematic blend of mechanics and buildings. A lot of decisions and choices to make according not only your strategy but also according to your fellow opponents's tableau :

(1) - what role to lead or not given other players's clients ?
(2) - what other players's buildings will impact your game or the end game conditions ?

The heart of the game is the pool management. How to recycle the cards in your hand into the pool in order to :
(1) - recruit the clients you want
(2) - take the raw materials for your buildings or your vault

The Black Box edition bring a higher level of gaming experience because of the way the cards convey information with clarity and the use of appropriate colours.

Best with 3 players.

Great strategic-depth to price ratio!  I love Race for the Galaxy, and heard that this game is quite similar.  Glory can easily take twice as long, feels slightly more fiddly, and can seem a little more chaotic than Race.  However, there is a little more player interaction, and allows for situations where you take cards directly away from other players.

Not for me I'm afraid.  I'm not a huge card game fan and this doesn't do anything to persuade me otherwise.

I'm not overly keen on the artwork and the gameplay I found to choke all too often.  Constant reading and checking of cards to apply cards abilities.  Move a card from here to there, put into hand, put into pool etc.

For me, I think I'll stick to boardgames - and St.Petersburg which is still my no.1 card game !!

I always wanted to like RftG, somehow couldn't. This one  is definetly better, since it's very interactive: you are constantly involved, basically no downtime. 7 after only 3 initial games with 2 players. Will very likely go up after I understood the combination possibilities of all the different buildings and have played it with more players.

RATING: 8.5
Essentially, GtR is a slightly more complex version of San Juan (and Puerto Rico) in that players can use the cards for a number of different purposes --the card power itself, currency (to bring other cards into play), and markers or resources.  Because of the variety of uses and the number of different cards, a "learning game" before you play "for real" with friends is recommended.

This game is similar to San Juan and Race for the Galaxy.  This one has less of a race feel to me and the combos you can pull off with some of the buildings are crazy.  I think it is easier to have things go really wrong for you in this game rather then others.  The theme seems a little more present and interesting then the others to me.

Loved this OOP game so much that I spent 10+ hours making my own cards and having it printed on card stock, then cutting and sleeving. I made a mistake on the playmats and switched up the Architect/Craftsman actions, but that "version" of the game plays pretty well too! It's interesting, anyway.

Only reason this is a 9.5 instead of a 10 is because, while it's a good game for 2 people, it's a bit strained. Several mechanics break down when playing with less than 3 people. Ideal group size is 4.

Namely, the pool and therefore Legionary/Patron mechanics are often limited in 2P games.

Playing with 5 will somewhat limit building options, but otherwise no notable difference from a 4P game.


This is our go-to game if we only have 30 minutes remaining in a session.

My first rating of this game was 8. Now, after a dozen+ plays I must admit I like this little giant almost as much as Race for the Galaxy (my eternal favorite "pure" card game). The multiuse of cards is fantastic, the flow of the game is extremely friendly and fast paced. If you like games with multiuse cards, like the mentioned RftG, Imperial Settlers or La Granja, then you certainly should try this.

Elsőre nehezen ment a megtanulása, de már az első játék lenyűgözött. Nagyon sok kombinációs lehetőség van ebben a játékban. Szívesen játszanék még jópárat vele, de félek, hogy ezt csak gémerekkel lehet, mert egy átlagember félúton besokall a szabályoktól.
----------

Hát azóta sikerült vele jópárat játszani. Talán a legjobb játék, amit eddig játszottam. Egyelőre nem sikerült még megunnom, ami huszonx játék után nem rossz. Egyetlen hátrányának azt tartom, hogy érzésem szerint vannak teljesen haszontalan épületek benne, illetve, hogy a kék épületek kiemelkedően erősek jellemzően. Így a kő lapok beszerzése kulcsfontosságú, mind a kereskedő ügyfél, mind a jó épületek miatt. Ezen felül még az út szerepe nagyon nagy a játékban.
--------------------------------
30 játék felett levettem 10-ről 9.5-re az értékelést. Nagyon jó játék, de sajnos egy ennyi játék után már beállt, hogy gyakorlatilag csak a szerencse dönt a legjobbakat között. Út, katakomba, villa, szobor: ki húzza fel előbb.

RATING: 5
This needs a couple more plays to be certain, but at first glance it didn't make the cut, and if it didn't come as highly recommended as it is I probably wouldn't even bother to give it another look.

The game seems very arbitrary, and my main concern is not that the sometimes insane card combos exist, but that they are fairly obvious (at least once you know the cards; a huge hurdle when playing the first few times) and where they end up is mostly up to chance, and that the pacing is much too slow for a game of this weight (although I suppose it does get better in that respect with more experienced players).

This game feels different each time and is really variable, yet all those crazy special abilities are anchored in really fun core mechanics that ensure a consistently fun experience. 

Don't worry about balance in this game. Each building is ridiculously overpowered in its own way. Keep an eye on what your opponents are building so you aren't caught totally unawares and have your merchants fed to the lions, but mostly build your own awesome strategy. The game is different with 3 and four players (haven't played with 5). With 3 you have time to build a lot more buildings and can get crazier combos. 4 player is a tighter game and you may only get 2 or 3 finished buildings. 

The flowchart on the back of the player "camps" is hilarious. It's a running joke to turn it over and tell new players that this pretty much explains everything so we can go ahead and start. There are like a dozen lines criss-crossing over one another. It does help make sense of the rules so I appreciate it in the end.

In glory to rome you have dozens of different cards and each of them has the potential to break the game in the right combination. Eac time you play, you will be presented with a very unique set of options and your task is to find the best way to combine them and take advantage.

[i]August 2011:[/i] First Impressions. 9 out of 10.
Fantastic Game! A real gem of a game. I like the card drafting mechanic of being able to choose materials in the pool. The drawings of objects and scenery are good, but the drawings of people are too... whimsical to my eye.  HOWEVER, compelling game play and strategic depth is where Glory to Rome truly shines.

The rules in the booklet are clear and, I found, easy to follow. I had no problems with the game rules after the first couple of games. (Minor quibble: I was disappointed to see glaring typo of a reviewers name. Really, if you're going to bother to add endorsements to your booklet, make sure you get the reviewers name right. This of course, does not affect game play.)

While good with three or more players, I think Glory to Rome isn't as interesting with two players.

The card quality is very good. I won't bother sleeving these cards as the game is relatively inexpensive. The clamshell packaging isn't the best for stacking but it does an ok job of holding the tuckboxes, player mat and rules. The binding of the rules is horrible (one staple? Really?).

Despite the minor quibbles about packaging and art, this game deserves a 9. We'll see if this rating holds up to the test of time.

I enjoy Glory to Rome a lot. The same card can be used in completely different ways which results in a very unique game in my opinion. It has a fair amount of player interaction, and is also pretty lighthearted. They've also managed to make the game quite challenging, while keeping its time frame short.
My only complaint is that things get a bit boring for me after I have a nice, working engine. (Usually a game doesn't take too long after that, fifteen minutes or so)

This game is fantastic. After one play I was like must.own.this.game. I wish it wasn't so messy to teach to new players though.

Also, the merchant ability is half the victory points but it's easy to underestimate the importance until you've lost.

Glory To Rome is a classic card game that is pretty screwy and wild but still has a thick covering of strategy to it. Of course what makes it an interesting game is that each card can be used in one of several ways, and knowing which cards to play for what powers at the right time makes it quite interesting. The game develops slowly but as players gain wild powers in goes of the hinges and fortunately ends before it blows up in everyone's face.  While the way cards can be played was certainly novel for its time and is still interesting, the power combos are kind of annoying and it's certainly not worth the $250 people are willing to pay for the "black box" edition.  However, it is a game that I've enjoyed playing. I wouldn't say it's the second coming of card games but it's an important game nonetheless and one everyone should play at least once. I do wish there were actually fewer combos. The game feels like it was designed to be a decent strategy game but then devolve into a bit of a laugh as everyone has a combination of "game breaking" buildings that prove hilarious when activated but sort of cheapen the meaty-ness of the core mechanics. With a different approach to how building effects work, this could have ended up being one of my favourite card games. Instead, it feels too chaotic and wild to make me want to delve into it that much.

Multum kart, które mają różne funkcje w zależności od tego, czego potrzebujemy. Bardzo ładna polska edycja i grafiki. Planszetki graczy są pomysłowe i niejako służą jako karty pomocy. Może zajmować sporo miejsca na stole, przy czym dobrze jest kontrolować poczynania przeciwnika, bo tuż koło naszego nosa może wykręcić niezłe kombosy. Ciekawe jest to, że można kontrolować koniec gry na swoją korzyść bądź niekorzyść. Czasami zbyt szybki koniec wcale nie przyniesie nam zwycięstwa.

Surprisingly complex game. The production is solid but not completely professional - the cards are functional but they're not Bohnanza quality, for example. The game takes a bit to learn, but it is interesting. I'd rate it higher if it played faster - we played a 3 player game with half the deck, and that took 2 hours and I felt like the game was only just getting started. I'd like to play again, but faster. I don't see any pressing need to play with the building powers (i.e. the complex rules).

Strange that theis designer's games keep getting worse: this game is significantly better than Mottainai but not nearly as good as Innovation.  This game is much more stream lined and the engine is better than Mottainai.  But, like Mottaini, the most Black and white version is ugly.  It lacks the fun of what the cards can do, how they stack and the attractiveness of Innovation (2nd edition, anyway, in terms of art).

Glory to Rome is a solid game, with a similar architecture to San Juan and Race for the Galaxy.  The game play is a little more chaotic, but there are more levels it seems to each decision.  However, with that said the added chaos in this reduces the over all enjoyment for me.  Being forced to possess a card each time an action is taken in order to accomplish that action leans Glory to Rome on the slightly too much luck for time/weight ratio with me.  Poor buildings may come one's way in San Juan, however the system is designed to at least provide opportunities regardless of you present ability - and yes this will ultimately favor those that get better draws.  However, in Glory to Rome, unlike a San Juan or RftG I found myself unable to accomplish anything early in the game because I kept drawing only one type of card.  There are options here to solve this, but all in all I found it to be a slightly less elegant design.  I also felt it outlasted it's time at the table - lending itself to that repetitious feeling.  This however could be a result of a 5 player affair.  Will play again, and my opinion could easily sway either way.  Do I think it worth owning having San Juan, and RftG in my collection? probably not, but time and more plays will tell.

UPDATE:  This is actually a very interesting game, with a lot more to think about than originally considered.  This game might actually become more favored than RftG or San Juan

The only problem with this game is that at first glance it appears to be another multi-player solitaire engine building game. The reason that's a problem is that people looking for that kind of experience can get upset when the game is ended unexpectedly by another player, especially through a win by using a Forum.

The game actually requires a great deal more interactivity than is at first apparent, it's just that it tends to be less direct (although there is direct interactivity with Legionnaires and cards like Prison), and more indirect through control of the pool.

Update: This one is moving up in my rankings as I get further plays in.

Fantastic production quality. The art on the cards is awesome!
Can't wait for my first game.

Unpredictable, but fascinating. Like it a lot.
The core mechanism is as tiny as it could be. During the gameplay you create the game for yourself and your opponent - the biuldings are that strong that actually they recreate the game. I'd compare it to the dendrimeric polimer or a tree with a very think trunk but mammoth branches. Probably infinite replayability.

On the other hand - I feel pretty tired after this game. I do feel tired after a game of Caylus too, but in Caylus I'm shure I've done everything I could. Here, not exactly - the chaos is enormous. Still like it very much.

If you've played San Juan or Race for the Galaxy, this takes those gameplay mechanics to the next level. 

Glory to Rome is a tremendously rewarding game to play, a bit of a learning curve, but everything fits and makes sense. I personally feel like the luck factor is large in this one but there are always options, always something you can do to further your position. Probably my favorite thing about this game is the 'pool'. Each time a round passes everyone's cards go into the pool, which can then be put to use later on. Hard to explain, but just know this game is a real gamer's game, if you're deep into board games this will satisfy that itch for something new.

Clever card game that punches well above its weight.  Have only had a couple of games, will do better now having worked out how the system works.  In the vein of San Jaun and Race for Galaxy, but a bit longer to play.  The cartoonish illustrations do a good job of hiding the serious game underneath.

RATING: 7
Talk about a big game in a small package.  This is a game with a learning curve, and it will take a play to get a feel for it.  Having said that, this game is impressive.  The number of buildings that can be built is overwhelming, but they do provide plenty of room for trying out different strategies.  I also like games with 'multi-function' cards that force you to make tough choices, and this game definitely fits that category.  There is a little to be desired in terms of production, but the artwork is clear and functional and I appreciate the humor.  Don't let the production values dissuade you from getting this very good game.

Update: Still enjoying this one and it gets faster the more ya play it.

RATING: 7
After just a couple of plays, seems like an interesting game. Of course I'm behind the curve (May 2012) and so much has already been written, I'm not going to add anything.

Only further plays will tell if the strategies and play are up to that of Race for the Galaxy. 

Definitely dislike the memory aspect of the Vaults, especially when the scores are so swingy -- huge differences based on remembering correctly what other people put in there. Compare that to a Knizia game that has hidden scoring, like Tigris or Samurai, where the Knizia scoring is much less swingy and unlikely to decide the game if you try to remember everyone else's score. Here, remembering what cards people put it is so vital, because one single card is generally worth 5 points, which is a good 20% of your final score.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game seemed almost the perfect card game upon my first play. The revised artwork is key and sets the tone, stoic and tense. Like another of this designer's games, Innovation, preexisting knowledge of the cards gives veterans an unfair shake. I must play more!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Pretty good card game. Would like to play it again at some point. Ultimately I think it will suffer from the same problem as Innovation, namely that there are too many abilities and too much to read. I think Innovation is more fun, however, and will likely play it over GtR. I think RftG is still the superior game, however, what innovation has going for it is substantially superior player interaction.

So far I am enjoying this game but I have a feeling that it won't last.  while I enjoy games where the cards serve multiple functions, I don't particularly like games where one card can cause the game not only to end abruptly but to be won by the player who played it with no other considerations. 

I've only played 3 times and 2 of the games were won by Forum.  If after more plays I see that Forum or Catacomb usually wins the game, I will probably lower my rating and choose something else to play.

I suspect my rating will go up after a couple more plays but a couple things worked against my first play of this beloved and hard-to-find Chudyk:

-Played with atrocious-looking first version.
-Bad shuffle meant  that I didn't see any Purple (Clientele) Cards or Yellow (Laborer) Cards despite having over 10 cards in my hand. I had to resort to Jacks for the majority of the game.
-Being hamstrung prevented me from getting any kind of engine going so I got steam-rolled.

Clear to say I prefer Mottainai more. I need more plays of GtR to make a more informed decision.

Deceivingly strategic card game.  The rules could use some work (and say that they are a bit confusing initially right in them).  I'd say there's a good 1/2 to 1 game learning curve to fully grasp all that's going on and how well different buildings can interact.

RATING: 8
When I first saw photos of Glory to Rome, I immediately dismissed it without even investigating further. I'm sure I wasn't the only one. The garish "Saturday morning cartoon" art style gave the impression of an amateur effort in the super-lightweight category. It looked like a bush league game that almost certainly sucked.

But first impressions can be wrong. Once I finally tried Glory to Rome, I was amazed to find a meaty and nuanced game. It's a game about managing player-triggered communal actions, in the same family as Race for the Galaxy and San Juan. But those games have a more structured feel. Glory to Rome is a wild ride, with avalanches of cards and points, sudden turns of fate, lots of player interaction, and surprises around every corner. The game often feels like it's on the verge of spinning out of control, but it never quite does.

That looseness is the game's strength, but it also means that Glory to Rome is not a game for everyone. Do you look primarily for balance and elegance? Look elsewhere. Do you enjoy managing chaos and adapting to quick fluctuations? Maybe this is the game for you. Be sure to get the I.V edition, which has some important tweaks to improve play balance.

Seems very random and large decision tree.  Familiarity with the buildings in the game is a distinct advantage like in other games.

Useless cards like in San Juan (ie. 2 cards can be played as Joker).  Spend your time pursuing those buildings and you'll pay dearly later.

Too strong a bias for Craftsman role.

A good game, but it needs to be played more than once to really understand. Especially is the vault under-valued in the first game and all the functions make it difficult. Still the game seems to be both logic and balanced. It's often compared with Race for the Galaxy and San Juan, which both I have played a lot. I can agree that this is a better game. Also my partner really loved this game. Several of my friends says this is the very best card game!

This reminded me of RFTG which I am at present not a huge fan of. It looked interesting and I would play it again although I didn't really understand it that well by the end of one play. I don't like the bright cartoony art very much personally although I'm not one of those people that normally complains about that - it just seemed out of place in this game.

Has the wonderful strong powers of CE, but available to all players, in a San Juan style cards do everything format. The pool is a clever mechanism whereby the state of the game determines what clients and materials are available, and which changes to reflect the different actions chosed at different stages in the game.

Good tension between short and long term planning. Too much opportunistic play will stuff up accomplishing longer term goals.

Plays well with 2. I was surprised. Like it 5 player best.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Man, I really wanted to love playing this game as much as I love its design. Hard to teach, all the different actions and card powers becomes overwhelming for newcomers. Making the best possible combination is a blast, but playing someone who does it is very annoying to me. Game is decided at 70% of its length, and the remaining of the match becomes a rich-gets-richer spectacle.

I can see the appeal, but all the factors aforementioned don't help to bring this one to the table too often.

--------------
[i]Update 06/2012:[/i] Play it only if you want a really brain-burning experience. Casual playing doesn't work here. The rich-gets-richer factor must be controlled by all players, who need to avoid helping each other at all costs. 

About the hard-to-teach factor: just teach it to smart friends. If they don't get it at first then it might not be worth the effort.

Most of the time, if you ask me what game I feel like playing, it's Glory to Rome.

UPDATE: I just played my fiftieth game with seasoned opponents, and it only gets better with age. The game, at this stage, is much less about fretting over the good cards your opponents have and about subtly turning the game to your advantage. I love it. This is probably my favorite game if we're considering just what comes in the base game package.

The interaction of the mechanics is nothing short of brilliant. To play well you must know how your play will affect what is available to your opponent. Ignoring your opponent's strategy is a sure way to lose. The buildings are POWERFUL and each game is a race for that great combo. 

I'm truly amazed by how differently each game can play. With so many buildings to take advantage of and two primary ways to score, the roles that are essential switch from game to game. Brilliant card game!

GTR started out with a lot of promise.  I love a game with cards that do multiple things.  And GTR seems to have the strongest use of this mechanic of any game I have played.  But, the game left a really bad taste.  It took use almost 2 hrs to play with 4 folks.  WAY TOO LONG for a game like this.  Plus, at one point I felt like I was playing Phase 10, need one type of card, so you just draw one card on your turn til you get it, but (and this was my case) it never happened.  Extremely frustrating.

From all the games in the same manner like San Juan, Race for the Galaxy or even 7 Wonders I like this one best. Graphically speaking it falls a bit apart but then the colors are easely distinguisable and one feels that this game was a lot playtested. I hope that one day a big publisher takes hand on this little gem.
Update: ok, now it is also available as a german edition with updated grafics and slight rule changes. Good game with interaction that only in the end gets a bit confusing/too busy/overloaded with cards. Let's say it's not that practical if you overview that a fellow player started to build the "catacombs" (a card that ends the game immediately when finished).

The game for people who feel that Race for the Galaxy is just too simple.  The biggest difference it seems is that the "flow" of cards is a lot more complex in this game versus Race.  In Race, you produce goods and you sell them; in Glory there are more things that a given card can mean, and more potential actions to perform on each player's turn.  I don't feel that the added complexity is necessarily a good complexity, but the game isn't bad either.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Two things make Glory to Rome a 10 for me.

1. When played with seasoned players, it is a consistently tense and rewarding game.  Almost 100% of the decisions you make are seriously important, and it feels that way.  But more importantly ...

2. I continue to learn new things when playing, even after dozens of plays.  The game is deep because the meaning of each card play, and the utility of each building, depends massively on the entire context of play---not only on what's on your own board, but also what's on everyone else's.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I certainly liked it, but I'll need more plays before I've got a good handle on it. I like the multi-use cards and the multiple paths to victory. I think there's a lot of room for variety both in gameplay and strategy. I'm a fan of Innovation, so I expect my rating of this will climb with more plays.

UPDATE: Got the new "black box" edition.
I don't don't know if there is a term to describe this type of game, although I think I've heard "tableau" mentioned before. In essence, this is a complex variant on Rummy. Players have hands of cards that they must play, add to, and transmute to turn them into actions, resources, and victory points. The rules can seem overwhelming at first, but they quickly gel and become second nature. In this way, it also reminds me of [thing=11][/thing]; another game with multi-purpose cards and initially counter-intuitive rules.

The cards offer a variety of play options and combinations so that no two games play the same. Some cards are designed to speed up or immediately end the game, so you can never be sure how much time you have. I read one comment in the forums declaring that the game is "a race to see who can break it the fastest," which seems pretty accurate. 

Overall, a really fantastic and fun game.

This is one of those games where there are five things you would like to do during your turn, but you can only do one or two. There's a nice amount of player interaction. You can make long turn plans without the opponent completely derailing you, but it doesn't feel like side-by-side solitaire.

3, 2 player games, and I'm starting to see the fun.  Not quite as fun as Innovation (so far), but Innovation took quite a few plays before it was fun too. 
I'm hoping this one sees more action because I love the card art and I know there's a very good game here.  During the last game, my opponent took 27 Craftsmen actions to end the game and I still only lost 38-34.  Shows that despite the wild card combos, the game can be balanced.

I'm a huge fan of role-selection games like [thing=28143][/thing] or [thing=8217][/thing], When I first heard about GtR I thought it would be the perfect game for me: Multiple roles, building up production engines, multiple pathes to victory.  Yay!  Then I played it and got seriously hammered.  Played it again; lost again (even more badly).  From game to game it became more frustrating.  For me this game is too chaotic, too dependent on getting the right (powerful) card combos. I know that hundreds of enthusiastic geeks can't be wrong but if I follow BGG's rating scale, I need to give a "1" to Glory for Rome because you won't catch me dead playing it ever again.  However, the game is probably not 100% broken so I mercifully raise my rating by one point.

Glory to Rome is a game that meets its reputation.  Each card offers lots of options and the lead/follow mechanic forces each player to pay close attention to what their opponents are doing.  

The obvious downside to the game is the artwork; the original IV edition is poorly illustrated with garish colors and the Black Box edition is overly simplified to the point that the cards are difficult to distinguish from one another.  The European art, on the other hand, is stylishly cartoony and works well for the game.  If an English reprint ever happens (HA!) I hope they can use the Polish/German artwork.

This is a fantastic game.  It is not a $200 game as the current market price suggests, but it is a fantastic game.

I must say I'm impressed. Similar to San Juan, but with more variety and options; also more fun, so far as I'm concerned. Luck of the draw can only hose you if you let it. Also, exploiting card combos in this game is not optional or beneficial, it is 100% necessary; you can't just play a building for the heck of it. Not quite as fast or fun as Race for the Galaxy (then again, what is?), but still awfully good.

I also received the added IV edition cards via the Black Box edition that was on Kickstarter in 2011. The bonus cards are not the same size as the 2007 Cambridge edition cards. They are close but the new cards are rounded corners and the 2007 Cambridge cards are not. But with sleeves this is not a problem in gameplay.

This is a deep card game that throws in an element of Fluxx - your perfectly built tableau can be worth nought if you fail to see another player sneaking to a different victory condition. The limited options here work, as you soon work out which combos to keep an eye out for and how you should try and move towards your own victory. I've downgraded it over time, as too many things have to fall into place for it to be satisfying - I've had more bad games than good ones, simply down to the massive randomness. You also have to rely on other players playing well, which is never something I like in a game.

A great game from the san juan / RftG family with some other stuff thrown in.  Crazy combos (instead of crazy individual cards, like in san juan) and a very cool resource system create a huge number of strategies and paths to victory, unlike the more limited strategies of san juan.

The packaging is crappy but the game isn't that difficult and its quite meaty for an hour long game.

Don't know how we never heard of this game before!  It's vaguely akin to San Juan and Race for the Galaxy, in that you use a card either for its role, or it's building, or its building material.  It takes a game or 2 to understand the rules and know what cards are available, which is not nearly as bad as RftG, which I still can barely figure out!

Some of the buildings are stunningly powerful, like the one that gives you +4 cards, or +2 clients, or allows you to steal from all other players (not just neighbours), and steal from their hands *and* their stockpiles!  The key to the game is usually having enough points to put several valuable cards in your vault, probably getting +3 bonuses for pluralities.  A laborer/merchant strategy could work, although merchants are rare (because they are also stone).  But I guess a craftsman client strategy is better, because the building materials (in your hand) are not so dependent on what other players play.  Legionary is a very useful thing to do to get valuable cards out of people's hands and into your stockpile, especially with the building that allows you to steal a client from other players and put it in your vault!

No game does it like GtR. The unwieldy equilibrium of victory is genius, which for me gives the game its flavor and place. The production value could be higher, but is disproportionate to how often I will play it.

Though GtR can be discouraging for new players, everyone should play (at least) 3 times before giving up on the game.

You need some time to get used to gameplay. I recommend not to use buildings the first couple of games in order to learn the mechanics. After that, this game really shines. You have to adjust your strategy each game, depending on the number of players and the cards you get. I do not mind the artwork.

Edit: from 8 to 9. I have to admit I love this game, and every gamer that has tried it likes it.

A lot of difficult choices to make, as you may use a card in multiple ways.

As per the suggestion in the rules, play your first game without using the abilities conferred by the buildings, so you may grasp the "flow".  In my first game I had a hard time selecting between Architect and Craftsman, as one allows you to play a card from your hand while the other is from the stockpile.

Definitely worth a few more tries as there are a lot of possible combos!

RATING: 7
Of the multiple role-selection, multiple use card games out there, this one is my favorite. It has a fair deal of intricacies, as well as opportunities for plays that enhance your abilities in the future, as well as possibilities for interfering in your opponents' plans (the later here really differentiates this game from it's peers). The lead/follow mechanism is also very well implemented: you always have options at your disposal (and the choices aren't always simple). While the 2 player game isn't as tense as Chudyk's Innovation, it still holds up relatively well when compared to San Juan.

Also worth noting, the CFG Black Box edition of game is beautiful as well as very functional -- a triumph in aesthetic design.

After i fount an introducing video on youtube about Glory to Rome. I immediately got really exited with the game. I already played it more than 200 times and im planning to play it more. This is my and even the group number 1 favorite game so far. I rode so many forum topics of how to win, and the group evolved really well. This game became like chess: if you ask for this i must ask for this to prevent that and every member of the group play like this even in co-op if this is the only way to prevent someone to win with catacoms. While firstly i tought it can be a bit unbalanced but it's not true. I think the game is about to find a great combination of buildings as fast as possibble, like a race. 

Pros / Cons:
-I really like the mechanics of the game, as a card can be used like 5 ways and this also gives the deepness of it.
-Due to the clever mechanics there is very low or absolutely no downtime, you are always involved with the role selections.
-It has huge replayability there are never ever two games the same or similar.
-I love the theme to build the burned Rome.
-The hungarian artwork is outstanding.
-And as the cards flows i feel like the luckfactor in the game is on the lower side which is a big plus.
-It plays around 1-1,5 hour with 4-5 players, and not as preferred with 2.
-The best price / value game so far, in hungary it is with Carcassonne price tag.

Won in geeklist auction.  An awesome game, with the strategy of Race for the Galaxy, but far more designed interaction, and a level of cartoon silliness above cutthroat reactive solitaire play.

Teaching my daughter to play today- she likes RFTG- and I was far ahead until she dropped a Forum on me. Great fun!

Lowered to a 7.75 for randomness- GtR is still a fun game, but I don't find enough predictable control to keep it at the same level as Chudyk's even better Innovation.

Cards that can mean one of four things--that made my first game somewhat confusing, but I was resigned to losing, and losing badly. However, I came in 2nd! The cards denote one of six roles you can play (like in Puerto Rico), six building materials, or an assortment of victory points. There's definitely a path (sort of like Container) of getting pool cards into your stockpile, which can then be used to build your buildings, or stock your vault with gold, or to get the cards from the deck into your hand, and then into your buildings, or from the pool into your clientele. Confusing? Yes, initially, but it makes sense after a period of disorientation. I'm put off by that, but it looks like a puzzle worth trying to solve. Let's try it again soon...

Update (03/10/09)- 2nd play somewhat less confusing. Still came in 3rd in a 3p game. Game was quicker, but still the mechanics are confusing, as I was admonished for messing up my plays. Oh well. One more time...

Update (03/13/09)- 3rd play. Still mastering the flow of play... the architect and craftsman are similar but act differently! Getting better. Still got crushed--last place in a 5p game.

Update (06/12/09)- 4th play. Have mastered the confusion of the architect and craftsman roles. Built lots of buildings, by getting several craftsman as clienteles early, and getting key buildings set up for 7 card hands, and doubling of clientele actions. However, still lost in a 5p game to the player that managed to squirrel away tons of patron cards in the vault for 35 pts! Ironically, three of us tied at 21 pts. Still working on this.

Update (06/17/09)- 5th play. Finally! Quietly collected six different clienteles and then suddenly completed my Forum for the win! Having the Aqueduct definitely helped. It seems vitally important to build key buildings to help you win--not just any old building.

Update (01/20/12): My initial rating was a '7'. Upon a long reflection, it is a '5'.

After a single play of the Black Box Edition:

I love tableau games with multi-use cards ([gameid=8217], [gameid=28143], etc.) so this one's right up my blood & vomit-spewed alley... with a really nice statue of Bacchus at the end.  Of course, it's mostly made of rubble, but who's to know but the architect and laborers?  And I had them all, uh, "exiled".

I've always been drawn to the theme and play style of [i]Glory[/i] while being successfully repelled by the hideous clip-art/cartoon "artwork".  The Black Box Edition is absolutely gorgeous, with a very hip mid-century modern graphic design vibe.  And oh, man, can I dig it.

Ordered immediately after first contact and practically vibrating with excitement to see how my regular group takes to it.

[b]After 6 plays:[/b]  Would that I could be but the Rubble Baron, for at least that has a whiff of the Patrician to it.  But alas, lying here alongside a stout and world-wending road without thumbs and sore where the boots have found me I am possessed of nothing but the fact that every road needs a ditch—these things are necessary, and I am clogging up the works.

THIS GAME IS AS BROKEN AS MY SPIRIT

This game would have done better - 8 or 9 if it wasn't for some of the unbalanced end game.  In the games I played the winner always used the 1 building of each color to win.

If all the players know this they can rush out and try to make sure they get this card.  Unfortunately it is very difficult to win otherwise in my experience.

The game has a great mechanic and rewards different styles of play: hold all your cards and control the center pot, or play as fast as you can to get the refill hand draw to maximize the amount of cards you get.

Unfortunately the cards are very busy.  They make good use of card economy having them represent different possible uses, unfortunately that makes them full of information that may not be applicable.  You read a lot about a card when it may ultimately only matter in the color of the card.

After hearing about this for so long finally got to try it out. I liked it. I found it superior to Race for the Galaxy. Race feels more plodding, whereas the explosion of combinations in this makes the game feel more wide open.

Seeing it in person, I didn't mind the artwork at all. You don't focus on it much during actual game play and anything more serious wouldn't feel fit the gameplay so well.

My problem with this game is that given my game group I doubt I'll ever play it often enough to remember all the ways you can win and what everything does.

Jó játék. Első ránézésre könnyed játéknak tűnik, de egész komoly játék, van benne jócskán taktikai lehetőség. Ugyanakkor hátránya, hogy nagyon hosszú ideig tart. Másfél órás legalább a játékidő, és volt még ennél több is. 

Ennyi játékkal a hátam mögött már más a véleményem. Éppen, hogy gyorsan véget érhet a játék. A katakomba szerintem felesleges lap a játékban. Teljesen kiszámíthatatlanná teszi a játékot, nem tudni mikor ér véget. Hiába van jó kombinációt, ha valaki leépíti a Katakombát rögtön véget ér a játék. Másik nagy hiba a kézműves lap erőssége. Hiszen az épületet is tud kezdeni és hozzá építeni kézből. Míg az építész csak a raktárból tud, ahová csak a piacról tudunk munkással anyagot szerezni, azaz plusz egy kör a kézműveshez képest. Úgy kellene, hogy alapozni csak építésszel lehet és kézművessel már csak ahhoz tudnánk hozzáépíteni. Emiatt 8-ról, 7-re változtatom az értékelésemet.

Anna has been trying to get me to play by saying I might not like it and comparing it to Race for the Galaxy. It does have a vague similarity to Race (cards have multiple uses, the action one person chooses affects everyone and you are building an engine) but it is more interactive.

It felt a few turns too long and in the last few turns there was little choice.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A variation on Race for the Galaxy/San Juan with the added complication that the same cards provide actions as well as materials and buildings. It's all fairly wild and wacky, the building powers are completely crazy and you can rack up stupid numbers of cards or actions. I'm no fan of the cartoony graphics in the first edition, but I suppose they go with the adolescent atmosphere of everything else. There's no point going in with a strategy, you've got to play the cards you get and take opportunities as they arise. Don't be deceived into thinking that this is a building game, it's in putting materials in your vault that the game is won and lost. Plenty of light fun here, but this isn't one to rank with the classics.

The recent Black Box edition is barely an improvement on the original. If you can get a copy without bubbles in the box wrap and staining on the player aids, the graphics are no more than clip art.

An interesting addition to the San Juan/Race for the Galaxy style of game, though I'm not sure that we need more games of this sort. Goes too long for what it is and that artwork is hard on the eyes. Some cards have crazy powers which makes me like it more than San Juan, but it doesn't come close to the more polished RftG.

Fun card game.  This reminds me quite a bit of San Juan, but it's both goofier and more complex.  The big difference is that the same power can come up several times in a round. The card powers seem very strong across the board, which definitely adds to the goofiness factor.  The cards are played in relation to a player mat that makes the idea of city building somewhat more concrete.  Can be frustrating if you can't get the card with the role you need. Patron very strong.

My first impression of GtR was an overwhelmingly positive one. I enjoy the multifunctional use of cards which can be played as actions and discarded, used to create buildings, or used as permanent buffs that allow additional actions. Each building of 6 different suits can affect the game in many ways and allow for some pretty impressive power ups and combos. The game is quick to learn, but I can clearly see it will take me a long time to become familiar with all the possible routes to victory. One other aspect is the artwork, which is a gorgeously minimalist style. This low detail art may not appeal to everyone, but  I throughly enjoy it. There's a lot of terrific player interaction, and in the style of Race for the Galaxy or Puerto Rico, every action you choose allows others to take actions of the same type. GtR doesnt feel at all derivative however, and is a fresh take on the resource management, kingdom building genre.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Masterpiece: a card game which draws on the best parts of role selection games like San Juan, but really ups the interactiveness by giving players the option of whether to follow the role or to draw cards instead. Add in the extra layer of patronage, to get free uses of specific roles, and even the action system is highly open to manipulation and individual strategy. Once you get experienced with the game, that manipulation of actions and especially controlling the pool are absolutely central to the game - it makes it a truly competitive and head-to-head experience where you always have to pay attention to what your opponents are doing (which I so much prefer to multiplayer solitaire sort of games). And that's before you even mention the combos based on buildings! (My own favourite is the Sewer, which lets you put cards used to lead or follow straight into your stockpile: combined with the use of multiple cards as wilds, it gives you a truly formidable stockpile engine).
The only negatives are the fact that it's tricky to teach, and the occasional duff game when things don't quite click properly (for whatever reason). Also, in 2-player games (which most of mine are) the legionary is significantly less powerful - but I think the game's probably best with 3.

A very fun card game.  Cards can be used in several different ways:  1) Build it as a building in your tableau for a powerful special ability, also you get victory points and increase your influence as well! 2) play it as a client to get extra actions 3) use cards as material to pay the construction cost of a building 4) stash cards in your vault for victory points at the end of the game.  Glory to Rome presents players with a rich variety of interesting options to choose from on their turn.  There are several different viable strategies you can try to win the game.  The game is also good because it is a stimulating, crunchy game, yet it doesn't take a very long time to play.  Glory to Rome can be a bit overwhelming for new players to learn, even serious gamers--yet, once you understand how it works, it is not an overly complicated game; it has a glaring elegance.  It does what it tries to do quite well.  It is interesting that the broad variety of buildings you may construct, some of them are crazy powerful and there are probably buildings that combo really well together--I do not yet know them yet as a relative newcomer to Glory to Rome.

A "cards with text" game.  The multi-use cards, building options and multiple different roles create a game with a lot of degrees of freedom.  With lots of degrees of freedom, however, comes a need to play a few times to get an understanding of the different card powers and dynamics of the game.

Bumped the rating up a bit after a few plays.  The game is starting to make more sense.  This genre of game is not my strong suit though.

May08: Well, only one learning game so far.  I'm intrigued, but not really impressed.  It just feels so much more convoluted than RftG, and not that much deeper.  Still, I'll give it a few tries with the building powers to test it out.

Jun08: Got one full game in, but with all newbies.  I didn't anticipate how much space this takes up.  Also, I'm just not that impressed yet.  It doesn't move super fast due to so much unfamiliarity.  I can start to see the inkling of some neat strategies to try, which is a good sign.  I'll definitely be trying it more.

From 8 to 9.5.

I just love this game. Why?

- Players are involved on every turn.

- Allows for creative play. I can work out what I want to do and often have multiple ways to achieve this. However, this is heavily influenced by what the other players are doing and one must quickly adapt.

- I can easily teach this. This game is an odd duck, but it clicks with me and I'm able to explain it well.

- The thematic tie ins between the building and their actions. I giggle when I think of the Coliseum or Bath and their abilities. Or the Sewer or Senate.

Things I don't like?

- Although can be taught easily, there is a learning curve regarding the brutality of some card combos and their counters.

- Availability. Yeah..

- Perception of a chaotic, luck-festival with a bit of randomness. Chaotic, it can be. But I think experience flattens this some.

- Availability again. Yeah...

Wow this is fun. Between this, Innovation, and Impulse, I've become a big Carl Chudyk fan. I think what I like is that these three games have engine-building as a component, but that isn't the whole game: There's also player interaction, an element of chance, and the constant feeling that something wild could happen on the next turn. Keeps it all very fun rather than dry, but also really burns your brain.

Wow, there is a great deal to this card game.
I look forward to playing it a great deal more in the futre.  I love the multi uses for the cards.
I disagree with the suggestion that there are broken cards.  If there were only 1 or 2 powerful cards then sure, if one player got them it would be a sure win and thus broken.  HOwever, in this game there are many powerful cards so everyone has a good chance of getting something and if played at the right time in a certain way can be very effective.

First try with 5 players. Glory to Rome has a strong theme. The humourous approach is reflected in the comic artwork which, alas, falls far behind the gold standard set by Albert Uderzo. Glory to Rome shares some basic mechanics with San Juan and Race for the Galaxy, but is significantly different from both of them to merit a place on the game table. It is too early for me to judge the game itself, but the first impression was positive.

OK, I definitely see why the game is compared to San Juan and Race for the Galaxy.  You use your cards as currency, as well as for their actions.  In this game, you also use them for roles.  Its more interactive than Race.  There are definitely ways to attack other players.  It has more depth than San Juan.  There are certainly at least a dozen different strategies to explore.  But it is also a longer game.  It holds up OK, as downtime was not too bad.  But, for an hour and a half to two hour game time, I am not sure it packs enough punch.  That said, its clever and if you like either Race or San Juan, definitely worthy of your attention.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
From the descriptions I expected something like Race for the Galaxy.  This is much more complex than Race and more complex than the images make it appear.  It actually is a little clunky to learn as every card has so many different uses.  However, I think in the long run this may end up better than Race, but only if I can convince others it is worth the extra effort to learn.

Very unintuitive game at first.

Mechanics is quite fresh, but it doesn't matter.

There are serious flaws in the design:
- cards enourage you to create many interesting combos, but the game is too short make more than 1-2 of them.  And the rest is just loading the goods into the treasury.  Nothing more in the game...  Despite the promise, the game is one-dimensional...
- interlocking abilities/combos are often complicated making it very difficult to track what's going on at others' play areas
- siginificant downtime
[because of the need to follow others' complicated combinations and the general downtime, max. 3-player game is sensible]
- some players can get better cards/buildings than others and thus they will be impossible to beat

I'm not a combo-fan, but even if I was and all above weaknesses weren't true, I'd be actively avoiding the game.  It just doesn't excite me in the slighest degree.  When playing it I'm deadly bored and only pray for others to make their moves fast so that we can finish the game ASAP.

Maybe it's not as bad game as I picture it.  Maybe it has decent mechanics.  Maybe it has appeal for many, but I'm surely not one of them.  I'm strongly repelled by the game after 3 plays.  It's totally not for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
initial rating 1 play 5 players

Quite a good card game here, I have played San Juan and RFTG so I can compare a little. 

Definitely more going on here than SJ but pretty much on par with RFTG. Quite a few combos can work for you here really ensuring different paths to take. Nice interaction compared to the other two, a little more at least and a dash of screwage as well. 

I think this should also scale well like the others but not sure about the actual 2 player game, I suspect 4 to be the sweetspot and I think my rating would be higher had my game been with 4 as 5 dragged just a little. Right now my preference is for RFTG but maybe that is due to the added control, keep in mind I wasn't keen on Race at first either and I have only played this once so far. 

Rating will most likely rise some with more play including the 4 player game.

Confusing play and wild swings from card powers left me under-impressed. My experience had me making less than optimal plays because of a 'getting/placing which card where enacts which function when' mental block. The card multiplicity never gelled for me; a problem I never had with SJ or RftG. I can easily imagine that further play would alieviate some of that cloudiness and consequently raise my rating, though my concerns about chaotic swings from building powers/combos may still hold.

Edit: Rating dramatically lowered after second play. It appears that the text on the card is not true and for some cards you should look into the rules and read what they say. And they sometimes contradict the text on the card (Colloseum).

This is a great game- probably the best card game of 2005. Gets better with every play. In Glory to Rome the players are managing cards through various states via the now ubiquitous role selection mechanic. Glory to Rome is better than Race for the Galaxy and San Juan. The card graphics and quotations are delightful too. Best with 3-5.

This is a fun game of wild combos.  There is a large luck component so you should think of it as the sort of game where you go into it looking for a broken combination of cards and then running amuck with it.  The cards play multiple roles in the game, which can cause confusion for new players unless they are savvy gamers.  Once you get the hang of it, it is a pretty quick light game.

I get it - but I just caught this one on a bad day.  I was tired, we were trying to teach it to ourselves, and chaos ensued.  By the time someone straightened us out, my reaction was "I see the potential here" rather than "hey, this is good, I'm enjoying this decision-making tree."

It seems like most of the decisions regarding what to build based on my options were self-explanatory, but surely that was due to my newness.

RATING: 9
A wilder version of San Juan / Race for the Galaxy.  Clearly not as tightly designed as either of those, but it places a focus on having a good time and succeeds there nicely.  The game starts slowly, and then as buildings are completed and the clientele accumulate it explodes into a combo-fest.  In some games that would be a bad thing, but that seems to be the point of GtR.

Out of two friends who like Race as much as I do, one of them loves GtR and the other hates it.  I think that GtR is great.  It's an economic snowball engine on meth, with some solid hand-management and depth added in.  It's not supposed to be a "this is serious business" game.  The attitudes of the players are important to enjoying this.

Most of my plays have been with 2.  I've played it once with 5, and it was great.  The Legionary role comes into its own with that many people.  A client or two and a Bridge, and suddenly that role can become a wrecking ball.

I like this card game enough to buy it after my first play. The Roman theme is pasted on, but the mechanics are solid.

Note: Obtain a laborer and architect as clients early. Increase hand size is a priority. Use the vault. (I won with high vault value over a much superior building strategy 14 vault + 6 bonus = 20 total vault). Get a Merchant into the client pool near the last third of the game.

I like the 'cards are everything' idea.  It sort of takes San Juan to the next level, but something about it (that I can't put my finger on) is keeping it from being an 8 or higher.  Maybe the new edition will change that...

Edit - I'm liking it more with each play.  I'll probably pick up a copy eventually.

Interesting trying to manage all the different functions of the cards, and deciding which way to play them.  Some of the buildings seemed like they might prove unbalanced in certain circumstances, but I didn't run into any actual issues with card balance.  Update: it took me several years to play a second time, and the person giving me a refresher said, "and the buildings are imbalanced," almost as if that was a feature instead of a bug.

Seems like LOTS of rules, and lots of rule modifiers that it reminded me of Fluxx in a way.

This is for the HomoLudicus version of the game. It is still a very good game with minor rules changes, the art is gorgeous BUT it often leads itself to be confused, a situation you didn’t have with the original art of the game. 

Another weak point is that the Glory to Rome expansions aren’t compatible with this release.

For these two factors I have reduced its rating.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (November 2010)

This game has been growing on me, my second favorite card game (after RFTG), the mechanics can be hard to teach but the game is really simple and it is an strategic/tactic gem. I think I am in the minority here but I really like the original artwork, and dislike the Black Box one. The good thing about Glory to Rome is the great number of aspects that play very well together, you have role selection, lots of player interactions, some luck, card combos, hard decisions (do I lead this role, build this building or use it as materiel) among others. All of this completes a very good and complex game which is why it is very challenging to do well. I totally recommend it.

My only complaint (although a very minor one) is the game box, I have seen many cards get damaged during shipping due to the box.

Bottom line, Glory to Rome is a gem, but you need to give it the chance to amaze you, you need to play this at least 5 times to really see why it shines.

My group calls this game "IMBA". In a way, its true. However, it makes for some really exciting games especially when the game has a tendency to suddenly end.

We can't get enough of this!  Could play daily if time allowed.  We even love the cartoon-like art on the cards.  It has a fun flavor, and the cards are easy to recognize from across the table.  No problems telling colors apart like in other games.

RATING: 9
Card game in the same genre as San Juan and Race for the Galaxy, in that the cards have multiple uses (role selection, buildings, building materials, bankable money), and it's up to you to decide which cards to play in which roles. Completed buildings give you additional powers which make the difference between winning and losing.

Game play is smoother than it at first seems. The complexity comes through players often having a lot of options from which to choose.

Rated 7.5 after 1 3-player game with all new players, suspect this could rise with further plays. 2 of the 3 players liked it (including me), the third didn't.

Production isn't of the highest quality, and the cartoony artwork suggests a lighter game than is actually the case, but it's nice to see a small outfit publishing a good game that seems to be becoming a sleeper success.

Played once and probably won't play again anytime soon... wow, are some of the 'special abilities' of the cards borderline broken!  Get the right buildings built early and you can coast to an easy win.  There doesn't seem to be any way to stop an apparent leader either... especially if he has a few powerful cards.

Others in our group really like this one, but it's definitely not my kind of game.  It's like Munchkin on steroids.  Great if you manage to get the right cards at the right time; not so great otherwise.

RATING: 8.5
This may not be as tightly designed as SJ or RfG; but it's the most fun of the whole genre!  It feels like someone oiled up the squeaky joints on those other games-- more cards, more number of powers, more extravagant powers, (therefore, more combos), more steps to build things, more ways to use roles. "San Juan meets Magic," as one of the creators said. The cards don't break the game; rather it's a race to see who can break the game first. 
Because of its complexity (740 two-card combinations, tens of thousands of three?), GtR works even better than its cousins for 2p. (I recommend learning with 2p before attempting more.) There are no "obvious choices" like SJ. I normally don't like such complex games; but with clever design (exposing different ends of the cards under different sides of the player mats) this is really a model of elegance.
I know the art is roundly criticized; but what critics ignore is how amazingly functional it is--the bright colors work really well to visually simplify the complexity. The I.V. ed player mats are a model of elegance, telling you exactly what and where you need to do for each role. I find the cartoony art consistent with the exaggerated cartoony powers. An extravagant game needs extravagant artwork. (This is superman, not chess.) The instruction booklet is excellent too.
Biggest worry is that underneath it will turn out to be shallow, and that the strategy won't get much beyond "this combo counters this combo, how do i get it and prevent them from getting it?"  But too early to tell.

Glory to Rome is a very impressive design, but not all that fun as a game. The amount of synergy among the various roles/mechanics/structures is staggering. Cards are quite "busy" in terms of text/icons, so can make for slower play with first-timers. Not incredibly complex, but not especially intuitive either. It takes a full play to see how the various card interactions work. A remarkable achievement in terms of yielding so many possibilities and strategies simply with a deck of cards, but leaves me feeling a bit dry.

It is hard to assess Glory to Rome without comparing it to San Juan and Race for the Galaxy. I do enjoy the role-selection/multi-purpose card play of all these games. I did play them each in order of complexity and have been increasingly impressed with the possibilities these mechanics offer. But Glory to Rome is the first one that has truly impressed me. (RftG is impressive as well, but really the game is too short, which is why I score it a point lower.)

Rome crams all sorts of uses into a single card - roles, clients, foundations, materials, influence, special abilities. The victory conditions ensure a longer game than Race, which has a huge effect on the quality of play. In Race, you pretty much have to pick a strategy early and play it out. If you try to shift gears partway through, you're done. In Rome, there is more time to assess your strategy and shift gears if it isn't working, or react to what other players are doing - all of which makes for a more thoughtful game. I like that the player who invests in clients is the one who gets the extra actions, and you don't get bonuses for simply being the leader. Being able to select the role is your bonus, plus in some cases order of play is an advantage as well. The fact that the discard pile ("the pool") is actively in play is a fantastic innovation. I think it is a VERY solid strategic card game. The design is a bit garish and it takes time to grok, but it's worth it.

Very intriguing game that I think may eventually become one of my "10"s.  I like this design's take on the multiple card usage even more than San Juan or Race from the Galaxy.  I think the hand management options have more depth and the interaction is also higher than those games.  Like those games, it is one of those designs where you must try to develop the best victory point engine. UPDATE: After a handful of games, I am upgrading my rating to a "10".

I had this for a long time but never played it as it has some of the worst rules ever. 

I was offered a trade for Mystery Rummy: Jekyll & Hyde. As that was out of print and Glory was about to be re-printed I accepted.

Of course after trading it I finally got to play it. I enjoyed it and now feel that I nearly understand it. So now I have it back again.

First play, rated 4.5, the different uses of each card seemed almost overwhelming and I was't sure I was interested enough in the game to deal with the learning curve.

Second game, I've upgraded it to 7.5.  I feel about this the way I do about Dominion: not really my cup of tea, but, it's interesting and challenging when I'm in the right mood and also a lot of locals are very into it, so, I'm happy to play a round when someone suggests it.  Tough learning curve but worth it!

Third & fourth game: upgraded to 8.2.  This game is addictive.  Glad I pushed through the learning curve.  I like the little quotes on each card.

After 11 games: upgraded to 9.2.  Just gets better and better with each play.  Chock-full of entertaining strategies.

OK, I'm making this a 10.  A game for the ages.  Now in my Top 10.

The convoluted and complex presentation of the rules with its numerous spelling errors and glaring inconsistencies make learning GtR very difficult. And I thought Race for the Galaxy was problematic.

Use these rules to teach: http://docs.google.com/View?id=dgd82tj7_19hq5zc2dh

There is a very enjoyable game beneath the monstrosity of a rulebook. Lots of options and strategies.

The game takes up a lot of table space and tucking cards under the player mat becomes cumbersome near the end of a game. We didn't need to use the leader card at all.

Played a game today where I managed to build the Catacombs in the first few turns and complete it relatively easily. It's pretty hard to beat. Legionary stone stealing or Laborer/Merchant vault stockpiling?

Chris Rao really hit on something when he described Glory to Rome as "more creative and less mechanical." The buildings provide some surprising and uproariously fun advantages in GtR, in contrast with games ranging from Jambo (with it's straightforward card/ware/gold equivalencies) to Race (with it's larger range of straightforward draw/min-max advantages). I'm not sure there are "balance" issues here either, as numerous personal comments attest. Rather, I think the game is designed so that most of the combination machinery can and will spin nigh-out-of-control as the endgame approaches. You can't really single out a card that is "broken" by fastidious Eurogaming standards; the whole deck is potentially "broken." Compare this to Agricola, where superb play barely nets you a decent farm, and the entire game centers around eeking out a few extra actions. In Glory to Rome, you get to run after the warm-up.

Rated a "10" just in time for the new year (2009).  

After lots of three-player games, I'm a tad bit wary of 5-player, although perhaps just with new players. I would like to play several four-player games, though. 

Edit: I rate the 5-player game a 7. A good way to spend 45 minutes, but with 5 you will not hit the full potential of the game.

Similar enough to Race for the Galaxy and San Juan to pique my interest, different enough to be worth having.  I haven't really figured this one out yet, but I like it a lot.  I'm not sure if it's deeper than RftG or just less elegant.  It's certainly deeper than SJ.  

1st Ed production values are crap, but don't let that scare you away from a great game!  I.V is better, though it's nowhere near RftG & SJ.

What really draws me to GtR is how different every game is.  After 20 or so plays, I have yet to play the same game twice.

The cute artwork initially made me think this was a light game, but then you learn it requires plenty of strategy. Once you start to understand the game it becomes a lot of fun. Your cards can be played in multiple ways. On each turn a card is played with a character that has a special action. Other players can follow with the same card, a wild card, or one of their stored matching characters. The characters on the cards allow building, attacking, storing characters, or card transfers into a stockpile, or into a vault. The buildings are built using the same character cards, now used as resources. Cards grant various special powers which are helpul to building. Buildings, cards in the vault, and other bonus determine the winner.

What a fantastic game. Sadly, all the art choices left me let down. I actually own the Cambridge Games prototype, which is ugly as hell, but the game is so varied and original (though it's compared to 7 Wonders in terms of mechanics). Really wish they would do a re-issue of this with some more "authentic" looking art. The anime thing makes no sense, and the minimalist Euro design is a bit dry, but probably your best bet if you're buying.

I am joining the bandwagon. After reading a lot reviews on the geek, I became convinced this would be my favorite card game out of (San Juan, Race for the Galaxy, Glory to Rome).  Now that I've played it, this conviction became reality.  GTR has so many things going for it.  I love that there are so many uses for every card, not just 2 like in San Juan and Race.  I love that there is more interaction, there are so many awsome card combos you can set up, there's just a lot to enjoy here.  I'm confident my rating will greatly go up once I've had more plays

Update: Now after my third play I’m even more excited about this game than I was at first.  It would be no stretch of the imagination to think this game could become the best card game I have ever played.

Update: This is the greatest card game I've ever played

This and Innovation have the same 'features' to some extent (i.e. problems). They are card games with broken combos which swing wildly all over the place until someone happens to win.

Owned and sold before playing it. Reading the rules turned me off but after getting it explained I finally played it. As with all combo card games, this is almost impossible to judge after one game. We didn't see any of the killer combos that are supposedly possible. What bugged me, were the hidden vault cards. Why on earth did they include a memory element into GTR? If I had paid attention to what players put there, I could have won. Not sure, if the bonus VP's matter that much with more experienced players.
I think I like it a bit better than Innovation as it doesn't seem as brutal in its swings but more experience might prove me wrong.

My 1199th rated game!

I really delayed getting on board with Glory to Rome, first because of availability issues, but then because of all the talk about how complicated it was.  It turns out that (at least for me) that claim is unfounded, as it has been fairly easy to teach so far, just by reading the rules.

There's nothing really original I can say about the game.  The theme is laughably thin, completely inconsequential as far as how the game plays.  The artwork is also distracting and on the whole hurts the game.  But I appreciate the relative simplicity of the simple and the obvious potential for different types of strategy.  Sure, the luck of the draw can definitely hurt you, but that can be somewhat mitigated by special powers on the cards.  And even so, the game doesn't last too long anyway.

I do think the game ending cards are a little cheap, especially since you can end the game almost right after having started.

My main gripe with the game relates to the physical production and components.  While component issues are definitely less important than the actual game content and experience, it is definitely annoying putting the game away and the glossy cardstock is cumbersome as well.  If someone released an updated version with high quality cards and a more sensible box (without the stupid tuck boxes), with updated graphics, it would really be a winner.  That said, I'll still be playing this game and enjoying it.

I enjoy the new design. I was never a detractor of the earlier art, though I agree that it does seem amateurish. I much prefer the new art, but it takes some getting used to.

Crazy hard game to learn. Moreso than Race for the Galaxy. So many ways for each card to be used and so many rule-breaking cards.

The base system itself is quite clever I guess, forcing players to focus on 6 different roles. If a player neglects a role, he/she will find themselves missing out on VPs later on. But the game runs too long for what it is (especially if someone doesn't build the catacombs). And its just not as much fun as it's cartoony-art leads you to believe.

First, I was overwhelmed by the different roles and whether I wanted to build or put cards in the Vault, etc. Towards the middle part of the game things came together more or less. I love how the building combos gradually give you more benefits, and by the end of the game you can have amazing combos. The mechanics are wonderful and once you get down the rules the gameplay is very smooth and so much entertainig. There is still a lot to learn about the cards and the possible combos you might be able to build. An excellent game all around.
I love the colours and the artwork on the cards, and the quotations add a fun extra touch to the gameplay.

Nice game! Probably the best of the San Juan/RftG Series. The only thing I would do is perhaps make it more serious. The art is more for the "funny" market - not a serious game like this. 

Nov 2015: Still a very good game. Very easy to teach in today's gaming environment due to a larger influx of games similar to it. The major change I would have kept from the first edition to the limited edition would have been keeping the different philosophical quotes on the sides of the cards - It gave the game a touch more flavour that I enjoyed.

This game defines the meaning of the words "Runaway Leader". Usually you know who's going to win after a couple of rounds, and there's nothing anyone can do about it. But the mechanics are quite nice, and that's a reason enough to play this.

Hard to grasp the crazy combos your first time - and I've only played it once. Still, I really enjoy the card interactions and the fascinating strategic decisions. Stashing cards through patronage is way more powerful than it sounds from a rules explanation, and it's a mechanic I'm going to exploit the next time I play. 

Anyway, I'm going to give the game the benefit of the doubt for now and a 9. It's tremendous. I've ordered the Black Box edition, which I expect to make it even more fun - even left-wingers such as myself can admit the Fascists' talent for graphic design.

RATING: 10
Rich and meaty!!!  Plenty of consequences from your decisions, but still very fluid -- it doesn't feel like there's only one right move.  Games can be very different from each other.  

This already earned my "10" rating before we even started using the building functions on our 6th game.  It's still one of my 3 favorite games now, after about 200 games.  

For comparison, I really liked San Juan and had fun playing it about 70 times before tiring of it.  And I like Race For The Galaxy, but find it somewhat dry and sterile.  But anyway, the cards in Glory To Rome act much more multi-functional, and their movement among the game areas is much more strategic.

I like the cartoony art of the I.V edition that bothers some people.  The austere art of the Black Box edition is boring but fine.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Based on 1 play.  Yes, the goofy powers are fun and can be really crazy toward the end-game.  At the same time, I kept on wondering why we weren't just playing Race for the Galaxy.  Rome is just a bit too wacky and byzantine (groan...) for it's own good.

2014-08-31 - It's 6 after two two-player plays. It's not bad, but I expected it will be better after I read the instruction. There is a lot of buildings and it overwhelms me a little bit. Maybe it's better with more players, but I'm not too eager to introduce it to more people. We'll see.

2014-09-30 - I don't change my rating after third play. Perhaps the game requires more experience to have more control at it, but I prefer to gain experience in RFTG for instance.

I used to think this game was very similar to Race for the Galaxy,  but after a few more plays I'm more convinced that it actually shares more in common with Eminent Domain (a game that didn't exist when I made my first assessment). Let's just agree that it shares common elements from each.

This is definitely a game you need to play once or twice to fully understand everything.  There are a lot of different card powers and play options but they are varied, interesting and fun.  I enjoy playing this game and want to get more plays.  The original artwork is best and fits the theme, character, and gameplay of the game.  I like the little quotes on each of the cards too.

Strangely, Glory to Rome really scratches my Magic the Gathering itch.  It's not similar mechanically.  But the way that the buildings break the rules and the possibility of very powerful building combos make this game diverse, swingy and fun every time ... just like a good set of Magic cards.  This game is much more approachable and a lot more fun than Race for the Galaxy.  San Juan is better with 2 players or with non-gamers.  
***Edit*** I traded San Juan away.  It's an almost perfect design, but it just doesn't have enough bumpiness in the ride to make it interesting and fun in the long run.  Glory to Rome just gets better and better, though.

I really like the central mechanics of Glory to Rome, but it does go on for too long. Usually the game is decided once one player builds up a better client base than the others, but the game tends to continue for 10-15 minutes past this point. The multiple roles of cards blows people's minds for some reason, so I don't know all that many people I can convince to play.

RATING: 6
Finally played this a second time.  The new edition was much more pleasing to the eye!  Not a bad game at all, and "6" seems a bit harsh, as I do see some clever balancing things in the design.  Mostly it fails with me due to it being a card game, and then a game that sprawls all over the table, getting bigger and bigger.  It's not the size per se, but the need for me to know what every card does, and especially to know about the ones that affect my play, and the depletion of the deck.

All that said, it is quite playable, and I would play again if asked.  I just won't be the one requesting it.

Had a decent time with this one, but would shed no tears if I never got another crack at it. Art is a stark, Spartan affair, but it works, even if it seems more like what you'd see on a prototype than a finished product. Plays fast, pairing interesting choices with a hearty helping of luck. Still a sucker for the multi-use card mechanism.

A solid addition to the build your card empire genre. Sufficiently different from Race for the Galaxy and San Juan. There seem to be quite strong card combinations, but that might be part of the charm. The Black Box edition looks really great.

Uses a game mechanic similar to the game San Juan where the cards can be used for multiple purposes.  Part of the tension in the game comes from deciding how to use a card.  This game is a step up in complexity from San Juan.  As in San Juan, a working knowledge of cards in the game makes for a better game.

This game is well-designed, plays quickly, and has just enough interaction (with the Legionary) to distinguish it from something like Race for the Galaxy. I like the Black Box edition, but have no problem at all with the I.V. artwork (except on some of the promo cards). Both versions offer the same great gameplay, scale beautifully and if you're willing to endure some chaos and complexity, a lot of fun.

Easy to learn card game that packs a lot of punch. Full of strategy and with mechanics similar to Puerto Rico and 7 Wonders however, I enjoyed Glory to Rome much more than the latter. Has so much replay value and can be played in about an hour. It's a shame how this game went out of print, but with as much replay value this game has, I think the extra coin to spend to buy a used copy is worth it.

To date, this is my favorite medium weight card game. Cards can be used for a multitude of things and the game can be very interactive. If someone can get a quick combo together, it can be very unbalanced, but that it part of the fun. Some games can last as short as 20 minutes while other could go for an hour. Many games are very close despite the feeling that someone is way ahead and others are a blowout. Never a dull moment playing this.

There are some utterly broken combos. However you cannot plan to get these, it is up to the luck of the draw. Luck can be fine many in games, but Glory to Rome is just too long for the luck of the draw to be the deciding factor. When I am losing I want to feel like I could have done something. Even randomness to this level can be fun sometimes, if the game is short enough that it's over quickly. In Glory to Rome, however, you not only get to loose horribly thanks to shitty draws. You get to do it for hours on end.

Only one play which I won by 9 points. walter ended the game early and I was the only one to have vaulted a colour giving me 5 points for that card. + 2 for a simple building a finished.
 It looked like Mike was running away with it and Micheal and Walter were battling it out for second. 
Walter forgot about my three bonus points handing me the win.

It's a bit much to wrap your head round at first. But after a few turns everything starts to fall in place. This is a game I think you are able to play well after three games but there is still a lot left to improve your game. 

It was a must have before I played it and it remains one.  GOT IT 2010-04-16.

Update july 2015:
Finally got my second play in. And a third will probably follow soon. 

The game is not hard to play at all. the difficulty for new players are the definitions used in the game. Hand, stockpile, pool. And there is no clear reason why one would move from there playing that role besides it says so on your player aid/map.

I have to check the scroing system because I don't understand my initial comment. of five points for one card I vaulted.

The goofy and cartoony artwork of the first edition made me disregard it for a long time. After actually playing it (Black Box Edition), I came to like it, even the minimalist artwork.

Fantastic, crazy game! Love it! The expansions seem to have cut the average game lengths down drastically since there are now more ways to win the game early and those ways seem to be prevalent lately, especially the 'win immediately if you have more laborers than everyone else' etc card.

This game shines because you always have to watch what your opponents are doing, and you have to watch what you give your opponents in the pool. Pure interactive awesomeness. Not nearly enough games have this much interaction and a game like Glory to Rome really makes you realize how a basic gaming need is so blatantly ignored in so many other games.

This game is killing Race for the Galaxy for me, because with Race you kindof just play against the game, not the other players.

Fun and addictive! It even offers the nice feeling of building something which I didn't expect from a card game.

Not for players who like to be in complete control over their fate (luck is definitely a big factor in this game).

Finally acquired the Black Box Edition and am glad I got it.  Though I had to pay a bit more than I wanted to for a what is essentially a card game, the amount of plays I will get of this game will pay for itself.

Like Bruges, I think I'm really starting to enjoy games that utilize multi-purposes cards.  The game just churns the brain in the right way as you have to be aware of what your opponent(s) has in play and what's available in the pool.  So many damn options in a box and I love it.  I can see this one being playing frequently over the years.

Many games, 3p, 4p, 5p.  Wow, was I disappointed with the first 2 games.  One game ended very abruptly (and quickly - maybe 5 full turns), with a Catacomb ending (that player tied for second).  I suppose more games will reveal how to play more defensively, but it'll be tough to convince anybody else to play again.  

And, this turned out to be correct.  2 games under the belt REALLY helped understanding the underlying strategy.  I think 2 games, perhaps partial games, are really necessary to see where the game is going.

This small game has the ability to melt my brain.  The basic cards are used for actions, patrons, resources, building materials, etc.  This polymorph of cards as they are played and change form is deceptively simple.  You can play this lightly, or go complete Analysis Paralysis.  I hate the plastic box but the rest of the components is nice enough and it travels well.  It also scales fairly well as everyone is playing during the others turns and yet works ok with just 2.  It's one of those games you have to try to figure out for yourself.

This is an interesting resource management game. It's really confusing at the start because all cards has multiple use. So it took a while before grasping the concept of the game.

Personally, I thought that legionary is just too strong but there seems to be some defense to legionary compared to laborer.

Some people say that the game is cheap. I don't know, it is actually better than cheap ass games, so I don't have any complains to do. Except the 6 poker chips which are only used once at the end of the game. Anyways, if the components are cheaper fine, the price of the game will drop and games are already expensive so far. 

The only cheap thing I could see is that the board is made of a plastic container. Wow, thats no so bad, dream pod nine actually published games in VHS tape containers which still had the studs.

Glory to Rome is a really great game, with some problems.  It has amazing powers and variety and is amazingly balanced even with this.  It lets you do all kinds of different things that most games don't!  I think it has problems in scoring and being a little sloppy.  The cards in the vault can be too valuable.  I don't like how valuable the blue and purple cards are and how they never come out in the middle much.  Having the most valuable playing cards be the most valuable scoring cards was not the best choice in my opinion.  I hope it is reprinted and fixed some.

Very involved card game in which each card can be used several different ways.  You are seeking to build structures that will grant you special abilities, produce goods which can be stored away for additional victory points, and give you additional actions if you build your "client" base.  Its not actually all that complex, but figuring out the different building combinations and what role to pick on your turn can be a difficult decision, particularly since everyone else has the opportunity to copy your action if they have a similar role card.

When playing Glory to Rome you can definitely feel the lineage the gameplay has, sprouting out of [gameid=8217], which in turn was a sprout off of [gameid=3076]. The overall feel of the game really beefs up what [gameid=8217] has to offer, and throws in a nice dash of Carl Chudyk killer combos to boot. Even though you can feel Chudyk's inspirations throughout the game you also feel his unique stamp on the game through every one of the mechanics.

When first listening to the rules of how to play Glory to Rome your head will swim with all of the possibilities that one card could possibly be, but once you jump into the game and play a couple of rounds the gameplay is very streamlined and moves at a really nice pace throughout. 

The Black Box version of the game is simply stunning to behold, and to me represents one of the greatest achievements in modern game graphic design.

Very good building card game in which each card has multiple uses.  As with other games of its type, it is all about forming the most effective combinations of cards to fuel a VP generating engine.  I like the unpredictability of the endgame.

The card art is not my cup of tea. My interest level bounces back however after they release the Blackbox edition with upgraded professional graphics. While Race for the Galaxy left me cold with the abstractness, the ancient Roman nomenclature should be more relevant in terms of the card effects and specialities. I call this kind a "pathfinding" game and good for multiplayers partying for an hour or so. Strategic depth and extent of interactions among players really depend on the design of the cards play. I am now more optimistic about this game and should get a copy.

I can't feel anything like the variety and depth of Race for the Galaxy, here (only 5-6 buildings, at the end; no thematic coherence between the cards; no brain-burning plans [because of the limited number of powers, and their relatively simple interlocking mechanisms,…]).

Less variety than Innovation (because the board situation does not change very fast), less subtle strategy than Race for the Galaxy (because the Building powers have big effects). However, juggling with the different Roles and their requirements (having a matching Material in Hand for the Legionary, playing a Role knowing it will go to the Stockpile, from where it can be used to build Buildings, etc.) make implementing plans not fully straightforward. Also, keeping in mind the interaction of all the powers in Play is a somewhat challenging: it's easy to overlook something.

I am a little disappointed by how fast a combo from an opponent can put me behind: they are hard to predict and counter.

I appreciate the simplicity of the Black Box edition: the cards are very legible.

Good: interactive, with aggressive cards that force reactions and/or defense building.

RATING: 8
One problem I feel with this game is a runaway leader problem in 2-player games. The feeling is not nice. Games like Race (where the race is often not over until the end) or even Innovation (where one can come back a bit more easily) feel better.

I keep losing, at this game: I like the challenge. I wonder if it is typical to have large gaps between players, which I don't appreciate so much, because I want to feel that fighting can bring a real result.

Interesting upgrade to San Juan. Like that game, the focus is on choosing roles and building sites that give bonuses, but with more emphasis on the actual construction process and more victory paths. Unfortunately it's very difficult to teach since there are many interlocking pieces. also a very long game, but that could be because every game I've played so far has had someone learning it.

[thing=19857][/thing] was was hugely hyped after the reprint was announced, particularly as it was billed as a more interactive [thing=28143][/thing], one of our favorite games.  We tend to like these types of tableau-building games where you get to build up your area with special cards.

We got a new copy and eagerly tried it out...and it didn't quite bowl us over right off the bat.  The cartoony artwork of the IV edition wasn't a problem (we actually like the bright colors, since they helped to distinguish your opponent's cards across the table).

[thing=19857][/thing] has some interesting mechanisms, particularly the common pool cards, which results in some unique card flow.  However, we're not sure that two players is where the game shines---it seems like  it's too few players to make the pool mechanism really shine.  There's just not enough interactivity with two.  We had a game where both of us were very reluctant to discard anything to the pool, so we ended up taking the Thinking action over and over again, which made the game drawn out and boring.  Plus, the "game-breaking" card powers didn't feel all that special.  At least for two, the game felt more like a slow, grind-it-out affair until one player can break it wide open with a great combo and sprint to the end.  In this case, having more players and more chaos might benefit the game.  For now, I think we prefer the better-paced Race, although we'll have to give it a few more tries.

[2009-03-18] My rating here could rise (should). Much more fun than Race For The Galaxy, much more interesting than San Juan. Great components, great artwork (thought busy). The many paths to victory ensure a nicely different game on each play.

I dislike some of the odd wordings on the cards and in the text. For example, it is not intuitively obvious to all readers just what "...as a jack" means, and especially not in all cases. What this means is that the 'object' is played as if it was a jack. "...any three Order cards of the same role (color) as a Jack" is read by some as saying that the 3 order cards must be the same color as the Jack, which makes no sense, and adds unnecessary confusion.

Too bad about the crappy plastic box which arrived in the mail open for me! ...damaging the player mats (DARN - I hate that, almost sent the game back). After some repair work the damage is hardly noticeable.

Anyway, [b]FUN[/b].

[2012-12-09] I sure am glad I got the I.V. version. We happen to like the original cartoony look, and the upgrade from the 1st edition to I.V. is great. Got the 2 added card sets from BGG's store and couldn't be happier. This game is complete for us, and we never need the ugly spartan Black Box edition. Done! And happy.

RATING: 10
The art sucks.  The art beyond sucks.  It's horrendous.  Almost to the point of being offensively bad.  Which is a real tragedy, because this is one of the greatest games I have ever played.  The originality, the strategic depth might be unparalleled.  Every card can be used 4 different ways, and each way then puts it into a different play space for future interactions.  The cardflow is so interesting and so clever.  The building's powers vary from weak and mildly interesting (on their own) to "did I read that right? Can I really do that??" (hint: yes you can).  The game is intentionally "broken," so that it is a race to break it first with an all-powerful ridiculous over-the-top combo of powers, including a few of those aforementioned "weak" ones, which when combined with the right things only multiply the power of others and launch them into the stratosphere.  Tons of player interaction, most of it indirect (a few attacky things do exist). Every play effects the other players, every choice matters.  The game is SO SO SO SO good.  So good.  Fantastic 2 players.  Fantastic with more as well.  Everyone does something on each turn, so the game never drags, even when players sit there trying to decide what to do (because chances are you have a lot to think about as well).

Alas, due to the art, most people will never even give it a try.  I will say, that while very much like a slap in the face, the art fades into the background when you play.  Most cards are stacked in various ways, and you're so focused on the color and text, and you almost don't notice how ugly it is.

A fancy kickstarter alternative art in minimalist style version does exist, although it was $100 at the time and was a limited print run, so... yeah.

Black box edition from Kickstarter.   A decent game but some of the mechanics are difficult to teach/grasp for new players which means this doesn't hit the table very often.

WOW! A very nice card game in the same vein as San Juan and RftG, with a totally different spin on things.

Some really nice, smooth play and interesting interactions.

Should cure my Race burnout for a while, and in tandem with Race almost certainly assures that San Juan won't see much play again.

Update:

Took some time away after a handful of plays of this. Playing other games by this designer, more RftG, and a number of other games really renewed my interest and all those combined skill in the game. 

In all the game is much shorter for our gaming experience not to mention MUCH FASTER. Play time is down to the 40 minute mark.

Just got this for Christmas (2010).  YeeHaa.....then I opened the card boxes, and found one card torn and another that had been bent pretty bad; definitely marked.  Pretty poor "quality assurance".  I'll send off an email to Cambridge Games Factory.  Just got my two replacement cards(I was a little surprised that they were just in a normal envelope, and sent to China that way....amazingly they arrived without being damaged themselves)...Yeehaaa.

Love the game, but just wish another company was producing it.  CGF has a part-time boss that has consistently disappointed me with their production inabilities(poor quality of production, and unwillingness to reprint popular game).  I also believe they totally screwed Carl Chudyk over by going years between reprints when the game was very popular.  Then when he goes with another company and slightly different design, they step in at the last minute with threats of lawsuits.

Completely love the game......want nothing to do with the company (until they go with a full-time boss and redeem themselves....if possible).

The chatter on BGG over the new edition of this game brought it back to my attention and I considered whether I would spring for a copy of the new look version. But after consultation with my wife, I found she preferred the look of the already available version - the clarity of which color cards are which in particular was mentioned. I wasn't too sure about the cartoony art and the possible similarities with Race for the Galaxy, but enough Geeks here praised it that I put some of my birthday money toward a copy.

I can safely say I haven't regretted it. There is certainly room in a collection for both Race and G2R, with Glory to Rom providing a wilder experience, the card combinations sometimes threatening to shut down the game. The encouragement of the publishers to go for it with the combos is entirely in tune with this feeling, even as it feels a bit wrong that these things are so powerful. My feeling is that Race is a better design, but I am enjoying the attempts that I have made so far to grab the reins of this game to make it go where I want, but mostly it takes me and I just hang on.

RATING: 10
High level of player interaction, difficult decisions for how to use one's cards most advantageously, engine building, a potentially high screwage factor, and creative, crazy combos.  Pure fun with the right group.  Best with 3-5 players.  Pay close attention to what sort of buildings your opponents begin to construct, it will influence which roles are most beneficial to their strategy.

The Black Box edition of this game is brilliant.  If you've been holding out because of the cartoonish artwork, then hold out no longer, friend.

This is a tableau building game where cards have multiple uses.  The game has two versions, one with cartoonish art and the other with "serious" art.  It is a brilliant game and with many strategic choices and many paths to victory.  I like the Republic variant a little better than the original game.  It plays differently depending on the number of players but it is a lot of fun. 

Many folks consider it heavy but it is really a medium-weight game.  

Like most card games, the better you know the cards and combinations the stronger you will play.   

You can play the game with the family but you need to take your time teaching and play the simple game at first may be worthwhile.

A lot more going on here than in San Juan or Race for the Galaxy, which are easy comparisons.  40 buildings to learn and figure out interactions.  Plays longer than RftG, which is both good and bad.  I have had the same concerns as others about balance and length of play, but once you play a few times and learn the strategies and counters to them, it balances out and play time speeds up.  This is an hour or so game if you are playing it right.  Although easily overlooked, GtR IV edition should win an award for the most superfluous pieces in the plastic bonus chips.

This is a deep, strategic game with great interactivity, structure combos with various paths to victory, and several clever mechanics to reign everyone in...and every game feels like a story.

So far, this seems just plain fun.  Its cartoon art belies a very deep, AP-inducing game that as of now I will rate a 9.  It is too early to call it a 10, but it very well could end up with that rating.

UPDATE: This game is so deep and strategic, with so many possible combo's of cards and so fun to play that I can't see myself not want to play this game whenever possible as long as I own it.  Perhaps that will change and I'll change the rating, but I think that would not happen until after MANY games....so this gets my first 10 rating.

Not sure about the newest cards, but this is one of the best designed games out there.  Excellent, and re-playable.

The new edition has clean art, which I like.

However, functionally it makes it more difficult to watch what your opponents have, and I find that a little frustrating.  

It may look nicer, but I'd rather have had a better graphical design that looks better (the bar was low looking at the original cards) and was more functional.  For example, make it easier with better icons and use of color to make it easier to see who has what buildings and materials in their stockpile.

excellent abstract card game with so many uses of a single card. The core mechanism still feels fresh 8 years later, and the application is better than almost all followers. Compared with Dominion, this game is simply a masterpiece. Glad that I own a copy.
My copy is the black box edition, which was ordered via kickstarter. Many backers only get their copies 2 years after the game was re-published and that was after a lengthy petition via a BGG thread 'living in Taiwan and still waiting'. In my opinion, CGF doesn't qualify as a game publisher. I would never order anything from CGF again.

A fun card game, if a little chaotic. However, it's description as a "strategic" card game is a lie. There's no strategy here at all. You make the best use of each hand of cards as you get them, then get a new one and work with that. It's all tactical, as there's no way to control or predict what cards you'll get in the future, and the variety of effects is so varied that you can't plan for any of them. There's also only one way to win, apart from some crazy cards that offer a separate win condition, if things happen to fall right.

Surprisingly good game, although the artwork of the Italian version could suggest a childish target. 
For those who are familiar with San Juan, this game is a deeper and more complex version of it. Some gimmicks really shine, like the "hiring" system, and there are so many different buildings which provide a plenty of combos. 
Paths to victory are several, due expecially to some "instant win" possibilities... which generally I don't like but in this game everything is counterable and beatable if you choose well your timing; plus, it adds some tension and the necessity to look carefully at other players' boards.
In conclusion, this is really a "tier 1" card game but unfortunately I find the artwork really annoying.

Very nice game in a small package. Difficult decisions for card usage as building, materials, clients, etc. Interactions with legionaire, the game offers a ton of variety.

[Played twice]

A card game with interesting premises (e.g. think or follow) and multifunctional cards whose appeal seem to be in the general "over the top" powers of many of them (rather than a mesh of finely balanced cards, it is a clash of "absurd combos"; I can see the appeal for some players and albeit I do not dismiss it entirely, it is not my favourite flavour).

Hard to find anything wrong with this game.  We played it with 2, 3 and 4, goes from godd, better best IMHO.
Terrific variety in the cards, more than one path to victory, nice cards with multiple functions, good price, highly replayable.  So glad I picked this one up, ranks better than San Juan, and goes head-to-head with Race For The Galaxy.

Get a copy- this game is top notch.

In Glory to Rome, player choices pool together to gestate in a hyper-matrix of near infinite complexity which eventually achieves sentience, expands outward engulfing everyone, and turns them into probing pseudopods of the new, glistening shared consciousness that continues to evolve into new game states. It is a game design that one must see to believe and be truly enlightened to understand.

Not my kind of thing. The use-cards-in-5-different-ways idea is clever, but I can't shake off the feeling that it's too clever for its own good. Also some buildings seem way stronger than others, but then again, straight conversion of materials to points (in the vault) seems even stronger than buildings, but with only two plays under my belt maybe I should just not comment on game balance at all.
I appreciate the design skills that went into this game, they just don't result in a game that I enjoy.

RATING: 7
Turning a stack of innocent cards into a serious brainburner seems to be a specialty of Carl Chudyk, but getting acquainted with this earlier effort after you already know and love Innovation is a bit of a letdown. Not because the games are too similar - the overlap of ideas is minimal, actually, apart from riding along with the actions of other players - but more because Glory to Rome feels less developed, at least on my first play.

It’s hard to pinpoint what contributed to this, and it certainly is good enough to make me try again in spite of being a bit underwhelmed, but what struck me as the most problematic thing is scaling. We were playing with five players, and the game kind of ended before it started because the draw deck was depleted. There was no real specialization of strategies because no one had more than three clientele cards, which seemed such a potentially fun thing to develop. More problematically, I won the game only due to two bonus VP cards, which I got with exactly two cards in the vault - the other two players who were using Merchants managed to exactly neutralize each other. Those bonus VPs were 6 of my 16 points, and that just feels wrong for so little effort. It probably balances better when playing with fewer folks, but will be even worse with six.

The art does not help, less due to its garishness, but more because the design obfuscates the game mechanics instead of supporting them. Hopefully I can try the graphic redesign for my next play to find out how much of a difference it makes.

Now this is a game I'll never turn down the chance to play. There's nothing like stringing together that perfect set of building combos to take you to victory. After a few plays, you'll get a hang of what most of the buildings do and you can start making your bomb to blow this game wide open.

Opposite of that, there are counters to the big bad bomb combos, there are buildings and other conditions that can end the game prematurely, and this works as a perfect defense against someone trying to tech hard.

The mechanics are simple and intuitive. As you get the hang of it, everything fits into place. The player mats are clear for any beginners learning the game. The mechanics also ensure that no one is really ever sitting and doing nothing. When it isn't your turn, you usually have at least two actions to choose from.

In the end, you can play a civil game, leaving your opponents alone and what not, or you can go for their jugular. No matter the playstyle you like, this game is plain good fun.

RATING: 8
Played twice.  In the first game I was just getting my plan together when my opponent won with the forum.  Second game played out as normal, and was really fun.  I can see how every game would play out quite differently.  It's fun to try and decide on and balance you Clients.  For example, hiring lots of "Merchants" may help you grab lots of points at the end, but not having some of the others will make it harder to get to that point in your plan anyway.

Great game!

A crazy multi-purpose cards game from Carl Chudyk. I like games where cards serve multiple functions as the players see fit and this one is no exception.
The flow of the cards from building, to materials, to workers, etc. can be a bit confusing at first but after a couple of rounds even beginners will be aware of how the game works an should be able to make good tactical decisions.

Mind-bending in a good way. Each card has multiple uses, and the choices with what to do with each are interesting and difficult. There are lots of different special powers that can synergize to form powerful combos, and there's plenty to keep track in each person's tableau. Pretty fun, but a little too chaotic for my tastes.

Finally able to get a couple game under my belt.  The complexity and lack of people in my group who have played before was a barrier to getting this to the table.  That said, this mechanics of the game are quickly learned once you start playing.  The strategy is more elusive.  Each game ended up lopsided where someone got an effective combo while the others were still figuring things out.  I expect this to normalize as people learn what to look for.

That said, this was a whole lot of fun to go through.  I love that there are multiple, viable ways to win and rich strategic and tactical options on how to play.

I LOVE this game! It just feels so fresh, and it seems infinitely repayable. I'm not a fan of San Juan (or Puerto Rico for that matter), I can't get myself to play Race for the Galaxy, and because of that, I was hesitant to pick this one up. I'm so glad I did! The gameplay is dynamic without being overwhelming. The components are quite nice (Black Box version) and I love the minimalistic art style. It's also worth mentioning that there is a TON of game in a fairly small box. If there is a game on my shelf that takes up a lot of space, I need a good reason to keep it there. With Glory to Rome, I don't have to make that distinction. However, if I did, I wouldn't mind if this was the size of Twilight Imperium 3rd Edition or a Carcassonne Big Box. I don't think everyone will like this game, mainly because, in my opinion, many won't explore the game sufficiently (it can be somewhat overwhelming your first time). Regardless of this, I think Glory to Rome deserves a spot on every serious gamer's shelf. I paid over $100 for my copy, and would have paid twice that in hindsight. Nevertheless, I hope that the publisher re-releases this gem!

Update 8/22/15: 

Played this again with my wife tonight. It's such a cool game. I just love the feel of Glory to Rome. There's really nothing else quite like it. I got massacred by my wife through unlucky card draw. There is really nothing in the game to prevent bad luck or a catch-up mechanism for that matter. It is sometimes painfully obvious that you are going to lose, and it wasn't necessarily any thing you did wrong, just bad luck. Therefore, there's a high degree of randomness in GTR. Interestingly, it doesn't really bother me. I LOVE this game, and it will remain in my top 10.

RATING: 7
One if the best games for multi-use cards. The game can be very lopsided Once people build their structures, but that does help with the theme.

One downside is that it does take some time to play, so it is not something I want to break out every week, unlike Race for the Galaxy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.99
This game definitely needs two ratings. The initial rating for when you first play it and then when you get a better handle on the game. I say that San Juan has rails and a net as where Glory to Rome doesn't even have rails. This game doesn't swing, it avalanches.

Black box ed.

Rating Potential: First impression falls in at an 8 and that seems locked in. I liked it, but it's not a smooth first play so it doesn't go higher. I think 8.5-9 will likely be where it falls later on after more plays.

Update: New rating system and second play bumps it up. It still needs more plays but this so far is my favorite single purchase card game and really showed me how much I like games that offer multiple choices in each card. This will fall somewhere in the 8.99 to 9.99 range when it is said and done.

Update: 4 plays and we are down to 45 mins for a 3-player. I´m sticking to my 9 here.

Hm, hard to rate this one after two plays. My first game was approx 90 mins and the second game slightly longer. That seemed about right though there was some AP in one session. At 90 mins I´ll be happy to play this any time. If it runs longer, not so sure.

I really like the mechanisms here. Actually, I think they are brilliant. Some buildings I´m not so sure about. Coliseum can cause some hard feelings. Some buildings are always useful, like Senate, while others are more situational. Overall, I don´t think any cards are really broken, but time will tell.

I´m giving this a 9, for now. Next few sessions will tell if that should be an 8.

What I like:
- A good amount of player interaction with legionary and following with clientele.
- Building up your clientele to be more efficient at actions
- Large variety of building powers make each game different, and it's fun to think about how to combine those powers
- Low player downtime due to following roles

What I don't like:
- Sometimes you can get lucky drawing the perfect combo of crazy buildings, as well as luck in drawing the materials you need to finish those buildings
- It is incredibly hard to get a merchant into the clientele unless you have a special building power or if the person right before you uses the merchant card.

Bought on playbazar.it 8/3/16.  The shipping cost is ridiculous, but Mary prefers the Italian art.  It will also help us in learning Italian.

---

The game starts out slow, but quickly snowballs.  The combinations possible in this game often seem gamebreaking, which often times create seriously epic turns.  And yet, the game still feels balanced.  Great replayability due to the angst of multi-use cards.

The Italian version is turning out to be a bit more work than we thought.  I don't mind the Italian so much, but the Camp board is way too big.  The cards themselves are also fairly large.  Condensing all of these can really go a long way towards saving table space.

Definite runaway leader problem, which makes it hard to get people to play.

Just the one play so far, but that is enough to tell me that I want to play some more. I suspect that I'll prefer this to RftG because the iconography isn't as obscure and there aren't those super-clever combos that are a pain for the infrequent player of RftG. If I can get more plays of GtR then I can see RftG being Jones'd out.

I've now played a couple more times and this is definitely growing on me. It runs a little longer than you might think, because it can get a little 'thinky' because of the number of options available, but I think this will go down with familiarity. Have yet to play with the Imperium or Unofficial expansions. This one'smgoing to come out as a minimum of 7

Undecided. First game was fun but in the 2nd and 3rd game my GF achieved such ridiculous combos that it somehow quenched the fun. Not just for me on the losing end but also for her, because who wants to manage 20 clients or perform 12 building actions in one turn? Not us, it seems. That very swingy "any combo goes" mentality is not to our liking, we like shortages and difficult, streamlined decisions. Not sure if it hits the table again. I'll maybe go back a few steps and try the more down-to-earth San Juan and, if this is for us, maybe some time in the future, RollftG.

For this type of game, GtR is probably one of my favorites.  I don't know that I enjoy card games where there are so many types and it's impossible to know what your opponent may have.  In GtR, however, players don't immediately gain the effects of the cards so that aspect is mitigated.  If I were to spend some time really learning the game with repeated plays, I could see how my opinion of the game could go way up.  As it is, most of my plays have been with 2p and I don't know that 2p is the best. 

My wife enjoys this one quite a bit. 

Edit: Played this one with some real gamers (4p), and that's really when the game shines..

The components are very ugly (gaudy colors and so forth), but beneath all that is a gem.  This is a great game where you have role selection and different types of powers in various suits of buildings.  A lot is going on here and there is some minimal conflict too with the legions stealing stuff.  A very good game.

Again - this is another example of how it is important to not judge a book by its cover.  The game seems to have a surprising amount of depth despite its cartoon style cards.  It reminds me of San Juan on steroids.  Lots of stuff going on and it seems the various cards should keep this nice and fresh for quite a while.

RATING: 4
06/09/12 Played a four-player game. Take San Juan and add three more layers of rules over it and you have Glory to Rome. Which begs the question, why would anyone want to do that? Two words come to mind "overwrought" and "convoluted". All that tucking cards under the player mat irritated me (some on the left, some on the right, some above, and some below) reminded me of Innovation, a game I dislike, with its "splaying" cards left, right, up, or down. I hope to never see Glory to Rome again.

Excellent cardgame. I need to play this more often. Multiple use of cards, multiple roads to victory, building of various points engines possible, I like it a lot and need to play this more often. Reminder for myself next time: don't just build any building, but build buildings that actually have very powerful extra functions/abilities. That seems to make the difference.

Glory to Rome will probably become a favorite before long.  It share the same mechanic as my beloved Race for the Galaxy but it's a bit more brutal than Race.  The game tactics are also quite different.  I would go as far as to say that it's a bit more deep too.  More deep but probably much less tested since many people report broken combo.  

Broken combo!  Cool...  Make that happen and make them legal and we can now have a very chaotic and good game.

RATING: 8
Call me shallow, but I refused to even touch the game with its original artwork. Wouldn't eat Beluga caviar from a used handkerchief either, so yes, I'm picky. Fortunately with the new edition boom with several different artworks finally let me take a closer look, and unsurprisingly I like it. As a late arrival with heavy Race for the Galaxy background, I can't avoid measuring GtR to Rftg. 

I'm used to Race's tidiness, so the first thing I noticed is the messy way Rome handles both the gameflow and the tableau space. For the first few times it's quite a task to track what clients/resources you have, what bonuses your buildings provide, how could you produce goods to the pool, or whose turn is it anyway? I'd say it has a steeper learning curve than RftG, but after you got used to the system it's fine. Seemingly there are more strategy in the game than base Race, there are more colorful combos to discover. I wouldn't say Rome is deeper regarding strategic choices, more spread-out rather. A fine game, certainly worth a try to anyone who enjoyed San Juan or Race for the Galaxy.

RATING: 7
Having never really liked the simplicity of San Juan and having grown tired of Race for the Galaxy, Glory to Rome scratches the perfect itch for a complex, strategic card game.  I like how each of the cards serve multiple roles, but also maintain their value in every situation.  The cards with the most helpful building powers would also be worth the most if you vaulted them instead and would provide the most powerful actions and allies if used as such.  Plus, any actions you choose to take get dropped into the general pool for others to snag and use to their own advantage.  There's a constant struggle for how to best use the cards in your hand, which makes the gameplay meaningful, exciting, and enjoyable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Played once - seemed fun enough, though this type of card game is not my favourite genre so I won't be clamoring to play it again.

I like that multiple buildings can be under construction at the same time.  I don't have a sense of the balance of the game after one play - the winner of the game used the road to build several stone buildings, which seemed like a pretty good strategy.  Definitely lots of options to explore.

RATING: 8
I like the variety of buildings, and the tough choices you have to make about how to use your cards.  My wife had a hard time getting used to the flow of the game and the strategy, so she's not a huge fan.  We probably would play it more if she was better at it.

Terrific multi-user card game.  Among the best in class.  Let's call this Race for the Galaxy's unruly older brother.  If Race is a "Euro" than GtR is it's "Amerithrash" shadow twin.

This can be tough for new players, and teaching the game requires skill or else players who are willing to just dive in.  There is a lot to chew on here.  The game can be swingy and luck can play a large role from time to time, but overall smart play outweighs luck.  Crazy combos are part of the design.

I always have a great time playing this, and after many plays, I've raised my rating.

San Juan look-alike. Definitely deeper than San Juan, but not necessarily better -- the luck of the draw can be crippling (when you need one specific resource to complete a building but just can't get it - granted there are some mitigating actions you can take), and the insane variety of buildings means that you might just not draw that one that you need to complete your combo. However, there is a lot of thinking going on, definitely many different ways to go about winning,and overall much meatier feel to the game. It is overly complex to grok at first and takes a number of turns to really understand what is going on (which can be very frustrating for beginners). 
I find Race for the Galaxy to be a better implementation of the same overall concept.

It took me 3/4 of a game to understand its rhythm and how the various actions interact with each other.  What I found was a game with a large variety of strategies and tactical decisions throughout.  In many respects it's a race game and although one can build up to some really powerful combos the game may be over before you have a chance to convert the fruit of your labors to victory points.  This is why the game is compared to Race to the Galaxy.  

The cards are very cleverly designed in that they have multiple functions depending on how/where they are used: a building material, a power, VPs, influence points and an action selection power.  With a handful of these cards and more available within the deck and pool it can be very overwhelming at first but it all starts to click by the end of your first game and the variety of options should ensure that each game is a different experience.

Truly horrible artwork, although the underlying card-based mechanics are okay.  Basis is in role selection, while actions and abilities are activated and played by cards.  Cards are also the "buildings" and the building materials.  Lots of management of cards getting into hand, into stockpile, etc.  Okay playability--yes, there's strategery--but it lacks much of a real punch.  Did I mention the artwork was bad?  It's too colorful and busy... took away from the affordance of the game.

Best w/3-4, 2-5:

Also own the Black Box Edition

Imagine if Puerto Rico and Cosmic Encounter had a baby which they named it Glory to Rome.  GtR Cons:  Kind of a hodge podge of rules, it's difficult to teach, it usually takes the better part of your first game to get a handle on the rules and strategy, and so it's a gamer's game.  Pros:  Somehow it all works...you are actively engaged on every players turn, all of the cards are overpowered so it balances somewhat, it's got some back and forth (legionnaire), it's got engine building in a sense, you are racing to complete your buildings so there is tension, depending on what you build every game feels different (variable player powers).  My only regret is not being able to get this to the table more often.

Finally got to play this after waiting about 2 years.  I love it, probably like it better than Race for the Galaxy.

However, I played it first with a person who's probably played a dozen or more games of it, and so he'd memorized many of the cards and learned many possible combos.  So, I was taken aback at the game's quick end both times, as he played cards to end the game massively earlier than expected (but clearly within the rules).  

I'm not sure I like the early-end possibilities included in the game (especially since I'm not sure I want to have to memorize all possible combos to watch out for them), but I'm interested to see how it plays out.

If it weren't for the early-victory combos, this would be a 9; as it is, it's a 7.5 until I play it more.

Rating changed from 7.75 to 9.15, on 12/27/17.

This is a Chudyk game of delightful complexity. It isn't that hard, one might think, to have a hand of cards where each edge and then the center are all different resources/actions/capabilities... but it quickly becomes tough to budget for The Plan with so many card facets to manage, while also dealing with the turn-decision mechanic of Caesar changing to different players each turn.

The art is garbage, but it adds to the charm, honestly.

The rulebook for this game is incredible and should be an example to all other game publishers. There is an example for every card! 

Catacombs and Forums are the most important buildings. Forums let you win the game immediately (by having one client of each type) and Catacombs let you steal a victory through VPs by forcing the end of the game. I believe these two building types are the main focus of the
game as they give you control on when it will end IMMEDIATELY.

This game definitely deserves a replay and I usually don't like VP engine type games. I guess it's because this game actually has player interaction and variable end conditions!

I don't mind the original version's cartoony artwork, but have to say that the building foundation cards are extremely ugly. Also, the playmats are too small for their purpose. [11 plays]

This one seems more tight and balanced than Innovation, but like Chudyk's other design, it crescendos at the game end in an amusing and strategically interesting way. I see playing this more often than Innovation or Race for the Galaxy, just because it feels a little less abstract and a little bit more accessible (which is ironic, because I would argue it is actually more complex than either of those titles.) Looking forward to playing it some more.

Ender is right: [thread=371582]this is the game Race wanted to be[/thread]. The game plays differently each time and demands constant player interaction. Takes longer than quickies like Dominion, but you don't lose time shuffling cards.

After almost 40 plays, I have to admit this has gotten a little old. I still won't turn down a game, am glad to have it in my collection, and enjoy it when I play it, but I'm less inclined to suggest it. I also have almost no interest in teaching it, as the explanation takes [i]forever[/i], new players are invariably lost no matter how well it's taught, and I feel obliged to play the inferior Republic version. Thus, in specific circumstances, this is an 8, but most of the time it's a 6, so I've split the difference for my current rating.

While [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/63888/innovation]Innovation[/url] (by the same Author) is a fast-crazy card game, GtR is a complex, deep experience with many paths to victory that requires a lot of thinking and a constant eye on the cards' powers.

Nagyon örülök, hogy megjelent magyarul, mert egyébként biztosan nem szerzem be.
Van benne szerepválasztás, építkezés, és kellő interakció, minden amit imádok. A piac és a szerepek jó ötlet mind, a rajzok a magyar kiadásban pedig gyönyörűek!! Kártyajátékról lévén szó a húzásoknál lehet persze pechünk, de ebben a játékban ez egyáltalán nem zavaró.

The game that, for me, defined the multi-use card genre. I was lucky enough to nab one of the last remaining copies in Canada before this version of Glory To Rome became near impossible to find (without paying a fortune). That's a shame, because I wish more people had a chance to play this game. It starts out small, and by the end, you're performing huge, super powerful moves... the escalation is incredible.

In der kleinen Schachtel von Ruhm für Rom steckt eine ganze menge Spiel drin. Außerdem ist Ruhm für Rom kein Leichtgewicht, sondern bietet durchaus komplexe Regeln. Mittels Karten versuchen die Spieler die Stadt Rom wieder aufzubauen, die nach dem großen Feuer 64 n.Chr. stark verwüstet wurde. Die Karten können dabi auf unterschiedliche Arten genutzt werden, z.b. um Ressourcen zu bekommen, Gebäude zu bauen oder seine eigene Schatzkammer zu füllen. Man muss sich als Spieler immer entscheiden, wie man seine Karten am sinnvollsten nutzt. Der Einstieg in Ruhm für Rom ist nicht ganz einfach, danach entfaltet das Spiel aber sein volles Potential. Für Strategen und Planer absolut empfehlenswert!

Very clever game in the multiple use of cards genre.  It takes a bit to get going; but once you understand the roles--it rocks!  Would rank in order of ease of play: (1) San Juan, (2) Innovation, (3) Glory to Rome, (4) Race for the Galaxy.

I have no problems with the artwork of this game!  To be honest, after only a couple of plays I didn't really notice it anymore.

It's definitely not a bad game.  I agree with the people who say that this game is basically a competition to see who can 'break' the game first with the craziest card combo.

I thought that sounded like fun, but in reality it's not really for me.  Maybe I'm just vanilla, but I enjoy the relatively controlled/highly-balanced 'typical' Euro games.  If I want to play a card game that employs role selection, I'll choose Race for the Galaxy 10 times out of 10.

Got another chance to play with 4.  Once again, very good experience.  It's a longer, wilder and funner ride than San Juan.  I will still keep San Juan, because its' better to play for family and non-gamer friends.  Glory to Rome is definitely a gamer's card game.  Glad I chose to pick it up, and FINALLY get it to the table!!!

Why are there so many cards in the middle? Are we doing something wrong?

However I do find it extremely fiddly, slipping the cards in and out of the player board, it usually gets all jumbled up together.

I'm usually not fond card games where you do nothing but drawing, combining and playing cards. However, in Glory to Rome, there is more meat to the decisions. A card can be an action, a resource, a building, a client or a number of victory points so you need to decide carefully how to use each one. The actions you choose can be followed by the others so there is constant interaction and little downtime. As a negative point, knowledge of optimal combinations may still be more important than tactics and strategy but this still beats all other card game out there.

Almost sold this one because I had heard it was very similar to Race for the Galaxy, which I already own.  Sooooo happy I kept it.  Great game, and not at all hard to pick up once you figure out the rules.  I prefer RftG for 2-player games, and GtR for everything else.

In the same vein as San Juan and Race For The Galaxy, but much more of a brain burner and different enough to merit its inclusion in any collection.  It sets out its own agenda in the combined roles of the cards and the various different victory conditions, and the hidden points in the vault are a great touch.  Can lead to some crazy combos once the buildings are all lined up, like San Juan gone crazy.

A travesty. Oh, look, the cards, they have tons of uses, that's so elegant! But there's actually no functional difference with gaining resource cubes and meeples. The truth is probably that all the gameplay was crammed into cards because that would make the game cheaper to produce (and that's a smart decision for a newbie indie publisher). Actually a very classic resource trading cube-pusher euro disguised as a card game. With random exponential engine explosions.

While I like this more than San Juan, the learning curve is definately higher, even than Race for the Galaxy (And I didn't think that was possible).

The improved production values of the I.V edition wasn't enough to make a buyer out of me.

In this Roman themed card game, each card has three things it can represent: it can be a client (architect, crafstman, merchant, legionary, laborer, or patron), it can be a building material (rubble, wood, concrete, brick, stone or marble) or it can be a building. On a player's turn to be leader, they play a card out of their hand to do that client's ability (e.g., play an architect to start a building or get material for a building). Other players can follow suit to get the same ability, then the next player gets to be leader. Wild cards known as "jacks" allow one to follow suit if they do not have the card. 

Each player has a player mat, where cards are stored. Depending where the card is stored, it is a client (gives further actions if you or an opponent choose that action), or it is a building material in "stockpile" area, or it counts as VPs in the vault. 

This is a fun game, with many interesting card combinations. I want to play this at least 10 more times to get the feel of it. Most of the learning curve is in the first game, then you can start exploring strategies, such as having an early merchant to earn VPs in your vault, or other clients. This game has a lot of potential to be good.

I played a copy where the owner removed certain cards (ex: the ones that end the game automatically) so my game dragged on a bit. It was hard to wrap my head around initially but when I did, it was a neat little game. Unfortunately, I had a bad game start so I was definitely going to lose. I might give this a higher score with the full game (probably 0.5/1 points at most).

What might not be apparent at first is the sheer variety this game gives. for %90 of the game the cards do not function as their namesake buildings.

The game feels fun to play after you know how to play it. It's not too easily accessible as there is quite a bit happening. But once you learn how different roles work they are relatively intuitive. In the end rules are pretty straight forward. The cards are cleverly used to function in different ways. 

If you think there are powerful combos in games like San Juan or Race for the Galaxy then think again. Some combos in GtR feel absurdly powerful. Luckily most cards are as powerful (in some combo at least) so there is "balance". There is quite a bunch of player interaction. With some buildings (Colosseum) you can hit other players quite badly. Gameplay is a bit on the chaotic side but perhaps not too much as I actually liked Glory to Rome (to my surprise).

Wicked. "Cards with multiple uses" taken to the extreme, meaning tough decisions all the time. There are huge shifts in the balance of power on almost every round, and some cards may lead to absolutely ridiculous effects. Still, the game feels like you actually have enough control over your success, and manages to stay fun.

The graphics are much less repulsive than what you'd expect based on BGG pictures. They are actually quite decent, at least from a usability perspective.

Le tante opzioni lo rendono un gioco affascinante e profondo. Al contrario dell'apparenza, si presenta come un mazzo di carte, è un gioco complesso e le prime partite potrebbero sembrarne. Ottima interazione e tempi morti rari. Per alcuni aspetti ricorda Race for the Galaxy e anche il suo sucessore Innovation. Secondo me poco azzeccate le illustrazioni di carattere fumettistico.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.8
Where Race For The Galaxy failed to leave an impression, Glory To Rome hits. There's much more sense of control here, despite a somewhat chaotic spiral to the game speed, and more opportunity to get to grips with the cards, even if the colour-theming is somewhat restrictive and the card art is pretty woeful. One of those rare games that seems to excel with three players.

Further Thoughts: Sure, I understand it's all about clever combos and big ramping-up of the game speed. The problem is that, the more this happens, the less skilfully you're actually able to play the game. Downgraded from 8 to 7.

Further, Further Thoughts: Has faded somewhat with the release of the streamlined Mottainai. Not sure how many more plays this will get.

Glory to Rome feels to be a more complex, chaotic and longer version of San Juan.  While I appreciate the game mechanics and enjoyed the play to a degree I wasn't overly fussed with the theme or artwork of the cards. Building powers seem quite powerful. However, as someone who values theme in a game, I would rather be leading Roman legionaries to victory in battle than seeking Nero's favour by overseeing Roman labourers in building. Rating may increase with more plays and a better understanding of the interrelationships of all the cards (but I doubt it).

Just a really fun game.  Just about the perfect play time (40 mins), so if you're doing badly it will all be over soon. The more I play it, the more I like it.  Coming up with good card combos and countering other players.

With more players I think there needs to be more out of town sites, as most sites get turned over pretty quick, which can mean you're very limited in what you can do end game.  Some may see this as an extra layer of strategy.  My current thinking is not.

This is a gem of a game. Don't let the cartoony graphics fool you, there's quite some depth in this. Fans of San Juan, Race for the Galaxy, et al will like this. But its different enough to be worthy of its own place in a collection. The biggest difference being the way the cards that are used to select the roles, are usually made available for players to use again as resources the next turn. Recommended.

[i]Loved this game, which isn't really a surprise since I have loved every game where cards are used for multiple purposes (RFtG and La Granja). I could imagine playing this over and over again, constantly trying new strategies to win the game.

The only problem is finding a copy that doesn't cost an arm and a leg. I have decided to hold out and play Impulse before deciding to plop down the money to get a copy of GTR. (Unfortunately Impulse didn't cut it.)[/i]

Interesting game. A bit hard to wrap your head around in the first play through, but once it clicks it is a lot of fun. I enjoy the art of the black box edition, but it seems that sleeving is required if you don't want the black edges of the cards to chip. The new art is very functional during play and makes it very easy to see what's going on. I'm very excited to play this more. It also had the issues of some bubbling on the box and some of the black ink from the instruction manual came off on the lid so there is black on the white inner lid and white on the black instruction manual. Not a huge issue though, but maybe just because I had already heard about the issues before I bought.

I absolutely love the mechanics of this game.  The player interaction is really high, which can be a plus or a minus depending on the group.  There is a ton of decision making.  The only thing I don't like about this game is the power of some of the cards, and how some can create a negative play experience (like Catacombs).  I am currently removing some cards and adding extra copies of others, because my gaming group loves the mechanics of this game, but hates certain cards.

I like the art style of the black box edition. I'm really glad that I kickstarted it.

Glory to Rome is possibly my favorite of the games where cards can be used in multiple ways. Every game is a challenge to try to put together an engine and to maximize the potential of your cards. The player interaction feels great to me. There is more interaction than a game like Race but I feel like the player interaction has been well received in almost every game that I have played. 

I hear some negative comments about the promo cards, but I
Like playing with them to replace some cards that created negative play experiences. I don't play with all of them, but have enjoyed swapping some of them in.

To me, not being a card-game-minded player, finally I found a good card-game again. Although it's not that typical pure card-game-way played. 
It offers enough tension and possibilities. Card-luck still has an impact, but can be reduced partially with a Jack-of-all-trades.
The instant victory-card (Forum) isn't a fun thing at all when other players make this move. On the other hand, it offers a way out for those, who can't pick up with the opponents.

Nice to Play. High replay-value due to the various different buildings. When it comes to the end it can get a little bit chewy. And I think there are some too obvious and unbeatable winning strategies.

A clever game, which appears to have a wide range of viable strategies and lots of replayability. I really like the way that there seem to be so many possible strategies which is important, because ultimately this is a tactical game of doing the best with the cards you get, rather than starting out with a set strategy.

My #1 favorite game!

I love it for the fact that there's no set-ways of playing it. The combos those building's abilities can give are endless. Being creative both strategically tactically would likely to award you with more wins, that's the best thing I like about this game. Once I didn't play to win (cuz my friend had lost a few times straight so I tried to go easy,) I still had fun just building whatever buildings come in handy and hire whoever that's available. (On top of that, I still ended up winning..) 

Just build and hire first then think about what to do with them next! You might just come up with new ways of playing it. 

This game is like a bag of pleasant surprises for me.

Pros:
1. Deep in strategy.
2. No optimal/sure-win strategy.
3. High replay value.
4. Great player interaction.
5. Lots of different combos to be discovered.
6. Feel differently each time you play.
7. Helluva FUN!

Cons:
1. Below par art (I don't give a damn~)
2. Bad packaging (But who gives damn!)
3. Okay, it's not always THAT fun. Could be boring sometimes especially when one's getting an extremely poor card draw, or an extremely lucky card draw. BUT only sometimes!

Note:
GF also likes this game! Wuuhaaaa~~~

RATING: 6
Seems like San Juan only better since there are more strategies you can try. It can get very chaotic in the late game as everything spirals out of control until eventually the game terminates.

The game is brimming with 'overpowered' combos waiting to be found - anywhere else they'd break the game, but here it doesn't matter because everyone can make a 'broken' combo, so it sort of balances out...maybe... 

I've decided I prefer Race (20 mins) to Glory to Rome (c.60 mins) due to play time. Puerto Rico is preferable if you have 60 mins.

This is one of my stranded-on-an-island games !!

Excellent Fun Refreshing Variable-Phase Order Card-Management Game !! Wonderful feel to the strange gameplay. Humorous. Interesting card combo potentials. Very different in feel than other role selection card games, IMO. Thank you, Lee family for teaching us this game !!

I really enjoy the famous quotes on each card, and I don't mind the artwork and colorful graphics of the pre-Black Box editions. I think they add to the humor of the wild combos, and to the ensuing chaos. The impressive graphics of the Black Box might make the game a little dry for me.

This game deserves to be allowed for another publisher to reprint this game properly. To whom it may concern, please let "Glory to Rome" go so it can live.

Despite the gaudy cartoon art and the 'cheapass' packaging, this inspires me much more than 'RFTG'. Could be that I prefer 'Rome' themes much more than sci-fi. I love the mulitple and 'humorous' use of cards, which opens endless strategies, and it doesn't have the iconitis and absolute dryness that RFTG has. Much more player interaction than RFTG.

RATING: 9
The build of the game is... well, it's pretty piss poor. Some of the cards are misprinted, the stock on the "camp" mats is too flimsy and lightweight, the instructions are poorly written and confusing and the box can only be described as disposable. I enjoyed the game mechanic itself, but found that the design of the cards was too busy and distracting, all the more so when compared to this game's nearest neighbor, Race To The Galaxy, which seems to put more information on the cards with less text, nicer fonts, much easier-on-the-eyes art and more intuitive layout. It's a fine game when you get past all that, but the getting-past-all-that poses as much of a challenge as any opponent you'd face.

Overall, the game is badly in need of a buff-up and cosmetic redesign. So much so that, while playing, my mind wandered into thinking about doing it myself. Not bad at all, but clearly the work of guys who care more about the game they've come up with and much less about the medium itself. Considering how competitive the market is and how many incredibly rendered games came out this year, it's barely passable.

Similar to Race for the Galaxy. "Overbalanced" buildings and crazy combos of those buildings makes it more fun and play is more "open" than in RFTG. While i don't think design of the cards are done all that well, i actually like cartoony/funny feel to the game and bright colors are helpful in following the game.
IMHO this game should be at least in top 20 on BGG.

Based on one play: A card driven game that is fairly complicated to explain but flows quite well and is fairly short once everyone understands the mechanics. Using cards to perform actions and following what other players perform, you build, collect resources and transfer points to your vault. Great fun but maybe not always on your first few turns as you try to fit the flow of the game into a winning strategy.

RATING: 7
This card game has the San Juan/Race for the Galaxy thing going where someone chooses a role, and then you have to make the best use out of it.  That's where the comparison ends, though.  Cards in the game can be used as roles you initiate, permanent roles for when they are initiated, buildings that give you advantages and points, materials for those buildings, or even materials that just give you points.  There's a definite flow that's pretty difficult to wrap your head around the first couple of times playing, but once you figure it out, it's a good strategic game.

The artwork on the Black Box edition is unparalleled and the rulebook is complete and easy to use. We played three games in a single evening, too, with it being essentially the first game for two players.

I realized quite quickly why this is called a tactical card game...
Definitely one of those games I don't want to teach. Otherwise, the game includes very clever ideas as multi-useful cards and stuff, wouldn't have invented those by myself. Well, it felt somewhat luck-based in particular situations a bit too much. Many would disagree with me, but that's what it seemed to me.

First time I just threw the cards to the table, second time I understood why I threw them and perhaps next time I'll throw the correct ones there...

This was a pleasure to play with two, perhaps 1-2 more players, but five feels a bit much. I'd buy this otherwise, but not many can be converted to play this because of the complexity. Shame, I'd really like to get to know this one better.

The game itself is decent, but I will never play it again due to my experience with CGF.

I was disappointed with the quality of my Black Box copy. My box cover has many bubbles (I could live with the small bubbles on the top, but the long bubbles along the sides were huge and meant the box was likely to get wrecked fairly easily.) 

Some of the cards are shredding at the edges (after 1 play) so I'm not sure how well they will stand up to further plays. There are also dots of dirt or glue on some of them. (My husband actually asked if someone had bled on the cards... that is the color of the "dirt" or whatever it is.)

I sent a (polite!) email asking for a replacement in September 2012... company still hasn't responded (as of April 2013.) Even an apologetic "sorry we don't have any more copies" would have been better than six months of crickets.

I will not purchase anything from this company again. 

Edited to add: If I hadn't already decided that I would never send another dollar to CGF, the latest kickstarter update would have convinced me. Because hey, apparently it's okay to call your customers the "most unthankful, disrespectful, ironic, childish people on earth" if it's in a back-handed, passive aggressive way.

Played a learning game with simplified rules as recommended in the rulebook. Cards with different functions like in San Juan and Race for the Galaxy, but different enough to be interesting. I expect it to be a lot better with the full rules.

We played a few more times with the full rules, and it was even better that way as expected.

Played it while it was in the beta test stage. Based on other comments the published version doesn't seem to have changed in the areas I thought it was weak. Very fiddly, chaotic play, the rules are not clear. One of those games that when you are about 3 minutes into it you are confused but that is often the case when learning a game. 10 minutes later, still confused and lost, the game ends and I still never knew what I was doing.

Stick with San Juan.

Great game. Had lots of trouble distinguishing between Craft and Architect for some weird reason. Sewers is 100% overpowered - no question, no doubt - we simply remove it from play without negative effect to game balance.

By far my favorite game.  I have passed up other new games a really wanted to try when I was asked if I wanted to play this one.  the more I play the worse I become because I am always looking for the one strategy and just can't seem to find air as the there are some many options to choose.  Love this game.  Here's hoping for a reprint as I think I am going to need a back up copy.

After 14 played this game is starting to show some wear and tear. I tried to sleeve everything but it still is looking well played.  I have 14 plays so I am glad I have it.

What a crazy game.  It's all quite sensible to start off with but quite often one of the boxed springs boings out of the game and one of the players has just won?  It's nuts, but very enjoyable.

At first I wasn't a big fan of the clip art and garish gradient heavy artwork.  But after playing the game it actually suits the game really well.  I even think the new black box edition doesn't fit as some of the cards seem comical in their abilities and aren't suited to the serious theming.  Buy the original version that at first makes your eyes bleed!

I have enjoyed every time I've played this glorious game.

I love the combos and how the game speeds up exponentially. 
I really like the art on the French (originally Polish, also German) cards and also the Italian cards. 

It makes me angry that the publisher is so incompetent. Firstly, I can't believe that the game is out of print. I don't really like either the I.V (at least it's clear) or Black Box art. 

It's not too hard to teach to someone who wants to learn, which give it the edge over Netrunner. But the game rewards experience and creativity.

Not as fast as Race for the Galaxy with more than players but I think it's more fun. The game is very messy and takes up heaps of room.

Rating based on a first play without the building powers. I expect the game would completely change if they were included, since the Merchant action was dominant this way. I really like the role selection mechanic, although I often felt too limited in my choices based on what was in my hand. I wish drawing cards were a more dynamic part of the game (maybe a specific role for drawing cards, which you can specialize in like any of the other roles).

A fun game with a lot of things going on. More chaotic than Race for the Galaxy, but more player interaction. The building powers do shake up the game a lot, changing rules left and right. I like how the most expensive buildings are also some of the more useful actions. Using the merchant over and over seems to trump building powers, but I've only played two games. Sure the graphics take some getting used to, and it seems quite complicated at first, but if it's not as "elegant" as RftG, it's still a fun game.

Glory to Rome does a lot for a card game. Judging it by strictly card game standards, this is probably one of the best card games I've ever played. That being said, the cartoony art version is unplayable for me, and the black box edition, which I used to own, while I think the look of it is quite pretty, in a smooth bauhaus sort of way, the game just feels dull session to session. I thought it was me, so I sold this, and got [thing=128063][/thing]. That also didn't take off, so I tried [thing=175199][/thing]. That worked for us even less. Ultimately, I wound up back where I started. My love of Eminent Domain brought me to this game, and it is to Eminent Domain I have returned concerning this game. I'd be up for giving it another shot maybe if they did a wide release of a nice looking edition, but I'm ok for now.

In many ways, GtR reminds me of Puerto Rico with a hint of Go Fish, except it's a card game, and a focus on building rather than economy.

Still, an excellent game. I've only played twice thus far, and really mastering this game means understanding the proportions of different resource types/actions.

One thing I really, really like about this game is that the buildings are all super powerful. The buildings in Puerto Rico are good, but not typically game-changing. In Glory to Rome, almost every building has powerful effects.

Fun little game in the tradition of San Juan and Race for the Galaxy. I think this game beats both of them hands down.

Besides, why not support your fellow geeks, after all they created this gem. I rate this game high for the fun factor. The art is cutsy, but doesn't bother me. I love the quotes from famous Roman citizens on each card.

Very clever, well designed game, that is most importantly—fun!!  Plenty of important decisions to make that scratches a deep strategy game itch.  Cards have various uses- roles, resources, points, influence, and buildings (this can take some time to sort out).  The roles offer interesting combinations, as well as the ability to match a role that the leader has chosen or to “think.”  All players are engaged throughout the game.  Managing the “pool” is a fascinating aspect.  This one will begs to be played over and over.

Butt ugly production of an otherwise interesting game. The 'box' claims this is steeped in strategy but it seems too chaotic to make that claim. Yes you do have tactical and strategic choices but to say you have enough control to make for deeper strategy is reaching a bit too far.

This game cries out for DIY replacement components as the cheap component decisions make for overly fiddly mechanics that could with a little more production design consideration be made smoother making the overall game more enticing, faster to play, and a better experience.

The crazy combos are fun for a while but get old quickly and degenerate the game into a series of bad play experiences as you get better at creating them.  Also, the more I play, the less I like the Legionary role.  It can totally wreck your strategy  in ways that tend to make for bad play experiences.  Sadly, despite the glowing reviews, this game is no Race for the Galaxy.

RATING: 6
One 3-player learning game. A card game with little connection to the theme and cards that are a bit too thin for all the sliding about they have to do. The theme connection is usually unimportant to me for a Euro but I find the childlike artwork to be distracting from even the this thin relationship. Game plays much better than the rules read but there seems to be layered multiple uses for the cards that are just added in to make the whole thing a little more complicated. Lots of interesting buildings can be created (like San Juan but more so) and knowing them would certainly help with playing well. I think snatching a lot of cards from the pool into the Stockpile for future dumping into the Vault is the way to go as Vault points can be triple the points (or more with the bonus chips) used in constructing a building with the same resource cards. I'd play again (and maybe raise the rating) but it's not a game I'm planning on purchasing.

RATING: 8
A strategy packed card game. Each card has multiple uses and every turn requires trade off decisions. A geek game and requires 2 "training" games just to get a hang of the mechanics and to develop a preliminary strategy. 

The less said about game art, the better. For a game that has such a strong reputation and fan following among gamers who like strategy games, the game art is just atrocious and makes you feel like it is a children's game. But don't judge a game by its art. 

Finding partners who can understand how to play and then devise strategies to play it well isn't the easiest thing given its learning curve in that each card can play several roles - possible building, role, or material. Additionally, there is some luck involved in the cards drawn - sometimes, you just won't get powerful enough buildings or those that pair well with other buildings you have.

Very nice unusual card game.  Should play in about an hour once you have played a few times.

 A tableau building where the cards have multiple uses and will change uses depending on where you place them or if they are in your hand versus a common pool. Some similarity to Race for the Galaxy which I despise, but works here.
The game has more interaction than just follow the leader. Some roles allow for raiding of opponents, and the common pool has to be managed to assist you not your opponents. The roles you choose will depend on the clients your opponents have claimed.

The wild card is the buildings since each provide some sort of exception to the rules, and perhaps a sudden victory condition.

An utterly baffling engine-building game unlike anything else out there* where every combo seems broken. A clear precursor to Innovation, where that same "Every card is broken" idea became nearly perfect. Offers a ton of laughter and "you're going to hate me" moments, both of which were things that Race for the Galaxy always lacked (for me).

RATING: 8
I tend to think of Glory to Rome as a trick taking game  though no tricks are ever taken.  On a turn, a player plays and action card.  The other players can choose to also perform that action by following suit with a card of their own.

Actions allow a player to get resources, build buildings and "ship" resources for points.  The cards are multipurpose acting as actions, buildings, resources and points.  The thing that takes Glory to Rome and shoots it into the stratosphere relative to other games of its ilk is the variety and extreme nature of the special powers the buildings provide.

The building powers makes each game a wildly careening affair.  In isolation each card may appear completely broken.  When they are all combined the game blows up.  It's crazy and incredibly fun responding to the buildings players have built and the clients they have managed to acquire.  That's not to say the game is random or chaotic.  But you definitely want to hang on to your seats.  And if you lose your momentum in the game it's possible to be absolutely savaged by the other players.

This game is the answer to the accusations that efficiency engine games are multi-player solitaire.

Jan 2012: Down to 4. I don't particularly like "tableau building" card drafting/economic engine games.

2011-01-05: Tentative 7 after one play with only half the deck. I'm not a fan at all in non-collectible CCGs / VP engine games, so the rating for this game is likely to go down.

Pros

* In relation to Race for the Galaxy and San Juan, much more elegant ruleset. No bizarre icons and much easier to understand game structure than either RftG or SJ.

* It's a typical VP engine game as you build buildings that give you special powers, which makes you get VPs faster. Unlike VP engine games in which you don't have much of a chance to get to use the uber-powerful buildings, GtR allows you to build (and eventually use) any building you want right from the start of the game.

* The beginner game of removing half of the cards makes GtR a pretty good non-gamer game.

Cons

* Really, really, really fiddly, especially compared to RftG and SJ. Any game that involves tucking cards underneath other cards will lead to cards constantly being shifted out of place and out of sight.

An interesting game, which I scored as a 7 largely because I didn't enjoy it as much as some other games of a similar ilk - and most particularly Uchronia.

Fairly impressed with my first two games, even though I felt there was a bit too much luck/frustration with the draw of the cards, but my third game (three player) was painfully overlong. Easy too learn, and the 40+ individual building abilities means there's a lot to explore. However the game gets a bit chaotic and there's perhaps too many card powers for its own good. Oh yeah, the plastic container to hold the cards is awful. Cards keep slipping out! Would welcome the deluxe treatment. I'll always give it a go, but Race to the Galaxy is far superior.

A fun game that I've probably enjoyed most as a 2P game.

Played this version AFTER the Black Box edition. Minor (but strategically significant) differences in rules between the versions. The art is much more "busy" than the cleaner Black Box art, but I did not find it a distraction after the first few minutes of game play. The game is strong enough to overcome the generally poorer quality of the cards, the art, and the *packaging* (really bad) of this earlier edition.

RATING: 9.25
After the first two plays of the Black Box edition: The challenge with this game was where to start explaining it to new players. If you don't have a plan, you can easily lose people before you get to a point where you can start playing. Although the rules say not to, we just started playing. Made a couple of rules discoveries during the first game, but we all really liked it and we played it again right away. I'm ready to play again, anytime, and I want to teach it to the Friday night gamers, because I think they will really dig it.

Advantages of this edition over the I.V edition: FAR superior packaging (box, insert), higher quality cards (card art and card finish), player boards have more information, rules are a little cleaner. This newer Black Box edition also includes the Republic expansion, which was made available separately for the first and I.V editions. There is debate as to whether the card art, which is drastically different, is an improvement over the campier earlier editions. Personally, I think it is. It's clearer for game play, I would argue, and better matches the tone of the game than the earlier cartoony art.

One of the best games I've played that uses just cards.

Objectively, it's a good game, a great game even, it really is. That said, I hate the art. I can't stress enough how much the artistic style grates on my nerves. Yes, it is very functional I acknowledge that and I'm a function over form kinda guy, but come on... I hope to acquire a copy of the Black Box edition to rectify this.

I am beginning to like Carl Chudyk's designs. Keep in mind the objective of the game is to see who can break it first! Got trashed badly in my first game, and trashed my opponents badly in the next game. Always a pleasure to play one of Carl's designs. Black Box edition only makes Rome more beautiful.

RATING: 7
Glory to Rome has very direct interaction as opposed to the very indirect interaction of Race.  I think that the interaction is why Glory to Rome falls flat for me.  There is a lot of increased downtime while each player makes his/her decisions and plots and plans and figures out which cards to use.  There is some of this downtime in a large game of Race but because each player know at least some of the phases that will be selected, each player needs less time to plan while the other players sit around.  You cannot decide ahead of time in GTR what will happen because you have to wait for other players to figure out what they want to do.  This makes the game less interesting for me.

A bit of a learning curve to get going, but once you start to understand what things do and what you are trying to achieve, it moves along well.  A fun game with some humor blended in.  Many cards/combos are too powerful, but it balances out and is fine if you accept that going into the game.

I avoided this game forever because the art was such a huge turnoff. With the release of the Black Box I was finally convinced to give it a try and it was very good. Very well balanced and tight mechanics. satisfyingly heavy for such a simple deck of cards. The rulebook doesn't help much but once you get past that hurlde the game is actually pretty simple in execution, but tough to master. Every card has multiple effects, and it's easy to let the wrong card slip on accident. It takes some time to find your footing, but definitely rewards you for smart play.

Overall: I'd like to get my hands on a copy of the Black Box edition for myself, but until it is affordable I am happy just playing Uchronia.

Very enjoyable, if perhaps a bit chaotic. A card game of the same ilk as San Juan and Race for the Galaxy. Currently I like it better than RftG, simply because it's more approachable: no confusing iconography.

RATING: 9
Rating of 9 after first play.  I had always heard GtR was a good game for those that liked RftG - I would agree.  They use somewhat similar mechanics.

I liked the pace of the game.  It seemed quick but allowed lots of decisions at the same time (like RftG).  The art work is not my cup of tea, but it was better than I was led to believe.  Still, the bright colors make it easy to distinguish card types at a glance (although... Pastel? Ah well.) no need to keep beating that dead horse I suppose.

The buildings (those I saw in my first game) all seemed useful.  At first I saw a few and thought, "wow, that building is really powerful!".  Over the course of the game I noted I thought that about almost all of them, however... So they seemed balanced to me at first glance.

I also liked that the designers tried to tie the abilities of the building to the name of the building.  Theme is big with me, and I appreciated the effort in making the abilities "match up" with the name.  (I laughed out loud at latrine - juvenile yes, but still funny and clever)

Great game!

Smart, dynamic game. Not as difficult to understand the different card functions as I had feared, but I've only scratched the surface of how to manage them.

June '09: Played it for the first time at Tom's house with Tim and Allen.  Cool game.  Feels a bit like San Juan to me.  Took a while to get the feel of it.  I'd love to play it again sometime.

Edit Aug '09: Moved rating up to a "9" b/c I absolutely love this game.  Have played most of my games with Tim, but also some 3 and 4 person games with Tim, Allen, Nate, and Pearson.  Terrific interaction and the 2-person games just fly by.  Tim and I can play 6-8 games without even thinking about the time.  Played til 3 or 4am last couple of times.

Edit Feb. '10: Moved rating up to a 9.5 and {drumroll please........} into the #1 spot in my Top 10, beating out long standing Agricola.

Each card has several functions badly layed out, the use of them is counter-intuitive, the game suffers from certain escalation effects often beyond an individuals controlthat can be easily triggered by a poor player and the art is terrible. 

Having said that Glory to Rome is actually quite a good game. You move cards from central areas to hands to buildings to score points. These points feed-back into your play to increase what you can do. The central mechanic is that when a player takes an action every one else can follow that action, often taking the same action as the active player several times. Which provides an interesting set of challenges.

On the other hand it does feel like a game that really needs its second edition to really find its balance.

I got this game way back in 2011 as a Christmas present (the first Christmas after my wife and I got into modern boardgames). At that time I preferred games with simple rules (although I did love card games, and I knew this one was highly regarded), and I struggled with this at first - and, while I persevered, it soon became clear that most of my main game group didn't care for the game. However, I have managed to play it quite frequently since 2013 or 2014 (with a slightly different, although overlapping, group - helped by its relatively quick play time and the fact that the much-derided clamshell packaging does at least make it easy to transport along with other games), and my opinion of the game has gone up. There is a lot to think about in terms of how to use each card in your hand (as a role to lead or follow with, as a building, or as a building material for the craftsman action), and you need to think about what you put into the pool and how to best organise your leading, following and thinking in order to get the most out of everyone's actions. And that's before we even get to the real heart of the game - getting combinations of buildings which allow you to perform insanely effective chains of actions on a turn. Like many games, this one starts slowly and ramps up, but I've not played any other game where the final result of this ramping up can be quite so insane.

Perhaps this would be higher than an 8 if I played it more often, especially with players who all knew the game well. For now I don't feel I can rate it higher - and, while it's very interesting, it's not my favourite card game, I prefer both Dominion and Race for the Galaxy, which also offer great depth but have even more variety and  much simpler rules, and play quicker as well. (It's probably not even my favourite Carl Chudyk game - I usually prefer Innovation to this, although that to me is a 2p game while GtR is much much better with 3+)

Fabulous game.  Steep learning curve so play the 'training game' a couple of times first. The full game is fantastic... great fun, great theme and (as it says on the box) 'extreme strategy'.  Highly recommended.  Don't be put off by the components... the artwork is less 'cartoony' than first impressions might suggest.

RATING: 8
Ok, this may be cult of the new on my part, but this game appears to hit all my hot buttons. It's short, but not too short (abt 1hr). It's got very little setup time and it's very portable. It scales wonderfully from 2-5 players without losing strategic depth with fewer players or excess player downtime with more players. Just the right mixture of luck:strategy for me. There's some randomness to add excitement and (healthy) bit of luck, but strategy will always trump luck in this game. The strategic depth is awesome...many many many paths to victory and every game feels different. I love economic engine games and this one hits it out of the park without feeling overly repetitive (I'm looking at you powergrid). Unlike RfTG or San Juan, the interaction between players is much much higher...there's more going on between players here than just trying to guess what role they will take and mooching off it/screwing the guy to your left. Because the cards you discard go into the community pot, you have to be very careful and observant of what's being thrown away. No so-called "multi-player solitaire" going on in this game, no no. I love card games where cards serve multiple purposes because it inherently means tough decisions...do I play this card for the role it brings? Do i use it as the building material it is?

The box it comes in is a joke, and some will complain about the artwork...I actually like the artwork so no complaints on components.

LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!

EDIT - this has dropped 2 points since I last edited this. Who's to blame? Ohhh this evil little card game called "7 Wonders", that's who. It shows the flaws of GtR bright and clear. GtR is still an awesome game, but a little chaotic IMHO now that I've played it more extensively and the game has a tendency to *not end* sometimes. The passing of your discards into a common pool makes the interaction interesting in GtR, but this is put on steroids with 7 Wonders where you pass you entire unplayed hand to your neighbor.

Initial game was spent with folks getting their head around the interactions in the game.  Of course, we dove straight into the deep end with the building powers, but see no reason why experienced gamers won't.  Games does take a lot of space to play and is distractingly colourful as a result.  In other words, don't mind the artwork, but it is hard to see what's up across the table.  Sloppy players will have a hard time as it is key to keep the cards properly masked (ie are you using the top, bottom, left, right or middle of the card?)  

Don't know if it is typical or not, but only 5 points separated first from fifth in our first game, but no one felt the game was that close as we played.  Knowing that a few decisions might be key - wonder if we improve on our play as a result in our next game.

Commenters are correct that this is a much more strategic and sophisticated version of "San Juan" or "Race for the Galaxy."  I am glad to own it.

What I like so much about SJ and RftG are that they are so portable and play so efficiently.

RATING: 8
22-01-2014. Rated after 2 2p games. Very interesting card-game. Each card has many different functions. Each card can be used as a role —that gives you a special action—, a building —that gives you special abilities—, victory points —when stored in the vault— and lastly as a resource. Cards can be added to your vault, patrons, influence and storage.

When you take actions with your role card, you're allowed to take cards from the pool as many times as you have the role card in your patron pool.. 

This is a beautiful card game. It's complex, you have so many degrees of freedom and options to think. Fantastic. One of my favorite card games.

----------

I LOVE this unique gem of a game.  I love the player interaction, the role selection, the role leaching, the rewards from completed buildings, and the multiple paths to victory, the insane benefits of strong synergies.  Synergy, ah yes, the name of the game.  A name that makes this card game so addictive.

BELIEVE THE HYPE.  This is a great game, and I whole-heartedly recommend it.  Luck is mitigated since there are multiple copies of each card, so unlike RftG, you don't feel like you are hopelessly mining the deck for "that ONE card" to pull your strategy together.  

Here's a little secret of mine that tends to work well:  if you find a highly rated game with sub-par components... GET IT.  Good components tend to have a strong influence on game ratings .... but you know you have a winner when the game is butt ugly, but people still rave about it because the mechanics shine through.  GtR is that type of game.  

A caveat for the potential buyers:  I thought this game was going to be deeper than it is.  There are some good decisions to be made, but similar games, such as RftG and Innovation, provide much deeper gaming experiences.  

This is my #6 game.

(El)rettentően komplex játék, viszonylag nagy helyigénnyel bír (már ami a pakliépítést illeti). Analízis-paralizisben szenvedőkkel még véletlenül sem ajánlott leülni mellé.
Eléggé megfeküdte a gyomrunkat, de még biztosan többször is nekiugrunk, ha nem leszünk fejben fáradtak, mert igencsak agyégető kategóriájú, amolyan San Juan PRO jellegű.

Könnyítésként játszható úgy, hogy a megépített épületek tulajdonságait nem veszi figyelembe az ember.

up: Beérett :D
Revideálom az álláspontomat, annyira nem agyzsibbasztó, mint az első játék után gondoltam. Amint "magáévá teszi" a mechanikát valaki félelmetes mélységek nyílnak meg előtte.

Továbbra is csak azt tudom mondani: San Juan PRO. Kizárólag gémereknek. Nagyon érdekes, ahogy egy-egy nagy nehezen megépített épület milyen villám sebességgel rendezi át a sorokat.

First impressions: Comparing this to Innovation, which resembles GtR mechanically but plays very differently, I think there's more control in GtR. I feel like whatever cards you get in your hand in GtR there's always something you can do with them, at least using them for Craftsman materials. But in Innovation if the abilities the cards in your hand could grant you won't help and your tableu doesn't have anything useful for that turn, the only thing left is to draw a card.

Incredibly difficult to explain to new players, but one of the most rewarding card games around once everyone gets their head around it. With a group of newcomers it can take 1-2 hours, but once everyone really grasps how to play (which takes 2-3 plays) it can be done in half an hour. 

Kind of a modern classic and with good reason. The multi-purpose cards, the unique action-following mechanism and variety of scoring paths available make it a fun and highly replayable game. Just give it a couple of tries before you write it off as incomprehensible...

So far so good. I will probably never need to play San Juan again. This seems like the kind of game I could play 100 times easily, and still discover new depths. It also is a good argument for chaos in a design. You can have crazy card effects and minor insanity without throwing the strategy out the window. It's a great mix of dense strategy and unexpected results. But then I would expect nothing less from Carl Chudyk.

This game is a little difficult to learn with all of the moving pieces, and the included diagrams are little help. Once this game clicks with you it is fun.

It seems to usually end up with one person finding a runaway strategy and leaving all others players way behind.

I'll admit that I've only played one game, but there was just too much going on for me.  I'm not a fan of having to keep track of dozens of cards on the table for monstrous combos or playing many games just to "get it."  This one wasn't for me.

RATING: 9
I'm a fan of tactical card games, and Glory To Rome is one of my A-List. Set beside RftG, it's the second half of the dyad of brilliant card games which I'll gladly play again and again and are the reason I mildly prefer card games to board games. 

The art-work is inescapable when discussing this game but my view tends to be: the art's cartoony, so what? I don't really care - any art-work is fine by me, and if you don't like it, just ignore it, and the game is fine.

RATING: 7
Visual Appeal: (1)
Man oh man, I know everyone says it but the original printing of this game is just plain bad. The box is not attractive or even useful since it pops open without a rubber band. The only thing the cards have going for them over the new Black Box edition (That I stupidly didn't shell out for on Kickstarter) is that they are very legible.

Components: (2)
Not the best quality cards, and I highly recommend sleeving. Although this creates a massive draw pile, it is worth it to preserve the cards. As I mentioned above, the cards are very easy to read due to contrast/color even with the large amount of information they convey. The play mats are a good idea but way too small. If the game had a proper box, maybe they could have made larger mats too. I have a side project planned to create my own new mats/box for this game.

Theme: (3)
There's a back story to the game. I think it's something about rebuilding Rome after a massive fire...anyway it doesn't matter. The game is about card flow and hand management. There are some cool times where the theme peeks through and that is to the great credit of the designer Carl Chudyk. I feel like he did a better job here than in "Innovation". For example, the Vomitorium allows you to "vomit" cards into the pool. I am impressed that he was able to attach so many game actions to the historical function of the buildings.

Learning: (4)
This game is really easy to learn and hard to master. More than any card game in my collection (except maybe Race for the Galaxy) I think you must learn to read your opponents and play the strategies that present themselves. It is really easy to get stuck in a position as a new player where you want to do one thing, but the resources just aren't there to do it. I make sure that part of my introduction of the game is a reminder not to force something that isn't going to work right away. Due to the high number of duplicate cards though, long term strategies are possible to execute.

Gameplay: (5)
This is another game with a lot of screw you. There are plenty of opportunities to take resources that your opponents need and laugh maniacally as they are unable to finish structures or follow your actions. I like it a lot. 

Overall Fun: (5)
What this game lacks in appearance, it makes up for in interesting game play. Just the right amount of tension and interaction. The only one card that I don't like is the Forum. It can end games shockingly fast if it goes unchecked and it feels really unsatisfying. I want to use the Forum Romanum from the expansion when I get my hands on it. I usually play 2 player and even my friends who enjoy heavier games usually will play 1 or 2 rounds of this with me happily. This is my second favorite card game. after "Innovation."

It's basically a race through the deck to build structures and hoard resources. The twist is that the cards can be used either as actions, structures or resources. The structures give you abilities which work to give the game variety. Very busy cards and goofy art.

This game is amazing!
It does what San Juan or Race for the Galaxy hopes to do but really makes it interactive and challenging.  I got to get a copy of this game.

RATING: 9
2013: Definitely my favorite non-collectible card game. As all card games, it's much more tactical than strategical and involves building a good combo before anyone else. Still, when you decide on playing some key cards, you basically define your strategy for the game. It offers much more interaction - both direct and indirect - than Race for the Galaxy and is [b]much[/b] more controllable than Innovation. The only flaw (again, quite typical to card games) is that it's not as accessible as I would like. There's text on all the cards and on the first and second play you'll need time to read and digest it to make informed decisions, leading to slow play with new players.

2016: Upping this to a 9 but I should really finally give it a tenner and get over it - I can't see ever deciding I don't want to play it anymore. With dozens of plays behind, I really appreciate how subtle and not at all chaotic it becomes with experience. It's fun how it forces you to adapt and depart from favourite strategies and becomes about intuitive assessment on whose combo will win the race and whether you should continue racing ot switch over and start pulling the game in another direction. I think that it belongs on any shortlist of greatest timeless classics.

Getting this knockd my interest in Wallace's London out - it is possible that there are only so many tableau-building card games one should own, and this is definitely one of them. It is the most interactive of any I've played so far (with the possible exception of 7 Wonders, although I think it may just about beat that on this score too). And it is simply fun to play.

Also, I like the cartoons, the plastic box (which is compact and durable), and the lurid game colours ASSIST PLAY. Layout is clever, and the 'broken' strategies also add to the enjoyment of this entertaining game. 

I probably prefer Race for the Galaxy with 2, but this is the better for more players.

Recently increased my rating. With further play this has not only held up well, but allowed focus to be switched from grappling with rules to grappling with devilish plans and tricky moves. I'm even enjoying it with a full compliment of five. May its visits to the table be frequent and fun.

I think three might be the right number with this game - any more and there's a little too information to keep track of. Kind of odd card game where despite initial appearance that there's a lot going on it turns out there isn't much going on at all. Limited opportunity to discard and the weak theme causes me to feel a little let down, but all in all it IS a good game. The game is really quite simple and I was a little disappointed to see that there's really only two main ways of scoring points. Most building effort seems to be around buildings that allow you to either increase the size of your vault or improve the ease of placing material inside your vault. It's not terrible, but it doesn't seem like I have the control that I have in San Juan or Race for the Galaxy. Each of these three games have different mechanic for selecting a role on your turn, and the one used in Glory to Rome is a good one, but the other parts of the game just seem to miss that certain spark. I find the cards to be a little similar in the direction their effects push me and it frustrates me that I can't discard cards from the hand to the same degree that I can in San Juan or Race to the Galaxy. Often you'll find yourself being pushed in a direction you have no interest in going due to the cards in the pool and the cards in your hand. I think that's what creates my odd feeling about the game. So, it's good and worth multiple plays, but I thought it could be a little more. Rules do that annoying thing where they split essential information on the one mechanic into different sections, plus there's a few points still confusing that could have been elaborated on - out of town sites...

Just picked this up, looks to be everything I'm looking for in a card game. Direct and indirect player interaction, multiple avenues of victory, lots of things to consider and manage, cheap, and portable.  We have only played this a few times but I love what I see.  My wife is ify about it, it can be hard to wrap your head around all the things the cards can represent.  I hope she doesn't give up on it, I'm starting to see some of the endless possibility's with card combos and position placement.  This could be exactly the game I wanted Race for the Galaxy and San Juan to have been.  Oh, and the cartoon art work grows on you, I wasn't sure of it at first, now I really appreciate how well it works without the use of all those icons!

UPDATE: After some more plays, I'm loving this, rating up to a 9.

UPDATE: Just picked up the Black Box edition, although the price was right on Amazon, the box has bubbling, the Jacks have rough edges, the rule book was boxed with wet ink which transferred to the box top making the rule book cover look terrible, and the camp mats are dented a scratched. WORST LOOKING NEW PURCHASE EVER!!! The game looks USED. Lucky for me, I purchased the game to play and the cards are in descent shape, buyer beware. The kick starter contributors have every right to be pissed if they waited and received this, the quality control here is severely lacking! However, that being said, this is still one of my FAVORITE games!  Sad to FINALY get a "grown up" version of the game and it looks like crap.

Juego con mucha tensión que escala perfectamente a cualquier número de jugadores. La idea de que puedas ejecutar acciones de tus clientes, tanto en tu turno como en el turno de los demás, hace que no puedas despistarte un segundo y consigue eliminar el tiempo de espera entre turnos.
El juego varía considerablemente si se utilizan los poderes de los edificios, volviéndose menos previsible y caótico, aunque quizá un pelín más divertido.
Las únicas pegas, la mesa que ocupa y que la explicación de las reglas aunque es sencilla, despista un poco la primera vez, puesto que las cartas pueden jugarse de varias maneras distintas.
De todos modos es un gran juego, con bastante toma de decisiones y mucha tensión. Además la edición de Homoludicus me parece muy chula. Totalmente recomendable.

My first impression of this game was Steve Jackson runoff. Some crazy cards, it's an unbalanced game. A few stupid "end the game early" cards I don't like. However after I got to playing I started to enjoy myself. I like how the cards have many uses, but I dislike the luck involved in the blind draw. But yet is enough strategy behind the remaining decision to keep it interesting. I'm a bit conflicted. The game is best played on a big felt table.

If you're doing something only kind of broken, try to hold out for something really broken. Oddly balanced in the ways that different things are broken. 

Has a good amount of strategy, and plays somewhat like a combolicious, high player interaction cousin of Race for the Galaxy. You really need to pay attention to what other players are doing. 

Overall Glory to Rome is well designed, but I just don't enjoy the game as much as other tableau builders in practice.

I love this game.  It's has a mechanic like San Juan and Race for the Galaxy where the cards have multiple uses so you need to figure out what's more important, role vs resource vs building.  It's a little tough the first time or two but it grows on you.  One of my top 10.

Each card can be used to lead an action or follow an action, be built for its text effect, or to be used as material for another building. It can represent bonus actions when placed as a client, be used as building material in your stockpile, score VPs and increase client and vault limits when built, score end-game VPs when in your vault, and be available for recycling after being played as actions into the pool. Not to mention  you need to time when you can think - draw cards - and make sure your hand is small when it can afford to be and big when you need to respond and go on the offensive, and when to sneak in a jack.

There are so many possibilities, that in this game, and unlike in other card games that aspire to be, like Dominion and Race for the Galaxy (where you know which 6-dev you're aiming for, and what it says on there), strategies grow organically. There is no set strategy to pursue, and you truly have to devise new uses and combos for the modular pieces in your hand at every given time. This is far and away the best of its genre.

I've owned this game for a really long time but have had trouble getting others to play it with me.  I was happy to finally get that done.  It really was all that I hoped it would be.  I like the multiple uses for each card.  I like how cards move through your hand in a manner different than most games (or at least it feels that way to me).  Our game seemed to end rather abruptly, but I think that was more a result of one player having things come out in a particularly advantageous order.  I look forward to playing again and expect to enjoy it even more.  

As an aside, the art doesn't really bother me.  Honestly, I'm kind of surprised at some of the comments directed towards the art.  Oh well, to each his own.  [01/08/2011]

GtR is a really cool, goofy game that uses cards in innovative ways.

Each card played on a player's turn selects an action, and all other players may also take this action if they play a matching card, following the lead player. This is similar, perhaps, to role selection in such games as Puerto Rico, San Juan, RftG, etc.

The actions allow players to acquire cards as 'goods' onto their player mats, which can then be sold for victory points or used to construct building that grant players special advantages and powers.

It is indeed these buildings which add excitement, variety, chaos and uncertainty into the smooth flow of the game and give GtR its somewhat dubious reputation for being unbalanced or 'broken'. I appreciate the wackiness of these special powers and feel they lend flavour and texture to this card game banquet.

The way the actions lead to winning is somewhat circuitous, so I would recommend playing (as the rule pamphlet suggests) a starter game, without the special building powers, when introducing this game to new players.

This game has entertained and intrigued my partner and me thoroughly over a few dozen plays (2 player); I strongly recommend it!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Just one game, don't have a clue. Don't know what cards are in the deck, need to play some more. 

It's a San Juan/RFTG style game. Or so they say. I actually found the feel quite unique and the flow of the game intriguing - how the cards flow from your hand to discard pile to various places of player boards. It is optimisation thingy engine and doesn't have the card synergy of RFTG or the engine flow of Fleet, but has some amusing quirks on its own. Can only properly evaluate if I play it some more. I think some paths of the game weren't even explored that one time we played. 

The most interesting feature is the general flow of the cards, really weird and unique in particular how most cards have to get from your hand to the pile in order to be used again. Very intriguing. 

On graphic design: black box thingy. I'm not sure. On one hand it's pretty and clean - it's very clear which cards are where and makes it easier to follow the flow of the game. And it is evocative, but not of building Rome. The level of stylisations differs to much - some pictures are stylised (and those I like) but most are icons and while they're easy to read, they don't give you a picture of the place you're building. 
EDIT: went to check other artwork. Blah. This one is clean and easy to see what's going on.

Beneath the subdued graphics of the elusive Black Box edition lies a madcap card game of seemingly imbalanced abilities. Coupled with a tight network of actions, this seems like a recipe for disaster. But Glory to Rome somehow manages to pull it off, and with panache to boot. 

While players' personal strategies gradually solidify as building effects trigger, they have to continuously adapt to the changing game conditions as well. The cards you draw may suggest one option, but buildings in play could hint at another option. Players who keep track of the game's elements will statistically do better, although you do have the occasional outrageous combo that scoops the game – it's just how the game rolls.

Theme-wise, GtR is rather abstract and a difficult game to teach due to the confusing roundabout flow of actions. The fact that a player can be a runaway winner/loser is also a daunting prospect. 2P games suffer from a weakened Legionary action, while 5P games drag a little due to the sheer amount of information on board.

(rated the original printing of the game)

Convoluted and dense card game (though mechanics are actually fairly simple once you get the hang of the phases and multiuse cards) that gives players the illusion of control. Shades of San Juan, Race for the Galaxy and card games of similar ilk abound.

The game ultimately drags on for a little too long with little payoff. The Merchant action seems a little overpowered and there are so many special cards that the rulebook has detailed explanations of them (not what you'd class as an elegant game design)

The art looks like cheap clipart and the card design is overly bright and somewhat...ugly. But the game works as it stands if that's any consolation.

The game uses a great card mechanic (each card can be used for 1 of 3 things, but you must choose wisely) This is a great game. It's chaotic and even when you think you're out you're back in with the win.

Takes San Juan to another level of strategy and chaos, with more interaction between players (although you shouldn't expect a brawl).  A fairly steep learning curve, but still intuitive.  Randomness and some powerful cards may put some off.

RATING: 6
The game concept is very good. Quality and packaging are nice and slim and sturdy. I like all that.
Gameplay has much interaction, lots of humour, strategy (long-term planning), tactics (getting the stuff you need at the time you need it). All very good.
But it is quite chaotic at times (dont play when tired, not even a bit) and the "market" (open cards that one can choose from) can get quite messy.
The game has a steep learning curve, as there are many cards with special functions that need to be taken into consideration.
Rating might go up or down with more experience.

RATING: 8
I've heard a lot of good things about this game, including favorable comparisons to Race for the Galaxy, and my Corr8 GBs give it an amazing 9.00.

I hate to say it, but I wish the art/graphic design was better (or at least less cartoony).

Edit: the black box KS version looks gorgeous.

Update: played my BB edition once with 3p. I liked it quite a bit, but one player wasn't grokking it and we just rushed to the end to get it over with. In light of that I traded it away for another high-demand game.

Update: got and played Mottainai. Granted that I've only played GtR once, I feel like Mottainai delivers much the same gameplay and feel in less time with fewer components, and obviously for much cheaper.

Nagyon vártam a magyar kiadását a játéknak, már régebben felfigyeltem rá milyen előkelő pontszámmal áll a BGG-n kártyajátékként. Hallottam, hogy a San Juanhoz, RFTG-hez hasonló, így nagyon kíváncsi voltam rá. Sajnos másokkal ellentétben én nem tudok ódákat zengeni róla. Meglepő módon a játék nekem még nehezebbnek is tűnt elsőre, mint a sokak által csak kínai jelkombinációnak tűnő ikonrendszerrel ellátott Race for the Galaxy. A Dicsőség Rómának játékban ugyanis egy lap jóval többfajta szerepet tölthet be, mint sci-fi rokonánál. Itt is szerepet választ a körön levő játékos, amit a többiek vagy követnek egy ugyanolyan lap kijátszásával a kezükből vagy elmélkedést választják, amivel tulajdonképpen laphoz jutnak. Egy lap lehet tehát szerep, lehet ügyfél, lehet nyersanyag, lehet kincs, illetve épületként is funkcionálhat. Ezek talán még nem túl komoly játékosnak is pár játék után átláthatóak lennének, de az egyes épületek számos különleges képességeinek és ezek kombinációjának, kivételeinek megtanulása jópár játékot igényel és úgy gondolom sok játék után is azt észben tartani, hogy ellenfeleink milyen különböző épülettel rendelkeznek komoly feladat még tapasztalt játékosok számára is. Nem tetszett, hogy a többfajta játék vége feltétel közül kettő is egy adott lap kijátszása, sőt ezek közül az egyik a játék végén kívül az adott játékos győzelmét is jelenti. A másik lap pedig tökéletesen alkalmas arra, hogy az adott játékos akkor fejezze be a játékot, amikor ő áll nyerésre, ami lehet akár a második kör is. Úgy érzem vannak túl erős és túl gyenge lapok is az épületek között, nem túl kiegyensúlyozottak így a szerencse szerepe az által, hogy kihez kerülnek a jobbak jelen van a játékban. Megmondom őszintén nekem a tanulóváltozat (ahol az épületek tulajdonságai nem számítanak) jobban tetszett, mint a teljes. Talán ha kevesebb különbözőfajta épület lenne jobban tetszene. A 2005-ös játékot rengeteg kritika érte az eredeti kiadás csúnya volta miatt, nos a magyar kiadás nagyon szép kivitelű, de talán a nyersanyagok hangsúlyosabb kinézetet kaphattak volna, illetve a fordítás sem lett tökéletes, de ettől eltekintve korrekten néz ki a játék. Nem rossz játék a Glory to Rome, de ha 7 Wonders egyszerű kártyajáték csak gémerkategóriában kapott jelölést az Év játéka díjra Németországban, akkor a Dicsőség Rómát nem is tudom hova kellene jelölni, mert jóval bonyolultabb. Persze ez ne riasszon el senkit, mert sok játék után biztosan pörgősebb, de új embereknek megtanítani nem könnyű feladat. Aki kedveli a San Juan, RFTG párost, az mindenképp adjon neki esélyt, ha teheti, de mindenképp egy komoly játékra számítson. A pontszámom nem végleges, az első játékélmény nem volt túl pozitív számomra, ezért kap még majd lehetőséget.

[2014-08-23]
Kapott második lehetőséget is, de abszolút nem változott a véleményem a játékról. Nem rossz, de kicsit túl van szerintem bonyolítva feleslegesen.

Very solid system.  Many different paths to take.  Much like many of these kinds of card games what you draw will determine much of what "strategy" you will take, but I feel that the number of choices were plentiful.  

For some reason, I found the free actions initially difficult to absorb, but once you get the game you pick it up quick.  

The art is awful, but there was so many images necessary to making this that I mostly forgive it.  While this certainly has the same kind of thing going as the other Puerto Rico style card games have, there is a lot more going on here that isn't in the other games.  

All and all a winner.

While I was more than a bit confused during my first play of the game by the second game it all just flowed. A very nice alternative to the RftG craze that is actually more engaging and tension filled. While this needs a 2nd edition with revamped artwork...badly, the core of this game is super solid and smart. Three players hit the sweet spot.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Really fun game if you like cards that each do many things. There is a lot going on, but it all fits together well after a few plays. 

My only complaint is that some of the powers the buildings bestow are hella powerful. Now, many of them are like that, especially in combination with other cards, so any player has the same chance of getting them, but this does cause the game to be somewhat swingy at times. As a good example of this, in a five player game once we all actually surrendered to a player who had a crazy powerful combo going on - we stopped the game and conceded that there was no way to catch him. It actually states in the rules that surrender is one way the game can end, so just remember that this kind of thing can happen. 

Fun game, but I do think some other card games seem more refined and flow better, such as race for the galaxy. I also prefer Eminent Domain over this one, but I still keep them all. Oh - and probably Innovation too - but only as a two or three player. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
What I like about this game, as opposed to comparable games like Race for the Galaxy, is that it feels a lot less like multi player solitaire, since you have to choose whether not not to follow the current leader's decision.  

Now that I've gotten more into Race for the Galaxy, I'm not sure which one is my favorite.

Much clearer player interaction than Race for the Galaxy, and the cards are clearer, too.  Lots of strategy options and having to plan a great deal makes this game really interesting.  The only thing I did not like about the game is that toward the end, a couple of players got to keep playing card after card and their turns seemed a bit too fiddly to me.  If this got to the table a bunch, I could see me tiring of it quickly.

UPDATE: It does indeed have a steep learning curve, and I'm still not sure that I can really enjoy it, although I'm beginning to warm up to it a little bit.

Difficult to get your head around at first.  I love the direct interaction - "Oh no!  I can't use this card as a role because then it's in the pool available to my opponent as a material! AGHGHGH!"

The most direct comparator is Race for the Galaxy. The role selection and engine building are a lot similar to Race, but Glory to Rome allows and encourages far crazier combos, reminiscent of Innovation, only here they're more planned and less chaotic, though no less dramatic. Compared to Innovation, there's more control, with a heavier tilt toward strategy over tactics. Overall I prefer this to the rather staid Race for the Galaxy. And while I still love Innovation best with two, Glory to Rome is probably better for more than that.

RATING: 7.5
It's sort of like San Juan, but much more complicated. Players will be taking a variety of roles that allow you gather material (wood, rubble, concrete, marble, brick, stone), start/work on buildings, attract clients (who allow you to take these roles more than once a turn), attack their neighbors (demand material), and sell resources for money (VP). When the start player chooses a role (playing a card from their hand), others in turn can either follow (play same color card) or "think" -- draw up to hand limit (5), Jack (wild card for roles), or 1 card if already at hand limit. Then, starting with start player, resolve the roles. Pass the Leader (start player) card.

Every card (6 colors) has multiple functions:
- Role: corresponds to color, and is written on the left.
- Material: corresponds to color, and shown at bottom
- Influence: modifies how well you can do things; shown on top
- Building: description at center (usually gives additional power)
There's a unique mechanism where there are a pool of cards in the center of the table. After a role has been chosen and used, those cards are added to the pool. Roles allow you to move cards around: from pool to stockpile (under player mat), from stockpile to vault (right of player mat), from hand to stockpile or building sites (next to player mat), from pool to client area (left of player mat). When you start a building, you take the card and add it to a foundation card (taken from supply); this indicates how much material you need to complete the building. When it's done, the site card is flipped and moved to top of player mat -- shows influence (and VP). 

There's more -- off site locations, bonuses for types of cards in vault -- but that's the gist.

The player mat takes some getting used to, but is actually quite a clever system. Having a pool of cards is also nice -- even if you don't draw what you need, you'll have access to cards that other players draw and use.

I may have to get this game, although with Race for the Galaxy (which also shares some mechanisms with SJ, but is also more complicated and interesting) coming soon I'm not positive ....
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
It's great fun, and I actually like the art.  My experience after only one game is that it ended rather fast and without warning because of one special building.  The game ended in a three way tie, which is a little unsettling as well.  However, the game play is very fun, interactive, and challenging enough to keep me interested...more so than Dominion.  Glory to Rome!

A convoluted, confusing, messy card game that nevertheless kicks the hell out of RftG.  

Like many, I hate the art on the original, so I'm looking forward to checking out the Black edition.

Rating is very tentative right now.  It seems like the type of game I would like and maybe my eyes will open upon further plays.  I understand the rules much better now, but it's one of those games I wouldn't request.  I can take it or leave it at this point.  I've read some comments that it's like Race for the Galaxy, a game I don't like because it's too confusing, the opposite of elegant simplicity.  I think there's some of that going on here too, but maybe I'll change my mind and like it more if I give it more time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game seems, to me, like a deeper version of Race for the Galaxy.  Don't get me wrong, I still like Race for the Galaxy way more.  It has more variety, better theme, better art, and just goes down a lot smoother.  But this is a great game as well with a lot more depth and harder decisions.

The follow-the-leader mechanic in this game takes on a slightly new twist from others like Puerto Rico and RftG.  Instead of leading with a role (whether you are the only one who can choose it or not) and getting a bonus while others get a weaker version of that action, in Glory to Rome the leader and all his followers get to take the same action (sometimes a follower can even do more depending on his clientele).  The twist is that depending on what your opponents have in their hand they may not be able to do anything.

In this game you build a kind of tableau of Rome (another similarity to RftG) and every card can be one of 5 different things in the game (a client, a resource, influence, Victory Points, and an action card).  Knowing when and how to use them offers a huge amount of depth on how to play the game.  I wish there was more variety to the cards but that is just me being greedy, there's enough here to keep you interested for a long time.

I also have the Black Box edition so I wasn't subjected to the horrible clip-art-laden color vomit of the original.  The new art is very stylish.  It's not my favorite thing in the world, but it looks nice.  Unfortunately the black ink they used for the backs of the cards and covers of the rulebook rubs off on EVERYTHING.  I sleeved my cards so it's not as bad but could they really not use a better printing method besides what I assume must be chimney soot?

Despite how good this game is and how much I enjoy it I may end up getting rid of it.  There just doesn't seem to be any room in my game group's hearts for this one with RftG so good at everything this game does.

Initial impression after 3 learning games and 1 standard game.  Very nice!!  I can see this becoming a favorite. A couple of new concepts keep me thinking about this one:
  The Clientele, which you can customize to suit your strategy, lets you draw cards and still use their abilities.
The Pool, where all the discards go, is a more strategic idea than a discard pile making you aware of how other players could use what you've just played.
The Vault.  O.k., stealing building materials to sell (gaining you points) is just fun. ;)

I think my rating will go up with more plays using the buildings' powers.

I have a hard time even talking about this game.  It seems to have taken the race for the galaxy role selection and supercharged it with “Clients” that you can hire to add a bonus actions when those roles re selected.  This seemed to be the most significant innovative mechanic.   

In my first play I had a little trouble getting my head around the rules and ended up losing 7 to the winners who tied with 24;  qite a crushing.  It is a good thing the whole endeavor took a total of 30 minutes.  I would like to play again.

As a fan of 'combo card games' like Race for the Galaxy and San Juan, I enjoy Glory to Rome tremendously. But because of the high level of chaos and randomness, it's hard to play it very seriously. That prevents it from getting a 10, but is *is* very entertaining.

Holy cow!  This is quite honestly the best game of I've played in a long time.  It is a gazillion times better than 7 Wonders...in fact I wonder if 7 Wonders will come out again.  GtR is longer, has a better arc, and has a great rolling power curve which you get to actually keep playing after your powerful combinations come out.  So many game end right as your carefully crafted combos begin to work, but with GtR you actually get to play and grow those combos even bigger.  It's fresh, with tricky decisions at every turn, a play time that is neither too short, nor does it outstay its welcome--in fact right about the time you think someone has solidly taken the lead, the game ends.  I look forward to many many more plays of this one, it's absolutely brilliant!

A brutal knife-fight of a two-player game--oddly reminds me of Aton in that with 2, you are constantly watching the point totals, and trying to keep in mind whats been moved to the Vault--still though right when youre ready to hammer the game to a finish, your opponent pulls out the necessary VPs to make the ending uncertain, or a certain loss.

RATING: 6.5
This is a "first impression" rating after a single 2-player "learning" game in which we played with all the building abilities.  I have to remark first of all what a clever game this really is!  The game design is quite amazing, and even the visual design isn't as bad as popular opinion seems to state.  Sure, the artwork is cheesy, but there's something to be said for clarity.  I saw one re-theme that had much cooler images, but it was much harder to make out all the different elements on the cards, which isn't a problem with the original cards.  As for our 2-player game, it was a bit of a blowout.  I won a "Forum" victory, but I was also way ahead in victory points thanks to a powerful Wall -> Sewer -> Foundry combo.  It makes me think that perhaps this game is not at it's best with 2.  With future 2-player games, I think I'll remove the Catacombs, and instead of the Forum being an automatic win, say that it provides the player with 3 VPs and ends the game if the player has the Forum and one of each client.  Of course, with more knowledge of the many different buildings, it will perhaps be easier to counter your opponent's building combos.  Overall, it was an interesting game that lacked a bit in the "fun" department, perhaps because there was so much to think about with the first play.  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 2.5/5  Total: 6.5/10

Crazy card game with many ways to develop, broken combos and a lot of interaction.

+ Card game - A genre that i favor.
+ Design - An example of wonderfully designed mechanics.
+ Smart - Lots of strategical and tactical decisions.
+ Diversity - Lots of different buildings/abilities to experiment.
+ Interactive - Most decisions also affect other players .
+ Addictive - I want to play again!

+/- Broken - Some card combos can be too strong, but that is ok, as the game offers opportunities to stop others from achieving them or counter them with your own broken combos!

- Sometimes it occurs that someone is super-developed and someone else is next to zero.
- Ambiguous artwork - Most people don't like it at first glance. I have come to like it after some plays, but it could be improved. The choice of "strong" colors help gameplay a lot.

After spending a few hours reading up on the rules and strategy for this game, I came to realize that there are actually methods to this madness and the deck is less random than I originally estimated. https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/84903/basic-strategies-glory-rome 

That said, making a blunder early on hurts nearly as badly as it does in chess. Sometimes it will be impossible to recover and you will spend the next hour painfully losing. (Discuss resigning policy for the table before beginning a game.) Legionary actions, Bridges and Coliseums are all direct attacks on opponents. Bottom line: play this game when you're in a good mood and have a cup of coffee.

RATING: 7
[Cambrige Games 2007 I.V edition] {Ancient; hand-management, card-drafting; optimal 4p}  GR2 is an amazing game: full of tactical options and player interaction.  It's difficult to teach G2R effectively esp. when a card servers several functions.  A clearly multifaceted game - there are different ways to get score and players can create their own strategies for winning.

Certain card combo is quite strong but I don't find any balance issue in this game.  However, in my first impression, the luck factor is higher than necessary (in this regard, I prefer Race for the Galaxy).  Esp. if a player has several good building at early game, they could win the game easily.

A problem is that it needs several plays to understand and master this game - long learning curve.

The production quality is so so.  The cardstock is too thin for durable play.  However, I like the card illustration.

[Variant] The Petition and Forum is a good start for beginners; however, I think it can be dropped when players are more experienced with the game.

RATING: 6
Some people in my group love this game.  I find it pretty much an all-around apathetic "meh" of an experience.  The production quality is mediocre; I don't find the art as eye-gougingly painful as some of my compatriots, but I don't think it's good by any means, and the cards are extremely busy.  This is the second recent game I've played with the giant chaotic discard pile mechanism (Mwahaha! being the other), and I find it somewhat distasteful.  The mechanics are incredibly counterintuitive, and while I find some slight amusement in how incredibly overpowered nearly all the cards seem to be, I find that in practice it doesn't mesh well. (Like To Court the King, I sort of feel like the game resulted from a bunch of guys just sitting around going "You know what would be AWESOME?  If there was a card that did this, but on CRACK!" with little regard to balance or flow.)  

There are some little bits of genius in the game; I think the four-sided cards that function in four different ways depending on how they're placed under your mat are inventive, but the way that this is displayed is too busy and hard to make out.  I'll play this when others want to, but only because it's short enough that I find it just a mild timewaster, rather than an exercise in frustration.

You know those classic books that everyone tells you you have to read and that you start a couple of times but can't really get into?

Mechanics should be interesting, but it felt very slow paced and clunky.  You have to go twice around the table on each action.  You are almost entirely dependent on other players to put cards into the pool, so if no one else plays a card you want, you simply can't get it.

One of the finest card games ever made. It's an enormously strategic affair as you attempt to erect a variety of buildings which in turn provide various benefits to you once completed and also score victory points. The cards are multi-purpose and can be used as the buildings themselves, building materials or professions that aid you in your attempt to progress through the game. Due to the enormous variety provided by the cards it means that the decisions you make become an intriguing balancing act as you try to optimise the most productive way of selecting/playing them. The artwork looks as though it was taken from a children's history book, and it can be a fiddly game to play as you try to fit numerous groups of cards under your play area, but apart from that it's a fantastic experience.

+ In the category of card games it's really very good. Yes, it's based on random cards draft, but the core of GtR is "let's try to squeeze the best from what I've received". Very tactical, with some amount of nasty interaction and very sweet combo buildings. 

- Graphics and components are awful, but if you speak Polish, German or French, there are national editions that look much better.

There's a good game here with the admitably fun swings of fortune but not when it overstays it's welcome and then ends with an auto-win condition or building.  Also fiddly and requires significant staring across the table trying to read small upside down text to ensure another play isn't sneaking in a win. 

There's a place for this sort of game but I'm not going to force my group to put in the effort to discover it. I'd rather spend the time with RftG.

tl;dr: great but you have to live with the luck

This game is sort of a predecessor of my all time favorite game: [thing=28143][/thing]. OK, that game was build on the foundations of [thing=8217][/thing], but it did one main thing very different: the huge amount of different, unique cards. Glory to Rome also has that, and cards that can be used in a lot of different ways. It allows players to explore a ton of different strategies over a big amount of games. Of course, just like in RftG you have to work with the cards you get and adapt your strategy accordingly. So there is a certain luck factor that you have to live with. And the buildings that can end the game early can be annoying for other players, but that's easily fixed.
I have the 4th edition that comes with the flashy colors. It's ugly as hell but it's also extremely functional. I don't think I've ever played the black box edition. It looks nicer but I'm not sure it's as clear.
In any case: good, exciting game!

I bought this because so many people claimed it to be the most underrated game out there.  It seemed a bit confusing at first, but there are a lot of fun concepts in this game.  I think the coolest thing (which is also one of the potential drawbacks) is all the building abilities you can get.  With so many abilities, ranging from suck to overpowered, it's difficult to control what you get.  The nice thing is that there's typically a good selection on the board to choose from (or even from your hand).  Very dynamic play and replayability is high.

The unattainable grail status gives it a grander reputation than it deserves. This game is broken in some key areas with specific combos that are bordering on unstoppable. Sometimes there's just nothing you can do, and it can be frustrating to watch an opponent just slaughter everyone because they happened to get dealt Road and Scriptorium first. 

But I like it and I'm glad I own it. People obsessing over getting a copy of this should really just buy Mottainai, which is a tighter, balanced filler version of GtR, and in many ways a better game.

I really like Glory to Rome, maybe more than I like Race for the Galaxy.  The cartoony art doesn't bother me any, but just like Race, the game is a rush to points and you should not concentrate on building up ideal situations rather than speed and a quick end game.

If I could actually find this game for a fair price I would get it, but that seems impossible for the moment.

Race for the Galaxy has simply been replaced.  I might still play Race for the Galaxy, but I really have no desire to usually.  I'd rather play this.

Tentative rating after one play. I have mixed feelings, though.  I felt like I was in dead last the entire game...and it turned out that I came in second, and nearly won.  So, the multiple paths to victory and slightly obfuscated current victory standings are, I think, good things.

A lot of comparisons have been made between this game an RftG.  Note...I gave RftG a horrible rating, due to a lack of player interaction.  This game...does not have that problem. Everything you do has an impact on your opponents...and what they do has a direct impact on you. That's a major plus.

Update: Bumped up to an 8 from a 7 after a couple more plays. Very cool.

RATING: 9.5
Easy-to-play card game with crazy building powers. The first times you play it seems some buildings are broken and some combos shouldn't exist... but after some more plays, you realise the game is balanced.

The game has more strategy that what it seems. There are multiple paths for winning, with plenty of combos available. It is still a game with a lot of fun, even when experts are playing with first timers. I won't recommend for 2 people: the game gets broken when someone finishes a powerfull building. For 3-5 is definitively one of the funniest short games.

Supposedly the father of multi-use cards, was enthused to try it, but was a big disappointment. It did no age well, whenever you want to do something it is really convoluted to do so and it is less about the excitement of "what brilliant combination comes up?" and more about the luck of the draw. Not a terrible game, but it does not live up to its hype at all.

I enjoyed this. The multipurpose card thing is a little schizophrenic, and it's funny how the game makes zero sense up until the moment where it makes perfect sense.

GtR is the first real tableau-builder I've played, so my rating is basically arbitrary until I know how other tableau-builders play.

My guess is that it's not good enough to justify a $100+ pricetag regardless. :)

Good game, but probably too much praised.
The basic version is strategically much more interesting than the advanced one, where the excessive number of variability makes all the game too dependent on luck.
a few cards are terribly unbalancing.
Anyway, a very good effort, and a game to be played from times to times in my group

What a novel card game. When I first heard of if, I thought, "Oh, just another game that cleverly uses cards for different things." but now that I've played it, I find it more than that. Despite the bad art, GtR has several great mechanics working together to create a fantastic game. The ever-evolving Card Pool, the useful Thinking, the slow-and-steady Construction, the Patrons for extra Actions, the Legionnaire for stealing cards from other players. Even if they didn't re-use cards for different purposes, this would have been an interesting game. My only concern is that there seem to be a lot of cards that can potentially be over-powered, and this game could possibly end up to be a game of "whoever who draws the best card wins" type. I think I'll wait a bit before acquiring it for my own.

29-Mar-10: Borrowed this from Gregor last Tues, and taught Cynthia how to play on Sunday. We played 5 games of this afterwards! Cynthia is impressed by the sheer number of Options this game presents to the player. I think this is now a definite Must Buy for us now.

I like that the main mechanic is the role leading and following from Puerto Rico without the other stuff.  The game is chaotic and a bit messy, but it means that every game will have a different feel.  What I dislike is that eventually the game will probably get to a state where there is no action you can take which will not benefit someone else at the table more than you.  Hopefully that player will end the game when that happens.

I prefer this building game with cards over Race For the Galaxy and San Juan. Though not as quick as either of those (nor as intuitive), it is more interactive and to me - interesting. Some don't like the cartoonish, but I like it. The only thing I really dislike is trying to slide the cards under the mat.

RATING: 8
I played it for the first time recently and really like the chaotic nature of the game. The combination of powers and strategies from each player elevate the game higher than its successor, Mottainai. In Glory to Rome, I feel like I have the time to build what I need to build and it does not end as fast as Mottainai. Additionally, the mechanic and thematic seem to integrate better in Glory and easier to understand. I definitely look forward to keep playing it and explore the awesomeness of this game.

Considering how much I play games, I actually knew very little about Glory to Rome.  I saw it on the table once and was completely turned off by the art style.  Now having played it, I still think the art is terrible, but at least the game play is half decent.

It uses mechanisms similar to [thing=3076][/thing] where each player takes an action, then the other players have a chance to follow the actions.  Except, everything felt clunky to me.  It was like they started from Puerto Rico (which is a game I love) - or probably more accurately, San Juan - and added an expansion that made the game worse.  I could see how people thought this was a great game in 2005.  But having come to it new in 2017, if it were released today the game would be a dud.

Fantastic game. So many choices to pick from at every stage, and so much strategic depth. The game goes a little crazy when the really powerful cards come out, towards the mid- to end-game, but that's part of the charm. The painfully ugly card designs have grown on me a little over time; at least they're fun and colourful. I would have traded up to the Black Box version, but although its designs are certainly elegant and beautiful, they just don't look to me like they suit the game.

I'm looking forward to exploring the potential strategies with more plays of this, and particularly looking forward to trying out the expansions that I've just purchased.

Edit: It seems just about everyone but me hates this in our group, so I doubt it will ever see the table again. It seems to be the crazy endings that put them off. They seem unable to see that you have to play the main part of the game well in order to even reach the stage where "the wheels fall off" (as they put it) first and win the game.

Excellent game. Card art has done the publisher no favours as commented many times, but its format is very well thought out easing what could be a very tangled game into a very slick one. I always loved San Juan, and Race for the Galaxy seemed as though it were the natural successor, but I although I appreciate that was a better game I found it too dry. Just didn't seem to have the same fun element of SJ. Like SJ's eldest son that went into accountancy. Then I played Citadels and that was a whole load worse. SJ's mentally deranged offspring that  sat rocking in a corner, pulling the legs off spiders. But then was born Glory to Rome the true success story of the SJ siblings! Better than its parent in every way I think - a big statement to amke on its first play but I think that will hold up. Played with 5, and there is a fairly quick learning of what you should be doing, although some of the chain effects of buildings you can only grasp with some experience under your belt. Gameplay is essentially the same as SJ but with a few extras. Same kind of perfect time frame for a card game of this nature. Highly recommended.

RATING: 6
I found this to be fairly interesting. However, there are definitely some flaws, including some balance issues and the fact that only way to get victory points into your vault is with merchants, and if you are never able to get merchants as clients, you're pretty much hosed. Still there's a lot going on here and many interesting mechanics and card combinations to explore. Ulitmately, though, this game is a bit too long for what it is and I just don't see myself playing this often enough to get to really explore the possible strategies. I'm sure they're there, along with ways to counter a lack of merchants in the pool, but it will be up to others to discover ...

Amazing card game in the same vein as Race for the Galaxy and San Juan, but it is, at the same time, more complex and less serious. This is the best of the bunch despite the cartoony artwork. A lot of strategic options are available and there are some really powerful building combinations that can lead to some crazy high scores. The Forum and Catacombs add nice alternative endings, which can alter one's strategy. I've played this mostly with two players and a few times with 3 and once with 4. All numbers are fun since everybody pretty much gets to act during everyone else's turn. I would imagine 5 is a good number too. This is currently one of my favorite games and imagine playing this for a long time to come. I will probably have to buy another copy since my cards are starting to show some wear after 17 plays. Well worth the price though.

RATING: 7
It's more complex than San Juan, less fiddly than Race, and not as tense as either.  Glory to Rome wins for, "Most Objects Each Card Can Represent Based On Its Tableau Position."  Although a touch bloated and boasting juvenile artwork, Glory to Rome is still a fine outing that deserves a completely different design esthetic when it is reprinted.

This game is an example how to use cards in a game. Give them several ways of use and if you od it in a smart way you can even get a game as great as this one. The original English edition was a sad to look at with cheap and many times ugly illustrations. Compared to other language variations that used different and much better artists it was even more obvious. But thanks to the minimalistic yet brilliant art of the Black Box Edition (and a little drama during the KS campaign) this game is one of the best card games I ever played. If you have opportunity, definitely try it!

RATING: 9
I love the crazy combos and the timing problems that are presented in this game. Up in the air with playing with the MIT secret rule and regular. 2 petition change definitely helps even out the Craftsman and Architect, instead of relying on the players to balance out the Craftsman.

Update: I prefer MIT rules, as you have more options. It also balances the craftsman card flow advantage and buffs the other roles by making the card pool larger.

Rules used: Played with MIT Secret Rules
2 matching roles for petition.
Circus is lead or follow architect with any card.
Forum needs 6 clients and 6 stockpile.

Update: Own black box edition now. Republica rules preferred.

A clever card game that's like a distant cousin of San Juan or Race for the Galaxy.  It took me a while to wrap my head around it my first try but eventually it gets ingrained  (though good luck remembering all the buildings unless you play all the time).

It's crazy how cartoony and amateurish the original art and graphic design is; completely unsuitable for the game.  If I were to ever get a copy for myself, I'd go for the revamped graphic design.

Rebuilding ancient Rome while skimming off the top to create your own personal fortune. Cards are used as patrons (i.e. what action you take), clients, buildings, building materials, and points. The game centers around constructing a powerful combination of buildings and trying to fill your personal vault with as many valuable materials as possible before the game ends.

Sometimes compared to Race for the Galaxy (cards with multiple uses, role selection, building cards with special powers) but I find that it's not quite as deep in terms of variety of strategies. Feels very reactive, hard to plan.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I have played the two games that this is most often compared to (Race for the Galaxy and San Juan), and after two playings, this is clearly the better game.  It is also clearly the more complex, more involved, and more layered game of the three.  There are an incredible amount of ways to win the game, and each one has a foil.  At first, several buildings seem entirely too powerful, though, upon further consideration, they all have strategies that can easily counter them.  This might be the most enjoyable card based game that I own, trumping Race for the Galaxy by no small margin.

UPDATE:  C'mon, this is one heck of a game.  I cannot believe that thousands here froth at the mouth for Race, while this dude toils in obscurity.  Race is OK (the expansion does stick a bit of interaction into the game), but man, GtR is great.  They are two completely different games, Race and GtR, but I personally love Glory to Rome by a landslide over Race.  That's just me.  But I am right.

Not the easiest game to learn, but once you're in the Pool, man, it's good.  The amount of killer combos almost cancel each other out and create a balanced game.  I don't think anyone I know - myself included - is "good" at this game yet, but I'm certain it's a game that rewards skillful, clever play.  It's a lot of fun.

As for the art -- a lot of it is fine!  The bright colors make it easier to spot what cards people have as clients, or what's in the pool.  Some of the building artwork is attractive, or at least not bad.  But why oh why is the illustration for the Palace an MS Paint drawing of a man wearing nothing but a towel in front of a column?  Is this some sort of anti-Nero political cartoon?  Really, if they'd picked one art style, it would have been fine, but they've got five different ones, each with a different color palette, all crammed in the same little box.

Solid card game! To bad it's out of print because Black Box edition is one I would definitely buy. Difficult to explain (especially if booze is involved) but worth the first game slog through. Good solid fun with 3 players seems good with 4 as well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The gameplay is similar to Race for the Galaxy because of the different roles, but this one still feels a lot different for me because of the theme and the different ways to use the cards. Because the cards have so many different uses (patrons, buildings, resources, victory points) this game is very replayable.

Even though the whole point of the game is that some of the card combinations can be very overpowered, I have seen several games where somebody can get a good card or combo really early and then just win the game with no competition.

Sold.

Glory to Rome, a game that became very, very popular in my Tally boardgame group.  I find this game to be an amped up on steroids version of San Juan in many ways.  The plusses are that there are numerous strategies and a myriad of powerful cards that can be played from the beginning of the game.  The downside is that Glory to Rome can be very chaotic at times with the gradual strategies and subleties found in San Juan and Race for the Galaxy tossed to the side(not as bad as Fluxx, but more than a few games have been roller coaster rides).  Overall, this game is a worthy and fun addition to a collection--now if they could only reprint it......

lowered .5 simply because the Catacombs is stupid if it comes out early, makes the game about not letting that player come close to winning, and any moment during the game, that idiot can decide to throw the switch, losing on purpose and playing kingmaker.

Great game! But it's definitely not going to please everyone. One downside to it I've noticed is that it will often have the run-away leader problem. If you are the type that enjoys never saying surrender, and maintains excitement even when you feel you have very little chance to win for the last several rounds, AND, you can handle a very steep learning curve, Glory to Rome may be for you.

A great game where each card can be played in multiple ways, ie, as a role, client, material or a building.

This game has quite the cult following and I think it is because it was unknown for so long and the art gets a bad rap.

The art doesn't bother me at all, in fact it is very clear and it reminds you this is supposed to be fun.

I have only played 6 2-player games, but it feels a little "messy" to me.  Still, I rate it 7.5 and that may go up over time and if I play with more people.

Update: Downgraded to a 7.  I just wish there were more going on in the "pool" in a 2-player game.  I guess I just need to play this with more.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 4
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 3
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 4
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 2

I had sold this years ago after playing it a few times at low player counts and finding it really lackluster.  I liked Innovation (which is probably better at 2-3) but kind of wrote this off as an "I just didn't get it" game.

Flash forward several years and I got to play it with a full set of 5 players and it was really excellent.  The action selection and pool manipulation really shines with more players and the game comes into it's own very nicely.

I don't know if it's worth what it's going for these days but if you frequently have 5 players and like a card game with a lot of interesting, seemingly overpowered plays and a lot of meta to the game play then this could be really shine for you.

EXCELLENT quick card game of nastiness and why the heck not!?!?!

Those who do need to remove whatever it is they have firmly planted up their arse and get over themselves.

Many possibilities, a nice level of interaction, a vast space for strategy and "thinking" (inside joke).

With more players the game usually takes longer to end, but that is fine, since the game is also more "alive", with card power, Rome demanding things and such.

Cambridge Games Factory got it very much right this time.

RATING: 8
This is a pretty unknown gem. Flawing arts in the beginning editions haven´t really helped it, but this is a 'gamers game' much meatier you can think at first look. There are many good things inside this 'goofy' game: many and often hard choices every turn, a fair amount of strategic paths (specially in 2P where you have more control), several endgame conditions. With 40 different buildings/powers, you must try different strategy/tactical choices every game, providing a great replayability. In spite of some lucky draws, you have plenty of opportunities for skillful play here, and you can definitly 'control your luck' with clever play. Every card in your hand may be played in 3 different ways (role, building, material)!, making many cutthroat decisions you have often to take. 

There are plenty of 'broken' powers in the buildings, but GtR is surprisingly well balanced. In some games, you will able to find solutions to counter your opponents combos, because buildings take usually several turns to build before being 'activated'. However other games will be a race, and the first player breaking the game will win. With 2P, I definitly recommend republican rules, 3 sites/color.

What a gem this game is. I love the swingy wonkiness of it. The theme and the art is just so much more appealing to me than RftG and it doesn't have the confusion of its iconography either. Takes a couple of plays to get your head around the rules though.

So many more options than you get with San Juan and Race for the Galaxy.  Unlike SJ and Race, the game does not feel like one where you have to play a card every round (SJ) or turn (Race).  It plays longer, so you have more time to plan and react to what the other players are doing.

The triple-use cards intrigued me a lot. While the one game  I played (4 players, including only 1 experienced player) moved a little slow, the game system has been invading my thoughts recently. I'd be happy to try this RftG++ more, and see if the extra complexity adds extra fun.

Wonderfully deep card game with tons to think about, and there are many paths to victory. Randomness of some cards can bring a win where it may not be deserved.

The box is one of the unfortunate casualties in the Black Box kickstarter print run; the adhesive was poorly applied and so the box cover shows some "bubbling" and the box itself is a bit warped.  Otherwise, all the contents are there and in excellent condition.

Incredibly well designed card game which gives you so many interesting and varied paths to victory that you'll have a hard time picking one...
One of the more enjoyable aspects of the game is how every ability can feel so overpowered you feel like you're accomplishing so much (even if another player is accomplishing just a little bit more).

This is one of my top games of all time and an auto-shoo in for starting or ending the gaming evening. 

Subtle, varied, frustrating and deep.

My only criticism is the artwork - fine, but too jokey for the gamer feel; would look fantastic as a formal art 'special deluxe edition'...classic!

I had been hoping that the new edition would improve the game, but my play of it was much worse than my plays of the older version (which were OK but not spectacular). There seem to be a number of really unbalanced buildings, such as the Garden. It's still possible to get into cycles where you can't do much through little or no fault of your own. And, it's still a fairly messy design. 

I'd be willing to play it again, since it's not too long and I like some bits of the system, but that feeling may not last more than another play.

After playing again many months later, I was much more impressed. I found it to be a tense and exciting tableau builder, and had a similar feel to Race, although the games are mechanically nothing alike. I like the alternate endgame conditions. I must have been playing wrong the first time, as it went on for over two hours. This is a really enjoyable game that I am looking forward to playing again.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Original comment: I have no idea why this keeps getting compared to Race for the Galaxy. The two games are barely similar at all, only in the fact that both are card games that use the variable phase order mechanic, and have multiple uses for cards. I guess both games are supposed to occupy similar niches, but Race is deeper, more strategic, streamlined, and packs a ton of game into a short time fame, while Glory has more luck, has runaway leader problems, is overly fiddly, and overstays its welcome, having no clear end in sight and becoming tediously repetitive. I can see it improving after more plays, but for now I have to say that I am sincerely disappointed. I have only played once, so maybe I need to play more to appreciate it, but I would much rather play something else than spend my time playing this again.

I can definitely see why this game has its own appeal -- much like Race, it's got that Puerto Rico influence, and it does a lot more on the interactivity. I'd still recommend Race over this for any size, because Race is the bestest game ever, but it's worth trying out on its own and enjoying.

Be eager to try this out with groups of 4-5!

RATING: 9
very very interesting and cool game. 
You try to gather the most victory points. I like the multirole cards. You can use them as an action, material, building ground or you can even "build" them and then use their specific action.
On your turn you will announce an action to take and everyone gets the decision to follow and make the same action or "think" and draw cards.
As soon as a certain amount of buildings are built or the building grounds run out, the game ends.
There are many roles for the gameplay but each goes very smoothly into gameplay, this game is perfectly balanced and playtested.
Huge recommendation on this one :)

Great card game, but is this one balanced at all? I got to build some just amazing buildings early on and completly crushed my oponents. I can't see how not to win if you build the best buildings from the start of the game. I might upgrade it later on if I find out that the game have different victory paths than being the first to build a couple og great buildings.

Role selection game with the cards serving lots of different functions.  Puerto Rico had lots of interaction.  San Juan was a good card game translation but lost a lot of the interaction.

This game seemed very familiar, resembling at times parts of other games.  Lot of choices and not as much random drawing as one might expect from a game with a good sized pile of cards.  I think we'll be getting this.

Well, we've got it and have played two and three player.  Don't think we're familiar enough with everything to do anything other than just scratch the strategic surface.

1st update (Feb 2011)[9]: WONDERFUL card game. I really love playing it, it's fast, fun, loads of combinations, loads of interaction.

Glory to Rome, how I love thee!

One of my favorite games.

This is "Race for the Galaxy" on steroids: far more player interaction, more interesting (even insane) combos, and above all, way more laughter.

In its mechanics it's a Euro game through and through, but it produces the guffaws and the groans, the whooping and the curses, the delicious relish and the anxiety and all the drama normally associated with Ameritrash games. I.e., the best of both worlds. I cannot recommend it enough.

Played a 5p game, this may have made the game experience slightly worse. However, trying to look away from that and focus on the game. The bad side is that this is probably the fiddliest card-game I have played, I mean it really blows my mind how you can make it so convoluted with just cards. Basically it could be done a little more convoluted if the cards would have backs that also had a use. It feels a bit like complexity for complexity's sake and it doesn't hold up to game design standards of today. The good sides are many, the major good being multiple strategic possibilities which all can get you victory, the other being creative use of cards and some interesting mechanics.

I thought I had built my expectations too high with all the hype I've heard, but the game somehow managed to exceed those high expectations. Very good chance of moving to a 10 (I don't give 10's until a game has proven I'm still obsessed with it a year later).

A lot like [gameid=28143] or any of the other games where you use cards as currency.  I like the thematic touches on this one just a bit better, although like many people, I don't care for the art of the edition I played (first).  It's low budget, and it looks it.  The cartooniness isn't a problem, but when combined with the very flat color backgrounds, then it looks really bad.  As for the game itself, I hate RftG, so it should come as no surprise that I don't care for this game either.  I guess, if forced to pick one, I would pick this one, as I like the hand management of this one a bit better.  Following roles is kinda neat, but I just don't like making cards the currency you use to do other things.  I'd rather have something else that feels more thematic.

I enjoyed my two plays and even won one, but I certainly like San Juan more. This was certainly more complicated, and there were lots of wild combos and buildings possible, but I guess I'm just not at the point where I need more than the simple experience San Juan gives.

(after 3 5 player games of version I.V.)  The game does have a learning curve of a game or so, but I look forward to many more plays of this.  If you dislike the Icons on Race for the Galaxy and would prefer text - then this is the game for you.  There might be a little more luck with the cards in this one, but it is a card game and it is about hand management.  Would like to try it with 3 or 4 and see if it gets a little better.  If your game group liked San Juan and or likes Race for the Galaxy, then one of you (or more) should pick this up to try it out.

Played once so far.  The person who taught it to me mentioned that in some ways it was similar to Race for the Galaxy (which I don't care for all that much) - so I was a bit leery.  However, where RFTG is very non-intuitive for me, I was able to catch on to this game fairly quickly.  I rather enjoyed it.  I think that upon more plays I would enjoy it even more.  Game play is fairly fast and straight forward.  I would definitely play this again.

Based on a single two-player play. Feels like a more involved, interactive and complex version of Race for the Galaxy - a good thing. The Black Box edition has good card stock and clear, minimalist design. Slightly humorous for the sleek look (knocking down a latrine to build a road caused much amusement). Probably better than Innovation, which was baffling and 'meh' on first play. Easier to learn than I'd been warned - husband read the rules and then filled me in.

This is a card game with crazy combos. Thinking outside of the box is highly encouraged and ability to adjust on the fly is a must (especially in larger games). It plays well with 2 players and scales very nicely up to 5. Unfortunately, the merchant role is broken which makes the game one-dimensional after a while.

Impressive game with some flaws. Reminds me some of Race for the Galaxy. I think the flaws *might* be some card imbalance and I'm not a fan of the forum way to end the game. That said... after three plays I keep wanting to play this. Rating might go up.

RATING: 6
Let me start with the bad -- learning the game from the rulebook is a pain.  I had read through the rules before sitting down to play our first game, but what I really should have done was play a solo game before inflicting this on my opponent.  No joke, I heard YAWNING.  He swears it wasn't me, but hell, I was getting impatient with myself.  As a result, the learning curve on this game is a little steep.  If you're not playing this with some patient players, there's a good chance you'll ruin the game for them.  There's also the packaging, which I don't like at all.  There should be a more convenient way to package this game so that the cards aren't in three separate deck boxes in a plastic container.  I will be working on a method to condense this game ASAP....

Luckily, that's the worst I can say about the game.  The rest is an appealing little ditty along the lines of San Juan and Race for the Galaxy, two games I've taken a shine to over the past couple of years.  Glory to Rome takes that basic principle of the game and gives it more choices and more turn angst.

BASIC GAME: The basic game is challenging enough in its own right, and is a great way to learn how the game flows.  I think if we had tried playing with the special powers of the buildings for our first game, we would have been overwhelmed and may have given up on it.  But learning how to manage your hand, and develop a plan over a number of turns, is a nice challenge in and of itself.  I look forward to the advanced game, which I think will definitely improve upon a solid design.

ADVANCED GAME: The buildings' special powers change the game from being a tactical one to a strategic one, since the different buildings allow you to try for different win conditions and different card combos that will allow you to follow one path over another.  It adds an element of chaos to the proceedings, since the abilities are rule-breakers, but the added strategy makes that chaos worth it.  It's definitely more apparent to see the chances for strategy in this chaos than in Innovation's chaos.

The Black Box edition is nice, but I didn't see it as being terribly necessary.  The artwork is nice, but it's easier to see the different types of cards using the more garish colors of the previous editions.  The improvement in card stock is nice, but I can see the edges of the cards scuffing up in a hurry.

ADVANCED GAME: The buildings' special powers change the game from being a tactical one to a strategic one, since the different buildings allow you to try for different win conditions and different card combos that will allow you to follow one path over another.  It adds an element of chaos to the proceedings, since the abilities are rule-breakers, but the added strategy makes that chaos worth it.  It's definitely more apparent to see the chances for strategy in this chaos than in Innovation's chaos.

Quite demanding game. This won't be love from the first sight to casual players. It needs time to reveal it's beauty and depth. Anyway, I prefer Uchronia to GtR. The latter is for AT or LCG players. Uchronia is definitely more Euro. Choice is yours.

In 64 A.D., a great fire originating from the slums of Rome quickly spreads to destroy much of the city, including the imperial palace. Upon hearing news of the fire, Emperor Nero Caesar races back to Rome from his private estate in Antium and sets up shelters for the displaced population.
\13\\13\
Reporting directly to Nero, you are responsible for rebuilding the structures lost in the fire and restoring Glory to Rome.
\13\\13\
Glory to Rome is a card-based city building and resource management game with a novel mechanic. Each card may act as a building, a patron, a raw material, or a valuable resource, frequently forcing players into difficult decisions regarding how each card should be used. In addition, much of the game is played from the discard pool, giving players some control over what cards are accessible to opponents.
\13\\13\
Scoring is a combination of completing buildings and storing resources, with end-of-game bonuses for storing a diverse assortment. Game length is player-controlled, and is triggered in a few different ways.
\13\\13\
The lighthearted artwork and slim rulebook belie the strong strategic and tactical elements of Glory to Rome.

Glory to Rome ticks every box on my list of things to love in a board/card game. Multi-use cards, engine building, asymmetric and rule-breaking card powers and multiple paths to victory. It also leans heavily on the design philosophy that as long as every card is over-powered, then none of them are. Much like Carl Chudyk's later design Innovation, this makes for some rather random and swingy gameplay in your early games. Once you've played through a few games, it becomes much easier to reign in the chaos and plot a course to victory, using the crazy card powers to accelerate your plans, or to slow down your opponents.

It's criminal that this has gone out of print. Hopefully that works itself out and get this back into player's hands as it is one of the few games worth of it's grail status.

RATING: 8
Really neat card game. It's hard not to compare to the Puerto Rico card adaptations because of the role mechanic, but this one feels quite a bit different. I think GtR has a much better mitigation of randomness than San Juan or Race for the Galaxy in terms of what options you have available, and I really like the multiple game end conditions; they really add a lot of variability to the game. On the other hand, I've only played this with 2 players, and I suspect it would get really chaotic with more - maybe not. Still, a very fun game, and one I'd be happy to add to my collection despite already owning RFTG.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Once you figure out the multiple-use cards, this game is very easy to play.  However, there is an immense amount going on, and it's deeper than it at first appears.  You can tell it shares a common ancestor with Race for the Galaxy and San Juan, yet is different from either of them.

A complex card game in the vein of Puerto Rico and Race for the Galaxy. The cards are multi-use -- they act as building materials, roles, and buildings. It has great potential for crazy combos. The main downside is the cartoony artwork. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Now have the "I.V." edition (2007).  Components are better, but still feel DTP. The box is nice. The artwork remains [b]terrible[/b]: a muted palette and public domain classical figures would be much better. You can feel the San Juan heritage, but it stands on its own (I like it better than SJ, certainly). Roles are constrained by your draw, and the economic cycle is clunky (but intriguing).  The multi-use of cards doesn't generate the angst of SJ or Race for the Galaxy, as the role lead/follow and the slower building pace makes your hand more transparent. But getting the sequence right and being adaptable is challenging and interesting.  The card combinations are great, but you can see untenable positions and runaway leaders: it's more swingy than either SJ or Race.

I had three concerns from the prior edition, and they're all still there: (a) a flat arc/the ease of forcing game end before functions become viable (esp. in 2-player); (b) no rules for trimming the deck size for < 5 players when a crucial part of the game is deciding when to end it; and (c) the Coliseum (it's overpowered, and the solution was not to balance it, but to increase the counter-cards, an approach I dislike as much here as I do in CCGs).

A unique and intriguing game with plenty of very interesting decisions to be made, but I'm not 100% sold on it yet. The multi-purpose cards with super powerful special abilities create a rather weird tableau building system - I don't know if I'm doing alright in the game because I play well or because of the luck of the draw and some random card powers I just happened to get. Sometimes your cards just don't go well together, othertimes the synergy between certain abilities feels almost broken. I guess this is not a game you can judge after only a couple of plays, so I intend to stick with it, play it some more and then form a final opinion.

By the way, Polish edition looks absolutely awesome.

After seeing it referenced for the 5th time I am finally adding it to my wishlist. Sounds interesting. Card driven, resource management + roman. 

Update: 24.11.2011 got my first play. It's actually much easier than the rulebook makes out to learn this game; there are 6 different roles, and a myriad of things to build that enact various benefits upon completion. Very tight strategy; everything has a cost.

Card game where we citizens of Rome restore it to glory from a great disaster.  Try to control the communal pool of assets provided by the emperor. Gain influence and acquire clientele.  Cards are used for their resource, as clientele, or built as a structure with a power. Pretty heavy, dry and abstract for me.  Card art is very plain so there is no visual wow factor if that is important to you.

Glory to rome is een spel dat een betere uitgave verdient. Gelukkig komt die er ook.

De spelers herbouwen Rome na de grote brand. Diegene die de meeste glorie brengt voor Rome wint het spel. De spelers nemen allemaal rollen op zich door kaarten uit hun hand te spelen. Deze kaarten hebben verschillende functies, waaronder een speciale eigenschap als het als gebouw wordt gebouwd.

Het spel zit ingenieus in elkaar, omdat je niet alleen met de kaarten in je hand speelt, maar ook met de kaarten die door iedereen in een gemeenschappelijke pot worden gelegd.

One of my new favorites.  Very challenging to do well.  More direct interaction than 'Race'.  More long-term planning than I first expected.  Starting to see that this game is much deeper and has many more possibilities than I originally thought.  There are some frustrating moments getting up to speed in this game when you seem to go a couple turns without doing much productive.  Excellent balance between need for tactical flexibility and longer term strategic preparations for the big combo of buildings.

Thank you Secret Santa!

The more I play Glory to Rome, the more I enjoy it. Win or lose, I like the variety of things to do with each card and having the ability to plan ahead with cards in hand as well as making pop decisions on cards thrown out by others. The building abilities are elemental to really getting the most of Glory to Rome, and add that one extra level of strategy that just makes this game a favorite of mine.

I have the 'burn your eyes' color edition, but I do much prefer it's cartoony style over the 'black box' edition, which is rather stark in my opinion. No matter, this is one good game!

Glory to Rome is a card-based tableau/engine game similar to Innovation, Race for the Galaxy, San Juan, and other games that make me wish I were never born.

A game with this much self-preoccupation should come with a full-length mirror, hand lotion, and a lifetime supply of skin mags.  "Sweet Patootie" is a personal favorite, though that was discontinued in the late 1940s.

The Kickstarter version includes parents that praise you for every little thing you do, plus hair gel.

Played once (with 2 players). Rating is very uncertain. I have quite a lot of concerns with this game, but most of them are likely to vanish after a few more plays, and I rather liked the general idea. I'm not too fond of the graphics (but that shouldn't prevent me from liking the game itself much better if the gameplay issues prove to be moot). For now anyway, I am very eager to play the game again, maybe with a few more players (I am afraid 5 would be too many unless maybe everyone knows the game well).

There's a definite learning curve to this game - all the info/options are on each card, and there are a fair number of options, so it seems very overwhelming and busy initially. Once you get it, it's not nearly so complex as it seems. There's a nice variety of building effects and possible combos to keep things fresh. The art is simple and very primary coloury, which may give an initial impression of a more simplistic game than it actually is.

My biggest complaint about GtR is that it too easy to end quickly when the Catacombs are built. Group-think seems to play a role in strategies and role selection, which can make plays "samey" despite the random nature of a card game. The multiple uses per card does make for interesting choices but not getting the right cards can stagnate a strategy. Despite my apprehensions, it is a light enough game that I'm "usually willing to play" and rate it a 7.

a cool card game in the vein of Race for the Galaxy level of complexity.  There are tons of cards and interactions, and a basic system of actions that is neat and relatively unexplored.  the vicissitudes are extreme, and that can easily turn off some who are used to the more Euro-steamlined scoring systems, where the range of points between first and last is very slight.  This is a monster game where one person can completely tromp the table.  But that's why it's a quick card game -- just play again!

Slightly disappointed after reading so many positive reviews for Glory to Rome claiming that it offered a lot more varied gameplay than Race for the Galaxy (especially since I'm currently kind of bored with the latter).  Although it's true that there are more options here, but it seems rather unbalanced with the forum being the most powerful and easiest way to victory.  It feels that you must play the game defensively if someone is clearly using that strategy.

Also, I found the symbols and instructions on the cards to be much less intuitive than the icons for Race.  I would even go as far to say the learning curve is much higher, and it'll definitely take more than two games before you can play it without the need to check the reference aide.  The gameplay is also quite restricting in comparison.  For example, an useless card in Race can simply be used as currency.  However, in Glory to Rome that is simply not the case.  You could find yourself holding something unwanted for a very long time with no way to exchange or even to discard it.

Lastly, I thought Glory to Rome was extremely fiddly.  Having to shuffle the cards around to indicate their various states was just such a chore to perform.  I'm not opposed to trying this out some more, but it certainly was not the replacement for Race as I had hoped.

Really interesting gameplay.  It's a shame it's so hideously ugly.  And that cheap non-stackable container doesn't help.  Sorry, but the gameplay is not the only thing.

This is a rather cool and interesting game that I'd like to play more.  Unfortunately, it is very convoluted, which makes that first play pretty rough at first.

Still learning how to play the game correctly. I like the fact that the game can end very quickly, or take a considerable amount of time - and each version required a completely different strategy.

보드엠에서 예약받던 로마에게 영광을 블랙박스 에디션. 장장 9개월의 기다림 끝에 받았다. 피규어 말고 보드게임에서도 예약 후 기다림의 고통을 느낄 줄이야.. 요건 받은 후 다음 달인 9월 9일 다다 모임에서 카인님 등에게 배웠다. 레오레오놈이 아주 부러운 눈길로 쳐다 보던데.. ㅎㅎ

Heard so much about this and love Innovation so hunted down a copy and found one that I purchased from a fellow Canadian. Now to get it to the table to see if it lives up to the hype!

Love this and want to play it more. Would love to get my hands on the Black Box Edition though because (and I know you've heard this over and over) the cards are incredibly gaudy.

Rengeteg lehetőség, elsőre majdnem átláthatatlan katyvasz, de már a próbajáték közben is folyamatosan tisztul a dolog és élvezetes ahogy rájössz az összefüggésekre. Gondolom később még élvezhetőbb a játék, ha felfedezzük a kombókat, de már most is nagyon jó!

After 1 Play: I'm not really sure how I feel about it yet. It seemed really chaotic, but hopefully with further plays it will make more sense.

I have played this game for 10 times. I like its game flow and how it uses the card for different functions. The art of black box edition is beautiful, most of my friends do not like it though. It is hard to find someone to play with in Taiwan.

Just not my kind of game - I was totally lost for the whole game. And in my opinion this has a huge runaway leader problem...

An excellent game of hand management with some great interaction. The powers are a bit tough to wrap your head around, and the comments of an unpolished feel are valid, but it doesn't make the game feel incomplete or anything of the sort. Recommended if you enjoy heavier, complex card games with a distinct American feel.

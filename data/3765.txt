RATING: N/A
A fun game that captures the spirit of space combat as presented on Babylon 5.  I find it to be a fun capital ships & fighters game.  Agents of Gaming lost the license so it's now OOP, but there are several websites and people are still coming out with new ships, scenarios, etc.

As some of the bookkeeping can get overwhelming, we've developed some better status sheets that help us manage our ships and we also use an intertial vector-based movement system rather than the built-in one.  

Currently my favorite game (despite being OOP for many years) and it's going to be played at every game session for quite some time.

Plus, Tyrel Lohr's Star Trek conversions for B5W (http://planetside.firenebula.com) are lots of fun to play as well.  We've been doing TOS-era Star Trek battles using the B5W rules system and it works great.

My main criticism is that the game can be slow.  Using the small fleets we usually play with (less than 10 ships total on all sides), we can get through 1 turn in about 30-45 minutes.  As a typical game of B5W lasts less than 10 turns, we can usually get through a whole game, though sometimes we have to record the ship positions and continue it at a future game session.

RATING: 9
Favourite starship combat game of all time. 1st edition is a bit lacking, I'd give it 6.5 or 7 as the fighters are a bit overpowered and the sheets are not too aesthetic but second edition is great. The game is a bit involved, but not overly so compared to some of its contemporaries. Players set sensors, manoeuvre ships in initiative order with slower/larger ships moving first, then fire weaponry cutting through armour, knocking out weapons and causing criticals to core systems. 

One of the only problems is that, often in combat a ship would lose a side and then be very restricted in the way that it could turn. I felt in hindsight that maneouvring could be more removed from side destruction but beyond that, I enjoy this game a great deal and encourage anyone to seek it out.

I like this game, but only managed to find an opponent once. With better play aids, it could have been gold, but as is it is still fun. I like the theme, and open-ended range brackets are something I'd love to see more of. Complexity is just a bit high for what you get, which is where a redesign of the paperwork would help. I've picked up most of the supplements over time, but don't really have much incentive to do the redesign.

If you want a meaty space combat game, this is for you.  In the medium to high range for complexity, best suited for small task group actions (a few ships and supporting fighters).

What sets this game apart from the rest is the extensive web based support.  There are literally thousands of additional ships from all genres available, with some exceptional designers.  

Check out planetside.firenebula.com for more information.  There's about 40 issues a magazines devoted to the game (generally 20-40 pages each) in PDF format that will give you a good idea of what it's like before you attempt to purchase.

Sadly....this game fell apart when AOG felt the need to pump out so many shoddy supplements. The print quality was just OMG bad. After speaking to a few of their playtest guys I understood why their point values seemed...um...off. They playtested on massive maps, thus altering the "value" of most items when used on a "standard" map.

Huge, huge amounts of bookkeeping and vast numbers of supplements (many now only available on e-bay for  prices artificially inflated by a cabal of unscrupulous sellers) try hard but aren't completely sucessful in making this game un-fun. It does take a _long_ time if there's more than two big ships or two dozen fighters.

A good game if you like tabletop strategy miniature games. The rules are bit obtuse, and open to interpertation in many areas. Smaller ships are more fun!

RATING: 4
I played a friend's homebrewed modification of this game.  As a physics person working in astronomy, he wanted a system that reflected inertial effects the way the show did, rather than simply letting thrust suddenly change directions.  As any major miniatures-based wargame can, our scenarios led to long, multi-hour games.

While game strategy was relatively enjoyable, I can only stand a marathon session very occasionally.  I was also shown how overpowered certain ships were, based on the statistics and rules given in the original game.  While some of these were meant to reflect the TV series, it effectively reduced play flexibility out of need for balance.  For these reasons, I can't rate the game too highly even though I have had decent experiences overall.

Typical overwrought and SF combat game - spurious detail goes before good design. Clunky overall, but the mindless movement mechanics are particularly egregious.  This was a show that really tried hard to represent inertial effects correctly in its combat scenes. The game mechanisms flie in the face of that, having the typical "power boat" style of maneuver. Not just a failure, but almost an affront to the care the show spent on this.

I loved the B5 TV show, and the rules looked good, but the ships themselves were a huge disappointment. Way too different from what was depicted on the show.

RATING: 4
I found it clunky and inelegent, as if they cobbled bits together from other games.  Had ship displays similar to SFB  (thus, very detailed), but movement was igo-ugo, which enabled ships to fly right by one another in 1 turn before they got a chance to fire.  Maybe this was cleaned up, I don't know.  I found it disappointing, as I really wanted to like it a lot more.

This is quite a good one.  Lots of bookkeeping, and it would be quite challenging to run many more than 5 ships, and I'd probably just determine attacks at the moment rather than pre-plot but it has so many goodies and options, you have to like it.  Would be great for team play.

I enjoyed this game mostly for the miniatures and source books. For a while the minis for this game were the only ones I collected and painted (some of the casting quality left a little to be desired, however). Overall the game was good and there was a huge variety in the ships you could play. The combat system was good and the differences among the races were well characterized. However, I felt that the movement system was confusing and my friend convinced me that 3-D movement was possible--giving fighters a huge advantage via loop-de-loops.

Babylon 5 Wars (2nd Edition) is still the best B5 space combat game, even if out of print. Slightly better than its AoG successor game, Fleet Action, and far, far better than A Call to Arms from MGP (who has created questionable - at best - new content for the B5 universe). B5Wars (and, by extension, Fleet Action) was good enough to be considered Official (canon) Babylon 5 background material by the author of the series, J. Michael Straczynski. A Call to Arms does not have that distinction and, based on what we've seen of MGP's work in the B5 universe, never will have that distinction. Pick up a copy if you can find one - truly a great scifi combat game.

I really wanted to like this game, but there was too much wrong with it.  I bought it when it first came out, and there were too many issues we had with the rules.  Assuming these were tweaked/changed (which you could do yourself I suppose), it could be a pretty good game.  Seemed more like a beta version of the game.

This one takes the Star Fleet Battles approach to space combat (lots of detail, lots of small parts to manage) and gives a completely different spin on them.  Very fun, especially if you are invested in this universe, or want a very detailed but very different take on how starships maneuver and fight.

I really like B5W, though I have to say that it does take time to play and you don't want to over do it. The complexity is very good for a captain-level gaming experience with each player having five or fewer ships. Get over the 4,000 - 5,000 point limit on battles, though, and you are looking at taking a good afternoon to get everything resolved.

RATING: 7
Difficult game to define.  It followed the spirit of battles in the TV series well, perhaps 'jumping the shark', as it were, in later supplements.  The two largest criticisms of the game (and I agree with each) are: 
* Initiative based movement simply doesn't work at the speed units in this game move.  A flight of fighters 10 hexes in front of your ship - well outside weapons range - can (if going fast enough) simply pop up behind your ship when it is their move without your vessel ever getting a reaction shot against them across the 10 hexes they suddenly closed
* A tendency to 'weapon of the week' things - each new race added the designers felt the need to add completely new weapons to.  VERY few weapons (and, thus, rules) apply to ALL races, making large battles with several races represented a real rules headache

Overall, though, the game still rates very highly.  The ship designs are fun, the use of momentum in movement is exciting (if simplified), the idea of unshielded ships being torn up by any weapons hit at all adds an urgency to the battles, it plays fast (even for very large fleet engagements) and, as noted, it fits the feel of the series very well.

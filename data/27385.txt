Played once a long time ago, I remember liking it and not many others doing the same which usually sounds like my sort of game, this was back when I didn't have my tastes in games so refined so I need to play it and see how it has held up with my changing palate.

The game easily fits in 30 minutes, which is good. It has more decisions in it than many other potion mixing games and though the strategies are not deep there is enough in it to get more game table time.

Alchemist is a fast playing 'push-your-luck' game of moving cubes around. Sorry, I mean mixing potion ingredients! You have the option on your turn of collecting some ingredients from the supply, brewing a potion that another player previously created (giving you VP and a couple new ingredients), or creating a new potion recipe. To create, you put some ingredient cubes permanently on the board and pick out the VP value of that recipe. Recipes must be created before other players may then copy the original creations.

The game ends when enough ingredients have run out from the general supply. The final twist is when everyone returns the cubes from their personal supplies and reveals a secret ingredient goal they were given at the beginning of the game. The color with the least cubes leftover among players at the end, second least cubes, and so on awards first, second, and third place bonus VP--which can be significant. You are icentivized to eject the most of your secret color cubes "out" of the game without broadcasting the color too loudly so that other players want to keep those cubes "in" the game.

The decisions are decent enough. They don't itch my brain terribly hard. But the game is smooth and fast. I like the player created economy of making potion recipes which in turn define the constraints of how people will trade goods and get points every game. That alone is pretty neat and makes the whole game for me.

RATING: 7
This is an interesting game of contrasts and hard to pinpoint interactions.  Many of the decisions you make are between gaining victory points for yourself versus generating resource cubes for the owner of the recipe.  In many ways you have to think and act somewhat opposite of what you want so that the actions of others generate what you want.   It is this transformation effect that makes the name make sense, but the overall game theme is not really tied in.  The game has a fairly abstract feel to it and much of the play is counter intuitive.  For this reason, I think the game is not well received by many players.  If several plays are completed though, the transformation effects are grasped and the game play is preceived better.  Getting the group to play enough to shift their perception is the hard part.  Overall, I find the game concepts quite interesting, but I think I am likely in the minority on this one.

some people might disagree with me about the rating I gave to this game..
True, this is not easy to learn game.. and the first game is always a bit shaky..
Also I didn't try the expansion yet (I did try the master mode) and it's hard to find people who play it..

But! this game is really amazing! deduction , worker management and a bit of luck.
some of the artifacts are really important and it is mandatory to focus on them too! 
Every game that i played was great and everyone enjoyed. truly a good game!

I wanted to like this, but then, when I started playing, I realized it's just not much there to love. The game seems like a very mathy exercise from start to finish, with not much else going on. The theme, while it somehow fits, seems more of an excuse than anything else.

In the end, you end up not knowing exactly what you're doing, even though the game has not much luck integrated to introduce such unknown variables. You just try to do what you can, and hope the other players follow your lead.

Definitely not my type of game. And the fact that it can lead to huge AP, only lowers it's score. For now, it's a 5, but it might vary in the future.

It's a short economic/puzzle game masquerading as a potion-making game. Each player puts ingredients into potions which then produces one each of two ingredients. The goal is to use up more of your secret ingredient than the other players while also trying to score points for the potions you created and for copying the ones the other players made. It's simple to explain and plays fairly fast.

Weird game.  Reminiscent of Bazaar since you trade cubes to get cubes of a different color (plus some points).  More complicated than Bazaar.  Suffers from both too much control (creation of recipes) and too little control (rapid pace that cubes are used and discarded back in the box).

There is more here than it appears.  Instead of the theme overcoming its components, this felt like a trading in cubes for different cubes games.  Neat concept.  Hard to decipher a clear strategy.  I'd play again, but it's not high on my list.

A unique game that somewhat defies comparison to any other euros, which is a feat in its design.

Luck dependent. Random initial cube draw and turn order for laying down new recipes can really affect this game.

RATING: 4
From the description: "It's a contest of cubes and numbers!" Yup, that's just what it is. Very math-y. The point is to figure out which cubes to use and which cost to set for a potion, to optimize your points and get rid of your colored cubes; and to figure out which of the opponents potions are worth copying. It's would be an interesting game to solve on paper in a game theory class, but it is not fun to play.

A simple color conversion game like Bazaar, but with some secret goals and an element of strategy. What I like most is that you can determine the exact exchange rate and point value of each potion your opponents can make. This is far more interesting than Bazaar, which has random, predetermined conversion tables and formulas. I wonder how the game would change if players were able to use their own formulas. The scoring system is also a little convoluted and it was often hard to tell the difference between yellow and orange on the board.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I like it.  It is a quick game that still has many interesting decisions to make.  I'm not sure at this point what the optimal strategy is, or if there can even be such a thing since much depends on what the other players do.  I like how all the Bazaar-style equations mesh into each other.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I enjoy the concept and the unique type of strategy/puzzle needed to win.  It is only fun to play with 4 or 5 people.  For a 2 player game, the likely winner becomes apparent half way thru the game and can be hard to catch up given you cannot use your own potions and the board is filled up only with your single opponents.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is an interesting game that you don't see mentioned here on the Geek.  The potion building formula mechanics are pretty interesting and remind me just a bit of Tigris and Euphrates (maybe it's just the colored cubes and the way they score at end game).

The game didn't rock my socks but it was worth a play.  There is a bit of depth in the cube resource manipulation and I see this as a game that rewards repeated play.

Very fast to play, you can get a 2 player game done in under 30 minutes. 

Has a Reef-Encounter vibe, but other than that, not a lot else I can compare it to. You have to remain clever and aware throughout the game while collecting ingredients, and laying out your recipe. 

The board and components are nice.

RATING: 7
I liked this game better than I thought I would. At first, it seems a deathly dull affair: after all, what can you do? Create a new recipe, copy one, or pass in order to secure new ingredients. There's no toxic fumes, funny colours or stacks of lead waiting to be turned into gold: in fact, it's all cubes and a few tokens. But looks are deceiving. Underneath the dull exterior hides a rather clever little game which in my opinion gets less attention and perhaps even praise than it deserves. The problems the players face is that they only score points for their recipe [i]once[/i], when it is first created; thereafter, they only get one resource cube from the recipe's ingredients while the person using that recipe gets the points. So an 'easy' recipe should not be coupled with a high point value: you'll just be handing easy cubes and points to the competition. So what the game forces you to do is set up a rather complex trading sequence in which other players use [i]your[/i] cheap recipe to transform some components into others netting you a cheap resource, and then using those cheap resources to use [i]someone else's[/i] expensive recipe to give you points. A great and subtle way of using Nash equilibria, without creating lockout problems.

If in addition you also manage to create a monopoly for a given colour, you can hold back the expensive recipes until the game is nearly over so that others don't really profit from their price. Now since experienced players know about this they will be on the lookout for cheap routes as well, so I suspect that the points obtained for most used ingredient are actually more significant than some reviewers make them out to be. The asymmetric patterns thus set up make sure that different players focus on different ingredients instead of simply piggybacking the cheapest route.

In some remote way, Alchemist reminds me of Die Dolmengötter, but in reverse. Now it's not helping another player in exchange for a position in the dolmen stack; it's setting up something for other players so they help [i]you[/i] elsewhere. Viewed like this, Alchemist is actually quite clever and not at all so easy and average as it is generally made out to be. Unfortunately, you have to learn the ropes by failing a few times, and seeing how the game 'works' in the hands of an experienced player. The style of play may be odd, starting up your strategy too, but they are not so difficult that you won't pick them up in a game or two. So: don't be fooled by its exterior; play a few games and [i]think[/i] about what you're trying to achieve; and then try to see how it 'works' before passing judgement. It was an unlikely addition to my collection, but one I'm not in the least having second thoughts about.

RATING: 5.4
What I can say about this game is that it's unique.  Players put down combinations of tiles to form "recipes" in various cauldrons, which then can be replicated by other players to get points and the resulting tiles.  This challenges you to leave your options open and have a good variety of tiles on hand at any one time.

There is also a twist of playing with the "schools" where you try to make your key ingredient the one that gets used the most.  But I find this very difficult to manipulate in a meaningful way.

A curious little puzzle of a game, but it leaves me cold.

A solid and interesting system. You have to create potions and give them a point value. Duplicates of the potion can be made - but only by your opponent(s). This creates the need to balance the number of potions you create, and pair them with appropriate values (ie, easily created potions should not be given high values, since your opponents will reap an inordinate amount of points for their efforts). 
You also have a secret ingredient which you try to make the other players use - giving you a hidden agenda and adding another degree of subtelty to your potion balancing-act.

I almost didn't buy Alchemist because I read several comments about it being dry, repetitive, light and unexciting. Good thing I went with my instincts on this one. I really enjoyed the game, and found it to be enigmatic yet fun. If you like a little thought with your games, I would highly recommend it.

Alchemist has an interesting start where you set up victory point engine, but the engine can only be used by other players.  Once that is done, players use the engines to brew up potions fo gain points and resources.  I liked the board and components, but the gameplay did not draw me in.  Repeat plays would help me get a better start to the game, but I am not sure it is worth the time to find out.  A game called Bazaar does the second half of this game much better.

Usually a designer tells you in advance what the formulas are for turning one thing into another thing and then those things into victory points.  In Alchemist, the players establish those relationships, which makes for a mind-boggling, brain-burning experience.  I can't even begin to describe the wheels that turn within wheels in this game, but it's clever and I kind of like it.

In Alchemist players trade (removing from the game) some resource cubes to get victory points and a couple of other resources, according to some trade laws defined by the players themselves. The trick lays in the fact that the player choosing a trade law can trade using that law only once in the game. However, whenever an opponent trade using his law, that player gets one of the resources that the trader gave up.

The game is interesting, though a little bit arid, with pasted on theme. It sums up to an equation where you try to optimize and enrich on other trades.

Maybe a little too chaotic with newbies, and a little too cerebral with experts player.

It took us longer to set up the game than to play. Update: It seems we were missing some cubes, as there were only 4 'extra' in the (3-player) game, and there should be 14?

A good filler/family game with an intriguing combination of deduction, bluffing, & strategy.

When strategizing there are clever conundrums.  For instance, assigning higher points to a potion you create and perhaps using the secret ingredient you want to promote, then reduces your ability to score higher points on subsequent turns. 

Although the components are generic, I always appreciate a pleasing look which this board has.  The rules are short and clear, so playing this game sporadically won't be an issue. 

The game can be a bit of a brain burner and the color confusion between the board's orange & yellow and the cubes that should match but don't, slows things down more.  If I can replace the cubes with closer matching colors I will most certainly do so.  The insert was designed for another game, not this one.

I don't like it as a two player game.  Better with 3 or more, although the more players, the less ability you have to plan.

Definitely want to play more although probably only modest play.

Trying to suss out each players' given preferred resource while concealing your own so players will consume it for you and create conversions for you to use without creating too powerful a resource conversion engine for any other player is intriguing. The decision space is surprisingly big for such a simple rule set and interactive without ever feeling targeted.

Nice abstract, fillerish game. Biggest negative is the downtime to put the game on the table and sort out the pieces. Different enough to stay in my collection.

This was an intriguing and interesting filler game. All my (so far) 3 plays took just over 30 minutes. I won all three due to a better understanding of the mechanism. There are a lot of difficult decision, not least how to force the other to get rid of "your secret colour", but also when to create a receipt or rasther coping an existing one.

Alchemist is a very curious game.

On the one hand, it has very few random elements. After the initial set up, everything in the game is dependent on the player's choices.

However, this game is very hard to read. The potion engines you set up are shockingly hard to predict over the long term.

The game looks intriguing and even obscure at first, but it is actually quite simple. Create a few recipes that should be interesting for other players, and copy other players' recipes that give you the most points or cubes you need for more copying, while trying to get rid of cubes of your secret color in the process and hoping your opponents help you. It is not too bad as filler, but it feels very dependent on luck and chaos, especially in relation to using up your secret color, which has a big impact on scoring.

Actually a very cool game with great ideas. The only real problem I have is, that the schools are the match-winner most of the times and you can't influence it that much. I don't know what I miss, but there's something rather small that keeps the game away from being really great.

Great for familys for sure.

RATING: 6
Truly original game that will surely not appeal to everybody.

DO NOT rate it after just 1 game.

My first play was tragic: boring, I didn't know what to do despite my best efforts, I couldn't grasp it completely, 'what the hell is this?' I was thinking constantly.

BUT the second game was much *much* better - somehow I started to understand how to play it, appreciate subtle nuances and plays, even PLAN something!  I felt I had some control over the flow of the game.  I realize that was just the beginnning of the process of learning to play this game really effectively, but that start was promising.

STILL - I don't intend to buy or suggest this, but at least I'm able to imagine myself playing it (something unthinkable after the first game).
There really MIGHT be something in this game.. (unfortunately I just don't especially desire to dig in and find out).

One major complaint (concerns a 4-player game) - winner is most likely to be decided accidentally.  The winner is in fact decided by the secret color (VPs from other sources exist, but are not decisive).  Whoever has the secret color with the least of number of cubes wins.  And this number is likely to be decided randomly - differences between best secret colors are 1-2 cubes so the luck (somebody puts one more or less cube of some color into some recipe) decides which color has the least cubes.

Initial Rating: 4.5 (February 2016)

A friend of mine bought this game thinking it was Alchemists (from CGE 2014) and was surprised to receive Alchemist (from Mayfair Games 2007). The mistake was hers so there wasn’t anything she could do but play the game :D.

The rules are pretty easy, you can explain them under 5 minutes. The game components and art are ok, but they aren’t anything out of the ordinary.

At first blush, it seems the game has obvious decisions, but after playing it a bit you realize Alchemist has a hidden layer of depth, however as the game is so simple I’m not sure I want to explore it further. To be clear, I feel the game is a family game not a strategy one. Sure it has some interesting decisions, but if players want to optimize their decisions the game will take a lot more time. It´s a better game when played from the gut. I found the gameplay to be very dull and mostly obvious. There is a lot of uncontrollable luck when you take cubes from the bag, enough to feel unbalanced but I need more plays to see if this is true. I also feel the first players have an unfair advantage.

I love that each player has a secret goal, I also like the decision of what tile to take when you make your potions, however, that’s not enough for me to like the game. 

Bottom line, an uninteresting game for me. Perhaps it could be a good game to introduce new people to our hobby, but I want meatier/heavier games. If we are going to play a filler there are scores of better games out there. Very boring. On the other hand, most players seemed to enjoy the game and a couple of them plan to try it with their families.

Seems like a cousin of Bazaar, where there must be some sort of weird algorithm to figure out the most efficient method.  It is one of the more unintuitive games I've played lately, though by the end of the game things become clear.

A game about creating spells, and then using already created spells to produce more ingredients. 

The Good: Presents a tough puzzle as to how to play because the strategy is not at all obvious. Plays short - I would say an hour. I would like to play again.

The Bad: First game is a learning game. Some may be turned off after their first game, as the game is so different and strategy not obvious. This one will definitely require multiple plays to figure out a good strategy.

RATING: 6.5
I'd certainly classify it as a nifty filler.  It's pretty innocuous.  In about 30 minutes you get some interesting choices, although it feels a tiny bit random (but really the only random thing is the initial cube draw).  I would like to try it with more players.  Worked okay with three players but probably much better with more. 

I'd consider this either a family game or a gateway game.  Probably a pretty good gateway at that because it explains in five minutes and plays in about 20-30.

I had an opportunity to play this game at the inaugaural MittenCon07 with two Mayfair representatives and 2 others and found the game an enjoyable and quick play.  Everyone is given a different tile with a different ingrediant (represented by colored cubes) in which one seeks to innoculously cause others to use the most (which results in a potentially significant scoring bonus at the end of the game).  Your turn consists of either creating potions of different cube(s) with each assigned a value from 1 to 10, copying one of the available potions that you didn't create earlier, picking two random cubes from the bag, or selecting a cube of your choice from the bank.  When creating a potion, one scores according to the value they assigned to the potion, rememberting that as the creator, you will be unable to use that potion again although everyone else will be able to copy that potion as often as they wish for the assigned value.  However, the owner of the potion will be given a cube from the recipe by the person who copies their potion each time.  As well, at the end of the game, each player scores a point for every two cubes they have left in their supply, rounding up.

Odd game in which one designs recipes to gain ingredients for other recipes and to score points.  The difficulty arises in that one can only return to score others' recipes multiple times.  There is also a hidden element in which one is trying to run a specific resource low in order to receive and endgame bonus.  I have only played online at Yucata so far.  The game is radically different when played with two or multiplayer and strategies are almost the inverse of one another.

A quite underrated title. Most people seemingly can't grasp the strange rules where you start the game with an almost overwhelming freedom of choice (achieved with very simple rules) and then realize how your initial choices echo throughout the game. There seems to be a multitude of winning strategies but they all rely mostly on you knowing or foreseeing your fellow players' behavior. Given the low price (at least on the Essen Fair 2007), nice layout, simple but clever rules I think this is a worthy addition to any game collection. It reminds me of the olden days when games were simple but fun, clever and effective.

I recently had a chance to demo this game at INDY GenCon. And even though it was only a demo I have to say I was thoroughly impressed. The game is heavily dependent on resources management, so you really have to pay attention to what you use, and what you%u2019ll receive for the outcome. I came in second place, mainly because I was focusing more on my, alternate goal, rather than creating potions and gaining points. It was a close game. I was defeated by a mere one point, but that%u2019ll do you in. 

Overall I had really no other choice but to give this game 10. Play for yourself, and you%u2019ll understand why.

Lackluster game that has players creating potions (a combination of ingredients).  What works is that the players determine what ingredients the potions require, what ingredients the potion creates (depending on what's available on the board) and then assign a point chip for that potion (1-10 points depending on what chips are available).  Players who can fill that potion receive points and the 2 ingredients created by the potion but then must give one of the ingredients used to make the potion to the potion creator.  I think the addition of "schools" where players have a hidden ingredient and score points at the end of the game depending on which school got rid of the most ingredients helps the game out immensely.  Unfortunately the game is purely economic as the potions don't really do anything special making for a fairly dry experience.

This is the 2007 game and is about making potions which score you points when you make it but scores others points when they copy it. Potion components are coloured cubes drawn randomly from a bag at game start and passed between players on making potions and also ejected from the game.

This is a great little filler game with tons of strategy.  From what I can see after it's original play, is it takes at least 3 moves to get your cubes off the board.  So I feel your best bet is to just collect cubes and crank out the most costly potions you possibly can.

RATING: 9
Alchemist is certainly underrated - which other game lets you decide how much to score and at the same time open a path for the other players to score?

The decisions are seemingly easy - create a potion from ingredients to score (and allow other players to score multiple times), copy another player's potion (and give that player ingredients) or take new ingredients. But as you can tell from the description, each decision must be balanced against its effect on other players. Add to that the secret ingredient of each player that will earn that player more points if the ingredient is the most used. The result of this potion is a very tense game that with simple mechanisms conveys the feeling the old alchemist must have felt.

Each player is a wizard attempting to make potions. You can make potions or copy potions. A potion consists of 1-5 cubes (5 available different colors) that gives a number of VPs and 2 cubes. Once you make a potion, you select an available VP token (ranging from 1-10), and opponents can copy that potion to earn that many VPs. You cannot copy your own potion, though. Each player is also dealt a secret ingredient counter, where whoever has the most of that ingredient used, they earn a bonus at the end of the game.

We tried to play this game with two players, but it was easy to guess each other's secret ingredient, and there wasn't much interaction. I would be happy to try with more players.

Downgraded from an 8 to a 7 after a conversation at my last game of Alchemist: "So how do you win this game?" "I... don't know..."  I want to like this game more, but it's hard to come up with a generally effective strategy or tactic for winning.  I do like the psychological aspect of trying to figure out which color other players are trying to use up, however.

Put out a combination of 5 tiles (in three colours) and allocate a VP total to it between 1 and 10. Earn those one-off VP's. Or copy the exact 5 tile combination that someone's created beforehand and earn the VPs they assigned to it. Try and do this many times. If you can't, draw a tile each turn in the colours you need until you can. This is probably a game that rewards those who can sit and analyse sequences of colour tile collections and the exchanges needed to eke out optimal scoring in minimum turns. Everyone else will have died of boredom before then because there otherwise seems little interesting to think about and it certainly doesn't want to make you care about doing well, being totally abstract and with turns so bland. Oh, and fun left a long time before the box was packed.

A great game with great design. It looks really cool and has good components. The game flow is very unconventional, and also, players decide on the value of each of their new recepies, which is very interesting and also a very hard decision. Unfortunately this game has been overlooked by the community, which is a pitty, since it's a really great game that doesn't take too long to play.

- The rules are well structured and the game is easily and quickly explained. But it does need at least one test play for players to get used to the unorthodox game flow.

A nice concept that feels somehow different. I am still not sure whether this game can be planned, somehow it does feel like you have little influence on the outcome. It definitly has a learning curve. We liked it alot, when we played it.

RATING: 6.5
A nice game that is easy to teach and fun to play. The problem is that at the start you have so many options, yet not sure what to do with them. As the game progresses, you realize what you should have done, but it is a little late to do anything about it. About half way through, you need to stop and really look at the board to see what your best bet is. You must think several turns ahead. Definitely worth a try, yet may turn some people off due to the slight backwards play. However, I do enjoy it and will be playing it regularly since it plays in only 30 to 40 minutes.

This is a very simple game about inventing formulae and trying to get the other players to use them.  Since extra ingredients are worth points at the end, the whole process of converting them using the proposed formulae is pretty calculable.  The only really interesting part is trying to run the game out of your secret ingredient at the end.  Overall, I'd describe the game as bland or even mindless.

Definitely a game which needs one play to get the idea what are the best ways to play the game. Because you usually set too high a value to your potions and an opponents gets some easy points by copying it.

Even though the components are boring wooden cubes, I like the idea of potion-making game. 
The gaming experience wasn't very positive after all, there were a lot of guessing - and the scoring? Doesn't work.

The jury is still out on this one.  Rating after 2 plays, one 2er and one 5er, I think it's most definitely a 3er or 4er game.  It's quite unique and original, but I'm not sure it really "worked".  The beginning is quite interesting as players create the potions and set a value for that potion, then gameplay gets quite repetitive.  You need to play this twice before you figure out what's going on.

(Comments after a single 2p game)

= 2016-02-20

I think this is my first game where the economy was almost completely controlled by the players. If you want an ingredient, the best way to get it is to have someone give it to you as payment. To get someone to give you what you want, you have to create incentives.

We only played an "exploration" game where we tried a few things (potions that seem too expensive; potions that are clearly too cheap) to see how it affected the game. As the person who created the "too cheap" potion, it's no wonder that I lost by a good margin, but it was really neat to see my decision impact the game's economy so much.

As a 2-player game, it might be too zero-sum and despite enjoying the game quite a bit, I don't know that I feel any urge to play it again. For such a clever design, it makes me sad that it may be a one-and-done.

Invent potions for one-off points or copy others as many times as you like for points.
Each player has a hidden identty 'school' of magic. Try to get your 'school' coloured  cubes to be the most used in order to gain bonus points at the end.

OK to play but hasn't 'wowed' me.

I played this game once at GenCon 2007. It's not a bad little game. In the one play that I had, I felt that it was a little difficult to figure out how to design a good strategy: creating recipes for things you wanted seemed not to be the way to do it. 

Generally speaking, it is simple enough that anyone can contribute on a first play, but it's not immediately obvious what a winning strategy is. This can be frustrating to a new player. On the other hand, I suspect it has quite an appeal if one plays it several times (which may lead to a different issue when experienced players meet new players).

On the other hand, the play is unique. I'd likely be up for another game.

I quite liked this after first game. Plays fast and has a unique mechanism where you create a potion and decide what's it worth yourself.

It might get quite interesting after everybody knows how to play the game.

OK. So I played it 6 times already and I can cast some more light on secrets that lie behind simple understanding of this game. Today I made my strategy work, but I missed one part of it.

Wow! This was dull. Abstract colour matching dullness. So dull that the colours might as well all have been grey. Just because a game mechanic is a little different doesn't mean you should actually publish the game! This one would have been better off left on the development table for a little longer to introduce something that wasn't so... dull. Why would someone publish this? Who was their target audience? Alchemists? Alchemy doesn't have to be this dull. An explosion or two would have been nice. It certainly might have woken me up, but even that is doubtful.

Found at Mayfair sales rack for $6 at Gen Con 2015. Great bargain and a lot of fun! Not sure how it is rated at less than a 6 overall and can't wait to let the kids try it out. It's easy to learn and definitely has strategy. Minimal luck and deduction makes it more interesting for hardcore gamers = easy entry level but enough strategy and planning for all.

Way underrated! .... and it was sold out at the Mayfair sales rack by the next day.

Really, this is all about creating an equation as you go.  It takes some of the concepts from Bazaar and turns it into a more actively manipulated system. I believe though that unbeknownst to players they are determining who will win the game far before it is realized.  With more experience you can see how each of these formulas interact with each other and I'm sure that it will be more rewarding, but I feel that the likelihood of only playing this with well-worn veterans is pretty unlikely.  

As an experience it is fun to see it play out, but I am a little hesitant to buy into this system.  I'm having a hard time believing that my brain can actually make enough proper decisions to parry against the permutations of other people's formulas.  We will see.  

Still, I think this rating could in fact go up.

Within the 200-plus different games that I've played, I can't think of one similar to Alchemist. It's not the greatest game but it's one that makes you calculate and think in a different way. It's has some market manipulation elements, a pinch of bluff and a whole lot of cubes. The theme is thin but I can't think of one that would suit the game better.

Fun game because it's so different. 

I bought it because it's from the designer that made Hab & Gut(Carlo A. Rossi) and I will watch for his next releases.

The board shows 10 cauldrons, each of which produce 2 different ingredients (cubes). Players have a random mix of 12 ingredients behind their shield. There's also a pool of 12 ingredients in a bag, and a bunch in supply. At start of game, get a random card showing one of the ingredients (different for each player; hidden). On your turn you either:
- take 1 cube from supply
- take 2 random cubes from the bag (till they're gone)
- create a new potion. When creating a new potion, you use one of the free cauldrons (if any): put your ingredients (no more than 2 of any color) in the spaces and choose one of the chits (1-10) to place on that cauldron. Mark that potion with one of your 5 markers. You get the 2 ingredients shown on the board and VP equal to the # on the chit you chose.
- copy an old potion. You may copy any potion on the board EXCEPT your own. You give one of the ingredients to the potion owner, and remove the rest from the game. You also get the ingredients that the potion makes, and the VP from the chit (1-10) shown on the board.

The game ends when 2 ingredients are left in supply. Then everyone reveals their hidden ingredients: get 1 VP for every 2 cubes. Then return all these cubes to supply. The ingredients are ranked by rarity and are worth VP (depending on rarity) to the players who have those cards (from the beginning of the game). Most VP wins.

---
It's an interesting game mechanism, where you have to think about combinations of cubes to use to make potions to get new cubes so you can make new potions. Very much like Bazaar, except that the players get to make the recipes, which are now fixed and worth specific VP values. However, a bad pull at the beginning can mess up your game (e.g., I drew more than half gray: most others didn't have gray so they didn't make potions that use gray while I had to; I got more and more gray the entire game!). Also, the end VP reward felt a bit random -- you have some control, but the VP reward seemed to be too high. I would try the game again, but only because it does play pretty quickly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
It's not a bad game but it has very dry decisions to make. I didn't like the final bonus scoring of the clour that was the most used during the game scoring a bunch of points. That amount of points seemed too much for the total score thus making the game totally uncontrolled.

07 JUL 2009 - After 1 game, I found the game....intriguing. I totally got one aspect of the goals wrong (i.e. what it meant to have the 'most popular' ingredient), but still found the mechanics interesting. Within the structure of the game, you are essentially defining the specific rules of the game while you're playing. Because of this, it's difficult to wrap your head around it or even form a specific opinion of the game. This calls for more plays to really understand the game....

Has some of the same color equations of [gameid=287], but has enough tweaks to feel like its own game.  Building individual recipes gives players more control of what is spent, and having your own special ingredient adds an element of deception that is fun as well.  I guess both [gameid=287] and [gameid=27385] have a place in my collection, as [gameid=27385] adds some randomness that is preferable with some groups and undesired by others.  Components are nice enough, with a creepy hand on the board for atmosphere.

Clever, simple game where players literally define the moves that other players can make. You want to offer moves that benefit you, but are good enough that others are willing to take anyway.

I wouldn't want to play with the screens, though. Hidden information turns this into a deduction game. I don't think it lasts long enough for that.

With open possessions you have a complicated set of implications to try to think through. But the game is mechanically very simple. It's a fascinating piece of work.

...So, this is an economic game in a similar vein to Container. There are five good types, and ten possible conversions you can make (i.e. each unique selection of two different goods). The first player to make a given conversion defines its parameters (what goods it requires and how many VP it scores) and then can never, himself, use it again.

Adding initial direction to the game are two things: 1. Each player has a specific good that they want to see spent as much as possible, and 2. Everyone starts with a random draw of 12 goods. (The bonus for the former is fairly minor in comparison to other VPs one will earn, but it could decide a close game.)

Gioco piatto e lineare, quasi matematico in cui copiando le pozioni degli avversari si cerca di ottenere punti cercando nello stesso tempo di crearne di difficili da copiare per gli altri.

Nicely distilled game that has reduced the game-play down to the what it needs to be. This results in a fast-paced and interesting game without the bloat.

This is a weird game. Half interesting, half boring, 100% unique. I'm glad I've tried a game that redefines pushing wooden cubes around. Still, I don't intend to play it any more. This is because after players set up the recipes the game starts playing itself without player particpation.

A good, if not spectacular game.  Teaches and plays easily.  Has a bit of the flavor of Bazaar, without the mind numbing parts of that game.

A nice filler.  Plays well with a wide range of players.  Not a ton of strategy, but I like it.


Update
Definitely hasn't really survived the times very well.  Playing it again a few years later, I find it dry and not that engaging.

Why this is not in the collection anymore: Very confusing at first and while eventually we figured this out, the cubes just didn't make this a game about alchemy that was wished for.

Intriguing little game. The idea is extremely simple, and feels kinda pasted on. But the actual gameplay gives many levels of strategy, which I find rather hard to comprehend. Good game!

I enjoyed my 4 player game. Trying to get others to get rid of your secret ingredient does not seem to be the only strategy. Getting others to make your potions and give you cubes is good also.

Played once (with 4 players). I wonder how much control there really is - I'm afraid it requires more thinking to get it than I am ready to put in it. I might give it another try, but I will not be actively looking for it unless someone convinces me I have missed something.

This game doesn't work at all. Consider a 5 player game:

Each player is secretly dealt one of the five colors. This process is actually irrelevant because when all players attempt to effectively maximize their position not only it is obvious who was dealt which color but also the winner will be determined by chaos and starting position. Each player is also dealt 12 cubes of random colors.

First player is now given the opportunity to play. As you will see sitting in one of the first three positions is incredibly broken with no associated drawback. First player designs a new recipe. Recipes supply players with cubes when other players make them, and it's a way to remove your color of cubes from the supply. The most desirable recipes are those that give the alchemist 8, 9, or 10 points. Let's say first player chooses 9 - it's more enticing than 8 and he can still build 10 when the next player designs it. He'll make the recipe two cubes of his color and two different off-color cubes. This way one cube of his color must always leave the supply when the recipe is built. (Most likely when a player creates the potion Gray Gray Blue Green they will give one of the grays to the designer to avoid putting two of what could be his color out of the game.) Designing a recipe with two of a color that is not one's own is suicidal. Assuming first player is Gray and makes a recipe that's Green Green Gray Blue, yes the same one gray gets removed each iteration, except when the player who is actually green chooses to build your recipe. This player will choose to give you the gray because he knows he is green and wants green to removed, and knows you're not blue because somebody else made a Blue Blue X recipe. So your recipe is less effective and it gives the game to the green player because he will also build a recipe that's Green Green X, and will have plenty of greens to funnel into your recipe where he can guaranteed remove two from the game. You can't make a recipe at 9 or 10 that's uses more or less cubes than four - nobody will build a recipe that costs five and three will give your opponents easy points while you'll get stuck with too many gray cubes and no outlet.

As you've probably expected, second player should do the exact same thing with 10 while third and fourth should design 7 and 8 with two cubes of his color and one off-color cube. Last player is shit out of luck. 6 is undesirable when it costs 3 cubes so the recipe must cost 2. It will also be obvious which color is his so if his recipe consists of one of his color and one not, players will usually give him his color back, meaning fewer of his color cubes are removed from the game. So the recipe must cost two of his own color.

After this blatantly automatic first turn the game is entirely random. Depending on what cubes players are dealt and which recipes happen to feature slightly more of one color than another determines the game. Players will basically bounce between the recipes worth 8-10, settling for 6-7 only if necessary. If second player shafts first player by designing his recipe to use none of the cubes of his color and requiring the two colors that are produced by his recipe, first player might attempt something techy like a 5 point recipe the requires one cube of the double color of second player's recipe. Long story short, I don't care to play this monotonous, more or less solved borefest again to find out if it would actually work.

Damn is the color mix-up of the components frickin' annoying! The board should have yellow spaces to match the yellow wooden cubes, but the board spaces are orange instead. This is compounded by the fact that the orange board spaces are red, and there are not even any red wooden cubes in the game.

So I bought some red wooden cubes to replace the now totally worthless yellow ones with. Did this make the game easily playable?

Nope, unfortunately not.

The color issue doesn't end there, have a look at the stupid Player Screens, which are supposed to display each player's color; they totally screwed them up as well. The white is grey, the brown and black impossible to spot - one looks blue, and the purple looks at best a deep wine red. The only one you can recognize at a glance is red, which leads to another problem...

My solution to exchange the yellow wooden cubes with red ones, now leads to issues if the red wooden player discs are used. Since he has the only screen that actually matches his color, I'm so damn fed up I'd like a refund!

Oh, and one of the secret school ingredient tiles totally ripped on the back, so you can always tell it apart from the others - again leaving my copy even more unplayable. Damn, I dislike this game, and haven't even tried it with a full table of 4-5 players, which is when it's supposedly at its best.

This is the first time that Colin from ObsessedWithGaming.com has disappointed me. His video review made me buy the game, but I think the component issue is so bad that it's nigh unplayable as is.


[b]EDIT:[/b]
Okay, the color mistakes are horrible, but with some new cubes the game is fun. It's a quick game and still quite think-y. It is definitely a strategy game, and figuring out how to get your secret ingredient used up is a fun puzzle, and with a good strategy absolutely possible to manage.

This is a great and meaty filler.

At the end of the game the cubes are spread over 5 different places:

1) Behind the Players' Screens
2) The Reserve Pile
3) The Oracle Bag
4) The Compendium (that is, the game board)
5) The Discard Pile

You score a Fame Point bonus for having the least cubes left in a few categories, but which categories differs by version.

Board Game = least cubes of categories 1-2 (or most of 3-5)
Yucata = least cubes of categories 1-3 (or most of 1-2)

I purchased this game in the hopes that it would be fun, light and somewhat strategic.  I like the theme and the components are certainly eye-catching!

I was pleasantly surprised that this game offered a gaming experience unlike anything else I have played!  To me, this is very difficult to do as I have played a good amount of games.  

The game play is a loads of fun!  I have played this dozens of times and others have asked to play a session or two on multiple occasions.  As I mentioned, the game play is relatively unique - the collection, distribution and turn-over of ingredients always keeps the players guessing and adds to the game experience.

The components are excellent.  They feature some pretty attractive artwork and play into the theme nicely.  The ingredient cubes are very nice and so are the rest of the chits.  The game board is especially worth mentioning as it is stunning, highly detailed and extremely thematic!

I recommend this game to anyone who finds the theme alluring and wants a light strategy, abstract and fun game!

It's rather interesting how your choices affect you indirectly.  This game keeps me itching to play it again, so I can see exactly how its bizarre, slippery mechanisms will work when I twist it this way and that.

After 1 Play: This has got to one of the weirdest, most unintuitive games I've ever played.  After reading the rules I wasn't sure there was really a game here.  After playing once I'm pretty sure there is, but I can't tell whether it works or not.  I'd enjoy at least one more play of this, and I think my rating could change dramatically (in either direction).

I actually like this game, its not particularly challenging, and is relatively short , we usually play in about 30 - 40 mins.

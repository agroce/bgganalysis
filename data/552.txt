Perfect info game requiring lots of pre-figuring. Excessively tight play with five. Might be fun with three. Many best moves are dictated, eg get another bus or get start player so you can get another bus. Strong start player advantage, as they get the extra bus on the first turn for one action, they don't have to spend an action on start player first. 

This might be looser and more fun if start player rotated automatically and the initial last player got some compensation. Another possibility is if the time of day were rolled randomly each turn instead of being predictable/manipulatable; hard to guess whether the roll should be made befor the "Vrrooem" phase or at the start of the turn.

Wow, this game manages to pack in a lot of worker placement, route building, timing consideration, and pick up and deliver "goodness" in such a modest, short package (60 minutes).  Count me as impressed with Bus, ostensibly the first worker placement game from 1999.  The game also features a very interesting pacing issue:  how fast should I play my limited actions?  

Our first game was played with the Metro PNP board which seemed nice enough to me, and in our first game, no one chose the "stop time" option, which I must admit, seems like a very strange mechanic to put in a game, though obviously, that option presents major screwage potential.

Very good.  Plays easily in about one hour.  Moving passengers is obviously key,  but it looks like there are several other things to get sorted first, so I'd really like to try again to try some new strategy.

Played a home-brewed copy. Was much lighter than I expected. The idea that there is strict limit on the total number of action you can take is interesting, but I think I would want it in a somewhat lighter game.

RATING: 5
I really wanted to love this game. It's got a good concept, which is not yet overdone in board games. It's got a great mechanic (the use of the action stones as a limited resource is just brilliant). Furthermore, even when the manual tries to make it seem a very difficult game, it's quite easy to learn.

Sadly, it actually becomes a very chaotic experience. The fact that the actions are resolved in a weird order (some favor the first one there, while some punish that player) make for an experience where you heavily depend on what others want to do. And not in a good way, mind you.

I love games with tight resources, but for such a game to be successful, it needs to give the player some sort of "protection" against the actions of other players. This can take the form of preventing harm done to you with clever play, or just the fact that you can score in multiple ways. In Bus, none of these elements are present... Once you become a target for someone else, there's little you can do for the rest of the round (unless you're willing to be left out of the game sooner than the other players).

It's a nice game, with an interesting concept. But not one I really want to play that often, due to it's highly chaotic nature in a game otherwise not very light.

could have been a very good game, but it isn't : the one time it is too fast over, the other time it is almost impossible to score. It's a pity, because the game promises more. But when you play the game and the endscore with 5 players is 2,2,1,0,0 on a table of 15 there's something wrong.

The first play was quite an interesting game.  I watched part of a game one week and was thoroughly befuddled.  The next week, I received the rules explanation before the game started and it really wasn't too hard to follow... just hard to make my bus line work.  Another play was pretty good.  Seems like once you get the rules it should be simple... it isn't simple, but it is clever.

Long, complex, brain-burner, fairly abstract.  Played once on SpielByWeb.  Hard to grasp gameplay from the rules, so read strategy tips in BGG forums before playing.  The game works best for experienced players since newbies cannot always comprehend the consequences of their actions.  You have only 20 precious action cubes for the entire game, and some will be wasted by mistakes or cut-throat play.  This results in many agonizing decisions... unfortunately individual players don't have a lot of control over the game... so you must count on other players to make good moves.

RATING: 7
Worker placement meets Pickup and Deliver. No idea why no one else has done this. It's a great game. Like TGZ, when we were finished, it felt like we had barely scratched the surface. There's definitely a need for players to work together to stop anyone from dominating. I suspect the strategies to this are deeper than they first appear.

Not a bad little game, I like the art as well.  The main problem with it is your first couple of turns every round are always the same, and are determined by the order of play.  There simply aren't any interesting decisions to make, it's all about optimization, and you're always making the most obvious choice.

I'm a sucker for pick up and deliver games, so it's no surprise I enjoy this one to some degree!  Pretty difficult decisions when it comes to choosing actions, as you definitely don't want to waste and action!  In the end, it's nothing earth-shattering, but is very enjoyable if you like optimizing and pick-up and deliver.

The main drawback is the drawback that so many Splotter Games tend to have.  They start out great and move along at a good clip, but then the games build up and build up until the game slows down to a crawl while people consider all of the options.  This is especially true with Bus as potential kingmaker situations can arise, which really detracts from the fun up until that point.

RATING: 6
The theme is great. The game's place in history as the first worker placement game makes it interesting to play. The sheer importance of getting extra busses as quickly as possible, makes the game feel largely predictable in how it will play out initially.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
its ok, but wow the fiddly rules with how bus level changes the action spots in such a non-intuitive way.  Also, restricting the building placement by category feels really bad at times. I do like how you get a certain number of actions for the game and choosing when to use them is unique, but the flaws don't make up for that.

A single play of this was enough to let me know the theme was wack. Time stops? Now if the game was great it might become a cult classic. Instead I fear this will be yard sale material for decades to come.

RATING: 7.5
Don't play with more than three players.  The complaints over the time control action are over-stated (unless you play with more than three players).  

Concern: I seem to enjoy this one more in retrospect than I do in play.

Update:  No, the (3 player) game is in fact that good.  I don't think I'd play it with any other player count.  It is also mean, conniving, cutthroat and all sorts of other good things.  My only complaint is that it seems to end a little too soon as there is too much advantage to driving the game to a fast/early close.

Update: Rating raised a point for newly exposed subtlety in road and building construction.

With 4 or 5 players this is a very good game.  With 3 players, it's not so good.  I don't like the way the action stones work out in a 3-player game.  If two players go crazy with the action stones, then the third player has no choice but to join in (as opposed to holding back on the action stones for later, higher-scoring rounds) because the game will end when the two speedsters run out of stones.

A charming and mean worker placement game that feels both incredibly tight and totally open.  Players have lots of opportunities for clever play in this early Splotter.

With more plays, it may top Caylus as my favorite worker placement game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
I had fun playing this. Reminds me a lot of Caylus. There are usually 3 or 4 things you want to do at any given time, but you can only pick one. It's a real brain burner. Timing and logistical planning are crucial. We played with 5 which made it too chaotic for me, but I still felt I had meaningful decisions to make. If I am to play this game again, I'd play with 4 and possibly tweak or get rid of the time freezing action - It adds too much unnecessary tension and arbitrariness to a game which is otherwise mostly predictable. I have the same complaint about the provost movement in Caylus. 

(Rating : a 6 or 7 maybe? I like brain burners)

I really like this game but it is so damn ugly. I think with good components and a less offensive looking board, I'd probably get it. I like the action selection and the reverse order in carrying them out. Its cagey.

I was recommended this game by fellow GCL Meatball Nate based on my previous experiences with Splotter games. It took me and my gaming partners a little while to wrap our heads around the game, especially when it came to player turn order effects and even more importantly, the clock. But once we did, we found the game a nice, lightweight introduction to Splotter's hallmark characteristics network building and pick-up-and-deliver over said network. That idea has been distilled down to its essence in Bus and as such provides a good litmus test to see whether you like this kind of pattern. If you do, you have my sympathies, for you will want to try out other Splotter games too, then. Don't be fooled by its age: this is a timeless design which works rather nicely.

Although, that said, I am not really fond of that clock. I understand why it is there, but if players are not careful the game can be over and done with in a single action. The [i]gote[/i] the other players can be put in can be so great that it is really pointless to continue. There are a few prerequisites for such a situation to arise, and likely with growing experience players will learn to recognise the warning signs and take small but appropriate steps to steer the game away from the precipe. But still compared the good-natured pestering and blocking of the rest of Bus, the clock can feel like a [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKlnMwuCZso]Metal Storm gun operating at full speed[/url]. Boom. No escape, no quarter, no [i]But I wanted...![/i]'s, simply game death in a simple and sleek package. It is only this aspect (as well as the unpleasant artwork, but then again I'm a big fan of abstraction) that sours me somewhat on this game at the moment.

A rather surprising development was also that at first it took me a while to locate someone with a copy of the game who was willing to lend it to me. It was later established that someone I know and play fairly regularly with in local circles owned a copy himself but never played it. So the game will probably see further plays in the future.

Oh, my head.

1/3 of the way into my one play of this, it shifted from a "get people where they want to go" game to a "get people *away* from where they'll want to go next turn" game.

Painful, interesting, tense, and looks like it can play out wildly differently depending on player choices.

Excellent designed board with all the game references and it's quite amusing to plan a decent network to move multiple passengers to various locations.  I'm favouring 3-4 players rather than 5 because of the issue with only 1 bus being available each round (maybe there should be 2 bus slots in a 5p game).

Was interesting, but failed to properly engage me. I want to play it again to see if there is more to it than I initially saw, but as it stands it feels like a very standard, lighter euro. As my preference is on the heavy end of the spectrum, this reduces its appeal to me, unfortunately.

RATING: 6
Players grow and run a bus network, trying to get as many passengers to destinations as possible.  Players play rounds where they alternate playing "action cubes" onto a chart.  The actions represented are expand bus route, add a bus, add passengers, add destinations, freeze time, become start players.  One of those games where you want to do several things at once but can only do one of them.  Your cubes are a game limit, so once they're gone, that's it for you.  When buses are run, players earn points per passenger delivered to a destination.  Clever, fast (2-3 hours on the box?  We played in 45 minutes).  Worth a look.

Good no-luck planning game, a clear ancestor of Caylus (particularly the action-choosing mechanic, and the clock feels a little like the provost).  Seems a little too chaotic with 5, but I had more of a handle on predicting what was going to happen with 4.  The board is also a bit too cluttered, although the artwork is charming.

Components: standard for a Splotter game :)
Complex: easy rules, tough gameplay
Weight: medium
Players: 3 or 4
Length: less than 90 mins
Mechanics: workers placement and route building
Decisions: lot of, where to expand, stop the clock, which actions to take...
Opinion: with quite easy rules you find a very clever game with lot of tension and hard decisions. With a worker placement mechanic you have to create your bus network and move the citizens to the place they want to go.
First of all the worker placement, you have your workers, but they are a limited number for the entire game, once you finish your 20 workers... the game is over for you. To do this you have to place a minimum of 2 per round, but you can place any amount you want.
Then you have all the decisions what to do with them, expand your network, bring more citizens, build buildings, increase your fleet...
Because each round they would like to go to a different place, and in a logical order... to the office in the morning, to the pub after the work is finished and then rest at home. Here you have the option to stop the clock, so they stay in the same place. On one hand this is a nice mechanic to play with the game, for a minus one you can mess the plans of everybody, on the otehr hand, it sounds weird thematically.
Overall, not the best Splotter for me, but this is a game bringin lot of options, tension on the board and played in around 60 mins when everybody know the rules. LOVE IT!!

Fun but ultimately sort of frustrating.  The cube management aspect of the game is probably its best mechanic.  I question the helpfulness of the time-stop-option.  It seems to degrade the game a little and certainly slows down the scoring.  The first few turns seem too luck based as you get screwed by what others are doing.  Later turns seem to be a bit of a mathfest and the winner can sometimes be predicted several turns in advance.  The wildcards are the losing players who get to play kingmaker.  Nice looking game though, and I think with more plays I would like it more.

RATING: 8
Bus might be one of the earliest instances of worker placement, but goddamn, it does so with purpose. You are actually getting in line for something. And like with most scarce goods and services, getting in line doesn't guarantee service! What's more, throw in a little pick-up-and-deliver in which you build the routes (as well as the city in which the routes are made), and things get nasty quick. Friendly games can score high, but mean games can score *so* low ("looks like that passenger you were planning on sending across town to the pub had a pub built over night in front of his office; too bad!").

Cole Werhle's redesign is also topnotch and makes for a gorgeous package.

[Initial Impression: 6]
An interesting route-building and delivery game that requires intense planning and some cut-throat blocking moves. The basic idea is to score points by moving passengers along your bus routes from home to work to after-hour bars. Each passenger can only be moved once per turn, and only moves if there is no location of the desired type already at the passenger's current stop. Each turn is governed by a series of actions: build routes, improve your bus capacity, add new passengers to the board, add new locations to the board, stop time, and change first player. The way that each action is chosen, alloted, and carried out is a bit wonky at first (sometimes the first to choose is the last to act but gets the largest allotment...), but you get used to it by mid-game. Stopping time is a psychedelic but strategic action which costs one point, but may stop all the other players from scoring (because all the passengers remain at their current locations). Careful use of this action is clearly a key point. You're limited to a fixed number of actions for the entire game, so be sure to use them wisely to set yourself up and make sure that you'll have an opportunity to score at least as often as the other players. An early lead can be gained by using up actions more quickly, but you'll likely be left watching as the others surpass you later. Overall, I didn't find it to be a huge amount of fun, and some of the strategic options seem quite limited (for instance, only one person can improve their bus line per turn, so this is often the first action taken).

a mean, brain splitting game.  Has some really interesting ideas and is themed very well.  But make no mistake, this one is where you work to steal points from other players, and manuever to make it so.

After a couple of plays, I just don't seem to get it, and the scores are so brutal, I don't know if it's enjoyable.

RATING: 5
I'm torn on how to rate this game - I admire it for having some very innovative elements for its time.  This game was worker placement before worker placement was in.  The time stoppage shakes the game out of its otherwise predictable rhythm.

On the other hand, it is a route connecting game, which I generally loathe.  It also takes some time to think through the correct move because of all the possible passenger moves, so there's more downtime than I'd like.  I have a very short attention span so I would prefer to think and play quickly; Bus encourages and even requires analysis paralysis.  Though I think Bus is a fine achievement in game design I don't want to play it again, so I have to rate it on that basis.

RATING: 8
Bus is - get this - a 10-year old worker placement route connecting reverse turn order game. "Action Drafting" is probably more accurate here, since thematically you aren't sending workers (or anyone for that matter) to claim your actions, but the mechanic is unmistakable.

The game is set in the very strange city of Bus. There are only three times in the city of Bus: Work-o-clock, Bar-o-Clock, and Home-o-Clock. When the clock changes, the city's inhabitants leave their current location in search of something more temporally appropriate. The object of the game is to get points by "Vrooming" passengers along your Bus lines. To do this, you must build a network, acquire buses, place new citizens on the board, and build new locations. Occasionally you might go see the reigning Mad Scientist of Bus and ask him to stop time. Sounding cool? It gets better. You have exactly 20 actions to do all of this. You have to spend at least 2 actions on your turn, but in theory you can take as many as are available. The only catch is, if you run out of actions, more measured and conservative players still have turns left, and unless you've been careful, they will catch and surpass you. But wait, there's more. Bus has a reverse turn order mechanic reminiscent of Power Grid. Except that it's older than Power Grid, of course. It's pretty much older than any game it might remind you of. Some actions in Bus are drafted left-to-right. Some are drafted right-to-left. But all are taken left to right, which means that the first person to claim an action might be going last. As you've noticed by now, this isn't your typical worker placement where you claim an action and only you get it. Instead, if you claim an action early you might get the best version of the action or you might get to go first, etc. Lots and lots to consider.

This may turn out to be strictly a 3-player game. Also, until you obtain your third Bus, I think only 1/3 of your opening moves are unscripted (claim first, buy bus, free move, repeat).

The rules to this are a bit confusing, and I don't think its a game one learns in one or two playings, as there is a lot of strategy.  That being said, the choices of actions, the limited resources, the dependence on how many buses the top person have all combine to make this a fascinating game.  I'd like to see it expanded to different maps.

RATING: 7
This is right up my alley - simple rules but heavy game play. The average game weight ranking on this site must be a joke. Order of actions is so crucial in this pick-up-and-deliver game that action selection is painful. If done casually you're probably not competing. The flexible number of actions per round is a wonderful mechanic that allows risky play. Very nice integration of board, components and theme (love the Dutch passengers.) But watch out for AP problems. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Very interesting game with some unique mechanisms, like the limiting factor for action selection (i.e. the "highest number of buses" determines how many people can perform a specific action).  One needs to plan carefully for the future.  I can see how this would be very difficult with the full complement of players, but also more interesting.  Wondefully illustrated board full of references to other games.  I think I would appreciate this game more with further play.

Traded away.

I was not sure what to expect from this one, but it was actually a very fun and enjoyable logistics game. Involves as much offensive as defensive. Our total scores end up being relatively low. Bus capacity is key so you can't fall too far behind. Stopping time could be an important tool that is overlooked but when combined with good planning it could be used effectively. Another Splotter hit for me.

RATING: 7
Early Splotter game in which one seeks to generate an efficient passenger bus service.  There is great potential for serius cut-throat play in this game as you can choose an action which may give you a great quantity of that action but may also mean you go last in that phase and actually take no action!  Each person has 21 cubes of which one is placed initially in the parking lot indicating everyone has one bus.  This leaves each person with only 20 actions maximum in the game which can be less if someone uses all their actions before you can efficiently use yours.  You must choose at least 2 actions per turn, but may choose to do more if you wish BUT this does mean less actions later.  Actions chosen occur in the following order: lay road, purchase a bus, bring in passengers to one of two train stations, purchase building(s), control time warp, scoring, and first player.  Only one player can choose to purchase a bus, control time, and choose first player each round.

My rating here is provisional and based only on a single play online at SBW.  I feel that I would have a better overall feel for the game if I had played face-to-face first.  Hopefully, I will have the opportunity to play over the board with an experienced teacher.  My rating may well improve.

An interesting early worker placement game, but ultimately not a winner for me.  I will say, I don't much care for games with a non-random setup, so even putting out 3-4 random starting buildings would make it more intriguing.  I really liked the game pacing mechanisms, both the 20 max actions and the freezing of time stones.  I also appreciate that this game was one of the first worker placement games and has design elements used in later created games.  However, I am left wanting to play Steam, as it feels a bit like that but without the random city cubes to start the game!

----------

Although scoffed at by fans of Bus on the forums, a variant of this sort would make the game much better for me, probably raising my rating to 7 or 8:

"Before turn 1, randomly distribute buildings face down on all of the "A" spaces, turning them face up immediately after all have been placed. Before turn 2, do the same for the B spaces, before turn 3, the C spaces and before turn 4, the D spaces."

I don't think I would fill the board.  My idea is to seed the game with 8 tiles on A (one on each of the double corner spaces) and 4 tiles on B (again, one on each of the double corners).

An action drafting game that actually deals (and quite blatantly so) with the point of a draft: prioritization.

It might also be the most interactive worker placement title out there. Every move directly impacts every other player's incentive structure. 

This is a game about forcing your opponents into bad decisions, while avoiding overcommittal of your very scarce resources. Really well done.

This is a really good, near timeless design. The margin for error in the action draft is agonizingly thin.

A network building pick up & deliver game which to me feels somewhat overly complex and drawn out. Paris Paris achieves a similar game feel and doesn't overstay it's welcome.

Combination of action/role selection and pick-up-and-deliver, somewhat lacking in intensity but with a good amount of screwage and meanness to compensate.  Made me wish I was playing a game more tightly focused on one of those two mechanisms (action selection and pu&d, not screwage and meanness).  Not bad, but ultimately seems like a lot of fuss over a small handful of points, with one of the most nauseating boards ever produced.

Must have been a novelty when first released but by today's standards it's well below the average. Slow and fiddly with a killer downtime between turns. The gameplay is basically about building the game board which feels weird and so very dated.

I bought the game in part because of the goofy art.  If anyone needs confirmation that Dutch college students smoke a lot of pot, this is it.  The action point system is unlike those in Kramer games, and it works very well.  A little unintuitive, but once you figure it out, very elegant.  

[later] I've decided I don't like Bus's chaotic design.  I like the playful style, but its too busy for playability.  And some of the locations are not very close to their intersections.  Still, a good pick up and deliver game.  I'll play whenever my girlfriend requests it, which happens on occasion.

Played a number of times and still just scratching the surface of the strategy.  Or, we've seen it all and haven't realized it, yet.  But, the linear action selection track is a great mechanic.  A precursor to Caylus, in this regard, but unique in how it is executed.

A game of building bus routes and delivering passengers. Brute efficiency is the major requirement for doing well at this game.

This is a route building, pickup and deliver game by splotter, that has a somewhat similar feel to Food Chain Magnate, in that it's completely brutal and unforgiving of the smallest mistake. Each player gets a limited supply of action cubes, that when spent, are gone forever. Only one player having action cubes left is one of the endgame timers. You place cubes into an action board, which allows you to expand your route, deliver more people with a single action, place people who want to travel, place buildings for the people to travel to, move people, become first player, or halt the shifting of where the people want to go to. During the movement phase, the meeples will be available to travel if they aren't currently at an intersection where the place everyone wants to go to is. Not only that, but if a place like that is at their intersection, they take that place out of contention as well. This means that the places available and the meeples available to work with is surprisingly limited, and points are extremely tight. I found this game fascinating, and it did play a lot shorter than most Splotter games I've tried.

An excellent no-luck abstract playable at www.spielbyweb.com

Generally, I like a bit of luck in my games to keep them fresh.  Bus is unusual in that, despite having no variable elements (other than the players themselves), you don't get the feeling that you're just making the same moves over and over.

The goal of the game is to aquire points by delivering passengers from locations at which they don't want to be to locations at which they do want to be.  There are three "times of day": (1) morning, when passengers wish to go to work, (2) evening, when passengers wish to go to the pub, and (3) night, when passengers wish to go home.  You can set up scoring opportunities by expanding your bus lines (either length or # buses = # passengers transportable), placing buildings, adding more passengers into the mix and/or taking control of the clock (making it stop or preventing it from stopping).  To actually score points, you select the VROOM! action.  The challenge of the game comes from the fact that every player must take at least two actions per round *but* the number of each action available is limited by the number of buses.  Also, the later you choose an action, the less you get to do.  This can make for some really tough decisions.  In this game, timing really is everything.  If not, you might just miss the bus!

Despite the annoying artwork, I enjoyed this one.  As pick up and deliver games go this one was shorter than most, causing me to really enjoy the economy of actions each player has.  I found the ability to continue your actions in each turn to be a great mechanic...  making me wonder if a third action in any turn was worht depleting my finite actions.  I also enjoy that there is a possibility to screw your opponents if you have choosen your actions well.

If this one had better artwork, I would rate it higher.

I have to say, I really wasn't getting this game at first.  I could often see where I had made mistakes after the fact but since it was a first play never really felt like I could avoid such mistakes.  There is a lot going on in the game and for a game with no luck there is a lot of chaos basically because of the choices that other players make.

There is an amazing amount of conflict for a game based on buliding bus routes!  It is possible, with the placement of a single action cube to crush the plans of all your competitors given the right opportunity!  It will probably be a long time before I play this again and I'll have forgotten anything I learned this time.

Homemade copy.


The progenitor worker placement game. Bus is a curiosity more than an excellent game at this point, and it is much simpler compared to Splotter's bigger games, but it's still a fun game that has some interesting ideas even when compared to more modern designs.

The map is insane and amazing.

It's a nice journey until just before the very end when it's in danger of degenerating into a point counting, analysis paralysis, king making, whine fest. A modern day remake would probably throw in some hidden scoring, a joker action and hidden objectives to alleviate the drawn out endgame. But the journey along the way is an interesting worker placement affair. Fairly easy to dive into with simple enough rules. With only 20 actions per player it should take only an hour with experienced players. Should. The artwork on the board is interestingly different from what we're used to, but it needs to be backed up with building chits that stand out better on the board - because they don't and it's frustratingly annoying having to double check the board to make sure you haven't missed the chit that'll swing the game. Not bad, some nice ideas, but nothing special.

RATING: 5.5
Essentially a train game where players spend a limited pool of 20 action tokens throughout the game to build routes to score points by taking passengers (goods) to destinations. There are some interesting layers including the ability to 'stop time' in order to control what desinations are paying out that turn.

Cute but ultimately flawed as a player will run away if they manage to get an unshared route. The first player seems to also have an advantage but judicious planning will get around this.

An excellent, simple game. Unfortunately, it is possible to make it completely boring by simply laying a couple of decent routes, getting a point up on everyone, and then stopping the clock over and over. Definitely should be played with people who want everyone to have a good time, and not with folks who want to use you for their strategy experiment.

what an intriguing game!! i really enjoyed this. there are so many interesting things going on in this game that i just have to explore it more! it's network building, pick-up-and-deliver, and action drafting - one little mistake in your action prioritization can be crushing. and this is a mean little game, too—very interactive.

I enjoyed this logistcal game.  The 21 actions and action track are great mechanics.  The clock, however, is problematic.  If one player gets far enough ahead, they can do the clock and 1st player and run out the game.  I recommend the variant where the clock moves backwards instead of stops.

RATING: 7
Easier to play online (spielbyweb.com): less fiddly, more time to figure out the possibilities.

The game is actually pretty straightforward, although it may not seem like it at first glance. 
It's an old worker placement/action-selection/network-building/pick-up-and-deliver game with some interesting twists. You generally want to take only the 2 required actions each round, but sometimes you'll do better to take extra ones -- when is it worth it? Should you push the game to and end, or try to hold back taking your actions till later (when you have more buses and can score more VP)? Dealing with the uncertainty of the clock is fun, too -- is it worth the -1VP hit to stop time? If someone else chose that action, what type of building should I place or build towards? Where should I extend my network?

Just a few things I don't like...
- the almost-scripted first few turns where the starting player chooses the Bus action, and the 2nd player chooses Start Player so they can do the same next round. With limited actions you'd like to move the most people with each action, hence must have buses. So this would seem to be a standard move. However, maybe one can do well without following this lockstep pattern at the beginning?
- the fiddliness of moving the passengers on and off the building tiles every round. People with shaky hands should let someone else do it!
- the artwork is kinda busy!

Nevertheless, either played online or possibly played face-to-face at a reasonable pace, this is an interesting and early take on the worker-placement/action-selection idea, definitely worth trying.

--- Summary ---
The preliminary setup: the board shows a network of roads and intersections, with spaces labeled A-D (1 or 2 at an intersection) scattered about. 4 passengers start on the board, at the 4 central intersections. Each player will place 2 buildings (house, office, and/or pub) in any 'A' locations. Then, switchback style, they place 2 of their roads contiguously on the board. 

Each player starts with 21 action cubes. Each round, you must use at least 2. Rounds first have an action selection phase, which continues till all players pass. Actions are selected by placing one of your cubes onto the appropriate space on the Action Track. For each action, there may be one or more available spots -- some are filled in right to left, others left-to-right. In the next phase of the round, the actions on the Track are executed by players from left to right.

The actions are:
- Extend roads. The first player to place their cube in auction here plays last, but extends their network (from either/both ends -- if form a loop, use a cube to mark the head of the road) the most -- as many roads as the maximum # of buses any single player has (all start with 1). Each other player will play 1 fewer road, in the order that they chose the action. (5er game: everyone places 1 extra _road_)
- Get new bus. 1 player only.
- Build new buildings. Like roads action.
- Bring new passengers. Like roads action, but in placement order.
- Clock, with 5 stones set up at start. 1 player may select. When resolving, that player may choose to stop time = skip to next step, below. If they do, they take one of the 5 stones (-1 VP each at the end of the game); if the 5th stone is taken, game ends immediately. If they do not, advance the clock to the next position (starts at 'home', goes next to 'office' then 'pub' then back to 'home'). This indicates the type of building passengers want to go to this turn.
- Vrooom! The only way to score + VP. First, passengers will walk from intersection to the goal building if it is at the same intersection. Then, this is executed like roads, but in the order players chose the action (instead of backwards). Then the player vrooming moves 1 passenger per bus they have along their own roads to the desired location, scoring 1 VP each (show on score track).
- Start player. The player choosing this will start next round. If no one chooses, Start rotates to left.

The game ends at the end of the round if only 1 player has action cubes left, or at the Clock step if the 5th stone is taken. Most VP wins, with ties going to the player who got that score first (scoring marker on bottom of stack in the score track).

Wonderful, tight combination of worker placement, network building and pick-up-and-delivery. Passengers want to travel to home, work or the pub depending on what time of day it is and a player gets 1 point for each passenger so delivered. Scoring is only done by players who take the "Vroom!" action, in order; if you're late, there might be no-one left to move.

But that's not the only place where timing is important: in addition to the requirements like getting a new bus (only one player per round can do this), most other actions are cleverly, painfully intertwined. The building action can limit which passengers can move and to where; the route-building action facilitates access and blocking. Most delicious of all, one player per round has the opportunity to stop the clock, meaning passengers want to go to the same place again. This might mean that all those scoring actions have completely gone to waste...

It's a low-scoring game and players have only 20 actions for the whole game, so everything is wonderfully tight. The full package is a better worker placement game than almost any that have followed, with many opportunities for clever and subtle play in (with 3p) an hour or less. Great.

It's reputation as a "light" Splotter belies the intense brain burn the game actually provides. The shorter playing time (60-90 minutes) undoubtedly contributes to this perception, but there's a lot to think about here.

The action bidding mechanic is devilishly clever. The game of chicken that emerges around the place routes action is a true masterstroke.  

The option to stop the clock can paralyze opponents and cripple best-laid plans.

Splotter's most underrated game.

RATING: 8
This is an early worker placement game, in which you really can't get a big Bus "engine" rolling - it's far too easy for other players to block you or steal potential passengers.  With that in mind, the game is pretty good.  If you expect to rack up large scores, you'll probably be disappointed.  WIth the full five players, there will be a fair amount of wasted workers, since useful actions will dry up.

A fairly straightforward route-building, pick-up-and-deliver game with a worker (well, cube, actually) placement mechanic for deciding actions. Bus just didn't grab me, and felt a little dated (I'm guessing it was pioneering in terms of using a worker-placement system way back when it first came out, though). I also found the graphics/art to be not only unattractive but also too busy and distracting/confusing, as was the choice of having one of the bus lines be black when the roads being covered also are black, making the black route hard to see. Bus also is rather abstract, which doesn't help with my warming to the game. All in all, very average and slightly disappointing.

RATING: 6
OK, I understand the appeal of this game.  I honestly can say that I have played very few games where the randomness that comes from other players is so immense--I felt like I had nearly zero control over what I could do nearly halfway through the game.  It might be that the game is highly geared towards long range planning, but it is so difficult to plan effectively when your plans can be so thoroughly messed with--without dice, cards, etc.  I felt like it was a high-level strategy game that was pulling my leg.  Like most games, I would have to be in the mood to play again (Power Grid, Age of Steam, all the way down to PitchCar).  The limited (21) actions mechanic is the best part about the game--a very good equalizer.  Very cutthroat, potentially a very nasty game.

Bus is an interesting game of passenger delivery.  There is a lot of potential for screwage in this game.  You can build routes to block people off from getting passengers or getting to destinations, you can build the wrong building types on other's routes, you can steal the best action spots (Bus and 1st player) although that's almost mandatory, you can ship your passengers before the other players leaving them no passenger to ship or no destination to ship to, you can play later in the round and devalue other people's building action (possibly even denying them any action), or you can take the clock and prevent the destination changing and wrecking the plans of everyone who counted on that happening.  It's a tricky game to manage and hilarious when people's plans are completely screwed.

RATING: 7
The feeling is reminiscent of Cannes in some ways. Short, probably tie-prone (though not as much as Cannes), lots of potential things you could do on a turn, and both games involve laying down sticks.

I find Bus quite a bit more opaque than Cannes, as you often commit to taking a certain action without knowing who else will be taking it (and thus before you) and what the board will look like. There is no randomness (in contrast to Cannes) but the player-created chaos feels similar to randomness.

Related, the order in which you place workers to claim actions may or may not make a difference to whether your overall agenda for a turn is achievable. It's not sufficient to know what actions you want, and I find that a little unpleasant.

The opacity of the game is balanced by its shortness: I don't mind playing a game that baffles me if I can see the results quickly.

Not sure about replayability or scriptedness. Seems like an issue that the residents always appear in the same two spots, and the "priority" of the building spaces (which set in stone a general order that the spaces will be filled) don't change either.

Very enjoyable game.  4 new players 20 minutes to run through the rules and 1 hour to play - far quicker than expected.  Placement of buildings is key, to help you, and to hinder others.  The ability to use more actions where required is a very good mechanic.

Very pleasantly surprised. A wonder of invention. Of more than historical interest as the 'first worker placement,' it has an offbeat syncopation in the way the mechanic is embedded in the logistical theme & the game is about winning rather than a race collecting points (which seems to be how the mechanic has since been applied) . I'd love more plays, it could end my disgust for meeple mania.

Marc since gave Cole's beautiful redrawn board that he had mounted. I hope I find a table to play it.

Odd.  I liked this one.

There's been a bunch of games that feel like "chasing points," such as Terra Mystica and Trajan, that just don't grab me.  They just feel like peering at a complicated decision tree and trying to maximize the points.  They only seem to differ in whatever neato mechanic the designer dropped in to (presumably) distinguish his game.

It's also possible I'm just getting too old and the complicated stuff just isn't as exciting anymore.

Bus didn't have this problem.  It was easy to understand and all the action choices allowed both point chasing and screwing over the others.  The game also had an aspect of chicken to it in that there were times when players had to see an action taken but desperately wanted to avoid paying the cost themselves.

I'm not sure it'll hold up in the long run but I'd certainly try it again.

Another interesting game by Splotter. The game is surprisingly subtle and interesting for how simple the moving parts are. It has undoubtedly been the most popular recent addition to my game collection- people want to play it over and over cause it is relatively short, simple, but the strategy remains ever so slightly elusive and every game we reach some new epiphany. I wonder how I ever got by before without this seminal pick-up-and-deliver game.

I've only played the game twice, and each was a learning game.  In the first game, I attempted to learn from the rules while playing against some experienced players, and watched the game spiral out of my control.  In the second game, I had a better idea of how the mechanisms worked together, and I enjoyed planning my route and moving my passengers, even if I still didn't have a great grasp of the game.

I think people who like Age of Steam would like this game, since you're competing for limited actions, building a network, and delivering "goods" from one place to another.  There MAY be a significant start-player advantage, but with experienced players, I think it might be avoided.  I want to play MANY, MANY more times to find out.

Eén van de grondleggers van de worker placement.

Spelers leggen busroutes aan om passagiers door de stad te vervoeren naar het cafe, werk of huis. Hiervoor moeten ze nieuwe bussen aanschaffen, busroutes aanleggen en de stad uitbouwen.

Er zitten een paar interessante dingen in dit spel die je niet vaak meer terug ziet. De flow van het spel is erg bijzonder en timing is een kritieke factor in dit spel, naast zuinig zijn. Jammer genoeg worden de keuzes naarmate het spel vordert wel minder.

Played once face-to-face (with 4 players), and once on SBW. My first (face-to-face) play had not convinced me at all - I remember a very close, but uncontrollable game - but I'm glad I accepted to give it a second chance on Spielbyweb. There seems to be more control and planning possible than I thought at first, and the action stones mechanism is interesting, although it may be a bit frustrating. I'm not sure yet about the interest of stopping time - it seems costly for what it does - but I suppose I will know better after having played it again. My rating is very hesitant for now - it would have been a 4 after the first play, but now I think it is better than that. How much better remains to be seen.

Busy artwork and components of dubious quality (warped boards) aside, Bus is a very heady game that offers many ending conditions as well as multiple paths to victory.  It's true that there is only one way to score, by transporting passengers to their desired destination, but how to accomplish that feat depends on the players.  You can work with the clock and diversify the buildings on your route, or you can specialize and perform multiple deliveries in a round for as long as you have the people to take.  You can compete for fares and places by extending into your opponent's line, or you can operate in solitaire for as much as possible as long as you can introduce new riders at the stations.

It is all in the action management, since there are a limitied number of them, the difficulty in the decision becomes whether to make multiple small deliveries or save up for bigger ones?  Stopping the clock may not seem like a great choice at first (since you take a negative point for selecting the action), but it is actually quite powerful when used at the right time to prevent others from scoring.

Very high on screwage, and not forgiving for those that fall behind.  I would say that Bus rewards flexible short term moves, it's almost impossible to do any long term planning due to how often the board changes.

In retrospect we seem to have made a mistake on a rule.  If a passenger is already occupying the right kind of building, then you cannot move it again.

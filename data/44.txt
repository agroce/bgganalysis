+ Simple trick-taking game with one interesting twist; Plays fast and is easy to explain.
- Why not play one of the slightly more complicated card games that have a lot more depth to them?


Why it's previously-owned:
This game plays like an upgraded version of hearts.  The only trouble is that an upgraded version of hearts is still not nearly as good as many of the other card games that I own.
I traded this for Dragon's Gold.  We like to play No Thanks, Tichu, or Iliad instead when we want to play a card game.

I'm a big fan of trick taking games both traditional (Hearts, Spades) and thematic (Dragonmaster, 1981). I think David & Goliath is the least strategic of these games, as I never feel like I'm really in control of my strategy during the game. All card games involve a healthy share of luck, but this game seems like it is entirely too luck-driven.

RATING: 5.5
An interesting trick taking game with a unique mechanic - namely, in any tirck the lowest number takes the highest card, the highest card takes the rest.  You score for the face value for up to 2 cards in a suit collected; however, if you get 3 or more cards in a suit, each card counts only 1 point.  You have to follow suit (5 colors), but if you can't, your card's value still applies.  Cards range in value from 1 to 18.  Plays well with various numbers but the trick mechanic is a tad difficult to introduce to non-card players. [GTI: AGCL]

Was so highly regarded by Joe and Tom on the Dice Tower, I picked it up thinking it would get some play from the Card Playing Crew, but it flopped somewhat on it's debut.

Trick taking goodness. Trick taking games usually aren't my cup of tea, but for some reason I like this game. I did really well (coming in 2nd out of 5), and I really tried to do was stick the person with 2 or less of 1 color with that 3rd card that would lower his score. Seems to work. Give this a try if you like hearts, spades, Tichu, etc...

After my first play, I absolutely loved this game.  It's a real brain-burner of a trick-taking game.  I have never seen so much analysis-paralysis in a trick-taking game, but there are so many aspects to think about before playing each card that players sometimes have to take a moment.  This may come in as a favorite of mine after a few more plays.

Trick taking game where colours (suits) are followed if possible, but rank is more important. Lowest card takes the highest, highest card takes the rest. Latest played card breaks any ties. If you have 1 or 2 cards of a colour, score the full value. Over that, they count 1 point per card. Err, that's it.

A neat little card game which poses an interesting variation on the standard trick-taaking theme. Can teach it to anybody, expcially to anyone whos played cards, and have some fun. The design is a bit silly exploiting colors without pattern to distinguish suits which make it impossible for color-blind people to play, andthe game is a little heavy handed on the luck element for my tastes, but it plays well and entertains.

Rating based on one 5-person game.  I'm coming to the decision that trick-taking games are just not my cup of tea.  Throughout most of the game I felt as though I could just as easily have been randomly picking cards from my hand.  The other players liked it more than I did, though, so it's probably my issue and not the game's.

Simple mechanics. Seems fun enough. I've only played it with 3 people but it seems like it would probably work better with more. I haven't played it enough to learn if it can be controlled. It seems that whether you win or not is dependent on the hand you are dealt. I've got mixed responses from people I have played it with. My wife absolutely hates it. No one really gets excited about it. It gets a mediocre rating until I play it more. However, the fact that it doesn't seem to have the drawing power of some other games doesn't make me too optimistic that it's rating will rise.

While I love trick-taking games, the lack of control in this one, particularly in the endgame, was a bit off-putting.  Seems to reward luck more than precision, which means it is not my style of trick taking game.  Great fun for many, though, I am sure.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Nice trick taking variant, with the satisfaction of not only attempting to score yourself but being able to disrupt other's scores quite effectively.  The twists to the trick taking norms are that the lowest card takes the highest card and the highest card, which takes the rest, is determined regardless of suit.  Simple changes but the implications are fun.  It plays very quickly and tactically with 3 (30 mins for three hands).  More players makes it easier to build your own score but also harder to torpedo others; so play with less if you like it mean.

Interesting little trick taking game that I need to play more of to get a good feel for. While the lowest-takes-highest mechanism is certainly the most interesting part of the game, the somewhat set-collection-like scoring system (and the need to never exceed two cards in any given suit) is its driving force. Deciding between playing high, low, or right in the middle is almost always a tense decision. The only real flaw is that this is a game where you can easily get screwed by a bad hand. I want to play more of this to see how it affects my rating, but it's just plain hard to justify playing it when we have SO many good trick taking games already.

RATING: 4.5
This is an intriguing kind-of trick-taking card game! While the rules and the scoring are quite simple, the strategy isn’t – we all had a hard time figuring out what the best move was! And it was actually somewhat tense as we really tried to think ahead and pondering about which card would be the best to play each turn, so perhaps my rating is a little low, but that’s simply because, while not a bad game, it’s not a game I’m going to seek out. It lacks the “oomph” factor and it’s sort of a trick-taking game which is a genre I generally don’t like, so there is that.

Like all card games, you can have good and bad cards, but here you can actually use both the high and the low valued cards – it all depends on how many cards of a specific color you already have. Because the whole gist of the game is to get preferably two of each high valued card in each of the five different colors – thereby scoring the face value of those cards. But if you get three cards in the same color, each card only scores 1 point each… Ouch! So it’s extremely important to try to avoid getting a third card, but if you’re not the last player to play a card (which you probably rarely are), the other players can try to play in a way that grants you a card you don’t want (as the highest played card gets all the other cards, but the lowest played card gets the highest).

Again, not a bad game, but not a particularly interesting game to me, and there are many other cards games I would much rather play.

A bonafide filler trick-taking card game - as it only lasts one hand.  There are some neat "don't take certain types of cards" things going on.  Not the greatest filler - but definately not a bad one.

--Update: I highly recommend not playing with six.  The advantage of going last and controlling the trick is magnified with more players.

RATING: 7
Ultimately simple rules: Follow suit if you can.  Highest card last played in or off suit wins the trick and gives that card to the player of the last played lowest card in or off suit.  Suits of 2 or less cards score face value, all others are a point a card.

Very much a tempo and competitive positioning game.  Wonderfully counter-intuitive as good play patterns are emergent.

Seems to be best with 5 though also plays well with 3.  5 gives the broad variance in card values that allow for very attentive score calculation and hand figuring mid-game, and 3 allows for delightful hand management and misdirection. 4 seems to be a slightly worst-of-both-worlds.

An interesting little game. I'm looking forward to playing more to see what strategies can develop. It should go well with non-gamers. I'm not sure that you really need to play as many rounds as there are players. A five or six player game would run way too long for what the game is.

Very enjoyable trick-taking game where you have to try to get up to 2 of every suit but no more than two (or your score will plummet).  It can be really difficult to decide whether or not you want to take a hand.  Highly recommended game for this genre, though I hate to admit how much it strains my brain to figure out who gets what after every hand.  I must be getting old!

RATING: 3
I generally like trick taking games, but this is average at best. The hand you're dealt makes a huge difference. You can't really "salvage" a bad hand like you can in many good card games (e.g. Mu). The scoring is cleaver, but a bit out of whack, especially playing with 6 players. The face value of the high cards is just too high. The "cleverness" of the game (lowest card in the trick captures the highest card) just isn't nearly as interesting as, say, Bottle Imp. Still, it's decent, and the fact that my 3 year old can sometimes beat me by picking cards at random (not kidding--she can at least match colors to follow suit, as required) makes it some fun for our whole family.

Just when I think I've played every kind of trick-taking game there could be, my brother introduces me to another clever twist on the genre I've not tried before. This was definitely one of the better ones.

Here you're trying to balance a bit of the "get just enough" mechanism with an odd take on who gets the trick - basically the winner will always get all but one card, with that one going to another player.

It takes a bit to wrap your head around the rules, but once you do, the gameplay is fast and at times rather nasty! Good fun with a group with the right mindset.

Components: Neat characters, forming a continuous progression from David to Goliath. There is nothing in the game but cards; it could have come in a much smaller box.

Experience: Really chaotic. Toward the end of a hand, I can figure out what is still out there, and start to try really hard to win/avoid certain tricks. But until that moment, there is so much chaos. And accidentally winning/losing a trick can just be disastrous to my score.

Twisted thinking. Simple, but not straightforward at all. Low card takes high, high takes the rest. Cards you win are worth their face value, unless you get more than two of a color -- then each card is only worth one. Okay, but how to play well?

David & Goliath features some very interesting hand management and card-play choices with a clever twist on scoring.  Hand assessment can be quite tricky.  Like many trick taking games, you often want to be to the right of the lead, as the last player in each trick has the greatest advantage.  I think this may be best played with three, as it gives the player between the lead and the last much more room to manipulate the outcome of the trick.

I like this game, it's twisted take on a regular trick taking game. If you've played hearts or spades this game will mess with your head. Unfortunately, my girlfriend says it "hurts her brain" too much, so I guess I'll trade it.

Simple little trick-taking variant where you want to selectively win a few cards, but not too many. Played with 5 and it was a bit chaotic and grew a bit tired by the fourth hand. I've been doing surprisingly well just by trying to win as few cards as possible. Some AP since played cards are visible. Probably best just as a one or two hand filler.

A trick taking card game.  The first time I played this game, the room was not well-lit and I couldn't tell the colors apart from one another.  That partially soured me on it.  The game has some depth, but I just simply don't find it to be fun.

D&G is a trick taking game that has 2 features I really like.  One, there's no trump.  I like that because I always mess up trump.  Two, high cards, low cards, and middle cards are all useful due to the very clever scoring system.  Very fun, although a full game (one round for each player) would be too long.  Fortunately, you can just play a round or two.

RATING: 6
Another decent trick-taking card game.  After having played Sticheln, I think I'm focusing more about how I affect other players compared to what will get me a higher score.  This requires more thought to evaluate since acquired cards are played face-up in a tableau compared to just going face-down until the end of the round.  In this game, two people will acquire cards as the tricks are resolved: David (the player who plays the lowest valued card regardless of suit) and Goliath (the player who plays the highest valued card regardless of suit).  Your objective is to get the highest valued cards in a suit up to a maximum of two cards per suit because one or two cards in a suit will score positive points equal to their face value but if you exceed two cards per suit, each card will be only worth 1 point per card.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This strange twist on trick taking creates some very interesting moments. Players must follow suit, but suit does not play a role in determining the trick winners, which is very peculiar and a bit counterintuitive. Despite this, the game teaches and plays very quickly. Wanting to be Goliath or David (or neither) will change trick-to-trick and from player-to-player, which helps the game from devolving into a simple flip of the cards.

I liked the scoring system....but

Game-wise I was disappointed in two rules; off-suit cards are legal "winning" plays and the last card of the same value trumps previously played cards. I'm not sure this is good with 5 players either, but regardless I would play again if only to confirm my ambivalence towards D&G. 

I would rather Hearts, Spades, Euchre, Mü, Coup d'état or ANY other trick-taking game.

I do understand that this is intended or pitched as a family game, but all of the previously mentioned games were taught to me by my family, so in context this game pales in comparison.

I enjoyed this one.
A trick taking game where there are no trumps and each round the highest card goes to the david player, the player who played the lowest card and the rest of the cards go to the goliath player, the player who played the highest card.

In the initial rounds a couple of players struggled to grasp exactly how the point scoring worked so the game was slightly skewed in favour of those who picked up the rules quickly however after the five rounds scores were much closer than we would have anticipated after the first round.

I think I prefer black spy to this trick taking game but I do like the artwork with the mouse slowly morphing from a small and scrawny 'david' to a meatier bulkier 'goliath' on the higher numbered cards

Playroom edition, 2004.

I bought it because of the good reviews, but this has to be one of the more ugly looking games I own--in fact have had it many years & could not bring my self to open it.  I am going to be gone most of this summer, so playing all my smallest (travel-sized) never-before-played games to see if I can find some winners. 

As always with dealt cards there is the luck element, but there is a very unusual play strategy that needs some figuring out, so I have a lot of interest in playing the game.

I have only played with 3, and feel that more would be better, giving more opportunities for control with less luck.  We'll see.

This is definitely a travel game in the running and also as a filler for my gaming group.  Just wish it weren't so graphically unappealing.

Ow.  This one always hurts my head a little.  Most people I've played with agree.  It's just a simple trick taking game, but whomever plays the LOWEST card gets the BIGGEST card.  The biggest card player gets the rest.  Cards are worth their value if you have less than 3 in a color.  After that they're worth one point each.  Plays quick, and definitely forces you to twist your brain around.

Not a bad trick-taker in a hobby chock-full of trick-taking games.  The components are not so great, sadly, and I am not sure what is up with the artwork.

This game can also be played with a Sticheln deck.

I don't usually care about card or more precisely trick taking games.  Evenso, I found this one to be challenging with enough competition to be satisfying, but without the outright cutthroat feel of some.  Also a nice twist to the typical trump, where low card takes high in a hand.  Probably would pick this up, if I saw it in store.  Themed loosely on the Biblical story, but wouldn't let that scare people away as it's a good game in it's own right.

A good game that bends the brain. It can be difficult to figure out exactly what is the best play. The game ran much longer than the suggested time for our group, I think because they over-analyzed plays. I think only three rounds are necessary to enjoy the game, despite the number of players.

A good, challenging trick-taking card game that makes for a good filler. The highest ranked card takes the trick, but there's a twist: the lowest ranked card takes the highest ranked card. Players score a point for each card won. However, if players have one or two cards of a 'suit' from won tricks, then the score is the combined rank values of the one or two cards, which makes for lots of points. Comments have been made that if one doesn't have any low ranked cards, they don't have a chance at scoring big, and so it is all up to what cards are dealt. This is somewhat mitigated by playing a number of hands equal to the number of players, so the luck may smooth out, but you never know. It definitely ranks above many "stupid-fun" games out there that I've played.

Update (08/01/09) 2 plays: If I want to play bridge, I'll play bridge instead. I get frustrated being forced to play a trick-playing game for 90 minutes when I'm here to board game, not get "bored" with games.

Update (1/8/11) 3 plays: If you have to accommodate non-gamers, with a group of six, this may fill the bill. Enough bridge-like strategy and tactics to keep me from losing my mind, but heavily dependent on the cards you get.

A good trick-taking game. Original rule seems to state that the number of rounds is equal to number of players but I think you need to adjust the number of rounds accordingly to the number of players. There should be an average of 2.5 rounds per player so that each player takes 5 tricks for the Game, 1 for each color. The strategy varies depending on the number of rounds as well, making it a highly replayable game for different number of players. My uni mates love it

This turned out okay, but not as awesome as I had anticipated.  It felt like a mediocre "Hearts" to me.  Most of the time you were just worrying about poisoning the other player's lots.

The general pros and cons of trick taking games came through here.  With no trump and no bidding, the luck of the deal did seem to be with you somewhat.  Low cards and high cards were powerful, but the middle cards were just a pain in my butt.

I'll play it again if it gets brought up, but I'll stick to other trick taking games in the mean time.

This was quite a good trick game. You are trying to do two things, well three actually. You want to take one or two high cards in each suit, you want to avoid taking some very bad tricks by playing your high cards at strategic times and you want to stick it to the leader if possible. Lots to think about when playing, I like this about the same as Gang of Four. The 6 player game was very fun but definetly too long. 4 rounds would of been enough and there is no real reason to have one per player so easily fixed.

This is a fun card game in which the player who played the lowest card takes the highest card, and the player who played the highest card takes the rest of the cards.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (October 2014)

David & Goliath was one of the games I most wanted to play since I began playing boardgames on 2010. The reason? At the time, I heard very good things about it from Tom Vasel. It’s been some years and now I know that he and I differ in A LOT of games, however when I saw the opportunity to buy it I did.

I really like the Trick Taking game genera but the game disappointed me a bit (and I wasn’t expecting much). After reading the rules I was excited because the player who played the lowest card took the highest card, it seemed like a great twist, but I found the game to lack in the decisions department, it is perhaps the shallowest Trick Taking game I have ever played. I’m not sure about the strategy, it seems you can’t make good plays with a bad hand (uncontrollable luck) AND it also seems you will do great if you have lots of low cards (due to the scoring). I will play again soon to see if this is true.

At least it plays fast, otherwise I would rate it a lot lower. The art is functional but kind of ugly. 

Bottom line, David & Goliath is a borderline 6.0 to me. I feel luck, not strategy, has the upper hand here. Lots of chaos (lacks control). It will probably go down in my personal ratings with more plays. I think it is a good family game.

I'll have to play this with more players.    It really doesn't work that great for three though we did play 3 rounds of it.    The low card takes the highest card and the high card takes everything else. It seemed like in this game it wasn't what you took, it was what you avoided.

RATING: 7
Fun trick taker with a couple of twists: player of the lowest card in a trick takes the highest card played on the trick (the others going to the trick taker in the normal manner), and cards only score face value at the end of the round if you have only taken 1 or 2 cards of that suit, otherwise they only score a single point. This often makes leading tricks a burden and means control of low cards (which are more likely to capture high cards) important

Interesting card game with the "highest is good, lowest is good, middle kind of stinks" mechanic giving it a twist over normal card games.  There is definitely the luck of the deal involved, and other than that, I find it challenging.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I love the lowest card takes the highest card mechanism, but there is too much of a lack of finesse in this game. You mostly have to rely on luck to get rid of high cards, where in other games you can short-suit yourself and get rid of them by sloughing.

Rating based on 4 playings.  So far, it isn't better than the other trick taking games out there: Sticheln, Hattrick, Die Seiben Segel, Mit Liste und Tucke.   Not sure why.  Seems like you have less control in this game.

RATING: 7
This is a great game with 3, a solid game with 4, and a terrible one with more. The strategy is so different from other trick taking games, which is both its strength and its weakness: after  many games, I'm still not sure of what is a good strategy, which again, is both a strength and a weakness.

Fun trick taking game with a twist.  The lowest card captures the highest valued card, while the highest takes all the rest of the cards.  At the end of a round, you add up the totals in each suit.  For every suit you have 1 or 2 cards of, you add their face value.  If you have more than 2 cards of a color, each count only 1 point.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Neat little trick taking game with a couple twists.  Lowest card in the turn receives the highest card of that round for scoring & final scoring gives you face value of the cards in a color of which you have 1 or 2 cards but only 1 point for those cards in a color of which you have 3 or more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I would like this game more if it were played a bit more like a standard trick taking game in that the highest and lowest cards of the suit led gathered the other cards.  I realize that there is apparently quite a bit of strategic depth here that I haven't been able to access but I feel that the game would be much improved if it kept the intriguing scoring system at the end but made following suit important for taking cards.

An interesting little trick-taking game, although I'm not sure yet whether it is too chaotic to make meaningful decisions, or if it is just very very subtle and complex. It's also not clear how big a role luck will play yet.

Requires further investigation. There is huge potential for movement either way in my rating.

UPDATE: Suffers pretty bad from "what the hell do I do with this hand" syndrome. I'll still play it, at least with three, but it's not close to top tier. 5.

another trick taker. This time the interest is in the scoring and avoiding getting too many of one thing to max the score. I can see that there is both positive and negative decisions to mare for yourself and against opponents.

PLayed with 4 players the low win and the limited card scoring are nice as are winning tricks containing cards out of suit messing you up. Its a little like black sheep (with the FFG variant) in that regard. I liked this but for 1/2 the groupt this was too complicated .

RATING: 6
Trick-taking game where the lowest card played gets the highest card and the highest card played gets all the other cards in the hand. Players are trying to get one or two cards in each suit (their are 5) since then they're worth face value.  Anything over 2 cards in a suit makes each card in that suit worth only one point.  The game felt like Sticheln and Foppen in that a lot of the time you're trying to minimize damage.  Also, you don't really want to lead... there are some definite control issues but overall it's a worthwhile experience every once in awhile.

David and Goliath at first glance looks down-right corny. The game looks like a second rate game that had a bible theme slapped on to it so that the Christian folk would come and eat it up. Upon seeing the game talked up by the dice tower I saw it at my local religious store and picked it up. I have to say I ate my words after playing it. There is actually a game in there! The theme even fits! My game group doesn't dabble in trick taking games much but this game seems to be the exception to the rule. The game is tense for a trick taking game and is light enough to make conversation around the table plentiful. Great trick taking game and definitely in my top 5 in the genre.

A trick taking game with a twist. Players only score the printed value of cards if they have 2 or less of any given colour at the end of a round. 

Collect more than 2 and each card only scores 1 point. Taking the tricks is also quite 'thinky' as the lowest card played will take the single highest card played in the trick and the highest card played takes the other remaining cards. 

A nice light filler game but maybe a little too chaotic for pure trick taking fans. This is really quite under-rated on the Geek. It is a meaty game for its size though and takes a good hour. That may catch people unawares.

RATING: 5
I love trick taking games, but this one didn't do much for me. It's got some good ideas, but in practice they make the game very chaotic. There's really not a lot of ways to finesse the tricks as once a player is out of a suit, every other suit is trump. If you don't get to play last, you really have little control over what the outcome of a trick will be. It's also too much of a swing to go from 30+ points ina suit down to 3 because of being unlucky. One other gripe is that the blue and purple suits look way too similar. To all card game designers and publishers - either make the colors very distinctive or have different symbols or pictures to differentiate the suits. A lot of times, even people who aren't color blind have a lot of trouble if the lighting isn't right, so it's something to keep in mind at all times.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Neat slightly above average trick taking game that requires some non-traditional thinking as you finesse ways to grab one or two cards of a suit but no more.  Worth at least a few more plays, at which point this will probably drop to a 5.

---update---
There's less here than I'd thought - too often the hand plays you.  Strongly recommended that you play with fewer players - having 5 or 6 makes the amount of control negligible.

RATING: 6
With 15 tricks, and only wanting to collect 10 cards (2 or less in a colour and they score face value, anything more than 2 in a colour and each card in that colour scores 1 rather than face value), this is a study in avoiding tricks. The problem is it's very difficult to short suit yourself with 15 cards ... but then again, shortsuiting yourself in this game is less meaningful than usual as the highest card regardless of colour wins the trick. It's difficult to escape some bad outcomes if you're stuck with high cards - you'll win tricks but they'll transfer your colours into low scores. The perfect hand is choc-a-bloc with low and middling cards where you can pick off single high cards from the tricks played. Unfortunately there's no balancing mechanism to allow you to discard / offload bad cards to improve your winning chances. A study in managing randomness really. I don't mind exploring it every now and then to see if I can play the 'low takes high, high takes the rest' mechanism better, but it's by no means a favourite.

Based on one play: A very chaotic trick taking game. The lowest card wins the largest card and the largest card wins the rest of the trick. It is very hard to control and being the trick leader gives you no benefit and actually leaves others to decide your future. You need a lot of low cards in your hand to have a chance. I doubt I would play this again with all the other great trick taking games I already play.

This is an interesting trick-taking game whose scoring feels a little similar to Coloretto: you want some cards but if you get too many, it will be bad for you.

Getting dealt a hand of high-numbered cards seems bad here.

Great family trick-taking card game. The scoring really evens out some the factors that usually sets experienced card-players apart from beginners and kids. The card quality is flimsy, and that's putting it generously.

RATING: 6
A trick taking novelty in which the low cards are quite powerful. Helps address a bad deal, however, the resolution of a trick goes against tradition, so causes confusion. Some players may not be bothered to overcome this aspect. My main gripe is that won cards become displays making evaluations unwieldy, and as in Schotten Totten, very competitive players may slow game pace towards the end as they deduce the best play. Hence I prefer playing with 3. Good sitcom as a player's high score is dramatically reduced.

Yet another trick taking card game (with some counter-intuitive twists). This is extremely chaotic and very little strategy or tactics are possible. Why play a game in which you have almost no control over your fate?

Christmas 2007. Played a few times with non gamers. Fairly easy to understand the rules, but understanding the strategy is much harder. Really nice trick taking game.

The change in standard trick taking of the lowest value card potentially being the most rewarding, makes this an interesting game. 

Taking tricks has value in controlling the next lead, but your scoring is generally driven by your low cards. Having to carefully watch the number of cards taken in each suit forces some hard choices, you want to put your opponents in that dilemma. 

However the enjoyment didn't last

another one of those cut-throat games disguised as a family game, or even as a kids game. don't play this with kids.  I'm not convinced this is a great game; it's easy to get a good score with a good hand, and you can finesse your way to a decent score with an iffy hand, but there are some hands that you are just going to whiff on.

Also, I don't usually dock points for bad components, and I didn't here, but these cards are awful.  The artwork is pointless and the cards are too thin to last long.  Worst of all, because the colors go all the way to the border, you can make good guesses about what cards are from the back if you pay enough attention.  If this game sounds interesting to you, I recommend getting Rage and using it to play D&G with up to 5 players.

A clever card game. It takes a few plays to get your head around but once you start developing strategies you will notice that it is very well balanced and you will always be so close to the perfect set and something or someone will jeopardize it and you are keen to try again.

I liked my first game of David & Goliath since it felt so wonderfully counter-intuitive: All suits other than the one lead can trump, and you can also "trump" by playing low cards.

After more playings, my opinion of this game dropped sharply. It felt not as deep as I initially thought. The game actually feels like Hearts, since you are really trying to avoid winning tricks, except that players that hold the lowest cards are rewarded a bit too much.

What happens is that the players who hold all the low cards win all the high valuable cards, and the players who hold the high cards end up doubly screwed -- the end up taking a lot of cards (and lots of cards means not many points) while end up losing the potential points of these high cards.

Many players have mentioned that players should be rewarded more by collecting lots of cards -- perhaps that could be a scoring variation.

I suppose it's too early for me to be critical about this game; there are ways to throw away those high cards to other players. And of course, it's a card game, so multiple hands should mitigate the luck factor. However, once you figure out the basic tactics of this game, it's about as deep as Hearts, which is fine, but the tempo is not as fast as Hearts. If I want to play a trick taking game that requires as much calculation as D&G, I'd rather play Mu or Cosmic Eidex or another game that has a bidding round to help mitigate the luck.

This would have rated a 6, but the poor graphic design (repetitive artwork, and a very hard-to-read yellow suit) drops it by one rating.

RATING: 6
It's a fairly ordinary trick-taking card game at the core, but the scoring method creates interesting strategies. Ultimately, the best way to score points is probably to lose every trick. But you could play it with an ordinary deck of cards, or a tarot deck, and have almost the same game without buying a specialized deck.

Interesting idea for a trick taking game, and definitely makes for tough choices.  I traded it away however because it just wasn't "fun." Plus, in a family setting it would be easier to play something more familiar like Spades or Rummy.

21-02-2015. Rated after 1 play. Played the same evening as Diamonds. D&G is an interesting trick-taking game, but it's quite thinky. The game doens't have traditiona suits and you 'win' by getting the most points. You do this by collecting all cards in each trick you scored during the round.You scoring the amount of cards you have of each suit, if you have two or more cards of that suit. HOWEVER, if you have 1 or 2 cards of the suit, you score the printed numbers.. so potentially this is A LOT of points.

The thing is, the player who plays the lowest number, gets to take the highest card of the trick into their collection.. while the person who wins the trick gets those two. So it's really difficult and thinky at times to see what you should play.

The game... is ok. I'd say it's too complicated for what it is. The group I played it with, played it after diamonds which was VERY quick and effortless compared to this game. It feels, for me, that I have to think too much in order to get points. Artwork is pretty drab for what it is.

I have played quite a lot of trick-taking games and I like to play them. 7 Signum being the best there is. D&G is yet another game adding some twist to the usual game play. For each trick the player who played the lowest card get the highest card and the winner of the trick takes the others. First two cards per suit (there are five suits) count as their face value but if you go over 2 you get one point per card. Rather interesting but no idea how the game should be played. Planning on how to play your hand is next to impossible which kind of waters down the whole premise of this type of a game.

Megint egy kártyajáték ahol az agyadat át kell programozni, hogy megértsed a rendszerét. Ennél egy kicsit nehezebben ment az átállás, valahogy nem tudtam felfogni. Aki a legnagyobb értékű lapot rakta viszi az ütést, de előtte a legkisebb értékű lapot kirakó játékos elviszi a legnagyobb értékű lapot. A játék végén színek szerint ellenőrizzük a lapokat, amelyikből 1 vagy 2 van, ott a lapok értéke számít, ahol több ott a lapok száma. Nekem egy kicsit nehezen tervezhető volt a játék, de úgy láttam, hogy a többiek sem találták meg a helyes stratégiát. Ha esetleg van ilyen, akkor a játék is többet fog érni, most csak egy szerencsejáték.

I like the twist in this particular trick-taking game. It's not a difficult concept, but it takes a play or two for the strategies to reveal themselves and click.  When they do, the game becomes really interesting and slightly addictive.  This really is a great trick-taking game with a classic-feel.  The only bad thing I have to say about it is that the yellow numbers on the cards in the "Metal Box Edition from Pegasus Spiele" are nearly impossible to read even when held in front of your face.  I will most likely need to outline them with a black Sharpie before playing with them again.  I hate to do that, but it's tricky to play the game when the card values are not able to be easily read.

Playable with Sticheln deck.

Deal out all the numbered cards (5 colors). Must follow led suit if able: lowest card takes the highest card; highest card takes the rest of the cards and leads next. Won cards are placed face up in like-colored stacks. At the end of the hand, cards are worth face value if you took 1 or 2 in that color; otherwise, 1 pt per card. Play 1 hand per player ... highest points wins.

Just one play, 3er: too much analyzing! I think this would be better with more players, and maybe with a face down trick pile so everyone isn't doing calculations every hand!

[Playroom entertainment 2004 edition] {Mythology; trick-taking; optimal 4p} D&G is an ordinary trick-taking game with some twists in the scoring rule and the trick-taking part. It's quite chaotic with 5-6p but is tactical with 4p. It is suitable for families and students. Compared to other good trick-taking games, D&G is less tactical but it is quite fun, esp. when a player is forced to take more cards.  One has to decide in advance which colors to collect and which colors to sacrifice because a player cannot collect only 1/2 cards each color. Unless you are a fan of trick-taking games, you may not need to add this game in your collection.

I don't quite like the illustration of the cards, though it's effective and funny at the first look.

Fun little trick taking game. Easy to teach and learn. The last group I played this with didn't like this game that much - said there isn't enough control and that you just get screwed the whole time. Well, that might be true, but that's part of the point - screw the other guy as much as you can. Which is to say that rather than controlling your own scoring (which you can do a little) you have to control the other guys scoring.

Nice quick trick taker with some fun mechanics.  I'm guessing the starting hand is the biggest factor between winning and losing as there seems to be very little to mitigate a bad draw.

It plays light and quickly so it is quite enjoyable, but its not a classic filler in my opinion.  Willing to give it more plays to wrap my brain around it.

I really enjoy this game.  It is easy to pick up and explain.  The game mechanics are pretty basic, though some are counter-intuitive.  The hardest and most fascinating thing about the game for me is hand evaluation.  I never have a clue how many points to hope for when I first pick up my cards.  It seems that any hand can end up a great hand if played right and a horrible hand if played wrong.

Very interesting card game.  Never before have I been so torn between whether I should take a trick or not!  See my review for more details...

A bit of a mind melt the first time, but a simple rules twist makes this an exceptional card game. I get the feeling the strategies would be totally different with 3 players versus 6.

Game is intriguing but was lukewarm in its reception with our group. Hopefully I will get to play it more since I enjoyed how hard it is anticipate how it is going to go. Another strike against it is the art design is awful. I wish they had stuck to the whimsical art of the first version.

This game is quick to teach and very fun, as there are no bad cards. High, middle and low cards are all useful. It's a great introductionary trick taking game, as there are no trumps.

Yet another quirky trick taking game.  It's amazing how throwing a few odd rules in can suddenly open a number of really interesting strategies.  This game does that well.

Like many trick taking games, it can be played for just a short game, and still be fulfilling.  There's a decent amount of randomness in it (low cards are almost always good to have), but the way the rounds play out can be highly entertaining.  This is probably the best score I've given to any trick taking game.

Yet another in a long line of twisty trick-taking games, but I like this one, too.  It's reminiscent of Sticheln in some respects, since it's possible to take cards you don't want if you take the lead too soon, but it has its own little challenges that make it different.  Very fun.

Simple to learn, but extremely hard to win on purpose. Got rid of this game.  Interesting to play but I don't think the strategy is there enogh.  Sometimes you just get stuffed over.

Quite a clever trick taking game. Any game which provides opportunities to stitch up other players always goes down well in my group. Takes too long with the suggested number of hands though if playing with a lot of players.

A trick taking game where you don't always want the cards you get. Because all tricks taken are laid openly on the table for all to see it means you have to put up a good fight to to keep what you have.  If I was rating amongst trick games I would give it a 10.

This card game adds a very interesting twist to the standard trick-taking genre. There are five suits and players must follow suit, if they can. However, the winner of the trick is the highest card played, regardless of suit. The winner gets all the cards from the trick, minus the card he won it with. That card is given to the player that played the lowest card. Players score the face-value of the cards in the suits that they only collected one or two of, and one point per card for suits with more than two.

RATING: 6
A simple tricktaking game with a very nice twist: the player who played the highest value card wins the trick and receives all cards, except for the highest card. The player who played the lowest card receives that card. 
Combined with an elegant scoring mechanism, David & Goliath makes for a easy-to-explain game with lots of opportunity to stab other players in the back. 
The only drawback is that the cards are a bit flimsy.

Excellent and simple trick-taking game. The Biblical theme actually integrates well into the mechanics as well, and it makes sense. I'm not a big fan of trick-taking games though (I'm bad at them).

I really like trick taking card games, especially ones with a little twist that adds a layer of nuance to conventional trick games. David & Goliath provides that twist, as the cards gained during a trick ebb and flow in value -- grabbing 1 or 2 powerful cards is great, until you get a few more dumped on you, crashing their value from the printed value on the card to 1 point per card. Rewards card counting and a bit more thoughtfulness/awareness of cards played than other games, keeping it from being lightning fast like, say, Wizard, but still a lot of fun.

David and Goliath - a trick-taking game with five suits and a twist.

RATING: 6
An odd trick-taking game that takes almost a whole first game (at least, for me) before things start clicking.  There's some backwards-thinking necessary to do well at David & Goliath; if you don't mind that or luck in your trick-taking games, then you'll enjoy David & Goliath.

After 1 Play: The game's greatest weakness is the last card of each round, which is totally random and can really mess with a player's score.  Even so, this is a fun twist on the trick-taking genre.  If you already like that style of game you may well enjoy this, but if you don't I doubt this game will change your mind.

Awesome trick-taking game that works surprisingly well and isn't so complicated that it keeps casual card lovers out in the cold. Really glad to own this one.

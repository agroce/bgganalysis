Knizia does it again!  (And by "it," I mean improve on someone else's design.)  This fixes [b]Blokus[/b] and is a decent game in its own right.  I don't know if it will fire that game, but it definitely deserves its own place on the shelf.

There's a nagging feeling you get when you play Callisto and that is 'why aren't I playing Ingenious or Blokus'. It's also incredibly ugly and has cheap components.

This is Knizia's take on Blokus. The only differences are that you connect side-to-side instead of corner-to-corner, and you have pedestals that mark starting spaces including one you can throw down later in the game. I enjoyed it, but for some reason it felt a little weaker than Blokus. The game is extremely quick, partially because it was easier to block someone out and eliminate them from contention. I'll have to see over more plays, but the board is so tight the walls close in very quickly. Still, I enjoy playing and might choose this as a faster alternative to Blokus. I also would be interested to see how it would play if you did the multiple games with scores added up because that would certainly change how players target one another.

Juego abstracto del knizia, con cierto parecido al Catedral, de ir colocando piezas "encerrando" o dificultando la colocación a los adversarios. Al final de la ronda, cada jugador puntúa por la superficie de las piezas que no ha podido colocar. 

Se juegan tantas rondas como jugadores haya y el que menos puntos obtenga es el ganador. Es un juego sencillito y fácil de jugar y de explicar.

Recomendable para no jugones.

Similar to Blokus. I love both games and played Callisto a lot with friends, who sometimes prefer Callisto to Blokus. Thanks to the different board sizes, the game can be played with equal pleasure with 2, 3 or 4 players, which is very appreciable, because Blokus is really best with 4 players (as playing the 4 colors is mandatory).

Played a demo copy in a store and kept wondering if we had rules wrong (we didn't) or pieces missing (nope) because it was just WAY too easy to place all pieces on the board.  Granted, I played a 2p and a 3p game each with my kids, so nobody was too aggressive, but really, is this all there is to it?  I like the idea of the 3rd pillar to use mid- to late game to stir things up a bit, but even so, Blokus just works so much better.
Edit: Played Matthew Marquands (great!) online version 4p against 3 AI players and was still easily able to place all my tiles.  Will have to try a few more times, but it seems to confirm my suspicion that there just isn't much to get excited about here.
Edit:  Tried again -- a better experience this time - actually had a tile or two left each time.  Still not something that gets me too excited, but fun to fool around with once in awhile.  Will have to try more with my kids.

Components: Slightly unattractive with its knobs and candy colors. The pieces don't fit as securely on the board as I would like.

Experience: A bit too much like Blokus for my tastes. Both are in the Go family, in that I am primarily concerned with keeping my pieces alive (i.e. with air to breathe and expand into). The additional pillar, placed toward the end, is a fun touch. Ho-hum.

RATING: 7.5
Very similar to Blokus, but with some subtle differences that make it more accessible to smaller kids.  I like it quite a bit.  In one area it is superior to Blokus, and that is the scaling from 2-4 persons, including 3, by changing the board size.  So for three players this is better.   
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A tile placement game which feels much similar to Blokus in that you want to block off areas in order to place all your tiles. It’s easier to block off here since you place the tiles orthogonally, but you have two starting points and can start a new during the game. I think it is pale in comparison to Blokus, mainly because the board doesn’t feel as congested here, is more forgiving and it is easier to block off areas. At the same time this isn’t a bad game.

RATING: 8.5
Twenty plays, ranging from two to four players. An excellent game which I would describe as versatile, because the rules are simple enough that you can easily introduce it to non-gamers but it's still interesting enough that it's fun for gamers as well. On top of that it's nice and durable and handles every number in its player range quite well. 

As far as the game play goes, players must get rid of all their tiles, and this implies curbing your opponents' options wherever you can. The third starting pillar held back in reserve is a typical brilliant Knizia touch, as it adds interest and keeps people from getting knocked out too early from boneheaded mistakes. 

One thing I'd like to mention is that you really need to play one round per player as the rules suggest, since the starting player will always have an advantage. Some might imagine that this might make the game repetitive, but actually it adds an extra degree of fun, particularly in the three- and four-player games, as players harry the leader while stragglers try to sneak under the radar. The two player game takes about twenty minutes, the four-player game takes an hour. I think I like the game best with three, as there's more drama and surprise than the two-player game but it's not as long as the four-player game.

On a final note, a lot of people are saying it's too similar to Blokus, but I've never played Blokus, so that's not an issue for me. Anyway, Blokus isn't original either: see Sudden Death.

Played it a couple of times.  Seems to be pretty simple to teach, but not particularly challenging.  There is a lot of player interaction as players try to grab as much space as they can while blocking other players.  The best strategy seems to be to section off parts of the board for your sole use -- but of course other players try to prevent that.  Multi-player games can be especially difficult since you have to choose which front to fight on.

Wow, what a an agressive and intense game in Blokus style (though FAR from a copy of it).
  I really like it.

The only drawback is that in 2-player mode, starting player has a huge advantage (that's why it's recommended to play a series of games with alternating starting player).  3-, 4-player games - no problem.

At first seems like a family version of Blokus, that drops the symbiotic/parasitic duality of corner-to-corner placement in favour of intuitive side-to-side fencing. There is a bit more than that to it, though. It's possible to get stomped if other players gang up on your starting positions, but there's a safety valve in the form of the third pillar, which otherwise presents an interesting decision: play it early, when it can't be immediately blocked off, or play it late, when you know where you want it? Applying the tie-break rule in a multiplayer game seems inappropriate.

"Knizia's take on Blokus/Gemblo" is a great concept for a game, but Callisto doesn't deliver. It isn't nearly as exciting as the games that obviously inspired it, which might have something to do with Callisto's very basic tile set (no angst of getting rid of big, complex tiles like in Blokus).

Also worth mentioning is that usually abstracts like these are visually pleasing, but Callisto is a surprisingly ugly game (it looks better in pictures than live) with unappealing second rate components.

Not better than Blokus... But it's a lot better for 3 or 2 than Blokus... Also while the starting set-up adds more variability to the game, the third column provides some interesting possibilities. 
And of course if you want a Blokus-like game for 3 or 2, Callisto might work. Also if you rate Blokus high you just can't say you rate Callisto low for the lack of originality - see my review here: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/5319936#5319936

Received a complimentary version for review.

Blokus-light but I don't intend that to be derogatory. In some situations, Blokus can be a bit thinky and Callisto fits the bill for those lighter "play with friends" or "play with kids" situations where you just want a semi-cerebral activity to do while interacting in other ways.

I like the design of the board with the indentions to keep the tiles in place.  The colors are easily distinguishable. I cannot comment on how the game appears to the color blind.

Callisto gets knocks for the "ugly" board but what's to be ugly here. It works fine for me.  It's an abstract, you don't get much artistic awe in that space.

I've played this before, but back in my day, it was called Blokus.  All the children would gather round the table with their Media-packets (we called them Mp3 players back then) and their space-leggings (we called them "pants" in those days) to play Blokus, and boy was it a treat.

Then one day I spotted ole' Reiner sailing by in an airship, which in those days was called a rocket ship.  He was dropping copies of Callisto for all the girls and boys.  We took one look at it and said "Thanks Mister, now we can have something to burn over the long Winter", which in those days was called "Summer".

Anyways, back to my story.  Then in the late 90s I .... zzzzzzzzz....

It's fine and pleasant enough for an abstract, but it's so obviously a ripped off cross-breed version of Blokus and Cathedral that it's hard to give credence to the story that Knizia plays only his own games. The one innovation is that you can create a new spawn point at some point in the game, usually behind enemy lines in an area that someone's blocked off for themselves, meaning the game is about minimising the amount of broad open space that can be appropriated by another player. Which makes for less tension than the other games, making for a less appealing game. Having said that, if you'd never played the others, it's a pleasant tile laying abstract.

Unfortunately abstract games are seldom as fun as thematic games. This is a little "dry" and same every time. 

Playing with four (or even three) it's easy for two to team up and quickly corner the others. If this is good or bad is up to you, I don't like it.

RATING: 3
Based on one play: I am not really sure why this game was even created, it is basically just Blokus. Even when it was explained, Blokus was used as the reference point. You place pieces one the board with at least one face touching, unlike in Blokus where they can only touch by the corners. The only difference is that you chose two starting points and  may add a third one if you get stuck.

RATING: 7
Yeah yeah yeah, Knizia is accused of ripping off Blokus here.  But it IS different enough to warrant owning both.  I love the way it scales to 2, 3, or 4 players, which Blokus does not do that well.  Plus, the pillars add a little more strategy to it.  With 4 players, Blokus gets the nod.  But with 2 or 3, I prefer Callisto. Great fun.

If this game hadn't been by Knizia, I would have written it off as a Blokus knock-off.  In fact, it plays very differently and some of the quirks of the game have fascinating implications.

update:  It certainly scales well to 3 players, which is a nice change from Blokus.  However, I feel much less clever about my plays, and there are fewer opportunities for semi-cooperation with a neighbor and much more direct obvious blocking.

I find Blokus to be more aesthetically pleasing (e.g. that Blokus has exactly 1 of each possible type of piece, where Callisto has an odd empirically determined distribution of pieces).

But Callisto is worthy and has stood up to repeated play through the years for us.

Choosing your 2 starting locations, and then optionally deciding to place a 3rd starting location during play, is nifty.

Ten years ago, I would have called it a remarkable game. Today, truth be told, it's more or less a Blokus clone, albeit a good one. See my review...

Best new game I've played in 2016. Excellent aggressive territory abstract game that feels kind of like Go but plays in 20-30 minutes, and can play up to 4 players, and can be taught in two minutes.

An interesting pseudo-Blokus game (and in fact I like it much more than Blokus because you don't have to play as obsessively to do well).

This is a great game to play with younger children.

Think of tetris with competitive space management in it.  I think it would be good for perception ability, and how to deal with 2 dimensional shapes in their surroundings.

Finalmente un gioco da tavolo che combina davvero la semplicità delle regole con la bellezza della grafica e del gioco. Callisto affascinerà tutta la famiglia! Dai più giovani ai più anziani. E' un gioco veramente facile da apprendere (giusto una pagina di regole e immagini), ma dovrai usare tutta la tua abilità strategica per vincere. L'obiettivo del gioco è piazzare quante più tessere possibile sulla mappa prima che i tuoi avversari te lo impediscano. Callisto è veramente piacevole, c’è solo il rischio di non poterne fare più a meno; non stupirti se ti renderai conto di avere fatto quattro o cinque partite consecutive! Questo gioco è stato ideato dal più celebrato autore di giochi al mondo: Reiner Knizia, che ha vinto i più rilevanti premi mondiali, incluso l'importantissimo Spiel des Jahres 2008 in Germania. 

Contenuto:
1 Tabellone trasparente
3 Mappe da gioco inseribili
12 Colonne in quattro colori
72 Tessere in quattro colori
1 Libretto delle regole

Blokus-like, but the need to connect edges rather than corners makes a larger difference than I'd expected. Variable board size accomodates 2-4 players well. The once-per-game option for an additional starting point also adds tension.

What a great filler. Blokus clone that takes 3 minutes to teach, scales well 2-4, and plays incredibly quickly. Better than Blokus, allows players to play very aggressively against one another.

Shares some elements with Blokus, but Callisto is much more intuitive. It is very good and definitely not a copy ...

Very close relative of Blokus, not quite different enough to own both, which of course I do. But I do enjoy them both, Blokus a little more.

RATING: 5.5
Obviously a Blokus ripoff but with a few differences (mostly bad). Many of the pieces appear multiple times, so placement decisions are easier. Permissive edge adjacency is far too lax and makes both packing and blocking super easy, and players start from two seed positions which can be almost anywhere on the board.

However, what the game does add is the ability for a blocked-in player to drop a new seed somewhere on the board. As this wastes a turn it isn't super powerful, but it can help get someone flailing out of a spot, and I can see how this could be helpful in a family situation, even as it weakens the game.

My youngest (age 10), my wife and I play this together frequently.  Had this Reiner Knizia designed game long before I knew who the good Doctor was!  Now I know why I liked it so much.  Quite a few friends have bought this game after playing it with us.  It's a lesser known classic:)

nearly gave away, but we pulled out for a few plays inbetween games at west coast and it's a hit. Crucially, it uses pleasing soft plastic compared to Blokus' unhappy brittle bones.

upped to a 9 because we play and enjoy it so darned much

Here's the reason why Blokus has never quite captured my heart; a great "discount" shelf game cut from the same cloth as blokus except pieces touch side to side, and you use the placement of "columns" to decide where you start from, with each player holding a third column to deploy when they get boxed in. Like Ingenious, I love looking at the game while it's being played. My friend's four year old loves and it calls it "Fruit Chips".

The components are functional at best, and the whole package design is pretty basic and uninspiring. The German version introduces planetary backdrops, rather than the plain blue/white backing found in the U.K. version.

Colocar todas tus piezas en el tablero, respetando que deben estar conectadas ortogonalmente con otra de sus piezas o pilares. Cada espacio de pieza que no logres colocar da un punto negativo.

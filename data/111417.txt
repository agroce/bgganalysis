This game is notable one of the few  pick-up and deliver game that I do not actively dislike. I like this game because of how pure it is (literally there is nothing else to this game, although a lot of modules add variety to the experience) and because it does not overstay its welcome. I have tried Great Western Trail, I have tried Wasteland Express, and while I came away understanding that these might be someone's favorite games, I personally just didn't like them very much. This game is different in that I actually enjoyed playing it.

A nice little intro euro that's easy to transport. Feels like it ends a bit too quick though and the luck of the cards can be significant.

A straight forward pick up and deliver game I found at Pax a few years ago with a solid underserved trucker theme that has nothing to do with the meth trade. The game board consists of a series of cards you set up quickly and randomly which each represent a city with specific goods that can be picked up by your truckles (truck shaped meeples) and delivered to other locations for a profit. If you are looking for a less random, mechanically smoother, less involved pick up and deliver game than say, Merchants of Venus or Kings of Air & Steam than this is the game for you. It usually runs about 30 minutes and fits in a cargo pant pocket. I enjoy this game and would like to get it to the table more.

I can see how some would say that this is almost too luck-based, but the mechanics are simple and the rules make sense.  I enjoy pick-up-and-deliver, so I had a good time.  I look forward to trying it with the "inspansion" as the game seems a little dry without it.  Good length and box size.

Update: The "inspansion" is great.  Really gives the game some much-needed flavor.

A little ticket to ride combined with Pickup and deliver.  The game wasn't bad, I just don't care if I play it again.  Collecting the cards you need is pretty random and you can end up stuck with nothing to do.

It distills pick up and deliver down to a fun a little core. I think it's a neat game. Unfortunately, lots of people really dislike it one their first play because it feels too harsh and random. In some ways... it is.

But! Once you get used to the chaos and distribution of cards, I think the hand management gets a lot more fun. It's a good game with some very rough edges.

Cute and compact little pick up and deliver game.  It was one of the first games I was enamored with when I started into the hobby.  Because of this, it was one of the two games I took on my trip overseas to Ireland.  Has been eclipsed by many other games in my collection, but perhaps need to drag this one out for a go.

Neither too simple nor too complex, GHHC is a decent light game, especially for non-gamers. Not sure there's enough meat here for four players, or if the "advanced" sides of the cards and the "truck stops" are necessary, although they'll add some replayability if the game gets stale.

From this small box comes an awesome gaming experience.  This game defines how great a game can be even when packaged in a small box.  What's inside is a tight and fun pick-up and deliver game.  While its mostly a card game with hand management, there are options to make the route planning more interesting.  Careful planning and paying attention to your opponent's location and goods is key to good play.  If you want a game that is small and easy to carry just about anywhere and play at any time - this is the game.  It should be in every gamer's travel bag.

RATING: 8.5
The game is a joy, I love this simple simulation of shipping and picking up goods, with easy scoring and movement mechanics and cute bits. However, once you get accustomed to the basic rules, I HIGHLY recommend you use the 'Inspansion' stuff, as well as the variants provided in the rulebook, for an even deeper experience. One of the best Dice Hate Me games.

So much game in such a tiny box. My wife's favourite game and my favourite of the Kickstarter's I've backed (even amongst such luminaries as Flash Point and Resistance). Excellent with 2 or 3, very good with 4, 5 (KS 5th player expansion) suffers a little from downtime and randomness but still very playable. Multiple ways to increase game depth included in the box.

Biggest compliment I can give - while a different mechanic, has the closest 'feel' to a pocket Ticket To Ride that you can get. If Days of Wonder had published this with their name & marketing might I have no doubt it would sell 50000 copies (nothing against Dice Hate Me, their production is excellent - hopefully they'll get there in the end through word of mouth, it's deserved!)

It's like the designer distilled all the sweet agony of queue-barging, and pick-up-and-delivery, and poured it into a small box about trucking. It doesn't take much to spot the good routes to take, but being able to do them before people grab the resources you wanted is the trick.

Has a card element that drives how far you can move and and what goods you can pick up and sell, which makes the game what it is.

Card draws dictate the whole game, blocking is annoying, the entire "economy" is a broken non-sense mess.

Most of the time it seemed better to pay cash for gas than to muddle up one's hand with gas cards that always seem to get blocked.

I've always wanted to play a "Pick up & Deliver" game. So I was super excited to try this out. What I didn't realise until later is that Pick up and deliver is normally paired with some the most boring themes. But The Great Heartlands Hauling Co. is definitely not a boring themed game. There is a lot of tactics involved for a game that is pretty light on rules. You get the feel of a full board game with something that fits in a small box. another thing I liked is the choice of card stock. they're pretty thick and durable and will probably last a long time. well done game 7.5/10 would play again.

An enjoyable light, streamlined, quick filler pick up and deliver game with variable board set-up that has a small footprint on the shelf and is taught and learned easily. There could be some randomness with the draws, but it doesn't overstay it's welcome. 

There is enough game in the little box to hold your attention as a filler, but in the end, it's just a small fart without 'pant rupturing' potential. Nice theme and art.

 Rating is based on a two player game without the advanced variant which has variable player powers and could rise; although I doubt by much.

Demoed this with Jason (the game's designer) at Gen Con 2012.  Excellent little pick-up and deliver/hand management game.  The only issue we had with the game (all 3 of us) is that we occasionally would move some other player's truck instead of our own.  The truck beds are all the same color and make up 2/3 of the playing piece; only the cabs are shaded in the player color.  However Jason told us this wasn't going to be an issue after the next stretch goal was revealed, and sure enough they are wanting to include wooden truck meeples!

I'm now backing this on Kickstarter, and so should you! Bring on the Truckeeples!

This game delivers! A neat, quick strategy game that is light enough for families - but still has decisions to be made - even with the base game. The advanced version and 'inspansion' offer even more replayability and fun! For the size of the box, this game is stuffed full of goodness. Only complaint - colour coded cubes for scoring as well as thicker cardstock would have been nice touch. Pick it up!

This game surprised us. It does not look like much but looks can be deceiving. A fun pick up and delivery game that is great with non gamer's and gamer's alike. The Inspansion is cool but the players that spent money for the truck stop cards. Did not win because they spent their money. I guess if you aquired one early you could make better use of it.

I wasn't blown away, but I didn't hate it, either. All pick-up-and-deliver games are to one extent or another ruthless optimization puzzles, a genre at which I do not excel, but this reduced it to the bare essentials in a way I found a bit uncomfortable. But it;s small and sleek and portable and so likely to come up again and so I'm more than willing to give it another shot.

If you like pick up and deliver, you really should get this game. It's easy to learn. There are expansions included in the original box if you want more complexity. So far I have only played the base game, but I was really pleased with it. The "board" size is customized for the number of players, which is really nice. It allows for a two player game to still have the "getting in the way of each other" element more than a lot of other route building games that are for 2-4 players.

Players are driving trucks around the playing area, loading up goods, and delivering them for a profit.  Ultra simple pick up and deliver game.  The game is played on cards that represent "counties" - each one supplying one type of good and demanding two types of goods.  On a player's turn they must move their truck, by either discarding fuel cards, or paying $1 per space moved.  Then they must either load freight off the card they moved to; deliver freight to the card they moved to; or take a discard action to refresh their hand.  To load/unload you must play Bill cards of the matching goods, and unloading pays out according to the county card.  First to a set amount of money wins.  

Very nice, light game, with a little bit of thinking to do.  Some nice constraints are put on the players, such as blocking a county card (only one truck may stop on each card), and double Bill cards required for loading non-producing goods at a county.  Great compact packaging, nicely produced, alternate setup configurations, variant rules and an "inspansion" (ugh, that term) included in the game.

Fans of Ticket to Ride should check this out - they may like this one.

RATING: 6.5
I like the concept of this game. I'm not against blocking other players, but the way it's implemented in this game just feels to random to me. You don't even get the option of playing nice, because it's easy to unintentionally block the other player. If I'm going to block someone, I want it to be intentional.

A very basic pick-up-and-deliver game using cards as a substitute for a proper board.   The graphic design and bits were nice, although I'm not sure why the corn cubes were radioactive yellow.   Couple of interesting choices when it comes to movement rules, but overall a lot of artificial constraints are imposed on the system that don't really make any sense.   Looks like this is a Kickstarter that delivered on its promise, so that's good news.   Probably has a limited shelf-life, though, because, let's face it, delivering pigs, cows, corn and peas just isn't that exciting.

After 1st play:
I like it way better than Carnival (ok, not that that both games are any mean similar). It has plenty of randomness (every single thing you do, requires the right card) but I think I find it okay.

Even for a 5 players game (5th player pieces came from kickstarter strecth reward), it plays fast. Probably took somewhere around 20-25mins for the game to be over (all players were new to the game).

Regretted that I didn't back this on kickstarter. Again, this game is soo much better than Carnival.

Truck driver and the industry is near and dear to me. I think this is about the only game with that under utilized theme that I am aware of. Solid overall.

Very fun, compact, medium-light game.  I like the truck stop inspansion a lot (theme-wise especially), but am not convinced that going to a truck stop is ever beneficial int he long game.  There are lots of ways to slightly alter the game (with changing board layouts, etc.), which add something new each time we play.

This is a light pick up and deliver game that is actually about picking up and delivering goods.  The game is fairly simple as you will have 5 cards in your hand and use them either as fuel cards or goods.  You may pay money to move up to 3 spaces on the board or use your fuel cards to do the same.  

Once you move to a space, you can pick up goods if you have a manifest to pick them up.  Alternatively, if you have goods already and the good is in demand, you may use your manifest to deliver the goods for the price they are worth.  There can ever only be 8 goods at a location and the game ends when players earn either $30, 40, or $50 depending on the number of players in the game.

If you are unable to do anything, you may spend $1 to clear your hand and draw new cards or if you really can't do anything, you discard your hand and end up back at the distribution center.

The game only takes 30-45 minutes and really has allot of strategy in this small box as you can't stop on the same space as someone else, you need those different manifests to not only pick up, but also deliver goods, and if you want an advanced variant, the destinations are double-sided with routes blocked off so you have to go around an alternate route to get to your destination.  Also included is an "inspansion" which modifies the game as well.  For $20 or less, you really can't go wrong with this game especially if you want something to take with you on the road and is a nice game in a small box.

This is a pick up and deliver game, which is a genre I tend to like.  It's also a game with a reasonably short playing time and rules that work (though they aren't described very well in the rule book.)  On the other hand, I felt that I was playing mostly tactically.

The Great Heartland is a very bare-bones pickup-and-delivery game, and I suppose its small footprint and fairly short playing time are its main attractions. As a filler-type game it works fine. Of course, it is a very tactical game. The card draws rarely allow looking ahead by more than one turn, and random screwage certainly isn't unheard of. Nevertheless, for such a small package it packs a good punch, despite not quite reaching Japanese micro levels.

RATING: 8
Rating based on a prototype play back when this was set to be published by a different company. A neat little game that provides deeper gameplay than might seem on the surface with a decent method of mitigating the randomness of a card draw by giving the player multiple options on the modular board in a given turn to adjust their strategy based on what is available and what other players are doing as opposed to waiting for that perfect combination of cards to come along. It definitely does have that element, since, ultimately, this is a set collecting game. I suspect the rating will go up with the moderate tweaking the new publisher has put forth.

This is a very short attempt at a pick up and deliver game.  It's very much a card game and a lot depends on what you draw; this can be very frustrating if you need to move and aren't drawing movement cards or if you have a bunch of cubes and can't draw the right cards to deliver them.  Cute idea, but I'm not a huge fan of the execution. (1 play)

Played once with 4.  Perfectly acceptable lite-strategy game, but I was left wondering where the meat of the game was.  This will almost certainly see more plays due to the quick playtime and ease of teaching, so we shall see if my opinion improves (the Truck Stops might be necessary to beef up the game a little).

Update: Played with 3, seemed tighter than with 4.  Slightly better opinion of it the second time around.

Boy howdy, was this a painful play experience. I revisited the rules several times in hopes that I was missing something or playing it wrong somehow. It just felt so clunky and strained. I never had the cards I wanted or needed, I hate that I can't unload before moving, I HATE that I MUST move every turn, before I can take my action. It increases the game playing time, for little gain. It's NOT thematic to have to drive back and forth between two locations while you try to dig for the cards you need. I understand needing the cards to LOAD, but you should NOT need them to unload. The game is WAY too long for the box size. Overall, not happy with it and will likely trade it away.

I'm going to try a variant. You play the cards from your hand to the table in order to LOAD. Then when you UNLOAD you discard those played cards. Reduces luck and digging, increases pre planning. It is more thematic, as you show your freight bills to pick up your load, then you discard your freight bills when you make the delivery. 

As it stands, thematically, you are LOADing with your freight bills then you "lose" those papers, and spend your time driving around to different towns trying to "find" the papers you had but lost, so you can UNLOAD.

Pick up produce and sell it in different towns -- but the buying, selling and distances driven are all determined by the cards in hand... and it can get quite annoying when someone else is parked in the place you want.

I haven't played many "pick-up and deliver" games, but if they're all at least somewhat like The Great Heartland Hauling Co., I think I'm going to have a good time.  As for Great Heartland, what a neat idea.  From the building of the map to moving trucks around, loading and unloading product, it's just a lot of fun.  It's one of those games where you feel like it's going to take forever and then all of a sudden it's the end of the game.  It's a whole lot of management as well.  You can end the game, but if you've got a lot of product left in your semi, you'll probably lose due to the penalty.  It's a great little game.

Feels a lot like Istanbul, but with cards. I like having to juggle the cards for both buying and selling. Only tried 2 player, but even then there where possibilities for blocking, so could imagine it being even better with more. Turns are swift, only downtime is when choosing faceup cards, and flipping new ones to replace it. Cant wait to try the special abilities

Great little filler where the game naturally grows more challenging as it progresses. Since you are mostly dropping off at places that are not natural pick-up locations for those goods, purchasing gets more limited and challenging as you go. This facet actually gives this simple game a surprising need to plan multiple turns ahead. While there is quite bit of luck of the draw, you can leverage the face up draw cards effectively. Simply discarding can be the best move to position yourself for the final turns as long as you can at least partially leverage what is showing. Cool stuff.

Its portability is one of its greatest assets, which may or may not be a good thing depending on your point of view. GHHC offers the depth of a standard pick-up and deliver game in a small package, as it's easy to teach and understand. However it doesn't push the limits much of pick-up and deliver games - a genre that I'm not sure I've got the best of relationships to begin with. Solid but not groundbreaking.

RATING: 6
Pickup and delivery reduced to the bare minimum. Move the truck, either pickup or deliver goods, fill up your hand Ticket To Ride-style. The cards provide needed freight bills for the goods or fuel. The base structure is appealing, the art and its portability speak for doing a haul in the Heartlands. With four, it is very random. Chances are good that another truck randomly blocks your destination while needed cards never show up. Probably best with two.

CRITIQUE OF THE GREAT HEARTLAND HAULING CO.
Finally got in enough plays to give The Great Heartland Hauling Co. a proper critique. First, I have to say that, like Famiglia, GHHC has a box that is badly done. It is too small, and this is kind of annoying considering the fact that all the game is is cards and a few wooden pieces.

But that is my only complaint with this game. GHHC is a "pick up and deliver" game that plays quickly and offers plenty of opportunities for players to make difficult decisions along the way.

Gameplay is simple and straightforward: move and take one of three actions. You can either pick up goods, deliver goods, or get rid of your cards and draw new ones. The game is about making money, which can be used to move and to discard, but which also serve as your victory points at the end.

While it might sound like there is nothing to this game, there is a lot of horsepower under your truck's hood. If you want to just move around and do something on your turn, you can... but you will lose. To do well in GHHC you need to figure out a way to make the most of what you've got, and this means thinking three or four turns ahead. The small board, rather than making things easier, makes them much more difficult. Anyone could end up on the location you hoped to visit this turn, making you have to do something else entirely.

You won't really have the time or resources to go out of your way to play "take that" with your opponents, but it will happen anyway as you all compete for the same goods on the same small map. And as locations get filled up (there is a max of eight goods per location), it gets tenser still.

I have yet to play a game of GHHC in which I was not terribly frustrated by the terrible cards I'd draw into my hand. But this is a good thing, just as the frustration from bad die rolls is good in Settlers of Catan. This is because the game is all about improvising a decent back-up plan. This is what makes it fun; you always have to think on your feet. And once you get past the point where you know how to make a little money, you can even start thinking strategically about interfering with your opponents (to some degree).

While it isn't likely to break into my top ten, this is a game I am happy to play again and again. The only things I would wish for are higher quality cards and a better box.

Found this a lightweight but enjoyable pick up and deliver game.  This plays quickly.  Curious to try out the expansions in the future.  Paying to move can be annoying if you don't have the gas cards.  Blocking can be effective in this game as only one truck can be on a card so paying attention to what cards your opponents are picking up can be helpful.

A cute, quick little pick-up-and deliver game with a weird endgame situation. Namely, I was able to get to $40 on my turn, which ends the game, but I would lose, as I still had cargo on my truck that would penalize me below another player. So I would have had to actually penalize myself to keep from ending the game, by spending money on fuel instead of using the fuel cards in my hand. That's just weird. Probably better with some of the advanced variants.

Most games I play that are this light have that fun or at least thematic feel. This one doesn't, but it's still a decent travel game with little in the way of flaws. I am interested to see how the variants shape the game.

Easy, fun, card-based pick-up and deliver game stripped down to its most basic form.  The game moves quickly and has a nice balance of strategy and luck for a game of its length (the base game, at least).  The random setup and of course the fact that it is card-based should give the game a good bit of re-playability.  The alternate route variant should add some meat to what is already a very good game.  I was pleasantly surprised at how much this game offers, especially considering its small package and low price.

I bought this thinking a game with a trucking theme sounded cool.

My plays of it fell flat, for the following reasons:
-some of the rules felt a bit forced
-there didn't seem to be much sense of accomplishment

Anyway, I didn't think it was a bad game but it was one that I wasn't particularly eager to play, and none of my friends were excited about it either.

RATING: 7.5
This is a really simple but effective pick up and deliver game.  The super portable box, variable setup, and multiple game variations are a huge plus as well.  There is a luck factor, although you're usually drawing enough cards to avoid really getting stuck.  Getting blocked by another player can be frustrating and is the most confrontational point of the game, but it usually just results in getting less money rather than completely ruining a plan.

This is the best pick-up and deliver game I've ever played.  It's a very simple game to learn and a very fast game to play.  It sort of feels like an adult version of Tic-Tac-Toe, in that a two player mode is played on a nine tile block and is engrossing without requiring a lot of concentration.

Well designed game. The "random" layout of the game can give it replayability, but it seem like it will also break the game at times. I don't know, but it seemed like you could just do short hauls for the win. The game also sems to rely on actions of the player before you. I thinks games can be handed to the winner through missed opportunities to block.

Pick-up and deliver, modular board, optional rules to modify difficulty. Simple to teach. Turns are quick, with little downtime. Medium/High interaction, with resource competition and blocking.
Components are nice, but not spectacular. Colourblind friendly.

[b]The Great Heartland Hauling Co.(2013)[/b] was traded away with Las Vegas Boulevard, Sushi Go and Thunder Alley for Fleet/Fleet Arctic Bounty (with all KS rewards), Friday and Viva Java the Dice Game 12/29/14.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]This is a tough one for me to decide on. I thought I had found a small footprint and quick playing pick up and deliver game. We had tried Perry Rhodan and thought it was okay, then I played Great Heartland and really enjoyed it. Once it was reprinted I picked up a copy and I got it to the table a few times with my gaming group and a few times with my son. 

In the end I think it is an okay game, but I think it outstays its welcome. By the end I really just want the game to end, but you end up scratching and clawing your way to the finish and it feels quite anticlimactic because the winner has always been decided a few turns before the game actually ends.

I would play it again if asked, but in the end it didn't deliver. I'm still looking for a quick, small footprint PU&D game but haven't found it yet (both Perry Rhodan and Akrotiri also fell short).[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- An excellent pick up and deliver game that plays in about a 1/2 hour.
- Plays great with 2.
- Small footprint, would make an excellent cafe game.
- Plenty of meaty decisions to be made, feels like a full sized pick up and deliver game packed into a card game.
- You need to plan good routes since you can only pick up or deliver on each turn, and you have to move each turn.
- Great use of cards to create 2 currencies you need to manage (gas for movement and goods to pick up/sell goods).
- Variant map layouts depending on the number of players that really change how the game plays out.

This is exactly the quick playing pick up and deliver game I was looking for (Perry Rhodan: The Cosmic League didn't cut it).[/i]

RATING: 7
A lot of punch in a small packet. You either pay, or use cards, to travel to a location with goods, and then use cards in that good's colour to load them onto your truck. Refill your hand from a 3 card draft, hoping to draw more cards in that colour, as later on you'll want to move to a location where you're allowed to sell that good, but you'll need another card in that colour for each good to be able to sell it. The world isn't usually that immediately kind, so the game is all about the choices of what to load, how far to travel and when to offload based on the cards that come, making for lots of choices throughout the game in the search for efficiency. First to make enough money to hit the money target wins. The interaction comes in jumping on somewhere someone wants to go (one truck only per space), even if accidentally, which forces continual change of plans and decision making, but doesn't introduce any significant downtime - a nicely toed line. It comes in at a good time length for a pick-up-and-deliver game, so there's a lot to like.

Light, Quick, Clever Pick-Up and Deliver Card Game. I love the theme and the ties to farming commodities. Portable. Should be enjoyed by men and women, all ages, and gamers and non-gamers alike.

Good first successful game for Jason Kotarski.

Graphics by Christopher Kirkman and Brian Buckley. I hope the finished map card tint won't be so pink-ish, but perhaps that will help the appeal for women.

Initial impressions after one play:
Seems largely luck-based, as the cards you get determine what you do on your next turn.
The players who drop off their goods first to the valuable spots can runaway with the game, as the spots are now essentially unavailable to the rest.

RATING: 8
Based on one play: This goes to show that a small box can hold a fairly deep game. The mechanics are simple, buy goods from one location with cards and then use the same cards to sell the goods at other locations. You also have cards that are used to move around and locations can hold a maximum of eight goods, as can you truck. Seems simple and it is, but it works well as you race to find the right combination and movements but always seem to be missing the right cards. There are also various setups and options to keep it fresh.

This is a simple pick-up-and-deliver game where you move your truck pawn around a board made of cards, picking up and delivering resource cubes.  It's pretty simple, and there is a good bit of luck with card draws--you need to turn the cards in to pick up or deliver the goods.  Blocking is a thing too, though often it's not deliberate.  Despite all this, I quite enjoyed this game, and look forward to trying it with the advanced rules.

I like the cute design but it feels a bit sluggish and slow. You can burn yourself by loading too many pigs (or cattle) because the pig/cattle cards are rare (8 per sort). So you can load in a lot — if you have the right cards — but you might not be able to unload them at all (in a three player game). Feels like a super tight efficiency puzzle. Maybe I expected more than there's to this game. I always feel that this should play fast and smooth, yet it feels slow and cumbersome. I like that there are variable setups and the add-on cards look nice, but I might never play them. This game might get traded away after a couple more plays.

The Great Small pick up and deliver game, as I have renamed it. You can pick up the game with your one hand and deliver it to the table. Game companys take note; you only need a box only the size to fit the game! The game itself is as pick up and deliver as it gets, the only difference is that you can acuqire abilities that allow you to bend the rules. That's it. Unremarkable but functional. That's what some people want. If it was a 10-15 minute game I would agree, but at 30-45 mins I'd rather invest my time in something more fun. Despite that, if you manage to make your delivery it is satisfying and blocking others from delivering is fun. The Great Small Pick up and deliver game only problem is that it doesn't pack any ambition.

Didn't make the cut, as the game doesn't deliver enough joy.

Enjoyable pick up and deliver game, a genre I like. Like the theme on farm commodities and the truck meeples. Seems to be mostly tactical, you are dependent on what cards are coming up. 

Played 2 player several times - The alternative map layouts are more interesting as well as playing with the obstruction side, makes the map and the movement a bit more variable.
The restrictions of 8 commodities and 2 trucks cannot coexists adds a light screwage factor. 

Pleased that I Kickstarted it.

RATING: 5.1
First impressions: Not a horrible game, but there is not much here. It will fill a niche for me to play something quick with my kids, but not much more. Very limited choices on your turn. You move, by playing fuel cards or spending money, pick up resources or sell resources that you have for the most money possible by playing matching cards, or spend $ to discard.

If another player is on a space you want, you just go to the next most valuable space. It comes down to taking your most valuable move each turn, which is alway obvious since you can only move 1, 2, or 3 spaces.

It's a game where you hope to win because your opponent does not make the best moves available. If all players make the most valuable move every turn, it comes down to luck of the draw and turn order.

Great graphic design, and original theme, but the gameplay did not leave us wanting more.  I had high hopes, as I really love other Dice Hate Me Games, and am a big proponent of indie game designers, but in all honesty the game is just "meh".

I will play it again with the "inspansion" to see if this kicks it up a bit. 

I don't think it is a candidate for me to pull out at game night with my gamer friends.

Tahiti is a much better light, pick up and deliver option.

I played one game of this back in 2013 when we were looking for a quick game to finish the day and this was the only one anyone had with them. The owner had kickstarted it, I believe, although for me the game wouldn't have been worth the expense. It was a decent enough way to spend 40 minutes or so, but I saw nothing special about the game to warrant requesting future plays (although I would never object to this either). The result seemed to be largely a matter of luck in drawing the right cards (or having them face up and available) at the right time, although I suspect more plays might reveal some strategic principles.

Not a bad game by any means but it just felt a little redundant to us. Also it lasted a little long for what it is. I wish the cards that are used for the playing board were tiles instead. Rating based on 2 players. Haven't tried the Truck Stop expansion yet, it may change the rating.

Hm.. Not in love. Need further plays.

2nd play was better, still find some design decisions a bit weird and it's been way too long on both of my plays. However I am keeping it because the Theme is super cool.

3rd play: I'll keep it cause the Theme is uber cool but am not enamored. The system is very simple and repetititive. I'll try the expansions next game and see if that changes anything.

I put in the work that I needed to. Pick up and deliver hasn't excited me in any game that I have tried to date. So my score is totally subjective to my personal taste. I can see other folks enjoying this little game. Brings a lot of modularity to keep things fresh and try out different set ups.

Finally had a chance to give this one a try.  Fun, light filler - but - not just a mindless pick up and deliver...even if you are just picking up and delivering. Tried out on a game night when just two of us showed up and it was a great way to finish up the evening.  This will definitely stay in the game bag.  Based on the initial play, I can see that scalability shouldn't be an issue, even with adding in the 5th player expansion.

Looking forward to giving it another try - and checking out the truck stop and Badlands expansion.

I purchased this game to play with my friend's husband, a former long haul truck driver.  I wasn't sure the pick up and deliver mechanic would be something I would enjoy but the good reviews, cheap price tag, and small footprint made it an easy buy.  Our friends enjoyed it and although I didn't do very well, I really liked it also.  Lots of game in a small box!  I think this one will see lots of play.

Who says the middleweight game is dead? This was awesome, a great little pick-up-and-deliver game with just enough arc that it can be worth it to try and get some of the super-bonuses. Your limited carrying capacity and the fact that other players can block locations creates the tension to make each decision both challenging and rewarding. The hand management is difficult, as you need the same cards to both buy AND sell goods.

RATING: 4
Ugh, this game just plays itself and is based on complete luck of the draw.

In the game a map is made up of cards in the center of the table with resources on the different spaces.  Each player takes turns moving about the map and either picking up or dropping off goods for money (your points in this game).  But your hand decides your decisions for you since you need to discard cards of the matching type to either pick up or drop off goods.

All of that just makes the game boring and uninteresting but it can get so much worse.  End up with a pile of a specific good in your stock and no cards to discard them and you can spend turn after turn hoping to get lucky with the card draw.

All in all this game attempts to be a quicker, simpler, smaller clone of Ticket to Ride...which it is but it is also more boring, less fun, and less interesting.

RATING: 8.5
Straight up - this game is brilliant.  It takes everything that is good and fun about pick-up-and-deliver games and distills the elements into the tightest little package you could possibly imagine.  Several things about the game (from the card-based "board", to the picking up of goods to sell at specific locations, to the race to reach a certain amount of money, to the ability to spend victory points in order to purchase vehicle upgrades) bring to mind "Perry Rhodan: The Cosmic League" (which is a huge compliment from me, considering the esteem in which I hold that great game).  But at the same time, between the higher player count, the greater variability in board movement, and other little elements, Heartland ends up feeling quite different than, but just as fun as, Perry Rhodan.  The mini, in-game expansions of the more difficult routes and the truck upgrades also add some very fun twists to the game, without changing it drastically.  It's quite a good thing that the most personally annoying part of the whole game is that they would give such a long and cumbersome title to such a small and beautifully streamlined little gem of a game!  Game design: 4.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 4/5  Total: 8.5/10

Good thing I'm not a card sleever - that box is TIGHT. It doesn't allow a lot of options for arranging components - just putting all the contract/fuel cards in one stack is too tall for the insert and the cards can slide around. I'll have to be careful with the bag for the cubes, since I don't think I own another bag that would actually fit in the box if I had to replace it. Hmmph. I hope it plays well. (Haven't tried it yet.)

NOTE: After trying the game, it seems to be a decent quick little game, but the enjoyment is actively harmed by the tiny location cards - they are hard to read, especially after loading them up with cubes. This game is seriously marred by the stinginess of its components.

[Dice Hate Me Games 14 Edition] {Truck; pick-up-and-delivery; optimal 3p}  The Great Heartland Hualing Co is a solid card game.  Players move their truck around the map to pick up cargoes and deliver them to other locations.

Player interaction is good but it depends much on game setup.  And, the games look slow with 4p...

Variants:
+ Short Haul: Good one - the game is more interesting with 4p.
= Fresh Start: just make it more refreshing.  It doesn't add tactical depth to the game.
+ Warehouse mix-up: better set-up.  The game is more dynamic and tense.
++ Alternate route: Good one.  Now the game is more vibrant, cash is more tense and blocking is more fierce. Better interaction.

Nice light pick up and deliver game with the most literal translation of pick up and deliver possible. Enjoyable, although my only concern would be that any player who likes to calculate could spend a lot of time working out the most efficient route, and this would kill this game stone dead.

A light, fairly inoffensive card game. The artwork is great. The base game is pretty unsatisfying after a couple plays.

The time and money required to power up sets the player back too much to make it worth while, and if that's really the case then why have them?

Dull, boring and pretty unfun, which is a dire comment for a game. If you are going to use a mechanism like pickup and deliver which has been done to death, and isn't that interesting to start with, you need to offer something new or different. This game is neither of those things. The theme is barely there, the game is repetitive, the choices are fairly obvious. E.g. Do the best thing you can afford. Sorry to dump hate on this game, but it just didn't work for me.

RATING: 6
A simple pick-up-and-deliver game that appears straightforward but has a few emergent properties during game play that is not evident in the rules. Players pick up four types of goods to deliver to various cities demanding these goods. Trucks move from one location to the next to pick up or deliver goods. Simple enough?
    A few restrictions make this game feel a lot more complex than it reads. First, trucks can either pick up or deliver and not both and no two trucks can occupy the same city. This can really mess up your plans, especially unloading cargo. Delaying a round to deliver may work only if you have the right cards at hand for an alternate move which is usually not efficient or optimum. Next, having a maximum of 8 goods per city restricts what you can drop off. Even though some cities pay a premium for goods, due to the restriction, you may not be able to sell the goods in the city. This prevents players from slowly collecting high value goods only to sell them at the right moment. There is now a risk as you may not be able to sell it at where you want to sell it. These restrictions really turns the game into something more than just a simple pick up and deliver. It makes the game fun and frustrating at the same time. One annoying flaw in the game. The tableau for drawing cards can get stuck with goods no one wants and there is no incentive to pick them up later in the game. So players end up drawing blindly from the main deck instead of selecting from face-up cards. Often, low value goods like corn or soy are tough to deliver later in the game as cities can no longer accept these goods due to the 8 good restrictions. Also, this game is perfect for 2. With more, I think the game will drag and the turns will be slow. There is also very little interaction between players during each turn.

   For the price, the game carries good value for the casual gamer. However, for the serious gamer, I am not sure there is enough variety or replayability to sustain their interests.

Pick-up-and-Deliver, where you get to choose your own source and destination cities (rather than  fixed by a contract card) based upon supply and demand designated for each city.  

Another distinction is that a matching product card is required for each loading and unloading action.  Also a fuel consumption mechanism for movement.

VERY compressed map. As few as 9 nodes (3x3) for two players, and 12 for four (somewhat cross-shaped).

I kickstarted this game because I am an ex-trucker and the theme was appealing. The game is light, but there is quite a chunk of strategy and you have to constantly adjust your play based on what the other players did during their turn. There is a good part of random due to the draw of cards, but if you add the home-made rule that you can unload 1 cube for 3 differents good cards (instead of 1 of the type of the good), it alleviates it by a lot.

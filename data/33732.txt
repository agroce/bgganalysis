I could easily see myself giving this game a higher rating if I felt like I understood it better. Unfortunately, my first play of it was cut short before the end and I didn't quite get to see how the end would actually work itself out. 

It's a sort of cryptic market manipulation game complete with an action selection system. I felt like I was doing okay with it... but I spent pretty much the entire game selecting the same action over and over again. I could tell that I was manipulating the market somehow--possibly in my favor. I had a plan to make some money. 

It's worth exploring what is really going on beneath the surface of this game. But I'm not sure that it's good?

Thematically Tulipmania offers something different and interesting.  However, I feel that it fails to convert that promising material into an interesting game.  

There simply don't seem to be enough realistic choices; you are always constrained by money and by the importance of matching your tulips to buyer cards to avoid standing at the wrong end of the queue for payouts when the bubble bursts.  I won my last game through two forced moves that triggered sellouts for the final three colours.  Perhaps I did well to get into that position or the other players were fools to let me, but it didn't feel very satisfying.

The JKLM production is not great with thin cards and purple and (dark) blue easily confused. The rules could have been clearer on one or two points.

RATING: 5.5
Decidedly dull and lacking in depth, even the components are not great (although this does not usually count against a game). Limited strategy which relies a lot on the luck of the draw and where the "tied action winner" card is. Lost interest quite quickly and finished the game early by speculating at the end.

When I first heard that Scott Nicholson had a game, I was intrigued.  Then I found out more about it, and I was less excited.  Now I've played it, and it's not bad.  It's really quick, and though I don't have a hold on the strategy (and am not particularly interested in tracking down a copy), I'm definitely interested to try again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Only one play, so early days, but I'm not sure how much control exists here.  Certainly trying to predict what the other players are likely to do, and using their actions to your benefit is crucial.  But whether that is actually (reliably) possible, I'm not yet sure.  Not so much of a problem with the colours as I had been expecting from all the dire comments around.  Very interesting mechanics, and a very good fit to the theme.

Belatedly came to this game. The production issues mentioned elsewhere are a shame because this is a very decent game of manipulating the market and other players, with plenty of tension, especially when it boils down to which of the final two tulips will fetch big bucks before crashing.

RATING: 5
The idea of the Bubble market is good indeed, but in my opinion the price for paying others to buy or speculate is too high because the cards come too slow in the game. So paying 1 or 2 cards is too much. This could have been worked out better. Regretfully the whole game stands by this tecnique.

First play:  Initial observations, the cards are the main engine of this game but the quality is decidely poor. If a group were to play this extensively then sleeves would be essential.

Colour separation and selection is dire, blue and purple are so close as to cause regular confusion unless direct comparison is made, and the brown on brown numbers on some of the cards is just downright design incompetance. 

The money consists of coloured paper notes. Starting money is supposed to be 700 florins with 5 x 100's and 8 x 25's. Unfortunately the game only comes with 24 x 25 notes so the bank will run out with 3 players and not be able to cope with 4 or 5.

Considering JKLM took a year to release this, there appears no excuse for such flimsy build quality and poor design..

Game end left me and the group feeling somewhat cold. There doesn't seem to be much to it and the reports of a bluffing experience seem out of step with the reality of the game. Tulips held are open and a player with a decent memory can see what buyer cards are picked up, so a player's hand is pretty much declared. The lottery of what buyer cards turn up seem a major factor in what could be 1000's of florins difference in the final scores.

I struggle to see how a game could last the suggested 60 minutes in any but the most AP prone of groups. We learn't the rules and played  'carefully' and polished game 1 off in 40 minutes.


I think I need to play again to give this one a fair chance but owing to the initial feeling that this is a quick and shallow game, I have little compulsion to do so. Very disapointing after such a long wait on almost every measurable level.

On reflection I would rather play 96% of my collectiuon rather than suffer this again. Sold on E-Bay.

A very interesting stock market game that I am just beginning to get my head around. There are so many things to consider that the decisions are enjoyably difficult.

One mild irritation is that you absolutely have to be in on the first colour to burst. If not, things become very difficult as everyone else now has far more money than you.

A very wacky stock manipulation game, especially for 3p.  The game seems to be so tight (i.e., tight money, crazy price fluctuation, forced sale of one of your precious tulips each turn, and fearing or knowing that opponents have run out of cash) that it's busting at the seams in the sense that if you make one false step, then you might just ruin your chances of winning and end up handing the victory to an opponent.  Rather stressful and brainy, but to the point that it was more work and worry than fun.

Only played it once, so I don't think it is fair to rate it yet as I'm sure it is a game that needs a play or two to work out what you should do (proxy cards for example seem a really really bad idea most of the time, because you don't get the item and burn a valuable buyer in the process).

I need to play this again before making up my mind. Played it 3 times and still not sure ... I feel I should like it, but currently don't, and I'm not sure why - perhaps I'm missing something or looking for depth that isn't there? Very colour blind unfriendly :( I can't distinguish between blue and purple at all, and red/orange are very close too (I collected the wrong one last game by accident, grrr).

RATING: 7
A nice super-filler economic game, as in my experience, the game plays in a half hour or so rather than the 60 minutes printed on the box!

I thought the game presented some decent decisions for a game of it's briefness, and I'm always a sucker for economic games so I enjoyed it quite a bit.  You'll of course be trying to pump the value of tulips you own, which is a bit tricky since you're also trying to match up your tulip holdings with the color of buyers in your hand.  Pumping something and then not having buyers can be fairly devastating.  Of course, you also hope for a little help from the other players along the way, as there's no way to do anything yourself!

It's really too bad this game got such an awful graphic and production treatment.  The colors and presentation are so poor as to make legibility a real issue.  Some numbers just blend right into the background, and some of the colors are way too similar to tell apart without a second look.  Very amateur hour.

However, the game is solid and a very unique take on the stock market theme, but thematically and mechanically.

I LOVE Scott Nicholson’s video reviews; they were among the first ones I saw and really got me into this wonderful world of board games. However, just because Scott is a great video reviewer doesn’t mean he is necessarily a good game designer – and this was, unfortunately, true as I didn’t like Tulipmania at all… 

Granted, it was very late when we played, and 3 of us had never played before, so it dragged on too long because we didn’t understood that we are actually playing against the other players and not the game itself! And I think that’s my main gripe with Tulipmania; there isn’t really any game to be found in here. It’s just some tedious stock speculation. Also, the game takes a long time to really get going, but once the first bubble has burst the gameplay speeds up significantly as most players suddenly have lots of cash in hand which, to me, felt a little weird. Also, the player or players who didn’t sell any of the tulip which bursts first are severely handicapped throughout the rest of the game I think. Admittedly, I only played it once, but it was the general consensus among all of us including those who had played before. Unfortunately, Tulipmania was a rather dull experience which I’m highly unlikely to play again!

Surprisingly fun and effective little speculation game. Well researched by the designer, and although the design for the money is a little... childish... the tulip meeples can easily double as Pac-Man ghosts, so it all balances out. It might have been nice to see bulb breeding to try and create hybrid strains, increase prices but at a risk, but I suppose that would probably require a major mechanical addition.

Tentative rating since I still cant quite grasp how to win this game. But maybe thats the point. In a rising market buying anything will make you money, as long as you can bail before the bust. But your ability to control price rises is limited. From that perspective this is a very good simulation.
I did find though that the "win ties" card was quite critical since the ability to out bid for a good tulip is not available because the price is set by the board. That is, while having the appearance of an open market, its only an illusion and instead you're just taking turns to buy/speculate based on the position of the tie-break card. I found that quite frustrating.

Played 1 5er game.  Interesting stock-market/economic game where you are trying to buy into a color (of tulips) and manipulate the market to get that color to go higher.  Some interesting mechanisms, but I'm not sure how much strategy is in this one.  Maybe this could go up w/more plays, but I think it's going to stay a 6.

Fun market manipulation game that took a few plays to grok. Like actual markets, the outcome and fun are dependent on who you play with and their style of play. We tended to play very quickly, driving prices up in few turns. This led us to wonder what happens when the third tulip bursts in a 4 player game when the 4th player had yet to get their sixth buyer card. Did they simply miss out on their last card? Rules weren't clear, and we couldn't come up with a reasonably fair house rule. Component issues have been well discussed, but I found them frustrating too.

As an economic sim of a bubble, this is very good. As a game, I struggle to see how to succeed, but that could be my failing. You all start from an equal position, except for the three random buyers. The money goes round a bit between players, until a proxy sale brings cash into a player. At this point, I lose grasp on explaining it. The game seems to slide along (much like a bubble would) but this doesn't feel like a game, but more like an exercise in economics. After a while, and the game is quick, a colour hits the top of the plan and somebody wins big and somebody (me) misses out massively. Which left me trailing badly and unable to recover. 

So I cannot tell if I liked the game, but it really did not feel like a game to me. That may simply be because I don't recognise what is going on, and players that enjoy economic games will eat this up. But it passed me by.

The graphic design is quiet gloomy, with some colours being too close and all too dark and shadowy. The cardstock seems very flimsy and prone to getting bent.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.8
Speculation in a bubble market (in this case tulips), is a great economic theme for a game.  This is a very tricky game,  because a player has to anticipate what their opponents are going to do.  A lot of info is public: the tulips, money, and the number of cards. Soooo, with that info, what are they going to do?  At what point will they stop buying recklessly, & will you be ready for the sell off as prices plummet?

I tend to get involved with my items & actions, and don't concentrate on the others players--this is a weaknesses of mine in games.  Being off in your own little world in this game will not bring a win your way--do Ricochet Robots for that.

I have started sleeving cards where a player gets a small hand that is played over & over (as in this game), because when the cards get worn, the secret choice isn't so secret any more. So this is an extra expense.

The blue buyer cards can be confused with the purple ones--and the market is all about color.  There is not enough money to distribute in the denominations as the rules direct.  

Rules are nicely written & illustrated, and are easy.  The game plays in half an hour or less.  Nice tulip components.

My rating of a 7 might come down with more plays, but for now, it is a very challenging game for me & I am looking forward to more plays.

Hey I won my first game yesterday (13-Nov-2009).  6th play of the game.  I still do not feel that I have any sense of a good strategy for this game, but I do know how to tell if I am making a very good decision on my turn now.

I enjoy playing this game and love that it is quick too.  We often play this game at lunch time at the office.

It also surprises me how ignorant I was about the real Tulipmania.  I have met people that knew all about this bubble market.  I never heard about it until the game came out.

I think the game is under valued.  It's actually a pretty good game.

Tuplimania is a pure stockmarket game with simple rules, yet you need to play most of a game to actually grasp the implications of the player actions. For such a short game it manages to pack quite a punch. At the same time it's also rather dry and abstracted, and often feels more like you're simply jockeying for position on the board instead of speculating because one of the available commodity types will end up relatively worthless while the others pay out a lot of money, and having the power to decide which bubble is going to burst is rather important.

Nice first game by a renowned game reviewer. The only downside (if that) is that you only go through a single "burst" rather than a cycle of boom and busts which I originally expected. So, no sooner have you got your strategy sorted out, than the game comes to a sudden end.

Unfortunately, the failure of the publisher to deliver a quality print production means that the game rates lower than it might otherwise do. Scott even mentions the problems in his podcast on the game. He deserved better for his first game.

I wanted to really enjoy this game, but found it just an 'ok' game.  I really couldn't get a feel for the timing and it seemed like you had 'some control' over it, but where much more at the whim of the board.  All that being said, I guess that's the point of 'speculation'.  It should play fairly quickly with experience, so it might end up seeing more play then I expect.

A reasonable simulation of a bubble economy, but like a real bubble it depends on someone else being a 'mug' and spending their resources to boost the value of a commodity that you're interested in. Among players of similar ability that just isn't going to happen, so there really isn't a game here. All the action takes place in the end of game crashes, with everything else being a mechanical prelude that's very hard to relate to thematically. An easy game to win without knowing why as there's a huge chaos factor in the play. With family in The Netherlands, I wanted to like this, but it's an idea that just doesn't work.

This is a pretty weird little stock game, but I like it.  It moves quickly and the values of the tulips can be very volatile.  There is certainly opportunity for manipulation of the market, but you have to be careful about when and how you do it, because it's very expensive and the tulips are pretty scarce.  I'd like to play this more; it's not as easy to find opponents as I'd like.  (2 plays)

Interesting economic game which just seems to provide a basic framework, and thereafter really leaves players in charge of how the game is going to progress. Slightly reminiscent of games like Container or Chicago Express in that respect.

Best with 5, OK with 4. Not very interesting with 3.

Rating is provisional given that our first play got a couple rules wrong.  I can't imagine this game not landing somewhere around a 7:  a good game, but not one I'll go out of my way to play.

The market volatility is interesting.  In our play we struggled to see the incentive to speculate a market to the top though.

I'm worried the buyer cards will seem like more of an annoyance after more plays - I tend not to enjoy random restrictions to the decision space.

I like the theme in general, but I can't help thinking that the fact everyone knows it's a bubble doesn't simulate a bubble very well.

RATING: 5
This looks like such a good idea, and the mechanics are easy enough to grasp.  The problem is that understanding the chaos is analogous to, well, timing a market.  It seems impenetrable.  If there is a strategy to manipulating the market well, none of our group could see it.

RATING: N/A
A game of market manipulation thematically reflecting the speculative bubble/burst of Dutch tulip trading during the early 1600s.  I'll have to set this on the back burner for now, too many other un-played games.

RATING: 7
This is a neat little game based on the world's first bubble market. Manipulating the market and riding the bubbles can be fun though my group is less enthused about it than I am.

Tulipmania is an economic game stripped down to its bones - and being dry as a bone which is not necessarily a turnoff. In its austere structure it resembles Winsome titles like Chicago Express or SNCF but it lacks their refinement up to the state of being underdeveloped. Tulipmania needs a play or two to dig what's happening. Even considering the short playing time of 45 minutes, it will be a hard sell to get it on the table repeatedly and reach the point where the game gets interesting, i.e. all players know what they are doing. With inexperienced players the game is approaching meaninglessness as the "play the players game" known from Chicago Express just won't happen. The components don't help here with their form over function principle. Be sure that there will be colour confusion between blue and purple. I'll rather put the effort of building up a knowledgeable player base into King of Siam or Chicago Express where I expect a higher payoff.

RATING: 4
The early game is nickle-and-dime action that's tedious beyond belief.
That early stage continues until somebody gets bored and spends one of
their precious cards on injecting some liquidity into the system. After
that the rest of the game pretty much plays itself out with a random
player winning (probably not the one who had to waste a card to start
it off).

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Tulipmania seems like a pretty fragile game that would be more rewarding with more plays.  Because of the theme and mechanics, players automatically assume that they're supposed to hoard one color or two and unload at the right time.  The game seems to be much more subtle than that, which can be frustrating for players with different expectations.

I think that with further play I would enjoy this more, but I'm not sure that I'll find willing participants.  I like the quick play time and simple rules, but the components are not really the greatest.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Its hard to describe what I don't like about this game. Firstly, the theme is just disconnected and I noted most players (including myself) totally disinterested after the first round. It was very hard to get into the spirit of the game.

The 5 Actions didn't quite make sense and it was extremely hard to follow the cause/effect. Also, I feel the game is decided very early, when players choose the tulips they are supporting. If you happen to be lucky to choose a tulip color which matches other players then you have a major advantage.

RATING: 5
Quick economic auction game. Deciding which tulip to offer for auction, which card(s) to use during the auction and which tulip to buy in anticipation of a future bubble are the main elements of the game. Speculation without much control. First play was interesting, but I don't see much replay value.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
With very limited number of cards you have very little room to maneuver on your turn, which makes the game very undynamic and dry. There are lots of better stock speculation games out there so its hard to see why I'd pick this over some clearly better competitors (Spekulation, Modern Art, Freitag, Hab & Gut to name a few).

All JKLM Games have subpar components & graphics design and Tulipmania is unfortunately no exception

Surprisingly annoying experience. This one is a dull and more like math-excercise than a "game". You've too limited set of buyer-cards which limits your action possibilities too much. And when it comes to game components... JKLM has made it again. 

Really tried to like this - and I've even played this more than once - (and was waiting for the chance to play it) but I've to admit that there are a way better one stock manipulating games.

RATING: 5
Initial rating. It's not bad but I could name some better stock market games, even if this mechanism is quite fun for the theme. And in the end it boils down to player order and lots of luck, it seemed. (I'm not complaining as a loser; I was 2nd of the 4)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
First play proved interesting enough that I want to try again.  Interesting stock market simulation in which one speculates on the market but can also have proxy buyers interact dependent on your buyer cards.  However, using your buyer cards in such a way can lead to lower returns when selling tulips down the road...

A pleasingly unique economic game that simulates the types of speculations that go on within a bubble market. The rules are ingenious and original, and while there's nothing particularly stellar about the artwork, it does exhibit a very charming coherence of style. I found it hard to figure out anything whatsoever about strategy on a first play; in retrospect, I think this is because the business of moving left to right on the board, while crucially important to determining who ends up with the most dough, is also the game's one major departure from realism, since it doesn't seem (to me at least) to represent any real-life phenomenon of the marketplace.

RATING: 8
The Dutch tulip craze is an unusual theme for a very unusual game.  It took me awhile to understand, but after playing with five players it finally began to make sense.  As Scott says in his video, you are the "smart money" in the tulip business; the buyer cards represent other potential buyers in the market, or as I refer to them, "suckers". They will take your advice and help to push the market up, but you must discard them when they buy.  You must use them carefully, or you will miss them when their tulip colors peak and then crash.  The game is not easy to learn or teach, but it is very rewarding when the players "get it".  A successful modeling of a bubble market is quite an accomplishment!

A ghastly colour scheme and general low-rent production values are disappointing, but there is much more here than the game's rating would suggest.

Stock market manipulation boiled down to a price-crazy core. You sell one of your goods. The other players simultaneously reveal their intentions for it - pass, purchase, speculate. If all pass, the stock tumbles a price level and you don't get much. If someone buys, you get the current price and the market notches up but on the same price level. If someone speculates, you get more money and the prices jumps up big time 1 level. Then you pick up a buyer card, the intention being to match up a good with a buyer card in the stocks that other people are collectively interested in getting the price to the very top level, so as to max your cash. You simply can't do it by yourself. My one time was with 4 players and it all seemed simply too hard to assess which stock was going to make it to the top - and then to keep the card / stock combinations through consequent turns. With only 1 sale each turn, in a game where you need cash for further investment, it seemed the default decision was to simply sell whatever was highest, get the cash, but occasionally causing quick price crashes. Which meant it got chaotic. And with big price differentials between the levels, the final result seemed pretty random. Benefit of the doubt and all, I'm sure there's smart ways to play and it's not nearly as random as it seemed, but I wasn't enamoured enough with the mechanism on a first time playing to search it out for replay.

RATING: 5
Maybe I didn't really get this game, or maybe my expectations were off.  What I expected was a game about investing in a bunch of markets and getting out before they crashed.  That's not what happened though--having lots of tulips in a crashed market was still plenty valuable, even if you didn't have any buyers.  It really just turned into a game of Old Maid--try not to be the guy who invests in the tulip that doesn't crash at all, because the payouts on that were way worse than the post-crash payouts.  Not really what I was looking for.

Tulipmania is a market manipulation game that I found difficult to get to grips with on the first play but would like to play again to see if there's something good there. It had a similar feeling to Chicago Express of being very sensitive to the players and the group-think. The problem with that type of game is that you really need to have a group of players who are prepared to play repeatedly and work out the subtleties.

RATING: 8
Takes a few games to grok which actions have which underlying implications and how these influence others. Once everyone at the table 'gets it', the game moves up to the next level and becomes a taught brinksmanship game where playing the other players is just as much part of the game as playing the tulip market. Good fun in an hour.

Another example that a good critic does not make a good author. Tulipmania is incredibly boring and brainy, pretty much like playing pong on a calculator. There is number crunching without the excitment of a stock market and is incredibly easy to "solve" the game and use the right tactics as they options to influence/sabotage the other players are way too limited to make a game in which the players are so interdependant interesting. Take a horrible theme and terrible artwork and you have yourself a crappy game.

Tentatively rated a 7 after one play. I do not yet understand how to play this game well, but I liked the mechanisms.

A neat (and quick) game about market manipulation.  It's not complex, but the subtleties of how the actions work can feel that way at times.  In the end, I'm not sure how much the game is random vs. strategic, but I enjoyed the experience and found the whole thing delightfully weird.

I think it is probably best with 4.  5 dilutes your own turns, which reduces agency.

Tulipmania feels very much like Knizia game in a sense that it concentrates on a certain mechanic which is after one game very strange indeed.

Despite being designed by Scott Nicholson, and rated as his number one game of 2009, I wasn't a big fan after playing it twice. It was interesting but I didn't do well at all the first time because of the variation of the card colours.. what I thought was blue (cause it looked blue) wasn't really blue but purple and I had a collection of blue tulips which of course did me no good combined. :-(  I wouldn't mind trying it again but it's currently nowhere near my top ratings.

I found the economic system of this game to be quite interesting.  Early on, it looked as though the game were going to be rather dull.  Then the bubbles began to burst, resulting a headlong rush to the end.  I find that I like the steady early build-up.  I really like the mad-dash rush as the end.  I was afraid that after the initial rush, the game would fall back into a slow build.  Alas, there is way too much money out there for this to happen.  In a sense, it is similar to Acquire in that you definitely want to be in on the early money-making plays.  In this case, it seems you want to be in on the very first in order to have some liquid capital.  In retrospect, the early positioning was quite important and we all saw how we would do things differently.  All in all, a very enjoyable excperience that I would be happy to repeat. [01/01/2010]

This is a highly distiller pure stock market game.  It really captures the fun of the stock portion of an 18xx game within a very tense 30-45 minute time frame.  Unlike what Scott said in his video, this is NOT like poker, which would imply bluff, there is none, it is pure market manipulation, with the barest hint of luck in the buyer cards.  The tension is high as you try and move bulbs you know you don't have a majority in to pop early so the payoff is low,while moving your own interests ever higher.  Timing is everything.  Underated and under appreciated!

RATING: 5.5
A really interesting game right up until the end game part, where I had only 2 cards of each colour because that was all that was available when drafting cards. This meant that I couldn't Speculate by Proxy and so couldn't inflate the prices of the tulips I wanted without using all of my cards of that colour - which would enable my opponents to benefit but not me, so I was essentially left waiting for others to cause the bubbles to crash. This broke the game for me.

Before the end game mechanic, this game was easily a 7+. Now, it is a 5.5.

Very clever design yet VERY dry.  I can imagine that there are some who would really like this, but it really didn't do it for me.  There isn't alot happening and even the mechanic that I usually like (simultaneous action selection) just wasn't really that interesting.  

As a means to simulatling a bubble economy I think it does really well, it just didn't do it in a fun way.

Fantastic, minimalist economic simulation. Plays like a noose slowly tightening around your neck until the trapdoor opens.

After only one play a member of my group basically vetoed it from future game nights.  It's a shame, as I think there could be quite a good game here if we took the time to understand it.

Having played it again with a different group (one with a background in Trading and another in Finance) I'm convinced that the problem doesn't lie with this game.

This is very odd game. Very simple, but game dynamic is clever. Not really my cup of tea.

After 1 play. Good economic game with a quick play time and decent depth.  Will need future plays to determine the balance between strategy and luck, but I enjoyed it and it will definately hit the table again.

Impressions from playing the online version: fun game, but nothing special.  Feels a bit overly chaotic and too much at the mercy of the whim of coplayers.

I got it brand new from El Viejo Tercio in Spain. English/Spanish rules. I got less paper money in f 20. But its playable. My game group doesnt understand the logic in reality behind the proxy mechanic.We add a house rule of 10% comission for proxy purchase/speculation starting at f 500. It makes more sense to charge a recommended buyer for the info..its not free lol.

This is a really odd game.  For one, it has an economic system that I've never seen in a game before, so it took me a while (a LONG while) to figure out how to manipulate that system.  In addition, there seem to be a lot of fiddly rules that players have to remember, and it makes the game feel a little inorganic, if that makes any sense.  See, I think that if you're not supposed to buy a tulip of the same color that you sell on that turn, then there should be some way to track that on the board, instead of having to remember it.  Maybe I've been spoiled by games that track all of the game management on the boards, but I feel like it's better to have a visual reminder for rules like that, instead of just having to remember them all.  I'm not sure what I think of the game at the moment, but I would certainly play it again, now that I have an idea of how to play it.

According to [geekurl=/video/16551/tulipmania-1637/hello-a-review-of-tulipmania-1637]Hello Gregor's review[/geekurl], you really have to pay attention to what other people are doing. Wondering if it's sufficiently different to Ys. Seems it will be sufficiently different. Might have to get replacement Dutch money. Might wait for a reprint, and hope the new company pays royalties to Scott Nicholson.

This is a unique game not just for its theme, but also for its mechanical focus, an economic bubble market simulation. It's also quite fast, playing in under an hour, which is another rare quality, as investment games tend to be long drawn out affairs.

For the most part, I find playing chicken with the bubble fairly interesting, as is figuring out how to nudge your opponent's investments to make them less profitable. It's tough to do though and usually it is a game of margins and relative gains more than anything. Specifically targeting a leading player is all but impossible, so tactical plays usually dominate the outcome. Also, the insider trading and proxy actions are completely card dependent, which makes me wonder how much freedom of choice there really is. At times it felt like the cards were playing me, instead of the other way around.

All that being said, for the time being I think this one is worth keeping on the shelf. Stock market games that play in 45 minutes are not something to be taken for granted and even with my concerns, I still think it's fun filler or nightcap.

Gioco economico freddo e spietato tutto basato sulle bolle speculative. Bisogna investire in tulipani e cercare di farli fruttare nel miglio modo possibile fino a quando non esplode la bolla speculativa.

Interesting bubble market implementation. Very abstract feel, even though the game was designed around the theme. I've played it about 8-12 times, and the first play made no sense to me. With subsequent plays, where everyone knows how to play, the game began to shine. A fast game, but a bit more intense than normal filler.


Most of the time, if you use your efforts screw someone else instead of just advancing your own agenda, you really hurt yourself. Sometimes it's worth it.

First game is very strange, but in the second one you are really gone.
Very short (30-60 minutes), a bit Acquire like, bluf and luck

Not alot of eye cany but it is a good buy cheap, push up price and sell high. Difficult to do exactly as you chose because you only get a small number of cards but a decent game.

Another game where a poor explanation probably led me to not completely understand the game. 
Rules should be simple but their effect seems rather obscure.
Interesting and original theme. 
Even mechanics seem good till you try it but then some fog covers the table.
I'd like to play it again. I add half a vote for this indecision

Poco conocido juego económico de 3 a 5 jugadores que se basa en un suceso real: la primera burbuja económica de la historia: la crisis de los tulipanes. Tenemos que vender nuestros tulipanes al mejor precio antes de que el mercado estalle. Muy didáctico.

Very interesting, pretty fast game of speculation and crash!  I like the elegance of its mechanisms.  It's difficult to read the implications of the simple rules until you have played most of a game, but that's a good thing!

Very good economic cardgame.
But, the play is very tense and once the crisis starts, the rich players control the flow.  In other words, if you fail to ride the first wave of the crisis, this game is very hard for you.  There's no mercy in capitalism.  mmm.

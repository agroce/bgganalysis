I own and very much like Morisi, and haven't ever tried Netzwerk.  Netzwerk rules do not map 1:1 with Morisi rules, and Netzwerk tiles appear to be triples of hexagons rather than just single hexagons.  Morisi's art I also rather like more, though at some point I should try Netzwerk.

In Morisi, your score is based on the connectivity of your network(s)---e.g., how many warehouses your trade routes link together.  A particular network of five houses, for example, could have each warehouse connected to each other one (most efficient and thus highest-scoring), or could have them linked in a linear arc (not as efficient and lower-scoring).  Your little surveyors go out and gather knowledge about the land (in the form of cubes), which are what allow you to build trade routes from city to city in the first place.  Networking games are not common and are weirdly not intuitive on the first try (probably because they aren't common, so the mindset needed for them is not often used), and Morisi is no exception.

Where some people have got it wrong is in thinking that Morisi is another version of Settlers, which is entirely the wrong way to think about this game. Settlers was based on gathering resources to build cities to gather more resource to build etc., without thinking about how efficiently towns are connected to other towns.  Morisi is all about network efficiency, on the other hand, which is why the boards of the two games look so different during play.  If you think in networks, Morisi games have a certain beauty to them.... if you don't, the field looks like a mess.

In some ways, Morisi is like a very, very abstract railroad game... which are about building networks, but also about investments and shipping and so on.  Morisi doesn't show you the shipping, and the investment is relegated to the abstraction of scoring more points for efficient and large networks.  And you get to gather little cubes to build your networks, too.  The cubes and the uniqueness are what make a game of Morisi very tempting for me.

The two-player game is not too bad, and the game seems much better with three.  I haven't tried with four.

[I have since gotten to play a Real Train Game, Railroad Tycoon, and now I can draw several parallels from the railroad game genre to Morisi, particularly the importance of forming large networks.  There is no explicit delivery, but merely forming a well-connected networks of immense size is enough to win many train games, although there are more complications in getting there in train games.  I would say that Morisi is an abstract "train game" that I would gladly play more often, because it doesn't take as long, yet is satisfying.]

Quite nice, easy to teach and fast route building abstract. Lots of blocking and spacial optimization, this is an efficiency puzzle. One might as well play with open information. A game can be lost in the placement round, and this makes me a bit cautious with my rating. Bad packaging. Keeper.

RATING: 6.5
Played this with 2 and 3 players its better with 3 and would be even better with 4. As it is I'm not terribly impressed. The game does look very good. I really wanted to like it more than I did. The concept sounded very interesting when I read about it. However when we played it it went very fast and the strategy didn't seem all that difficult or that there was much opportunity to do anything creative or clever in regards to strategy. Traded for Tichu and Atta Ants.

Strategic and very abstract. Difficult to convince others to play.

RATING: 5
Clever game that comes packaged in a stubby tube. A Settlers like tile map is built featuring five colours of terrain, as well as around nine city tiles. Players earn points by building trade routes that connect cities together. To do this, they must move their "explorer" pawn around the map collecting cubes from the coloured tiles, then spending these cubes to build the routes. Players score points for their presence in the three largest cities (in terms of connections) plus any other city they linked up. Clever, and quite tactical.

RATING: 6
(Netzwerk edition)  Every game I've played always ends with an instant win by someone expending all of their houses, which is rather anti-climactic.  It's pointless to try connecting high-value cities because they don't ever get counted.  Feels broken.

This is one of the rare abstracts with bad paste-on theme that I actually like. It is explained rather quickly, plays very fast and has a certain level of depth. I do however believe that this needs to be played with players of roughly same strengh to get interesting, since otherwise the stronger players will often win through exhausting their houses.

Decent little connection game, but it seems a little weak and there is no way to stop someone that has strong lead.

Plays a little bit faster than I would have expected, though, and that's a plus.

Collect colored cubes from different terrain. Build roads to cities using those colored cubes to earn points, more points earned if your hub touches more cities. Very neat and simple game, with tactics in blocking off your opponents. However, in the games I played, the first player has an advantage, usually locking up the important route to enable them to score more points, then end the game on their turn, so there is no equal number of turns. I'll still play, but something needs to be done to offset the first player advantage.

RATING: 4
Played few times with 2. It feels like unfinished design of abstract game. I am pretty disappointed because there is really no connections between your piece and trading roads. It is like playing 2 games using one board - that sounds cool but not in this case.

Rating after two plays.  Excellent abstract that will take several more games before the deeper strategic subtleties start to become clear.  I own the original Cwali tube version.

I have never played Isi, the 2-player version of this game, but this one is fun to play. A little confusing on the scoring of houses, connections et al (we may be playing this one wrong), or I would have given this one a 9.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A neat little near-abstract game of movement, collection and connection. You get a variable Settlers type board, with 9 or so city hexes interspersed between 5 different terrain types. You move your pawn from hex to hex to collect the cubes off the terrain. Then you use the cubes to allow you to build trade routes (between cities) on the terrain types that you picked up the cubes for. Scoring is essentially most trade connections to the biggest cities.

It boils down to lookahead and a race to get the key connections made first, so there’s an advantage to going first between experienced players. It’s likeable. A bit fiddly to set up. The end-game becomes obvious as you can see the moves it will take to close it down. While you can’t quite determine the end-game from the starting positions (player interaction helps dictate the cube take-down), you pretty much choose your area from the start and it’s hard to change plans mid-stream - any lost turns getting to the other side of the board will cost the game. Unforgiving is the word, but the game is quick, so acceptable.

Interesting mechanic, but just doesn't hit the table enough as it's too abstract and the scoring lock-outs can be harsh. Traded away.

Another abstract signed Corné van Moosel. I really like his designs. Even though this might not be one of his best I always end up enjoying the experience. The initial positioning is extremely important. This leads to an awful lot of boardgazing during the first move.

Hmmm.  First, I must say that when the game is completed it is truly ugly.  The colors and the mismatched lines make you want to look everywhere but the board.  Blech.  The game, well, not too exciting, all the moves seemed obvious to me.  It worked just fine, and perhaps with more players it would increase in complexity, but even though I decimated people on my first go, I don&#039;t know how much fun I&#039;d ever have playing it again.  Fun is the key for me in games.

RATING: 5
It feels like there's a really good game struggling but ultimately failing to manifest itself here. The cube collecting aspect is interesting and has a nice mix of strategy (positioning yourself for late game) and tactics (getting what you need now, reacting to other players), but the scoring system left me scratching my head... it basically makes it so that you want to connect as many cities into one network, and in our game two players tied for the win as they both managed to connect 6 cities all to each other. Perhaps with more experience there would be more screwage but I imagine this would require an ungodly amount of analysis and ultimately not be worth the effort. I'd like to try again with 4 players instead of 3, but I'm highly doubtful that this has any legs..

Ok game, just slighlty concerned that it can drag a bit at the end with a few round where not a lot happens except you are just moving around the board collecting the last few cubes with little chance to build.

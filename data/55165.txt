Wow there is a lot of game in this box.  The track goes together very well and after printing out tracks from the website there are many choices.  The game needed more than one zball and different colors would be sweet.  Think these changes are coming.  I glad I purchased it and look forward to maybe buying a second game to make a really big track.

From the Review: This game has a great theme, good price and exceptional components. The z-ball also looks really cool. This would be a great game to get

RATING: 7
+ The control you can have over the z-balls is really quite amazing; Lots of configurations to try out!
- With the space required and the amount of time for set up, I just don't ever feel like pulling this game out.


Why it's previously-owned:
It's hard to exactly describe it.  Everyone had a good time when they were playing, but no one would ever pick this game over a deeper gaming experience.  Perhaps if I had kids of the right age the story would be different.
I traded this one away for Arkham Horror.  We now have Tumblin' Dice for when we have the dexterity itch.

A Much improved version of pitchcar.
+ The track is plastic and snaps together evenly, so as to not create uneven points to fly off on.
+ The Z-Ball allows more control and requires practice to master, unlike the pitchcar disks
+ A lot cheaper! and the individual components for sale as well as buying a big box of everything.
+ If you want a bigger track, buy Roadzters and get the variety of player markers.

RATING: 6.5
This is a dexterity game themed around bicycle racing.  It's obvious closest cousin is Carabande / Pitch Car.  However, this game uses a ball with beads inside it that cause it to spin in unique ways or to stop outright, even on an incline.  The components and the price point are spot on for what is delivered and the expansions are set as small packages so you can build up the parts that you might want/need.  Game play WILL take some getting used to as the trick of flicking a ball vs. flicking a Carabande disk are markedly different.  Once practiced though, the game starts to favor the better more experienced player - which is something that Carabande doesn't always deliver.

RATING: 7
Pros:  The z-ball makes for some really physics-defying trick shots.  I mean, you can make that sucker curve without ever hitting a guardrail.  This is really good because I think it really evens the playing-field with the kids trying to do what they know and occasionally getting lucky while the adults try something tricky because they can, and failing miserably for the most part.

Cons:  There were some track configurations that ended with, "oh hell, we'll put a jump there".   It's just me being perfectionist in my track layouts.

I don't like the bicycles.  There are some situations where you end up bottle-necking on the tunnel, and you basically have to let the guy ahead go first.  I really plan on swapping this out for roadsters as soon as they are available externally.

This comes with just one ball.  I think it really aught to have a second ball.  I ordered the three extra balls.  You only NEED one, but if that sucker gets lost, your game is done.  Given what you're doing with it, the likelihood of losing a ball, is high.

SOLD:  Got sick of picking the ball up off the floor or making the track too easy.

(KIDS) This is a PitchCar-like game with more finesse.  Players flick "Bisikle balls" instead of "wooden cars".  You can do so with English that causes quite a bit of swerving and such.  It's fun, but probably won't replace PitchCar for me.

Finger-flicking bicycle racing which uses a ball filled with bearings that is flicked along the track to indicate how your bikes move. You are supposed to be able to make the ball curl with practice. Yeah, like I could ever do that!

It is quite portable and the tracks are easy to set up and take down.

RATING: 7.5
If you like dexterity and racing, maybe cycling, this game is for you. This game is much like the classic Pitch Car, bu instead of flicking discs, you flick a z-ball, which is essentially just a ball partially filled with some type of beads. This allows for trick shots here you can purposely spin the ball and get some interesting shots. The z-ball is fun, but realistically the discs of pitch-car are better suited for skilled play. It's not uncommon to make a nice shot with the z-ball and have it go a great distance but then spin itself off the edge. Still an excellent dexterity game and so fun to make courses for. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Bisikle is a more economical version of Carabande (or Pitch Car). It's made of plastic, but it's sturdy and easy to assemble/disassemble. One cool thing about this version of the game is that you can raise and lower the tracks, which makes the courses a lot more challenging.
The game is also played with a small weighted ball, instead of with wooden discs.
If price were no object, I'd recommend Pitch Car. But it's hard to imagine anyone being disappointed with this.

I like it.  Flexible track that seems to fit together better than Pitchcar does.  But, it doesn't seem to have the same flow as Pitchcar.  I suspect it's because I dont have the skills yet for the Z-ball, but I'm looking forward to getting better.

RATING: 8
Played once, found it a clever Carabande-like game. The interaction of gradients with the ball-bearing-weighted balls is especially interesting. I also like that it's got some inertia, so moves tend to be shorter and a little more tactical, and less likely to be blown out by a lucky shot, as can happen in Carabande. Also, the plastic playing surface and round ball are less likely to be impacted by seams and other track imperfections, which could be a hassle in Carabande. While the ZBall does have some interesting potential for spins and such, it's also still light and seems like it can be a little finicky, so we'll see if the game has staying power. But initial impressions were favorable, and it's very nice that that they give you get a little bit of everything (tunnel, jump, risers) in the base set.

Track Hints: put the rails a little late on the curves to make them a little easier. Putting some gradients on the tracks make them much more interesting, but you might want to stick to a straight hill the first time out, curves on hills can be rather tricky.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Very much akin to a cheap PitchCar with plastic instead of wood and instead of discs using a ball. The gimmick is the ball is not weighted evenly so it has some weird rolls to it and makes for some funny moments when some easy shots become much harder because of the ball. It was enjoyable, but PitchCar easily is my preferred choice for dexterity race game.

Very much like Pitchcar, except for two significant differences:

1) the base set includes a LOT of material (jump, tunnel, etc) to provide more interesting track options than vanilla Pitchcar can provide.

2) The nature of the Z-ball allows for some real skill and manipulation to the roll of the ball. You can turn corners. You can navigate up a hill. But its not easy and some experience will pay off. Despite that, you can open the box and everyone can be playing in moments....with no real learning curve to actually playing/enjoying the game.

I'm happy to own both games. I'm impressed with the production quality and support Bisikle is receiving. I foresee pulling this one out from time to time for quite a while.  Set-up and take-down are MUCH easier than Pitchcar, which I can't ignore.

First impression: the ball move is a bit too wobbly. Quality of pieces is a bit low. I'm pretty sure you can't make any tracks with any straight pieces at 45 degree angles, but the instructions don't say that, so it's a bit frustrating until you figure that out.

Players race bicycles around a pre-constructed modular track.  Ingenious flicking game, very similar in concept to Carabande/Pitchcar, where players take turns to flick their piece around the track.  The difference here is the piece is a "Z-Ball" - a small plastic ball filled with metal ball-bearings to give it some heft and control.  After a frustrating first hour, you can suddenly spin the ball around corners, make it stop on slopes, provide backspin for more control.  Amazingly clever game, with fantastic components.  Downside?  Veterans will absolutely smash beginners which can kill the fun.  Other than that, superb.

First impressions after a solo race:

Seems to improve on Pitchcar in nearly all ways:

- Half the price
- Contains several obstacles in the base set that Pitchcar only has in expansions (tunnels, jumps, elevated track, 45-degree curve track pieces)
- Expansion packs are about $5 a piece
- The Z-ball is far more forgiving on cracks in the track than discs. (No need for business cards to even out the track for a perfect fit.)
- Assembly time is slightly faster. (While it takes longer to connect the tracks, it's much faster installing the rails.

So far, the only thing Pitchcar seems to have over Bisikle is the turn process (Pitchcar = flick your disk, Bisikle equals replace your bike with the Zball, mark your spot with the flag, flick the ball, replace ball with bike and flag) and number of players (8 vs 4).

Maybe later a second copy..., first I will try which one will fit more to my game group. Bisikle or RoadZters. 

We started with Bisikle, an absolute fun game. Nice with more than four players, you have to consider an extra pack of four more bikes. We play it with six. 

...done now, having 8 bikes, and 3 more copies of Roadsters, using the same track tiles, same content in the box only the bikes are replaced by cars.

After playing this, not sure I will keep Pitch Car.  This is so much lighter, takes up less space, easier to assemble, and is cheaper!  Not only that, you can use English to control the ball. The use of the flexible rails to also become obstacles is very unique & certainly ads interesting creativity to the game.  I am pleased the way the rails, obstacles, & flag markers fit quickly & easily into the track.

Unfortunately it falls apart pretty easily, and still takes some set up time, especially if you don't follow a layout. On creating original layouts I spend FOREVER trying to get the pieces to come together to complete a circuit--the last connection is ALWAYS an inch off, then the track starts falling apart as I try to fix it.

I am really pleased with the company that RoadZters is completely compatible.

Fun dexterity game; the Z-balls are awesome.  I wish there were a bit more flexibility in the base game for setting up tracks; if you really want to get creative, you have to order more track parts, which kind of sucks.  Also, I don't like how it's only for four players, and the "extra bikers" you can buy are inexplicably in the EXACT SAME COLORS as the base game.

Still, I enjoy it, and it has a "wow" factor set up on the table.

After a multiple hour session with the guys, this game has rocketed up to the very top of my favorite dexterity games. I just love flicking games to begin with, and purely from a laughs and smiles (and rages) per hour rating, this is right there at the top. I don't know that it's a better game than picth car, but for the time being I think I enjoy it even more. Never thought I would say that. Still happy to own both and feel it's worth owning both. Pitch car is more "pure" and Bisikle is just outrageous fun. 

Now have two whole sets (plus extra jumps and zballs and things).

If you just want a casual flick racing game with a reasonable price tag then Bisikle is a great choice. The Z-ball is a fun innovation, but it is not for everyone, perfectly executed trick shots are great when they come off - but things can get a bit frustrating with the ball spinning off the track in all directions. Pitchcar has a long pedigree and in my opinion offers a more fluid and satisfying gaming experience but this comes at an increased price.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game is very similar to Pitchcar, but the differences in feel make it worth owning both games. They did a lot of things right with this game and improved on the faults that Pitchcar has. For example: The rails snap in place on the sides of the tracks, so they don't constantly pop out. The plastic road pieces fit together easily and provide a snug and smooth fit. Surprisingly, the track pieces stay flat and smooth, even when adding the pillars underneath for height changes.

You get quite a lot of pieces all in the base set. Including a ramp and tunnel, which is a huge plus. The expansions are cheap and allow you to add to the game. Allowing for bigger track configurations.

As you probably already know. Instead of flicking pucks. You flick a little weighted ball, which can be very tricky and unpredictable. I think this will take a little getting used to. Especially, when used to flicking the pucks in Pitchcar, which give you a little more control of your shots.

All in all. I had a lot of fun and laughs with this game. The improvements over Pitchcar, were a very warm welcome. If you like Pitchcar. I highly recommoend this game also, as they both have enough of a different feel, to justify owning both and you can't beat all you get for the price.

A fun flicker of a game.  That is, one flicks the ball along the road track to advance one's pawn in this Racing Themed Game.  The ball is hollow with loose weights inside. With practice it is possible to get the ball to follow the track as it makes a 180 degree curve. I have seen a billiard ball make an S shaped curve but have yet to figure out how it was done or how to get the Z-Ball to make such a maneuver. If anyone knows how to do either I'd like to learn how.

Better than Pitchcar IMO.  The track pieces are very nice and textured.  The set is a great value for everything you get.  The kids love it.

I want to get 3 more Z-balls.  Other than that, just more of everything for longer tracks.  It comes with plenty to keep you satisfied though.

You can spin the balls and do some cool things, but the ball can be unpredictable as well, so you have more and less control if you know what I mean.

Sometimes the ball just keeps spinning after it stops moving forward and spins off the track.  Might need a house rule for that.

You can make it as hard as you want.  Set up a course with lots of turns and no rails for a challenge.  Personally I like the rails, as it enables you to make some cool shots. 

I just realized, it kind of feels like putt-putt.  That would be a great next game in the series :)

I'm not a hardcore Pitchcar player - I play mainly with my kids.  So from that perspective, I would still probably choose Pitchcar over Bisikle for a couple reasons.

1. Fewer rails.  This basically means that my kids are hitting it off the track quite a bit.  For more skilled players, this isn't that big of a deal.  But the rails are only enough to handle most of the curves, so you have to be a lot more exact.

2. Longer setup time.  This is a marginal issue, but still important to me.  This could be because I'm more used to Pitchcar, but it's a lot easier to setup Pitchcar.

3. Greater level of skill required.  Flicking the ZBall is harder than the little Pitchcar discs.  This should be a selling point for many people, since they would probably prefer a little added amount of skill in their games.  But for me, playing with my kids, the greater level of control required is a drawback.

I completely agree with other posters.  Although I love PitchCar, and I always will, this game completely fires it.  I find myself thinking about it all the time (reliving spectacular break aways, turns, mistakes, victories, etc.), and my family loves it, too.

I was excited to play this game but it ended up being a lot of frustration and not much fun. I think the game could be good if one put in time to practice and become comfortable with the flicking, but then you have the problem of differing skill levels. It's hard for a person to stay close if they have played less.

Well-produced, nicely priced, but a little disappointing so far. Not sure it has anything to offer beyond [i]Carabande/Pitchcar,[/i] except for the Z-ball, which is pretty neat though hard to control. Wlll definitely give it more tries. [3 plays]

It's much harder to control the ball than I anticipated. Good fun though; my downfall is definitely that I want to have the "most awesome insanely long shot ever" and thus get stuck from going off the course often.

It's a nice flicking game, nothing wrong with it, it's just either your cuppa or not. I guess it can be fun with the right crowd at the right time but the need of setting it all up and then taking it down after is a bit too much hassle for this to hit the (very large!) table regularly.

While I enjoy the game, I thought I would like it more. That z-ball is very difficult to use. I thought I would get the hang of it easy enough, but after a few hours of play, still don't have a grasp on it. I would still like to play this over Pitchcar which has its track issues that prevent me from enjoying it.

Don't know which is better, Carabande or Bisike. Carabande is elegant and spartan with its components, but Bisike features the Z-Ball. It's a plastic ball filled with ball bearings; the interior of the plastic ball has indentations in which the ball bearings can get trapped. This enables you to flick and control the Z-Ball in far more interesting ways.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
On yer bike! Good alternative to Pitch Car. You need a bit more finesse as it takes some skill to get the Z Ball going. Also easier to set up and take down. I've played 2 players - 5 players, and it's always a laugh. Two sets may give you some more interesting tracks - but I love the ramp and the raised tracks at the moment anyway.

--Dec2010-- I'm roughly as enthusiastic about this as I am about PitchCar/Carabande.  Here, the track interlocks a bit better - with a bit better control over the relative levels of the two sides of a joint.  I'm not convinced the Z-Ball is a huge improvement over flicking a disk - but it's definitely interesting.

I don't think you need this one if you already have Pitchcar unless the idea of the Z-ball really impresses you.  The Z-ball does lend some additional control over the flicking and it is distinctly different than the wooden disks, but the overall play is essentially the same.  The flags and bicycles are a nice addition for keeping track of where you are.  The track is nice and the rails are better than those in pitchcar.  I would say everyone ought to own one of these two games and if you don't mind plastic, Bisikle is cheaper and just as fun.

I love racing games and dexterity games.  PitchCar is a favorite of mine.  I really was looking forward to this game.  I like being able to construct track.  Unfortunately, building with this is much more difficult than with PitchCar.  It is much more of a challenge to make a track that actually works with the included pieces.  I thought that the Z-ball would be interesting as well.  Unfortunately, it was not what I hoped.  Our experience is that we had little control beyond short distances, which made the game really chaotic.  Granted, we had a lot of fun playing the game and I like the game well enough.  But I already have and love PitchCar.  As much as I want to like this as much, I can't.  [01/08/2011]

A few plays in. It has an interesting mechanic similar to PitchCar but with a weighted ball instead of a wooden disc. I think the ball allows more opportunity for trick shots or "English", whereas the disc is more point and shoot. A lot more track options with the latter and probably better for more players. I think in the end it comes down to theme, track size and which flicking mechanic you would enjoy more?

This was a cool little dexterity racing game. I liked the neat spheres that you flick around the track, as you can add spin to them to get them around curves and such. Quite a neat little game.

You get those huge come from behind flicks. The ones you want to get when you play a racing game. The ones where it is all or nothing, you go for it, and sometimes you get it. I am not even close to pulling off a tricky shot, but rate this game highly nonetheless.

I've just started playing this with my daughter and have found that I have a much harder time controlling the z-ball than the disk. And jumping??? I can't even get close to landing on the track and staying. However, I like dexterity game and I've shown a tiny bit of improvement so this could be a keeper.

As far as flicking goes, this one runs kind of stale.  I mean, I love crokinole, I like catacombs, but the bike racing theme just didn't help any, and the concept itself is a little repetitive for some reason.

Already owning Pitchcar, I'm not sure I see a need for this. Its definitely fun, and I think with practice their might be a little more skill than with Pitchcar due to being able to spin the z-ball, but it doesn't seem to have quite the same action and fun level, as having to place the bikes and flags slows the game down. The track is very nicely designed though, and fits together really well.

Finally played a couple of games. I'm going to say...trying to jump a length of two straight track pieces is a pain in the butt.

I liked it, though.  In some ways, it's less accessible than PitchCar, which is interesting. You just get some strange responses from the Z-ball.  I'm curious if my opinion will change as I get more familiar with how it responds.  The only trick I've learned is how to get it to 'knuckleball', and just slide.

After learning a couple more tricks, I like the game even more.

Bisikle inevitably is going to invite comparisons with Pitchcar, given how similar the games are. Comparing the two, I can see some of the upside for Bisikle. The weighted Z-Ball is going to appeal to some folks, and does allow for some trick shots that can't be made with the wooden disks in Pitchcar. Bisikle also has a better price point - about $30 compared with $50-plus for Pitchcar. But to my mind, if price is not a concern, Pitchar is the better game. The rules are better in Pitchcar, and sample track designs are completely missing in Bisikle while not only provided but also carefully thought out in Pitchar. One of the main reasons I'd favor Pitchcar is the wooden track pieces ... the plastic track in Bisikle tends to slide around on a wooden table. Bisikle isn't bad at all, especially given the lower cost, but I'll stick with the solid wooed feel of Pitchar.

Great gift from my Dice Tower 2010 Secret Santa! This is very similar to Pitch Car, but the track is plastic, the rails snap in, there are different types of obstacles and instead of a disc, players flick a plastic ball that is filled with several smaller balls. Depending on how the ball is flicked, it can have top spin, back spin and side spin and can be manipulated to go around a curve without even touching the outer rail. For the first few laps, it can be very difficult to control. This race game definitely takes a bunch more skill than Pitch Car and it has a steep learning curve. Once mastered though, the races can be a lot more interesting with the possibilities of spinning ball manipulation. I think the tracks can be used for Pitch Car as well and don't have the seams that haunt the Pitch Car tracks.

This game feels like it plays itself. You flick the ball, but you usually have to hit the guard rails in order for it to stay on course properly. So each player usually follows the same pattern. Also, the rules are very poorly done and you have to go online to find out how to set up different tracks. The components are good quality, however. Crokinole has replaced every other dexterity game for me.

Sold.

3 reasons Bisikle is better than Pitchcar:

1) flicking a ball rather than a disc means the track does not have to be perfectly smooth.  In Pitchcar slightly warped pieces created seams.  Also the Bisikle track pieces fit perfectly.

2) The Z-ball allows for more control than a wooden disc.  There is definitely more skill involved in Bisikle.

3) Bisikle is MUCH cheaper than Pitchcar.  You can buy two copies of Bisikle with a huge amount of track and stunt pieces and 8 bicycles for significantly less than Pitchcar.

The only advantage Pitchcar has over Bisikle is that it is easier for kids to play, which does matter to me, but does not outweigh all of the disadvantages.

Update: I wish I could control the ball better. I am sure it would get more play if it were easier to control.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 5
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 5


Overall - 1

I actually did not find this game bad. It was not as difficult as other flicking games, reminded me of fun games I played as a child, and was very quick. It is easy to learn. My only problem is that, in fact, it is too easy. There is not anything to it at all- I would hardly call it a game so much as a distraction. There is no way to interact with other plays, affect the game, or anything- all you do is move forward and hope to get there first. Meh.

RATING: 6.5
*Rating based on one play.

Pretty fun game of space conquest.  The theme is cool and well done and the gameplay is solid and seems pretty well balanced.  Perhaps outstays its welcome with 4 players (playing to 8 VPs).  It also creates situations where a player is put into a king-maker scenario, which is a negative to me.

I might have rated it higher except that I don't tend to like games with direct attacking, which this one has in spades.  Usually there is a strategic reason to pick one opponent over another, but there are times when the decision is a coin flip, and those are the times when I don't like playing games with direct attacking.  I don't like having to choose an opponent to attack when I have no in-game reason to choose one over another.

Very much not the game for me.  This is a war game dressed up in euro-style clothes.  Rock-paper-scissors as meted out by the tactics cards.  I like how the backs of the planet cards make each round different.  I dislike how the rich can get richer, though that actually can even out over time if the poor save up their resources for a later turn.  The tech tree feels.. wrong.  I won without ever going beyond tech level 1.  Which feels wrong.  *shrug*  Maybe that's just luck from opponents' choices/actions.  Or the tactics cards, I dunno.

In any case, not my game.  But a good game for what it is and what it does, so there is that.  If you like war game styled things, maybe you'll like this.  I don't so I don't.  YMMV.

N.B.  I rated this a 6 because it's a good game.  I really wanted to rate it a 4 or 5 because I don't like it, but the game is good enough for a 6.  Give it a shot.  Undoubtedly there are others who will like this game a heck of a lot more than I do.

Simply one of the worst card games ive had the displeasure of playing. Was attracted by the really nice art and the fleet battles idea.

1. 18 Cards to choose from (Information Overload).
2. Extremely boring and cumbersome Combat system (add up total of ships place counters on your enemies) whoever still standing at the end wins the planet.
Rinse, Repeat.

We didnt even want to finish the first game it was so dry, unthematic, simplistic and gamey.

Comparisons to Taj Majal are apt, but also reveal a significant weakness in the game.  Unlike Taj, you do not get rewarded here for quitting early, and the game is sufficiently short (and things are sufficiently cheap) that there is not much reward for conserving resources.  Multiplayer diplomacy dominates.

Very smooth, intuitive space opera warfare card game where you construct buildings and units, and then upgrade them to participate in planetary conquests which earn you Titanium and thus victory. Fantastic artwork, simple but effective story, and mechanics that are a breeze to pick up. Better than its response would dictate.

One of the worst games i've every played. The game suggests a (complex) strategy game but comes along with so much randomness and frustrating game-play, that i won't play it again. This game becomes a 2-Star rating for the nice artwork and the good planet/event mechanic, the rest of the game is worse. 

The problem of the game is the strong competitive game-play, were every player has to fight for a planet each round to get bonuses and to expend your territory. If you don't get a planet, you will stay at the same level like at the beginning of the game, because you cannot build up your empire or build more ships. The fighting component is the main mechanic of the game and takes the most play-time. This wouldn't be bad, if the fights have a strategic depth or were fun to play, but in fact, you draw tactic cards, hope that they match a ship type you can activate, hope that they match a ship type they can attack, and hope that you could attack before a player takes you out of combat. This complete randomness is frustrating especially when a player becomes a runaway leader and not every player acts against him.

Additionally in most time, the battles leads to a destruction of your fleet (also triggered by the events) and you have to rebuild them, so the game feels like:
Build nice ships, ships destroyed, rebuild ships, ships destroyed, rebuild ships, ....

not my type of game...

RATING: 5
I enjoyed this, but feel like the static board (of "what can you buy?" each game) would make for same-y feeling games after not too many plays.

It also looks like you can get pasted badly enough that you've just got to rebuild for a couple turns, lest your ships be ground into hamburger by a superior fleet, and I'd imagine that wouldn't be as much fun.

I do like some aspects of the battle resolution system, though.

Titanium Wars is a great little game. Just ignore that you're fighting over an ultrarare energy source that someone named after a known element on the periodic table. It's a great fleet builder with refreshingly little arc- You'll have brilliant victories and crushing defeats, but there's a  sort of reset before each battle which makes each confrontation fresh.

RATING: 10
Best with 4 Players

One of my favorite game. Ok it may seems be chaotic for some players  but the fun is 100% present and the game is very thematic. And dont misinterpretate i am a worker placement lover but sometimes my brain need to cool down a little drinking just plain fun games like this one. The game is harsh (all your fleet may end up destroyed) so be wise before entering in an offensive and leave when necessary. 

it feels like a  4X space game ( more like a 2X ) which not last 6 hours. 

- Beautiful
- Rely strongly on bluffing and diplomacy
- Very thematic
- BUY AND FIGHT GAME
- Very tense ( should i enter the battle or not !!!!!)
- Extension is wonderfull and correct some flaws ( in the vanilla game the loser may feel it a bit difficult to catch up)

NB: 
Dont use paper money !!! , use a piece of paper to keep track of your balance account and to write the goods you intend to buy during  the market phase. Decrease the fiddlyness drastically so you can concentrate on FIGHTS !!!

Think about Starcraft the computer game where Humans, Protos and Zerg fight against each other, but in this game, there are only humans. 

You start with the same amount of money. Use money to buy ships/units, buildings and weapon/shield/tech upgrades. 

Some ships allow you to have more slots to equip more weapons, and each plays starts being able to pilot 4 ships. There is even a so called "Battle cuiser" like what you have in Starcraft because its the mega sized ship with the biggest health and you can have more weapon and shield upgrades.

After all players have purchased all their ships, upgrades and buildings, players choose to participate in a battle or not. Whoever participates in a battle will display a tactic card. Tactic cards each have a number on them from 0-7. The smaller number starts the battle and becareful when using tactic cards as they may be of strategically played as some tactic cards only allow certain types of ship to attack or certain amount of damage (some tactic cards allow certain types of ship to deal double damage). Players battle until the last one standing and the winner will own a planet that they have been battling in. The winner's planet may allow the player to pilot more ships or control more buildings or play more tatic cards, etc. The most important thing about winning battles is that you will own titanium as a result of winning the war. The player with 7,8 or 9 titanium will win the game depending on number of players.

Not a keeper for me but as the tactical cards which comes out destroys the play value of the game

Titanium Wars is a Taj Mahal style round winning card game. For making more tactical choices and various strategies, the author had added many mechanics inside, for exemple, various character powers, tactical cards, simulataneous action selection, multifarious card functions, negotiation and war game system. Unfortunately, however, the author's daring attempt is turned out a mere mistake. All kinds of diverse mechanics in Titanium Wars made the game much more complicating. In this hybrid system, the game is more likely be sterile. While playing, Players sometimes feel that the game is just a total mess. It is quite certain that a game based on round winning system is working better with simple and clear mechanics.

Initial Rating: N/A (August 2013)

I read the rules last Friday, they are very easy to grasp, however I´m worried about the (seemingly) prevalence of the hated (by me) mechanic of “attack the leader”. It seems to be very easy to attack the leader so he won’t get the planet assuring a longer game and very similar scores at the end.  On the other hand, as you can choose your battles, perhaps that is enough to offset my previous impression. I will play soon to see what option does Titanium Wars swing. 

Also, I really dislike the game name, I thought Titanium  made reference to the metal, not to some new kind of energy.

At last I got to play this. I have to say the leader effect wasn´t as prevalent as I thought it would be (as players can refrain from fighting) but I think that is group dependent. The game felt too short even though I was able to get 9 points (long game). It is WAY too light for my taste, I will hang onto it for now, but more likely I will sell it. 

It has some interesting decisions, mostly in the outfitting phase and the art is great and I like the theme, however when you play, the play area is generally a mess with cards. Also it seems to have too few different cards.

The game components are very good except for the small and thin paper money :(

For now I’m willing to give it another try, this time with the advanced rules (each player reveals it tactic in order), but I don’t have high hopes for this one.

Random, and much more AEG random than I like. (Yes I know this is IELLO).  The whole combat system is very wonky and a little too free and easy and open to too much interpretation.  My demo from the IELLO booth was really awful and of the four people at the booth, none of them could collectively answer several questions we had.  

Several people in my group still bought the game and I got the privilege of playing this game five or six times.  Yuck if I never have to play this mess of a game again I will be happy.  There is a good game somewhere here (hence why I played it so many times) but I feel it is severely undercooked, under tested, and trys to slog too many ideas into a shell that doesn't work.  Some games literally were done in two turns.

Despite having a lot of different cards to buy, I felt like this game didn't offer me a ton of choices, as a lot of them felt like more of the same. This is definitely not my cup of tea, as I dislike games that promote wailing on the leader, or all-or-nothing games where the person who spent the second most resources get nothing in compensation compared to the person who quit immediately. The different priority attack cards I thought were cool, adding more tactics, though this game is still rather light. Money is much too small.

This game seems to be a cross between Nexus Ops and Core Worlds (as it is kind of like Nexus Ops with cards).  However, whereas Nexus Ops is a game where you want 2 or 4 and core worlds 4 or 5, this is a game where you want 3.  Watch Vasal's Dice Tower review before making a decision on this one ... it will hit the sweet spot for some game groups with low player counts, but did not hit mine ...

Started out promising, but ended so fast and with the winner totally decided by the other players.  Once we ganged up on the leader there was no chance for him, despite his good play.  And my attacking him made me way too weak to be able to beat the other major opponent, and so I lost.  Maybe not enough card options.  Cannot imagine playing the short game!

A 3-4 player game that rather defies traditional genre description, although does contain elements of deck-building, tableau-building, and simultaneous-action-selection.

Unfortunately, unusual mechanics aside, this game really doesn't live up to it's interesting sci-fi premise and honestly doesn't feel very thematic at all when you get down to playing it. 

By far the biggest strike against it is that it relies far too heavily on luck-of-the-draw to get the right tactics cards you need to activate your ships. Without the right cards you literally can't do anything, which often will result in your entire fleet being blown to smithereens before you even have a chance to respond. This is an incredibly frustrating and all-too-frequent occurrence in the game.

Game has been sold due to far better games being in my collection!

Got this in a local auction- turned out it had been opened but punch cards were intact.  I gave this to my 15 year old and he really likes it.  He plays with me and his brother.  He talked his mom and sister into playing it also.  We have started to tweak it to make the game play a little better- just starting with one level of tech more than we should.

Nice concept. Buy cards from center market pool which are ships and upgrades, etc. Then use them to fight over a new planet which comes up every round. Essentially, it's an auction game disguised by combat. Doesn't really work in practice as the combatants of a round are weakened for the next and there aren't enough variety of cards.

After one play I feel it is to much "talk the others into attacking the leader - the snipe the win" for my taste.
If you are really good all other players will team up on you and the 2nd or 3rd strongest player will take the win.

Might give it another chance though.

I normally don't go for pick-specific-neighbors-to-attack games, but this one is really interesting and works well.  There's so much unusual going on with this streamlined space combat game — not the least of which being the planets available as incentives, and the conditions that constrain the current conflict.  Very cool game!  Two of my first opponents promptly bought a copy when we were done.  Huge bonus:  The card art is lush and immersive.

Also, I really like the risk/reward give/take in this game.

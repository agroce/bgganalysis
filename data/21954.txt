Good buddy bought this and after one play I liked it enough to play it several more times.  It's a bit of a brain burner and a bit long for a game with just three turns with four players.  Thanks Joshua for adding to our rotation.

RATING: 5
Interesting, if slow. It feels like the three turns were necessary to give "texture" to the victory point spread, but I think the game would work better with only two. 

The two chunks of each turn - elections and battle - I thought were matched well and integrated nicely. Essentially, you're buying and investing in different armies through an area control game, then using those armies in battles of different significance. Each battle has an associated army designated as the defender. What makes it interesting is that if you are the designated defender, you can give away the right to defend in the battle, and there's some other wheeling and dealing going on through alliances.

I think if the battles actually appeared on the map it would really bring out the theme and make a stellar game. Perhaps that's a project worth pursuing.

Meh, this war-themed euro just reinforces my thoughts that I probably only enjoy Wallace's economic games. This game wasn't bad but it just didn't do anything for me. The rules seemed rather confusing as well, so I was surprised when the game itself was quite simple. Doubt I'll be playing this one again.

RATING: 9.5
In the long run, I'd say this is likely to prove to be as good a game as Struggle of Empires - though it's much quicker.  I love the balancing mechanisms the game has.  It's a lot of fun and deep without suffering too much AP - downtime is not an issue.  It's a  a stonking success, and I am very keen to play this as often as I can. 

The different cities can all have their attractions, I love the way the cubes placed as influence are often snatched away by the Machievelian tactics of others.  I love the addition of the Persians to the mix and I love the way the battles come out and are decided.  Really the game is a veritable cornucopia of wonderful ideas.  

You also get a nice product for your money.  The box, board, rules and chits are attractively and glossily done.  However, the rules are typically Wallacian.  They are a nightmare to read the first time.  An experienced player  could explain this one MUCH better than the rules do. You think "what is this all about?"  Luckily, it all falls into place beautifully!  Having played it about 5 or 6 times now, I'd have to raise this to the honourable heights of a 9.5.  A really good game with a lot of subtlety and edgy balancing mechanisms.

This one continues to surprise me. When you read the blurb, it sounds kind of dry. The board makes it look like Tower of Babel - which put me right off to start with.
The game is anything but dry.

Good points:
I can think of few combat games where you don't normally know who's won until you add up the points. This one's just like that. It's as tight as the proverbial duck's back-passage. In five player games at least three are usually neck and neck and often 4 or 5.
The Persians are a touch of genius.
The combat system is simple enough for a Euro without being boring - I find Antike, Imperial and Vinci deadly dull in that respect. Here, you don't know who's won until they do. A contested battle is never totally cut and dried.
Several ways of winning. You can balance them up or swing heavily towards one. All seem to be about as likely to get you a win. Now that's clever!
Very quick to play - 90 mins once you know it
Edgy in both parts of a turn - chit picking and battles
The special chits add just the right amount of uncertainty.

My only experience with this game is trying 5 sides solitaire.  There is something left out of that experience because this game has hidden information, so take this with the grain of salt.

Outside of [thing=39351][/thing], I have not been a big fan of the Martin Wallace Eurogames.  However, I have liked pretty much every war game he made and the reason why is that he has a cool Euro-like element in them.  If that sounds like cognitive dissonance, well, sorry.  That's how I roll.  I like innovative ideas while I crush my opponents!

That said, this one has the sides vying to become leaders of 6 city-states.  The more you control, the more VPs you'll probably get and it will aid you in combat (even more VPs) since you will control the military resources of that city-state.  In some ways, it reminds me of [thing=199904][/thing], which came 11 years later.  In both of them, you have a political segment and then a military segment.

The combat is dice-based, but requires multiple rolls to resolve, so it is not a case of getting diced on one roll.  Well, it could, but if it comes down to that one roll, that's what makes wargames so great!  The combat system is simple, yet fresh, which is exactly what I like about Wallace's wargames.

So how does it compare to Mark Herman's Pericles game?  Well, it's not a fair comparison.  This one is faster-playing and more tailored for the Euro crowd, whereas that one is rooted more in the history and targeted for grogs.  If you are wanting a tighter simulation, the other game is for you.  Wallace doesn't hide the fact that his games are about balance and game play more than history.  I like them both and have an audience for both, although I think this one is going to be more of a game I play at a convention, since it is hard to find the right number of players.

This is the first game that my gaming group abandoned based on how bad we thought the game was. In fact, we didn't even bother finishing the round or scoring the game! I thought the area control election part was very well done, refreshing in fact. However, where the game fell apart for us was the combat phase, which trivalized all the work that was done by reducing the combat battle to a series of dice rolls that seemed improperly weighted. In fact, over 50% of the battle winners were by city states with less military strength going into the dice roll.

Pushes all the right buttons with the area control and political influence. Plays best with 5 and takes 3+ hours, which means it doesn't hit the table often.

RATING: 6
An interesting twist on area control in that the player with the most cubes in each city state will not necessarily govern it; you need to be nominated and then have more cubes than the other guy.  Control of a city gives you its forces for the military half of the game.  The wargame element is very simply handled, but is nonetheless quite time consuming, with several rounds of hidden placements followed by lots of die rolling.  As with many Wallace designs, Perikles presents plenty of strategic and tactical choices.  The reason I don't rate it higher is that I feel that luck (in die rolls, in gambling on the placement of hoplites and galleys, in the turn of tiles) plays too great a part in deciding the outcome of a game of this length.

RATING: 8.5
Based on one play.  Ended up winning in a close game by having two statues in a big scoring city.  Others who scored a lot of VP tiles in the battles were hot on my heels which indicates to me this is a well balanced game.  Had more games now and my opinion hasn't changed.

RATING: 7
Nice mixture of wargame and politics set in Ancient Greece. The rules are simple enough and there is a lot of room for deal making and backstabbing. Players are trying to be elected kings in the various city-states. At the end of each round combat begins and each player controls the armies of the city states he controls. Its a fun and tense game.

Perhaps I was a little hard on this one after my first game. I had some bad dice rolls, but it did feel like there was lots of stuff to think about, then an uncomfortable gear change to a big dice-rolly bit. I'd certainly play again, and could imagine improving my rating once I got my head around minimising the luck.

as noted in other comments, i find a lot of wallace games underdeveloped and lacking in playtesting.  this is, in my opinion, a superior wallace title.  explainable rules, good mechanics, and you can jump right in and play.  it struck several of us in my four-player game that some compensation for turn order might be needed.  fan of the drafting system.  i've read a bit of back and forth about combat, and i found it to be fine.  pleasant, even, and i thought the chart lookups were simple by sweeping across and looking for a first match.  the game seemed to bog down quite a bit in the pre-combat placement, though, and i think it was probably for the best on the first game that an alternate ending was triggered.  i like the alternate ending system in this too, btw, not wonky like i found it in liberte.  overall looking forward to another play, although i think three players might be the sweet spot in terms of play time and closer turn order equity.

Wallace has a representation for being able to combine Euro and Wargames.  This is a good example of this blend.  The game consists of 2 main stages.  In the first, game play is area majority placement; in the second, simplified combat resolution.  These two elements are tied nicely together in a very smooth and intuitive way.  What is not intuitive is the rules governing combat.  They are an exercise in cognitive comprehension that will leave many scratching their head.  Fear not though, for once you have the rules down, it turns out to be a straight forward game to play and perhaps one of the easier Wallace titles out there.  If you like majorities games and don't object to a little confrontation, this is an excellent game.

A reasonably good political-warrish game with both of these aspects presented in a simplistic yet quite interesting mechanics. I especially like cleverness and tension of its dice-driven battles. The historical flavor is also quite noticeable despite aforementioned simplicity. On the other hand some space for kingmaking and negotiations here is something I'm not very fond of but I guess in this genre those things are inevitable.

RATING: 6.1
Game looks beautiful--large board, although lots to punch out and there is an error in the parts inventory. However seeking rules clarifications on BGG has led me to a colloquy of frustrated users, whose consensus is that there are amendments and errors-of omission in the rulebook.  I've lost all patience for that sort of problem (I've read way too many poorly-written rules, and there are way too many things I never get to play). 

Half of the game is area control, where having presence in any of six cities is a good thing, but doesn't guarantee you control of that city (you need to run for an election for that).  That part is actually OK.  Unfortunately this is followed by a war game which is very fiddly and seems artificial, ultimately leading to lots of dice rolling.  Goes through too much uninteresting formula to analyze.  I really wanted to like it (it was only $27 including tax), but it looks so NOT fun.

Also looks broken and scripted with less than 4 players, and others here agree.  Gave it away almost immediately.  Did not inspire me much.

The game combines two good ideas. First you have to win the elections in the different cities and once you are commander you go to war. Until now nothing but good and certainly worth a score of 9. But I was really disappointed in the manner how battles are solved. The defender has too much advantage. I fought some great battles, but the dices were always against me. I'm not against dices, but a lot of times only the throw of the dices was deciding. Wallace normally uses dices in a better way.

Played once as a 5-player game with the rules explained to me.  I was confused at first as to how exactly to fight a war, but after a painful round of combat I understood the rules better.  I had also read a lot of negative comments about the dice, but from my one experience I found the charts both interesting and fun.  

The area control phase was good for I liked promoting/assasinating candidates.  However, if players decide to all gang up on the same player, the fun factor (for me) would plummet.  I also liked that players became invested in certain cities.  This certainly made the wars more interesting.  Anyway, as with most Martin Wallace games, I am interested in playing this one again.

Hmmmm, I guess I did enjoy Perikles quite a bit. However, the game has a steep learning curve. After 3 games, I still had no idea what I was doing. There are basically 2 different games here. On one hand, you have the bidding election phase where you try to gain control of the armies. Then, there is the whole battle phase. That's the phase I just can't do well in! I am never sure how many units to committ to one battle or whether or not to assist another player. If YOU are interested in the game, mine is in great condition!

This number might rise much higher upon further plays, or much lower.  There's either a lot going on, which you really can affect, or you are doing a whole lot of nothing throughout the game.  Possibly falls into the place of too much AND too little dice rolling (too much to make the dice randomness a minor factor, too little to even out the rolls themselves). 

But an interesting system nonetheless.  Took a longer time to play than expected, but am looking forward to trying it again.

I wasn't that thrilled by this game. However, I didn't really figure out what to do until a good portion into it, and by then it was too late to recover from my earlier moves. For example, I'd been trying to set myself up for future elections instead of trying to take current ones, but that backfired badly; I think it's better to get what you can when you can. Despite my initial luke-warm reaction to this game, I've been thinking about it a lot lately, so I think I'd like to try it again. Cheap copies are around, so maybe I'll pick one up [and I did].

It's a simple to explain Wallace game that steps completely back and lets the player decide how the game will play out.  The share incentive of multiple players leading the same city makes for some interesting late game alliances while the players who stood back early in the game have the chance of leading several city-states in the end ensuring the game isn't over till it's over.

Martin Wallace seems to like making games where everyone is invested in many of the same things and forces them to fight it out.  This is a more streamlined and tight design than Libert√© or Byzantium, but it's also much more bland.  You spend a lot of time setting up for the battles, and then you roll lots of dice and, really, you are very much totally at their mercy no matter how good your strategy.  It's a chaotic game that should be more fun, but it isn't.  But of course if you are like some people who haven't met a Martin Wallace design they didn't like, then by all means you should buy it.

RATING: 4
It's not a typical battle game, as the victory conditions are variable, and each player is given a role to play.

Unfortunately, there is a bit of a script to it, and like other such games, you lose if you don't follow the script.

We finished this game and dismissed it.. but then we started talking about it, and there was a sense that something was there.  There's one thing I think we can all agree on: the combat system is iffy.  We're probably going to implement our own house rule for combat, and enjoy the other two parts of the game.

RATING: 8
A cracking game which is classic Wallace - rooted in the history of the period but with players capable of taking an interest in all the main city states - not always for altruistic reasons.  Somewhat reminiscent of Princes of the Renaissance in that respect (a good thing to my mind) but this is a different game with its own subtleties to explore.

RATING: 7
Very cool combination of area control/wargame where there are many tough decisions and ways to score points.  It appears as if there are multiple successful strategies you could employ in this one.  I also really liked the battle mechanism, where the outcome of the battle is never certain until it's over.  While the game borrows established game mechanisms, I can't say that I've played a game with this feel before; another good Martin Wallace design!

[5/11/2006]- More streamlined mechanics than Struggle of Empires and Princes of the Renaissance. You don't get heaps of tiles with special properties you need to familiarize yourself with. Therefore, I don't see how anyone could call this one 'fiddly'. It's quite the opposite.

I wonder whether the early leader/kingmaker syndrome is too strong and makes it all too easy to bring down a leader to the pack. Struggle of Empires' solved this problem haunting multiplayer games admirably. Perhaps some restrictions (e.g. democratic vs. oligarchic factions) might have been a good idea so as to allow a player to hang on to a lead in the political part of the game. Looks to me you can absolutely get stomped in that area, losing lots of influence, if your rivals join ranks against you.

RATING: 7
Provisional rating after a few plays. I'm highly impressed. It's probably my favorite Wallace game after Struggle of Empires.

Still looking for a Wallace game I like.  This game exemplifies a trademark of some Wallace games. Good Euro mechanics but combined with wargame mechanics that are terrible.  The dice battles in this game decide the winner of this game and they are pretty lame considering how much they are worth and how detached they are from the meat of the game.  You put all this effort and time into the board position and realize that it is not all that important.  It is just not engaging at all to me.

RATING: 6
Determining the governorship of each city phase is quite abstract. There's potential for analysis paralysis and general screwage and if your candidates are repeatedly assassinated you will lose out on the lucrative points for governorships. I'd rate this an '8' if there was a limit to how often your candidate could be assassinated.

I like the deploying forces for war phase (those with more 'two shard' tiles have to commit their forces earlier) and the idea of refighting the famous battles of Ancient Greece. Being able to control the Persians if you have no Greek forces is a clever idea and still gives you a chance to win victory points for battles (well, one battle, maybe). 

The components are the usual Warfrog quality but the many small rules are difficult to find in the 'wall of text' that Martin Wallace invariably uses.

Interesting mechanics revolving around two phases in which you play an area majority type election game and then, if you win some cities, you get to deploy the city forces in some predetermined battles.

RATING: 8
9 plays (2x3p, 4x4p, 3x5p)- First impressions... Impressive game. The rules aren't heavy, but the decision-making sometimes is (maybe better put: making decisions while trying to see--especially while still learning--what they fully mean). It's amazing to discern more and more how the rules lead to a web of interrelated values that small decisions impact. Much I like: the trickiness, fresh mechanic combos, the shifting and fractional player alliances, and many choices relating to the battles. If El Grande is juggling on quicksand, this is juggling on quicksand while whistling Mozart. Tense, difficult, gripping... The dice rolls (heretic wargame simulation dice abstractions) are exciting--I like the battle mechanics a lot.  Also I'm appreciating the idiosyncratic manner how the game does seem to suggest many elements of the war. *** Update, played with 5 players wow, great fun. Exciting and a bit wild.(Both Athens and Sparta burnt to the ground.) The web of point values we began to perceive made the politics part of the game even more political. ***Update, played with 4 people including newbies... There were maybe 6 or 7 battles with no attacker... this denies the active defender the VP of the tile (but 2 influence cubes).  I think this hurt my score - interesting tactic! The abstraction of the ancient history seems so pure and right. The way the politics and battles mesh together seems so diabolical, Clausewitzian.  You want to win battles for battle VPs, certainly, but also to hurt and destroy cities to lower their value to their player-leaders. The military-political relationship also works the other direction... For example, I was surprised to realize the specific martial impact of political assassinations--denying the opponent the influence cubes to spend on additional military placements. I hadn't thought about that before this session. So I'd say this is a tremendously well thought out game with euro-rarified machine of ancient greek history, but given a spark of animal spirits by dice. I want those animal spirits. Without the dice, it could still be a well-designed game, but not one I'd be excited about playing. But that does mean the luck is a factor and fate can foil your plans "unfairly". (I wonder if fate tilts against Athens in this game, with all the battle tiles with her name on it. This helps give the game some flavor. Also, the fact that the Spartan-controlling player chooses who goes flavor also helps twist the wheel of fate against Athens. Of course, players are not city-states, but families, Venn Diagram tendencies of pan-Greek interests.) With 5 players and rules explanation, it took 3 hours, fun the whole time. Another time with 5, failed in mood with some learning gamers who maybe brought the wrong attitude to the shifting coalitions of this game, or maybe the medium-heavy Euro complexity was too hard a curve under competition, leading to frustration. Not for new gamers, not for everyone, but I like it a lot, like the heretic design. I consider the experience fragile--can be excellent. I made individual tile set player mats to help players understand what city tiles they can pick and which they can't because they already picked them. This also helps other players see at a glance where others' tile sets stand in the selection phase.

RATING: 8
Underrated Martin Wallace game.  I play with the alternate CRT to save time.  Wonderful game of positioning.  

Update: Still interesting, but can be a bit laborious.  Also, I find Wallace's read of Grecian history quite interesting.  He totally dissolves the national (city-state) narrative and instead uses pan-Peloponnese actors to guide/influence the otherwise irrational actions of the cities.  If you think about the little cubes as physical people this obviously breaks down rather quickly into just another pasted on theme.  But, if you consider them diplomatic influence (a plausible deduction given the degree of contact between the city-states), the game comes alive.  In this respect, the player's portion approaches that of Liberte.

Its a Wallace game, so there are some things that I like about it and some things that I don't. I would rather have a blind draft of the tiles like in Magic than the time consuming face up version that he uses, also I think that it is odd the way that you are limited to only picking up one of any particular city, I have a feeling that this was a bit of spackle that was added at the end of development to create more player interaction during the Voting phase, but it feels a bit forced.

Still I really really like the theme, so I will probably play this one every few years.

RATING: 8.5
One of the better Martin Wallace games in the last few years.

Perikles has a nice finite structure in terms of game length. There is quite a bit more decision-making and strategy at the chits you choose than at first glance...and manipulating the value of the governorships provides for some great convolutions (a Wallace trademark, but well-done here). 

Some may feel the combat is too luck-sensitive (because there are dice), but there are enough ways to manipulate that with special chits, allies, etc, that you pretty much know what your odds are. There are occasional surprises, but overall I have no problem with this mechanic. A treat to play, and easier to get on the table than some of Wallace's other similar weight games.

RATING: 6
This game really held my interest well. I enjoy the euro area majority portion, and the battles are actually quite fun as well. The only blemishes here for me are the fiddly rules for placement of armies, but once you get the hang of them I think this is a very rewarding experience. 

*update* I think this game has a ton going for it, but I have definitely begun to feel that bad luck can really destroy a person quickly in this game. It is frustrating to make good tactical decisions and lose the battle by a string of bad dice rolls, especially since so many points can ride on a single battle.

Boy oh boy are the rules horribly written. Makes me feel right at home with a Warfrog game. But this is kinda nifty. Somewhat like PotR, the spatiality of war has been completely eliminated. Cities have preconstructed batches of units at their disposal, granted to the single player to be the leader of each city per round. The more cities you control, the more armies you get. And there's an interesting underlayer where you can get points by completely ignoring leading cities altogether. I really like the mechanic where two players from each city get nominated, rather than strictly by majority in the city. Very nice. In retrospect, I think that aspect of the game is more important than the committing of troops. Update after 2nd play: Rating 8->9.

Bought the game at Spiel 2008, where again it was offered for the bargain price of ‚Ç¨15. I resisted in 2007, I did not resist in 2008. The first game went terribly awry with my players not understanding one bit what needed doing. I was largely responsible for this fiasco due to a botched explanation, but I could also see that the dice luck in this game would be a killer for me. I'm marking this game up for sale.

[b]Update[/b] The game left my collection without getting a second chance. I was not up to the task of attempting to explain the rules again, and in the end I suspect the effort would have been largely wasted anyway.

Everything I had hoped it to be.  Definitely some nice decisions on what to do in this one.  First place in our one game went to the aggressor of the city that didn't get attacked much.  I spent too much time defending Athens and Sparta.

GAH! I hate this game.  Not for the game itself, mind you. Martin Wallace always makes a game that is self contained and usually not broken. (Brass, being an exception).

But Perikles- If the game had been about the Hanseatic States in the Baltic, maybe I'd like it more. But the conception of how politics 'worked' in the 6th-4th century Greece is SOOO off base in this game, that it just doesn't work for me.  

The key conceit of the game is that you, as the player, have members of your 'group' who have influence in multiple city states.  (Just what this group IS is left somewhat undefined).  In some cities you might have a majority, in most you'll be a minority.

Except- 
The Poleis didn't WORK like that. A Greek Poleis, or City State, was a TRIBAL element. EVERYONE who lived there was a member of the same ethnic 'group', with their own unique dialect, religious cult, and social values.

More to the point, they HATED the other cities- and distrusted those who came from 'outside'. So much so, that they created a word to describe those rare individuals who had friends and relations from outside thier little home- Xenophillia, or a 'Lover of Strangers'.

Bad enough that the average Euro is divorced from its theme. But, to me, its intolerable when it gets its theme WRONG.

Half euro, half wargame. Not perfect but very fun and you don't know the scores really until the very last turn.

There are two ways to score points - battles and cities. I feel like taking over the high point cities is a much better strategy than going for the cities with lots of armies. Battles can be pretty random with a couple great dice rolls changing everything. Not quite enough important dice rolls to even out the luck.

As a Martin Wallace fan, this has been on my to-play list for ages, but since I missed Essen last year I hadn't ever gotten it in. We played it today, with one player who'd already played before trying to teach it. We didn't get the rules all down quite right and made a few mistakes here and there but eventually got the gist.

The game more or less breaks down into an influence phase and a combat phase. The influence phase is fun and has a lot of tough choices. In the combat phase, deciding where to place troops is fun and also has lots of tough choices.

The combat resolution though, um, not so fond of it. It seems clunkier than it needs to be and although it is statistically based die rolling based on the relative strengths of the armies, it seemed that there were often far more rolls than felt right. You just keep rolling til someone succeeds twice, which can be quite a while. Dice controlled combat is always a double edged sword - on the one hand, you want some random element because bullets don't always hit their target even with a good marksman. OTOH, it really stinks when you have a "bad dice karma" day. In this game, my dice karma was quite good but other people really got shafted.

So my final verdict is mixed. I'd play it again but the combat resolution just doesn't sit right with me. I prefer Struggle of Empires' dice rolling even though I've been bitten really bad with dice karma in that game, it just seems cleaner there.

A nice, Peloponnesian War flavored euro, with a dash of wargame tossed in. It's a good crossover game, so if you're a wargamer trapped in room full of eurogamers, you just might be able to get them to join in a game or two. The fact that I seem to have a knack for this game helps boost my rating.

The main knock against this game by others is the combat system. I think it's fine, but most of the euro crowd hates it, probably because they hate dice in general and/or lost a bunch of battles in their limited experience. So yes, there's a little bit of luck to the game, but unit placement and knowing your odds is an integral part to mastering this game, but I've found that most eurogamers are just bad at it. Thus, people complain that the dice screwed them when really they probably just didn't manage their force allocation properly.

Anyway, ignore the haters. Great game.

The experience is raw and calculating without being overly adversarial. Definitely play again.

There are lots of wasy to hurt others via battles, but even moreso by manipulative nominations during the elections!

Played once.  There's a good game here, but it's almost totally obscured by poorly written rules -- scan the postings on the Geek here for many, many clarifications.  It's also a Martin Wallace design, so it's opaque by nature -- expect a few playings to get the strategy down.  I consider this a strength; don't expect a "one and done" playing of this game.  There's depth here that needs a few playings to explore -- you just have to wade through the rules.  Having an experienced player teach you this game is the way to go, as it is for many Wallace designs.

My major comment at the moment is that with 5 players it is too long (4 hours +) for what it is delivering.  One game ended early due to a Spartan loss, but we were playing some rules slightly wrong.  We now wonder how it plays with 4 players, and I think I would want to give that a try before making any further comments.

This is my third M. Wallace game and by far this is the most complete.  La Strada is a mesh of pointless tile-laying and road building; nothing original or entertaining.  Age of Steam is a brilliant game but so unforgiving that a single mistake in the early game can put you permanently behind with no chance for redemption.  Perikles, however, is a work of art.  I can be quite fussy about what I like to have in a game, how things should be balanced and how much control I feel is needed to make the challenge fun for all.  I rarely get to see truely new mechanisms which are so seamlessly implemented as the duality of politics and warfare as is found in this great game.  The opportunities for diplomacy, strategy and skulldudgery are cleverly woven to offer plenty of options without bogging down the rulebook or the play of the game.  Brilliant game.

My first play was lots of fun.  It will go up if I get to play it more.  You have to spend some time working on the rules to really teach the game well. I wish the combat wasn't as fiddly as it is (make it quicker like Byzantium).  There are lots of little tiles to sort    through as you play as well.  Unlike a hand of cards, it's fiddly trying to peek at all your army tiles.  Too bad they couldn't be small cards or something.  The artwork isn't too hot (doesn't say ancient Greece to me at all...) and the game has less of a wargame feel than other Wallace games I love(Struggle of Empires and Byzantium).  Perhaps the lack of a map makes the combat feel more abstracted.  Still, I'd like to play again.  Like all Wallace games the strategic options are varied and that's what I love about his games.

Note: we played a five player game and I had the Persian rule wrong (I underpowered it).  That messed over a player, but otherwise it was very fun.

A very solid game, one I will always enjoy whenever I get 4 to 5 players to go with it. It's not complex when it comes to explaining rules (even if the combat system, or more the alliances system is sometimes hard to grasp at first) but it have surprising depth when we start to see how every step in our turn works with the other players - even taking a single tile during Influence round can screw some other players planning, and after a few games you can see how the simple mechanics are woven together like a well oiled machine.

The only problem is combat, which is a solid bit random, and even with overwhelming numbers you can still lose to a misfortune of dice and get a major bad feel when all your plans get foiled by just a few throws...

Still, a tense, quite quick game that require constant attention throuought the whole session!

A little disappointed, but this was an earlier game than my favorites from Martin Wallace. I purchased this in 2014. Basically, you're programming a bunch of battles to take place, and then you go down the column of eight or so battles and roll dice to resolve them. Throwing the weight of your forces on different sides is a little interesting, but overall not a good use of time. 

I really like the elections and how they influence scoring at the end. Martin Wallace always does neat election mechanics.

First: take some thought decision.
Second: roll lots of dice. Dice wins, not the strategy.

It's the same old error: if one wants to put dice in a game he/she has to the decisions phase AFTER the roll of dice. 
As usual, Wallace have had very good ideas but the random/fiddly elements totally broke the game.

RATING: 4
I can't recall the last time I rated a rather well-regarded game from a top designer so poorly.  Almost every minute I didn't like this game. Most of the decisions that can be made are so restricted and often I hated the choices between options. Games that excite me make multiple choices equally tantalizing. In this one, I was choosing the best from a bunch of boring choices. And this was just the tile placement phase. The combat uses hidden information loaded onto the table and then revealing that information to conform to a funky CRT (yes.. a CRT in a modern Euro/wargame hybrid) and then rolling dice and then rolling dice and then rolling dice some more until somebody wins the battle. If you like rolling dice, this will be okay. If you like sitting around for many minutes watching other people rolling and rolling dice to resolve combat, then you might not be so thrilled about your down time. Also, ugly components and a board that would never pass QC these days (I hope!) A couple of "take that" bonus cards thrown in there to unhinge your plans. Just plain awful.  I like games where you have to react to player moves and this game has it and maybe just barely I liked that aspect. But that is done in other games in much better ways.  A thoroughly un-Wallace Martin Wallace game.

One of the three Martin Wallace¬¥s underdogs in my book along with Princes of Renaissance and Libert√©. This is a fantastic game, that has more similarities with Princes of Renaisance in the existence of a subtle web of interaction among the player¬¥s interests and targets. A tremendous game that is a better option than PoR if you dont like auctions (although I do think PoR is still a slighty better design). Perikles has a lot of personality, tons of interaction and many dice rollings that some people hate. Luck is an important factor here, but I couldn¬¥t care less.

First game ended really quickly because of inexperience a tons of mistakes in the first round. Basicly we just ended it after concluding that the winner has pretty much been resolved at that point.

I enjoyed my first play quite a bit, but I suspect that Perikles will go down as one of Martin Wallace's minor works.  Wallace has once again succeeded in creating interesting, multifaceted decisions for the players, but I didn't find that spark of excitement that would have put the game over the top.  It's a little bland.  I'm also worried that the open, easily calculable scoring presents some problems in the endgame.  Finally, I think the battle system is much more convoluted than it needs to be.  Overall, Perikles seemed like "Princes of the Renaissance Junior Edition," and think I'd rather go whole hog for the real thing.

Martin Wallace shines again with another very very intersting, charming and beautiful game. It's a mastery of blending mechanics. There's a lot of hearty flavor to this deep game. I need more plays, but it seems that controlling Sparta is the heart of the game, it's hard to beat he who controls Sparta.

Good idea, bad game.  Very clunky systems, and very inelegant rules.  I don't mind the die luck at much as the random turn order luck.  Almost imposable to plan ahead, leaving strategy thin.  Hidden army placement and unpredictable placement order leaves you with no stat calculation for battles, so you basically are playing it safe or risking it all.  Combat is overly complex and clunky.  Lots of "wrong place wrong time" screwage, that I can't stand.  Overall a great theme idea, but horribly executed.  Somehow manages to be both a poor Euro, and a poor wargame at the same time.

RATING: 10
Can't stop thinking of how wonderful this game is - very clever area control mechanism (in both cities and during wars) with some luck involved. Brilliant.

Review - to be written.

My initial rate was 9.5 but after third play, when really the game 'clicked on' me, I had to rate it up to 10 where it will remain forever.

In this game everything is perfect. If I were to name one shortfall it would be the game proneness to AP - particularly when deploying the units some people tend to stall the gameplay. Otherwise - it is the best game in the world. Period.

RATING: 6
The game has an interesting mix of mechanics, but not much fun in it. The election part is nice, but possibly too much dependent on luck of the draw, even with the card drafting. Combat is very abstract, combining blind bidding a la "Aladdin's Dragons" to die rolls. It's also time-consuming, and I really felt no need for the dice. Although there are thematic elements (Sparta has the strongest forces, etc.), the map has no relevance to anything, which adds to the overall abstractness. Besides, the board is very ugly and dull. Nonetheless, the game works well and I'd play it again, but I don't look forward to it.

Too much direct screwage and confrontation for my taste.  Losing pieces just for being nominated is punishing.  Basically someone at the table can decide that you won't win and make it happen.

Wallace and I don't really get along, and my first play left me feeling that this game was too random. It is random if you don't play carefully.
Perikles, like some wargames with rigid diplomacy conditions (Here I Stand and The Napoleonic Wars spring to mind), requires that you plan your turn very carefully around whom you wish to attack. Overreach (often, by doing things like controlling Athens and Sparta at once) and you might have no way to get points for a turn; i.e., 33% of the game. That, and the battle allocation part takes way too long for what it is, namely a series of small decisions.
All that said, the area influence part of the game is brilliant--and the way it meshes with the battles is great. All told, I think Perikles shines despite its flaws. This and Byzantium are my favourite Wallaces by far.

Fast moving game that can be played in under 2 hours.

Tense elections and battles. 

Victory is decided by victory points which are added up at the end of the game. These VPs can be earned by winning battles, winning elections and by the influence cubes on the board at the end of the game. Battle results can affect the final value of election victories. 

I like the fact that the games I have played have generally been close. There haven't been obvious winners or losers until the VPs had been added up. The results often surprise us.

A good game, but not really my style.  It took us like 2 hours, and I couldn't help but feel that what I was doing didn't matter too much as long as I didn't do anything totally stupid.  In the end, we were all within 4 victory points of each other.  Could any of us have played better?  I'm not sure how.  I've come to the conclusion I just don't like Martin Wallace that much.  All of his games feel totally soulless.  They usually have a lot of conflict, but it rarely feels important.  Its usually just 2 hours of going through the motions combined with an artificially close scoring mechanism.

They seem like the least likely designs to appeal to me, and yet when I play them I have a great time.

My dice phobia somehow doesn't kick in, and the garish abstracted board becomes appealing.

Assassinating your own electoral candidate feels like so much fun : how many other games allow for such delicious wickedness.

An outstanding design in terms of theme, mechanics, and play. It's a wargame cloaked inside an area influence game, or is it the other way around? It plays and feels more like a Euro, and not as wargame-y, as the combat has been abstracted and distilled to the essentials--roll a certain "to hit" number, and with the first to win two advantages (sounds like tennis) wins in each of two phases. While there is randomness, the superior force will generally win. There are some subtle tactical concerns, as battles are fought on land and/or sea, and this introduces tension and drama as the dice are thrown. The types of units one can bring to the various battles (which score VP) are determined by gaining political influence in a given city that will provide the units. Strategically, players must do well in the influence portion of the game, to get descent units to do well in the war portion of the game. The influence portion is full of political intrigue, with many options besides gaining majority. It is this seamless coupling of the two aspects that makes the game so fascinating and innovative. A definite winner, but only for those who like meat in their games.

Above average for a Martin Wallace game, but I do worry that he's well into the zone of recycling earlier ideas.

Fiddly rules, and unpredictable results.  There are so many pieces here that it is hard to see how they will all fit together, though the first game at least is something of a discovery.  The game becomes much more vicious toward the end, when values are clearer and it is certain that there will be no more rounds. But the political round seems fraught with significance that isn't quite understood, and the combat round.. gives a different picture.  Is that a letdown? I'm not sure. Rating could rise. (1 play)

First try with 3 players. Perikles is cleaner (fewer fiddly rules and components) and more abstract than previous Warfrog games. The core mechanics of the game are relatively simple, but the interactions between the different elements, and their effects on victory points, are far from straightforward and made this first game very tense and thought-provoking. I think a second try and familiarity with the composition of the military forces and the location tiles will be necessary before I start to develop a feel for the potential strategies in the game. Perikles seems less strongly-themed but better designed than other Warfrog Games, and yet the use of dice and conditions for ending the game early constitute the unmistakeable Wallace hallmark.

In general, Wallace seems to design with my tastes in mind.  He has been uneven, but not so with Perikles.  This one hits the sweet spot.  Its about 2 hours, but they fly by pretty well.  It has lots of little clever nods to history, but is still more Euro than wargame.  The thing I really admire about this design is the clever interplay between the political (very Euro-ee) phase of the turn, and the combat (very Ameritrashy) elements.  Its full of inviting tactical nuance and the dynamics between the two weave seemingly disparate games into a satsifying whole.  One important thing, read the threads here on combat resolution.  These questions WILL come up on your first game.  I can see this hitting a 9 with further play.

Lots of interaction here as usual for a Wallace title, also lots of interesting strategic elements which were subtle but also expected.

Fairly unique I thought save the similiarites to POTR, I do like that title more than this but this was good as well. 

The big downfall here is the dice rolls, you can slant them in your favour but luck can rear its ugly head at some bad times. Dice do bring out some fun in the battles but can also thwart your plans. With less luck in combat this could have easily been an 8 for me. 

Very interesting overall though with some possible alliances, lots to think about, multiple paths and fun.

Not my favorite Wallace game, but a worthy effort. It feels a bit like a mish-mosh of standard Wallace mechanics... area control, bidding, conflict, playing both sides of a fence ect... It's still better than most games out there nowadays imo, but Wallace is easily one of my favorite designers.

Really like this game.   There is dice rolling which may turn off some Euro players, but you cannot win combat on a single roll, so one really lucky roll is not enough, which tempers the luck factor.   The theme works for me too.

I like Martin's designs as far as Euro's go, but I'm not a war gamer, and while this is not technically a war game but kind of a cross over, it's too war gamey for me where there is too much luck of the dice rolls (and you have to roll a lot in the combat phase).

Well, I still don't much like Warfrog's games although this certainly wasn't as painful an experience for me as Struggle of Empires was. :-)

Being a big fan of thematic euros, I like the efforts that *have* been put into supporting the theme. Slave revolts, plague, named battles, Athens having a strong navy, that kind of thing. Still, apart from those little chromey bits, I don't think the design - the basic engine of the game, if you will - gives me much understanding of the history behind the theme: Gaining influence in the city states is basically an abstract, typical euro'ish area influence / cube placement mechanic (albeit a good one), and fighting battles resembles more a series of free-for-all, hit-the-leader opportunities and not so much an epic struggle between two ideologically opposed states.

Since free-for-all, hit-the-leader games are a genre of games I dislike, I didn't think much of the military aspects of Perikles. The area influence game to gain control of cities worked quite nicely, though, but that bit was also the most abstract part of the game.

My first game ran for about 3 hours, which I think is *much* too long. That much of the time was spent with the kind of wheeling and dealing I don't care for, didn't make it better.

WOW Perikles really surprised me and I enjoyed it a lot. For me it has some elements reminiscent of Princes of the Renaissance (I haven‚Äôt played Struggle of Empires yet). The games rules are easy to grasp and the game flows quickly. You only play three turns, each with many phases so if you have 5 fast players it is a blast. It is definitively best with 5 players, the problem is the increased downtime.

I really like how the votes (area control) are handled in each city, the player who wins the election will control the army of that city and the armies are VERY important for the battle phase. Sparta¬¥s and Athena‚Äôs army and navy are, respectively, the strongest in the game, so there is a lot of votes going for those cities, however most battles will be fought in places these two cities control, it is a nice balancing mechanism.  I also really like the battles, they are fought (generally) in two fronts. 

There is some luck in the order the city tiles appear, the battles that are going to be fought and (obviously) the dice that decide each battle, but you can mitigate it with jokers (for the city tiles), planning (for the battles) and adding more soldiers or making alliances to improve your chances rolling the battle dice. There are very interesting choices in each phase (where to put my influence cubes, Should I start/support this battle? With whom should I ally myself? Should I defend this city?) making the game very tense until the end. You are never sure to win a battle, no matter how overwhelming are your forces, the defender always have at least a mathematical probability at winning. 
 
The game components and art is ok.

On the bad side, the rules aren‚Äôt very clear and Perikles feature the ‚Äúattack the perceived leader‚Äù mechanism I have come to loath these days but as the game plays so fast and it is very tense, I currently don‚Äôt mind much about this.

Bottom line, Perikles is a good game, a keeper in my game collection and I want to explore It further. It is refreshing to see another good Wallace game, lately he has become more miss than hit for me but I still have faith in him. Perikles was way better than expected, I was expecting a regular game because I bought two copies of it very cheap.

Single play (plus solo run throughs to get the rules) to date.

Excellent Warfrog game. Some posters on BGG have said this isn't one of Martin Wallace's best, but I disagree - I really enjoyed it.

Three different ways to score points (battle tiles, influence cubes on board at game end, and statues build to commemorate your city leaders). You can major in one of them or mix them up. 

The points on the battle tiles the players have won are clear for all to see, but the points for cubes on board and (especially) statues will vary through play.

You need to keep an eye on how the others are doing, while bearing in mind the trade off between activities aimed at pegging back the lead players and activities that will improve your own score.

In summary, a (relatively) short playtime and fairly simple mechanics combined with a good mix of strategy and player interaction mean I'm looking to play this one again soon.

Perikles has plenty going for it. This is my favorite historical period, so that's an instant plus. The idea of politics as the means by which you gain control of military forces is a fantastic design choice. The influence and voting mechanics are tense and well-designed, which lead to layers of decisions and subtleties. However, it is the combat system that falls flat for me. While I appreciate the move away from rolling ad nauseum, the pendulum swings too far the other way here. After a carefully executed political phase that lasts 30-45 minutes, having so much hinge on a few battles that last mere seconds is a bit dissatisfying to me. In my first game, I was a bystander to a battle in which the attacker outnumbered the defender 9:1 yet lost because of a couple of bad rolls. This would be fine in a light filler, but seems to be a dubious element in a game of this depth. There are some very enjoyable concepts here, but the brevity and sheer luck of the combat system make for an anticlimactic experience.

28.11.2007: I've played a solitaire 3-player test game to get a feel for the rules. The rules are quite simple and easy to understand. Combat is fast and simple, but there is a lot of dice rolling (dice phobics should be aware of that). Looks very promising and there are lots of hard decisions to make in the game. I liked it and look forward to a game with real opponents.

Interesting game where you vie for the control of regions in order to control its army in the hopes of gaining victory points in battle. I really enjoyed the first half of each round as each player looks to gain influence and nominations in the regions. However, the battle portion of the game really seemed to drag as players place their army units face down over four rounds then the battle is resolved in two phases determined on a battle table. If this portion of the game can be sped up this could be a buy for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Perikles is played over three turns, with which each turn separated into a majority game to determine who controls the city-states and their armies and then a blind-bid wargame over victory point tiles. The cities you control limit which tiles you can attack and which you can defend. You get points at the end of the game for having controlled cities, but those points are diminished if the city loses battles. You also get points for having influence cubes on the board and, of course, the VP tiles your city-states have won.

Because players can support each other in battle in some cases, (in order to ensure the city-state points for a third player gets reduced, for example) there can be a lot of politicking that goes on over and above the mechanics as written. This is where the real interest in the game lies as the mechanics themselves are a little dull and the constant rolling and rolling of two dice multiple times for every battle in succession is a bit monotonous. So, it can be quite a group-dependent game. 

These days I feel like there are more richly designed games that play in the same space and don't have the mechanics that I dislike in this one: blind-bidding armies to either side and consulting odds tables and rolling dice. There are even a few Wallace games that offer similar politicking opportunities in a more interesting framework, like Princes of the Renaissance and Struggle of Empires. For this reason, I don't need to revisit this one again.

You are trying to gain influence in the various greek cities. If you have the most pieces you can win an election and control the army for that city. Then you attack other cities and roll dice to get hits based on a table of the ratio of attacker to defender strength. You gain VPs from winning the battles, from winning elections (at game end), and from having pieces on the board at game end. Cities that lose battles give less VPs at game end. There is also the occassional assasination. It has a light, fun wargame feel.

Perikles is typical for Warfrog. Wallace constructs a system with some clever ideas and sinks everything with a few big blunders. The political system is great. Whoever wins the struggle for control of a city is controlling its armies for the following battles. The brillant twists are the assymetric city powers and the leader voting enabling players to gain control even if they haven't the strongest influence in a city. The battles are where Perikles falls apart. Battles are resolved with two D6 and a single battle can easily be worth 20% of the total score. There aren't enough battles to compensate for one or two unlucky losses. Add to this a total lack of restrictions who to attack and you have a nearly random kingmaking fest which can take up to three hours. 
My pet peeve with Wallace's games are the rough corners. In Perikles it is the disjoint between the influence tiles taken and using them again for placing armies. It's as odd as the card usage in Brass.

Perikles's hybrid design, blending the political and the military, area majority and combat, is intriguing, but the game is not all that entertaining. It's clearly not a wargame, but it's also too much of a straightfoward combat game to please many Euro fans; at the same time, the combat is abstract in the extreme, coming down to who puts more in hoplites and/or triremes in a given city and who rolls better. There is some pleasing tension in the way that political success--that is, gaining command of cities' forces--may just set you up for military failure, such as when you have to defend your newly won cities against attacks, and the combat is not without charms. But it's a game that's neither flesh nor fowl, and the two aspects just don't work that well together for me.

For a Wallace title, surprisingly easy to learn and fast to play.  The theme is highly abstracted, and could be applied to just about any situation one would desire, but the mechanisms are unique and fun.  I like the restrictions on card drafting as well as the elections, both of which create some interesting decisions.  Though the battle phase really seems to come down to dice rolling, I like the way that alliances can be formed.  I would like to explore this title quite a bit more.

A pretty dry area-majority wargame. Its basically split into 2 halves. Firstly players try to use influence to win cities. Then, players use the armies from their cities to fight battles. Unfortunately, this game just didn't work very well with my group. No one really got very involved.

I think in this game you always feel more like a spectator. Maybe its because the game is too abstract or too simple. It just felt more of a clever game than a good one. Also, the battle system is a bit weak. You can't do anything special with it, you just place your highest numbers in the battle and hope to win.

Includes a slew of excellent and fairly (at least to me) original mechanics. They work well together and feel inctricately interactive. The game has alot of direct conflict though but near the end of a 3p game we found there was little value in fighting any of the batttles as it would hinder our own score more than others. For my gaming group this game lasts too long and has too strong a luck element for its length to see regular play so I'm trading this away.

Martin Wallace's Barry Lyndon. A curiosity, with some rather interesting ideas (just slightly before their time) that will be better developed later. Plus, the colors on the board are just dark enough that it feels like you're seeing it through a linen scrim.

The only real problem here is the luck of the dice, which can make or break a game. This has a lot more in common with Libert√© than Struggle of Empires or any of his other games. There are regions you want to win for now and then ruthlessly fuck up later, and there are regions you want to protect now, keep pristine, and exploit for VPs in the end.

I'm not sure this is much of an improvement over Libert√©, but it is quite good (and not too expensive!).

After reading (very confusing) rules we were very excited. After 2 games, we are very disapointed. The game mechanism looks very good on paper, in real they just don't work. It looks like there is a lot of options in phase one but as we experienced most of the time it ends in situation where all wait just for one tile. The fighting system is quite broken too. Too many dices, too many randomness. Round 3 of the game is probably the weakest point. In 2nd game we ended in pathetic situation. One player had big majority in 3 cities but he was only elected in one since there were no electing tiles but one so all the influence cubes were wasted. And I am not commenting "gaining 2 cubes to city you defend without attacking". What is point of that in 3rd round anyway? This game is trying to look like gamer's game but it's not. Definitelly not.

I feel like this needs more for me to really get it - so far it feels a little slow and anti-climactic.  But there is a hint of something more.  Needs more plays, so as it stands right now, I would play this almost any time.

Edit: with 4 plays now I feel like this is a firmly "good" game.  There is enough going on that I feel it is worth playing once in a while but downtime will keep this from ever being a "great" game for me.

Good strategic euro-wargame. The first phase consists of political elections to become the leader of a city, which is kinda area control, but the largest faction in a city doesn't necessarily decide the leader, due to the influence of the two candidate nominations. In the second phase, the leaders of the cities (and the army they control) will fight in a series of battles on historic locations. The resolution of the battles is done through dice rolls and this introduces a rather huge element of luck, which can completely negate the careful thinking from the first phase (don't really like this aspect of the game). At the end of the era, each of the leaders dies and becomes a statue (a nice touch). Victory points are gained for presence in the cities, winning battles and having statues in successful cities. Beware of the sudden-death ending when either Athens or Sparta loses four battles.

An involved integrated system of voting/influence for six states and blind-assignments of army tiles for winning battles.  It did remind me a little of Princes of the Renaissance but the dice rolling does have much more of an effect with the final scores.  As long as you understand this aspect, then this is a solid game and one that I wouldn't mind breaking out once in awhile.  The influence/election aspect is really interesting and, for me, the best part of the game.

RATING: 7
Like many Wallace games, it appears complex initially but becomes fairly straightforward in concept after playing the first round or so.  You are basically placing influence in efforts to control different city states that allow you expend armed forces in battle for victory points.  If you lose defending a city, that city takes a damage point and the value of future statues/leadership in that city declines (think stock market - if you win the election of a city state, you get a share but opposing players can make the value of that share decline if they defeat your city in battle).

Very good light wargame / area influence game.  There are really two games in one here with the struggle to control city states as it opens with an area control contest while the second half that consists of light wargame that allows players to use the military forces of their cities against one another.  There are some confusing aspects to the rules that are not terribly well handled in the instruction booklet but everything becomes fairly clear after the first round.

RATING: 7
A Peloponnesian War themed game...with the little cubes.  Plyed this with David and Simon.  The game works much to a good extent.  The game starts with placement of the influence markers in each of the cities on map. Athens, Sparta, Megara, Corinth, names of the ancient city states once glory. Then came the proposed leader who would lead the army into the battle if the leader has most of the influence markers in the game. 

There are 7 battles in one round. The place of battles are randomly drawn from the tiles. Each battle has a VPs for scoring. Ratios are calculated after deployment of the troops. The first one who score 2 hits after rolling two dices according to the required number according to the ratio column would win the battle and claim the battle. The leader would have a statue from the citizen as a trophy. On the other hand, the leader could be assassinated by a card with a knife picked up by a player. 

The naval battle takes place first. But the land battle would be the one to determine the final control. So if a player won a naval battle, he goes into the land battle with +1 hit advantage, more likely to win as he needs just only one more hit. 

So the game is a blast to play. It abstractly combines both politics and military actions to a successful degree.

The usual (for Wallace) mix of interesting decisions (in the political phase) and utter randomness (in the battles). The latter is particularly annoying here, since you need to roll two dice again and again.

Sorry- the game is not all that exciting to me.  More of the same from Wallace, but long and dull.  The combat system is poor, with dice rolls carrying the day more than clever play.  The rules are poorly done (again) and leave too many holes that players spend too much time trying to figure it out.  Not sure why M. Wallace games can't have clearly writen rules with good solid examples (more than 1 as well) and get the points across.  
Perikles is a sure hit for some, a sure miss for me.  Frankly, there's better Wallace games out there, and this one is merely a hodgepodge of elements that when it's all said and done, add up to a dull game where too much is left up to chance. Lastly, to give this a wargame ranking is laughable...

Apart from the fresh and fun interweavings of your actions and a short'n'sweet combat system - things you can hope for in a Wallace game - Perikles also offers a reasonably quick entry without having to digest two dozen different action tiles (a la Princes of the Renaissance or Struggle of Empires) before your first turn.

This made my first game much more than a more learning experience and leaves me hoping for a second game, soon.

Only one play but I did enjoy it. This is a negotiation game, (or it should be played as such) disguised as a euro.  There is also a fair amount of luck of the dice in the battles so that's a nice surprise for something that looks this euro. 

I would certainly play this Wallace game again. 

2nd play, and I still like it. Requires players who will engage in the negotiations required to make the game fun.

First impressions: 2 parts in this game, control area, very quiet and cerebral. combat: very vocal and with a little more luck factor. After 3 hour all my friend agree that it was a very entertaining game (we make 4-5 mistakes) but the feeling was very good.
After second game: probably the game is a little long ans susceptible to analysis paralysis, specially because the players known in a better way the tactics. 
UPDATED: after 5 plays, scale from 8.1 to 8.5. It is possible to play in a little more than 2 hours. More plays, better.

Initial rating: A typical Martin Wallace game in the sense that it's captivating & no downtime, various options, the possibility of temporary alliances, and the combination of wargame & strategic euro.

Or a non-typical Wallace because of the dice mechanism that's used to resolve the battles?

Good game, plays well with 3 (but is probably better with 4 or 5)

I don't know about this game. It almost makes no sense. Yes, it is an elegant design. Yes, it plays well. But the battles are lackluster. And the democracy employed in the cool elections had never been employed in the politics of all but one of the cities (as pointed out by my brother), and this broke the theme in half.

RATING: 7.5
Streamlined Wallace game that actually does play within 120 minutes.  I enjoyed how well the voting and fighting phases interacted with each other and the choices available in choosing where to defend or attack.  Although players may not have control of a city (via the vote) they may have had control of it at one time (which gives you a VP counter on that city) and thus still have a stake in defending it against attacks (which lower the end-game VP value of the city).  Looking forward to more plays.  I don't think it will have the shelf-life of Struggle but the fact that you can teach and play it much quicker may allow it to hit the table more often.  (2006-10)

UPDATE: Good game but not his most exciting.  Knocking rating down 1 point.

Game almost seamlessly integrates two sub-games as "phases": area control (bidding/election phase) and maximization of influence in military phase.  The integration is nice, and I especially enjoyed the euro-ness of the bidding phase (various options for putting out cubes and interacting with others' cubes, i.e. assignation and nomination).  Good value in tradeoffs; some re-playability to get better with strategic play choices.

After only one play, I would really like to play this one again. I think it's Martin Wallace's most refined design, and probably the most likely to be considered a "wauro"/"weuro"/whatever you want to call a euro with some "military" conflict.

EDIT: Three plays now and I can say I really like this game. It mixes area majority with battles of undetermine outcome. nfortunatly it is not a favorite among my fellow gamers, so it does not hit the table often

RATING: 7
Highly unique mechanics, but in my first game, I managed to win *in the first round* by luck of the dice - I was controlling Athens and Argos and in the combat phase, ended up going up against the player controlling Sparta in four different combats - defending in two of them and attacking in two. Although I was slightly or significantly outnumbered in all of those combats, I still managed to eke out a victory by pure dumb luck (in spite of dice odds!) and with four losses for Sparta the game immediately ended. As I was the one with the most VP there + the VP for Argos and Sparta, I won by a landslide.

I think this means the game is either 1)broken, 2)we were doing something significantly wrong, 3) too heavily based on luck.

Rating was for the good time and the interesting mechanics, but having played Struggle of Empires, I know there are superior Martin Wallace games out there.

------------------

Ratings bump from 6 to 7 after second play - it turns out that number 2) above was correct - we played with a number of rules MAJORLY wrong, so much so that this time that game was more balanced, tighter, and more fun than last time, and there was plenty the other players could do to mitigate the luck factor. I am still not happy about the dice element but I think I can live with it, all things considered. Makes me want to play Wallace's other games.

RATING: 8
The combat system seemed too luck-driven at first, but understanding that a 1:1 battle gives the attacker only a 30% chance of victory made it easier to digest.  All the combats but two in our second game went as expected.  This helped.

RATING: 6
Approached correctly (or at least with an open mind), Perikles can be a rewarding experience. For too long, I tried to view this as a game of high strategy, one in which you can outsmart your opponents through clever moves and long-term planning. Of course, the dice (everyone's #1 complaint about this game) challenged this notion from the start, but I started playing with a diceless variant that removed the luck while retaining the suspense of the battles.

Still, there's only so much control you have here. Everybody's going to add one or two Influence to each city in each Influence phase, and the minor variations here are driven largely by the luck of the tile draws. In essence, you're almost seeding the board randomly.

But if you have the right attitude, that's when the game really begins. Perikles, like the theme that inspired the game, is an inherently [i]political[/i] game. It's about forming alliances and setting yourself up so you're not a target or, when you are, the damage is minimal. Played in this vein, Perikles is almost like a shortened Diplomacy, with the Influence phase creating interesting shifts in power you then try to balance during the Combat phase. If everyone realizes this, then Perikles can be a very good game. But if it's all heads-down pondering and analysis, you'll be disappointed.

How can you design a game about the Pelopennesian War? One year a city state might be allied with Sparta, the next year the same city state might be allied with Athens. Not only does Perikles nail the theme of the Pelopennesian War, it's fun, tense, and each stage of its turn is filled with choices that influence the next in wonderful ways. A truly unique game!

Nice combination of voting (area control), battles and recreation of a historical period.  Perikles is really a very good game, which combines multiple concepts/mechanisms into one game playable in under 2 hours.  The voting/area control portion is very fun and leads to some tough choices.  The wargame side is a little more tedious, but still tense and enjoyable.  Although abstract, Perikles captures many aspects of the Peloponnesian War.  From a strategy perspective, Sparta%u2019s strong army is essential to win key battles and is only offset by Athens%u2019 even stronger navy.  Generally, you will need to control Sparta or Athens at some point to have a chance to succeed in the battle phase.

Perikles is still a very interesting blend of area control and combat, but the more I play it the more I realize that it's rather dependent upon the group playing.

In Ancient Greece, draft tiles to put cubes in one of six cities to elect leaders. The leader then gets to control the armies to fight for VPs in the battle phase. Armies are assigned to either attack or defend, and dice are rolled to resolve combat. The person with the advantage rolls at better odds, while the one with the disadvantage rolls at worse odds, and you conduct a trireme and a hoplite battle. Elected leaders then die off and become statues, which are worth VPs, provided the city has not taken many losses in the battle phase. At the end of the game, cubes left on cities are also worth VPs. This is a pretty decent Martin Wallace offering, reducing the luck of previous games, and it is a fairly straight forward game with easy mechanisms. I have played this with 3, 4 and 5 players, and in the 5 player game it is a viable strategy to take the Persians. There is lots going on and many things to think about in this game. I don' think the luck is as bad as Wallace's other games, and there are less random bugger tiles which are usually a feature of his games. I would say this is Wallace's best offering out of his games such as Princes of the Renaissance, Struggle of Empires, Liberte, etc.

Perikles...he's pretty worthless in Mare Nostrum, and the game named after him is quite flawed as well.  The problem here is that each player is participating in politics and warfare to a pretty equal extent.  The game doesn't really allow you to chase extra victory points in one area while neglecting the other;  everyone does the same stuff.  Thus, the dice-based combat has much more impact on the final scores than I would like.  There just isn't a lot of room for skillful play here.  Byzantium is a much better Wallace Waro (or Weuro, or whatever the hell they're called), in my opinion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Perikles would be perfect if it packed in as much fun in 2/3rds the time.  The completely open nature of scores sadly makes it prone to a fair amount of AP, and the though the individual decisions are all relatively small steps, the shear number of options further promote longer play time.

I like the potential for clever play and quickly changing allegiances.  If play time could be brought down to two hours this would see an easy boost in my rating.

I know most people will disagree.  However, I don't like games that try and balance politics and warfare because they usually cannot do it well.  I find Perikles failing miserably in trying to achieve both.  The combat system should either be simplified so it is more of a political game (which I think is best), or the politics should be greatly reduced so that it is an all out war game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
In the political phase of the game, it feels like it's too easy for someone to kill off another player's candidate. You position in each city can be tenuous. For battles, it seems like it is in a player's interest to invest in extra cubes for their city, in order to gain extra armies. Athens and Sparta should have several extra cubes, since they have much stonger armies. The bluffing aspect of the battle setup can be difficult to work with, since you can never be sure how large of a force you need to assign. It's probably worth it to add extra units to get away from even odds.

I've read over and over how brilliant Martin Wallace's games are, and this was the first one I purchased and played. Aside from substandard writing in the rulebook--not an insurmountable problem--I have to throw my hat in the ring and echo those who say this game is also brilliant. 

This game, loosely based on the Peloponnesian War is a superb blend of politics, negotiation and battle. I especially like the political (influence, assassination, and voting) and negotiation aspects of this game. 

The battle mechanism is also fun and tense: wait till you go into a 5th round of battle, given that 2 rounds is the standard for deciding a conflict! However, keeping straight who's on which side over the full range of battles is not easy. 

The 4-color rulebook is gorgeous, has really nice, clean type, plenty of illustrations, and sufficient examples of game play. Only 7 pages long, and printed in English, German, and French. The map and components are beautiful, too. Some sentences run on too long or lack commas and become confusing, particularly in the part about placing battle units. I found myself writing explanatory notes all over the margins, especially with regard to rules that may have been obvious to the designer but which were left unexplained or were presented in sentence structure that could be termed 'tortured'. That said, it's not all that difficult to figure out (I did find the video available through http://www.bookshelfgames.com/ helpful). 

The negotiation and battle aspects of the game are meant to be played among several people. Again, although it's not that difficult to figure out, this is a game probably best learned from someone who already knows how to play it. Also, it is key to understand that an essential concept of play is that you are a Greek FAMILY trying to influence or control city-states--not a city-state trying to do the same. If you play the game under the latter assumption, because of the way the rules are conceived and organized, you're going to be mighty confused. Otherwise, you might only be marginally confused. 

But personally, learning this game is more than worth the effort, because, although it's heavy in terms of decisions one has to make, it's a challenging mental exercise that is intriguing and rewarding. In that sense it's one of the best Euros with which I'm familiar. After 20 plays, I realize that I'm just beginning to see the various strategies and how deep this game is conceptually, even though it's not that difficult to learn. It really strikes me as a masterpiece of game design. (First played it on Dec. 11, 2007.)

Nice game, neatly designed and packaged; but I'm gradually turning away from area majority games. This combines area majorities with dice-led battles, where a single against-the-odds bad result, or 2, can be game defining given how close the scores were at the end. I think the closeness will mostly happen (as players gang up against perceived leaders), which means the dice may generally be the decisive element, which makes it even less attractive to me for future plays.

A very solid game to say the least, but I think the scoring and the game play overall could have been scaled down to make this appeal to a wider base.

Bel gioco di piazzamento e guerra. Come in altri titoli di Wallace, vale il diabolico binomio regole semplici - strategie complesse. Delle fasi del turno, la pi√π divertente √® quella del piazzamento, con innumerevoli possibilit√† di "sgambetto" all'avversario, dal semplice assassinio all'esclusione della famiglia dominante dal ballottaggio dei candidati-hegemon. Il combattimento √® semplice da risolvere (e un po' culo-driven), difficilissimo da pianificare. Una considerazione: penso che pi√π di altri, questo sia un gioco dove l'esperienza e il numero di partite alle spalle dei giocatori conti ai fini della vittoria. Infine, due cose che mi sono piaciute meno. Primo: ho avvertito poca "stickyness" tra regole e ambientazione... nonostante la mappa della Grecia, i trireme e gli opliti, non mi levo dalla testa la sensazione di aver giocato a un astratto. Secondo: sebbene la qualit√† dei componenti sia ottima (a partire dallo spessore fisico del tabellone), la grafica non √® assolutamente all'altezza del gioco. Ok, i giochi di Wallace sono un po' cos√¨, ma anche l'occhio vuole la sua parte. E poi, cacchio, dalla Fantasy Flight (Twilight Imperium, Arkham Horror, World of Warcraft, ecc.) ti aspetti qualcosa di meglio.

I play with a combat odds table table that lets you resolve battles in a single roll, instead of the interminable dice duels of the original version.

The area control part is super cool and weird.. it is all about negotiation, assassination, and scheming.

I am less and less interested in dice battles.  This game is unfortunately downgraded to a 6.

Very interesting blend of mechanics here.  You'd think that the majority-ish city control would be incongruous with the dice-rolling combat, but they actually fit pretty nicely.  I had a lot of fun playing this, but it's a little difficult to point to one aspect.  Multiple people playing the Persians on the same turn is a bit wonky.

Another clunky, average Wallace title.  Not nearly as much fun as his treefrog economic games (or AoS/Brass);  Lots of playing Chicken (similar to Taj Mahal) with various benefits for winning & some area majority aspects.

RATING: 8
Ok, I'm bumping this up half a notch: This game feels rather unique and is growing on me.

***

Beeing a Wallace design, Perikles is "only" moderatly complex. 

A very good game, almost great, but not my favorite Wallace designs (I rank Brass, Struggle, After the Flood & RRT higher).

Luck: Some luck in the way the city-tiles are availible in the player turnorder + the dice-driven battles (exiting but rather crude).

I rate it an 8 for now - it might go up/down with further plays.

Strange marriage of 2 very distinct game systems, joined by a neat "stock"-manipulation mechanic. The political area-control stage is neat, particularly with the mechanic that winning an election erodes your strength. The war system adds a nice layer of bluff and alliance, though the two-hits only combat has a frustratingly-high variance. I really like how the final value of control in each area is dependent on the outcomes in the war phase.

After 3 plays I think we've gotten the hang on the game. It is more complex than first appears. A nice blend of euro area influence and a part wargame for the conflict. Some people do not like the dice combat resolution. However, the game gives you the option of mitigating the die rolls by stacking the odds in your favour with superior forces. An enjoyable experience. However, when teaching the game to new players, it is imperative to take them through a few mock battles, no one has understood how they work the first time.

RATING: 7
One 5 player trial run. Rules are longer and more confusing than necessary, took a long time to get started. Clearly there will be different strategies to pursue but it will take much more playing to discover them. Combat is perhaps a bit too random and the CRT rules are a definitely 'odd'. Replayability should be very good.

Area control with dice combats. 
Area control means you will spend half the game convincing others that you are not winning, and dice combats mean, even though you may have convinced them, if you roll bad, then you lose. Quite a random way to resolve. The game should go for three rounds but most likely finishes in round 2 due to fall of Sparta
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
An impressive design, one that rivals Struggle of Empires (one of my favorites). Particularly like the blending of mechanics and multiple VP paths. VPs come from placed influence, winning battles, and controlling cities that don't lose battles. 
An area influence phase builds up resources that you use to control cities to help win more VP and to control cities which also gives VPs. However, to do so causes you to give up your influence (VPs). The combat phase allows the city players to position their forces for the battles which will occur
Each component forces you make trade offs, do I lose influence to gain control of a city? Do I burn influence to win a battle? Do I help my opponent win to retain the VP advantage of controlling a city? Do I deliberately lose a battle to devalue an opponents holding? 
A lot of interesting decisions.

Its a majority area control game with a face-down placement mechanic.  Sort of.    Not my usual cup of tea TBH.  Except that the victory points come from a combination of long-term success in the former, and short-term success in the latter.

It is a typical Warfrog game in weight and length, too.  It's not one to try out on Granny at Christmas.

After 1 play, 5p all new:  The game has some good mechanics (new leaders for each city/army each round) and some fiddly ones (combat system odds). I think it is a really good game, but the time it takes for what you get out of it is a little lopsided. I will play this again, but I don't think I'll play it often (even though I had a sleeper win).

Decisions, Decisions, Decisions...   Another very sound game design by MW.  There are multiple strategies to take here, and even if you settle on one, chances are your going to have to abandon it or at least modify it.  This one is heavy on the side of other players actions impacting your outcome (even when they aren't confrontational), but I like that this kinda represents the historical conflict.  Every thing works very well together and the only snag we had was trying to maintain the rules for deploying military units (troublesome alliances )I can't wait to get another play in on this one.

Intriguing ideas, cool theme, although the players being removed from the city states as influential families across Greece (or whatever the conceit is) is way off and almost offensive to any one who gives a tinker's damn about history. 

Lots of interlocking systems, as usual with a Wallace game, and I'm not sure it all makes sense yet...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The theme actually makes sense. The gameplay is one of the best implementations of a multiplayer wargame I've seen. Plenty of interaction and interesting decisions. The combat system cleverly reduces some of the luck of the dice while creating some interesting decisions with regard to what forces to use when attacking or defending. It moves along at a decent pace, plays in a couple of hours and is fun. Once again I have a beef with the Warfrog rules and the mindbending structure and ambiguity of some sentences. Overall I think the game is one of the better Martin Wallace games and I certainly enjoy playing it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The game normally divides itself in three rounds in which there are two large steps.  In the first one, players compete to get the most influence in the different Greek cities to earn the right to control their army and navy.  After all, this phase can be considered a majority game, [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/93]El Grande[/url][/i] style.  In the second part of the round, players struggle at war to win battles.  There are victory points to be won in both phases.  Actually, there are three ways to score.  Martin Wallace has done it again, melting together the best of [i]Eurogames[/i] with the best of [i]Wargames[/i], leading to a deep, simple, balanced, tense and elegant design.

["basic" game only] Wallace does it again.  The game is harshly divided into politics and warfare - the politics is very well done, with ripe choices and good tradeoffs.  The warfare is mostly a dice fest where over 1/3 of the points of the game are subject to a higher degree of luck than I am comfortable with.  Not a bad game by any means, and better than many if not most - but not sure if that special Wallace touch is enough to get me excited about this one.

[ 2/3rds of one play ] We got this started later in the evening, and after a somewhat lengthy rules explanation, got rolling. 

The analysis in this game can be significant, but everyone is thinking a lot, so it doesn't seem annoying at all. There is so much to think about that I wouldn't expect anyone to play optimally in their first game, and I certainly didn't.

Overall I enjoyed it, most of the confusion seemed to dissipate by about halfway through, and I will try it again before I pass any strong judgment pro or con.

We stopped after 2 turns because I had to bail out before 2am. I rate this a 7 for now, but that could easily change.

Most recent play 12-14-07 with Donovan, Corey, and Carter.

RATING: 7.5
One of the 'shorter' and more elegant Wallace games of late. As usual, all the mechanics are tightly intertwined and you would expect to struggle to figure out strategies in your first few games.

Players draft tiles to place influence cubes on locations on boards to gain control of armies used to battle for VP tiles. There's also another subgame where players gain VPs for 'area' control. There's lots to think about as you need to decide which armies to get, how spread out your battles are, etc.

The rules aren't as poorly written as people make it out to be. Download player aids on BGG to help smooth out any rules quirks (hint: Martin Wallace should include quick reference cards with his games!!!).

The game works well without 'special tiles' (IMHO a lazy way for designers to inject flavour and chaos into games). In addition, there's a large chaotic element with the randomness of the VP battle tiles and drafting tiles: not sure if you can plan too much if the tiles don't come up in your favour in the 2nd and 3rd rounds.

I like the theme and the area influence election mechanics, but the CRT is awkward and requires too much dice rolling. Also, there is not much sense of control in this game, at least with five people. I'm beginning to find Martin Wallace's designs overly clunky. More frustration than enjoyment.

Area Control, Conflict. Solid game from Wallace. Nicely combines area control of six cities in the first part of each turn, followed by seven battles, where the leader of each of the cities has the privilege of using that city's military in the battles.

This really is a lovely design.

The mechanics don't work together very well, and the combat is more confusing than it needs to be. The superior force usually wins, and it could be a very simple number comparison, which would still be interesting since the tiles were all face down.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Combat Chart Reinterpretation:
- calculate the attacker : defender ratio and the attacker-defender difference
- if just one column matches exactly, use it (of course!)
- if 2 columns match exactly (e.g., 4:2, 2:4), use the column furthest from the 1:1 column
- if you're between 2 columns, use the one closest to the 1:1 column (note: this includes odds like 4:1 that are off the chart; if you're between 3:1 and the imaginary infinite column, you use 3:1 'cause it's closer to 1:1)

The political half of the game is actually pretty interesting: choices are dictated by the influence tile pool, but you do have a choice of 10 tiles. You have to decide on which cities to go after (high military strength? hoplites or triremes? defend or attack at this turn's battles?), whether to go for cubes or well-timed proposals, how to plan for NEXT turn's elections, etc. If you're weak in a city, you're likely to get weaker (as strong leaders propose you as a candidate): how do you build more influence?

The battle half, however, is not quite as fun. Face-down deployment is kind of interesting, putting some bluffing into the game (even though you know a city's general strength). But the combat table is a nightmare! At least, it was -- I think I understand it now, but it just isn't very straightforward. And even if you do figure out the table, it comes down to a LOT of dice-rolling! There are potentially 21 battles in the game (no rolls for unattacked locations) - we had 17 or so. Most battles have 2 rounds, and each round includes at least 2 rolls per player (usually a lot more than 2). THAT'S A LOT OF FREAKIN' DICE ROLLING! Yes, over the course of the game luck should average out. And yes, there's nothing wrong with having some randomness in battles. But it just got to be a bit tedious running through 7 battles one after another! The battle mechanism is interesting, but it would have been nicer if it had been simplified somehow, and maybe a bit less random.

So, I'm not sure how often this will come out ... it will probably never be chosen by anyone else in the group. But it should play pretty quickly and I'm sure there's some depth to the game, so I might have to force it down everyone's throat on one of my future picks!

The rules are relatively simple for a game with so many interrelated decisions.  The dice can play a significant role here, like Risk, which I also enjoy.  Unlike Risk, you have a decent chance to recover after a slow start and the game has a limited number of rounds.  I would like to try it again and make sure that the complexity of the decisions isn't just a red herring for dice rolls.

Some people find the dice unfair, which they are, but I like it anyway.

The only thing I find unbalanced is the effort we all have to make to achieve something that we could lose with a dice roll. That's not fair and makes the game more poor.

I played a playtest version of this last year at Warfrog's club and found it to be one of Wallace's best designs. Balancing between political influence and military might is tough but rewarding. But the best part for me is the interplay beween players. There's plenty of "If you give me your vote here, I'll vote for you there", type of situations.

UPDATE : Just received my copy and had a quick scan thru the rules. Much more streamlined than when I last saw it and vote-dealing seems to have been done away with (unless I've missed something). Just need to get it to a table now.

Glad to see the ratings on this one finally picking up and heading slowly toward where they should have been from the start.  This game is brilliant!  Who would've thought based on looking at the board, that those two boring looking columns of attacker and defender boxes would be so edge-of-your-seat exciting--it looks dreadful dull, and yet you'll be sweating bullets from the moment those hidden value units start dropping into place. The area control--great...assassination for last second control win--great...Persians for the win---great!

The first impressions leave me thinking, that this is yet another Wallace game that is straight up my alley.
One thing about the game that may either win you over, or make you run away screaming, are the resolving of battles. They involve dice. You may either like or dislike this. You CAN be very unlucky, and lose several battles, in which you were outnumbering your enemey. But you may also win a battle, in which you were outnumbered. In the end, its going to happen now and then, but not very likely to be a dominant factor.
I like it. I find it adding some tension, and gives hope to those that are outnumbered, and is kept at a level where the whole thing isn't turned yahtzee.

Few ways to score points - become o leader of a city, and win battles. When you are a leader you want to defend your cities - more points for this city. You aren`t the leader when you have more cubes - you must have more cubes and be nominated. 

Before a battle you can send a bigger army by sacrafising cubes from cities, but then you have less cubes for the next round and every cube is a point.

The game ends after 2 or 3 rounds, you shoud control this. 

A battle is luck depended (dice), but are emotional. 

Very nice long eurogame with with interesting mechanic.

This game is an interesting blend of politics and battles.  I've heard some complaints about all the dice rolls to determine the outcome of battle, but I thought that was a very fun part of the game.  The politics help determine who will control the strong or weak armies available, and players can come to the aid of their temporary friends against their temporary enemies!

Very strange, cool game. The battle half of the game and the area majority game feed off of each other in important ways, but somehow feel very separate. It's kinds dicey for it's length, but I don't think that's a deal breaker.

Not exactly sure about this one after my first play. It's a study in contrasts. It's only three turns long, yet takes two-plus hours to play. It's not exactly a Euro game, but not a war game, either. Much of the gameplay is very straightforward, but there are a few fiddly elements (such as the city alliances). My biggest early concern is that it could very possibly be one of those games where you do a whole bunch of stuff, but the winner invariably ends up being simply the person who gets picked on least. I wasn't blown away by Perikles, but some of the mechanics are neat (and well integrated, such as the city leadership votes and subsequent battles) and I'm intrigued enough to want to give this more plays to see where my rating settles in.

Only had the single game, so still learning to love it, but was lucky enough to be a playtester many yonks back. It's serviceable, as many Martin Wallace games are, and has some very period features that persuade you that you're not simply playing a well tested system of game mechanics. It's an impressive game, and I suspect that my 8 might be a 9 or even higher after we've explored this one further.

All the parts seemed to work well together (Take turns adding influence in regions, then whoever has the most influence in that region gets control of that regions armies, then you take your armies and fight over victory point chips).

RATING: 8
The dice combat system as prescribed by the rules is completely intolerable; I rate the game assuming you're replacing it with percentile dice or a deterministic system. The major problem is that attacker and defender are simultaneously rolling against two different target numbers, and you have to constantly check whether both rolls together constitute an inconclusive result requiring a reroll.

Anyway, I like this area majority game. You place political influence in cities, but you aren't free to place as you like: You have to choose from available tiles, and are restricted from taking the same type over and over. There can be side-effects to the tiles as well: You might choose one because it allows you to nominate a candidate somewhere, not for where it grants you influence. But since you gain that influence, it might influence your opportunities later.

The "winner" of the city isn't determined simply by largest presence, but has to be nominated as a candidate. Players have limited abilities to make these nominations. It's possible that the strongest player in a city will not get nominated.

The winner of each city controls the hoplites and triremes of the city. (Players who won no cities get to deploy Persian forces!) They get deployed to one of a set of randomly drawn battles. The battle tiles specify a city that is defending in that battle; if someone attacks and wins, that city takes a defeat marker, which permanently reduces the point value of politically winning that city (or having won it in the past).

I think there is a nice balance between feeling like you can do what you want, and seeing the strategic possibilities that the current situation offers.

...If I dock this to 7.5, it would be due to doubts I have about the location tile balance or something. It seemed like Athens was the only city that loses battles. A smaller city can focus on securing the one battle they might have. Even if the player in the lead has a small city, I'm not sure it is worth other players ganging up on him just to win one battle.

...Yes, the military half of the game is really uninteresting no matter how slick you make the resolution rules. The cities' asymmetry is curiously extreme, with Athens and Sparta typically needing to play pure, over-extended defense with no choices and high odds of suffering losses. It makes me think that it's better not to fight (politically) for control of those cities, which is a perfectly valid dynamic I suppose, but counter-intuitive.

The controversial/confused alliance rules (due to post-release Wallace comments) mostly don't even seem to come into play because one's hands are so frequently tied from the need to defend any place you might get attacked.

The most remarkable aspect of the "political" area majority game is how the multiple effects of the tiles you draft, as well as the constraints against focusing on a single city, forge the opportunities that will exist for you in the future. You never feel aimless, or like it's all about leader bashing.

On the other hand you also never feel like you have a million options. I find myself questioning how much control one has, and if it's largely random what you'll be able to do. It certainly does feel tactical (but not displeasingly so) as a political round nears its end and one tries to gauge what could still be accomplished given available tile selection and the turn order.

A little bit fiddly for the first turn until we got the hang of things, and I don't think we made enough of the possibility for alliances (assisting attackers / defenders).  A good, solid Wallace game, full of many difficult well-balanced choices.  Not as high on my list as Age of Steam, but scratches a lot of the same itches as Struggle of Empires in a shorter time.

RATING: 8
The first Wallace I played, and a great one to start with.  One of the rare games that was completely different from what I was expecting but amazingly fun nonetheless.  When I first looked at it, I was expecting a rollicking multiplayer wargame.  When I played it, I got bidding for influence, competing for victory points, and no map-based movement at all.  The only thing that felt like a wargame were the die rolls for battles, and those were only a small amount of the gametime anyway.  Once I figured out that this wasn't a wargame, I enjoyed myself quite thoroughly.  All-in-all, a very good offering, one of the best of Wallace's wargame/euro hybrids a la [gameid=79828] or [gameid=36888].  Somewhat degenerate with only three players.  Make sure you play with four or preferably five.

After first play I can only said that it's excellent game. This game have realy nice mechanic, first when  bidding occurs, and next when fights starts.
I like the idea that people don't attack directly people, but they usually attack cities that give them the most VP. I think it realy works, there is no situation that exist in other games that one player fights with other player until one is destroyed ;)

Of course you can just trying to attack one player but usually it's not worth it.

I realy enjoy my first game.

A excellent lightish game of politics and warfare that i think is nicely balanced in terms of decision making. Players have to balance the clear need to win control of cities with gaining a possible advantage in later turns and with depleting opponents' influence. The rules are fairly easy and the battles pose interesting choices between playing safe for relatively few victory points and risking defeat to acquire more whilst ensuring the value of your statues remains as high as possible by defending the cities involved.

Martin Wallace; Perikles is a game from Martin Wallace. Players assume the role of a noble family seeking to become the leader of one or more of 6 ancient Greek city-states. The game plays out in two phases: In the first, players vie for area control in each of the six states, which end in elections. Players who win the election in each state can then "control" that state's army. In the second phase, players use cards to move their armies to attack or defend one of seven battles (each tied to a state, and you can't attack your own!) that are up for grabs that round. The gameplay mechanic is straightforward, with elements drawn from other Euro-style wargames (especially Martin Wallace's Struggle of Empires). What makes Perikles unique is the smooth integration of the area control/voting phase and the military phase.

This was the first pure Martin Wallace title that I ever owned. It's highly abstract, but everything makes sense contextually and it's fairly easy to wrap your head around it. The most enjoyable idea is having the various military units tied to the game's cities, not to the players. This forces a player to win an election in a city before they can control its military. That feature is essential in making Perikles feel like a game of politics rather than just another wargame. Speaking of which, the war phase is a little wonky and a lot less intuitive than the rest of the game, but once you get used to it, it works well enough to get the job done. The end game scoring is also nice, as it rewards playing the game in a couple of different ways instead of locking everyone into the struggle over Athens and Sparta.

Preliminary rating after just one play. Fun and challenging, but seems "gamey" for gaminess sake kind of like Caylus does - this time from Martin Wallace systems games.

I got this game on Tanga and it took me quite a while to get it to the table.  Both games were only three players, and it seems like it will be much better with more, but even with three it was very interesting and fun!  

The combat system seemed boring when I first read it, but it actually leads to some surprisingly exciting and tense moments.  

By far the coolest part, however, is the political/military trade-offs--do you sacrifice influence to send more soldiers to war? do you invest the influence in Sparta or Athens to try to win some battle tiles, or settle for a couple statues in less-contested cities?  Very cool and I'm looking forward to playing again.

RATING: 8.5
Another great Martin Wallace game.  This one is easier and plays faster than Byzantium yet retains the flavor of the period.  First you vie for influence in cities to control their armies, then you go to fight the battles of the period (abstract fighting) to gain victory points.  Lots of choices on where to place influence, who to support or attack, and how to manage your forces.

I did terrible during my first two plays of this, but I still enjoyed the game. It's a nice mix of calculable, strategic area control and dice-driven combat that adds some excitement to the gameplay. I definitely want to play it some more, there are some really cool mechanisms inside this box. 

/update: The only real downside to Perikles is that sometimes I don't feel enough control over my strategy. The state of the board might suddenly change due to e.g. hidden special powers and there's no way for me to forsee them or defend against them.

I liked it, but I totally sucked at my first play at it.  I spread myself way too thin, and ended up with nothing.

RATING: 6
I actually quite enjoy the election/area control aspect of Perikles.  The fact that having the most influence does not necessarily mean you will get possession of that city is a nice twist.  This process is further complicated by the restriction of not being able to select the same colored tile twice in the same turn, as well as the ability to reduce influence through assassination and the limitation on nomination.  There are plenty of opportunities for scheming and vying for power.

The combat part of the game, however, is where everything come to a crashing halt.  The rules for the order of placing the troops, the allocation of rewards, the constraint on alliance, and the resolution of battles are all unintuitive, not to mention poorly written.  The dice-fest is probably the least of your concerns as you try to muddle through this phase that seem to drag on endlessly.  While I understand the idea behind this design, unfortunately the implementation of it is less than desirable.

In the end, Perikles feels like an incomplete game with some novel concepts.  Not sure if I'd want to play again.

RATING: 7
This is a fascinating game of vying for victory points in three simple ways:
1. Having cubes in the six cities - and those cubes can be stripped out in numerous ways, not the least of which is by...
2. Winning elections in a city, securing you right to a number of victory points that could decrease as low as 0 by game end (round 3 at the latest)
3. Winning battles.

The last can be a painful one:  Although there is a nice scaling mechanism to push the odds in the favor of the right party, based on troop strength, your battles still come down to a few die rolls.  If you effectively implement the strategy "roll well", then you probably can't lose.

I had no idea what to expect out of this, but now that I know what it's all about, it's surprisingly good; however, that may have been biased by the excellent company in which I played it.  There are very interesting mechanisms at work in this game.  If the concept of dice for combat resolution doesn't bother you at all, then this is an excellent game.

It seems very well integrated, so much that it doesn't really allow for distinct strategies; the punishment for neglecting *anything* seem too harsh. 
Nothing memorable about this, and the theme is particularly poorly implemented. Pretty does not thematic make.

Kind of a lot to learn at the start, but helps to think of it like a more economical Castles of Burgundy in a way. The theme is light, but fun and there's definitely some interesting decisions to be made. Would play again!

Abstract:
A tile-laying game by Micheal Kiesling. It requires quite puzzly planning because there is no hidden information. On your turn, you select a spot on the clockwise action board and get resources, monk, or scoring tile(s). You have to pay for the new tiles and place them on your own board which is separated in a dark (generates money) and a bright side (generates points).

Pros:
+ Interesting scoring mechanic (lowest score combined with ratio conversion)
+ Split board (dark and bright side)
+ Randomize clockwise action board: you can pick only the next tile to the right
+ Objectives require conditions to be met
+ Monks add an interesting decision making
+ Works well with all player counts

Neutrals:
# A little bit fiddly due to placement of many tiles each round
# Harsh money swings during the game: rich vs poor (similar to Palasts of Carrara)
# Players have to invest into the dark side to get money early otherwise they will be broke the whole game
# Thresholds can be punishing for beginners

Cons:
- Theme is quite dry and abstract
- Same objective tiles each game (no variability)
- Objectives only useful to get at the end of the game
- Not so easy to get into due to tricky scoring system

Thoughts:
Good euro game with interesting twists on established mechanics like, e. g., selecting tiles in player order instead of who is last in the line (see Glen More). I like the scoring system, although it is not very intuitive on your first games. I also like the puzzle around the monks plus the bright and dark side of the board. The latter feels similar to Palaces of Carrara: first you make sure to collect money (dark side), then you focus on getting victory points (bright side).

Similar to:
* Glen More (similar tile selection, tile placement)
* Palaces of Carrara (feel of gameplay regarding victory managing money and victory points)

Player: 2-4 | Time: 60-90m

Wow!  Very interesting!  The second hardest part is understanding the scoring.  The hardest part is achieving a not-horrible score.  Such an interesting balancing act - just try to keep all the plates spinning.

I do worry about replay value - all the variance is in when the tiles come out/where they go on the main board.  I'm not sure if my strategy would be all that different game-to-game.  But then I've only played this once so we'll just have to see, won't we?

In this game you assume the position of a brewer at an ancient monastery and you are trying to develop your gardens and manage your monks to make the best beer possible. And that's all regarding the theme, as much of the game is quite an abstract eurogame. There is a main game board around which players will move to gather tiles. In the center of the board are the monk tiles, which show you how many rounds are left in the game, and the bonus tiles. After taking the action from the main board, each player develops it's own garden by placing tiles and/or scoring the different resources. The catch is that there are limited number of scoring discs which you can take from the main board, without which you can not harvest the resources to be able to expand later on, so it is a hard decision when to take one.

Heaven and Ale really surprised me.  From the title, to the relatively bland looking board and components, to the description of the relatively modest mechanics, I had my doubts as to whether this game had any distinct virtues for euro gamers.  

On the other hand, when the convoluted end-game scoring mechanic was explained to me, wherein a victory point multiplier and exchange rates to move commodity markers toward each other to make the greatest amount of ale, are determined by where your brewer was on the VP track at the end of the game, well, my euro gamer mind was officially blown.  Whoa, that's weird, and I guess, neat.  Let's see how that plays out!

And boy does this euro play in a quirky and enjoyable way.  This is a game that is mechanically solid and interesting in its game play.  The downstream actions worker placement mechanic, which I do love to  think about and play around with in games like Francis Drake, works quite well here.  The personal hex boards in Heaven and Ale have a very pleasing and interesting shady side-sunny side mechanic, that also works brilliantly.  For those who enjoy looking at their personal hex boards in Castles of Burgundy, the boards here, also produce the same curiously pleasant effect.  What shall I fill in on my hex board now?!  

And I am quite fond of the quirky, and seemingly, suddenly somewhat "in-style" Kiesling mechanic of scoring your board positions when you want to score them, which I will concede, is not going to please traditionally,minded euro gamers.  I think its something fun to play around with, and I am quite fond of its implementation in Palaces of Carrara.

True, the end game scoring in Heaven and Ale is distinctively strange, though in its own way thematic I guess, and that is going to turn off a fair number of players the first time they play Heaven and Ale, particularly when they score perhaps a measly 6 points after spending two hours playing their first game.   

For example, I won my first, four player game with scores of 136 to 32 to 22 to 6, a very skewed result.  The player who scored 6 points was not thrilled.   As such, clearly, distinctively, this euro can be VERY unforgiving for first time players, particularly if they fail to focus on getting regular infusions of money by building early and appropriately on the shady side of their player board.  Yet, some euro gamers who get thrashed on their first game, are actually going to be intrigued by the challenge of not getting thrashed on the second game.

All in all, Heaven and Ale is a quirky, distinctive winner of a game for dedicated euro gamers. It is not necessarily something to play with casual gamers.  I can see this entering the top 100 on BGG based solely on the love of this game by dedicated euro gamers.  Kiesling is on a roll these days; tip of the hat to Kiesling.

Excellent euro.  Played four players and the decisions were very straightforward and easy to understand but agonizing in execution.  Light side or dark side?  Fire off a monk or resource?  Best way to generate money?  Low value shed or higher value?  How to get that slowpoke of a monk up the track?  Very easy to learn and play but definitely not as easy to play well.  I'll update as I get in more plays but so far, so great!

An interesting theme and an scoring mechanism where you are moving multiple resources (for brewing beer) up a track and also moving the brewmaster. You score points for the worst scoring resource and the further your brewmaster goes, the more points you get per step of your lowest resource. Also, you get to exchange resources that are ahead a few steps back and for the worst resource one step forward... that exchange rate is improved based on how far your brewmaster advanced during the game. So, there are some interesting considerations when adding tiles to your board that will eventually score points in a related resource.

I found the tile-placement portion of the game not very interesting. Players are just racing around a track to pick them up and score them on their shaded side of the board for money or on the sunny side for points it's more expensive to place them on the sunny side. All in all, it's just not super interesting. There are monks that can be added to the field too. The most interesting aspect of the game is the part that seems to be showing up in Kiesling games regularly now and that is the in-game scoring which is player initiated. There are 4 scoring markers available per round and each player can score (for money and points) about 12 times per game if they score everything. Skip scoring discs in the early rounds and it may be tough to catch up. It feels wrong to grab those scoring discs early when you aren't getting to much for them, but it's probably worth it.

Heaven & Ale is a good game. It's a quality design from a quality designer. It's also a bit dull in terms of the selection mechanism and tile placement. The most interesting part of the game is scoring, but it's not quite interesting enough to keep me very interested. I'll definitely play it again if I get the chance and I'll play with an open mind, but I'm not as excited about it as I hoped I'd be.

Fantastic game, with lots of options and great replayability. Quite deep, heavy one, however the rules can be tought in 15 minutes. I think the heaviest game from Kiesling so far - sothe cooperation with Schmidt definitely was good, I hope to see more great games from them!
The mechanics of the game are really unique, and make a really interesting, new game

Hint of Egizia/Francis Drake/Lignum. Downstream action selection. Add in some tile laying. Quick to learn, and away you go.
Less tension than Egizia (which is still the best of the genre - except for the broken sphinx cards). This is largely a solitaire tile selection - you're just trying to out-efficient your opponents - hence less tension than the other titles with this core mechanic.

RATING: 7
A really nice medium-heavy weight Euro. The basic mechanism of moving your dude ahead to draft a tile and place it into your tableau is super simple, but the decision on where to place it is tough. Do you place it somewhere where it makes you money, which you need to survive, or points, which you need to win? Which hut do you place it next to? Should I leave a space for a monk next to it so I can hopefully activate it more than once?

I also find myself liking games more and more where there's a clear goal to shoot for vs. the "points for everything" type games where you tally points in a bunch of categories at the end. I still like those games, but the goal here of just moving your barrels (base score) and brewmaster (base score multiplier) up your scoring track is nice.

I'd wager this will be a real winner for Euro strategy gamers, and look forward to trying it out some more.

RATING: 8
Very good game that uses the Tokaido-style mechanism of moving as slowly or quickly as you want around the board to access particular action spots. Players must also be able to balance their resource-engine and money-engine effectively while placing tiles in their monastery fields. Heaven & Ale also has a really interesting scoring mechanism that converts your most abundant resources into others at a certain rate. It's a bit tricky to fully understand so most people will probably not do very good their first game but it definitely made me look forward to my next game.

RATING: 7
Solid game that I'd happily play again. It's got a bit of Egizia/Francis Drake "walk down the road" action selection, a bit of Vikings/Castles of Burgundy tile laying... everything seems a bit familiar. Rounds fly by as each player simply takes an action.

And even though all the mechanics are familiar and smooth, it's not immediately apparent (at least for me!) how to pull together a winning strategy. Balancing money and production. Balancing goods advance with advancing your master brewer. Finding ways to snag those bonus tiles.

I'd like to play this again now that I know how all the gears turn.

I found this to be a unique game that played well with 2. A rondel board where you are collecting resources, monks to activate your resources, in game scoring, or end game scoring opportunities. Depending on what side of the board you play your resource hexes when activated they will either earn you money or advance your resources along the scoring track. This game comes together surprisingly well, explains quickly, and moves at a great pace. I'm really happy I picked this one up as Kiesling has really done well this year with this and Azul. So far this has been my favorite of the Spiel 17 games I have played.

Game is pleasant enough, but it has come out twice at game night and no one is convinced by it.  Too much on a rail, where there are no multiple paths to victory.  Feels very samey very fast. Interesting tension in the last round (which is very tactical) when you don't have enough moves to get everything done, but not enough to justify the game.  Will be selling it

Really nice tension across multiple directions the game pulls you. Looks like a point salad, but it's not. Opportunities for huge point swings based on skillful play. In my games so far, VP ratio between 1st and last place has been up to 10x. It's incredibly humbling (humiliating?) when you go into the last round of the game realizing, "crap, I might end with a score of [i]zero[/i] points!" It's got player boards where you get to place stuff, but placement is not super critical. The central mechanic is a sequence of action spaces, and everyone starts at the beginning of the sequence each round, and on your turn you can go to any space [i]in front of you[/i]. Most of the spaces have tiles to buy (and thus place on your board), which means that you might want to race ahead to get the tile you want, or go slow and have more turns picking up stuff people left behind. Money is very tight. Scoring is very tight. Turns don't drag. Highly recommended.

A neat-and-tricky personal puzzle driven by interactive claiming of tiles and scoring opportunities - and it looks like you have a lot of visibility into what opponents are likely to want once you know the game; for all that your personal board is purely individual, I don't think this'll be remotely MPS. All kinds of spatial and mathematical and timing considerations to juggle at once; nicely brain-burning.

Worker placement puzzle game. Players move their worker 6x around a central gameboard, where they can buy resources (barley, yeast, hops, wood and water) and monks, take activation discs, and score points when having achieved certain objectives as first (4 VP) or second (2 VP).
The resources and the monks are placed on the players' own gameboards, representing a monastery garden where all the ingredients to brew beer are gathered. When they are placed in the shadow they can deliver money, when they are placed in the sun they can help advance the 5 resources along the resource/points track.
They only do so when they are activated, though. This happens when the final hexagon around a place to build a shed in the garden is filled. There are 6 of these spaces on the players' gameboards, in fixed positions. Depending on the sum of the values (1 to 5) of the resources surrounding such a building place, a small or large shed can be built. The size of the shed determines how many of the tiles around the shed can be activated (0 to 4). Is zero useful? Yes, because it can allow a player to score objective points. Another way to activate the tiles is by taking an activation disc from the central gameboard. These can be placed on 10 spaces on the players' own gameboards, allowing them to activate all their tiles representing a particular resource or one of 4 different monks. One of the spaces allows the players to activate all resource tiles of one and the same value.
These activation spaces on the players' gameboards form pairs. When such a pair has been filled, one of 5 cards can be played, granting the player a special action, like moving a resource up the scoring track as many places as the player has resources of a particular kind.
VP are scored during play by achieving certain objectives, and at the end of the game by multiplying the lowest value reached by the players' resources with the value reached by the brewmaster. The latter starts at value 2, and can reach value 6. The resources start at value 0 and can reach value 20.
The game is all about figuring out how much and what to build where, and when to activate what you have built. A puzzle it is !! You really need to find a good balance between building and activating.
Do you feel like brewing beer during game play ? Nope...As in many "eurogames" the theme is just a wallpaper. You could be bringing together whatever 5 resources and 4 types of employees in order to produce whichever product you want to imagine. It's all about the game mechanics, and these are quite satisfactory, especially if you don't like to trust your luck. The game is played without any dice rolls or card draws. You take the decisions. You choose your actions.

An interesting resource engine building game where the resources are finally ones I would care about! Played both games with three players, two of which were new to the game. In the first game, we kept waiting to score resources and monks in an attempt to build larger engines. This just resulted in everyone racing for the scoring discs in the last round and pushing the pace of the game. The second game, I didn't worry too much about having some less than ideal scoring discs since I was able to use them to get bonuses from cards. Those bonuses really helped. I also played the middle of the board in the second game and that was a nice balance of money and good quality. The end game got nasty as I fought with the second place player. In the end, he passed up a barrel scoring spot thinking I was going to use my next move to take his last tile and he'd lose out on 20 points. The mind games can be interesting but it can feel mean when players are taking tiles from you or taking the scoring tiles you worked hard to get. In all, I really liked the game but I think it might be prone to only a handful of strategies and get old quickly. 

[9 Jan 2018] - 7.5 (3 plays)
Revisited the three player count again with a rule correction this time. Prior plays we didn't include enough purple scoring disks at the final round which made a rush along the final round in order to pick up any of them. I do have to say that I did much better this time balancing out bumping the quality of my beer ingredients as well as balancing money. I did get boxed out of the hops market and was really struggling to find ways to bump up their quality by the end of the game. In all dropping to a 7.5 as I felt this play followed some very similar placement strategies as the other two plays. It's also very easy to get blocked out by other players if you're late in picking up a tile or you bet that later rounds will have tiles and they never come out. It's very unforgiving.

It's hard for me to describe why I like Heaven & Ale. It's been a while since I've played a game where I had so little idea of how to play good. But even after scoring a meager two points in a recent game, I want to revisit it's cloister garden. Why is this? I guess, the game rewards repeated plays and reveals a little more of it's secrets with each play. In this regard, it feels a little bit like a hard level in a video game where you know that with a little more practice you'll eventually beat it. Heaven & Ale has aroused my ambition: I want to get better at it, I want to score more points.

Initial impressions after first game (4 players):

The game has that nice classic euro feel. Not a lot of rules, a bit of an odd scoring system, but at the end of the day you look around at everyone's similar boards and ask...Why did I lose by 30 points? A similar question that other great euro's like Castles of Burgundy draw from new players.

The pace of the game is fast, the decisions between money, points, then where to place are solid, and the end game scoring and bonus tiles appear to allow for different strategies.

After my first play I want to play again now seeing where I made some mistakes. For some reason I kept thinking to myself, this is the game Unearth wanted to be (sort of).

Good game, want to play again.

The game about beer brewing where I never feel like I am brewing beer. Mechanics are interesting and, in 3 games, completely non intuitive. Purple disks are too important to skip even if they do nothing. However playing this game is fun and it runs smooth as silk, under an hour.
[b]Update:[/b] Lowered from 7.13 to 6.93 due to limited viable strategies which are pretty counter-intuitive. Purple bonus tokens are absolute priority. Everything else is a filler.

[b]Favorite mechanism:[/b] Building a hut on your cloister when building tile is completely surrounded with hexagonal tiles or monks. When hut tile is determined and placed in the middle some of the hexagons around it are activated.

RATING: 7
I enjoyed this one. It's a downstream worker placement game, but unlike games such as Glen More and other similar games, it doesn't have a 'last place goes' and instead has simpler clockwise turn order. It definitely has shades of Palaces of Carrara. This makes sense since Michael Kiesling has been involved in both games. I say this because the left VP/right Money side of the H&A board is similar to the left VP/right Money side of the scoring buildings. VP sides tends to cost players more money to invest in than the money side in both games. Players also are in control of their own intermediate scoring opportunities. These opportunities are dictated by the tempo of competing players. This tempo is huge in both games. H&A replaces Carrara's market mechanism with the downstream worker placement. There are other differences, but I think anyone who likes Carrara, should also like Heaven and Ale.

While this is a crunchy game, it plays relatively quickly if people aren't too prone to analysis paralysis. I think the weak spot of this game revolves around the barrel tiles. While it's nice to see people jockey for these in the last round, it would be nice if there were some goals that could also be achieved in the early game. How about 24 barrel goals and you only use 12 each game for added variety? Anyway, this is a good game and probably Kiesling's best of 2017 in a very strong year for him. One of the better Essen 2017 titles in general.

RATING: 7
The very epitome of a euros these days in that it’s got a clever mechanism that’s worth revisiting but ultimately is you playing against your own ability to plan well and incidentally against others. 

On your turn you may move to any spot available and pay for the tile(s) / take the action there. Catch is, of course, you may never move backwards, so you have to decide to move way ahead to secure a tile or try and go slow so as to get as much as you can. It's a mechanism seen elsewhere ([thing=66362][/thing] comes to mind), and I liked it for the tension it produced of pushing one's luck. 

Otherwise, you’re playing against your own ability to place your tiles well on your player board so as to build an engine. Placing a tile on the right side of your board costs less and produces money so you can buy more tiles. Placing a tile on the left side of your board costs double but leads to VPs. The monk tiles activate the tiles around them and offer some interesting considerations there. 

All in all, it’s definitely worth a few plays but I’m just not sure how many plays it has in it. That is, I placed my tiles and monks for money early in the game to build a money engine. Seems you’d want to do that every game, but I’ll have to play again to see if it’s less straightforward than it seems after only one play.

Quirky and abstract.  A mix of variations of mechanism seen in many other games such as the action rondel (Glen more, Kraftwagen), area enclosure (Seeland) and lowest score counts (Ingenious).

Only 1 play so far but I finished with 80 points, versus the other players scores of 39,15 and 13.  This highlights how easily the scoring mechanism can go wrong if the resource markers are moved unevenly.  This is not an easy game and I would not recommend for casual gamers.

If Heaven & Ale was a game about whisk(e)y I'd say it feels like a game that has aged quite nicely. None of it feels new, but the action (tile) selection provides enough tension to keep the game going. Even if the divine inspiration seems to have gotten lost somewhere this is a well-rounded offering provided you are at home on the (light or dark) Euro side of the fence.

Mönche, die Bier brauen sind auf jeden Fall schonmal sympathisch. Dem kneipentauglichen Thema zum Trotze ist HEAVEN & ALE aber doch ein rein spielmechanisches Spiel. So ehrlich darf man im friedlichen Klostergarten ruhig sein, wo wir pseudothematisch passend auf Licht (Eurohimmel) und Schatten (Eurohölle) stossen. Auf welche Seite man seine Ressourcenplättchen und Mönche schickt, die man im runden Quasi-Kreuzgang erwerben kann, entscheidet letztlich der eigene Klingelbeutel: Plättchen legen auf die Sonnenseite kostet doppelt, bringt aber auch doppelt Schritte bei den vier unterschiedlichen Bierzutatenmarkern. Und die muss man alle zwingend in den Wertungsbereich bringen ebenso wie den Braumeister. Aktivierte Plättchen auf der Schattenseite bringen Münzen. Finanzkraft kommt aus der Dunkelheit. Die Aktivierungen der Plättchen ist schmerzhaft begrenzt und will mit Bedacht und Timing gewählt sein, weil man natürlich lieber die Art Plättchen werten will, von denen man viele im Klostergarten ausgelegt hat. Wartet man zu lange mit werten, kriegt man gegen Spielende nicht mehr die Kurve. Und das Spielende kommt schnell. Sehr Schnell. HEAVEN & ALE ist ein Sammel- und Legespiel voller Dilemma und Handlungszwänge, das sich sich knackig schnell, taktisch bis gut überlegt und als Frischling mit reichlich Aha-Effekten spielt. Die Lernkurve geht steil nach oben im Spiel, das ist schön. Michi Kiesling, der sich im gesetzten Schlager-Duo mit Wolle Kramer einen soliden Ruf erworben hat, stösst mit HEAVEN & ALE eine interessante Tür in zeitgemässes Eurogame auf. HEAVEN & ALE ist gefühlt jünger als sein Autor obwohl es nach alten Mechanismen greift, durchsetzt mit ein paar frischen Ideen und einem zügigen Zeitmanagement. HEAVEN & ALE ist keiner dieser neuen, strahlenden Überflieger, hat aber alles, was ein Optimier-Bierspiel braucht. Und dafür einen mühseligen Braumeister, den man genauso wie die Schlusswertungspunkte-Bierfässer keinesfalls vernachlässigen sollte. Na dann Prost!

RATING: 8
For me the game is full of interesting decisions - you need money but only ressources give you points in the end; you want this good tile but if you take it there is a chance that another player takes the even better tile. You can trigger a scoring but if you wait a bit you would propably get much more from this scoring. You play a bonus card and have to decide if you really need the money this game or if you can play something which would give you more points in the end. You have a plan but if you make a little sidestep you can get a barrel worth 4 points.
The only thing I'm missing a bit is that you improve your scoring but not your abilities during the game. It could be nice if the bonuscards wouldn't give you a onetime bonus but a permanent ability or if you had any advantage during the game for pushing the brewmaster forwards. (That is not a critique on the game - it is designed very well but only a personal taste.)

Outstanding game. It has simple actions, but the game play is tight and tense (especially with 4 players).  Great midweight, tile-laying Euro.

Components: really goo (cards are really really thick)
Complex: easy to learn, not so easy to master
Weight: medium
Players: preferably 4, plays well with 3
Length: around 60 mins, probably 90
Mechanics: area enclosure, racing for points....
Decisions: where to run, where to put my tiles...
Opinion: a very good euro on the medium side, here we are brewing beer in our monastery, for doing so we have to prepare our ingredients and train our master brewer, also we have to fill our fields with the appropriate tiles and, in the end, the better master brewer will win.
First of all will say that this is an euro, the theme is there, but I could say that you won't feel that brewing beer too much.
The game offers lot of things, but not for a point salad, the scoring is something I like a lot here. On your turn you have to move your pawn to get some tiles, this is a race, you can move ahead as much as you want, cannot move back and will have to think what you want and what others want. Then you have to get fields and monks to place on your fields, and have to decide if you will do on the sunny side (for growing ingredients) or on the shadow side (for money), tough decisions many times.
Some words about the scoring, you will score for your master brewer in the end, but the points will be depending on your lowest ingredient. You have 4 ingredients and have to increase them equally, having one much ahead will not grant you all the points you see. And this is a really nice scoring system.
In a nutshell, a lovely euro with easy rules offering you lot of decisions and choices.

This game rewards repeated plays and can be unforgiving of mistakes. I could easily see someone running out of coins for most of the game or scoring 0 points because they failed to move the brewmaster enough- however, there is a lot to crunch on and once you understand the strategies this game is fantastic, just the right amount of puzziliness and thinkiness !

2018-02-24 - This game almost gave me a Castles of Burgundy feel. It's not as good as that, but I did like it quite a bit. The tile laying is a very interesting puzzle, and I like the tension between want ing to lay tiles so you can activate as many as possible, but also wanting to maximize your brewmaster movement. Looking forward to playing it more.

I’ve really enjoyed Kiesling tile-laying games like Vikings and Sanssouci, so when I saw this had a spatial tile laying element I had to get it. This game packs tough decisions into a fairly short play time, turns are fast and the rondel is quite tense because at any moment someone could take the tile/spot you wanted. The scoring is a bit tough to teach new players, it's quite the learning curve to balance money and scoring resources. The game is unforgiving to new players and you can definitely get blocked for something you really need in the late game if you don't plan right.

Hú, elég érdekes játék. Összességében egyáltalán nem nehéz a szabályrendszere, viszont játszva nem olyan könnyű ráérezni. Konfrontatívabbnak érzem, mint a hasonló jellegű eurókat. Másrészről viszont nagyon mechanikus az egész, tematikát nem szabad benne keresni. A játék végi pontozás elég érdekes, én nem találkoztam még hasonlóval, vagy legalábbis nem emlékszem. Nem állítom, hogy felhőtlenül jó élmény volt, de az kétségtelen, hogy kimondottan érdekes, kell még vele játszani, az biztos, mert elsőre csak azt éreztem, hogy nagyon béna voltam benne. :D

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Enjoyed this one. Different strategies appear to be competitive at first glance. It is an interesting dance between the light and the dark regions as you stay afloat with cash while also trying to drive up your ingredients values on the light side which costs a bit more. The monk activations add in a bit more intrigue and variation as do the scoring barrels and discs. I'm not sure there is anything that new here, but it is an interesting mixture of mechanisms. I do wonder if you will tend to get stuck in a rut in following a similar strategy game after game after game unless you are forced by other players to pursue different strategies.

Ein mangel-Worker-Movement-Spiel, bei dem der MANGEL sehr groß geschrieben ist.
Wir sind Braumeister und versuchen das beste Bier zu brauen, dabei Laufen wir reihum mit unseren Arbeiten und können dabei Plättchen für teuer einkaufen und wenn wir genug davon eingekauft haben, erhalten wir Geld oder Waren dafür zurück. Ziel ist es unsere 6 Warensteinchen aus der 0 Punkte-Skala herauszuholen und dann noch so weit wie möglich zu treiben, dazu noch den Braumeister hochtreiben und das alles mit den Wrsparnissen unserer Jugend.
Ich mag Mangelspiele, aber dieses Spiel treibt es zu weit. Ein Spieler hat seine ganzen Punkte mit Zwischenwertungen gemacht, wie das Bier schmeckt ist ihm egal gewesen. Mit Wasser gesteckt und gut ist. Ich hatte meinen Hof voll gepuzzelt, ein paar Zwischenwertungen mitgenommen und hätte, wenn das Spiel noch eine Runde länger gegangen wäre, noch voll durchgestartet. Aber als das Spiel (meine Waren aus der 0-er Zone) endlich losging, war es leider vorbei..
Bei mir kam keine Freude auf. Thematisch gespielt (Hochwertige Güter eingekauft, etc.) und absolut verloren.

This game oddly give me the same kind of mental challenge as Castles of Burgundy while simultaneously [i]not[/i] feeling like a Stefan Feld game. 

The outside track with the potentially variable number of turns (although in practice most players will take a similar number), combined with the relative scarcity and timing of the activation tokens is a very nice touch.

Interesting game that feels very original. Theme is not really present during gameplay, but mechanisms are a challenge. Keeping the right balance between points and money is not easy. 
I like that you have to decide whether you take a long jump to get what you really want, but then you limit your options afterwards. 
Material looks and feels a bit cheap, while the game was very pricey. 

During first play I felt in constant shortage of money. Only at the end I had money but everyone was running for the most important things on the board.
Really would like to play this again.

Crunchy optimization euro that combines Francis Drake/Egizia 'you can go forwards but not backwards to claim rewards on a track' mechanism, with careful tile placement, combo chaining actions, with wonky scoring that combines a race for goals with requiring you to do well in all different resources.

You can score 10 different categories that each give a combo of money and points, but each can only be scored once per player during the game.

Great game. Solid euro with a lot going on. The scoring system is different and the way that players can trigger their resource tiles in different ways is really neat (activate the tiles, the monks adjacent to them, use a number or complete a circle and build a barn). Figuring this out is satisfying and creates a tense game.

Played full game in Essen. Mechanics are intriguing but game can be quite unforgiving if not perfectly balancing money and increasing ingredient quality. Started out having too little money to increase quality, built up some money but not enough time was left to increase quality enough. Ended up with 0x multiplier and drawed for last place in a 4 player match. 
In the end, game seemed more like a chore with few gratifying moments throughout the rounds.

Didn't actaully want to play this game because of its looks, but when we did it really surprised me in a positive way. The action board and limited possibilities to get income make it an interesting puzzle and planning excercise, but not ground breaking. Somehow the feel of the game reminded me of Fields of Arle. The theme and art could have been better.

Preliminary rating after one play with 3. BGG indicates (at least on 01/11/2017) that 4 is the best number to play this game with, and I agree. If you have 6 rounds, you can first create your money - engine and then start focussing on points. The goals of getting six 1's or 5's seems also reachable within 6 rounds, not within only 4.

So probably a good (even excellent) game, but only with 4.

A very interesting and different feeling Euro game which creates lots on tension in its competition for the best spots on the track. While it can be rather unforgiving of bad play, it conversely rewards clever play. The scoring system will not be to everyone's taste and is certainly a little convoluted but overall I'm pretty confident that it works well. Right now, I'm not sure I'd say I love this game but I do like and enjoy it a great deal.

After 1 play (at Herner Spielewahnsinn 2017)

RATING: 4
In this game players take actions with a pawn on a roundel. On a single turn you can jump your meeple ahead as much as you like, but you can never move counter clockwise, and when you make it back to the start spot you are then done until all the other players are done. This creates an interesting tension between jumping ahead and grabbing an action spot that's more limited or staying back and possibly getting more actions in a round than your opponents. The action spaces allow you to place tiles onto the board if you can afford to do so. Placing tiles on one side of the board allows the tiles to score for more money, and placing tiles on the other side of the board allows the tiles to score for resources. Another action spot type is a once per round scoring opportunity that's only available for the first player to hit the space that round. These tend to come later in the roundel, which means these are the spots often jumped for. If you don't jump at these spots you wind up with fewer chances to score and scoring is the only way you'll get the money to fuel taking more tiles. This mechanism feels more punitive than fun. It's the choice of building your board to hopefully catch up to a player who started earlier or better than you vs jumping ahead and take their opportunity to actually score. It feels like choosing to lose less at the expense of locking in your loss, as opposed to being an interesting choice.

Another element is when you surround the pre-printed spots on your board you get a bonus tile that re-activates a number of tiles around it depending on the sum of the numbers of it's surrounding tiles. There are big rewards for having a very low sum and other rewards for having a very high sum. Lining this up seems to push you into inefficiency as if you don't focus on one area of your board then it takes too long to get the bonus tiles for them to fuel your engine.

There is also an action spot that allows you to pick up as many endgame scoring tiles from the center of the board as you have met the requirements for. This can be a lot of points to be able to grab in a single move which feels too swingy for my liking. 

What you are essentially doing in the game is trying to move up the different colored resource markers on your board up. Each time you produce the matching resource you bump your marker up that many spaces. At the end of the game you score points based on your lowest marker. You also have a "brewmaster" token that bumps up, and depending on his endgame placement, he gives you an exchange rate for your goods letting you spend X of your highest to get a bump on your lowest. The iconography here is not great, but forgivable.

Beautiful game.  Enjoy moving along a common board and having absolute freedom in selecting actions.  The game rule set is not difficult to grasp, but executing a winning strategy as you push your resource tokens and brew master up the production line is far from easy.  There's two games going on, getting yourself in position to actually score points (zero is a possibility) and to score more points than your opponents.  Fun challenge!

An interesting game. There is plenty to consider, and because the unique ways you gain money and resources as well as actually score points, it's a bit tricky to figure out how to do well. I lost by a significant margin in my first game and it's not immediately clear to me how you do better. I'm not always a huge fan of games with that level of opacity between actions and scoring, but it can also just be inexperience. (After all I wasn't able to "read" actions in Agricola like I can now after only one play). 

A nice blend of mechanisms going on here. Theme is pretty weak, but that doesn't bother me much. Essentially though this game just doesn't have anything that really makes it stand out to me. It's solid, enjoyable, and I'll play again from time to time.

Crunchy and innovative game mechanism (two different areas to balance income and points which can only be activated in very limited ways), but also a not fully satisfying end game due to limited activation options and a rather harsh victory condition calculation (pay with successful resources the lower resources in a ratio depending on a third marker)

It's a fine game, for what it is, just not my cuppa. Lots of interlocking mechanisms, with a Francis Drake style track combined with a hexagon player board and a race to certain achievements AND a track where you're making beer (which basically means accumulating a bunch of resources. There's other stuff too. LOTS of interlocking mechanisms. 

Theme? Hardly. The wood and cardboard bits are pretty enough but there is almost nothing thematic about this game besides the pictures of the monks. It's a puzzly Euro. Now, if that's your bag, you may like this. Me, not so much. I want my puzzles with more theme.

I'd still play if that's all there was, if that's what the group wanted. The challenge in trying to maximize points does test the brain. It's not multiplayer solitaire cuz while you're not USUALLY trying to mess with the other players, just by being you you'll take stuff they want. And sometimes you'll deliberately grab some prize before they do. In other words, you can't ignore what they're up to.

It's also a heavyish game to play considering some inadvertent choices from other players can destroy your chances. Still, skill matters quite a lot (which is why I lost). I can just see the line between the top players being a bit arbitrary.

Kiesling gives us another one for 2017! I have had a few plays of Heaven & Ale and my initial impression is that the game is quite good. I have only played it 3 player. But all plays have lasted an hour which makes this a fantastic mid-weight game to throw down at any time. Lots and lots of strategy to unlock here. Reminds me in a weird way of Saint Petersburg is that you build your engine and then optimize use of that engine. Love it.

This is a strange game, hard to describe! Thematically, you’re monks learning to brew ale and improving its quality by improving all the ingredients. But that’s just a story. You are acquiring and placing tiles on your board in order to produce money (used to pay for those tiles) or advance your markers on the quality track. You do this in a sort of rondel track like Kraftwagen or Glen More: a path from start to finish, with stops along the way. Unlike those other games, though, it’s not the person in the rear who goes next. Rather, you simply go clockwise. Eventually, as people reach the end of the path, remaining players will be able to take multiple things. As you place these things on your board, you will surround marked spaces, which is what actually activates your tiles to produce stuff (money or track advancement). There are a few other wrinkles as well: monks activate everything they touch, more expensive tiles allow you to trigger more tiles in your board, you can claim several bonus tiles by meeting the minimum requirements (but only 2 players may claim them), etc. 

Very interesting game with cool spatial play, a tight money economy, and a nice race for scarce VP. The action selection, being able to jump way ahead at the cost of giving every other player a bunch of good stuff, adds a nice amount of tension. Fun!

Very clever design. It's complex in a good way, it makes you feel that you're playing everything wrong and that you'll score zero points in the end but then everything wraps together in a very intense finale.

My rating (8) is based on the first play of the game.  This is one of those games that I was pleasantly surprised playing. I did not have high hopes for it, but did really enjoy it. I found the game to be very clever in it's mechanics, so much so that I have found myself thinking about the game even the day after playing it.  I very much look forward to playing it again.

RATING: 7
First impressions: players move around a sort of Glen More-ish rondel thing collecting tiles for their player boards, perhaps leaping great distances for something particularly desirable. The general idea is that tiles can be placed on the left side of the board, where they will score points when activated, or on the right, where they will generate money. Placement is expensive: even placing for money costs as much as the tile will produce, so clearly it needs to be activated at least twice to be profitable. Placement for points costs [b]double[/b]!

Luckily, it's possible to activate a single tile up to 8 times using unique, once-per-game scorings: score all white tiles, score all tiles of a specific number, score all tiles adjacent to monks of a specific type, etc.

Where things get interesting is the scoring. Resources score in a Knizian "score the lowest of your 5 resources" sort of thing, but with a multipler based on the Brewmaster track. At the start of the game and for a significant portion of the game players will be scoring zero. There are also a large number of (genuinely difficult to achieve) achievement barrels worth 2-4 points.

It's a pleasant surprise to play an optimization euro that remains so opaque after first play. It's clear that different approaches are possible, with the Brewmaster in particular providing scope for cleverness. I'm a little surprised by the notion that the game is too much private planning, because that seems rather difficult (perhaps too difficult) in the face of competition and interference -- there is every chance that an opponent will take the tile or scoring space needed for a plan to come together, or make it a tight race for an achievement. If anything, I'm concerned that the random tile draw has an impact, maybe too much of one, and combined with player interference could make it overly tactical. But still, pleasantly brutal, and keen to play more.

Edit: a few more plays in and I'm not sure how many it's got left in it. Some neat tricks have turned up (such as cheap placement of the 1-cost monk and the importance of 0-7 valued huts), but the system itself no longer feels opaque. It's a highly tactical game of choosing the best (least worst?) option at any given point in time, particularly as opponents are very, very likely to take a required scoring spot. It's important to always have an option for getting money.

I don't think the three player game works properly. This is a four player game (or maybe a two-player brainburner).

tl;dr: very good

Hurray, yet another game about making alcoholic fluids. I don't drink those ever, so the theme doesn't appeal to me. But then again I haven't been bothered by theme a lot. Themes that don't appeal to me usually don't appeal to me because of mechanisms that are usually involved. Like pirates = stealing and stuff, maffia = screwing other players and stuff. Brewing ales? That sounds like gathering resources and converting them to VPs. Works for me if done well.
This game has a number of action spaces. Each player progresses over those in a clockwise direction. If you reach the end of the track, you'll have to wait for the other players to also finish. This leads to interesting choices: do I go slow and pick up a lot of stuff (if there is anything left) or do I jump ahead and grab the best stuff first, picking up less in the end?
Also, there are interesting choices to be made with everything you pick up. Do you place your tiles to advance your markers or to gain money? You need both, but striking a good balance is very tricky! What monks do you take and when do you activate them? How do you place your tiles to have sheds that activate more tiles or let you advance your brew master faster?
As you can tell, lots of choices with everything you do. But it all falls into place quite intuitively and moves at a brisk pace. This leads to a very enjoyable, pretty deep strategy game.
One point on player count though: I have now played this once with 3 and 4. With 4 it felt very natural. With 3 you only play 4 of the 6 rounds. That sounds logical since the amount of spaces on the board remain the same, but the thing is you regularly have to skip over spaces because you don't have the money to do them. That is the same in a 3 and 4 player game. So it feels like there is less time to do stuff with 3, and it feels rushed. This could just be this one play though.

Hmmm. Well, other than lending itself to a clever title, the theme here is paper thin and doesn't have much to do with the mechanics. That's about it for the downsides to Heaven & Ale. The game play is quick and smooth, and despite not being overly complex, there are just a tone of things for players to think about and keep an eye on here. You must keep an eye on what other players are collecting and planning, watch your pool of available funds, decide when you are going to place items for cash or points and, most of all, decide when you are going to activate different types of tiles and monks. And the timing really is critical here. Not a ton of "fun" here, but if you want a thinky gamer's game, this one is definitely worth a try.

Heaven & Ale is a game about brewing beer? I guess, though I never particularly noticed that's what I was doing. I didn't know anything about this game other than it was a Kiesling game. I'm a huge Kramer/Kiesling fan so I was excited to try this.

In the game, you have a player board divided between a sunny side and shady side with hexes surrounding village spots. Each round players take turns moving their pawns around the track to pick up either ingredient tiles, monk tiles or wooden discs. You can only advance forward on this track, but you can move as far as you want.

The ingredient tiles represent different types of brewing ingredients that you put around the village spots (planting I guess?). These can be any of the five ingredients and range in value from 1-5. If you plant these in the shady side of your board, then you pay 1 buck for whatever value the good shows. Later on when you trigger that tile, you'll get that much money. If you plant these in the sunny side, they cost 2 bucks for whatever value the good shows. Later when you trigger that tile, you'll advance the marker for that good that many spaces on the brewing track. (You want to get all your goods as far up that track as possible).

When you completely surround a village space with stuff, that village is placed. The village level is determined by the value of the goods around it. The higher the sum total, the higher the level of the village. Villages range from level 0 to level 4. A zero triggers none of the tiles around it, but moves your brewmaster up the brewing track a lot. Each of the other villages trigger x number of tiles around the village where x equals the village level. Higher level villages don't move the brewmaster as much though. The tiles triggered must be opposites for a level two village, every other tile for a level three village and any four for a level four village.

Monk tiles work a bit differently. They cost 1-4 depending on which spot you pick them up on (later around the track is cheaper) and of course are doubled in cost for the sunny placements. When you trigger a monk tile it activates every tile adjacent to it. If it triggers another monk tile that gives you advancements for your brewmaster.

There's also spots on the board that allow you to claim "barrels". Barrels are scoring opportunities. For example, if you've filled all the shady side of your board, there's a barrel you can claim for that. Or for having 3 villages of the same level. Each of these goals has a large barrel worth 4 points and a small barrel worth 2.

There are special spots on the board for purple wooden discs. When you take one of these discs you place them on one of the 10 spots on your board for them. There's a spot for the five different ingredients, the four monks and one "wild" ingredient. When you place a disc on one of those spots you trigger all of that thing on your player board. So when you trigger water, all your sunny side water tiles advance your water marker on the brewing track and all your shady side water tiles give you money. The wild ingredient spot can be any ingredient you want it to be. The monk spots trigger your monks. Those spots are grouped into pairs. When you cover both spots in a pair, you get to play one of your five bonus cards, which gives you some immediate thing or scoring opportunity.

At the end of the track is the "home" spot that everyone returns to after they're finished taking tiles. The first person in gets their choice of the four bonuses there (start player, 2 coins, 1 brewmaster movement or 2 ingredient movements). Everyone eventually comes home and claims one of these. There's an incentive not to dally though, as when all but one player has claimed a spot, the round ends and the last player must come home. So you might be tempted to go around the track slowly, picking up as many tiles as you can. But then the other players have an incentive to go home and end the round. At the start of each round every space is replenished with the appropriate thing. Any ingredients or monks that didn't get taken in the previous round just double up. You can claim either or both when you go to those spaces.

At the end of the third round, you see how far your brewmaster and ingredients have advanced on the brewing track. Your brewmaster will determine a conversion factor and a scoring multiplier according to how far he's gotten on the brewing track. Then you'll adjust down your best ingredient marker and adjust up your worst based on those conversion factors. So if your brewmaster got to the 4:1 range you'll knock back your best good by 4 and raise your worst by 1. (Obviously the 1:1 range would be much better). You'll keep doing this to bring up your low scores until any further adjustments would lower your best score below your worst. Then you look at the range where your worst ingredient is and multiply it by the score multiplier where your brewmaster is. It is possible (and I know from experience) that your worst ingredient doesn't advance far enough to score any points (zero times any scoring multiplier is nothing!). Don't do that!

I really enjoyed this game. It's quite beautiful. And there's tough choices. Several times I ended up jumping out really far on the track to get particular things I really wanted... leaving juicy spots behind me, but also forcing other players to jump ahead or leave the second half of the track for me to cherrypick. And many times other players took the thing I wanted just before I was about to. The game is fairly straightforward, but how to win isn't obvious.

Besides a very very weak theme, the biggest crippling factor for the game is the poor use of the rondel. While I can appreciate the inability to go backwards, there are so many spots on the rondel that quickly become useless as the game progresses. As such, every round sees fewer and fewer choices as the decisions become more and more obvious.

When it comes down to it, the game does two things quite poorly:
1. It promotes extremely swingy gameplay with it's combo opportunities and the barrel (end-game) scoring; to be able to pick up 10+ points in one move (in a game where a good score is 70) feels way too powerful. Compounding this issue is the fact that the game is scored only at the end, with no point-tracking during the game. Not only is it difficult for someone to adjust a poor strategy during the game, it's also harder to learn and improve since it's not clear why the winner actually won. 

2. Over-reliance on a single mechanic; namely the brewmaster. almost all of the points you score in the game relies heavily on the brewmaster and, as such, almost everyone will be required to advance the brewmaster. This absolutely kills any kind of "non-meta" strategy as the game literally gives you a score ceiling (of 40) if you do not advance your brewmaster. This also impacts replayability as the game quickly becomes a solitaire puzzle on how to optimize for one particular strategy.

Might be the best implementation of the "downstream" drafting system (e.g. Egizia, Francis Drake, Lignum). Having tried all player counts I think 4 is by far the best and what I'll be sticking to moving forward. I was initially concerned about replay value, but it's clear now that different strategic approaches can win. After a handful of plays I still feel like I'm wrapping my head around this game, which is great. The turn angst (with 4) is really good.

Economic action selection on a circular track to plant ale ingredient crops, wood, water and monks on the sunny or shady side of personal hex field boards.  Numerous barrel goals can tempt away from a focused strategy.  Immediate bonus activations around the track create great trade off decisions between needed money now or waiting for a big payoff later.  Crop type and fertility placement around barn locations is a critical longer term consideration .  Money is tight and it’s a challenge to get all the ingredients and the brewer level into the brewing track range.  I disagree with complaints of this game being abstract with pasted on theme—what?  Working for a natural resource company I love and totally dig the sunny and shady side and harvest potential decisions for what will be used for brewing and what gets sold at the market.  I also appreciate the clever final scoring of the brewer’s skill at dumping excess resources to compensate for shortages to then arrive at the final volume of ale produced—love it.  I really enjoy how all the fresh combination of mechanics work together and intertwine with the theme.  Nothing can be neglected.

I love the original idea about tile laying, but I don't think the game provide enough information for players to evaluate their actions and also no flexibility to adjust  their strategy. The game experience is a little bit like "In the year of the Dragon". Some players know what they are doing and gain high VP at the end, but some players totally don't.

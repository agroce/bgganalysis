Rating after 1 game.  Enjoyed this multiple-paths-to-victory game.  It seemed to some extent that your strategy was set by the cards you received on turn 1.  Also it was hard to get an overall view of what you should do - it finally clicked on about turn 6 out of 9.  Having said that, I did win!
We all wanted to play again, but there wasn't enough time.

At a high level, Notre Dame reminds me of Puerto Rico - the same sort of richness of ideas which all mesh together with seemingly lots of options and therefore strategies to pursue. The ideas are different ones to Puerto Rico but they evoked the same feel. The game seems to scale well from two - five and certainly should provide the sort of replayability that satisfies me (10-20 games). beyond that then it may well turn out to be too scripted - just as Puerto Rico can

Placement game with multiple paths to victory.

Appears to scale well, has a relatively fresh card-drafting mechanism (actually very similar to Citadels), and appears to have multiple possibilities/strategies to score victory points and thereby win.  My main issue is that I was expecting a real gamer's game, and with the significant dose of luck via the card-drawing/passing, this can only be regarded as a solid middleweight.

That said, it is an enjoyable game, and a very solid design, and it was nice to see a game finally published with proper sized cards.

130929 I'm not sure if this counts as a WP game.  I almost think I should retry it at least once...but I remember not enjoying it.  And I typically don't with Feld games.  But this was an early one and I do like In the Year of the Dragon.  But if I remember correctly there were several issues with this game that I disliked.  Maybe something having to do with counting the deck?

100703 Meh...I think I'm just not a big fan of worker placement games.  Not bad, but not particularly memorable either.  Will play again if proposed, but certainly won't ask for it.  I think Agricola pretty much scratches that itch...and if I was to get a second one, I'd get PR.

I first played this at BGG.con '06 thanks to Val Putman, and have tried it a few more times after it was finally released. This one is a keeper... Alea does it again! I love how it scales so well, how there are so many strategies... every time I play this I see someone win using a new method. I think it has a bit of a learning curve, but nothing out of line with other Alea games. One of the best of 2007!

Wow.  Could this be more amazing?  The way the board fits together to form the city and roads is brilliant.  Excellent art and graphics.  Just beautiful overall.  When the board is put together it looks like stained glass.

Then you play the game and it's just as beautiful.  I couldn't believe how much fun I had playing the game, even though I was beaten badly.  Lots of meaningful, tough choices to make.  Very fun to play.

Played 2 games and went into it not expecting to like it that much, from reading various comments and feeling tired of many of the standard euro mechanics. However, a very pleasant surprise and very engaging. Different strategies to follow and the playing time is just right. Only criticism is that a generous or unthinking player on your right can give you the win. Will certainly get this one in Essen in the autumn. if everyone is playing a careful game. Overall, this puts Alea back on the map for me.

Played a few times now. Somehow, it doesn't hook me very much. Very little interaction with other players beyond passing cards, so that makes it a bit unexciting somehow.

This is a good game and one I'd play most often that it was suggested.  On the positive side, there's  a lot of good decision making to be done, it's quick and maintains your interest throughout.  In middling terms, the theme whilst a bit abstract is just about there and is certainly better than some abstractish Euros I've played.  On the negative-side a fellow gamer remarked that it hadn't got much player interaction, and I agree with that.  I like that in a game a lot, but if another doesn't then he might well be looking at scoring this as an 8 or 9 here.  There is the card passing and the ability to use the coach to nab chits before other players can, so there is at least some inter-action.

Funwise I'd give this 7 out of 10 and so I think that's where I'm going to place it.

RATING: 6
*Rating based on one play.

I first played this in 2013, and it is a game that shows its age.  It does not have the same feeling of depth and intricacy of recent Feld designs like Bora Bora and Castles of Burgundy.  The card drafting mechanic in this game is uninteresting and problematic.  It is problematic because you are always passing your cards to the same player, as opposed to a game like 7 Wonders where you switch directions in passing cards.  This puts players sitting next to inexperienced players at an advantage.  Additionally, the small hand size and limited usefulness of the cards make the drafting decisions quite simple and easy.

On top of that, the rat mechanic that is a rather large part of the game feels like it is not well balanced.  Granted I have only played once, but in that game, I was able to ignore my rat population for most of the game and I won handily.  I only bothered to deal with the rats when it was easy to do so; otherwise, I simply let the rats pile up and took the penalty, which does not seem steep enough to warrant the investment it takes to keep rat populations down.

All in all, my experience with Notre Dame was a disappointing one.  It's not a bad game by any stretch, it is just nowhere near the top of my favorite Feld list.

The first Stefan Feld I ever played (before I started tracking my plays). I think it is a great game. Unique right down to the shape of the board. It is one of Feld's "punish you" for making poor choices or being unlucky games. I still think there should be a variant that lets you load up the plague carts with corpses and dump them in opponent districts to up their plague rating...

RATING: 5
I don't really get the appeal for some with this game, to me the different actions are rather bland which isn't necessarily a bad thing but at most only half of your cards are really going to suit your strategy so if you draw one good card in every set of three then you are laughing but if you draw them all at once you are screwed because a smart opponent will not give you a card that is perfect for you, but then again their hand may be forced as well due to the card draw, it loses its appeal for me based on that.

Players need to balance everything in order to win the game. Money, victory points, influence markers, movement of car, visiting the Notre Dame and killing rats. Too much rat = plague. 3 sets of 3 rounds.

A very smart board game design. It's beautiful, colourful. The designer has make the board interchangable between 2-5 players. It's colourful, smart, engaging and a great game to play.

Yeah, this is my kind of game.  I knew after reading the rules (well, not the first time, but certainly the second time).  I confirmed it after one play (I lost).  The game is close, fun, many paths to victory, and rules don't change throughout the game.

Update: All 5 of us played really differently, and the game still ended up so close.  If that isn't great game design, I don't know what is!

+ Good blend of card drafting and long-term planning; Plays wonderfully with anywhere from 2 to 5 players.
- The artwork is pretty bland; Player district boards are a little thin.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Abstract:
A card-driven euro game by Stefan Feld. Each player has a deck of cards and a district board that is connected with the other players' board. All players draw cards, then activate them to put influence cubes on their districts and activate the particular action (the more influence cubes, the more powerful). Each player also has a carriage which can be move to collect bonus tiles.

Round overview:
a) reveal new person cards (can be bribed for special abilities)
b) choose action cards (draw three, keep one, pass over remaining cards to next player)
c) play action cards (activate action of a province by placing influence cube)
d) bribe one person (get one-time ability for one coin)
e) determine plague value (subtract modifiers, adjust rat tracks)

Pros:
+ Indirect player interaction by card drafting, majority in cathedral, and collecting embassy tiles with carriage
+ Person cards add dynamic: move influence cubes, get boni for different conditions 
+ Tricky influence management: improve efficiency by placement and shifting cubes
+ Carriage movement: get tiles before the other players
+ Feels balanced in all aspects
+ Different ways to play
+ Plays well with all player counts (2-player has a different taste because one of the two drafted cards comes back)
+ Quick play-time for such kind of game
+ Nearly family-friendly (gateway plus game)
+ Easy to learn (9 action cards and 3 Persons, after the third round, everyone knows most of the game)
+ Quick turns, smooth game flow

Neutrals:
# Disease/rat management: push your luck and optimization, however, some people do not like being punished directly
# Theme is okay
# Some randomness and luck: drawn cards for actions and persons, number of rats
# A small memory element: which cards have been played
# Nearly no hidden information (except for cards drawn for drafting)
# No take-that elements
# Geometry of the player boards is unique
# Rather tactical than strategical
# Might be a bit too light for some gamers
# Sometimes a revealed person card may favor only one particular player (especially the cards from the expansion), however, all persons in play should be published at set-up time so that players have the chance to adjust their strategy
# Scoring happens during the round, between rounds, and at the end of the game

Cons:
- Component quality is okay but very thin tokens and player boards
- Component quality has not been improved in the 10th Anniversary edition (at least: it already includes the must-have expansion "The New Persons" which increases variability and replayability)
- Iconography is good for the most part but not always intuitive
- No player aids

Thoughts:
Notre Dame has just the right amount of complexity and options to appeal to a lot of people. I like its elegance most. Everything in Notre Dame feels balanced: card drafting, bribing persons, moving the carriage, and distributing influence cubes to improve actions. It is a lighter game by Stefan Feld and some folks might wish for more complexity.

Similar to:
* 7 Wonders (a more complex card drafting game with a lot of different cards for set collection and engine building, but has no central board or carriage movement)

My wife thinks this is a little dull and "the same" -- and I agree, really.  Still, I found it quick to pick up and really like some of the mechanisms, so I like it a bit better.  I will enjoy playing this from time to time, though it does lack a certain pizazz.  The influence choice + action mechanism + drafting just tickles my sweet spot enough to raise it a bit above some other good games that aren't favorites.

HRM.  Ok, after five more plays, this is just too annoyingly scripted, 2p at least.  And, to the extent it isn't as scripted as it seems (yes, you can safely pass a cathedral card sometimes, maybe), it's still just a little... dull?

RATING: 8
An interesting cube placing game where players use the benefits from their areas of Paris to accumalate points. Each area has different benefits such as scoring points, earning money or keeping the rat population down. Running out of money or allowing the rats to start reducing your population and VPs is not a good idea. Very enjoyable game with a number of ways to win.

Very elegant game! Laid-back and easy-going, very enjoyable. Great as a 2-player game! I love the instructional icons on everything - cards, buildings, etc - no need to constantly refer to rulebook. 2015 UPDATE: After reading over reviews and because of my decluttering kick, this one is now in the maybe pile for trading - TBD. The problem I have with it is that it seems dated in terms of artwork and game play - just another cube pushing, resource building, VP gathering game. I've since decided to reduce the numbers of these types of game for more thematic one. As such, Keythedral is one of my choice games in the old school dry-and-dull Euro category and, given my limited opportunities to play, I will likely always pick that one first. I want to focus my game collection on easier to pick-up-and-play games with minimal rules reading. Apparently, if you are familiar with the higher VP scoring cards that show up in late game, you have a leg up on your opponents as you build up your engine in the early game. This is not a good mechanic for something I might play once or twice a year.

Plays really well with two and, really, has become one of my favorite games. It plays really quickly, without really any AP and, with only nine action cards (and then the various people cards) it's really quick to learn the cards. The strategies seem pretty straight-forward, but I'm really enjoying exploring this one.

I get the criticisms against Feld, but I've become an unabashed fan of his designs.

A finely tooled, soulless machine of a game. Yet another exercise in maximising efficiency and grinding out the win. Comes within a hair's breadth of multi-player solitaire.  I like card drafting as a mechanism, but as implemented here it lacks interest.  It is usually too obvious which cards are best for you and too good for your left-hand neighbour.  Stronger theming would have helped; this really does feel like nothing more than pushing cubes and collecting victory points.

I didn't see what the fuss was about at all when I played this face-to-face. After a few more games (unlogged on BGG) at BSW, I begin to see the appeal, but there's not really enough in this, for me, to justify its length as a FTF game.

May 09: Returning to this as a 2p FTF, I enjoyed it very much and have increased my rating. As an occasional, quick game it has the potential to be deeper than I'd thought, with tough and exciting decisions.

Probably wouldn't ask for it, but wouldn't turn down a second game either. I ignored my buggy, and it cost me. Not much player interaction. The only person who I could affect was to my left (I could pass crap cards to her; she just happened to be the game leader/winner/owner!). Otherwise, I can't see how you can slow another player down much, without collaborating with other players. My $0.02: a very random version of Goa; not entirely a slam, as I am very fond of Goa...

Stefan Feld adapts card drafting into a an action selection game that allows for quite a bit of strategy with minimal components. The art is well done and the game play is easy to work your way through once you have a game or two under your belt. It scales well for 2-5 thanks to a modular game board that shrinks or grows with the number of players. While as essentially theme-less as many of his games it is still a strategic game with ease of play and very good quality components. A hidden gem of this genius game designer.

I could understand how this might contribute to Euro fatigue.  Little drafting, little placement, little movement, little strife.  Lots of elements which don't quite add up to an engrossing experience for me, and it seems like it could use some kind of sense of personal ownership to draw in the player.  Perfectly fine as a game for my tastes, though, and another reason that I should grudgingly get comfortable with online play at BSW.

I've played this as a two, three, and four player game so far.  The rules are kind of a maze to get through, but once you know what you're doing, it's very straightforward and moves quickly.  It's not all that complicated once you know what everything does.  There's not really anything you can do that will affect anyone else, other than passing a few cards.  It's still very hard to mess someone up, and thus most of the game comes down to luck and what you do with the cards you've been dealt.

It's nice to have a game that I can still enjoy when I'm doing badly.

It's strange how my opinion of this game changes each time I play this. On my initial play at Geekway, I was slightly bored and generally unimpressed. I kept thinking about the game, though, so added it to my post-Geekway game order. Since then, I've had an okay game, a pretty good one, and a very dry and boring one. I think it might be because there's only one form of player interaction in Notre Dame, the card drafting, and that's just the aspect of the game I'm least fond of.

Update: I traded this away. It just didn't thrill me enough to kee playing it.

This is a solid game, but tends to feel a bit solitaire in play.  Player interaction is limited to the carts moving around the regions and the card drafts.

RATING: 7
Even today (2015), Notre Dame stands on its own. Overall, this is one of the lighter Feld games, but it has a healthy amount of tactical and strategic decisions. Furthermore, money/resources are tight in this game and the plague threat always present; as a result, the game has a healthy amount of tension. 

If I had to criticize the game, beyond the thin cardboard chits, I would say that luck-of-the-draw is quite influential; The card-drafting mechanic eliminates some of that... but players tend to focus their actions in certain areas and having certain cards come up, with certain round cards, can be significantly helpful or harmful. But still, the game plays quickly and is quite engaging. Highly recommend for most euro gamers.

My first impression is positive. The game is really a tight resource management exercise, but a great one, full of those excellent agonizing decisions I love in the greatest games. The rating is likely to go up with more plays.

UPDATE: My favorite moments in gaming all involve having to take an agonizing decision amongst just a few options. If the number of options increase too much, it becomes a calculation exercise; but with just a few options, the decision must be tense to be interesting. How can I go wrong with a game composed only of such decisions? Each decision is meaningful; yet it's not necessary to become a human computer to calculate the outcome. Up to a 10.

Very clever board designed to accommodate different number of players.  Need to watch the rats.  Very little interaction apart from passing cards to your left neighbour, so you need to adopt a different strategy from them as you are unlikely to get passed the cards they require.  Largely you are playing the game.  Similar to Through the Ages in that respect, but mercifully shorter.

Bought this game on a whim (half price at Play). What a bargain! Got it a short time after Pillars and thought they might be too similar but I was wrong. Which is better - probably Notre Dame in the long term, however I would suggest that you should have both if you enjoy one of these. The board design is very very specially cooly neat. Scales fantastically well. Super theme and lots of ways to lose without the ball of vile that some games can produce.

RATING: 10
While there's been a glut of worker placement designs in 2006-2007, I think Notre Dame does it best with the added novelty of the card drafting mechanic and a manageable play time. It's a very clever game design with multiple resources: workers, money, VPs and rats (the anti-resource) and multiple strategic paths. Perfect balance of tactical and strategic choices as one struggles between specializing for greater net gain and diversifying out of necessity. The card drafting and the rotation through the personality cards adds a nice level of randomness which should keep things fresh. Definitely a must-own game.

Nagy volt a várakozásom, ennek ellenére nem csalódtam a játékban! A sok lehetséges választás ellenére pörgős, szemléletes grafikája miatt könnyen átlátható, és nüanszok döntenek a végén. Teljesen nyelvfüggetlen, a kártyák biztosítják a kellő változatosságot. A különböző játékosszámok megoldása is eredeti. Minden adott egy könnyed, de azért nem túl könnyű Eurogame-hez. Kifejezetten tetszett! Bármikor újra játszanám kategória!
A kártya elosztásához hasonló mechanizmus azóta több játékban is visszaköszönt (Agricola haladó változat, 7 wonders).

A 2. partinkban meglepően nagy különbségek adódtak, szerintem van egy elég hatékony stratégia (rámenni az 1-2-3-... -as mezőkre), majd legközelebb is kipróbálom, ha akkor is nyer, akkor rontok a pontszámon.

After just the first play with 3 players: interesting game where the cards you get and the choices you make per turn are those that will make you different from the other players. I think that after 2-3 plays you will know what to do to win, it'll just be the cards that will be drawn from the decks and the hands passed along to others that might get in the way of success. I will try playing more..

Played this game quite a bit.  At first, I was luke warm with the game but it certainly has grown on me.  The game is pretty simple with rules.  The cards certainly make your decisions very hard.  There is a steep mastering curve for this game.  That is why I like the game quite a bit.  Easy to learn, hard to master.  With the plethora of card combinations with what you get and what others pass to you, the game is never the same twice.  The game really ratchets up the tension as you try to keep the rat level down while scoring a lot of points.  Overall, a very good game and now I have made components to make a 6 player variant.
Rating: 8

Update: Dec. 22, 2007
I really like this game.  The game can actually be taught in about 5 minutes but it takes quite a bit of time to master.  I like the drafting mechanism as it offers a lot of delicious decisions.  One thing I want to try though is to alternate passing direction.  This way I can affect people in both sides.    Even with the random cards that you get, the game still gives you a lot of control.  I like it because it gives a lot of replayability and with that the game is still very balanced.

Notre Dame is a classic Euro, but it has its own shenanigans and feels quite unique. Basically there's various areas of "expertise" a player can build to gain incremental advantages. The chance to build one or another is influenced by the cards drafted in various three-card mini-drafts at the beginning of each of the nine rounds: so the game is more about tactics than strategy. Probably the sweet spot for the game is with three players, but four could be enjoyable as well.
The main strength of the game lies in its pace: it is fast (can be played in under an hour) but gives many chances to make decisions. Definitely a good game!

Out of Print (OOP).

Finally got our first game going today. For a start it did take a while to explain the cards (both the standard deck of 9 cards each players received and the characters deck).

However, once the explanation was over, each round went past really fast. We got the hang of it and understood the mechanics of the game quickly and it was fun balancing what needs to be done and the need to keep the rat population under control. Going to get more plays out of this for sure!

RATING: 6
generic eurogame. lots of resources to fight for, too little actions to aquire them, lots of paths to victory, enough randomness to make responding to situation on hand at least as important as the overall strategy.  I can play this anytime, but it's not a game I would really like to play more than 10 times... also, it is terribly dry, and this is the only game that gets this complaint from me.

all in all, this is a little disappointing when you consider it is a 2007 game. you'd hope the eurogames have moved forward a little, and this is such a depressingly generic euro.

I was interested in playing this game to compare it to Feld's In the Year of the Dragon.  Notre Dame wasn't even close to achieving the same level of gameplay as Dragon, but I did enjoy my first experience with 4 players.

Notre Dame was pretty random in regards to the people up for bribes and available actions for each round.  I disliked how I had to reference the rules to understand the benefits of bribing each and every person (but this is only a minor complaint.)  I liked the card passing mechanic, but I can also see how a player can get really hosed by getting 3 of the best cards and then having to pass 2 of them to opponents.

RATING: 8
6/17/07 - About 40 games on BSW and a few face-to-face.  This is quickly becoming my favourite Alea game out there as I am constantly looking forward to my next game.   This game is mostly a solitaire struggle between players, though through pasing cards and stealing messages you can affect how the other players play, especially the player to your left.   You need to balance you resource and gold production while limiting the effects of the plague to earn Prestige Points along the way.  Lots to know, but once you play it is quite easy to grasp.

Lots of familiar Feld elements such as lots of different ways to score points, something that beats you down if you dont do something about it but not so much you  cannot ignore a bit, mish mash of mechanisms with fresh elements and a good mix of tactical and strategy..  This was an early game to use the sushi go/ 7 wonders style of drafting and it uses it with action selection and a really interesting cube management mechanism where the more you play an action the more powerful that action is.... as long as you have the action cubes to scale up actions.  Accessible in rules but there is a real feeling of "is this working" whereas with other Feld games you can be much more "I can do x for 5 points or y for 6".  The base game could do with a bit more variety baked in as it is the same cards that come out all the time.  This is "fixed" to a point if you have the 10th anniversary edition but my own problem is that you then need to remember which cards are in the mix, an extra set of cards so you know which ones are being used would help to take the memory element out of the game.

Very enjoyable game from first plays, looks like lots of balanced strategies are possible which can only be a good thing.

First Play: Rules are relatively straightforward although we did need to keep refering to the sheet to explain what the character cards did.

An OK-ish sort of game that is heavily driven by the turn of the cards. Get your three prime cards in the first hand and you will be in trouble while your neighbour can't believe you have given him such great cards. This aspect was too random for me. Not a game I'd seek to play again and certainly not one that I'd buy even at it's current knock down price of £7.99.

Alkuinnostuksen jälkeen jäänyt hieman vähemmälle pelailu, lähinnä ehkä uusien pelien myötä, sillä hyvät fiilarit kyllä ainakin itselläni on. Tunnin peliksi aika monipuolinen, on paljon eri systeemeitä, joista pitää huolehtia. Tuuria on tietysti aika paljon mukana, joten pelissä on melko paljon tilanteisiin mukautumista, eli tehdään vain se mitä sattuu pystymään. Toisaalta on olemassa erilaisia taktiikoita, joita voi yrittää toteuttaa, joten pohdittavaakin riittää. Hyvä kokonaisuus siis. (17.3.2009)

Noni. Tätä on sitte paiskittu lähinnä BSW:n suosiollisella avustuksella paljon. Onhan peli aikalailla erilainen, kun sitä jo ymmärtää melko hyvin. Ei todellakaan läisintää, ja "tuurinkin" vaikutus hieman muuttuu, tai siis tuuriansa voi niin sanotusti ohjailla. Taitoa, pelin lukua, taktikointia ja tilanteisiin reagoimista tarvitaan, jotta saa hyvät pisteet. Huippupisteet vaativat sitten jo vähän tuuriakin, tai ainakin kavereiden suosiollista avustusta.

[url=http://ballearicus.blogspot.com/2012/01/notre-dame.html]Notre Dame[/url] es un juego de apariencia engañosa. Es necesario tener un cariño especial a los euros y haber jugado a muchos diferentes para ver mas allá de un mueve cubos sin alma. En un juego que cumple a raja tabla los cánones del eurogame al uso, jugarlo y ser capaz de saborear sus pequeñas sutilezas es gratificante. Es en ese momento cuando descubres que estás ante un juego muy bien diseñado y equilibrado, del encaje de bolillos de sus mecánicas. De duración ajustada y un factor azaroso bajo, lo hace apto solo para jugadores que gusten de saborear de la pureza en los euros. 

Si has estado evitando Notre Dame pensando que "sólo es otro eurogame" te recomiendo cuanto menos darle una oportunidad. Sorprende gratamente.

Si te gustan los eurogames debes considerar seriamente la opción de Notre Dame.

RATING: 8
A very enjoyable non-contested-area-influence game with a great deal of risk management and crisis mangaement. The game takes a little while to explain but it is very deep game. Due to the fact that the area influence is non-contested there is very little player interaction except the initial card drafting before each turn.

I expect this game to hit the table time and time again.

Fun, balanced, interesting theme. It's a middle weight Euro but it hasn't really had the super longevity some games have had with our group - its tactical, rather than strategic, given you're somewhat at the mercy of what cards other players give you. It's possible to be railroaded into a particular approach where you don't really have much choice in a given turn. This is rare, though, and it's generally a tight race until the end. There are many similar great games, though, so I'm not sure this is unique and challenging enough to really stand out.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.6
Very nice game with lot's of options and strategies possible. Your actual choices will however be limited according to whatever cards you get by the very nicely incorporated drafting system. This speeds up the game which would otherwise be another maximising your actions game. Lack of player interaction is a big downside of the game. The playing board is a work of genius. And whatever you do, beware of the rats!

This is a very good game and an excellent "transition" game toward medium/heavier Euros.  There are multiple paths to victory.  With drafting, there are things out of the player's control, but good adjustments should save you.  My first two games were good, but I wasn't totally clear on what I was doing and I'm sure it wasn't a coincidence that the player to my left won in both of those games.  In the next three plays, I felt like I was making moves that helped me every turn (and making moves to not help my opponents).

My favorite Hand Management game.  Notre Dame is just a cool game with very cool mechanics.  It is medium light and imho a gateway game.  The game has multiple strategies and you are left at the end of each game wondering what strategy you should do in the next game.

RATING: 8
It uses card drafting to force the players to make tough choices and then lets you only take two of the three actions you have cards for. 

I suspect it will be one of those that will be played a lot for a while and will then be relegated to the shelf for a year or two at a time before being played a few times and then sent back to the shelf.

Low scoring game for a "Feld".  Interesting take on the card drafting mechanism.  Game length is just about right for a "Feld", and offers interesting choices throughout.  The components leave ALOT to be desired (super thin, very ugly graphic design, and horrible artwork on the cards).  Very interested in more plays (including the expansion!).

RATING: 8.75
I really enjoy this game--way more than I expected to--and I continue to enjoy it, even after playing it many times within the course of just a few weeks. The gameplay is quick, so there's no sitting around and waiting. The only part that can induce some AP is the choosing of cards, but you only have three to choose from, followed by two to choose from, so even for a slow player, it won't take more than a minute. I've played with 2, 3, 4, and 5 players, and it works well with all, though more than 2 is better because I find it more intriguing to have no clue what third card will be passed to you (with 2 players, you get back one of the cards you just passed). I wasn't that crazy about 5, either, but that just might be because a couple of people were new to the game and took a long time to do anything (you can totally decide what you're going to do on your turn while everyone else is going, but they weren't doing that). Also, I had just played Caylus for the first time and might not have been as into the game as I could have been. :-) There are many different paths to getting VPs (the winner of my first game had tons of money and kept going to Notre Dame and also got many of the secret tokens; someone else had tons of cubes and filled up many spots; I had no money and very few cubes, but I had two cubes in the park and kept invoking the VP space to gradually build up points--I tied with the second player). It feels like a lighter game, but has many satisfying decisions to make, and it's a lot of fun. Because the card shuffle and other players' choices on what cards to pass you are different every time, you can't always employ the same strategy, which increases the playability--every game is different. The fact that it's short helps, too. If I don't have time for a long game but want something more than a mindless filler, this is perfect.

Played well with two.  

This game has grown on me as I have become a Feld fanboy.  It's quick, lots of tough decisions and numerous ways to go about getting points (one person in the group feels there is ONLY one way to win).  Shrug.  I don't think so.  That person won the last game because no one went into Notre Dame in the second round, giving him 10 uncontested points.  

I have bumped this up to an 8.  I think 3 person games of this are the best.

July 2017 - Still a very solid 8.  Best with 3.  I like the changes with the 10th Ann. copy.

RATING: 5
I can't tell you which is more disappointing, Augsburg or Notre Dame.  The former had some ingenuity but obviously could have used some more development.  Notre Dame hangs together far better but it is such a depressing retread of past German games.  The card drafting system obviously borrows from Fairy Tale, yet none of the subtlety persists because Notre Dame mostly abrogates the need to keep certain cards from you opponents.  I find it disturbing the recent trend of 
limited player interaction games and Notre Dame is just another addition to this bloated category.  My favorite games almost all hinge upon varied and copious player interaction; mostly because such things create longevity in a game. 
 
Combine this defect with a deficient theme and an uninspired optimization game revolving around cube exchange and you get something thats banality severely detracts from its many good qualities.  I think my complaint is best summed up by a conversation with my sister who notoriously hates boardgames, yet mysteriously liked Notre Dame.  She said it was "easy" and when asked to elucidate she stated that she could focus on her game and didn't have to worry about other players impinging on her plans.  To my gaming sensibilities that sounds less like a game and more like an activity. 
 
I have to wonder if this recent downturn in quality from Alea results from a poor choice of designers.  The Golden Age of Alea games is replete with names like Tueber, Knizia, Kramer, Dorn and heck I will put Seyfarth in there too.  Almost all the mediocre entries in the line have unreliable names attached.  Frankly, I don't know how Stefan Feld has done 3 of the latest 4 Alea games when his portfolio suggests a lack of the needed spark to design a great game.

Played one time using a proto-type of the game. Special thanks to BGG'er Valerie Putnam for her excellent explanation of the rules, which are all in German. Players compete for points by collecting messages and investing in certain institutions/buildings. All the while, players must control the rat population in their quarter of the city lest they flourish and eat away their investitures (sic?). This is done with decks of action cards, which players draw from and pass draws along to others to give them their range of actions for a turn. Players also bribe officials to allow themselves special actions to earn points and assist in controlling the rats. A careful balance must be maintained in collecting points and the thankless task of controlling the rats. If you are too zealous in one activity or the other, it will probably cost you the game.

Fairly steep learning curve.  Each facet of the game is run by a different engine that is linked to the other engines.  Lots of luck based on the cards you get... and you definitely need to pay attention to which cards are left in your stack and your neighbor's stack.  Seems important to get cubes in your hospital early.  Feels like having a few more resources (ex. more starting cubes and money) would reduce the amount of luck of the cards.

Another highly regarded game I don't like! Very abstract with virtually no interaction other than the rather trival card draft mechanic ... which puts you at both the mercy of the draw and the draft.

Fue uno de los grandes descubrimientos del CiberChigre de Gijón en Feb2010. Es un juego de escoger acciones, con una interesante mecánica (a través de cartas que van pasando de un jugador a otro).

Clean play, with 3 quick actions per turn, with usually clear choices, yet enough depth to provide interesting decisions. A nice tension develops in deciding with the few cards dealt which actions to take - and which to pass to the opponents. Players need to focus on good hand management in order to keep up the supply of influence markers and gold, both of which are needed for taking necessary actions to gain prestige points. In close games, the rat penalty could make the difference as 2 points are lost per turn for not covering plague. UPDATE: the expansion cards seem to be a decent addition - played with them only once.

Solid, play once-every-now-and-then game.  The tradeoff between rats and points and money is an interesting one, and planning what cards of your own you want to use (guaranteed) is important.  It's a pity that one of the cars is entirely useless though (the get 1 coin/cube/-rat card).

Another game that I failed to enjoy online, but eventually came to like FTF.  So many painful choices.  I like Osiris Ra's comment: "Stefan Feld must have been abused as a child."  

So many things to do, and no way to do them all.  And the rats!  My God, the rats!

Best with 3-4.

After one play: not sure what to think. Definitely much lighter than other Feld games. Resources seem extremely tight. The order in which you have to do things seems pretty rigid (eg collect influence cubes and money first).

Big improvement in my score in my second play. A lot strategic thought goes into playing this game well. There is a definite order in doing things. Too formulaic? Will see...

Alea, Alea... so beautiful, so cold.  Every game thus far in the big box series has been wonderful, and this is no exception.  Stefan Feld is definitely the MVP of that series.  This plays as kind of a multi-player solitaire area control.  It's damn good, but it ranks third for me in the series, behind In the Year of the Dragon and Puerto Rico. Like PR, though, the endgame is usually a toss-up, altough with less tension (as you can see accumulated VP).  Another great game with lovely components, but somehow this one just doesn't set me on fire (Alea is really master of the slow-burn anyway).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Another interesting, fun, light but challenging Feld game. The actions are very simple, and the game is very easy to learn: draft cards, play cards, hire people, repeat. The choices, however, are complex, and you have to keep track of not only what other players are doing, but also what cards have already been played. If you see no one is interested in parks, maybe you should go for parks. If no one seems to be keeping their bank cards, go for the banks. 

Of course, then there are the rats. Luckily, like many of Feld's games (Trajan, Macao), the rats are punishing but no too punishing, and a good player can win even after a couple of turns of being overrun. The rats just present another tough choice, between reducing your rat population or going for a bunch of points (often the points you earn in a turn will outweigh the losses you accrue from rats).

Fun, if not a bit dry.  I'm not sure how much re-playability there is here.  I also think there's a potential for the "Puerto Rico problem", where the person to the left of a bad player will benefit greatly.  Also, passing the cards always in the same direction seems like a huge oversight in the rules.

I like the constant fight for resources on three different fronts - cubes, money and rats. I fear that there is a strong problem if somebody makes a mistake or gets very unlucky early in the game.  The runaway loser problem where one player can get mired in a death spiral and unable to climb out while all the other opponents run away.  Hopefully, it has been an unusual experience. Very nice playtime to fun ratio. Very fast turns and decisions are often fast to make leading to very little downtime. The ending is a bit anti-climatic as the game ends suddently with no final surge of points.  Going to the Notre Dame cathedral seems under-powered.

Excellent game - I really enjoy the drafting mechanic a lot, and the rat management is a nice touch.  HOWEVER, nothing about this game feels even remotely like societal development in medieval France.

So far I have played 4 2-player games. After the first two I was extremely dissapointed. After a further two I started liking it more after I understood the mechanics more and knew which cards might come up and how they can help. But still the game feels rather boring. Maybe that will improve with some more plays. Right now I am playing it hoping it will get better.

RATING: 7.5
Not too conmplex a game mechanically but the interaction of the drafting/choice of cards with the different powers they give, the need to avoid rats and the addition of the purchased abilities all makes for quite a complex gamespace which it taked a little while to grasp - you're lucky if you can do so before you're so far down the slippery slope that you keep being overwhelmed by rats, which does hurt.  That's not to say that it might not be a viable tactic to just ignore the rats and suffer - more experience is needed to judge that.  So, a fair amount to think about within a short and lightish game - rather good if not quite excellent.

UPDATE: Playing this game again recently has reminded me that it is pretty good, and I might have sold it short when I first played it. The theming is weak, but it just plays so quickly and so tightly with decent tensions, it's good fun.

I upped the rating to 8 to reflect that I think the game is great with 3 players. With 4 or 5 I think there is too much other, better stuff out there, and so maybe gets a 6 (In the Year of the Dragon hits many of the same notes for me, but has more interesting direct player interaction, and seems much better balanced, so I'd rather play that game if I had more players), but Notre Dame is very solid with 3.
---
While some early adopters have seen Notre Dame as a return to form for alea, for me I think it might be the final real evidence that the magic is gone. Notre Dame has some nice pieces to it, but it's also seriously lacking in player interaction, is a bit chaotic for its own good, and is lacking in theme. None of these things are crippling - I give it a 7 - but it also lacks anything that stands out.

To me, Notre Dame seems to exemplify the Caylus Syndrome - games that are too focussed on balancing many variables in interesting ways and not focussed enough on actually making a fun game. This multi-factorial balancing act has been done, twice actually, to good effect in Princes of Florence and Puerto Rico, both of which had good themes and some player interaction, and so they worked although they aren't among my favorites. Notre Dame is just dry. It's a fun kind of a dry, I suppose, and it does present you with agonizing choices from time to time on which card to pass, and it also plays quickly and in good time with a very brisk pace. All good. But this is still a weak entry in the alea big-box series. It seems harsh to judge it as the weakest so far (Mammoth Hunters was too long, which can be a fairly serious problem in some cases, and Fifth Avenue was great but fragile in that if players just didn't get it, it could crash and burn), but it might be.
---
Funny story: we played Monopoly at a recent game gathering (I had wanted to play it again for various reasons). It worked out pretty well. I then went on to play Tigris & Euphrates, the new edition, while Kim moved over to a game of Notre Dame.

When asked afterwards how it was, she said she liked some things, didn't like others, and generally equivocated. When asked the more straightforward question, "was it better then Monopoly?", it got a clear "no".

But the Monopoly game was pretty fun.

After one play, seems like there are multiple strategies to pursue, but your luck in succeeding in any aprticular strategy seems to depend on what cards get passed to you.

I need to play this a little more to really get the feel for it.  But when I played a three player game, it was great, seemed really strategic.  Wehn I played a five player, I realized there was very little interaction between players.  Yes, there's passing the cards to the left, but honestly, I could play this solitaire by just having three decks. the only real direct interaction comes with: A) Moving into Notre Dame, and B) Moving Carriages and taking items.

Not sure if I like it or not, but I'm willing to play it again and try it out.

RATING: 7.5
[05/04/2007] Resources are scarce and numerous trade-offs present themselves throughout the game. Cubes and money oil your economy's machine,  while rats present a threat to your neighbourhood's prosperity. This sort of economic challenge the rats pose may also be found in say Müll&Money (pollution) and Through the Ages (happiness, corruption, food consumption). These negative factors need to be kept in check. The fact that you're preoccupied to a considerable extent with fighting the game, means that player interaction tends to be relatively low (but then that's pretty common in German games). That economic motor may well stutter and suffer setbacks if you haven't planned ahead properly and failed to make sound judgements on which action cards to hold and which to pass on. This card phase features most of the player interaction found in this game, which happens to be of an indirect nature similar to Puerto Rico.As with any good economic management game, there do seem to be multiple paths to victory and choices don't appear too obvious. A very solid and well-crafted design.

Classic Euro card drafting / role selection mechanism to build an economic engine.  I would like to play it more often to further understand the card and player interactions available.

Edit: After many plays in person and many more on BSW, this is a fun game but formulaic at the highest level of play.  There is a definite limit, albeit high limit, of skill beyond which the outcome is decided by the random draw of cards.  the process to get that point is fun but, once it is reached it made me wonder why I spent so much time on it.

Another modern euro which feels very processional and mechanical, and completely lacks tension.
Very short shelf life. Finding the superior strategy (solving the puzzle) doesn't take long, and then it's just a matter of who draws best.

RATING: 6
To me, Feld isn’t a GREAT designer; I do think most of his games are fine, but I only really like two (CoB and Trajan). It just feels like something is missing in his games compared to Rosenberg’s or Knizia’s. Perhaps it’s because there are just too many ways to score points; no matter what you do, you score some points so it can sometimes be hard to estimate why I actually won or lost… Notre Dame follows the same pattern I think. It’s a big “point salad”. 

Besides that, I think the game is okay but pretty average. I did like the card selection and that you have to manage the rats. Also, the game plays quite quickly which is a big plus. Admittedly, I have only tried it with 2 and would love to try it with 4, as the 2-player game is probably much more tactical as you know you will get one of your own cards back.

It works but the theme is not strong. Mechanics: Card drafting to push cubes about which give VPs, money, more cubes, less rats and move your cart (reason not established). Counter the rat infestation or lose 2VPs and a cube (which in turn makes it harder to counter the rats so you fall further behind). Rather abstract and solitaire.

Great card drafting game that has little downtime. It's not overly complex but has a great amount of strategy. There's not a lot of variety with the characters so I probably should invest in the expansion to add some more replay, because the game can feel a bit samey. The artwork and color scheme is not very attractive making it harder to get it to the table, but There are some great choices to make in this game with what cards to draft and what cards opponents may be after. Good game to play with 2-5 players.

If you somehow combined Agricola and Castles of Burgundy, I think you'd end up with Notre Dame.  There's a lot going on, but I was able to pick the game up in about ten minutes.  The tension and decision space are excellent.  Overall, an excellent game that is should be brought back into print.  I think I prefer Castles of Burgundy (as Notre Dame is more prone to feeling like point salad), but it is a close call.

Well, after reading the rules, I thought I would really really like this one. Sounded like it had a lot of the same premises as Le Havre.

After playing, I was left a little disappointed - but perhaps that is from my high expectations. The game felt like it ended to early, and since you can't really pick out the cards you want to play, felt a lot more tactical than strategic. 

Still, it had a lot of good points, and we did enjoy ourselves. Will probably play a few more times before forming a final opinion on this one.

This game puts you in catch up mode on turn 2 and doesn't let go.  You have to keep up with your cubes and money, move your carriage, take care of your rats, and collect victory points when you really only have the time to do half of that.  Instead of the common feeling of needing to do 3 things with 2 actions, you need to do 5 things with 2 actions, and 1 of those actions is dictated to you by the other players.  Great game.

Great, medium weight mechanics. Theme is basically tacked on.  Nicely illustrated and fun to play in this little world, but the them really adds little to the gameplay.  It's a shame because these mechanics with a more cohesive theme would really kick the game up into excellence for me.  

Played 2 players and it played well although it seems like there would be a bit more depth in 3 or more players given the way the card drafting system works.  

Good game, just a tad short of a great medium weight worker placement game.

RATING: 7
Notre Dame is one of those super fillers for gamers... takes about 30 to 45 minutes to play, and offers tough choices in a short time span. The heart of Notre Dame is the drafting mechanic... and this is not friendly 7 Wonders drafting, as I find myself more consciously "hate drafting" to deny my neighbors cards they need.

Notre Dame takes a few plays to learn the balance between fending off the rats and going for point grabs. Familiarity also helps you leverage the people you hire for special perks. I've played this a handful of times as a two player game, but I think this is really best with 3+ players.

My only knock is that the components are average... on par with Puerto Rico and the other Alea games. 

Update: Well, with Notre Dame out of print, I sold this game in an auction. It's a solid game and one I enjoy, but I don't need to own it. My wife didn't like it enough as a two player game, and I'm trying to keep a manageable collection of games that I really want to play.

UPDATE: After a few more plays, this title has lost it's luster.  Not sure why exactly, but suspect it is a bit too much multi-player solitaire.

A few mechanisms come to mind.  You have a deck of 9 cards, you draw three, keep one, and everyone passes their remaining two cards to the player on their left.  Everyone keeps one of this passed pair, and passes the remaining card to their left.  Thus you start a round with three cards, one of which is from your stack, one is from the stack of your neighbor to the right and a third is from the player on his right.  During the round you play two of the three cards, discarding the third without revealing it.

Two interesting side notes - none of the cards is "bad" thus you always have a deliciously difficult decision in what to keep and what to pass.

Secondly,  the way the people to your right are playing effects your possible strategies.  Example, last night John and Matt were moving their carriages like nuts, I almost never did - in part because the only carriage card I ever saw was the one in my deck . . . and it wasn't always the one of my three cards I most desired to keep.


During a turn, you place influence markers, doing so immediately produces a result, while at the same time increasing your influence (and therefore the result you get) in that area of your board.  Thus there is the aspect of an area control game as well as an action-activation game, without making you think - oh this is like El Grande.

And you don't "just have cubes" you have gold to manage as well - i.e. you have two resources (plus others perhaps) to manage simultaneously.

Influence in Notre Dame costs gold in addition to influence, immediately produces victory points, and at the end of a round gives those with influence in Notre Dame victory points - per cube equal to a sent number divided by the total number of cubes in the Notre Dame pool.  i.e. more cubes from different players lowers the prestige scored for any single cubes, more cubes.  But think about this interaction.  Say I put a cube on ND early, then a second cube . . . now anyone not in the pool has to say . . . damn, how much is ND worth to me since my cube will only get me 1/3 of the VPs available.

Then you have the whole rat thing - at the end of each round you can lay for the services of one of three "artisans" I'll call them.  Characters that help you.   In turn order you choose one of them, and pay one gold for their help.  They are not exclusive to you, the other players can enlist their services as well.

On the bottom of these three character cards is a number of rats, after the artisan round, each player increases the number of rats in the Cartier* by this number minus the influence they have in their Quarter's hospital.  If you accumulate more than 9 rats, you suffer VP and influence loss.  It turns out, avoidance of the rat plague can be a big issue - and another interesting mechanism.

Finally, the game has a lot of paths to victory, you're often faced with several good ways to proceed, and the delicious choice between them.

It might suffer from players with AP, but not as much as some games as the analysis required isn't monumental.

The tao of gaming review here on BGG covers the game mechanics well.

All in all I found it a refreshing game in a market that I feel is awash with a drove of "convert your cubes to gold" clones.

Is it the best game ever?  No, but I'm not sure I can think of a game I've enjoyed the first play of more that was produced in the past two years.

So far, after two plays, I just don't get it. I got the game because it plays well with two and doesn't have a ton of options on any given turn. These are criteria for a game my wife will like. Anyway, so far it seems to completely lack tension. Player interaction is minimal despite the drafting. And somehow, choices don't seem to really matter. I'll keep trying, though. Maybe with more players...

RATING: 3
There's surprising subtlety here but the game itself lacks both charm and humanity and almost deserves the multiplayer solitaire epithet. It reminds me most of a little clockwork puzzle: cute, clever, operational and pointless.  The only significant player interaction comes from the card passing (which is very dilute and uninteresting) and the very minor race game of the buggies for market chips.  The rest of the game is a relatively straightforward if internally complexly timed efficiency race driven by the weak interactions of the card passing.  

The game itself falls into two phases: 1) Getting cubes onto the board for profit, and 2) Moving cubes already on the board about profitably.  Both are efficiency games, controlled variously by the resource limits of rats, money, cubes and the card draft.  Opportunism rules.  The buildings provide a variety of ways to self-reinforcingly specialise  That pattern partly drives the card passing decisions while simultaneously devalueing it: there is too much advantage to being out of phase with the neighbour on your right to make the card passing truly interesting.

The drafting-mechanism feels misplaced and pasted on an otherwise multiplayer solitaire game. The administration effort is a bit too high (the separated scoring of the Notre Dame location especially is unrewarding extra-work)
Points, points, points, that is what it's all about and I'm completely fine with that. But I want something that translates to points, like goods, buildings and cards, not  point-tokens with numbers on them. 
Also, the language-neutral components are annoying, because you have to constantly look up the persons' abilities.

This game has a SWEET board. It's completely language independant and it's modular! I enjoyed letting my city become overrun by rats and plague. Every now and then I'd kill a rat or two, but we all know how quickly germs spread so it didn't help much. I like card passing design - unique and interesting. I also like little wooden squares. They come in 5 colors - one for each player. They are nice.

Straight up Euro style resource management game but without the usual money-now-points-later type of engine building aspect to it.

It's main interest is due to the positive feedback loops in many of the choices (the more you do something, the bigger the pay-off for doing it). So, for me, this game is a classic case of find a path or resource that can pay-off for you and abuse the heck out of it while doing just enough to make sure that you don't lose too many points for neglecting other things. 

The randomness in the game is interesting and appropriate for this sort of game. The card passing aspect feel familiar because of other games like hearts. 

I sense the theme and recognize how the theme and the mechanics fit but the theme isn't exciting to me. Typically, if a game's mechanics successfully engage me, then I don't care as much about the theme (it's that way for me with Caylus - love the game, don't care about the theme). However, when the mechanics don't "wow" me then I need more from the theme and Notre Dame doesn't offer that to me. This isn't a poor reflection on the game. It's simply a reflection of my tastes.

This was, apparently a great game when it came out 7 years ago. To me, having played it now for the first time, it seemed dry and uninteresting. 

The spacial element of the cart seems underdeveloped and disjointed from the rest and the persons cards a late "special ability" addition. Which leaves the main influence building mechanism and the interesting (but not novel anymore) modular board. Not enough..

Sold it off.

Solid cube-pusher. Theme (What theme?) pasted on. I quite like the card selection mechanism, the problem is that you always get the cards from the same players throughout the game. Other than that, not much interaction or excitement here. Resources are scarce and must be managed efficiently, which is good, and fighting the rats is reasonably fun. Artwork bland and uninspiring but not horrible.

RATING: 7
This is a very solid game...and although there are many familiar elements here, there is also something very fresh feeling. I think it has to do with the card drafting/passing mechanic, which I really dig. 

There is some subtle management of hidden information, a bit of luck of the cards, and some rich decision-making....but its all tied together well in a very tight package.

I can't think of another game that would make this one redundant. Of its peers from the same year, I think this is probably the big keeper of the bunch.

What a weird game to rate, I wanted to give it an 8, then went to 7. It's a medium weight game like Ra that plays extremely fast. It's not something that is going to be worth studying (I hope...) or something that will be the main event on any evening, but it'll be a game that you'll pull out at the start or end of a session, run through, and enjoy. It's only an hour with 5 people who know it, and I imagine the 3 player game could be cranked out in 30-45 minutes, easily.

What is this game about? Simply put: 9 actions. You have a deck with 1 of each of those actions. Each round you draw 3 cards at random from the deck (though each 3 rounds you get to all 9 cards, 9 rounds total), keep 1, pass 2 to the left. Pick 1 from the pile your right hand neighbour left behind, give the left guy the last card from that pile, and then pick up the last card form the right, which was originally part of person 2 seats away's hand. You then execute the actions. This is the same short Magic draft system that Fairy Tale used a couple of years ago, and it works here very well.

The core of the actions are all dominated by an El Grande court vs. provinces cube situation. Anytime you take an action, you drop a cube from your court into that area. As cubes build up, you aren't fighting for majorities, rather, you are simply trying to specialize. Put 1 guy in the bank, you get 1 buck. Put another there, you get 2 bucks, and so forth. Basic actions let you do that to get money, VPs, more guys from the provinces to the court, and so on. There are also ND specific ideas such as a rat menace (which some placements can hinder or eliminate) and bonus points available for going to the cathedral and tithing. The carriage is the final weird area, and is the only player interaction outside of the "everything in this game centres on it" draft, as the carriage lets you move around the board and pick up chits, some of which are on the other player's little sub-boards. At the end of each round, money is used to execute special actions. After each 3 rounds, the cathedral square in the centre of the board hands out VPs from a zero sum pool, so if too many people are there, each person will end up with less points per piece placed.

Now, this game fits together exceptionally well, and I think is is actually original, which is really saying something in this era. Specialization is clearly the right road to take in the abstract, as having a bunch of guys built up in any given area is very worthwhile. Being able to get 4$ per action, or a trio of guys, or a metric boatload of points is far superior to being able to do everything simply ok. The rub is that your ability to do most actions depends heavily on what people are passing you though, and in experienced groups, having a very powerful pair of actions means that you are going to have a hard time convincing people to pass the cards you want.

Like Magic draft, you want to not pick what the other people are taking. So, your first picks are huge, you are effectively sending signals to the player on your left about what you're willing to let through, and this forces them down certain avenues. Also like Magic draft, and as alluded to above, after a certain point, you have to cut them off, because certain abilities become ridiculous given enough specialization. In that regard, I think this is a game like Puerto Rico, where there are going to be tonnes of complaints about the weak player passing good stuff too much, so be prepared.

The scaling should offer some interesting options (particularly the 3 scale, where everyone is passing to everyone else, I would be interested in playing with 3 with Magic draft rules (i.e.: rounds 1-3: pass clockwise, 4-6 counter, 7-9 clock) as well.

Strategically, I think there is a lot of wiggle room...most of the actions are potentially good if they're used in the right way, at the right time. There are some you don't want a load of cubes on, but I think all of them are situationally good, and many of them are ungodly powerful if you can load them up with big number of people (i.e.; VP farm, Cube farm early, Bank). The Park seems like it will become better as people are more experienced, as it is less effective than the VP farm in the abstract, but it is also much more difficult to thwart, as there are a lot of ways to generate trophy bum bonus points.

Side note: Love the theme on this one, or at least the way we mangled it. Some of the mechanics are incredibly amusing if you're twisted enough in your approach to them. The Hospital creating a rat vortex for one, or the entertaining park, where pieces build up which destroy rats and then can provide extra VPs...the thematic idea? The pieces are bums. They eat the rats when they show up. They generate VPs because being able to afford having them in your district conveys a certain amount of prestige (i.e.: conspicuous consumption for that era, having bums makes you one of the "in" kids). Hence, we refer to them as trophy bums throughout the game. This sort of stuff makes the game fantastic in a ridiculousity factor 10 sort of way, and makes me enjoy it more.

I love this game.  The theme certainly feels a bit pasted on.  This is one of those "agonizing decision" type games, where the scarcity of resources makes you always wishing that you had that one more cube to place, or one more coin.  There is a definite tension, feeling that you are always teetering on the precipice.

It's almost a great game.  Each round the stakes get incrementally higher and a poor start is hard to recover from.  Each round depends on how solid your turns have been up to that point.  If you get behind on your strategy problems can just compound themselves.  There's lots of ways to get points to win, but in the end it just seems too rigid and experienced players have too huge of an advantage over new players because they know the cards likely to come up and know some of the more important ways to develop. Also, the drafting mechanism gives people whose turn is after weaker, less strategic players a bit too much of an advantage over everyone else.

Something about this game really drew me in. It played pretty darn quick, clocking in at a little over an hour. 

I love the card drafting mechanic. I do not play in CCG tournaments, so almost never get to use that. This seemed to be a major strategy when playing, as I was screwed or was able to screw another player by sending over just the right cards. Damn you Kostas!

I also think that the drafting is a solution to perceived problem that there has a largely a solitaire feel to the game. Playing pieces into Notre Dame and moving the coach also allow an interactive way to screw with your opponents.

I also happen to love the rats. Those little guys are vicious and can really ruin your game by costing you a lot of victory points.

I think Notre Dame is deceptively complex.  It has an interesting learning curve.  You start out, you don't have the offical cards memorized yet, so you have one level of play.  Once you know that certain officials will be appearing and start planning for them, you have another.  Once the entire group does, you have a third.  The card drafting is similarly progressive.  When you start understanding the game and being able to pay attention not only to what you're doing, but to what others are doing, it gets really interesting.

Not totally sure about this one. After 3 or 4 plays (only 3 players each time), I still don't feel "settled" on my oppinion. I will say this: the board design is very clever. I just wish there was more significance to the board than just the cars (a very small part of the game). It seems like a huge opportunity lost. I do like that the game plays really quickly once people are familiar with it. It's almost Goa-like in its multiplayer solitaire-ness. Sometimes I like games like that, but usually I prefer games with a bit more player interaction. I think I'm more likely to drop my rating than raise it. Believe it or not, I actually prefer the designer's (and Alea's) previous game: Rum & Pirates. I know I'm the odd man out on that one.

Your ``own'' random draw is manageable, being subject to the dregs of your right hand neighbors draw is acceptable, what really lowers my rating here is the fact that your neighbors have a random draw that is nearly impossible to track. There is also a noticeable lack of player interaction (accepting that each player follows the simple algorithm of passing the worst part of their hand).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Reading the rules and explaining them is always a lot easier than I envisage. There is a rythm to them which makes learning them easier, even more so once you begin to learn what the symbols on the game material mean. I could even point out a mistake in the original German edition: when bribing the Bishop, you are allowed to take an action of the quarter you move the cube too; this is not mentioned in the rules. However, some of the pictograms are not very clear, but you can't have everything.

The game itself is a fairly standard but well-executed excercise in 'multiple ways to victory'. (But see below.) Players must juggle various actions and conflicting goals in order to obtain as much victory points as possible; according to the rule book this indicates proper taking care of a district of medieval Paris. As far as I'm concerned, that's a load of thematic crap: the only thing which ties the game to Paris is the Notre Dame, and even that building just represents an action amongst many. The game could have been easily called 'Kölner Dom' or 'Westminster Abbey' instead. Oh, and there's a hunchback. Okay, two items which tie the game to Paris then.

Contrary to popular opinion, I am of the opinion that player interaction in this game is [u]minimal[/u]. You see your opponents on three occasions: card swapping, the Notre Dame, and the carriages. The card swapping has you sending off two cards to your neighbours, but since you have little control over what you get, in most cases you keep the card which is the best for your own position. When another player is 'obviously' persuing a certain strategy, then yes, your choices will be influenced by it. Otherwise, you simply maximise your own profits. As for the carriage racing: the game imposes a strict set collection routine which equalises interaction even further. The Notre Dame, yes, that's a place where people can truly 'fight' each other. But it's a limited part of the game. Conclusion: most of the time you're on your own, so why bother at all with what the others do? My first games were with 2 players, but I doubt that things would be very different with 3 or more. (Later games with 3 players confirmed this suspicion.) The game is tantalisingly calculable: I never felt that agonising decisions were forced upon me. In some games, I played fairly calculatingly, ignoring rats for most of the game, and miraculously finished first without too much effort. There didn't seem to be anything else to do. In other games, the cards didn't cooperate, forcing all kinds of untimely decisions on me, and so I finished nearly last. Once again, there didn't seem to be anything else to do. 

In the end, Notre Dame left me on the cool side of luke warm. The busy and frilly artwork isn't particularly appealing, although the odd board shape is an eyecatcher for sure. It had me thinking of Hermagor at one point: a nearly endless source of small amounts of points which seem to accumulate no matter what you do. My sweetheart is by now very astute at reading my body language and cut me off before the first sentence left my mouth: 'We are NOT selling this game, [i]I[/i] like it!'. (I have a habit of selling games I don't like much.) Very well, the game will not be sold. But neither will it be loved very much.

Feels too much like multi-player solitaire.  There is minor interactivity in the sharing of Notre Dame points, and in race for messages -- but the 2nd can be mostly ignored.  Also, to some extent you could burn the player to your left -- but you're almost always better holding cards for yourself than hurting both that player and yourself, especially so the more players playing.  In a 2 or 3-player game, might be more influence.

I love the concept of the game, and how the cards can have different levels of use for different players depending on their strategies and the luck of the draw.

You can buy this at Boardgamebliss. It's the German edition but totally icon driven, just print the English PDF rules. US shipping isn't bad. The used asking price of this game is obscene.


Have the basegame and the expansion.

As is, very good 3 card draft game. 

Notes to self:

My problem here is the Icons on the Juggler card doesn't reflect you can move a cube from Notre Dame, the from Icon is the same as the Minstrel, just your district, where game text in the rule book explicitly leaves it out for the Minstrel but states it for the Juggler.

"The BSW rules are slightly different again: for both the minstrel and the juggler the rule says you move a cube/s from 'one of your own spaces'.
Stefan Brück has confirmed that in theory using the minstrel or juggler, you can move your own cube/s out of Notre Dame but that in practice you would never actually want to do so. Certainly with the minstrel, where you don't get to carry out the action of the new building, you would never want to move out of Notre Dame, 'which [says Stefan] is why we don't list it explicitly'."

Basically the rule is only card play moves the Trusted Friend. If you have no cubes in your personal stock you can't move your Trusted Friend.

"Situations where you can move your Trusted Friend:

1.) Playing the Trusted Friend card.
2.) Hiring the Minstrel.
3.) Hiring the Fool.

In other words, the Trusted Friend counts as an influence marker for all the persons you can hire who account for the presence or absence of influence markers.

Notably, you cannot move your Trusted Friend if you play a card but have no cubes to add to the board (thus forcing you to use a cube already on the board to do your action)."

9.10.11 I've played this once and I think it is a game I would really like. I understood the game just not how to make it smooth with my strategy. I focused too much on one area that really killed my score. Rats are only bad if they go above the track. My brother ended on the highest space without going over and was able to put those actions not used on rats to good use. My 0 rat score didn't do me any good.

The carriage pickup option seems sort of tacked on or out of character with the rest of the game.

RATING: 4
I never owned this, but I have played it and wanted to add it to my collection as a reminder to not buy it.  I know this game is rated 7.4 on BGG, so I am in the minority here.

Here's the good:  Visually, very appealing.  I love the Euro feel.  Some of the mechanics were spot on and fun.

Here's the bad:  Too many mechanics.  At a certain point, it is just too much.  It is a lengthy game.  I don't mind a lengthy game (90 minutes max), but it has to pay excellent dividends for that type of investment.

To be fair, I could play it a few more times to iron out some strategy kinks, but I can't bring myself to pay the price in time and energy.

I find it hard to articulate what I like so much about this game, but it's still a favorite after many plays. Complex enough to be interesting, with many workable strategies. Play can go to another level entirely with careful consideration of upstream players' decks and likely choices, among other things - and I know there are people far better than I at the game, so there's probably layers I haven't hit yet. I'm still happily exploring.

Played this at least a half dozen times now, (mostly with 4p, a couple with 3p) and it is definitely one of my favorite games.  I love the fact that you have so many resources to maintain (money, cubes, rat control, and oh yeah, points!) with never enough turns.  The card drafting/passing mechanism usually provides some serious angst a few turns a game, and I've seen at least 3 different roads to victory.  My kind of game!

Rating has improved from 7.5 (currently May, '08).  I was hopelessly lost the first game, but did much better the second time and think I have a pretty good idea how to play now.  This is pretty much the poster child for a game where you want to do way more than you are able to do.  Having to give actions you want to your opponents makes that dilemma even nastier.

One of my favorites.  The first play brings the pressure dealing with the rats, but with additional plays they are much more manageable.  
Engine development happens very quickly once you get the hang of it, letting you switch your engine up when needed.
Norte Dame gives you a ton of fun and replay without having too many moving parts.  Great board system with a tight design.

RATING: 8
A game of prioritisation and adaptation.

I love drafting in games. It simplifies decisions, allowing us to choose between just a few choices and allows for 'fairness' and randomness to coexist.

9 action cards exist and each turn, 3 are drawn, one picked, 2 passed, 2 received, 1 picked, 1 passed, 1 recieved. You must then perform 2 of the 3 actions you hold. After 3 turns, action cards are dealt back and the whole process is repeated twice more.

This potentially denies you an action on the turn you desire - forcing you to adapt - whilst, over the course of 3 turns, giving you first pick over any card you prioritise.

The actions give rewards proportional to the number of times chosen. Whilst this encourages specialisation, the game forces generalisation by throwing a few factors at you that must be dealt with in good time. The cubes you place must first be obtained from a supply. The plague level increases each turn and will prove ruinous if too high. Money must similarly be managed.

Various actions are best used earlier or later in the game, when certain resources are running low or when underused by others. However, each seems of roughly equal benefit.

Ultimately a game of prioritisation the game has enough variables that I doubt a single strategy would ever prove unbeatable - you'll be seeing a different order of cards each game, facing different choices from opponents and will be forced to adapt.

This one just didn't click for me.  Mostly I didn't care for the drafting mechanism as I felt like you didn't have nearly enough control over the cards you draft (which determines your actions).  I also didn't like the constant feeling of doom as you fight off the rats.

It's funny. I like Castles of Burgundy. But these other Felds are some of the driest, most boring apathetic games I've played.

Unlike the Speahieihdcjjist, this game is more complicated and much longer. Which means the dullness keeps going.

What is this game about? What does it have to do with Notre Dame? What's with the rats? What's with the little buggies driving around? Why does it all feel so disjointed and pasted together?

RATING: 6
Very Stefan Feld game with mechanisms combined together to build another semi themeless game. It's fun once in a while, though as the game itself is interesting. But who am I in the game again? More euro renaissance 'fun'.  Like the rats, though.

The fact that a few years after playing I can't remember if I liked it or not is probably enough reason to stay away.

Not too sure about the plague, though... doesn't seem dangerous enough. It can (almost) be completely ignored.

Interesting system resource management game. Quick, but not shallow at all, its main feature is the card draft, thus joining together players interaction and the source of randomness.

I really enjoy this game. There are several paths to victory and many interesting decisions. The card drafting mechanic is oftentimes gut-wrenching, but always worthwhile. The threat of the plague always looms over every player's head, but there are many ways to mitigate this threat. Fans of Puerto Rico and Goa may very well like this game. This rating may very well move up to a 9 with repeated plays. Recommended.

Cool! A game about the black death! Rats, racing carriages, "El Grande-esque" cube placement and card drafting. What's not to like?
I particularly like the defined decks which provide some nice balance and the agonising decisions about which card to keep when drawing 3 killer (or killed) cards.
Several ways to earn points from several interlocking mechanisms all smoothly handled. Alea back on form!

Game has lots of VP acceleraters.  Focus first on building your capabilities (workforce, rat defense, and money), then focus on accelerating VP collection and done...Some activities like collecting tokens from around the board or going to the location where you get choice of coin, worker, or rat kill, are a waste of time since they provide no acceleraters.Building a moderate rat defense at hospital early is worth it to delay being in the penalty.  Once the rats overwhelm the defense, in the last third of the game, more points are scorable elsewhere instead of wasting effort fighting the rats.

The rats can punish you, and it's very tempting to not deal with them early enough.  BUT if you can score better than the penalty, just let them take over your town.  The card drafting is also very interesting, table position will be nearly as important as in Puerto Rico, so choose your seat carefully.  Also, NEVER give up your Notre Dame card.

There is a lot of luck here, which equates to bad luck for me, usually.  That was dominant in my first few plays, and consequently I didn't care for Notre Dame.  But repeated plays have shown how to mitigate that a bit.  Now I can say I'd happily play if someone suggested it.

Some really neat bits that really want to have a game added to them.  The card drafting seems like a good way to power the neat tech tree mechanic, but it actually isn't.  The entire table will groan and glare at the person to your right when you play an off-color VP card.  If the tech tree idea was done in to a completely different game, then it would be sweet.

Good strategic game. You draft cards which dictate the strategy you will pursue. However, there's very little interaction.  Is there an optimal route to victory?   Is there too much luck in how the draft plays out (only a 3 card draft)?  Do all games play out in the same manner?  I think the answer to the above questions is "no".  This game is worth picking up.  I'll probably hold off however since several others already own it.

Notre Dame was another game I played at Coolstuff on Wednesday nights. I admit I was a bit curious about the game before I played it, particularly considering that its designer also made In the Year of the Dragon, which I was quite fond of. Unfortunately, I ended up being pretty underwhelmed by it. The game was "fine." There wasn't anything specifically wrong with it, but there was nothing about it that thrilled me, and I have yet to play it again.

Players represent nobles, accumulating prestige in Paris.  Players deal a mini-hand of 3 cards to themselves, keep one and pass two on.  Repeat, passing one on.  Then two of the three cards they are holding can be played for actions.  Actions do the usual things - move cubes around, managing bad stuff, gain victory points and money.  Most victory points wins at the end of the nine turns.  Standard stuff, but it's quick to play and works well.  I like the modular board.

alright, tight mechanics, cool card trade thing, just not very exciting for me.

Update: I raised this a point.  When this first came out there was a barrage of Cathedral/Castle building games many with worker placement Caylus ripoff stuff.  My first reaction to this game was "oh god not another one."  Now that time has passed and I've re-visited the game, mostly because I love In the Year of the Dragon, I enjoy Notre Dame more.

This really stands out compared to the above genre.  Mechanically it's quite different than all the Caylus type games.  It tells a different story of the same subject.  While the cathedral/castle building genre bores me the game itself does not and has an atmosphere all it's own. Perhaps it's the Paris setting.

First impressions: I think the language neutrality of the cards was a mistake on his one. Some text (even the name of the buildng!) would have been very helpful.  After playing: This is a quintessential Euro.  To me, it feels a lot like a game of Caylus played just on the favors track, with a card draft thrown in.  My wife and I like it a lot, and games so far have been very close.  However, I wonder if it's even possible to far too far behind, as most moves are worth almost the same.  The victory seems to go to the one who is able to squeeze out those 2 or 3 extra points somewhere along the way.  I like the constant pressure exerted by the rat track.

UPDATE: Still enjoying the game after putting it away for a while.  Yes, the game is hella processional, but it massages some part of my brain in happy way.  I think it is the amplifying payouts for each sector - nothing like seeing an investment pay off.

A game of micro-actions with a little bit of card drafting to make it interesting.   In many ways, it reminds me of Yspahan in the way you take small actions to crank out VPs.  There's not a whole lot of interaction, so you mainly just do your thing.  The game also relies heavily on shorting you of everything you need.  You'll never have enough cards, enough cubes, enough money, or rat control.  I didn't think this would have much staying power, but somehow the more I play it the more I like it.   Makes a nice casual game as long as you aren't annoyed by the shortages.

Pretty impressed after first play and was very fun. I particularly like the card-playing mechanic as it is interesting to have to balance your needs with your opponent's needs. It seems to lack a little bit in player interaction and it seemed to have a little too much balance. But there does appear to be multiple paths to victory to explore in future plays.

Neat card drafting, action selection, area influence (disguised worker placement) alea Big Box. Not much of a point salad since the ways to score points are clear and concise and not everything is giving points. It has brilliant modular (albeit static) board representing city of Paris, with Notre Dame in the middle. It plays fast and I am not yet convinced some of the city sectors are any good (looking at you parks).

[b]Favorite mechanism:[/b] Actions that give more powerful bonus the more influence markers associated sector has.

good combination of managing action/money to convert to points. multiple paths, various options but must control rats and have cubes for action (too many choices - good thing) with accumulating affects.  a bit on the long side (for 5). neet card passing mechanic. like the way to do a variable board. 

but like all role selection - there are lots of roles and helpers.  good language independent use of symbols.

Notre Dame was our first Feld game and was an instant hit.  The modular board is really clever and I like the mechanic which means that the rewards increase based on how many cubes are on a particular space.  Very well balanced and great for 2 or more players.

A series of very tough decisions. A drafting mechanism ensures players never quite get exactly what they want, so everyone needs to set off down a path to victory, as each decision reinforces the rewards for sticking with a path. Good fun, reminds me of the tough gameplay of In the Year of the Dragon.

Hey, Alea big-box games are interesting again!

Notre Dame is a game where you have to make the best of what you have and try to make a point generating machine. Now that probably sounds bad, but that is probably my favorite genre of Eurogame: multiple ways to win, some chance to make it exciting, and one slip-up doesn't necessarily put you out of the running. We really enjoyed the two-player game and I hope to play with more players soon.

UPDATE: Played with three. Still quite fun.

RATING: 6
A quick euro instilled with a drafting mechanism. I thought it was decent. There is nothing particularly wrong with it, but there also wasn't anything that particularly grabbed me when I played it. I think a lot of people would enjoy this. It is less heavy than many of Feld's recent games however. I'd strongly recommend trying to acquire the cards in the Alea Treasure Chest expansion for this game because it increases the replay value of the game.

Edit: Get the 10th Anniversary Edition as it includes the additional Alea Treasure Chest cards and more new cards on top of that. In addition, they have better balanced the Hotel. You can also get a Castles of Burgundy expansion with this to add to that game, or subsidize the cost of this one.

Received in Trade March 1, 2012.

First play, 4/7/12, 2-player with my daughter.  We both were pretty lost, my daughter more so.  I focused on points and avoiding the plague.  She kept getting stuck without cubes and money.  She also did not utilize the carriage, which I used quite a bit.  I beat her by almost 30 points.

Need to play again to rate.  I don't know if I like it yet.  I didn't dislike it, so that is something at least.  I do know that I'm interested in playing it again.

Traded for TZAAR 9/4/13.

I was disappointed with this game. Rat problem was not amusing and it was boring to notice that player after player used the same means repeatedly.

Now after some years, I gave it another try - maybe because I was very tired after staying awake for 24 hours, which corresponds about one permille drunkenness. If I would have been in better condition, I wouldn't have accepted this game. 
And that strengthened my opinion, I didn't find any good thing from that game this time either. There's no depth, everything is so dry and the fact that game board looks very ugly doesn't make it better.

RATING: 4
Notre Dame is yet another flavorless point salad from Feld. Its obvious from the start, that specializing in a few buildings is optimal, and keeping tabs on the plague is key. Aside from that, the game is straightforward and uninteresting. Strangely, the board itself is the best part of the game. The way they sectors can be reoriented to suit each play size is an incredible design, but the board is essentially unnecessary. Other than the extraneous carriage movement, the board serves no purpose, other than looking drab. Unless you happen to be a Feld completionist, stay away.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Great game. Typical Alea physical quality, which is to say okay. The cardboard coins, VP counters, and messages are really too thin. The main boards are much thicker but also too thin. The purple cubes are too close to the black cubes. The "red" message counters are barely orange.

I liked that I was able to come in second after deciding to let the rats have their way and see if I could get enough prestige points to offset them.  I came away with impression that this game is effectively strategic.  One play is not going to tell that though, especially since I've been reading that letting the rats win is perhaps a winning strategy.

Is it effectively enjoyable?  Not sure about that yet - I need to play a few more times and seeing if its possible to manage your opponents' play through card passing.  Seems to have my Caylus problem (all structure, no drama) but I did find it more dynamic than Caylus at least.

Scales well from 2-5, plays quickly, very streamlined gameplay and easy to learn, enough luck to have good replay value, fantastic components, not overly brain-burning (in most cases you need to choose from one of three options, so a limited number of choices, and no analysis paralysis) - a very good light weight euro, quick play time, very favorably impressed after multiple plays.  Minus points: Not a huge amount of interaction; the cards are language independent, and don't have names of characters and buildings on the cards.
Also owned: the 9 expansion cards from the Alea [gameid=40688] - these change the long term strategies considerably, and minimize the need for cubes on the board towards the end.  

See my pictorial review: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/622626/a-pictorial-overview-why-i-love-notre-dame-and-w

[q]Notre Dame is and remains an outstanding euro, and several years after graduating off the production line as part of the class of 2007, has to be considered one of the highest achievers of the light-medium games from that year, by typifying some of the best that the genre can offer. It doesn't quite have the depth of classics like Puerto Rico or Caylus, but compensates for this by being more accessible, and serves well as a somewhat lighter and quicker game that is both intuitive and elegant. Yet it's not to be underestimated or considered as a game of luck - far from it, because Notre Dame offers tense and interesting decisions that require you to manage risk and manipulate a very tight economy, and carefully construct long range plans for your point-scoring objectives. There's just the right balance between tactical choices and strategic options, and the card drafting keeps the game interactive without being overly confrontational, while the finite number of possibilities keep the game from bogging down with analysis paralysis. It's not too heavy, and yet there's also not a sense that so much strategic fat has been trimmed from the design that the end result is muddied by excessive randomness or that game-play becomes a mere shuffling of cardboard and wood with no real flavour, as is the case with some euros we've seen over the years. In many respects I suppose it is an exercise in efficiency, as many euros are, but the random draw of the cards forces you to plan different paths each game, the draft mechanic adds elements of fun and indirect interaction, and the risk management associated with the rats adds tension, all of which prevent it from being categorized with the mundane or blase. In the final analysis, this is no ordinary cube-pushing euro, and while it doesn't pretend to compete with the heavier games in the genre and won't please everyone's tastes, it remains one of the more shining examples of how good a lighter and medium weight euro really can be.

For any serious fan of Notre Dame, the new grey person cards are an absolute must have, and I highly, highly recommend them. Notre Dame has always performed strongly in our house, and the replay value and freshness offered by these expansion cards only makes it better. It's amazing what swapping in and mixing nine different cards can do! All roads do lead to Notre Dame, but as this expansion proves, there's more than one way to get there! [/q]

This game is an excellent mix of resource management and card drafting with just the right amount of restrictiveness for me. While you might have certain combinations you want to play, the card draft should prevent that such that you have to adapt to what you have. 

The fun is doing that more skillfully than your opponents. Interaction is indirect but still interesting with the cards you pass each other and going to ND. An old design at this point but one I find holds up.

Tough, brutal game that you think is easy to master until the second turn and you''re behind the eightball  trying to keep up. The plague chart is perhaps a bit too brutal (thought  there are definiltey ways to offset it), but despite that the game still is very interesting.

I was really surprised by this. Its a really nicely designed game. You need to watch out and maintain your rat population or you can quickly become swamped as the population can suddenly leap up.

The action selection draft is nice and the action are simple however there are still interesting decisions to be made as you are only going to play two of the three actions.

The people each round initially seemed overpowered however the limited coins make it really interesting as it might be more advantageous to only gain 3VP and get a coin back than to plough ahead and gain 6-8VP but not get your coin back.

Notre dame itself is really nice way to churn up the victory points however it removes your cubes from the board so you then have to buy them back, to place them again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
It has it's down sides. Several. You are very limited by your card draw. If you simply don't pick up the right three cards at the right time, there's not a lot you can do. I'm not a fan of card-drafting nowadays. It's not player inter-action, it's just an exercise in doing the least worst. Some cards require a pre-condition (having money or cubes to spare) that if you can't meet, makes the card worthless to you, but the card is still too good to pass on. If you run out of money, you're stuffed. If you get into a bad cycle, you stay in a bad cycle, it's hard to work out of a poor start. If you get behind in the game, you stay behind, especially if you can't manage the rat population. You can end the game with crap, worthless choices. Not fun. All of which makes the game much heavier than it appears, or needs to be. Guess who lost. Badly. I liked the board design. Some of the actions were intersting, but there are too many options and too few opportunities. I'd say Notre Dame compares very poorly with San Marco for example, where you have the same variety of choice, but the game is stuffed with player inter-action and tough decisions, but can be played tsraight out of the box. Notre Dame is one of those games that you have to play through at least once to know how to play it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Provides a great "bang for the buck" because the price is reasonable and the game's depth is surprising given the relatively short playing time.  The design is such that you can never do everything you would like (which is a good thing).  Players need to keep an eye on rats, money, resource cubes, and VP opportunities all at the same time.

While there isn't a huge amount of interaction, there is card trading and a race for carriage tiles.  Deciding when to go into Notre Dame is key.  It provides extra points, but the point value diminishes if other players go in (a resource cube is also lost back to the general supply).  Great stuff!  Grade: B+

Very smooth and easy to play, this is my new favorite of the economic Eurogames (topping St. Petersburg and Puerto Rico).  Can't wait to play more!  I like how over many games you can develop a style of play that you enjoy and explore.  It's fun to have your own board to organize.  I think the bits and large cards are fantastic!  When the itch to set up an economy and harvest victory points hits, this is the game I'll play.

Update: I haven't played it as much as I thought I would.  I need to dive back into it.  It's a game I like but I'm not sure I really 'get'.

Update:  Lowering the rating to a 7.  I like the game but it's nothing special for me.  To a degree it has the Amyitis syndrome where the board feels like a dart board of options each turn and it's hard to tell where you're going or who you are in the game.  Scattered with no central visual flow to make sense of it.  It feels abstract to me in that it's nothing more than a points engine, and points alone are not an exciting story for a board game.  At least not interesting for me to get it off the shelf very often.  Another strike against this game is the iconography, which is everywhere.  You have to decode some cards and symbols just to play.

Egy aránylag egyszerű, relatíve gyors, épphogynem filler játék.
Érdekes az 7wonders jellegű akcióválasztás, bár az nem tetszett, hogy semmilyen kapcsolatban se vagyunk a tőlünk háromra, négyre ülőkkel.
Feldhez hűen elég száraz a játék, nem sok tematikát érzek mechanizmusok mögött. Ilyen szempontból kivételt jelentenek a patkányok, talán ezért is tetszett az a rész a legjobban a játékban.
Nem menekülök el, ha valaki játszani akar vele, de nem is én fogom kezdeményezni.

RATING: 7
A suprisingly deep game for the short time it takes to play it. In part this is the result of the minimal player interaction. Most of the time you can already plan out your actions while everybody else is doing their stuff. While some sort of long-term strategy probably doesn't hurt the game is primarily about maximising gains with whatever hand of cards you get at the beginning of a turn. There are various means to turn those actions into prestige points, and the game needs them for the card drafting to work. Even so, the decision which card to keep and possibly play yourself is often fairly obvious. In short, a quick, light, inoffensive design that looks more complicated than it is.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Another solid and enjoyable game by Stefan Feld. Nice balance between collection of prestige points and management of rats plague, which takes away points and influence. 

Easier to play than other Feld games such as Die Burger von Burgund or Macao, but anyway it’s nice and meaty enough to the average eurogamer.

Notre Dame is the first Feld game I ever played. I think it's pretty neat!  Straightforward game (especially compared to his games of the last 10 years).  Lots of tough decisions to make, as there are lots of things you want to do and only a precious few actions you are allowed to take. Everything feels fluid, and I like the minimal luck factor involved but there's just enough luck with the card draws that the tension is heightened. It is mainly MPS and things never really feel tense between players. It is basically a "gain as many VPs as you can" sort of game, and the brain burn can feel a little crunchy at times. Still, it is a smart game, easy to learn, and one that could be enjoyed multiple times with the inclusion of the additional Person cards. It can feel a little punishing at times though and can leave you groggy by the end of the experience!  But that aside, it's still a signature Feld game.  Plus, the art design is really nice and the board configuration is unique!  All in all, this is a Feld classic!

Solid game with elegant mechanism, everything nicely fitting together. But there is a near total lack of player interaction (which probably is the reason for its popularity). There is nothing you can do about someone else seeming to be winning. At the same time every action will somehow result in victory points for a player, I do not see clear possibilitites for strategy.

RATING: 6
A much simpler game than I imagined it to be.  Not much interaction...akin to Puerto Rico in many ways.  The plague absolutely killed me.  Many decisions to make, but few turns to take.  I can see it playing very quickly after a few times through.

After a second game, I'm not sure what to think of it.  I won in a very close 5-player game, but I feel like the theme doesn't make much sense to me.  I'm running around getting money and victory points?  

This feels like it is a very "Euro-type game".  This isn't to say I didn't have fun.  It was definitely fun - I just don't know if I think it's a good game.

This is a very well designed game that I enjoyed quite a bit. Nice components, multiple paths to victory, lots of things to balance and some very nice mechanics.

Do note: It will take several plays to learn the capabilities of all the buildings and people that you can hire and I can see it getting a bit tiresome having to constantly look at the cheat sheets every move, but other than that minor flaw its a great game. If you give it the chance and play it a few times to get a feel for things and to learn the capabilities of the game. You are sure to appreciate all the thinking that must have taken place to develop this game and to have fun doing so.

This is one that takes a little time to appreciate for some, so if you don't have the time or patience to play through it a few times you may not like it. I however think it is a masterpiece of a game and am glad to have finally been able to get a copy and play it.

Many thanks to the Basement Boardgamer video review of this game here in the forums. I probably would not of bought this game until I played it or saw a video review of it first. These video reviews are a huge help when deciding on whether to buy a game or not.

First reaction: I really like the design... it has some of the same kind of feel as Pillars of the Earth, but I don't feel as out of control.

Amazingly, my 6 year old son is able to play 2 player at a competitive level - he lost to me by 3 prestige points!

UPDATE: the third game felt pretty much the same as the first two games... which doesn't bode well for long-term play. Nothing wrong with the game, mind you - just not a lot of surprises here.

Somewhat dry, even for a Feld.  Drafting/action selection, extra actions/persons purchasing were enjoyable and mildly tense with the staving off of the plague.

Felt like pure vp conversion.  Doesn't really feel like you are accomplishing anything nor does it feel like a full game.  Instead, it feels like only part of what could have been a really good game.

I like that the cubes increase the value of the actions and the varied ways in which you can pursue vp.  The carriage action, the plague even(though I am not a fan),
all could have been a part of something more whole than this.  The ratings here are overwhelmingly good.  Maybe I am missing something or playing it wrong?

Solid game from Alea.  I like the modular board setup.  Although there seems to be little player interaction you do need to be watching what the person downstream from you is doing and modifying your passes accordingly.  Plenty of strategies seem to work - building Notre Dame seems important, as do rats, but the winner of our last game ignored both.

Classic pastel euro - select actions from a limited set, get resources from a limited poole and convert to VP, build and improve your VP engine. Your actions are somewhat dependant on the luck of the draw so not perfect information in this one which adds a bit of variety and risk management.

An example of a well done and well tested eurogame, somewhat dry in theme but works flawlessly, Notre Dame looks nice, plays nice and is easy to explain and is not language dependent. Some people say that it has no theme, but I couldnt care less, is just an easy euro with neat mechanics like the card drafting and nice bits. Scales really good and I think that is an excellent option for non gamers as well as for gamers looking for a fast competitive and interactive game. It is a clean game in which the smart play is rewarded. When playing it just forget about the lacking theme and enjoy the wonderful and very original card management and switching hand rules.

Opinion: for me this is one of the best Felds games. Escalates very well no matter the number of players, and the duration of each game is adequate and short for the depth the game has. Make a draft with your cards (having 9 each round, but in a random order) and place your cubes in your board. No much direct interaction during the game (except for Notre Dame and the carriage). The tension with the rats makes the game something lovely, take care of them, but enough for not being down in the rest of options you have

RATING: 5
Yet another of those sandbox/optimization games that the European publishers can't seem to get away from these days.  Figure out the most efficient way to build up your little kingdom, then amaze the n00bs with your skillz.  Eh, it's not bad.  There's a decent amount of subtlety for a 45 minute game.  But it's a bit dull and feels claustrophobic.  Nothing unexpected or dramatic is ever going to happen in this game, which means it will lack replay value for me.  Also, the component quality sucks, even for alea (the worst of the major German publishers for materials quality).  You will probably like Notre Dame if you're a big fan of games like Caylus, San Juan, Yspahan, St. Petersburg, Pillars of the Earth, Puerto Rico, and Leonardo da Vinci.

Notre Dame is all about balance. You need to balance money and points and cubes and rats in order to win. Of course, part of that balance is knowing when to sacrifice as well.

It is also a game where the other player's will decide what you can and cannot have.

RATING: 9
I don't count myself as a Stefan Feld fan, but this might be the game to convert me. This isn't a point salad, but like some of his other games, you are pulled in all different directions and have to make tough decisions about what you will do. This is made even tougher because of the card draft: you will see only three players' cards over the course of the game. You always get first choice from your cards, but you get increasingly worse leftovers from the other players, and you will take only two actions per round. Add to this a plague that you have to manage, and the game is quite simply excruciating, but in the best way. Very excited to play this some more. It's short and great.

One of my absolute favorites. Another well designed Euro by Stephen Feld.

I was captivated with Notre Dame from the outset. It has a beautiful geometric design that changes with the number of players. The playerboards themselves function as the game board and the information they contain about players' strategies and positions is easy to glean at a glance.

Card drafting is the central mechanic. In normal Feld fashion, much work has to be done throughout the game to avert complete disaster. Every turn you feel like you need to do 4 different things to keep from moving backwards. However, you get to do two, and that is only if you choose wisely during the card drafting phase (which functions as your action selection). The player who manages to stave off the Bubonic Plague long enough to earn victory points will win. You must try hard to play ND well. I enjoy that challenge each game.

This is a meaty game for being so quick. While there isn't that much interaction, the interaction in the game is interesting as you try to guess what you are going to get. It's more about building your production machine. Since you can't know what you are getting, it's usually best not to put all eggs in one basket, but doesn’t spread too thin either. 

The game works great with 3-5 players. I haven’t tried the two player version though.

This is the fastest and probably the easiest to grasp of Feld's game and i love it for that.

RATING: 7
Two plays, once with four and once with five. Fun little game that generates a lot of tricky decisions and which lets you choose from a variety of possible strategies (in other words, a typical Alea game). It's also one of those games where, for every thing you accomplish, there's something else you were forced to ignore, and so the trick is deciding which course of action brings the most profit for the least amount of pain. The down side is that there's not a lot of player interaction; you do have to be aware of what the person on your left is doing, and it's helpful to keep track of what cards the people to your right have gone through, but you're not really engaging with other people's personalities.

"Typical" resource driven Euro where you don't have enough actions to do all you want in a turn. The drafting mechanic sets this one somewhat apart from the run of the mill.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.33
After all the great buzz this game got I had to try it myself (prelimenary rating after one 5 player game). To make it short: it left me lukewarm. A lot of people praised that the theme is not superficial but I found a lot of actions being mechanics without an actual connection to the building you use or the person you bribe. Multiple paths to victory: maybe, if have lucky card draws. But you only may play two of three cards each round so that there are not many options to choose from. Basicly you decide which card [i]not[/i] to play of those you have (while 2 cards are received by your neighbour).
Therefore it's a light game but still too convoluted for what it is: a typical Eurogame with poor interaction which American style gamers are fed up with.
Furthermore the cardboard is too thin so that it begins to warp after 5mins putting out of the box.
Rating after two plays (4/5 Player); I am willing to play again and rating may change, but not much. I am still waiting for Alea to be back with a great gamers game.

I liked it, but several things about it annoyed me. The game itself is pretty simple, but it seemed like it was made more complex by continuing to pile on mechanisms. It was as if someone brought out a simple game, but they continued to tack on additional mechanisms so that it didn't seem simple, or so that it had additional chrome. The scores were very close at the end, however, and I'd definitely like to give it another try before passing final judgment. *UPDATE* After another play, I've decided it just isn't for me. It's mostly just optimization of resources, with no real long-term planning. Again, it felt like just a collection of mechanisms, without any real story arc.

It's quick, accessible, and seems to genuinely allow for many paths to victory.

Coming from MtG background I can fully appreciate the subtle interaction resulting from the drafting mechanism. If you don't pay attention to your "Daddy's" board, you won't know what you should be doing your self. It's a bit abstract and somewhat dry cube-pushing eurobreed game in it's heart. But it does that very well and doesn't outstay it's welcome. Games feel nicely different depending on the order of the scoring cards. Good, solid game, that I'll always play.

I see it's familial to Louis XIV. But while Louis didn't get me in any way, ND is a joy to play. It is unbelievable that a card driven majority game can still excite me that much.

It's not that I can tell: "I won because..."/"I lost because..." - but I still realize, that passing this card now was a mistake. So it is full of interesting decisions - plays fast (3-player was about 60/ 2-player about 30 minutes each) - is a blast. What else do we want?

There are a lot of different choices you can make here, and the randomness in the cards ensures you will have to adapt your strategy each time. I liked the balance of strategy and chance here. Thematically, it never really got going for me though. A lot of cube-pushing, but for so rich a setting, I would have thought it could have been a bit more engrained in the mechanics. Still, a nicely crafted game, and one I would be happy to play again.

RATING: 9
Terrific game, easily one of Feld's best. You only get 18 regular actions and 9 hires in the whole game, so you need to make every move count. Definitely best with 3. Very clean and well thought-out. Only reason I'm not giving it a 10 right now is because with 4 or 5 players you don't actually see a card from everyone, which isn't quite as enjoyable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Reminds me a lot of Puerto Rico.  There seems to be a lot of potential paths to victory but you must adapt on the fly based on what cards you draw (and when you draw them) and what cards are passed to you.  There isn't as much randomness in the game as it might seem on your first play; the game also provides many ways to mitigate bad luck.  The player interaction is subtle, yet very important, as you can deny certain cards to your left-hand opponents but must also adapt to being denied cards yourself by your right-hand opponents.I haven't been this excited to play a game repeatedly in many months.
Updated 8/15/07 -- I'll bump this up to a 10.  I've played it close to 20 times now and I can confirm it's very much my kind of game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Fairly easy to explain, and works well with 2-5 players.  Balance is important -- don't want to run out of money else you can't hire at the end of the turn or contribute to Notre Dame; probably not good to run out of markers in your local supply; probably want to pick up some messages to stop other players from getting them; definitely want some markers in the park to increase your score on each scoring play.  Interesting card passing mechanic -- you can choose a card to use yourself, or just to keep it from your left-hand neighbour.  Common dilemma:  should you keep a card that is useless to you just to stop your neighbour from getting it?

Plays quickly -- easily 60 minutes including explanations, but maybe as little as 30 mins for experienced players in a 3-player game.

One important thing to keep track of is rats:

In the 3 A turns: 12 rats (average of 4 rats/turn)
In the 3 B turns: 13 rats (average of 4.33 rats/turn)
In the 3 C turns: 12 rats (average of 4 rats/turn)

The total is 37 rats, less the 9 spaces that you have on your rat track (in the harbour).  That means that during the game, you have to kill or prevent 28 rats to not get plague penalties.  Now, it's not terrible to get penalized (lose 2 points and lose an influence marker from the most populated borough on your board), but losing too many pieces that way can cost you the game.

If you see a 7- or 8-rat turn, you might consider maxing out and taking the penalty -- or taking the doctor (if available), which zeroes out all the new rats but still lets you use the hospital to decrease on the rat track.  If the doctor is worth 7 rats, that's only 21 more you have to kill in the rest of the game, which could be done with 3 gradually-placed markers in the hospital.  (Of course, the heavy-rat turns are what kill you in the plague aspect of this game.)

There are so many different actions to make in the game, ways to strengthen your position in the game, and lots of different ways to win; however there must be a good balance. You can't focus on just gaining followers and money. You must also avoid the plague and donate to the church. No action is more important then the other. Once you over estimate one choice, your opponent can runaway with points by utilizing carriage movement.

An awesome little card drafting game, even on 1 solo play (4-hand).

It's clear that familiarity with cards, timing and opportunities help build bigger scores, but my winning hand 1st time was still over 60 points.

Familiarity will also help speed play a good deal (that and having people draft simultaneously/plan plays at the same time.

I wanted to like this game more than I do.  I think it's a good game, maybe even a very good game, but after all the glowing reviews I was expecting a little more.

I think its appeal will quickly wear off, but it has the potential to be one of those games that you would want to revisit once or twice a year.

That said, I can still recommend it to anyone enjoying card drafting in games (which I do).  That, and rat killing.

It has some mechanics from area majority games, while at the same time not being an area majority game at all! Linking research and action taking is a great idea that I think we'll see repeated in the future.

After a few plays, the game still feels solid, if a little dependent on the whims of the player to your right. The fact that there's a drafting element makes sure that this 'right player dominance' is not quite as pronounced as in Medina, Samurai, or Puerto Rico, making the game easier to play with different skill levels.

This is a good game, but man... I hate it, because I have yet to do well at it. I always feel miserable afterwards, such that I want to smash some dishes or something. I'm thus not inclined to expand any further other than to say it is a good game, with agonizing choices, and multiple paths to victory. Initial rating: "8".

Update (11/13/10) 6 plays: After playing a number of games from the dark ages, dealing with themes that deal with plague, rats, pollution, starvation, and graves, I like this one the best, when compared to World Without End, Antiquity, and Agricola. Still can't win, though.

Update (02/11/10): With Hansa Teutonica out there, why should I ever play this again? Dropping to a "6".

Update (01/31/2014) 8 plays: Took over three years to bring this back to the table. I am reminded why I do not like this game. It is very unforgiving, chaotic, and punitive. I made a "small" mistake of running out of money in the first period, and after that suffered for the rest of the game. Stephen Feld has been derided for his "point salad" designs, and this is another example. It seems his design philosophy is introduce a massive amount of chaos at the players, either through dice (Castles of Burgundy) or pass-the-trash card drafting of Notre Dame, and then giving the players a huge menu of choices for VPs. The mechanisms seem like they are pasted on after the mechanisms have been developed, so I spend half the game wondering why what the significance of "this" action versus "that". In the end, it is all about maximizing VPs, and the theme really is irrelevant.

Like Puerto Rico, money is very important early on in the game, and then players need to convert their engine over to generating VPs later in the game. Trying the keep the rats infestation down is important, but it shouldn't be the sole focus. There are a number of things players want to do, and not enough actions to do them, in typical Euro fashion. I was very frustrated at the end of this game. The others suspected that it would be several more years before this hit the table again. They may be right.

Update (02/02/2014) 9 plays: After cooling down for a day, I requested this game back to the table. Focusing on leveraging the cards given to me, I was able to pull off a significant win. I did not worry too much about the rats, as I had in past games, allowing the rats to get to max, and then keeping it there. In one instance, we were all blown out of the water with seven rats in one turn, but losing 2 VP and a cube didn't seem like a big deal. I am beginning to appreciate the game design, now that I am beginning to understand Feld's thinking. His games are swirling chaos of randomness, and one just needs to accept that. Within that swirl, the player that can maximize leverage on VP generation will do well. It also helps to know what cards are available, and what cards are coming up. I will up this up to a tentative "7". I'm still cautious of Feld's designs, but may end up liking some of his games.

Update (02/14/2014) 10 plays: Won again, by completely ignoring the hospital and the plague. Concentrated on generating cubes and moving the caravan around to gather up all of the chits, which would eventually turn into 6-9 VP later for one of the bonus cards. Was hit with the plague 5-6 times, but still won with a margin of 5-6 VP, which tells me that the hospital is overrated. However, these games were where the doctor bonus card came out on the first round, rendering the hospital strategy useless--there is a bonus card which benefits the player who manages to keep the rats under control. Knowing what the future bonus cards are, and playing specifically towards one (or two) of them could be the margin for victory. On an unrelated note, the rotating player boroughs, oriented specifically for a given number of players, is pure design genius.

Simple card drafting game.

The board is unique in that it is like individual player boards that "interlock" seamlessly based on the player count (3-5).

There is one space that seems kind of weird--the space where you only get one thing for playing there, not # of things equal to # of cubes there (like all the other spaces). I understand why the space is there--it's a general get-one-of-whatever space, but having the effect of "if you have 4[?] cubes there, you can get the benefit of that space twice" is strange because it actually makes the space sound like it should be valuable or attractive when it still is a bad deal. Sometimes confuses new players. I try to stress that it is [generally] the worst space on the board.

Oh and rats! I mean, keep the rats away. Rats!

Mechanically this is about as simple as a Eurogame can get: place a cube and get the corresponding benefit. It's interesting in that you're perpetually short of both cubes and cash, and have to generate more while optimising your play. It's pretty much themeless and the card-passing mechanism can hand the game to an opponent if you're careless about what you pass on. I'm sure I'll play it regularly, but it's dry, dry, dry.

RATING: 9
The first thing to understand is that this is really a card game in disguise.  Then: Presents many options, plays quickly, and finds really interesting (but subtle) ways to provide player interaction. There are many clever things about this game--the limited nature of cubes, the way Notre Dame works, the importance of the card passing, the additive nature of the districts... I like it a lot.

Update: When I finally win a game, I am often tempted to revise its rating downward.  In the case of Notre Dame, I raised it, because there are so many interesting things going on in this game and even though I won decisively, there were a couple of decisions that I had seriously considered making differently.

Further update: DO NOT underestimate the importance of the cards you pass your opponents! Notre Dame puts their fate in your hands in a way that few board games (as opposed to card games) do.

First played July 18th, 2007.  This one will take a game play or two to figure out.  There are so many options for points in this game.  It takes 10  minutes to have the rules taught to you.  The game itself takes about an hour for three players.  There seems to be a good mix of strategy and luck in this one.  You could definately do analysis paralisis in this one.  I'd recommend giving this a couple of game plays.  One to figure out how to play and then another to see if you really like it.  If you like it, it would be a good canidate for a slot in your rotation of games to play.  If you don't like to have a lot of options this is not for you.

RATING: 8
Traded Cuba for this (and well worth it).  Good strategic game that is simple (play two actions) with the game over in 9 turns.  Plays fairly fast (about an hour) with a light burn when it comes down to crunching maximum point gain through your very limited action choices.  Randomness with card drafting takes away the threat of repetition and gives it a much greater level of replay.

Even after reading the rules I wasn't expecting such an enjoyable experience.  I actually played it back to back in my fist sitting (very high praise).  It also at least *appears* there really are multiple strategies to employ.

The amazingly short play time and quick decision process makes for a great game environment.  The cute modular board is very neat too.

Maybe I need a few more plays but I wasn't taken by it.  The Rat mechanic is rubbish, the fact that all the players can choose the same card at the end of each era takes all the strategy out of it, and the car mechanic seems tacked on.  Also seemed to me after several plays the 'killer' tactic would fall out, and sort of spoil it.

Played with 2, 3 and 5 players. Notre Dame pushes all the right buttons in terms of game mechanics; it delivers a mid-weight dose of resource management within a manageable time frame. It work wells with 2 players which is a bonus for a multiplayer game. However, it is a disappointment in terms of theme. At no point in the game do I feel that I am managing a city quarter, let alone one in Paris. Apart from the box cover art and the Notre Dame tiles there is very little to associate this game with Paris; indeed the board artwork could be of a German city. The board tesselation is cool but pointless (its only serves to allow coach movement between city quarters - a mechanic that itself feels tacked on). And the wooden components are dull: the hatted figure from so many other games (Princes of Florence, San Marco...), a coach that looks like a police car and lots of small cubes. UDPATE: after a few plays my opinion of the game has become more positive. It also works well with 5 players, especially as the playing time is no more than 1.5 hours.

This game fits in well with the Alae brand of games.  While it was completely different, I was reminded of Puerto Rico throughout the game.  for me however that was not a good thing.  This game just didn't grab me like others have.  

It is a decent game, but I felt like I was constantly having to react to my previous turn.  For example, on one turn I would get cards that would have nothing to do with either my current plans or did not help me at all.  Then I would have to spend my next turn merely correcting what happened on the previous turn.  I would try this one again to see if maybe I just had bad luck, but I have no plans to purchase this one now.

RATING: 7.5
4 plays - 3 FTF, 3,4 & 5 players

A pretty good one hour middle-weight on par with Louis and Mykerinos, slightly similiar in play as it is a placement game with very limited actions but people are not competing in the same areas as you which makes a big difference interaction-wise, there is some but it is limited to the carriage items up for grabs, Notre Dame and the card drafting. It is interesting and excellent that you are playing against the other players AND the game itself re the Rats and the card draw.

A good dose of luck in the card draw but just about right for the game length and weight(1 hour), sometimes you pick up 3 good cards of your 9 all at once and you are forced to pass 2 which does suck, if your opponents don't share this same fate then they pass you scraps but it seems to go around fairly evenly. The card drafting is similar to Midguard, start with some cards, grab one and pass them to the left etc and had the same negative aspect where you see the same junk being passed around, it seems too samey as well as the same cards just keep getting re-hashed (also like Midguard) but it works for the most part.  

We did think the Inn was very weak in our games and no one used it akin to the University in PR and could probably use tweaking. On the other hand the Park seems pretty strong giving 1 extra bonus VP every time you get points to the point if someone has it, you better too. Other than this everything looks very balanced and you need to play a pretty balanced game to win managing the Rats, scooping things up with your carriage, keeping money coming in, keeping cubes coming in, and being able to capitalize on bonus points where possible all while having somewhat of a strategy as well which makes this enjoyable to play. It can also be a very tight and unforgiving game but that's part of it's charm.

Not too heavy on strategy or deep but a good multiple path middleweight with a fast pace that comes in at around an hour so a good game to keep around, I do suspect my rating could fall a little over time. It will take at least one game for most to get a grasp of strategy and 3 players might be best (fastest and most control)although 4 and 5 was also quite good and I really want to try 2. I do find I get the same kind of feeling/satisfaction as Caylus (Dry theme, worker placement, buying favours) only this has the luck factor albeit it is also a much shorter game 

[u]UPDATE[/u]: 8 => 7.5  Still a very nice and fairly meaty one hour game, I love the tightness of the cubes, money and the rats but I hate the luck of the draw that can happen especially if you get all three of your good cards in one draw or not getting a money card when you really need it.  Now that I have played in the Year of the Dragon lowering my rating was an easier decision (only a little) and I question whether or not I will keep this after owning ITYOTD, they do scratch the same itch. 

[u]UPDATE[/u]: Still keeping this after many many plays of both, quite similiar but both good in their own way

Card drafting game with an engine building aspect that rewards you with more goodies the more you invest in it. For a Feld game the rules are quite light and very streamlined. The rats is the biggest annoyance in the game but it also presents itself as a strategy. If you generate more points than you lose, you could potentially just ignore those pesky rats. The game is not as good as the other Felds but I'll play it once in a while if we don't have enough time for a longer game.

Very fun short game!  You're always having to balance the need for several different things (money, influence, points, rat control) and yet it's light enough to avoid AP.  I always enjoy playing it and it is quick to teach too.  It makes for a nice filler.  I couldn't imagine playing it more than once a session though as there isn't enough variety or theme in it nor is there enough potential for creative strategies to fascinate me, hence a rating of 8.

Rated after a single two-player game.  An interesting game, with lots of options flying around.

Initial impression. Takes heavy-weight German-style games to the extremes: Very abstract, processual, takes player interaction to a new low, and really feels more like so many solitaire optimization puzzles than a real multiplayer game. It also feels very derivative, and almost every mechanic made me think "I've seen this before"! Mechanically, it seems to work well, and it's very much a strategic brainburner. Still, I didn't care much for it. Place influence cubes in order to earn money and prestige points? Yawn.

Initial Rating : 5.0 (July 2011)

I just found out that my first Notre Dame game had a BIG rules error, when the rats hit the 9 space, we moved them to the 1 space making the game boring and without tension, however with the correct set of rules this is a very tight game with very hard decisions, a winner in my book. It went from a 5.0 rating to a 8.0 and become my second favorite Feld behind In the Year of the Dragon.

The theme is a little boring but the tactical gameplay is excellent, it has a relatively short playtime but it is a delight to play. Stefan Feld always deliver innovative games (although I don’t love all his games).

For now I prefer to play it with 4 players and I want to play it again soon.

After more plays of Notre Dame and in the Year of the Dragon, I can say that now I prefer In the Year of the Dragon, however in the last couple of years Feld has designed lots of fun games (I have yet to play Aquasphere and La Isla) and I enjoy most of them, so I must name myself a Feld fan.

I continue to like Notre Dame, it has easy rules but the decisions are far from obvious. There is some luck with the order of the cards (the ones you draw and the personalities) but it is a more forgiving game than In the Year of the Dragon. Due to this, it is perfect to introduce to new gamers. Love the draft and majorities mechanics and it plays very fast. Without the rats the game would be garbage, but the rats increase the tension during the game making it a solid design.

Bottom line, a good drafting game I’m usually willing to play.

RATING: 8
My favorite game in the 45-75 min time slot.  A little solitairish, but for a game of that length I'm okay with that.  Very tactical.

In the pursuit of points there are three major resources to manage:  gold, influence cubes, and rats.  Rats do not seem to have an exact 1:1 equivalence with gold and cubes but shift in value as the game situation changes.  That small mechanical tweak on an exact equivalence rescues the resource management portion of the game from staleness.

The variable powers of the personages, the give-and-take of the cathedral card, and the drafting are other appealing aspects of the game which raise it from "just another Euro" into something resembling greatness, or at least extreme goodness.

I tend to play Notre Dame in bursts, about 6-7 games in a month or two before shelving it for a few months.  It might not stay fresh for me without the breaks.

Believe it or not, my first play of this game happened on Nov 3rd, 2008! 

It's been in the groups forever, but I hadn't been able to get in on a game before hand. I was always in a different game when another table fired it up.

So, after finally being able to exhale and savor the play I can say this:
 
 -- It played very smooth and I enjoyed it.

I liked the trading mechanism...really, card drafting mechanism (here are 3 cards, choose one and pass the others on, now here are 2 other cards from the player on your right; choose 1 and pass the other on).

I'm not sure how the game will hold up long term, but I can't judge it without playing it some more--and I'm willing to play it again to find out. 

My initial misgivings on the long term play is that it will feel...processional or like you can just kind of cost along in play.

I put in a good showing, but not great. I was running a very strong VP ([b]V[/b]ictory [b]P[/b]oint) engine by the end of the game; it was chugging away and I was making up ground at a great clip--time just ran out.

The main Achilles's heel for me in this session was missing out on a couple of bribing rounds, but such were the cards that kept me from getting gold a couple of times. 

One other thought on my first play learning: I did have the rats under great control by the end game rounds. This allowed me a [b]very[/b] free range of play, but on reflection, it also hampered me getting it in place. I should have rode the edge of the rats a bit more.

On the whole, it seems to be a pretty good game. I did enjoy it.

Painstakingly detailed, lovingly reverential homage to medieval ecclesiastic architecture. Aw, just kidding folks, it's another generic cube shuffler, with a drawing of a church on the box.

In this one you're shuffling cubes to score points, get money, and get more cubes. You use the money to trigger card effects to score points, get money, and get more cubes. Most efficient shuffling wins.

While the card passing introduces some element of player interaction, there's nothing here I haven't seen a dozen times before. 

Maybe I'm just getting very jaded about this sort of thing. Maybe I need to take up a new hobby.

I've owned this for years and finally got it to the table.  It certainly still holds up...while I probably enjoy Castles of Burgundy more this is more accessible.  The playing time with instruction ran right around 75 minutes.  A three player game with those who know it could be played in 45 minutes. This game packs a lot of punch for that amount of time.  

My biggest concern for this game is how I'll feel about it in 10 plus plays.  Fortunately, I own the Alea treasure chest so the expansion may add to replayability.  I'll reevaluate this in the future but I see this hitting several times over the next few months.

Buy this game if your group likes a bit of punch in a short period of time.  While it's nothing like Glen More it's comparable in weight and playing time.  If you've played newer Feld titles and are wanting to try more games by him you may want to try this before you buy it.  It's in the same vein but is lighter and has less choices.

I like luck elements in games.  I enjoy a game where a player never feels that he cannot win... right down to the final turns.

Notre Dame is such a game.  Random draws from your action stack will determine your strategies for the entire game.  This luck factor is mitigated somewhat by the passing of the cards, but your initial 3 card draw will determine your destiny.

Considering the alea 'big box' line, I'd place Notre Dame squarely in the middle.  After last year's 'Rum & Pirates,' which I enjoyed immensely, this was a bit of a let down.  However, it will definitely be played more at the Club.

It still rates an easy '7' from me.

Great game.  Like the card passing mechanic, fits well in the way this game plays out.  Many things going on here, very tough choices to make to maintain your section of the city.  Do I protect against rats at the hospital, or at the park, do I get prestige points or do I get gold.  There are seven different sections of your portion of the city and it is very difficult to determine what you want to do, and plan for phase 5 when the rats come running in.  AAAAHHHHHH!!!!!!

Played 2-player.  Expect this game will be much better with 3-5.  Enjoyed the resource management aspects, but haven't yet figured out how to manage rats without getting screwed: I'm either losing too much influence due to the plague or I'm spending too much influence reducing rattiness.  Tricky bits are getting enough money and getting enough cubes while still spending on the stuff that will actually net you VPs.  Look forward to playing this with more folks around the table.  It's not PR, but it's faster-playing and much lower-stress!

2014-11-08 - I can understand why Notre Dame is a grail game for so many people. It's on the lighter side of the Feld games, but it has a lot of tough decisions. The drafting at the start of each round doesn't drag like it does in many games. Money and influence are tight; you aren't going to get to do everything you want.

Interesting theme here...not many games featuring rat-borne plague that I've ever heard of. Sadly this game is really, really dry and amounts to little more than futzing about with influence cubes. It's in the top 100, something I find utterly inexplicable. 

I have so many plays of a game I don't find all that interesting because it appeared on BSW and other players were plentiful. Yes, I count my plays there--deal.

After reading the rules of this game I was skeptical about it. However, after playing multiple times I have become quite enamored by Notre Dame. The simplicity of the game mechanics and pacing help to keep the game enjoyable. The card passing mechanic while simple can at times bring about some tough choices as you have to weigh the value of the card you're keeping vs the ones you're giving away.

Getting introduced to Notre Dame now feels a bit like stepping through a time machine to a different era in board games. No doubt, it is a well-designed game. Each round starts with a short bit of card drafting and then two cards are played for actions with a third action available for purchase from three personage cards that are changed every round. Most actions involve placing influence cubes in your borough to get points, more cubes, money, or to control the negative effects of the plague. At the end of each round, players increase their plague track by the number of rats on all of the displayed personage cards. If you have to extend off the end of the track, you lose points and an already placed cube. Most points after 9 rounds wins.

The game is about controlling the flow of cubes and money in order to generate points and plague protection. While a pass 'n draft card mechanic probably felt fresh 4 years prior to the publication of 7 Wonders, it feels anything but today. (Fairy Tale, I think, was the first game to introduce this mechanic and was published two years prior to Notre Dame.) Keeping a consistent flow of cubes and money and controlling the constant pressure of the plague is challenging to be sure, but I feel like this game has been surpassed in ingenuity in the last 10 years and it lacks the interactivity that generally keeps me interested in some of the older designs. Good, but it doesn't feel special enough to set it apart today.

Rating based on 3-4 plays.   While many others are raving about this game, I guess I just don't see it.

Not a "must buy" for me; have no great desire to play it much more to "see what I have missed."

Straight from Planet Euro, Notre Dame is an tightly designed game with plenty of mechanics and almost zero theme.

This was one of my first games since joining BGG. 

One thing that distinguishes ND is the depth/pace ratio. It plays fast. It also gives you several  long-term options for developing your board (score points), but the fact that you're passing cards and responding to fluctuations in the plague provides some good short term decisions. Not a forgiving game for newer gamers.

Essentially, the game gives you six areas to develop that provide incrementally better advantages each time you build them up. For example, the first time you develop your banks, you will receive a payout of one gold. Second time: two gold. Etc. The game also gives you limited room to shift investments. For example, three times in the game, you'll have the opportunity to downgrade one area and upgrade another, receiving the new benefit in the process. Three other times in the game, you'll have the opportunity to shift a big chunk of your investment without receiving the benefit. Say, for example, you're rushed the bank development early and are flush with cash for the remainder of the game. You can pull the plug and reinvest in the residential district, setting you up for major gains later. The particular mode of specialization, both in overall strategy and in mid-game shifts, separates Notre Dame from the pack. But I do think it becomes well worn after a while (~20 plays). 

Update: With experience, this really needs to be a brisk, 45-60 minute game. And even at that weight, I'm convinced that Vikings blows it out of the water.

It's true.  The more you play it, the more you see what the game has to offer.  In some ways it is a straightforward economic system - the more you invest in an area, the more it becomes worth to you.  However, choices regarding the short supply of cubes which help to enhance the value of an action, along with the card-passing mechanism in which your fate is somewhat controlled by others, makes this a game which requires a challenging mix of planning and adaptation.

RATING: 9.5
It's hard to believe there was a time I wanted to trade this away.  This is clearly more and more becoming one of my favorite games.  Quick play time, very satisfying tactical and strategic decisions.  I think one of my favorite aspects is the balace between strategy and tactics.  It's somewhat hard for me to describe this balance.  It's not a game where you can have a major over arching strategy like you can in Caylus, at least not to the same magnitude.  However, how you use your cards each round are not purely tactical either, at least not in the immediate sense.  There's almost a hint of deduction in this game, as more cards are revealed you can anticipate what will come up soon, thus it becomes a game of short goals and maximizing your opportunity turn by turn.

Great game but I can't suggest it. There are better games today that play very similarly but have a much better theme. 

I love combining draft and board control mechanics, which this game pulls off very well. In fact, the drafts feel especially good considering how simple and short they are. But the rest of the game feels a bit methodical to me... so I barely rank this a 7 even with the excellent draft phase. Maybe that's just because I'm not a huge fan of worker placement (but even then that mechanic feels pretty straightforward for a worker placement style game)

This game is lighter than I expected. It's nice that it plays quickly and is relatively straightforward. It did underwhelm me. Other than the rats, it didn't have a lot of elements I'm accustomed to with Feld. The central mechanism is a simple card drafting, which in 2007 was far more novel than it is today. I didn't find the game easy to play, but I didn't find the rewarding depth in there either.

A nice, solid game that has yet another boring theme (influence in a European city?  yawn...) but convincing gameplay.  The card drafting is a pretty fresh mechanic for me (never having played CCGs), and the number of choices is very manageable, yet still not easy to figure out.  The quick play time is a huge benefit here.  If multiple strategies end up emerging with further play my rating could go up.

Excellent abstract game by the designer who brought us the overwhelmingly random Rum and Pirates. The rules were not as heavy as I first thought, and the game can be played fairly quickly once players know how.

There's a nice balance between the interaction with other players (cars and Notre Dame) and keeping a players own region free of rats. While the basic symbols were easy to understand, I felt that the other cards needed text on them (Alea helpfully provided a cheat sheet for players to refer to, but some text -- even a name on the card -- would've been brilliant).

One of the better games to have been released from Alea in a while. I'd happily play this again.

I liked the idea to make an action more useful the more you use it. It is very important to have cubes to perform actions - they are obtained with actions. However, it is not enough cubes for all actions, so several times they have to be replaced from other actions. The less such replacements, the better. Another important resource is money. Lack of money lessens the choices, e.g., you cannot employ helpers, which are generally pretty helpful. And finally, it is very important to control the number of rats so that you won't be forced to give away victory points.

Man patiko idėja, kad kuo daugiau kartų veiksmą kartoji, tuo jis tampa naudingesnis. Žaidime labai svarbu nuolat turėti kubelių veiksmams atlikti - jie atsiranda vykdant veiksmus. Bet visiems veiksmams jų neužtenka, taigi kelis kartus juos tenka perstatyti iš vieno veiksmo į kitą. Reikia siekti, kad perstatymų būtų kuo mažiau. Taip pat svarbūs ir pinigai. Jų trūkumas taip pat užveria tam tikras galimybes, pavyzdžiui, samdyti pagalbininkus, kurie dažnai būna gana naudingi. Na ir svarbu nepamiršti kontroliuoti žiurkių, kad nereikėtų atiduoti pergalės taškų.

I see this one as a quite an innovative mix of mechanisms. The game board is somewhat unusual, the draft element is a smooth randomizer, you'll always have to pay attention to the rats so that your other plans won't backfire and the resource management of money and cubes functions nicely as resources tend to be a bit scarce. Drafting element however might shut someone out of money and cubes, although you should prepare yourself for such a possibility in advance. I've played this one with experienced (of this) players and I really can't see the point of the carts in this game. The other problem is that the game quite fast devolves into a meaningless attempting at gathering just victory points instead of building your board position as the game doesn't favor the latter option.

Overall this game is a lot of fun to learn so if I were to limit myself to ten plays it would rate highly indeed. After seven games I am experiencing substantial diminishing returns to my enjoyment though as there does not seem to be enough interaction to give it replayability. The game is solvable I think and that is why my rating is 6 in spite of the fact that I have enjoyed it thus far. I am finding most decisions to be automatic (e.g. I usually pass my cards within one second of looking at them and this has not stopped me from winning most of my games so far). I like the lack of downtime so I think it might fit as a light near-filler. Update: after playing on BSW I realize that I don't understand the game that well as I am losing most of the time. For some reason I am not interested in finding out what the great players there are doing right. The decisions just seem to simple to captivate me.

There are many ways to get victory points and win, and you need to balance other resources besides victory points.

In a way, it's like Puerto Rico.  You need money in order to do things, and you have to take actions in order to get money, but the money is not the end goal.

  There's actually more going on here than in PR.  In adition to getting money, one also has to get the small person-cubes in order to do anything, and also try to keep rats at bay.  

But this is also simpler to grasp, easier to play, and much more fun than Puerto Rico.

I've only played this once.

Well, well, well...
Certainly a winner from Alea, yet again. A couple of bumps in the silver road they travel, but this one again, gets them back on course!
A lot of decisions to be made, alot of different paths to get to the singular goal of most victory points, alot of tight resource situations, whether it be money, influence or plague...
The only reason this will never be a real high scorer (like a 10 or so...) is the soliraire feel.  Not so much a problem for me, but some in my group won't care for it as much, although they appreciate the lovely mechanics and choices to be made.
Also, plays quite quickly, which is always nice to have that balance...

Based on 50+ plays.  ND packs a good deal of strategy into a short time-frame.  The decisions are usually interesting, and there are a number of viable paths to victory.  I just wish the card-drafting offered a little more scope for tactics and strategy, a la Magic drafts.  With only 3 cards, I often feel like the decision is not as agonizing as I might like it to be.  The player interaction is a also bit thin.  Sure, you can counter-draft to hurt the person to your left, but this tactic often shoots you in the foot.  Still, ND is all in all a solid game.

I actually enjoy this game on BSW, unlike most of their 'ports.  I think it's the ridiculously short play time - we're talking a full two-player game in under 10 minutes.  It's the perfect study break.

2017-08-07 - 5 - After more than two years after playing Stefan Feld's game for the first time (Bora Bora) I tried another and I can now tell that I am definitely not a fan of this designer. It's very dry euro with artificial mechanisms not connected to the theme whatsoever. They work of course, but I don't find it enjoyable to explore them. The game is very tight on resources what doesn't bother me too much and have almost non existent interaction, what bothers me much more.

Fast, lots of choices. Balancing progress with fighting the plague. The plague mechanic isn't as aggressive as Year of the Dragon. Not one clear way to win. 

I had a lot of fun playing this. Looking forward to playing this again with a different number of players.

Rated after 10+ plays. Played with 5,4,3 & 2 players. Great game with lots of different ways to gain victory points. Plays very quick, no down-time.

RATING: 6.8
Down graded from an 8.2 after more plays. Just not as deep a puzzle as Feld's other games and lacks variance. Still enjoyable, just not "awesome."

RATING: 9
The Good: A real challenge to balance everything and therefore there were tough decisions every turn. Multiple paths to victory. Seemed shorter than most heavy stragey games. The board and cards all have icons which are very useful. Card artwork was pretty good.

The Bad: Easy for new players to accidentally make game-breaking decisions such as not having enough gold for hiring. The overall board leaves a very bland impression, which is one reason I was not eager to play. That is a shame, because if you look closely, there are some really nice icons, and there is a lot going on. Also, it has the weirdest shaped board that I have ever seen. That would be okay, except that it comes in 4 pieces which you have to then puzzle over how to get it to fit together.

Only one play; four players; finished second place.  This didn't really excite me.  It seemed to be just an exercise in putting wooden cubes on a board.  But it was my first play and it took some time to understand everything that was going on.  Although I'm willing to play it again to give it another try, I find that I'm always opting to play something else instead.

Very fun solitaire, but I want to fling rats at my opponents.

The only influence you have over others is driving the SUV (cart) to steal tiles before others and card drafting that you pass down the table...but most likely you're just dumping the cards you don't want yourself vs. trying to fudge your opponent and the tiles you're just trying to get for yourself first which puts in urgency, not conflict.

Too Euro friendly for me to give it a 9, but overall a great max/min puzzle that scales well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I think Mr. Feld made a lot of good choices in the game design. In a sense, you're pretty much working your own board, so there is little direct conflict, but the card drafting means you have a huge influence on what your opponents can do. Many interesting decisions, few clear ones. Nicely balanced.

Cool mix of different mechanics with a fantastic result.  There's a great balance between strategy and tactics here, which I'm just beginning to scratch the surface of.

Notre Dame hits the "sweet spot" for me as a strategy game.  Not to heavy and not too light, the game is "just right".  Another good design by designer Stephen Feld  who is rapidly becoming one of my favorite game designers.

Building up and trying to avoid the plague.  That is the way things work in Notre Dame.  Choose cards that you draw and from others as you pass choices around and try to gain the most victory points by the end of the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very good low-on-luck resource management game. As such, there are no breathtaking new elements, but the familiar mechanisms have been blended together into a neat design. Build up an economy to produce blocks and money while managing the rats plague and then start collecting victory points. Don't get fixed on any particular one of the different roads to victory, but try to adapt according to the cards you get and the gameplay of the other players (avoid pursuing the same strategy as your righthand neighbour).

If the couple of mechanisms that make the game only 98% multiplayer solitaire instead of 100% one were removed, the game would last about 10 minutes when players could take their actions simultaneously. 10 minute Notre Dame would be ok, now its way too long for a game with so little interaction or interesting decisions.

[2008.Feb.17] Notre Dame by Stefan Feld is the 11th game in the Alea big box game series. This action selection [you choose between 2 of 3 available actions] and resource management [you manage your influence (cubes) and coins] game feels rather lightweight, but is by no means easy. On top of the pressure of always feeling like you never have enough influence and coins, each of the game's nine turns ends with the effects of the dreaded rats. I hope you have invested in your borough's hospital. Beware the plague!

[2016.Feb.2] This doesn't include as much pain in a game box as does [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/31594]In the Year of the Dragon[/url] (another Stefan Feld title), but it still makes players squirm. Darn those plague rats! {grin}

RATING: 4
Typical euro game, you play, the game ends, somebody wins and it's no big deal.

Players makes different action to achieve victory points differently, but in one way or the other, everybody would end up doing the same things but in a different order.

There is some ressemblance with louis XIV especially for the cube management. But I think the problem with notre dame is that you have so much different ways to score that you do not necessarily do it the optimal way. You just fix yourself an objective and try to follow it. But still ending up to do a bit of everything.

So there is simply no excitement to play that game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5

RATING: 8
There's a blending of multiple strategic paths towards victory.  For newbies, I would strongly advise to pay good attention to the 3 bribery roles that come up every round and not to miss any bribery of roles if possible.  For experienced players, it will usually be close games with the card deck randomness and card counting memory of each player determining the outcome of most games.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Solid card drafting game in which you seek to put together the best points generating machine possible.  Seven different areas in your region each do different actions to a quantity dependent on how much influence you have present.  One can also score points by placing influence in Notre Dame itself although a tithe is required.  Money tends to be a bit tight and one must always be aware of the rat problem which can come back to bite you (although its possible to develop a points engine in which you will just not care too much about the rats).  In the card drafting, you take the top 3 cards from your personal stack, pick one, and pass the other two to the next player.  You pick one from the two cards a person passes you and then take the remaining card left over from the third person.  This primarily tactical in that you must always make the best of the situation that presents itself with people giving you cards that may or may not fit into your master plan.  There are times that I feel this game becomes fairly mechanical and almost robotic as usually it is fairly obvious which cards you should or should not play.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I actually rather liked this early Feld game. My wife however didn't like it at all. Much like Macao in a sense, this Feld featurs some interesting card play and the ever present threat of a lack of resources. When playing the game you always feel like you can't do all the things you want to. And to make matters worse there is a rat plague that could cost you dearly if you fail to do something about it. This all results in a very tense and sometimes brainburning game which I liked but after 2 plays was enough for my wife. As of today it is no longer in my collection.

RATING: 8
Very satisfying middle-weight Euro game.  I enjoy the card drafting and like the ways in which the various game mechanisms intertwine to produce interesting decisions.  Maximizing payouts, keeping resouces available and avoiding rat problems all need to be done yet corners must be cut each round.

Enjoyable, with the characters coming in a different order each time, but a bit too light, compared to another relatively short euro like Keyflower.

When played with 2 players, more enjoyable than Caylus Magna Carta, for my wife and I.  There are more things to keep an eye on: the plague, the special characters, the influence, the gold, the places where influence is exerted,...

Also has a slight taste of Caylus Magna Carta: keeping only one card and passing the other two to your neighbor is a variation on worker placement (you can prevent some of your opponents from performing a given action); you need resources in order to develop things (coins, the hospital,...); the possible actions change as the game develops (the special power given by the cards, in Notre Dame).

Nice time length (about the same as Race for the Galaxy, for 2).

Notre Dame is one of these games you don't really mind playing but you'd rather play something else instead.

This one definitely grow on you and I am really starting to like it. Played with the expansion (from Treasure Chest), which actually adds a bit more randomness because you can't ensure that particular cards are coming out.  Not sure whether this is good or not.

Not sure on this one - maybe its because I am rubbish at at.  Still would like some more games to see, but both games I have had weren't all that enjoyable (at least for me).  Possibly it's that you can't hurt the other players at all - its just about maximisation.

Well - another Stefan Feld game (paradoxally I got to know his games only through this year's Im Jahre des Drachen) that I like. At first glance the interaction between the players seems small but then you realize that you have to pass action cards to other players - directly influencing their choices and that's virtually as much interaction in a game as you can wish for. There's a Goa-like feeling to improving your districts and the influence cubes with the division into two supplies remind me of El Grand but that's OK. All in all I am positively surprised by this title especially since I bought it only on the basis of some opinions I've heard.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Unfortunately, the luck factor is just a tad too much for a game of this weight (light-heavyweightish) and complexity,  especially since it undercuts what potentially is some strategically interesting decisions. This is exacerbated by the seeming weak-sister nature of the Inn. Nevertheless, there are several interesting paths to victory, numerous interlocking systems, which in combination are very fresh, and the rat/plague system is, if not unique, certainly different enough to grab your attention, and it also creates a nice tension by providing an interesting variation on the "currency" concept.

The 'wow' factor of the physical design and the excellent scalability pushes Notre Dame over the top to being a buy when it comes out in English.

[It's actually rather tempting to bump it up another point just for the sheer entertainment value of seeing how enthusiastic John Brier has become about ND. Playing the game last night was the online equivalent of seeing a kid bounce up and down in his seat while waiting for a favourite snack :) ]

UPDATE: Yeah, the hyperbole monster bit me. ND is a good design, and I expect to be playing it on Brettspielwelt for a long time to come, but it just doesn't quite match up to the other games in this category. Ra, Saint Petersburg (post-expansion), Blue Moon City, Torres...they are all significantly more elegant and mostly less prone to twists of fate. Drawing your Bank and Seminary together in Section A of the game is a large blow, and drawing one of them with the Hospital is only marginally less annoying. The shattering weakness of the Hotel and the need to commit fully to the Residence in order to make it worthwhile are lesser, but nagging, flaws as well.

Fun, but not a buy.

The biggest downside to this game is that it is language neutral. I'm getting too old for this international-street-sign stuff! It's difficult to read the symbols through the busy graphics on the board. Alas, it's a 'mechanics' game, about nothing at all (see '[i][b]Mechanics In Search Of A Game[/i][/b]'). The game ends after the 9th turn - very exciting.

A very good Stefan Feld game, but one where you are always struggling to keep disaster at bay.  The basic mechanic of the game is card drafting to take a particular action.  You own a district in Paris and you are trying to keep it from the plague while at the same time advancing its prosperity.  If you are not keen on games that on games where you are struggling with very significant "slaps" inflicted on players by the game, this may not be for you. 

I really like the game, but I am Stefan Feld fan.  This is one of his games that is a little divisive where gamers who don't like to live on the cusp of disaster really dislike it. 

It is a medium-weight Euro.  It is not family friendly but very close to be.  If you had teenagers who like Euros, I see this one going over well.

Along with rahdo's video have built up the hang of this. Probably too thinky for me but can see the attraction even if it is too much for me will now play multi player to see how it all works together but it seems largely a solo effort with minimal interaction.

RATING: N/A
See Farid Widjaya's Review: http://vimeo.com/936821

Recommended as a stepping stone game to Caylus.
Perhaps the following in order:

- STONE AGE
- NOTRE DAME (See http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/193778)
- PUERTO RICO
- Pillars of the Earth
- Agricola
- CAYLUS

NB: PILLARS OF THE EARTH (sometimes referred to as Caylus Lite) and AGRICOLA (sometimes referred to as PR Heavy) were also mentioned in other reviews of worker placement and resource management games. The games mentioned above, however, were chosen b/c there seems to be universal appeal and a good balance between light to heavy gaming (as well as shorter to longer playing) as you move up the ladder (i.e., f/SA to Caylus).

NB: Be aware that in using the above games as a stepping stone, that SA and PotE collect resources BUT do not manage them (as does ND, PR and Caylus)

NB: Caylus (unlike the other games) scales down unusually well to a very satisfying 2 player game. Whereas the others seems to be more enjoyable at the 3-4 player mark.

Despite it's high rating, I'm pushing this to a "2 - Love to Have" (vs. 1) since it's game board might not appeal to kids as much. Since we already have PR and Caylus (and SA seems to be a big hit already - in large part due to its fun element and nice looking/feeling theme), it seems that it's worth jumping to PR rather than waiting around until we have a copy of ND. Also, Pillars might be worth getting (and playing) at this juncture (or right after PR) since it also has a beautiful gameboard and theme. And, in a similar vein, it might be worth jumping Agricola (which seems to be a VERY HEAVY version of Stone Age). Therefore, the new path to Caylus might look like this:

- STONE AGE
- PUERTO RICO
- PILLARS OF THE EARTH
- CAYLUS

Save Notre Dame and Agricola for later.
NB: If PR doesn't hit on the first go round, ND may be worth trying (since it has been regarded as a nice "Puerto Rico lite")

RATING: 6
7/2008 A good game.  There's so much to do and so few actions to perform.  One has to plan ahead and focus on some parts of the game.  The game itself very solitare; apart from the carts and the center piece. The carts seems to be added just to make the game less solitare.  Game components are over designed - the game board has so much "design" it's become confusing.

After two playings, I'm really impressed with this one. It's fun, the board is cool, it's not easy managing your resources, and the decisions are tough to make. You play cards to place cubes in your districts to get victory points. However, you better have rat control or you'll lose your stuff. Since you only pick one card from your hand of three and pass the other two along, you have to make the best with what you're given.

RATING: 9
This is an easy-to-play game that combines a number of mechanics, including area control, card drafting, and hand management. The strategy is subtle, but intriguing. The game plays well with seemingly any number of players (2-5), although it seems that specialization is less of an option with two players (not a criticism). Any fan of Euros should enjoy this quite a lot, but it likely won't appeal to others.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Very elegant card drafting + worker placement mechanic, with the possibility of some strong area manipulation using the person cards. This game is a gem in its simplicity and depending how you play it can be either very light or quite thoughtful. 
For sure it has a strong tactical connotation but it can also be strategic since you are aware of which cards will be displayed during each phase and therefore you can plan  powerful combos.
The unpredictable rising of the plague adds some nice tension and will force you to "waste" some point-generating actions to counter its effect; so you can choose whether playing more aggressively, trying to generate points regardless of the plague effect, or more conservatively.

What I really do not like about this game is that the theme really has nothing to do with the play of the game.  And the actions seem disconnected from each other, so I could never figure out how they all connect together.

All I know is that there are lots of rats.  If I wanted to play a game about rats, I would invent a game about being in an exterminator in the sewers of New York City.  Now that would be cool.  But Notre Dame?  The game is somewhat broken, and thematically its a mess.

RATING: 8
The limited actions (18 played cards in total) really limits you (in a good way). Apart from that, you're constantly down on resources (cubes and money). In the midst of that all you're trying to gather as much prestige points as you can.

The concept of taking and passing cards gives options to make the best of your actions and also influence the options for your left neighbor. With less experienced players this can result in a seating order problem, but we didn't have any problems with it.

This is a very typical worker placement game. It's pretty, as are all of Feld's games, but some of the symbols are small and very similar.

A few too many random bits for my liking. 

My second play saw me enter the third round (turn 7) with 2 victory points.  I managed to make another 40 over the last three turns, coming in second place.  Still, a fairly respectable total, even more so considering that I had about as many points as the other three non-winning players combined.

For what it's worth, it's apparently a really bad idea to run out of cubes and money.  One player got sort of stuck in the first few turns after he expended both of those resources.

I enjoy playing it, but I feel like this game may be a bit less balanced than it gives the impression of being.  Though there are several options for actions each turn, at any given moment only one or two of them really make sense for any particular player.  Some of the actions are just fallback options, the lame thing you do when you didn't get the card for the cool thing you really should be doing.  I do like the fact that points are hidden--scoring tracks are just demoralizing.  I like to be able to think I'm winning right up until I don't.  My favorite feature in this game is the rats drawn on the cards to represent the plague.  Really nice art, high production values.

RATING: 5
Randomness of cards can be fun, when you can do some significant action with ANY card. In that case, important is not what I get, but not what I do with it. Then there can be some control. It's not like that in this game. Good action is obvious depending on situation - and what you can do is hoping you get that card or your right person gives it to you. Long-term strategy is just impossible.

Limitation on action does not always make a game tense, sacarcity of resource does not always make a game engaging, abundance of choice does not always make a game interesting. All those character contribute to the dry and frustrating nature of this game.

Thematically pointless, too.

Paris, Paris... Romanticism hidden in the game is magnetizing: Notre Dame, Paris circular rues, markets at the end of quartiers, carriages, rats, epidemics, medics, that's the right setting that make slightly solitaire-style game much more interesting than just moving the pawns here and there. If you seen "Vidocq" you know what's the atmosphere about. If not - go get it. Lots of strategy and adapting here, you depend strongly on your neighbors cards, what makes it unique.

RATING: 8
A fine game. Of course I'm tickled by the physical design that makes the board assemble uniquely for 3, 4, or 5 players. Maybe the best implementation of card drafting as a mechanic in a boardgame so far. (Fairy Tale wasn't bad, but this is tighter.) I think this is a light gamer's game, rather than being a family game. There are quite a few things to keep track of and interlocking mechanisms that keep it from being one I'd pull out with nongamers. But with experienced players it's very good.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A solid 7.5 after only 1 play.  A very clean efficient design, I like the card passing and the tight decisions. The variability of the characters to bribe is also nice.  Fighting back the rats was a nice mechanic as well.  Less convoluted then Pillars, but slightly more dry.  

2nd play: nudge the rating down to a 7.  Not as excited about it anymore and it has been eclipsed by some other games.

A decent filler game.  Plays quickly and light enough that most people can pick it up.  Manage your Paris suburbs and resources while rats attempt to overrun the place.

So far, I really like this game.  I do think it is susceptible to a feeling of frustration if you make mistakes in the beginning because you will feel as if you can never overcome them.  This is not completely true, but it is more true than in later Feld designs.  Still, for the length of play, this is a really good game.  If the game lasted longer, the rating would certainly go down.

RATING: 7
Excellent design work with getting the 3/4/5 variants to slot together. I'm less enamoured with the art style though.

Gameplay is entertaining, but I definitely haven't grasped it yet. I ran out of money, low on cubes... It seems to be about getting as much down as possible, then ramping up the scoring later in the game.

Even just one play (and one in which I was beaten badly) is enough to see that this is a gem of a game: multiple paths to victory, a nice balance of strategy and tactics, a devilish need to balance many concerns, high turn angst (I always wanted to execute all three cards in my hand, not just two), a surprisingly compact play time, great iconography (we rarely needed the people reference sheet after the first half of the game), and an absolutely gorgeous board and components make Notre Dame stand out for me.

Despite not having much in common with In the Year of the Dragon, I can still feel a connection -- and that's a great thing. I love the interplay of the plague mechanic with the other elements, and the important of each element of the game manifested itself clearly as we played.

With a few more plays, I can see my rating going up -- there's a lot under the hood, and a lot of diverse mechanics that don't seem like they'd go together, but do, to take into account. Really, really nifty.

The 'Alea style' in this one is so strong that it can't possibly be mistaken for a game by any other publisher. Sure, it's interesting, but in the end I find it boiling down to the classic "play cards to get cubes on the board to fuel the victory point machine" kind of game. Basically, the game is a somewhat more involved Louis XIV with card drafting thrown in and any other player interaction taken out. It's a 'solitaire' area influence game in the sense that you're constantly trying to optimize the distribution of the cubes in your quarter of the town as required by the specific phase of the game. But the game played very well (as far as I can say after only one play) and was pretty tense and exciting at times.

Wow, my new favorite Feld. Remarkably fast playing, with easy to grasp mechanics. The card drafting not only gives a little player interaction, it also prohibits Analysis Paralysis by allowing players only three actions to choose from. I enjoy the way the boroughs are divided into slices, which also act as roadways for the carriage. And while that's a small thing, i can't help but to be reminiscent of Letters from Whitechapel. I also really enjoy the threat of the rats and how you have to deal with them. Definitely my new go-to Feld game to teach to others, as it has a low barrier of entry, and plays fast.

I'm not a Stefan Feld fan but this is, in my opinion, one of his better games.  I like the card drafting aspect.  Ultimately though, it is just a random collection of mechanisms that you use to put together a point salad.

Played on BSW only so far. So much to keep track of, so many options. Just the kind of tight game I like. Edit: Now played 2x in person. It surprises me how much you feel the threat of the rats - the sensation of looming doom. Enjoy this very much. Plays consistently in under 10 minutes on bsw, which is a sweet spot for me.

Smooth played highly scaleable game of managing your resources and keep up on influence over your opponent. Modular board for different #s of players is great. Components are nice, some luck with card draws, but drafting effects it. Many paths to victory, as in most Feld games. One of my favorites of his designs.

Based off one play.  I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this!  I'm usually nervous about a poor theme, especially when the theme is European history...  BUT this game hooked me quick.  So many options.  A unique feel.  And a tight game.  Loved it.

Update:  Have played this a bunch more.  I quite enjoy the game, but I don't recommend it with 5-players.  It just takes too long.  It's also not a very intuitive game (due to lack of theme) to teach to non-gamers.  Having said that, it still has some very interesting decisions/mechanics.

- below average production quality
- Medium weight, not heavy
- Novel gameplay which simulate the draft process of "Magic: the gathering"
- around 80% of time my focus is solely on my area. Not much luxury to hurt the next player in drafting unless it is a 2p game.
--- Update: Rating moved from 7 to 8 since it is my most played strategy game in 2007-2008 (BSW, huh...), and I still won't turn down a game of ND, especially f2f!

First play - I must say I am impressed.  There hasn't really been a game over the past two years which had me up at night thinking of a new strategy.  Alea is back on track with this entry. 

For some reason, and I never thought I would ever say this, I think I would have preferred a victory point track compared to the hidden system.  It was really difficult for me to know where I stood when the last two turns arrived.

Still - can't wait to try this again.

RATING: 5
12/15/12 Played a four-player game in 1.7 hours. 
My first reaction to seeing the board was "yuck". Its is the most drab, uninspiring, and hard to decipher board I've seen in a very long time. And that's saying a lot for a veteran of over 550 different games. I'm afraid my opinion never changed. I was constantly asking, "What is that *very* tiny symbol?" Then, "And what does it mean?" I'm sure the game owner got sick of my questions, but I got sick of asking them. There is no "ramp up" effect, each turn was much like every other. The only tension was whether one could keep from maximizing on the rat track. Whoop-de-do. Yeah, its a game, and all the pieces work. But its as boring as the board looks.

RATING: 6
A great filler (3 player games takes only 30-45min). Very flowing gameplay and tough decisions. However you have very limited control over fellow players and that makes the game a bit too solitaire. There should have been a bit more interaction between players. Might be upgraded to '8' later (wanna try 5 player games).

Very smooth game play with some interaction ie using the carriage to grab the best message token from under someones nose, getting into Notre damn itself and of course the card drafting, but mostly planning ahead and building a winning strategy (something I failed to do, lol) 

Can't wait to play again.

Paris, fin du XIV siècle. Dans l'ombre de la majestueuse cathédrale Notre-Dame, vous jouez le rôle d'un influent citoyen, rivalisant avec les autres joueurs pour faire rejaillir sur vous le prestige du saint lieu. En prenant la tête d'un quartier de la capitale, vous devrez batailler ferme pour acquérir le contrôle des banques, auberges et autres bâtiments qui vous donneront divers avantages sur vos adversaires.

 Vous obtiendrez prospérité et renommée en allant chercher le soutien de différents personnages que vous devrez corrompre en utilisant votre or. Ce faisant vous apporterez votre contribution à Notre-Dame, dont le rayonnement sera le symbole de votre consécration. Mais surtout prenez garde à bien protéger vos concitoyens contre la menace incessante de la peste, car à trop vouloir gagner, il y'a souvent beaucoup à perdre !

RATING: 5
Initial rating after first 2 plays: 6,5 Nice game in Puerto Rico / El Grande / Louis XIV Eurostyle. Works with 2 as well. Once you get the hang of it, it plays a lot faster than the usual gamer's euro. Theme is pasted on, but not as bad as the average Knizia. Doesn't matter to me that much (I can appreciate a good abstract as well) I like the nice looking modular board & artwork. The hardest decision is which card too keep and which too give away to your neighbour. That's the only real player interaction part as well, but it's a constant confrontation....

Revisited this game a couple of years later, and obviously my taste in games has changed, or this has aged really fast. Felt like an average slightly boring euro this time. Downgraded my rating. Glad I never bought it.

RATING: 8.5
The epitome of dry, euro strategy, which is just fine with me.  The card drafting is very well used to build your actions each round, and I appreciate that there is always something beneficial to do, and often you're required to choose between multiple compelling options.  Not very difficult to teach and can play fairly quickly.  The icons on some of the cards aren't overly intuitive, but the instructions provide a nice guide.  I've only played with 3 and 4 players so far, so I'm eager to see how it works with 5.

A really great game here!  Simple mechanics, but a wide array of choices and play styles.  Moves along at a nice clip, yet with moments of seemingly momentous decision-making.  Not terribly tough to explain rules and such, but like most of the great games, will demand repeated play.  Beautiful components.  I wish there was a little more text (in German even) to support the cards.  Not a ton of intense player interaction, but the card passing is fun.  A good time.  Gets better with more plays!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It plays quick. Our learning game took just a bit over an hour.  The draft mechanism for cards is very interesting.  It causes tough decisions about what you want to keep versus what you give to the next player.

Combating the rats is important.  I think you need to get a cube or two into the hospital early in the game.  

The park also seems very important.  Every two cubes there give you an extra victory point on all victory point generating actions.

It is going on my buy list.

A solid Feld design, built around a simple but effective card draft. You try to build up efficiency in different areas, as each time you take an action in an area you add a cube to said area and for every cube in the area when you take the action, the better it will be. But you depend on getting access to these actions, which all depend on what you receive in the card draft. Each player draws three cards from their own personal deck, chooses one and hands the rest to the next player, out of the three cards they wind up with they will only play two.

At the end of each round you can potentially pay to gain a some kind of bonus, and you manage the rat count in your borough. At the end of the game whoever has the most points wins the game.

Only reason I've sold my copy is because I decided to buy the 10th anniversary edition (for the additional content)

I just skipped the whole "Wow, what a fabulous new Alea game!" syndrome, and jumped right to where I'm at with PR--it's fine, I'll play it, but the game is not, for me, greater than the sum of its parts, and I'm pretty bored with a few of its parts.  Do I really need yet another game where the exact value of every action can be easily discerned and the only variation comes from card draws and card drafting?  Well, maybe.

I actually think this game plays best with 2, but works up to 5 as well. I have the expansion and like to shuffle in unknown A, B, and C advisors, which means specific strategies can be a gamble.

Very nice game but lacks staying power.  I found this game to be one of my favorites from the 2007 Gathering of Friends; however, after getting to almost 10 plays I am finding that play sessions are strikingly similar in feel.  Tikal and Settlers and other "classics" continue to present new challenges and to tell new stories so that the experiences remain fresh.  All this is not to say Notre Dame isn't a very cool game.  It's clever and certainly worth having.  Great for occasional play.

In the end I just thought the experience was more fun.

Not a pretty or well themed game since you push cubes around but has a good deal of strategy.  One guy knocks it saying that there is always the obvious choice based on the cards you get but I feel there are many ways you can go with them.  Games are about one hour which is great so I can scratch that meatier game itch without taking up too much time.  The game really isn't too hard as after about 1 round you understand how to play even if you may not know what you should play.  My wife dominates at this game.

There is card-drafting, resource management, knowledge of upcoming character cards but not knowing the order, the 1 +  + 1 + 1 + ... mechanism, and the carriage / set collection mechanism, ...

Like may other euro-games...to be successful requires a delicate balance between money, resources, and victory points.

RATING: 7.5
Players place influence markers in one of eight different areas of the board, each of which gives a specific bonus.  Locations where players may place markers are determined by cards, which the player has some control over, but not a lot. This is appealingly similar to Puerto Rico, this game strikes me as having multiple strategic options for playing, yet the randomness of being a card-based game adds an unknown element.  I'm not sure whether the randomness of the card drawing is a good or a bad thing; it makes it just that much harder to try to carry out a plan. More playing is needed.

Kellemes, tipikusan "feldes" euró. Pont ideális szabályhossz, kiváló mechanizmusok (drafting, kumulált akciózás), valamint egy ötletes moduláris tábla, ami játékosszámtól függően változik.

A játék hossza sem veszélyes, miután tisztában van mindenki a szabályokkal, simán lemehet egy óra alatt.

Igazából nem tudok rá rosszat mondani, úgy jó, ahogy van. Jó, mégis: interakció a draftolás után szinte nulla és kicsit hajaz az In The Year of the Dragonra olyan tekintetben, hogy itt is előfordul a kényszer lépés, azaz próbáljuk menteni a menthetőt a patkányok miatt.

After a few plays and knowing generally when and what character cards will come up really helps to with winning the game, however, after that point the game seems to be more at the mercy of what card combinations you draw.  Still a fairly good game.

Fun game.  I've enjoyed Feld's other game too, In the Year of the Dragon.  This one is a bit lighter.  They both have a similar mechanic where each person gets the same cards which they must play over the course of a number of rounds.  I'll probably buy at least one of the two.

Our 3rd Feld that we tried (after CoB and Trajan) and we like it too! This game is a little bit more lightweight as the other two but it has a nice modular board, indirect interaction with the card drafting and some luck with the person cards. And then you need to keep the rats away... very interesting multi-player solitaire game! And the time to play is just right: 60-90 minutes. I'd like to play it more often to get to know the best strategy to win.

The theme was better than most euros for me.  It might have been the rats and hunchback, but something clicked a little bit.  The engine underneath the game is interesting, and results in interesting gameplay.  It still felt very dry and meticulous.  It's not great, not good, but just okay for me.

First tried this on BSW and was a little lost, but after a few plays really started to see the beauty of it. Then picked up the Rio Grande edition as an open box discount at Drexoll, and after playing in person, I think I'm hooked. I really like the multiple paths to victory, and the intensity with which people debate them (carriage = awesome or stupid? you decide). The significant card draw randomness is offset by the way it really stretches people's tactical thinking, and makes sure you don't fall into the trap of using the same approach every time (my one and only criticism of PR).

This is really a soliatire game and it plays really well with only 1, go for a big score.  I lay out it out for three players and simply pick one card out of the 3 I draw to keep and then draw 1 random card from each of the other 2 decks as the cards passed to me.  Then I place one cube that isn't mine in Notre Dame at the end of round 1 and one addition cube that isn't mine at the end of round 2.  Try and break 90 points.

Rated after one play. Another solid game from Feld, but it didn't really capture me the way Castles of Burgundy or Bora Bora did. Still, I suspect I will grow to enjoy this game more on further plays. I played very poorly, and the game seems pretty unforgiving of early mistakes. Not a bad thing, but I will definitely have to put more thought into my moves if/when I play this again.

Nice edition to my Alea collection.  I really don't mind the multi-player solitaire aspect although the card passing does give you a chance to really help another player if you are not careful.  I know the Park is important but am still having fun figuring out the best way to play if you can't count on getting Park cards passed to you.  Seems like there is no sure fire way to win which of course is a good thing.  Update: This game has now replaced St. Petersburg as my favorite game to play on BSW.  A two-player game on BSW takes only 10-15 minutes while yielding lots of strategic challenge. My strategy tip for new players is to focus on filling the hospital with 3 cubes as quickly as possible, get as many cubes as possible into play, and always have a gold available for bribing each round.

One of Feld's first big Euro hits and for many it is up there with his best.

In Notre Dame the players are rich families that own whole boroughs that surround the grand cathedral in Paris. 

Each turn they are trying to improve their own Burrough and to do so they must use their actions wisely and the characters that frequent the great city. 

Notre Dame uses a draft, smaller in nature but much the same as that used in 7 Wonders. The draft gives each person 3 actions of which they can use 2 each round. Because all players have the same cards in their deck they must consider carefully which cards to keep and which to move on. Those paying attention can try to remember which cards other players have passed from their own decks and use that knowledge to make wise decisions. 

As the players improve their Burroughs they will also gain benefits for doing so. These in turn help to build an engine with which to earn Victory Points. 

One major consideration is that of the rat build up in the wharf district, which can lead to plague. At the end of each round (of which there are 9) each Burrough see an increase in rats. The players can try to keep this problem under control by improving their hospital and the park district to name but a few.

Notre Dame is a great game that plays in 40-50 minutes for experienced players and has plenty of options to ensure that not everything can be achieved. 

It also plays well with 2.

Just purchased, ~20 plays f2f and on BSW

Tense tight puzzle of a game. Plays in a short time and lets you know when you stuff up. Unforgiving to the unthinking, but not so much of a brain burner. Leaves you wanting to return for another go at beating your score. I don't think it is a multi-player solitaire. The passing of cards, carriage and playing to Notre Dame all change depending on what others are doing. People understanding this can really stifle your efforts or if you aren't thinking about this you can hand points to your opponents on a platter.

Plays very well with two.

I REALLY did not get this at all. It felt like each player was doing his/her own thing, with no interaction at all.

I was quite literally bored with this.

I felt like this one was a tad overhyped when compared to other Feld games, but it's still enjoyable enough. One thing I'll say is that the rats are by far the most punishing aspect to any Feld game I've played to date. I don't think any other Feld game comes close to being as punishing as Notre Dame is. Everything else about the game has been done since then, and probably even a little bit better, but Notre Dame works as a quick, brain-burner of a Euro game. Multiple plays have really made me realize how limited the replay value to this one is, but I almost don't want to get rid of it because of it being out of print.

RATING: 6.5
Notre Dame is a decent game in the Euro cube pusher genre. That may come off as a bit of a negative sounding statement but a lot of what people say about this game is correct. It is a little generic in its feel in that you move cubes around each turn and make decisions from a limited amount of possible actions. The game is certainly one of those games where you'd like to do A,B,C and D but only have enough resources to do A and B... and maybe sometimes C if you plan ahead well. The game rewards some careful planning as you try and balance your cash and number of cubes available while keeping a careful watch on the amount of detrimental effects (rats) that will count against you each round and lower your prestige point score. Let the rats build up too high and you lose cubes and prestige points. In the end all that matters IS prestige points so every action you decide on must take that into account... achieving as high a score as possible in the prestige point column is THE goal. 

The games strong suit is that there is a variable number of ways to achieve  that goal and no two games will play out quite the same and no two players will likely take the same path to achieving that goal either. There is luck  of the draw in terms of which cards you draw and which cards you are passed by other players each turn... but over the course of 9 rounds I feel the luck is reasonably dished out to all those involved. I like the card passing mechanism as there is often 2 or even 3 cards you want but you need to prioritize and make some hard choices to make sure your most needy area is dealt with first.

All in all this is a very mechanically sound game with a pretty solid "angst per minute" ratio. This is usually a sign of a solid game for me, yet Notre Dame just comes up a bit short so far. It seems as if the ideas are solid enough and the mechanisms are solid enough yet the sum of the parts doesn't quite add up to a magnificent, memorable game. Instead I think the game is solid and enjoyable played occasionally but not a game that I would want to play all that often. 

I give this game a 6.5 for now and admit that may be a bit low based on the gameplay which is interesting enough but not good enough to inspire repeat plays of any regularity and that's my main qualitative evaluation of a game... how much do I want to play it again and again. As we play a few more times my appreciation may rise for this game but there are other games both heavier and lighter in weight that I'd rather see on the table more often.

This game has a fine game play, but the orginality of it is lacking. 
My winnning strategy. First, you have gather resources (money, cubes) and stay afway from the rats. From half way in the second round, you score points and still keep away from the rats. In the last round the rats don't matter anymore as you can win more points than the rats cost. Who cares about loosing a cube, from the supply areas you don't need them anymore. 
If some doesn't agree with me please let me know! I am open for other winning strategies.

This game has quickly become my favorite game of the year!!  It is quick and challenging and so many paths to victory....watch those rats!!  Must not let them overrun your town.......I just love this game as it is half the time of Puerto Rico but just as good and perhaps better, in my book.  The modular board is amazing how it works for 2-5 players and the game is tense and exciting and quick enough with any number of players due to the card interaction of passing like in hearts.

Wonderful, wonderful.  Thank you ALEA and Rio Grande again!  Looks good on my shelf too with the big number on the side continuing my Big Box Alea collection with the big #11 on the side!!

RATING: 7.5
Overall comment: a game that has cards but less luck than most card games, it is simple to pick up and initially hard to get a decent score. Newer players enjoy it and want to replay.

Ratings:
Initial(wow factor): 8 (a bit confusing looking and the board sections are initally hard to distinguish)
Family: 9 (everyone will play this one)
Game group: 7 (if time is short it gets played but not otherwise)
AP rating: 9 (little downtime)
Solo play: 9 (mimics the normal play well and plays very quick - #5 for SoloPlay currently)

When purchased: 2008
Recommended expansions: none available
Age range: 8+
Luck factor: 5

Reason purchased: Geek and gamer's recommendation through on-line play

Pros: plays quick, there are a mixture of light to moderate decisions to be made, the game scales well and solo play (it is multi-player solitaire) was an easy step
Cons: after many plays the best strategies are obvious, very little variability in games, many moves are very obvious especially in the last round

Recommendation: it is a good light game that if not played too often provides a nice break from reality.  Solo play is more interesting than klondike and has a similiar feel.  Serious players will probably not have long term interest in the mechanics nor the game.
Replay rating: Below average (heavy initially but it has tapered off drastically)
Game value (play/cost ratio):slightly above average due to its family friendly feel

Game based on the Notre Dame Cathedral. Each player has a borough with 7 areas and their own deck of cards. Each round, they draw three cards, pick one and pass the other two to the left, choose another, so they end up with 3 cards total. Only 2 are played. Cards put tokens into the boroughs or Notre Dame, to gain VPs, money, more tokens, hospital, hotel, etc. At the end of each round, persons available for hire contribute to a plague total, which can be reduced. If not, VPs are lost if one exceeds the plague value of 9. Game ends after 9 rounds. This is a very good game, with many tough decisions to make. Each game is different, and there are many strategies to try, given that the cards come out in different orders and combinations. This is a well designed game.

This game is quite nice. It's a shame really but that is all I can say that is good about this game. Terrible this game is certainly not but when I played it there just seemed to be something missing. 

I think it was the fact that you never really seem to be going anywhere. All the time trying to avoid some sort of missfortune (plague, not having any money or men) that the idea of getting victory points seems a little secondary. At the end I had won but I didn't really feel like I'd deserved it and that I'd just kinda blundered into it like some drunken oaf piling into the bins after leaving the pub.

For a game by Stephan Feld, Notre Dame is remarkably simple, I just wasn't impressed by it. I like that it has card drafting, but that was about all. The theme is weak and rather bland.

Most of all, I found the game just too limiting. You're always short of something, be it cubes (or whatever they represent), cash, or actions. All game it felt like I needed to do 3 things per round, but only had the opportunity to do 2, and this just didn't sit well with me.

RATING: 7
Played this with 3 and we enjoyed it.  7 Wonders card drafting mechanic before it became popular drives this game.  Most cards you play will be directly affected by how many pieces you have in the spot correlated to the card you played, i.e. you have 3 pieces in the hospital when you play the card, you get to do something special 3x instead of just 1x.

Watch your plague track, you don't want that destroying your game, but do NOT forget to score your points at the Notre Dame itself, or else you won't compete in points in the end!

Now this is a fast Feld! (beating out Macao and CoB by 30+%) Yes, there is the Feldian many different orthogonal actions to choose from (get and invest in more income; get and invest in more victory points; fight off plague and learn permanent plague-fighting skillz; drive around town collecting message bonuses; try for area control in Notre Dame central; etc), but there's also a drafting mechanic, and the rounds are super short. You only end up doing 18 actions in a game. The game whizzed by and had enough randomization that it should replay well.
---
...but maybe in all the lightness, there's not that much to this game? With so little time for engine, it seems more efficient just to always go for victory points.
---
the Treasure Chest expansion is a godsend for this game. Finally, some variation so that not all games play the same way -- you don't always have to build toward Lady of the Court in round C. Upping from 7.

RATING: 3
Ouch.  There's a lot going on all at once here (Caylus), and it's painful how many choices you will never make in a game (Princes of Florence).  But the game flows by if you're not playing with the AP-prone, and the strategies are a little more straightforward for the new player than, say, Puerto Rico.  And you'd think that'd be great, but the only good thing about it is that it means the game will end sooner.

I'm trying to compare it to any of the aforementioned games and ask if I'd recommend it to a player that already owned one of those games, and after five games, the answer to that recommendation is "no".  There is very little game here and even less "fun", another victim of "too much, not enough" syndrome.  The turn limit feels artificial, the choices are obvious, and the theme is transparent.

I like the mechanic of passing your action cards to the other players. After two plays, it seems like it's not necessarily important to completely avoid the penalties from rat infestation. As long as you can collect victory points enough to offset this, you can still come out with the win. Make sure that you don't neglect collecting money and cubes, otherwise, you'll wind up with turns where you can't take any actions. Being able to buy the actions is important, since it give your three actions per round instead of only two. This is a big advantage and should be taken whenever possible, I think.

(I also own expansion from "Alea/Rio Grande Chest")

I really like Notre Dame. Card drafting and mechanics overall make the game feel balanced with everyone having about equal chances but drafting sometimes offer unpredictable chances. Gameplay is mainly about adapting and doing right tactical choices but you should have a strategic plan how to get those precious points. A very basic euro boardgame but a very, very good overall design. There is just about perfect balance between luck and control. Although there is not much interaction between players but there is always a lot to think about in a relatively short playing time. ND scales well 3-5 players and works as a two player game too but isn't as good with just two. 

One of the best games that can easily be played in an hour. Always a pleasure to play.

Based on 2 plays with 2 players. Fun game, but gets a bit boring after awhile and is held back a bit by it's purely tactical nature. Will get occasional plays, but I see it being pushed to the side by quite a few other games.

Surprisingly good for an Alea game. 

Yes, it does follow the usual Alea standards of extremely dull graphics, completely lacking a theme, and being very low on player interaction. Still, it feels quite fun and, most of all, plays very very quickly.

Prepare to lose astronomically when playing against BSW junkies.

On first look this is the type of faire that I'd expect from Alea. However, despite some really good game mechanisms and multiple paths to victory, it does feel like the mechanics are there just for the sake of it without the theme really tying them together. (8)

Altro grande gioco di Feld con regole semplici ma dinamiche profonde. La preparazione della plancia di gioco in base al numero di giocatori e il particolare draft sono delle vere chicche. Le diverse strategie di gioco lo rendono un gioillino che può vantare anche una durata contenuta. Un ottimo gioco.

RATING: 8.5
Outstanding action economy and damage-control; a quintessential Euro in many ways. Mixing the action selection with the movement of the carriages and a goodly number of joker options shows how well-considered and tested this must have been, which sadly hasn't been the case with a lot of similar games rushed to market. The design of the compound board is a delight.

Fun game. I like the fact that you specialize in attributes; the more cubes you place there, the stronger you get in that particular area. And it plays very quickly, particularly online.

Notre Dame is a dense game, and difficult to grok. On the surface, it is a simple card drafting role-selection economic game. It requires a pretty deep understanding of how to build your engine and score points that does not come with the typical skim-the-surface experience most players have with the game. However, once you achieve basic mastery of the game (usually with at least a couple dozen plays, the basic underlying strategies begin to emerge and the possibility of strong player interaction becomes apparent. The game becomes better, the more you play and understand it.

UPDATE: Our group has had fun with this one, and even Wifey got in on the action. 9->9.5

Highest score I've seen is 93. New personal best is 85 using a combination of 4 in park, carriage, residence, and ND. woot!

RATING: 7
Had high expectations and was a bit let down, probably just due to the age of the game now. A bit simpler than I expected, but it's still a nice light-medium game. The board is fairly bland, and despite how clever the board assembly is, it just looks a bit messy to me on the table - but I do appreciate it not going the route of simply not using sections of the board in a lesser-player game (Metropolys, etc). It really does feel like everyone is playing their own game separately, and if it weren't for the carriages, there would be no point in even taking turns. The uber-slim card drafting is interesting, but doesn't offer much control. Gold is extremely tight and worth a lot, which I like.

I like the design of this game.  The rats are probably my favorite part of this game - well trying not to get crushed by them, while still picking up a few points along the way.

Pretty heavy, fair bit to explain for the first game.  It all makes sense, it's just a lot for a new player to think about.

It does scale well from 2-5 and play quickly for all that you get to do.

Just got the game on weekend. Only had a chance to solo test run it. So far I like the mechanic and there seems to have many paths to winning. However, would the crowds be too quiet when playing this? Slight multi-player solitaire concern exists. I'll see if I'd bump up the rating after actual plays.

2009/8/24
After 4 2er games (with friend and with gf seperately,) I find myself not too fond of this game. Yes the game is balance, yes there are multi-path to victory... BUT, I feel that the entire game is about get more A, get more B, get more C, get more A&B, get more A&C, get more B&C, reduce rats etc. The profession cards are also just that. Okay I know most of the games are just like that too, but somehow the mechanic and the theme is not attractive to us. There seems to be less of a chance to go creative in the game. Simply put, we just didn't have a lot of fun while playing it. 
So I'm dropping it from 8 to 7.

It's true! This game gets better with more plays. However my gf and buddies still don't enjoy it, pitty. I'm bumping the score from 7 to 8 again though!

RATING: 8.5
One of Feld's early games that lead to his current status as a "victory point salad" designer. As always, there are too many ways to get points and not enough actions to feel like you're accomplishing anything great. Game play is gathered around a card-drafting mechanic of ten different cards every round; play two, but "burn" one. And because victory points are kept in front of you, not on a track where everyone can see who's leading, the winner isn't clear until the very last round. Any time I've played this game, I feel like I'm doing well and then realize I'm in last place; it's fun until it's not. What I most appreciate about his games is that there is always an anti-victory point action; an element that will eat at the points you've worked so hard for. It can be distracting because you might have to take time off from building your engine for victory points, but those strategies don't have to be exclusive to each other in a turn. Meaningful decisions are at the core of every Feld game; you won't know that you're eliminating your path to victory until much later in the game. The cards you draft from round to round may limit or free you; if you're the only one doing that one particular action, chances are you're winning. The best element of design for this game is that the board changes with the amount of players; and they resemble stained glass when put together. Not one of my favorites from this designer but definitely enjoyable.

RATING: 9
This game fabulously suits my engine building and low-pus preferences. You want to do everything - get money to pay for an extra action each turn, get your rat protection up to avoid losing points each turn, get your cube count up so you can build the power of your chosen actions, and then, oh yeah, actually score points. But of course you can’t do it all. Your strategy is driven by the action cards you draw (there are 9 different actions), what action cards remain, the knowledge of which actions you pass away to your rivals (and thus won’t be able to do in a later turn) plus your analysis of what action cards your rivals will likely pass to you given their board state and previous passes to you. The action card passing means everyone’s strategies diverge, and the striving to get the most out of the strategy you settle on is engaging. It makes for a clever and thinky Euro, but without being over-thinky - it moves along at a nice pace. To do well, you need to know and plan for the end-of-game bonuses (maximising the benefits of as many as possible), and this is a potential downside for new players that may hinder their enjoyment, a hump that needs to be overcome. With replay though, I’ve found it provides me a new and interesting challenge each game that I thoroughly enjoy.

"Quick, but feels long. I'm not a fan of pass-drafting in general, but dislike it even more here. More complicated than its fans think."

What I like:
- Modular board is an amazingly clever design
- Low confrontation, and no majority scoring
- Finished in 90 minutes with 5p and 3 first-timers
- Rat mechanism is nice

What I don't like:
- Pass-drafting
- Even at 90 minutes it felt long
- Drafting should alternate directions

It is more complicated than it's 2.8 weight rating. Mechanically there are several things going on, and the cards are special abilities that you have to first learn and memorize, and the during the game remember what you have seen and what you have not.

RATING: 7
Fantastic game! When you explain it to other players it sounds really complex, but once you start playing it, it's really incredibly easy to get the hang of. The box says it may take up to 75 mins, but if you know your way, this game can be played in little over 30 mins, 45 max! Even with 5 players!

The great thing is also that, no matter how many players are playing, it's the same challenge! Unlike most of the games that are for a variable number of players, in this game, players always play with the exact same resources, whereas in other games you got more components for less players, which makes thing "delute" a bit and doesn't mostly provide the pretended experience (think Puerto Rico for example), not the case here! Fantastic work Stefan Feld!!!

Even though I have played this before it's so many games ago this comment is regarded as it was after the first game:

I like the simple mechanics but with strategic depth. Drafting of actions is neat, but other than that interaction is only about picking up messages and influence in notre dame. Our game didn't have much competition with messages and payoff for notre dame was uncontrollable. 

I got stuck the last few rounds due to bad luck in what action i got and that showed when scoring. 

Need to play more to get some feeling for the game.

A game that initially seemed dull during the rules explanation but I found really gripping once play started. A lot of rules to be explained upfront, which makes it seem like the game is going to complicated, but it flows so elegantly once play begins.

RATING: 8
I really like how the board changes to suit 3 to 5 players, each with his own identical area. More importantly the game play is simple as you draft cards and then play two of the three that you drafted in order to activate the sections on your board. Some sections appear much more advantageous than others however the card control decides who can activate each region so be sure to watch the person to your left and pas him cards accordingly. Plays well with any number of players.

RATING: 8
Card "pick and pass" drafting combined with a Feldian system of choosing actions and balancing resources.  Some of the choices as to which cards to keep each round are downright excruciating because you need all of them.  I also like how  board is put together depending on the player count.  Another huge plus for this game is that it has a really good solo variant in the forums.  Playing the solo variant will actually improve your face to face play.

Questo sì che è un gioco tedesco! Mezza pagina di regole, bella ambientazione (per essere un German Game), ottima scalabilità e longevità. L'interazione, a prima vista assente, è invece onnipresente: sia indiretta (la rotazione delle carte azione al tuo vicino) che diretta (la conquista delle tessere con la carrozza, la competizione per Notre Dame). Le meccaniche di gioco, elegantissime, lo fanno filar liscio fino alla sua conclusione: se tutti lo conoscono già, si può arrivare a terminare il gioco in meno di un'ora. Una spruzzata di alea la danno, oltre alle carte azione, sia le tessere che i personaggi a fine turno. Questi ultimi, oltre a introdurre un po' di varietà, hanno un ruolo a volte fondamentale nel bilancio di un Quartiere o nella realizzazione di punti prestigio. Da segnalare la plancia di gioco "mutante" a seconda del numero di giocatori: una lezione di geometria. Difetti: come in altri giochi - mi viene in mente Puerto Rico - la presenza di un giocatore esperto alla tua destra può renderti la vita difficile. Inoltre, la qualità di alcuni materiali - specialmente i "petali" - non è eccelsa. 
Un gioiello.

Played a couple of plays efter a long time again. Upgrading to 10.

***

Played again after a long time. The 9 still stands. I think I must have played this over 30 times, both 5, 4, 3 and 2-player games (mostly 2-players) and it is just a solid design with fun gameplay. Too bad Macao could not live up to this..

***

At first Notre Dame was a rather bleach experience. I thought it was pretty mediocre, pleasant enough but lacking in personality. I would probably have rated it a "6" if I had rated it after the first play. But over time, and with more plays, my impressions have changed and continue to do so - this is indeed a terrific little game. 

I think this is the game that made me change my opinion the most over time in a positive way (Pillars of the Earth is the game that change the most with more plays in a negative way). 

It is somewhat of a "multiplayer solitaire", and it plays equally good with 2,3 or 4 players (5 is not that good). Analytical and a bit on the dry side, but with extremly good replayability. The game is not that hard to grasp, but there is a obvious learning curve, so with more plays you'll do better and better. Me and my wife plays this often.

Nice game with the passing and planning on your moves.  I liked the racing aspect of the carriages.  I like how it's limited in its rounds.  Working against the plague is a nice mechanic.

The game can be a little fiddley and other than the carriages and passing cards, not too interactive.

Overall it's a solid game.

The game is very clever: the choices are constrained by the game itself (the available districts), by luck (the cards that are drawn) and by the other players (the cards that are passed around). Players need to have a long term strategy but also adapt constantly to the situation. There's a definite learning curve, because a key element in the game is planning ahead for specific characters.

It's also a pretty fast affair and scales very well from 2 to 5. Player interaction is low and subtle, but that is actually a plus for me.

One of those games in which you are struggling between life and death and have just too many things to consider.
The game was ok, but probably I was expecting a bit more than this... This one is really hard to say, would it be 6 or 7. Replay needed.

I was surprised by how enjoyable a game this is. The first charm is the clever modular board, which tessellates perfectly according to the number of players. The interactions in the game are fairly indirect - you have some control over which actions your opponent has access to, and you can grab the convenient messages on the board first - but this is enough to make the game seem more than just a puzzle.

I am swept away by Feld's lighter titles! This is my third Feld that I've played(second that I own) and I am loving it!

I am more of a family games' guy so this fits my taste better than Trajan (2nd Feld I've played). This game has the rat mechanics to make you feel that you have "tough" decisions to make throughout the game.

I think by the time that I can figure out a strategy to this game I will have enough plays to make the price tag worth it. There is enough random factors in the game such as card drafting, random-ed person bribe cards, and the carriage point tokens to make this game very replayable.

I also have the expansion, I sure will try it out when I am bored with the base set of cards.

---- Update----
Rats are more manageable with experience but it is still possible to have them run amok!

Notre Dame is the first game in quite a while that I knew I must have after one play.  While nothing is wholly novel, it employs many clever mechanisms, and plays equally well with 3, 4, or 5 players all in roughly an hour's worth of play.  Neither brain burning nor fluffy.

Initially I started buying a couple of the titles in the Alea range due to rave reviews, but I soon realised by #4 (Princes or Puerto Rico?) that I am not the target audience. And now playing #11 (this one) reminds me again why the word Alea doesn't excite me. Interesting and unique card play in that you have to pass 2 of the 3 cards drawn from your own deck; there is some inherent fun in this as there can be coincidences of being given a card you have just passed on as well as giving a useless card. Played with 3 a couple of times which I think is the sweet spot because you know something of what will be in your 2 competitor's hands. A recent (and a long time between another) play with 5 has forced a rating drop due to having to relearn what the sectors and cards do, so less of a game and more of a question and answer session. This experience highlights that although ND is an interesting management game (with the pressure of rats ruining your status) it is the typical "many cost effective avenues to vps exercise" and so has to wait for it's turn in the sun.

I played 590 games of Notre Dame (on BSW). For the last 200 games, I played the same strategy over and over and I averaged 71-72 VP. I never looked at what the other players were doing. The games only differed on a tactical level. The best players played the same strategy. Against them, luck of the draw determines the winner. Therefore, I can't say this game has any level of depth.

That said, it's an enjoyable game (I played it 590 times after all) and I would not kill your pleasure by revealing any strategy tips and I recommend to nobody to look for them.

RATING: 5
Played this once and I failed to get a significant number of cubes on the board before being overrun by rats. It was an uphill battle the rest of the game to get cubes and kill rats. I finished with a tie for last in a 5p. Still, I thought there were enough interesting decisions I'd like to play again, and I think this problem should be easy enough to avoid in future. Card passing was a bit irksome as I never seemed to get the cards I needed. However, it is most of the only player interaction in this game. Components are a bit flimsy, but the modular board for different # of players is a novel and effective idea. I tend to like games with scant resources and lots of things you want to do with them, which is what keeps me interested.

Edit: I just don't care much what happens...none of the routes to victory seem unbalanced, but it doesn't seem to matter what you go for either. It's short, a little too short, and not very satisfying. Park is overpowered, and the one that gives you only one thing unless you have 4 cubes (!?!) there is worthless. Not a bad game, but not exciting either.

A classic cube farmer, Notre Dame's variety of possible strategies keep the game interesting. The components are good, especially the cards, and the cute wooden pieces. The theme is pasted on, but I don't care. The drafting card mechanic is probably the best part of the game, forcing you to change you strategy based on the available cards.

Update: A good bit of luck in the cards you draw each turn, and with larger numbers of players there isn't much you can do to hurt players across the table from you. But it's still a fun euro. Plays a bit mechanically, with the similar actions each game, kill rats, get points, buy workers. Downgrading from 8 -> 7.5.

Update: There's more strategy and less luck in the 2 player game. 7.5 -> 7.75

Update: I do like the variety of how many ways you can get points. Lots of different strategies. 7.75 -> 8

Pick and pass roll selection, otherwise a bit of multi-player solitaire (low interaction). Minimal player downtime and luck outcomes (paying attention to your neighbors is still important). Clever modular board.  Light enough mechanics to teach easily, but several hidden layers of strategy (multiple paths to victory). Plays well with all player counts. 
Theme is implemented well; everyone we've introduced it to has enjoyed the different mechanics (containing the rats, carriage, cathedral). 

It really is a 'by-the-book' light Euro, it seems to do all the traditional things without over staying its welcome. Certainly a good stepping stone to other Euros. Very solid and satisfying game.

-One of the districts feels a bit under powered (can't say I've even seen the Inn as anything but a last resort). There is a well regarded expansion which generates additional variety game to game that is largely unavailable =(

RATING: 7
This is a really interesting engine building and drafting game with a ton of player interaction. The idea is that each player gets a symmetrical deck of cards. On their turn they draw three cards from their deck, keep 1 and pass the others, until everyone has a three card hand again. Then each player gets to resolve two of the three cards as actions. The actions build on each other, so all following times you preform action A, Action A gets stronger in it's effect. You do this three times, and at the end of each of these there is a scoring of the center tile.

The game has an interesting system where if you don't take actions to prevent rats, then you wind up taking penalties. It's curiously a viable strategy to both invest into rat prevention and ignore rats completely and focus on grabbing as many points as possible and just eating the penalties. Since each player only gets one card per age that allows them to place a cube into the center scoring area, these cards tend to not get passed, which can make the center scoring a little anti-climactic.

Very interesting hand/resource management game. Certainly want to get at least one piece in Notre Dame (and have 2 or 3 gold to spare). Make sure that some gold and one playing piece are always in hand. Hospital build up can occur when the 'Move 3' card is purchased for rat control; really don't get into the 'rat penalty' death spiral. Your 'Best friend' really is too! It'll take more playings to see how many vialble strategies there are, or if it's all about making mostly obvious choices when the cards are (re)distributed.

An old-school Feld game that plays very smoothly. Card drafting is the main mechanic here as you are essentially drafting the actions you can take during each round. You have to manage your money, your workers, and also the rat problem that is plaguing the city. It is up to the player to build the best efficiency engine. The Notre Dame donation and the end-of-round nobles add some intrigue to the game.

Was interested in it because of the designer. I liked the board design but that was about it. It seems to be a well crafted game, but I was not enthused (or is it amused) about it. I not a fan of card-drafting - especially where you can get stuck with a worthless to you card but can't pass it on since you know that it quite worthwhile to the next in line. Even so I didn't see much interaction other than trying to manipulate the cards.

First impression. The material is O.K. the rules are not very clear at first read. The main problem we had is to remember what where each cards all about, wich is not simple only looking at the pictograms on the cards. Du to that, the game seemed slow and without energy. We will have to play more to confirm the score.
Second game. The paste was faster so the game was more endjoyable. But the two player game is missing the little something to make it a great game. 7.5 is my game score.
A couple of 4 player games. The game is becoming more fun. Definitly a four to five players game. Increasing the rating to 8

Première impression: le matériel est OK, les règles ne sont pas très claires à la première lecture. Le problème principale que nous avons fait face lors de notre partie est de comprendre les pictogrammes sur les cartes afin de savoir quel était la fonction de chacune d'elle. À cause de ceci la partie nous a semblé lente et sans énergie. Nous allons devoir y rejouer afin de confirmer le score.
Deuxième partie. Le rythme de la partie fut plus rapide ce qui a rendu le jeu plus intéressant. Par contre, ce jeux semble manquer d'un petit je ne sais quoi à deux pour en faire un très bon jeu. Cote à 7.5
Quelques parties à cinq joueurs. Le jeu devient de plus en plus plaisant. Définitivement un jeu pour 4 à 5 joueurs. Augmentation de la cote à 8

Like almost every other recent Eurogame, at least to me.  Pick from several options and call that a "strategy" (carriage strategy, rat control strategy, Notre Dame strategy, park strategy, you get the idea).  Then hope to hell that one "strategy" doesn't dominate and become "the only way to play."

For what it's worth, I played the "eschew any trips to Notre Dame, keep the rats under control, and drive like a maniac all over Paris picking up tokens strategy" and won on a tiebreaker.  Don't need to play it again, but probably will once or twice more during my life.

A former Euro from when I was first getting into this whole modern gaming thing. It really wasn't bad, all things considered, and I think this pre-dated Feld's fiddly period. But Notre Dame is pretty simple, at heart, where you play a card and accomplish an action and you have to juggle your own goals with the presence of the "bad color" (to borrow a Martin Wallace term) which in this game are the rats. 

I got rid of it because it's a card drafting game that doesn't really work wth 2p that well, and additionally the cards aren't balanced, so you pretty much never choose the hotel. It was fun to play when I was first getting into these things.

Rating may go up once I see how well it stands up after multiple plays.

A fun game but once you get really familiar with the people to bribe, you can't play with new players any more because you will crush them.

Simply put this is not a Top 50 game. It has too obvious of strategies, and not enough different viable strategies to distinguish itself from the many other similar games. Once played, it really doesn't compel me to play it again. I'm sure I could optimize my play after analyzing the benefit of each card more, but that's really all there is to this game (the pursuit of "the optimal play"). Its greatest virtue is that it is plays fast and doesn't take a long time.
1-22-12 I came back to make a comment that I am personally relieved that Notre Dame is #100 and will soon be out of the Top 100 - it's inclusion there was an ongoing slight to the rankings.

Welcome return to form by Alea. Super easy to jump right in to this one. There's enough strategies to try out to keep it interesting - I've seen different strategies win the day each game.

RATING: 10
I love the multiple paths to victory in Notre Dame.  I also enjoy simultaneous role selection and Notre Dame throws a twist on this mechanic by using drafting in conjunction with simultaneous selection.  I also love the two-fold role selection aspect.  In the first part of the turn, the drafting part, the other players cannot usually take the actions you take (when you take an action it limits the other players ability to take this action).  The end part of the turn where you buy the assistance of a person, can be taken by everyone, but because each person has different options in the beginning of each turn, there are different advantages to take different assistants. I love the interaction of the two parts of each sub-turn.

While I think Notre Dame is great for two and three players, I don't like it as well for more because there will be one player who you can only affect with your carriage.  I love the interaction with the drafting mechanic and it does not work as well with more than three.  There is also no way to guess what cards the player(s) whose cards I never see have left.

A game that I like, but one that I fear may not see much play time.  The game is quite unforgiving...if you fall behind, or make some mistakes it is very difficult to recover.  This makes it unfun to play for the first time or two.  It gets much better with further play, but getting others to play again after a difficult first play is a challenge.  It may not be worth the effort when there are better games out there.

To me this is a bit of a cross between Agricola and something else.  Mulit-single player like Agricola and a lighter feel of play.  Good game and fun; although not really my style.  I think the rat infestation's are very fun but not made challenging enough in the game mechanic because they are quite easy to avoid with a few plays under the proverbial belt.  

It has crossed my mind to add one, two or three rats per turn within the respective A, B and C phases.  Perhaps adding zero, one and two would be enough.

The primary mechanism of selecting and passing cards, "Draft style" is really interesting and fun in this game.  The first time I played it, that was enough to keep me interested.  After a few more plays, when I started focusing on longer term strategies, and paying more attention to the cards my neighbors were keeping or passing, I began to enjoy this game on a whole new level.

I like that there are unknowns in this game and things that are outside of your control, but not really "randomness" per-say (other then which tiles you get for driving or possibly what order the people you can hire come up in)  I never feel like I got screwed by a bad roll, or an unfortunate card when I play this game.

Wow! What a fantastic game!
Notre Dame combines a lot of classic game mechanics into one smooth experience. It plays fast and is full of meaningful choices. I'm terrible at preparing myself for the plague rats and find myself taking hits often, but I've always said the sign of a great game is one where you can still have fun losing, and man, this was a blast.

RATING: 7.5
There was some scripting to been already in our first session(at least 3p-game) but surely there is a small learning curve in the game. I'm a bit pessimistic about the replay value since there is isn't many changing factors, just the order things come out. The key to victory is to most optimally react to these changes each and plan in a manner that benefits you the most. I think you learn this game quite quickly and some things become obvious eventually. Still a nice light eurogame that requires planning and good play.

A wonderful medium-light Euro from the brilliant Stefan Feld - playable in less than an hour, even with 5, and full of meaningful decisions. It's almost a filler, although despite the speed of play it doesn't quite feel like one. I don't want to play this all the time, but it's a great game for a spare 30-45 minutes.

One play and I'm hooked.  I suppose the player boards and shape of the box make it similar to PR, but that isn't why I like it.  You can plan out a strategy in the beginning and follow it through.  There is some tactical play as far as picking up messages, influence in Notre Dame, and the passing of cards, but for the most part you can play out a given strategy from beginning to end.  I like tactical play, but every once in a while (a la PR) I like to formulate a game plan and play it out to see how it does against other players.  Notre Dame is a really good game for this.

Being at the mercy of which cards you get would be fine in a quick light game, but Notre Dame seems like it ought to be deep.  Unfortunately, there's no clear opportunity for long-term strategic thinking.  The game just feels like a bunch of stuff jumbled together with a tenuous theme.

RATING: 7.9
(+) A lot of game for a limited set of rules
(+) You get a feeling of "progress" while playing the game
(+) The game is very flexible: The rules are easily explained, it doesn't take too long to play, the game is accessible to casual gamers yet equally satisfying to "hardcore gamers". I have yet to share a game of Notre Dame with people who were not enthusiast about it after play.
(+) Original gaming mechanism
(+) Theme is not great, but still rather good considering this is a Feld-title

(-) Some core mechanisms have been "picked up" in more recent games, however Notre Dame still manages to blend those mechanisms in the most elegant way

Approx gametime: 15 min / player

A fantastic light Euro which I was lucky to pick up in the Works Rio Grande sale.  Works brilliantly in two player but gets even better with more.

RATING: 6
A good game that I enjoyed, but coming one week after a play of Trajan, knocking the rating down as I do prefer Trajan over this one.  I feel the game is a bit too limited in its actions available to players who are constantly trying to optimize the that they have.  A poor card draw on a turn can hamper when none are really good options and one must rely on the pass.  I did enjoy the challenge of trying to make the best of my limited hand of cards often changing my plans based on what I was passed, but that just made the game feel very tactical as one continued on the initial choices for the overall strategy in the game.  (A convoluted way of saying that it appears players will focus on a few districts as their overall strategy and then work them tactically as the game progresses.)  Trajan felt a bit more open-ended and the mancala mechanism left the player more in control of action choices.

I fear a few things.  One, that the seating order at the table could create a bit of oddness based on the same person always handing cards to the same other person -- perhaps have that alternate left/right or some such?  Two, that regardless of direction, there's going to be a fair amount of chaos here.  Still, an interesting game that'll certainly bear more playings.

UPDATE: I had considerably more fun playing again, this time with three players.  I think that'll be my preferred mode for this one.  Solid.

This one could go either way. I've played twice (but with 18 months in between so had completely forgotten the rules) and have a long way to go in developing good strategies. I worry that if played too often, card familiarity would make it less 'fresh' and challenging, but, from reading other comments, there is a good chance that the opposite will occur, leading to a deeper game.
Also I love the artwork and the way the boards fit together for the different number of players.

22-02-2015. Rated after 1 play. Notre Dame is the first Feld game I genuinely enjoyed a lot.

Each round 3 cards are available that you can pay 1 gold to get a special ability and which also show an amount of rats (more on these later). The players then draw three cards, they keep one and pass the two others, and all other players do the same. Players then play the cards in subsequent 'turns', all cards 'activate' one of the actions on the board, and you may put a cube on them from your storage, or move one from another action space you put cubes on previously. You then may take the action of a strength equal to the number of cubes on that space. The spaces allow you to get cubes from the supply, get money, get VPs, drive a carriage around to get chips with VPs/or abilities. 

The last two actions protect against rats, slowing rats down or reducing the number of rats you have had in total. If you ever reach the end of the 'rattrack' on the board (9 rats), you lose 2 VPs and one of your cubes at the highest location dies.

I really, really like the game. It's drafting with a focus (what do I want to get this round) and penalty (rats). You build an engine, which I like, to make the most VPs (can't really care for those). But I, really, really liked this game. Are their downsides, I didn't like the artwork which was a bit bland.. nor the central focus of the notre dame, as it doesn't really impact the game as much as you might think.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I only rate this one high because of the fact that it has drafting, predating the big growth of this mechanic in 7 Wonders and Sushi Go. But the action drafting is just not that interesting (and one action - the "take 1 gold/1 cube/kill rat" - just always seems sub-optimal compared to other options).  It's just a bit too dry for me, lacking much fun factor, with little in the way of player interaction or multiple victory paths.

Good game.  Area control with character/action selection and card drafting thrown in.  Not a lot of player interaction.  This game is multi-player solitaire, but that is not a bad thing.  I rated it a little low because I think the game can become one dimensional with players saving money and fighting over control for Notre Dame.

--Jun2007-- The 7 is a rating after a single trial game.  It seems to me that the game needs some investigation before it arrives at a permanent score:  there's quite a bit going on here, but familiarity with the possibilities seems important to producing an appropriate strategy.  If I can get it to the table regularly, I could well become significantly better disposed toward it.
--Jan2008-- While it still seems like a fine game, if I'm going to grab an alea I'm aiming for Taj Mahal, Puerto Rico, Princes of Florence and In the Year of the Dragon before Notre Dame.

Interesting and solid but not exceptional game in the Luis XIV (which I consider to be a very average, abstract game) mold: trade certain resources for other resources. Action selection is a bit like Citadels (pick one, give the others to the left).

However, there seem to be issues. Like Puerto Rico, this is a screw your left hand neighbour, and hope your right doesn't screw you.
And the random cards can sometimes really hurt you, when two cards you need come up at the same time (of which you may only keep one).

Notched a further point for rather poor component quality: my main boards warp, and I've got 10  tokens with ripped edges or split card board.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Excellent game. Many paths to victory. Good balance of strategy, tactics and chance. Cards come up at random, but since the deck is small, and you know how many times a particular card will be seen/used, so you can plan your future moves (to some extent).

I had high hopes for this game but at least after the first game it wasn't that exciting. I think it will be better after a few plays when the character cards become more familiar and they can be used to full advantage. 12.6.2007 This game has many different strategies to choose from and needs adaptability. I can imagine it can become repetitive in the long run but after two games I'm ready to play again. 19.11.2008 I like the game but it could be a tad shorter. There is not enough variance coming from the one changing card from round to round.

A game with an interesting draft mechanism. Besides you can - and of course you have - to decide the right actions to win. The beautiful gameboard is variable depending on the number of players. There are many strategies possible ... although I only tried out a 2-player-game. The more players the better I think. For me a very good Feld game (ranks at fourth place after "Trajan", "Amerigo" and "Macao").

EDIT: got the game in exchange with "Ave Caesar"; finally traded it for "King of Siam" (Histogames).

Ahh Notre Dame, what else can I say that hasn't already been said? Just a super unique game from Master Feld. It is very streamlined, smooth, but super harsh if you don't handle your business. The modular board accommodates to different player counts which is cool. It plays very well with 2, there's good interaction through the card drafting, plays fast and offers lots of different paths to victory. One of my favorites from my favorite designer.

I loved this game at first--especially because of the card drafting, but I've seen too many cases of the winning player being handed the game by the player to their right.

Picked up like new and unpunched from Craiglist. This is a great game with so many variables.  With limited cubes at your disposal, the choices you make are critical and have repercussions for later turns.

A perfectly serviceable mix of well-known mechanics.

Turns out that this is a hidden gem of a game. A lot of tense decisions through out the whole of game.

Do you let the rat plague breach and lose prestige points and game board influence, but possible get more prestige points in another area or do I try and mitigate the plague?

How do I get more influence cubes so I can decrease rat plague by influencing the Hospital or Park areas?

Do I have enough money so I can go to Notre Dame for extra prestige points, or as bribe for my 3'rd card action?

Lots of decisions like these, a well crafted game with a unique modular game board that morphs based upon 3, 4, 5 players.

The full-on Euro treatment of the pass-draft mechanic.  Not sure every option was balanced, and the focus on the cathedral is strangely unfocused.  Enough moving parts that replayability is not an issue, but I haven't been drawn back to it.

RATING: 7.5
First impression.  Very good solid Euro.  A _little_ solitairey I guess - but competing for shared points and most importantly the card drafting (which is v important and also very cool) keeps some player interaction in the game so not purely a race against the others.

Looks like there are plenty of routes to take to victory and plenty of choices to be made along the way which is always good.  Play time should be down to about 1.25 - 1.5hrs after a couple of plays I reckon.  Being swamped by plagues of rats and trying to fight off the infestation is hilarious.

The player mats/board are very neat indeed.  Probably nothing too earth shattering mechanics-wise, but they all seemed to fit together seamlessly to give a polished result.  Overall, I guess I wasn't super duper excited by it, but I did still enjoy it quite a lot.  Worth a look.

Has gone up in my rankings after a few more plays.

I'm fairly disappointed in Notre Dame. I expected to like it very much, it sounded like just my kind of game. After my first play I was very frustrated with the action selection mechanism, as it's difficult to do anything that you really want to do on purpose. The draft mechanic ties you into your right hand opponent (and his right hand opponent) in such a way that if they want to do the same thing you want to do, then you're pretty much out of luck - you need to switch your strategy. Of course you can't know that's the case until you're 1/3 of the way through the game! Because you always pass left, the game encourages people to settle into a strategy that's not disrupted by the players to their right, and stick to it. There's little means by which to hinder any other player (defensive draft) because you only draft 3 cards at a time, and you can't really afford to tank your own play to keep someone else from having a good action.

I feel like this game would be better if the draft changed directions each round, or if you drafted more cards at a time, or if instead of drafting at all you played the cards like Kreta, one at a time from the whole supply... something.

Edit: Played again, it seems better, but I'm still annoyed by parts of it. I could see liking this game now, but I don't yet.

Edit again: I've played again, and I've started to "get it." I like the game now :)

Edit a third time: I played some 2p tonight, and I don't like it much, mostly because when you draw the Notre Dame card you almost have to draft it, even if you want the other cards. Unless your opponent is neglecting income, you are handing them tons of points if you don't.

Action choices with drafting. Mediocre game with almost zero interaction (save for the tiny bit inherent in drafting cards). They could have at least structured the workers at the end of the turn just like the tough choices in In the Year of the Dragon, to increase interaction. As it is, it's a fun efficiency exercise, but not very satisfying when I want a real game. It feels like you're playing against the board, not the players.

Not too bad for 2 players, because your efficiency exercise means more, and there is a bit more strategy with the card drafting.

I finally got to play this one.  A very good Feld with some similar mechanics from other of his games.  The penalty for going over 9 rats is pretty stiff - losing 2 pts AND a cube from the most populous area, but that's one thing I like about Feld.  You're going around trying to collect pts, cubes, etc, but if you neglect the potential penalties, they can really come back to get you.  I enjoyed it and it's one that I'd certainly not mind playing again.

Notre Dame is a draft-driven game which distills the typical Feld experience into a brisk hour. Players are given individual city quarters to manage, and gradually increase the efficiency of actions by investing influence in them. Most elements in the game – resource juggling, multiple VP sources and rat penalties – will be familiar territory for contemporary gamers, although I'd like to think that this game set the tone for Feld's later designs.

The board is rather interesting too, and its unique shape actually plays a minor role in the game. Notre Dame is neither deep nor innovative, but the relative simplicity and snappy playing time makes its quite an attractive title.

[2 plays] 4 player and 2 player. After 2 games I can safely say that most people won't feel much control in their first game. The learning curve is too steep and the game moves too quickly. However, after a game or two, I think most people won't feel like the game is playing them anymore, and they will start to enjoy figuring out how to play the game most efficiently. I enjoyed the second game even though I was still challenged a few times my self inflicted dilemmas.

This is another quality and beautiful Alea production. The game is a mish mash of mechanics seen in many other games. It doesn't click for me, and I think it will be forgettable in the long run.

Most recent play 6-17-07 with Garrett.

RATING: 7.5
Very playable eurogame that helpe restore some respectability to the Alea line (after the dud that was Rum and Pirates). This time, players are drafting cards in order to activate various sectors on the board. Each sector offers either VPs, money and other ways to score influence. There are a fair few things to manage but the decision tree is small (you are essentially only drafting two cards to play each turn). Still, there are agonising moments and the whole package clips along at a good pace. Probably worth a few plays before it gets stale.

The problem with this game was that I won and had about twice as many points as any of the other players at the end of the game -- without having a single microscopic clue about what I was doing!  

That Notre Dame card sure is powerful.  It seems as if that one card can ruin the entire game.  I haven't felt that way since I played Roma with its very powerful Forum cards.  Let's see. Who was that designed that game?  Oh, never mind.

UPDATE:  I played it again and won a four-player game.  Now I'm 2-0.  The Notre Dame card strategy seems to work, but you have to supplement a lot of bank cards into that strategy too.  I like it more now that I understand it better.

An amazingly done card drafting game with area activation. Gather as much Prestige as possible by sending your workers to parks, banks or the titular cathedral, all the while avoiding the plague and bribing nobles for bonuses. The game lets you get ahead on points early in the game or slowly bid your time and gather resources to score massive points in the second half of the game, which is pretty much the staple of Stefan Feld's games. Overall, I wish I could play this more often as it scales fantastically well to any number of players.

Valahogy olyan érzésem volt a játék alatt, mint egy Puerto Rico parti közben. Azaz, ez a játék is érzésem szerint eltalálta azt a nehéz határt, amin egy játék élvezhető, nem túl egyszerű, de nem is túl bonyolult és sok jó mechanizmus szerepel benne. Nagyon jól sikerült játék a Notre Dame. Fairy Tale, 7 Wonders féle draftolós kártyamechanizmus, XIV. Lajos féle megkenhető szereplők és saját területen levő többségi játék. Nagyon jól összegyúrt egészet alkot ez, amiben ténylegesen sok út vezet a győzelemhez mégis áttekinthető, jól kigondolhatóak egyes taktikai lépések. Tetszik, hogy a konfrontáció a lapoknál és a városban levő üzenetek megszerezésénél megjelenik, de nem túl erős szinten, hisz mindenki a saját kerületét fejleszti. Nagyon jól működött hárman a játék, valószínűleg négyen lehet a legjobb, de biztos vagyok benne, hogy ketten és öten is hasonló élményt ad. Nagyszerű játék, a kivitele is hibátlan és a játékidő is tökéletes.

[2011-05-28]
Egy ponttal csökkentem a pontszámot, mert van esély a játékban a patkányinvázió és pénzhiány hibájába esni, ahonnan a rövid játékidő miatt nem tud a játékos kikecmeregni és már csak a biztos vesztés tudatában próbálkozhat. Ettől függetlenül még mindig nagyon jó játéknak tartom.
9->8

[2014-06-09]
Pont megy vissza. Amióta szabálymagyarázat közben különösen felhívom a figyelmet a patkánysávra azóta senkit nem érintett olyan szinten a dolog, hogy emiatt tönkremenjen a játékélménye. Illetve simán bevállalható akár több mínusz is, amitől függetlenül meg lehet nyerni a játékot.
8->9

[2017-03-19]
Továbbra is Feld mester legjobb játékának tartom. Rengeteg út vezet a győzelemhez, rendkívül fontos a szomszédaid taktikájának figyelése és ennek kihasználása a tőlük várható lapok által. Minden játékosszámmal tökéletesen működik, amit eddig próbáltam. Ketten még nem játszottam.

I might rate this as Feld's best. Yes, Trajan and Bora Bora offer more depth (and length); and Castles and In the Year of the Dragon are damn good, too. But Notre Dame, with its brutal decisions (ala card drafting) and its shorter play time bring it bubbling to the top. A perfect game.

This is a highly tactical, build-your-machine, risk management system.  That said, I like those kinds of games.  If you want any significant strategy I'd say look elsewhere as your game play is completely dictated by the cards.  I tend to like games that you can play by the seat of your pants.  This game is really all about doing the best you can under the conditions you are given, I'd imagine that this could be really frustrating if you were expecting anything more. 

It was readily apparent at the beginning of the game that you were going to be thrown to the wind and with this it feels like you are continually facing little challenges, to keep the ship on course.  

Sadly, the only interaction is the carriage race and the Magic: The Gathering/Fairy Tale card draft. It seems that people are really going crazy with the card passing mechanic this year, this is yet another variation on the theme, which is a more controlled form of drafting.  Still I prefer this 2006/7 take on drafting to the old Venture mechanic that has now been beaten into submission (See: Ticket to Ride/Thurn & Taxis/Pillars of the Earth).

I'm a little bummed that there is no Quasimodo.

UPDATE: Downgraded this to a 7. The more I play this the more annoyed I am with the endgame.  You are forced throughout the game to fashion your "strategy" on what cards you are given, but when you get to the endgame there is often nothing worthwhile that you can do.  It feel anti-climactic to me, and frankly it is irritating.  I still like the game, but it just feels like the plug is pulled.  I wish there were other points to award, even if it were a pittance at the end of the game so that there was something useful you could do with useless cards.

With three players there is more intention to the cards you are passing as you can effect every player, with four your cards only effect the next two downstream.  I prefer the three player game.  Of course, the carriage competition increases with more players, a toss up?

UPDATE: I am compelled to return to this game. While it may not be perfect, I find that it is a joy to play.  Who knows, the rating may start climbing higher again...

A very streamlined engine builder that is easy to explain and plays in around 2 hours with 3. I loved the select and pass mechanic of action cards. Reminded me a bit of hearts. I also was fond of the player cards that are not selected just by one person but available to all. Take that Puerto Rico and all your clones! Some tough choices here especially trying to maintain the balance of optimizing your machine versus keeping those pesky rats as bay. Interested to see how this scales to 4 (my hunch is good, no pun intended) and 5 (i feel it would be a tad chaotic but willing to give it a go). All in all, a nice comeback for Mr. Feld after what I hear is a dreadful game in Rum and Pirates.

It's a economic resource management type game with hand management and set-collection stuff going on, too.

The board is very cool, designed to be put together for 2-5 players. Each player is largely playing in their own area, although they also have a wagon that can move around through all areas collecting tokens; and the central area (Notre Dame) is accessible to all. Play is driven by the cards and cubes. There are 9 areas corresponding to the 7 sectors of each player's area, 1 to Notre Dame, and 1 to move their Friend token. You get cards by drafting 3 at a time: draw 3 each round (3 rounds per period; score at end of period); keep 1 and pass the remainder to the left; repeat. Then, you'll play 2 of the 3 (in turn order). Cards generally allow you to place your cube into the corresponding sector. When you do so, you get the benefit (e.g., get gold, get VP, reduce #rats, etc.) of the sector; these generally improve as the #cubes there increases. After 2 cards played, can pay 1 gold to hire 1 person (cards set up; different 3 cards each period) who gives you some benefit. Then, resolve rats: these last cards have 0-4 rats on them; everyone adds the total # of rats to their count. If they get above 9, they lose 2 VP and 1 cube. Also score Notre Dame: each cube their gets VP = 12/(total # cubes there).

Repeat all this for total of 9 turns. Most VP at end wins!

There's a lot going on but the game plays quite quickly (69 min for 5 newbies). There are multiple paths to victory, depending on how you want to allocate your cubes. There may be some problems with luck of the card draw, but you will eventually have a choice of 3 from all your own cards, as well as what's passed to you, so the randomness is mostly manageable. Plays especially well with 3, but really works with any number. Definitely worth having!

On a first play, I had little idea about what I should do. This game sounded pretty simple from the rules explanation, but being my first game of this type ever played, it felt a bit overwhelming. There are lots of things happening in the game. I liked the idea of having own "district" to expand and a place to put up some competition (Notre Dame).
The board looks awesome no matter how many players play. The tiles look great when put together with varying centre piece. The drafting of action cards was a bit confusing at the beginning, choosing the right card so that you won't help too much your oponents is a tricky thing.
This game requires lots of plays to really get into, but it's really nice piece with some interesting strategies.

I like it, but it's unmemorable to the point where I need  rules refresher every time.  I think there are too many moving parts, where if they got rid of one or two and tightened it up I would like it better.  A little too formulaic for me to rank amongst the greats. Just take ideas used in other games, mix them up a bit, paste on a new theme, and voila!

Stefan Feld is one of my favorite designers.  I like so many of his games because of their incredibly complex and clever mechanics even though they are typically quite light on theme.  This one is no exception.

In this game each player is controlling a burrough surrounding the Notre Dame cathedral.  Each player has a deck of 9 cards and at the start of each round they draw 3 cards, pick one and pass the other two.  Each player will end up with 3 cards, one of each player's color, and play 2 of those.  Each represents an action from collecting money, to points, to managing the rat population in your burrough.  After each player has taken 2 actions they can purchase the ability of one of 3 person cards and then they have to increase the rat population in their burrough.  If the rat population gets too high they lose points and influence (action) cubes in an area.

The game lasts until the players have gone through their deck 3 times, so nine rounds.  The rounds are incredibly quick making this a very quick game.  Probably about an hour with the full complement of 5 and under with fewer players.  I love the clever interaction of giving away your action cards and planning your turns around your neighbor's leftovers.  And the rules are straightforward and the rounds quick enough to make this a very accessible game.

It isn't his most stellar design (I had high expectations since this is the game credited most with Feld's fame) but it is still good and a game I enjoy playing.

繼勃根地城堡之後，再次被SF的設計所驚艷。
將各種長短期投資用工人放置的方式呈現在玩家城區的圖版上，又巧妙地用輪抽限縮每輪的選擇。此外，汽車收包裹除了有逐漸困難的投資特性之外，也誘導玩家不斷去「欣賞」整個地圖，遊戲體驗大大加分。最後黑死病的設計除了增加隨機性，也讓玩家不時需要在得分、賺錢之餘，到醫院殺老鼠買保險。總結而言，各種選擇除了效益差別很大，有多條路線可走之外，也在因為輪抽、跑地圖而保有很高的互動性。

It's a Stefan Feld game but has W. Kramer all over it. It's elegant, simple to play and not very confrontational.  The major problem is that it has almost none interaction.

Besides Notre Dame (at the end of each turn) and the bonus chits, it's very  dry of interaction, and even these ones are a bit "punched" to fit.

edit #1
After playing it a couple times more I now think that it is a much more interactive game than it seems at first. Very well designed and one of the best games from 2007.

Finally, another good game in the alea big-box series. This isn't going to blow anyone away like Puerto Rice, Princes or Taj Mahal did, but it's a very decent game in its own right. I prefer playing this with two or three players, since more tends to drag the game. Including BSW, I've almost played this 100 times by now, but it still manages to offer interesting choices.

Rats!!  Another dry-as-a-mouthful-of-sand Euro-style game that I just couldn't get into.  After playing the game I had to check this site so see what the thematic concept of the game actually was.  A lot of games effectively incorporate the element of very limited options during a player's turn in order to generate tension and excitement, but the limitedness (is that a word?) of the options in "Notre Dame" just left me frustrated.  So yet again, I find myself stymied by the BGG ratings.  I also found the game to be rather visually unappealing - who is that poser who's trying to be Quasimodo?  Notre Damn!

[1 play] Initial reaction rating. I enjoyed my first play of this game.  I do want to play this again soon.  I thought that it was a decent calculating game where it is all about optimizing your actions.  The player interaction came in the form of passing cards to your neighbor, racing to get the markets, and splitting points at Notre Dame section of the board.  So better player interaction than something like Thurn and Taxis I thought.  The one thing though, because of the card play, that limits what you can do and I think that one hand it makes the game quicker because there is less choice, but on the other hand it keeps the game from being as deep as maybe I would like.

Feb 23, 2013 Update: Traded away. Wife really does like it and will pick it up again when 10th anniversary edition is released. Supposed to include the expansion which will help with my replayability concern.

Pretty Fun, and do like how push/pull of when to making certain decisions. Biggest draw back I see is a lack of variety from the base game. Sure how the cards come out will be different but you will see the same cards every game. So lower score based on perceived replay-ability.

I was moved to rate this by a review describing the game as "not just another cube pusher".

What?!?  It is EXACTLY just another cube pusher.  You have 27 actions, and each of them involves choosing to do one of a set of proscribed things that convert thingies into thingies.  At the end of the game, whoever has the most victory thingies wins.  The theme is wafer-thin, and the only semi-interesting parts of the game are the rats and the carriages.  The core of the game's uniqueness, the MTG-like "drafting" of roles, is pretty silly, with certain cards almost always dominating others and so the hope is that you don't get too many of the powerful cards in one hand and your neighbor to the right does.  Woo hoo.

The one good thing the game does, and what may lure me back to it at some point, is that it is short enough that the classic "build your engine, then run your engine" strategy isn't necessarily the ideal one.  Jam today can be a reasonable approach.  So I give it marks for not being easily decipherable, but the actual game mechanics are pretty dreary with no real theme to hang them on.  I've never seen a game more in need of a "space empire" re-theming.

In the foot foot library, owned by Funpaul. I like this one quite a bit. It does feel like multi player solitare, but so what. Sometimes you need to be able to play a game of optimazation and follow a strategy. I like how it feels very relaxing to play, there is a great deal of screwage in the cards that you pass, but you can pretty much overcome a bad round. Very much looking forward to my next game of this.

RATING: 7
Extremely clever board design that changes to suit the number of players. Played one five player game. Plenty of choices and an interesting 'discard two cards to your neighbour' mechanism that puts me in mind of Canal Grande or San Marco. I really enjoyed managing the choices.

The only possible downsides are that it is really an abstract as the Notre Dame theme is tacked on and I would say, that while it is only a middle-weight, it's more of a gamers game. But these are all plusses in my book.

Another worker placement Euro game of very high quality, which it has to be to stand out in an overcrowded genre. It's set in 14th Century Paris where you play the head of a family controlling a borough made up of seven areas. Each area brings bonuses to you by placing influence within them e.g the bank brings you money, the hospital cures the effects of the plague, the residence allows you to increase the amount of influence available to you etc. The goal is to accumulate the highest amount of prestige (victory points), which is determined by where you apportion your influence. Excellent balance of play leaves you having to make full use of every decision you're posed with and you cannot waste a single move. One of the very best games of the worker placement genre.

A fun game with many ways to score.  Before I purchased it my wife and I read the theme and yawned.  In spite of that it works.  It's very fun and goes quick with two as well.  The draft adds the randomness to it that makes it replayable but doesn't give it a questioning luck factor.  You learn to read the cards and use them to your advantage at just the right moment.  There are a lot of strategies to try out because of this.

Update : Just played with the expansion cards.  Very nice and smooth.  Gives the game a lot of replayability.  Recommended (except nurse...she sucks). We play the two player variant where you draft one card of a neutral deck as your third card. 

Expansion :  Extra characters from Treasure Chest

23-Jul-08: What a great time I had at the game club last night! 2 games of Race of the Galaxy, and 1 game of Notre dame (first time playing). Won all of them! :-D Although I must admit that my strategy in ND was "exploit the poor choices that Carlos on my right keeps making".

23-Apr-10: Just played Notre Dame. Man, i suck at this game! It's a good game although too dependant on your card draws. I had a plan going in, only to be completely stuffed by the order I received my own cards. Eg. I didn't get my Hospital (kill 1 Rat + Reduce Rat increase by 1 per cube) till Round 3. Of course, the guys/girl on my right refused to pass me any Hospital cards. And I told myself that I'd play a cube into Notre Dame within each of the 3 rounds, but man, that was a commitment :-p It was probably the only thing that saved me from being dead last though. Anyway, I got overrun by rats twice last game. That's the most I've ever been overrun :-p

Dang thing's been sittin' on my shelf for 2 years now, maybe more.  I played a 2 player game of it twice.

It's a medium euro with very straight-forward rules, smooth flow and low-level analysis paralysis--for those prone to it.  I love the Feld avoided AP by only really providing about 3 choices at all times.

It gets a 9 and not a 10 from me because, it feels a bit dated and theme (as usual for most euros) doesn't come through strongly, but it's not bad.  The rat scale, central cathedral, Quazi modo marker and the carriage piece give it some nice thematic elements.  

If my wife can get over horrifying difference in our scores from the first play, I would love to try this again with her--or friends... Or anyone.

Surprise! This Feld game (much like the following game) is a "negative" battle game - you have to strive to drive your VP engine while working to limit the constant negative events that try to hurt you. If you don't like this sort of "swim against the tide" game, skip this one. Otherwise its not a bad game. I think I prefer In the Year of the Dragon's game play to the card drafting mechanics here. I need a few more plays to be sure.

A Feld game I like! I can see the future Feld in Notre Dame, but he hadn't yet graduated to the "point salad" school of design. Notre Dame does contain multiple ways to score points, but the game, overall, is much less fiddly and allows for inter-player interaction through the carriages and card draft. The rat/plague mechanic was enjoyable. The threat of point and worker loss added to the already tight game economy for an overall tense experience. There is still the feel of multi-player solitaire, with private point optimization being the primary focus of the game; however, the game was streamlined enough to make it an enjoyable experience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I think Feld is becoming one of my favorite designers.  The booster draft mechanism adds a fair amount of strategy to the game, as does the random card draw each round.  You know which nine actions you will get, just not the order.  You have to balance money, workers, and rats all at the same time, which makes for a nice tense game.

Of course I was wrong - it's more difficult than it looks!
And more importantly it's very replayable. Just doesn't get boring.

Lowered to 7.
I knew from the beginning that the game is solvable but I did not expect to be that easy. After 5 games  I get 75-80 pts every time ignoring what other people are doing. I will give it more chances though - it is fun&relaxing.

The game has a relatively flat engine (converting from resources to VPs). It's also mostly just a card game. Despite these points it works and it's fun. Rating: 8

Got this for Christmas (2014).  Certainly very pretty, and seems to be a nice, smooth game (based on some testing play-throughs with myself).  Finally got one game with a real live person, who thought it was really excellent, although a lot to learn and keep track of.  Hopefully we'll get some more games, and the next one will be even better.

Not very original game although I really like the cumulative aspect of rewards when adding cubes to the buildings. Still I'm not very sure how much there's luck in this game, I fear too much. Another thing that bothers me is that I don't feel controlling my own play; instead it feels like my play is controlled by player on my right. Nevertheless, it is a rather good game and so far I enjoy playing. Just not the masterpiece I was expecting.

On the first glance this feels a bit too much like multiplayer-solitaire.
But if played with more experienced players you really have to look out what cards to pass to the next player. I also like the components and graphics.
Also in my opinion you'll get an intense gamefeeling for the relatively short time you play.

Absolutely the top game in the first half of 2007. Choices are always difficult and the possible, viable paths to victory are many and varied. Balance seems excellent and the game moves along at a good pace. Not hugely innovative, but like Caylus it's fine-tuned into a precision instrument that's going to make some good noise on the gaming scene.

It will not take more than five minutes to explain the rules - although one might want to consult them to find out what different buildings and persons do. Despite its simplicity it is a rather complex game with a lot of choices to make. Luck plays a role as well, but not so much that I am bothered by it.

RATING: 10
Really great game, one of my favorite (maybe my favorite overall) Feld games, and a game that I'm always willing to play.

I think this game has a lot of interesting game play for a relatively short play-time (should be ~30 minutes for a 3 player game as long as they've all played before).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Played once 4-player. Lots of options to gain victory points, yet it always seems like you want to do more than just two actions each turn and the actions you want to do are unavailable. The game leaves room for very clever play, so should have lots of replayability. Should play nearly as well with all players (3-5) since the game is mostly solitaire in nature.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Notre Dame is spread a little bit too thinly across a very broad area; even literally!  The modular interlocking boards--a nifty gimmick--bear little fruit in actual gameplay.  They obscure a multiplayer solitaire experience with virtually no direct conflict.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Nice action selection game with a slight feel of city building, but actually the theme is really thin. The rat/ plague management is interesting. As usual with alea games, a careful balance of development and resources is important. Very few player interaction (you pass on cards you don't want to use and can pick up some victory point tiles from the board which are accessable for all players). Rating after one play.

This is one of my favorite Felds. I really like the way the drafting adds a layer of read-your-neighbor fun. I also like the multiple ways to build up your tableau. And the rats; what a horrible, wonderful mechanism. I would play this medium-weight Euro any time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Really solid euro that plays well with three in well under an hour. Not a brainburner, but there's still lots to think about and multiple paths to victory. Resources (influence and money) are tight and there is the impending threat of rat plagues to contend with, meaning there's always something to do and not enough to do it with. Player interaction is mainly in the form of passing or holding cards, resulting in little direct confrontation. Initial rating of 8.

10 plays: Yep, it remains firmly in the category of a solid euro for three that plays in about an hour. Stays at 8.

Rating has gone up from 7.5 to an 8.

This is now one of the most played games in my collection and I really enjoy it.

It scales well from 2-5.  

I look forward to playing with the new characters from the Alea Treasure Chest

Update:  Rating stays the same. I have played this primarily as a two-player, but have lately been playing more with three.  It really is better with more than two. 

Update: My wife and I can now play this in about 25-30 minutes including setup. This is a pretty awesome "filler"

The expansion definitely spices things up.

I think there is more interaction than it  gets credit for, particularly with more than two. The card passing and the race for messages definitely means you have to pay attention to your opponents.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 2
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 2
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3

The rat plague mechanic is great, the money and cubes are tight, and even the worst spot on the board is really just a safety valve - and a necessary one at that.

The board is really cool - the way it reconfigures based on the number of players is very clever.

First Impression:

A quick strategy game, that offers a variety of strategies, enough replayability and little luck.

I love the flow of the game, as it plays fast but every decision you have to make is crucial and most are also hard. In addition the draft mechanic in combination with a couple directly interactive actions make this game more interactive than most euro games.

Card drawing may occassionaly ruin your plans so luck is a factor, however the game tends to balance in its 9 short rounds so that makes it a minor one. Some actions appear poorer than others, but I'm not really sure about this yet. The theme is working better than most classic euros, but it's still not enough for me.

Overall, I like this game, and I expect that my rating will rise the more I play.

While this is somewhat of a combination of a bunch of already-used mechanics in a new way to make a new game, I like the way it works.  In fact, I like it more than many of its predecessors, so I can justify a high place on my wishlist for it.  While it may not be the type of game that is still played a lot a decade from now, I think there are plenty of fun games in it before it even starts to get old.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Delightful game of card drafting and efficiency.  There are entirely way too many options to be proficient in all of them, so the game really forces you to make decisions.  The card drafting makes this fun because the path you would like to choose may not be available.  There is a whole lot of game here in a very short amount of time.   Really epitomizes the multiple paths to victory description.

Played twice with girlfriend.  This may be ultimate bang per second kind of game with 2.  Rating should be soon trending up.

3 is the definite sweet spot, and this is a nice middle weight high decision game that really fits nicely into my collection and am always happy to play.

I'm looking forward to exploring this game many more times in the months and years to come.

Played a pre-release demo at BGG.Con '06.  Had one aborted game about two turns in so we could squeeze in a fifth.  The rules hadn't been finalized, and we had to stop a couple of times to look at the translated rules or actually e-mail the designer.  The people demoing the game were split on whether or not it was playable as it was.  Valerie Putman was determined to get through it, and Brian Yu kept shaking his head as if to say "It's not finished and not really playable."  The game was okay, but I couldn't quite understand the theme or the bonus structure.  The modular board design is outstanding, though, as it can be configured with three, four, or five individual play areas.

As a Feld fan, I've been a bit remiss in not trying this game out. In my defense, it came out a few years before I got into the hobby and it's out of print. I finally got the chance to play it, and...

This is a really clever game. I really liked it a lot. Like most Feld games the neat mechanics are what really make the game. Every player has a personal deck of nine cards. You draw three, keep one and pass the remainder, drafting your opponent's cards. You will end up with a card from the ones you drew and one from each of your two neighbors to the right. And you can play two of the three cards you get. There are three rounds in each phase, and three rounds in each phase. So you'll see all the cards in your deck three times, which means you'll never be completely blocked out of an action each phase.

Playing cards involves either placing a cube from your personal supply on your board, or moving a cube around on your board (the former is usually preferable). Coins are largely used to hire one of the three employee cards that are available each round. They do various cool things but they also bring rats with them. The game is largely about avoiding getting too many rats, while getting cubes, coins and VPs.

This is a game of tough choices. You'll always want to do more than you can, and choosing what you need most can be agonizing! The onslaught of rats can be brutal, so you'd best be prepared. The random employees that come out and the random draw/draft mean that every game is going to be different.

RATING: 8
Interesting worker placement game where action cards are drafted between players at the start of the turn and the effect of workers placed is cumulative. The plague mechanic is also fun as each turn players need to ensure the level does not rise above 9 lest they get penalised! Seems as though there are different ways to win. Whilst I appreciate that a lack of text on cards makes the game more universal it would have been helpful to have a little more text support on the cards/board but not a serious gripe.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I've sort of enjoyed it so far. It's odd having the cubes be such a precious resource, but it works out well. There's good tension and unique decisions to be made. I like the balance between the rewards for specialization and the need for diversification. The decisions are often non-obvious, and even choosing whether or not to get plagued isn't always clear. However, there is pretty low interaction, it ends up being more puzzlish than gamish.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
I nice new look at role/ability selection. You are constantly faced with choices of between one out of a set of ability options. The game is fairly light - similar in weight to Citadels.

This game is much easier to learn by actual play, as opposed to reading the manual yourself. The game fits in an hour if you move quickly and allow turn overlap to the point of almost having simultaneous actions.

Notre Dame shares the drafting that I loved so much in Fairy Tale.

The players take on the roles of the heads of influential families in Paris at the end of the 14th century. In the shadow of the Notre Dame cathedral, the players compete for prosperity and reputation. Each family controls one of the 3 -5 boroughs that surround the site of Notre Dame. As head of his family, each player tries, through clever use of his action cards, to advance the power and prestige of his family, but penalties are assessed those who do not take care of the health of the people who live in their borough. The player with the most prestige at the end is the winner.

If you like action selection games like Pillars Of The Earth and Agricola (like I do), and you do not mind if there is relatively little interaction between players (although there is some), you have got to try this game. It is solid, it is streamlined, it is easily explained, it scales incredibly well from 2 to 5 players, and it plays in a short period of time. The drafting mechanism (similar to the excellent Fairy Tale) turns out to be very suitable for this type of game, making it possible to have a clear winner at the end of a session. Oh, and the board looks stunning when set up for 4 or 5 players. Cannot wait to play again.

An Alea game means a higher bar to pass. I think the game is not bad. The mechanics do seem a little hodge-podge and a mish-mash of area control as well as role selection. The only unique aspect of the game is the card selection followed by passing to the left rule. You generally will know the cards you can pick, but won't know which cards you will get from your neighbour. Also, you can play only 2 cards per round. That prevents you from having to play a "bad" card and hence wasting resources.
One other good thing of note is the lack of downtime. This game can flow pretty fast with few decisions to make each turn.
Not the best Feld design. ITYOTD is a lot better. I don't hate this game, nor am I terribly fond of it. That is why, I rate it a 6.5.

I can see why people like this one; it's Feld without feeling too much like Feld. There's some area influence, some card drafting, and some risk balancing. It feels like his usual package of luck mixed with tactics, but in a slightly different way than usual.

To an extent, it is very much your generic manage-your-own-fiefdom Eurogame- I was particularly struck by how the the odd shape of the districts, ingeniously devised to fit together for 2, 3, 4, or 5 players, was essentially a way of covering for the fact that these were essentially separate player mats.

That being said, I don't have anything against generic manage-your-own-fiefdom Eurogames, especially if they have enough subtlety, enough little gears and levers such that figuring the game out is enjoyable.  And it is with Notre Dame, and I expect will be so for awhile yet.

Sort of fun and sort of frustrating. I'm impressed by how you can do almost no planning for a game that has a strategic core. There's quite a lot of random and chaotic elements, but it all works well and is balanced enough that it doesn't bother so much. Very little interaction. The Notre Dame part is not very interesting with just three players, but I think the game length is probably perfect with three.

I was all set up to dislike this game.  Then I tried it.  Whoops!  My preconceptions were wrong.  Complaints of Euro fatigue and such that get leveled at this game seem exaggerated.  I enjoy the card drafting, and the specialist cards that come out are interesting enough.  This game demands flexibility, and that will almost certainly bother control freaks, but those of us willing to make contingency plans will enjoy the ebb and flow of the game.  The inevitable comparison to the similarly-themed [gameid=24480]: better gameplay, worse art, better tension.  For me, it's a no contest Notre Dame win.

Two games so far, the game feels very nice. It is fast to play once the rules are explained and the game round is quite simple with a very little amount of downtime.

I didn't catch the thematic goal of the game, we were just gathering points. While other players had some experience, I was a newbie and finished last. Looking forward to play more in the future. The game seems to have a little bit of learning curve, if you know what kind of cards there are coming, then you can better plan your moves. Of course you need to know what cards you have still left in your own deck, too.

Two more plays, played one after another with same 4 players, so the second was easier and faster. Thematic goal is still a mystery, but it was rather nice to play, anyway. I even had some long time tactics in my mind. Updated the rating from 6 to 7.

First play - 5 players. What a surprise this game was! I thought it was going to be a dry Euro game but what I got was a Euro game with card drafting and rats! As with the best Euro games there are multiple choices each turn and many paths to victory. You can't be everywhere at once but if you have a solid strategy and stick with it you can score well. The owner of the game blew us away as he never even got overrun by rats as the rest of us did at least once. I must have been doing something right because I finished second and I know I made several misplays. The random placement of the tokens on the map which you can drive to and collect and the three "hire" cards that come up each turn give the game a nice touch of randomness that I appreciate. The hires also bring the rats. Maybe ther will only be 1 rat this turn but maybe there will be 9!!! If yo udon't play for it they will hurt you. The end game was a bit of a mad rush to score victory points and if you planned well you can leave your opponents in the dust.

I love games where scoring VP points represents something. Building a city, perhaps. Conquering Europe, maybe. 

In Notre Dame, you spend lots of time fiddling with a puzzle in order to... score maximum VP points. The puzzle doesn't represent anything thematically meaningful - it is just a point-scoring exercise. As you get good at the game, your opponents will try to stop you scoring more VP points by devious drafting... or maybe moving their carriage into your space or something. Wahahahah! 

I've played the game three times, won three times, and I can't face playing it a fourth time. Yes, I may discover how to optimise the elusive 'park' strategy, but I could be doing something equally satisfying and meaningful for 30 minutes. Like taking my socks on-and-off fifteen times.

Our second games was 'Notre Dame', which I recall playing before where players try to establish the biggest presence in their district of Paris by acquiring prestige points, money, hospitals etc. all this whilst trying to prevent rat infestations within the city limits. I must confess I did not grasp the manner by which the rats were reduced so after the first turn, I was losing two victory points from that, and believed that hospitals reduced this every turn for each influence cube allocated? I felt a little hard done by as all the rat catchers were bought up before it was my turn as the player turn order didn't fall into place for me. I did at least secure one of every colour token from each player district. Pete H won as none of us put any influence in Notre Dame after the first turn so ten points straight away. I think the three of us missed a trick here as from then on in, Notre Dame was always contested, so no clean sweep. The bidding system makes this a very tactical game, which I like, so I will certainly play again and perhaps learn from my (significant) mistakes. Who put the rats out?

Played over 200 times... a fact that is certainly an endorsement of the game itself. It's perhaps not as strategically varied as all the bells and whistles suggest, but it is that sort of game that engages the gamer while being in its own way "light". Not as interesting as the heavier Alea pedigree but for what it is, a fine game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Players play as well-off Parisians in the 15th century who wish to improve the importance and appearance of the city quarter around the famous Notre Dame cathedral. The primary game concept is original but simple card play which players use to permanently improve their influence in the quarter. However, turn after turn, round after round, players must make choices that can have major implications. Because if one does one thing, then the other can't be done any more. Concentrating on one aspect means automatically ignoring another. Which, above all others, is particularly dangerous in the case of the gradually approaching plague...

I remember the buzz this game received when it first came out, and how it was described as a brutal sort of game because of players having to manage the rats.  Well, I've finally played it, after having played games like Age of Steam, Container, and Upon a Salty Ocean, and I just don't see this as a brutal game.  It's challenging enough, sure, but it's still Yet Another Euro to me.  I'd play it, but I probably wouldn't ask to play it, and I certainly don't see the need to own it.

Good game that involves considerations and the necessary decisions. The story is irrelevant, but makes the game just not too abstract. The passing of cards gives the game just that little bit extra.

I feel like Notre Dame has just the right amount of moving parts. Feld offers many actions, but deftly limits them with the card draw while adding spice with the draft. & good old plague to keep everyone honest!

RATING: 7
A solid Euro where you build a little economic point-making engine in your district of the city. There is a bit of luck involved, as you get passed cards from other players and you must play with them, and you may be forced to pass a card you really wanted.

Overall, a good Euro that seems to work 2-5, but nothing to be crazy about.

I like the tension between the desire to specialize and the need to diversify.  The card passing is a good touch (the game would work without it, which is interesting and odd, but it's clearly much better with it).  The plague is a nasty albatross once it starts, but in a fun way. I also very much like the pace and flow.

It's also rather interesting in that it avoids being overbalanced; you can fall behind with no hope through seemingly reasonable play.  Not actually reasonable, of course, but it's nice to see a euro without explicit balancing (cf. Rudiger Dorn, who I like, but who tends toward overbalance), where you're working without a net.  Better tension because of this (though it's going to punish newbies more than usual, a necessary tradeoff).

Does feel a bit samey, though, after ~10 plays (I've played it 20+ times). The Treasure Chest expansion helps address this, and I will never play without it.

Seems like a good game,   but something doesn't quite gel for me.   Maybe it's the randomness of the number of rats and the people to hire (I can never remember who's coming) coupled with the "what haven't people hired yet?" card counting aspect.  I definitely prefer it's "big brother" In the Year of the Dragon,  which was so sufficiently different that I didn't recognise the familial similarities until they were pointed out to me.

Either way, though, a good game.

I have played this twice and it didn't impress me much. I seem to be not much of a Stefan Feld guy. 

13/01/'17: Played again recently with four and it was interesting - I think it's a case of getting used to the idea of points salad, and looking for ways to maximize scoring each turn. The game was close with the Park being the difference (it seemed to me - I didn't use it at all). Keen to play again, so I've bumped my rating up.

29/05/'17: Notre Dame falls in between: it's too heavy to easily get to play and I don't like it with two, and when the opportunity to play it arises with 3 or 4 it's never the game I want to play (and decreasingly so with some new games in my collection). For this reason it's being squeezed out of my collection by other games that I consider of similar heaviness but which I prefer.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A very clever game in the Alea series, Notre Dame pits players against one another in France, working to gain prestige and wealth while avoiding the rats and plague.  There are several different strategic paths a player can take to win, and every turn of the game involves choices for each player.  The game moves along quickly and scales very well for 2-5 players.  Interesting, quick to learn, and fun to play!

Feld has a knack for giving you the feeling you can load up to throw a grenade at any time (double/triple-cogged rondel in Trajan etc) - for example, here those satisfying mid-to-end moments when shifting 1-3 cubes from one area to another brings a better point-scoring opportunity: Boom! 4 gold please.

Played several times face-to-face and on BSW (with 2 to 5 players). An interesting game, with quite a lot of tactical decisions. The randomness in the card draw does not bother me too much (knowing how to adapt to the cards which you draw and which get passed to you really is the key), nor does the possible unbalance between the various effects. The cleverness of the adjustable game board has to be noted - even though it is nothing else than a curious gimmick. After having tried the game with all the possible numbers of players, I think I prefer it with 3 (but 2 is very good as well, and the game remains enjoyable, though less easy to control, with more).

Lighter Feld game before he got into dice. Has some variation in message tokens and card draw. You have to roll with the punches to avoid getting plagued by rats and plan ahead by building up certain areas since the action becomes more powerful with more cubes.

[b]Preference in a Vacuum[/b]
Bank/Hospital > Park/Cube > Carriage/Advisor > Else

[b]Minstrel[/b]
More often than not this is how you get four cubes on Park. Look for him during A and B rounds. There's an outside chance to deposit two from Carriage, Cube, or Hotel to Hospital in A1-A2.

[b]Slowplay Advisor[/b]
Advisor is like a wild - free cube, free card. Once used however, he's not quite wild (can't repeat action) and he's his own cube. If he's stranded on Park, Hospital, Bank, or Cube he's effectively a dead piece, depending on your plans, so be careful.

[b]Bank[/b]
Bank is arguably better than Hospital because the point differential tends to be greater when you withhold Bank than Hospital from your opponent. Moreover, as with the Park you can Minstrel cubes to the Hospital because the incremental benefit is negligible, as opposed to Bank where you need each activation. +10 gold is a good target; know if/how it's going to happen before the C round.

[b]Extra Cubes Are Overrated[/b]
4 starting supply + 7/10 stock is enough for 4-Park, 3 Hospital, 3 Bank/Carriage with an extra to spare, plus Advisor. The extra cubes offer flexibility - and Monk is often the best Hiree present - but know what you need to make three groups of three for the C-round and what's superfluous.

[b]Hirees = Bank/Hospital[/b]
Barring Minstrel and high point Beggar King / Guild Master, try to focus your hirees on Bank and Hospital. Jester a random cube to Bank/Hospital, look for early A-round Bishop. Moneylender (and then some) is an acceptable substitute for Bank #4, Monk is your saving grace for passing Cube in favor of Bank/Hospital.

Again a Feld game, and one of his bests. Love the way you have to choose your actions, but also give your opponents some actions

I have only played this game once, and I definitely enjoyed it.  I'm not giving it a '7' though because I'm not sure how much replayability it will have.  Aside from the passing there is very little player interaction, so even with a strong mechanic it seems that it will get dull.
-------------------
After several more plays it has not gotten dull, but isn't particularly exciting either. I'm happy to play, but won't go looking for it either.

This game left us with our mouths hanging open: how a game with no player interaction, no real theme, and no real mechanics can garner a 7.7 average user rating and be in the top 50 games is beyond us!

RATING: 7.7
A really enjoyable game with a lot of tactics.  Definitely a very solid Feld title.  I wouldn't put it up there with his masterpieces but I enjoy the drafting mechanic and how the board is impacted by your decisions.  Resources are tight and you always feel like you need cubes, money, or to get your rat control lower and you can't do it all.  Highly recommended for a somewhat lighter Feld.

A fantastic game! A little lighter than the other two Felds I own (CoB, Macao, ItYotD), but equally streamlined, fast, easy, and fun.  The ease of play does not sacrifice depth in this game, as I often agonize over which action to take each turn.  Lots to think about packed into a quick game.  A definite winner and an instant hit with the wife!

Sin ser de los bombazos de Feld, es agradable de jugar y a dos funciona muy muy bien.

P.D.: Hay una casilla cuyo nombre no recuerdo que a partir del cuarto cubido duplica el beneficio que da, el propio Feld en una entrevista admite que es mejor a partir del tercero.

3 Plays on BSW, 1 F2F. At first impressed with the mechanics and inter-connectedness of the game, despite the coaches and drafting being the only true level of player interaction. But the more I played, the less interesting the game became. Based on the very discrete utility of the locations and easily evaluated worth of action cards and bribed personage cards, it seems that with more play, your turns and actions may be "dictated" by the available cards, leaving little room for differentiation. The faceted game board pieces are a marvel - rearranging them to adjust the space for multiple players is elegant and incredibly creative. I have reservations about the game's long term or F2F appeal... the BSW implementation is excellent, and takes all of 15-25 minutes, the F2F game seems to crawl along at a snail's pace.

Playing Notre Dame is kind of like juggling.  The delicate balance between influence cubes, money, rats and VP has to be constantly observed.  The randomness from the card drafting means you can't really plan ahead and must make the hard choices depending on the boroughs you get.  Same with the person cards, while they provide a kind of quick relief if you happen to run short on cubes or coins, or is in desperate need of an additional rat exterminated, but the VP opportunities they offer are often too important to be overlooked.

After playing a couple of times on BSW and seeing scores in the high 80's.  It seems that although there are multiple paths to victory, not all of them are equal and there is definitely one or two combination that will result in such a crushing win.  I'm not sure if that's a design flaw or not, and whether it will dampen my enjoyment for the game is still uncertain.

I'm not sure I like my Felds this light. 3 plays in and I'm not hankering to play it again soon. I like the tension that the rats create and it does have a solid depth-to-playtime ratio. I just feel it's missing something which I can't quite pinpoint. Still, a solid game though.

Nem érdemli meg igazából, h lehúzzam, de nekem vhogy nem tetszett. Minden Feldben találok vmit, amit ki lehet emelni, vagy legalábbis egy kicsit megfog, ebben már a szabálymagyarázat és a mechanikák sem hoztak lázba. Nekem ez eddig a lélektelen euró mintapéldánya, de ez nagyon szubjektív, nem kell vele foglalkozni.

After 2+ Plays: I love the drafting mechanic, and am waiting for a game that really does it well.  Notre Dame is not that game, but it is fun nonetheless.  With as little player interaction as it has I doubt it will ever be a favorite, but for now I don't mind playing it.

Hmm, I really liked the concept but the first game wasn't that great. I will update my rating when I played it again - it seems like there's a lot going on and on the same hand a lot that you can improve in your gameplay.
Really looks interesting to explore!
Update: 2nd game, sadly I have to say that it didn't hold up to my expectation. I really wanted to play again but even with a better knowledge of what was going on it didn't work much better. It seems like some strategies are clearly better than others, the feeling of a balanced game is gone for me at the moment. It's still fun to figure out what works best but I can see this game become a bit scripted.
Another bad thing is that you feel the lack of interaction more once you got the basic flow of the game down..
It stays a 6 for now, still a good game.

A very clean design that just barely avoids the trap that so many other European-style designs seem to fall in: They have no soul, and are merely an arrangement of gears that, when cranked, will spin effortlessly but move nothing more than themselves. 

The expansion, though small, is easily added in an increases the variance, which I welcome.

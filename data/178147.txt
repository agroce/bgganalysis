A bit of the charm from The Witcher videogame is lost when you have all the cards at your disposal from the start, but it's a decent, quick game.

Does not really work outside the computer game. Made more sense as a digital CCG. It's nice as a collectible, pretty mediocre as a real game. If anyone want's something simmilar, "Condottiere" is a better choice.

Acceptable but not good game in the style of magic/force of will/epic ....
Nice gimmick for a computer game, but not really good as a card game for itself.

RATING: 6
Good card game which is easy to learn. It's very basic though, and I think its much more fun if you own the other two decks. You build your own deck and many cards are really useless. The artwork is really lovely.  Sometimes feels like some rules are missing from the rule book. A must have if love the witcher games, but be aware! Almost all decks on ebay are fake, the only real decks come with the physical expansion copies of the witcher 3 games.

I've bought this game just because I'm a huge fan of the Witcher. It's OK but nothing more. Small startegy game which is not easy. I have all decks.

A custom set of the complete Gwent card game introduced in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. This set is an Oz Comic-Con production by local artists and not the officially licensed products included with the DLC retail releases.

Includes all 4 factions, rulebooks and reference cards. break tokens and player markers.

Some balancing rules needed regarding heroes but game flows nicely - love it in PC version as card game is ok. Monster deck wasn't my preference from beginning. Waiting for other decks and game might flourish a lot.

Lovely art and very cool mechanics even if they are copy-pasted (see Condottiere). Sadly the game is currently not very balanced, try the video game for a better experience.

Granie w Gwinta w wersji fizycznej troszeczkę mija się z celem, gdyż każda talia zawiera masę kart, których nigdy nie użyjesz (w wersji komputerowej była to gra, w której poszczególne karty znajdowało się w trakcie przygody więc miało to więcej sensu) ale klimatyczne i ładne ilustracji sprawiają, że nie mam ochoty pozbywać się swojego egzemplarza.

An OK little game that would be completely forgettable if not for the awesome theme and amazing artwork (Witcher 3 is one of the best videogames ever produced). It's biggest fault is that while it comes with a lot of cards for each faction, the optimal deck you can build is so obvious that you could easily throw away half of them. So you end up with 4 fixed decks, which ultimately hurts replayability.

Gwent, pulled straight out of Witcher 3 onto physical cards. It is not like the Gwent stand-alone game. Fun and thematic game, but probably not that interesting for someone who isn't a fan of the Witcher games.

Cool like card game for fans of the Witcher books and video game. Beautiful art from the game and very cool that it's the same game you can play within the video game. Mechanics are simple but fairly sound. The game isn't at that week balanced though as it was never meant to be a serious game. Still it's fun if you know the characters, though only have two of the four deals from the video game is a bit disappointing. 

I don't play it a ton but when I'm in the mood for a MTG style game I pull this one mostly for the theme and different mechanics

I own it more as a collectors item than a game, as the game play is not very fun once you know the perfect deck to construct.

Disclaimer: I know next-to-nothing about Wither (the fantasy world) and nothing about Witcher (the videogame).
This is purely a boardgame evaluation from someone who tried a lots of them.

BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD.
The factions are totally unbalanced, the winner decided by the opening draw (more or less) and the card iconography totally awful. There's no logical reason why fog should only affect defense, rain only backup and frost only offense (or whatever) and there's even smaller logical reason why NOT to state this on the weather card. And that's just the beginning of my complaints.

I think a new antonym to "INTUITIVE" should be defined: GWINTUITIVE.

played the Soc'tel/Monsters decks. Decent but unimpressive experience that accurately replicates Gwent in the game. It suffers for that reason too, since Gwent isn't exactly balanced.

As I am sure it is the case with most people, I have played this game digitally far more than I have used the physical cards I own. Never played the game it is based off of.

I own all 4 of the currently printed decks.

I love the Witcher series and Witcher III:  The Wild Hunt in particular.  And I love the gwent game within that game.  But honestly, the hard copy of gwent doesn't really add anything to the video game version.  Moreover, there are cards nobody would ever use and their inclusion is absolutely redundant once you figure that out.  It can still be good if you are playing with someone who knows which cards to pick, or simply remove them from the game.  But why include them in the first place?  In addition, I'm given to understand the game Condottieri has the same sort of setup without the extraneous baggage (I'll verify when I pick it up).  Unless you are a big Witcher fan like myself, you could skip it - you're not missing much.

I have played the digital version many times on the Witcher 3 and would really love a physical copy.  I was hoping this would come out sooner or later.  This game seems simple but can have quite a bit of depth.  The art work is great and the varied factions bring some added flavor.  When it seems like you have seen it all new cards are added to your deck and options multiply.  I dont seem to get tired of this game.  Highly recommended for a tactical skirmish type game without a ton of stats and rules to learn.  The mechanics bring a decent amount of options for outsmarting your opponent from quite a few different angles.

I do not wish to be harsh and I have tried to find the rules to this far and wide to make an opinion.
Personally I like the game a lot ... in Witcher 3. Not in the World of Witcher 3, just in that particular limited experience.
But judging this as a game, not a minigame in another computer game, this is the worst drudgery imaginable.
With no limit on how many cards of one kind you can put in the deck , it makes no sense for the majority of the cards to even exist ( Majority from already very limited pool)
There is a definite "correct/perfect" deck to build with every faction, and going against it is almost impossible, almost not because of strategy but because of luck.
And that's the other thing, since there is no strategy to building the deck, there is only the luck of the draw.
I would really love to love this game, and I have tried, but I can't not hate it.

I LOVE The Witcher franchise and CD Projekt Red... having said that, Gwent (which is fun to play inside the Witcher 3 video game) is a complete (and lackluster physical version, to be honest) Condottiere rip off; to make things worst "the designer" said on an interview that he came up with the idea for the game and developed it on a single weekend from scratch... yeah, right... this game is clearly a reimplementation of Condottiere, there's nothing wrong to admit it. FFG and the (real) creator of the game should be acknowledged for it.

Nice to have as a collectible, but its pretty hard to play. Too many things that are easy to do with a virtual game, but take too long irl (ie, drawing and playing specific cards, recalculating points each turn, etc). 
Card art is nice though, and for hardcore witcher fans, its definitely a must-have. For anyone else, pass. (though its not like its easy to get anyway...)

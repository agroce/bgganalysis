Based on 1 6 player game.
Only 1 player had played before and we had a few of the BGG aids.
This "60 minute game" took 3 hours to play.  At the end 3 of the players said they hated it.  Despite the look of the game it is a very aggressive game - its about survival and control after all, but the game is NASTY.

Very good area control game that's quite a bit of fun and plays with up to 6 players.  Lots of nice bits, and auction element adds lots more spice.  Uberplay did a nice job with the rules.

RATING: 8
Very underrated game that is very scalable, strategic, and thematic.  An area control-game, with lots of opportunity to "screw your neighbour".  Involves cards, which generally translates into luck of the draw, but in this game, this is never a factor as there are many opportunities for strategic play no matter what cards you draw.  This is one of my game group's and wife's favourites.

The rules were daunting for an area majority game, but it actually played smoother than it read.  It's kind of an [b]El Grande[/b] meets [b]Primordial Soup[/b], but not quite as good as either one.  Nevertheless, still a decent game.

RATING: 6
An interesting game.  I suppose it's mostly area control, though there's enough to the game to distract me from this seeming down side.  The six terrain types and varied access thereto, not to mention the ability to evolve (upgrade) that access, helps push the strategic aspect of the game.  Becomes more interesting as the board fills up.

I dislike the Power Grid-like incentive for being in last (and/or the Power Grid-like disincentive for being in the lead).  To me, always smacks of purposefully choosing suboptimal plays in order to set up later game pushes.  Feels less like strategy and more like gaming the system within the rules.

Except for, or because of, the above-noted PG-like aspect, pretty balanced.  I think the Intelligence ability may be a bit strong due to all the extra interactions it fosters.

I would play it again though it wouldn't be a first pick for me.

RATING: 8
Players represent species battling for control of land areas with different terain types.  Species evolve to allow them to contest more terrains, and gain special powers.  As with many Kramer games, you always want to do more in a turn than the rules allow. Multiple ways to score add interest. Nothing too original, but it all adds up to a very enjoyable game.  Downtime and the world changing between your turns become an issue with 5 or 6 players.  Quality of the components in my Clementoni edition is very good.

Was completely unable to grok this in one playing.  Would try again, but reserve the right to give up after that.  The way you build chains of tiles apparently wherever you please, which I still find weird, reminds me of Reef Encounter.  I wonder why I liked RE more?

(I think it's because RE is resource management, and I know where I am with that, whereas here there are lots of rules that just don't cohere into any comprehensible strategy.)

Although Wildlife has some big flaws, such as tacky game art and some usability issues concerning the creature charts, Wildlife does occationally deliver a fantastic experience.   However, the overall experience can sometimes be hit or miss depending on the downtime between turns.

Wildlife plays in less than 30 minutes for 2 players, yet can take 90+ minutes for 3 or more players due to the auctions.  Although I have enjoyed this game with any number of players, I have found that the 5 or 6 player games can sometimes be pretty slow moving with new players.  I have introduced Wildlife to several gamers and it has received mixed reviews.  More than one player has complained about the downtime between turns.     

WildLife features some counter-intuitive strategies, such as positioning yourself for last place with Double Intelligence in order to manipulate the game system.  This is clearly the dominant strategy, unless more than one player  competes for last place.  If this happens, then plenty of other strategies become more viable for other players, such as Double Food, or a quick scoring Mobility strategy, etc.  

A potential flaw is that Wildlife suffers from the same random distribution problems found in other card driven games.  However, your hand size of 10 cards offers more flexibility than most card driven games!  Perhaps the biggest flaw is that the creature charts are poorly designed.  I recommend abandoning them in favor of individual flow charts that show the adaptation level for each creature in a more readable format.     

I prefer to play with the following variants from the Rulebook: 1) players bid for starting creature, 2) new starting player each round based on the lowest success points [not recommended for a 5 or 6 player game!] 3) may use the expand action when a terrain card is auctioned, and 4) may acquire an unlimited number of ability cards.

We sometimes play with a house rule that is based on Kramer's Origo: 1)  A player may either use the Free Migrate action OR instead may discard exactly 2 cards in order to draw 2 cards at any time during his or her turn as a Free action. 

Update:  It's never a good thing when I have the desire to seriously tweak the core game mechanics.  After 8 plays, my conclusion is that the auctions significantly slow down the tempo of the game.  If and when I play this again, I will probably try it without auctions, without text cards and perhaps a limit on ability cards.  

Update 2:  Struggle of Empires does better what I liked about this game, so why play Wildlife?

Very abstract area influence game. Main problems for me with this game are that it feels soulless and that it's way too long for the gameplay it offers. Lesser problems are that it feels very luck dependent and that most decisions felt very, very obvious. Despite the fact that Kramer tried to incorporate a catch the leader mechanic, I also feel there is a distinct rich get richer feel to the game. The thing that baffles me most about this game is that the starting abilities the different species have, while thematically sound, really unbalance the game in a major way! For instance only three species have acces to water and desert while five species have acces to savannah and forest. While they allow the balance of the game to be corrupted on the one hand, in another aspect of the game they totally disregard the theme. What is the thematic background for a species to lose intelligence or agression (or any other ability) because they are in the lead? Anybody ever hear of survival of the [b]fittest[/b]?!

This game feels like a Frankenstein monster. Stitched together from different parts with disregard for any consistency or esthetic considirations. I call it Kramer's monster.

[Traded for Conquest of the Fallen Lands.]

Supposedly goes up to 6 players. I tried it once with 5 players, and that was too many. Even with the auctions on each turn, the downtime between turns was way too long. In fact, the auctions feel kind of forced to me and don't make sense theme-wise. Seems like maybe they were thrown in to reduce the amount of time people just sit around. I like the idea of this game a lot, though, and I enjoyed the non-auction gameplay, so I want to try it again but with fewer players.

I never got around to playing it again. It sat there for years, so I finally traded it, though I really did want to try it again. Oh, well.

RATING: 6
Interesting territory control game.  After 5 plays, I have developed some strategies... but the game is beginning to lose it's appeal -- perhaps because you can lose a lot of ground between turns (via attacks by opponents) when playing with the max (6p)... meanwhile, the variable-player-powers are unbalanced with fewer than 6p.

Limited number of plays, so rating might change. Nice wargame without a wargame theme. Downtime can be a bit of an issue if people want to over analyse - but bidding a card means you could be involved in anyone else's turn. Seems better with more players (6 optimum).

Only played once (and finished last) but it was a blast.  Lots of mechanisms at work and I'm very eager to try a different approach next game.  And eager to play that game soon.

An okay area control game with multiple ways of scoring.There is a noticeable turn order disadvantage that I felt wasn't conpensated by the different starting scores. I will need to try the variant where the losing player goes first. There is also some luck factors with the card draws.

I enjoy the mechanics, but the game can drag a bit, especially with 4+ players.

This is one of those games I really want to love, but several big problems are stopping me. As an area control game, this is wonderful. Ignore the theme, though, which is what pulled me in and ended up being the primary disappointment factor. I enjoyed the play up to the second scoring round, after which the game just drags on and on. The auction, which pushes it's way into every player turn, really grinds against the theme. I can see the auction as a necessary evil to the flow of the game system, but I really feel it ruins the feel of the game. Along these same lines, I didn't see the point of being able to steal advantages from other players, which are often hard earned and too easily lost. This is probably a perfect example of a great game ruined by a forced theme. Which is ironic, since it was the theme that caught my interest. This should have been developed as a more abstract game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's a rare game that scales up to 6, but Kramer seems to have done a pretty admirable job with his umpteen millionth venture into the world of area influence games, this time with a tile-laying twist. Each player represents a species, and each species has a unique combinations of terrains that it can function on; with all of the species in the game the map is balanced from the start, with less there can be issues. These didn't crop up for us because we played with the full compliment. So what of the game itself? Not bad, but nothing amazing either. On a standard turn one plays 3 cards from their hand of 10 (which is completely refilled at the end of each round), 1 of which has to be auctioned. Along the way you can gather adaptations (to lay tiles or even attack on other terrains) or special abilities, which range from decent to very dangerous. In general, one finds oneself competing primarily with a couple of adversaries based on the species starting restrictions, and the game runs from there. With 6 the auctioned terrain cards have an entertaining tendency to break down into 1 on 1 duels between players who both need the same one, I would think that with less than 6 this dynamic wouldn't be an automatic thing, which would lower the game's enjoyment value for me. The game feels overly dependent on the luck of the draw though, and with 6 the downtime was a bit high at times, as was the chaos factor. The overall game seems to be a solid collection of mechanics which nonetheless fail to coalesce into a compelling whole. Everything works well enough, but the game is lacking "wow factor".

first impressions are good. I want to play it more as there is many paths to victory and depth in this game.

Just embarassed by the card drawing which can diminished your possibilities. For example, i have been able to become an Attacker in one type (starting at zero : so i spend lot of evolution cards on it !)but i have never draw the good type card to play in it !!! So impossible to me to move, expand...just earn the 4 or 2 points for most evolution tokens !!!

RATING: 8.5
On the positive side. This game has many elements to it. With several ways to score. It presents some very interesting strategies and tactics. You have units on the board, food supplies, adaptations, abilities, bidding elements and various ways they interact with each other. While for me this is all a bonus it did lead to some analysis paralysis. I personaly like Tikal, Torres and that type of game but many in my group don't. The first game and only one so far lasted about 3 hours with rules being explained. However we missed one rule about the game ending when one player has placed his last man so that would have sped things up considerably. The rules aren't that complex. Some members of the group felt there was limited player interaction as in Tikal where you seem to optimize your position on your turn. Note, there is plenty of interaction when bidding on cards they want to sell. Normally I avoid even mentioning possible rule changes but the others in the group thought there were so many positive things about the game that they gave some thought as to what could be done to speed things up and make things better in general. One idea might be to not allow the abilities to be stolen, this would require they be auctioned off whenever a card with the arrow comes up rather than simply taken by the player lucky enough to get the card.  We all liked the basic premise, adaptations, scoring, abilities, food supply and the bidding system. Played this again and now I'm thinking the bidding should be done the way it is in Traumfabrik. These changes limit the randomness of the game and require the player to be more strategic in their thinking. They would both also speed up the game and limit the leader bashing. I also think I prefer leaving the abilities as is because it tends to balance the game.

I would also house rule 7 hand cards instead of 10, which is just too many.

I think this is a pretty good game that doesn't rely very much on luck. It is a game where you can almost always make a comeback, and is pretty fun. Can be a bit cutthroat at times. Not too difficult to learn, or teach. There is a few problems with theme that bother some people (such as how you can expand into an area by plopping one of your creatures in an area by itself that isn't anywhere close to the rest of your species). While thematically this could be annoying, it doesn't hurt the gameplay.

Thoughts:
Area control with conflict. If you like area control and can handle some conflict, this is really interesting game. The only problem with the game so far is that it seems a bit long with some AP taking place. But, that could be cured by playing it more often. There are a ton of ways to score in this game.

Diary:
Bought BGG marketplace March 2008

March 2009 - First play - 5 players.  We played with 5 players but we all agreed that it would probably be even better with 6. The tighter the better.  Was a bit long because we were all still learning how to play.  Look forward to playing this one again. Good time.

RATING: 4
Production: A lot could stand to be improved, but the art design is attractive, and the board and tiles are sturdy.  Play: Our three-player game lasted three hours; way too long.  There is so much to consider on one's turn, and the freedom to perform one's actions in any order doesn't help, as players must carefully calculate the ramifications of each move taken in each order.  There are interesting elements, but I think I might prefer a simpler, less strategic version without abilities, without adaptations, without any of the fiddliness, but just as a simple area-control game, influenced by unalterable adaptations.  (2+0+2) (1 play)

Humdrum, run of the mill area control.
Lots of different factors to consider, but the only strategy you need is get some points from lots of sources, rather than focusing on one and don't get involved in mutually destructive turf wars. This is one game where the disparity between theme and mechanics bugs me.
I found myself thinking very little, and won the game to boot.

Preliminary rating since I've only played it once. Money-VP conversion seems a bit too easy (or ambiguous in the rules) and the cards seem inordinately variable in thier power.

The first time I played it we got several vital rules wrong which broke the game.

A replay shows it's a very interesting and fun game. Some planning involved but not too much. More playings would probably up the rating as we did a lot of rookie mistakes.

RATING: 7
After one play, I'm putting this at 7.  It seemed very well balanced...especially in the 6 player game.  The technologies, which give you advantages, become difficult to hold onto when in the lead.  This makes for a nice mechanic to prevent a run-away leader.  Perhaps this game is a bit too long though for what it offers.  Repeat playings may go faster and justify this rating...I'm hoping.

RATING: 5
A rather meaty game that is quite reminiscent of El Grande and other "majority" games.  Players play a tribe of creatures and gradually play them onto the board.  The board is broken by terrain up into twelve areas.  As areas fill up, bonus points are awarded, with a major scoring happening three times during the game.  During major scoring, just about every facet of the game is scored (deliberately?) blurring who is actually ahead.  Gameplay is driven by the play of "action cards" augmented by special abilities that you can pick up (and lose) along the way.  I do like the game, but it did seem rather long with four players - this could only get worse with more... the mandatory auction feels like it was added to the game to keep everyone awake while waiting for their next turn.  Interesting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's long (3 hours) and maybe a little too tactical (you're stuck with the cards you get or are auctioned), but there's plenty of interesting things going on and tough decisions to make.  The main trick seems to be in the right position to cause a major scoring round.  Definitely use the "each player starts with at least one arrow card" variant, and perhaps there should be a way to buy arrow cards later, because it hurts a lot if you never draw one.

I like this game marginally better than some of the other Kramer games I've played, probably just because the theme seems a better fit.  In fact, most of the thematic elements can be related to the "real life" actions of animals and/or evolution, with a couple exceptions (the 'Mobility' ability basically lets you teleport and exchange places with another animal... huh?!)  

One thing I learned during my first play of Wildlife... a beer and pretzels game THIS IS NOT.  There is a real brain burner lurking under the furry, friendly theme.  The gameplay can become really cutthroat!

My rating will likely change as I revist this interesting game.

This is an interesting game.  The victory point system rewards just about anything you do, but clearly some goals are more valuable than others.  It's got a great theme and a nice blend of mechanics, but it doesn't quite achieve that spark of greatness.  I've only played with a full table of 6 players, and the games tended to run a little on the long side, but all players seemed to be genuinely engaged during the entire game.

An area majority game that I keep in my collection for its ability to handle 6P fairly well. This one puts an interactive spin on area majority with the way you can knock each other out of spots and steal upgrade cards from each other, plus you have an auction each turn. The auction on each turn offers other players a bonus action and reduces downtime by keeping you engaged during other players' turns. There are bonus cards that you can take and have taken again from you such that they frequently bounce around the table. Thanks to the bonus cards and attacks, I never feel safe when I'm in front. 

The downside is that while downtime is generally low due to the auction on each player's turn, the game still takes a long time with 6P, and players lagging behind lose interest.

Wildlife is an innovative and slightly complex area control game that involves a fair amount of conflict between the players who must jockey and manipulate each other for position.  It, like many good euro games, offers many options for scoring, so there are several paths to victory.  I have only played with 5 or 6 players.  It is one of only a few euros that really shines with that number of players, but what holds the rating down for me is that there can be a fair amount of downtime with that many players.

Wildlife is a great offering from a solid game designer.

(2-6 players) The hyper balancing mechanisms turn this into a game of inches and left me with a bad taste about it.  I work to gain the lead then sit and watch all my work go down the toilet as the 'disadvantaged' steal my upgrade cards.  Feh!

Very interesting game, but the german text made this slightly too tricky to keep track of. Quite a variety of elements offers different ways to victory. My first game was a learning experience, and it took a while to get halfway through. With the english edition it would be easier, but still a bit of a test for me, plenty to think about. Lots of attacking the leaders though, but I kept up with them. Way better than Alea's Icezeit though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Played 1 time. I expected to like this a lot but didn't. I find the special action tile thingys totally skewer the game and extend the duration. My first playing took nearly 3 hours! The game itself, playing animals to get sets and majorities is quite fun, but all the extra chrome drowns the game and makes it go back and forth ad nauseum and makes it very hard to strategize. Without the extra ability cards, I think this game might be a 6 or even a 7.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
First game played with 3 and it was very difficult to attack since 2 out of the 3 players always had the defense card.  From the way the game played, I anticipate it will be much better with 6 players.  

Interesting mechanic that you have to auction a card every time.  I think the auction will also work much better with more people.

My favorite mechanism is the one that gives a bonus for finishing a region: it moves the game forward and makes for interesting short-term goals. In fact, this game could be better were it not for the luck of the draw and the weird and unbalanced "ability stealing" mechanism. In fact, the newer Origo takes the best of Wildlife and adds a number of other clever tricks: it is the better of the two.

Have only played it as 2 player so far. The mixture of mechanics in this game is great. I enjoy the amount of player conflict verses area control. the scoring mechanics are interesting. Figuring out how to maximize your score is a lot of fun but can cause a bit of AP sometimes. There are a lot of choices in this game and the different ones can drastically change your outcome. I look forward to playing this with more than 2 and will update this rating after that.

The theme of this game is at odds with the gameplay. Much like Bridges of Shangri-La, you have a area control wargame with a strangely peaceful set of components destroying each other. In this game it is rabbits, bears, snakes, eagles and so forth. In Bridges it is Bhudist monks.

Either way, it is still a decent game. I just wish the bears were missile silos or Russian special forces or something more suiting to destroying other pieces around the board.

Really intriguing game about the spread of species in a made up land.  You start out small and have to expand and adapt to stay competitve.  There is an interesting mechanic where each turn you have 3 actions, 1 of which you have to auction off to the other players.  For a euro, this one has a lot of direct conflict and can turn into a real slugfest.  Not for everyone, but certainly entertaining with the right group of gamers.

Ages ago, I loved this game. Nowadays you can notice that this is an older design, but it's still a good game.

While there's the luck of the draw problem, it seems not to be game breaking, even if your first 2 rounds are completely messed up (= can't use any cards for yourself).

Only frustrating thing is, that the whole board can change before it's your turn again and this means that the game will slow down hard, as you have to wait until it's your turn, before you start to think and plan your next moves.

Also, the game ends at the end of a players turn, instead of the end of the actual round, which can easily decide the game.

Away from that, it's a still a nice and somewhat unusual majority game with a lot of direct interaction. Stealing, blocking, killing, no solitaire euro like most euros nowadays.

I had gone off this a bit because it seemed too chaotic and long.  I got this specifically to play with 6 since I didn't have a lot of games that took that number of players and so I usually played it at six and actually hadn't played it at all for a few years.  I decided to dig it out and play with three recently and it was a far more enjoyable game.

The designer is Wolfgang Kramer and this reminds me quite a bit of another great game of his, El Grande.  It is area control but with significant complexities around where you can go and how. It is certainly different enough to El Grande that you wouldn't mind owning both but if you like El Grande there is a good chance you will like this.

You get to design your race/creature/dudes to allow you to be better able to either take territiry off other players or to try to avoid conflict and expand in to unoccupied areas.  You can buy special bonus abilities, but in a stroke of genius these are limited and if you are in the lead someone who want to buy one of these will take yours so you can't just buy the best powers and sit back until you win.

There are two things I dislike in general.  Each scoring phase results in you getting a lot of points for things, things you may not even have worked for.  This is a classic point salad game so if you hate that then you will probably not like this.  You should get most of your points from things you worked at so the extra points that fall in your lap (which the other players get too) shouldn't really be overwhelming.  The other thing I dislike is the tactic of overspending so you can go back down the score track (whcih is an advantage).  With six players I think the game is probably too chaotic and definitely is too long with too much downtime.

RATING: 7
Plenty of strategies and tactics. But stealing/having the ability cards seems to be fairly key. Especially in a 3 player game. So the luck of the cards was a surprisingly large factor. Also it hurt to be strong at the start as opponents must take the leaders abilities first if there is a choice. 

Food seemed strangely irrelevent. Or rather the amount you had was irrelevent as you usually just bet it all if the card was useful and just 3 if it would be uncontested. So there is no point having 10 if your fellow bidder has 11. You knew it would come back to you soon and there was little advantage to having it in store (it does score a little). But maybe this was due to a 3 player game where many terrain cards were useless to one of the two bidders and your auction coming arounds so soon.

I played this once before May 3rd, 2009. This game takes about 15min to be taught, 15 min to setup and maybe an 90min to play for 6 players. There appears to be a lot of options and has a good theme. each player is given a creature that has certain abilities (attack, expand, migrate, or nothing) in the 5 regions on the board. Each person is given a certain number of creatures, food tokens and 10 cards. The cards range from special action cards (get two food, take 1 additional action, move anywhere, defense, and attack; if cards are gone you steal from other players, however have to take leader unless tie, then choose), placement on the board, increase ability, wild card and special text cards. Starting with the start player gets 1VP and then each sucessive player gets one more VP. Starting player places first and then each player initially places a total of 3 creatures on the board. On your turn you play 3 action cards and then get to do a migrate movement on the board. On your turn you may also swap 3 food for one VP (and vice versa on bids up to 2 VPs) and auction. You must action at least one card. With an auction, each player to the left bids (min 3). Once you pass you are out, however you may rebid higher until all others pass. At the end of your turn you refill your hand up to 10 cards. Scoring rules.

Area influence:auctions: variable player powers:tile placement:screwage

An excellent underrated, overlooked, unique, extremely well themed and strategic Kramer game(similiar to Die Handler in all of those ways but only those ways). This would scale well but like any games with lots to think about downtime and chaos will be much higher at the higher numbers so I think 3 or 4 best keeping those things in check while also making planning easier and more rewarding. With 3 or 4 it also seems a little long so with more it would be much longer I'm sure and I don't think I will bother trying it.

Lots to think about is right as there is a lot of stuff going on and there are a lot of things to account for like: where to get majorities, which special powers to go for, where should you evolve, where and who to attack, how much food to keep for auctions, which card to auction off and most importantly where to work on getting points from all the multiple ways to score.  

I think balance issues are un-warranted as something you are weak in can be easily upgraded (although you should pick species carefully if less than 6 players). There is some luck of the draw and actions are dictated by the cards a little more than I would like but there are wild cards and enough things to do in the game to help mitigate it. There is a nice catch-up mechanism built-in although sometimes you don't agree with the choice it gives you. 

Great game which has been marred by low ratings due to people playing and judging the 5 or 6 player game and the fact that it is also a "gamer's game" like Die Handler.

Well, I certainly don't get the strategy of this game yet.  I most recently played this with a group of high-school students.  Brilliant students to be sure, but only I had ever played the game.

This isn't too bad for an area-control game (I tend to shy away from area-control games).  The catch up mechanic works well, while the overall game is pretty thematic.  The points for largest herd seem a little out of scale compared to the other points available, but I thought , overall, that the game worked.

Actually, I much prefer the random feature of this game (card draw and auction) to the one in El Grande (4 draws from separate card stacks).

Head and shoulders better than Wongar.

This game has a lot going on and some may call it a fiddly but I think the game actually holds together pretty well. On a players turn he can play three cards, one of which MUST be auctioned. So on each players turn all players are involved in at least one auction. The game does play on the long side but for me it is one of those games that I don't feel the time pass by. I'm too busy looking over what's going on and thinking about how I'm going to deal with the situation. A fine game that I'd like to play more.

I like some of the ideas, but this game takes way too long, and overly-complex for what it is. I've played twice and both times the game clocked in at over 2.5 hours. I don't need to ever play this game again. This is a Kramer design? Talk about a bad day. I prefer Evo, for an evolution-themed area-control game.

The game offers too many decisions for players, and it seriously bogs down a game that doesn't really have that much going on. I think it'd be better without the auction phase in each turn. This would also allow you to get rid of the entire food mechanic, which is kind of stupid anyway. (You can sell victory points for food in order to better defend yourself against having abilities stolen from you, and then buy the victory points back for the same exchange rate later in the game.) I also don't like how a species abilities can be stolen away to other species; thematically it just doesn't make sense that you lose a learned ability. The palcement rules are full of "take that" opportunities, which I can't stand in a multi-player game.

WildLife is an enjoyable game, but not one I foresee myself playing too often.  The action cards seem powerful and too apt to be switched back and forth between players, especially the "Aggression" and "Defense" cards.  It could be because we were all newbies, maybe I would need to play with an experienced player.  I like how you have to develop your abilities in the different terrain types.  There are a lot of things going on and the game is actually a little daunting when going through the rules.  However, there are so many area majority games, and so many Kramer area majority games - this one seems to add multiple elements that don't provide enough satisfaction.  I would rather play El Grande if I had 5 players.  I would still like to try WildLife with 2 or 3, as many seem to think it plays better with fewer players.

Wildlife is a game by Kramer and it stongly resembles a "civ" type of game with area majority scoring.  It involves taking a actions by playing cards from your hand.  This is a pretty neat game.  There are many ways to score points and the game is sort of medium to heavy, but its a lot of fun.

No one in the group liked the ability cards. They are too powerful and make the game too chaotic. They also get constantly passed back and forth. So on your turn, the first thing you do is to take back the card that the other player took back last turn from you, etc, etc. At least that was the case for everyone else; I only received one "get an ability" card the entire game ! That left me as the only one without "superpowers". This left me feeling the game was broken.

Based on one play; six players; I finished barely fifth (by one point).  The instruction given wasn't great and missed some points (primarily playing region cards immediately after winning an auction).  This game dragged on with paralysis and I just wanted it to end.  Perhaps the reason why I didn't like it was because it was my first play.  I'd be willing to give this another try but until then I'm not impressed with this.  And the types of creatures are really irrelevant.

Pretty good. I like the scoring (area influence plus 'biggest group' plus others.

Area control with a lot of interesting decisions to make. I especially like how you have to auction off a card every turn as one of your actions, and if you win an auction on someone else%u2019s turn you may immediately take the action that you bid on. This allows players to take actions and participate actively in the game when it is not their turn. If it was a bit faster it go up to an 8 in my book.

Good game, but best with even number of players where possible to ensure play balance. Combines a lot of different ideas - area influence, auction, asymmetrical abilities, etc. into a fairly cohesive package. Some randomness in card draw is offset by large hand size. Very good game deserving of better attention, in my opinion.

Love the attempt at this game.  Concept is wonderful and the theme is great.  I love that it keeps all the players involved with the bidding processes on everyone's turn.  They however missed the boat on balancing the deck you can get totally deck hosed in this game if you have a bad draw of the cards for your species.

One last nit pick is why did they have to choose TWO green colors in the game?

RATING: 3
The theme and some mechanics are interesting. The fact that you can upgrade your creatures is interesting. Nevertheless, this game first suffer from information overflow and second, 2 of the actions you can do can be played anywhere on the board. So there is not really a felling of territorial control and expansion. I ended up breaking the largest herd by paradroping a creature in the middle of the herd, It makes no sense.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Excellent game but it takes a bit of a time committment, especially the first time around.  Several different actions from improving intelligence to expanding your herd and other moves in an effort to make your species the best.  Plays best with 4 or more would be my guess.  My first play was with 3 and while there was some conflict, much more would have to occur encouraging other strategies to be employed with 4-6 players.

RATING: 5
Ohhh, so close. Some things to like about this game. However, it seems to want the 6 player max, and with an auction by each player every turn it can be a half hour until it's your turn again. For me, this is the definition of "too long for what it is". Not horrible though, in its Euro-ishness, I could be talked into playing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This is an excellent area control game with some interesting elements that make it difficult to determine the best course of action in a given situation.  Each turn offers opportunities to develop one's species, obtain adaption cards that give special bonuses, spread one's influence around the board or hurt one's opponents.  Successful players will try to find the moves that accomplish more than one goal at once.  The forced auction each turn is a nice mechanic and it serves to spread the food supply around the table while offering people the opportunity to improve their position on others' turns.  Timing the scoring rounds is crucial and controlling the major scoring rounds is often of primary importance.  The game does suffer a bit from downtime with six.

ok, it takes a long time and there are periods of downtime (which can be used for planning your turn) but it gets regular 6 player outings in our group so there must be something to it.

01/11/14 Played a four-player game in two hours. 
The theme is weak. Each player's critter starts in an appropriate environment, but can eventually go anywhere if the right adaptation tiles are bought. To quote a dude on BGG, "I also don't like how a species abilities can be stolen away to other species; thematically it just doesn't make sense that you lose a learned ability." A *great* many people on BGG posted that with less than a full compliment the game is not balanced. With less than six some creature's natural enemy (that wants its same environment) will be missing giving that player an advantage. To quote another BGG alum, "I enjoy the mechanics, but the game can drag a bit, especially with 4+ players. Has a strange 'deliberately do poorly at the beginning' aspect to it where you really do not want to be in the lead at the start or you suffer having your abilities stolen every turn. Definitely a unique game, but one that just doesn't grab me."  It was impossible to read/distinguish the abilities cards of others upside down across the table. In brief, why so much brown? http://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/110001/wildlife  I grew quite weary of the Leader Bashing. The game took much longer than I'd assumed at start. I was growing tired of it at the one hour mark, only to figure we were only about 40% through. In summary its long , dry, and there is little fun  For this (alleged) theme I'd rather play Evo, Urland, or Primordial Soup. Or for a better Wolfgang Kramer area/majority control game I'd rather play El Grande.

I've now played this twice with 6 players and the game was definitely interesting.  I especially like the inherent rivalries caused by species best adapted to similar terrain.  Unfortunately, I found the downtime between turns to be excruciating.  Interestingly, you can score points in so many different ways that I really couldn't figure out where I went wrong in the game.  Of the 6 people I played with, 3 really liked the game.  I personally couldn't get past the downtime problem and didn't like it as much.  Perhaps the downtime would be less of a problem with 4 or 5 people...

At first play game has very many different mechanics laced into it: area of control (land zones, like El Grande), group power selection (evolution cards, like Primordial Soup), land type power selection (land zone abilities, like Reef Encounter), auctioning (land type card placements), and more.  I'm unsure of whether all these different mechanics rolled into one are a good thing.  Also seemed to be not much player interaction -- maybe auction is the only time players have to work off one another.  Yes, players can interfere with one another's placement, but that still has a disjointed feel to it.

There's something that's not right about this game, or else I just don't get it. Being in last gives a pretty strong advantage. You can't have your abilities stolen, which means you can amass a large collection of them. These seem to be the most advantageous asset in the game. Maybe that would be ok, except being in last doesn't mean you're losing in this game. You could have incredible potential in terms of number of animals on the board and number of adaptations. These aren't banked into your score until major scoring rounds only three times in the game. So everyone can see you've leveraged your abilities to take a commanding lead, but they can't "attack the leader" against you. They have to attack the leader against someone else.

This Wolfgang Kramer game has a surprisingly high amount of "take that".  On the surface Wildlife appears to be just another area influence game but each player can use aggression to directly attack another player.  Also you can steal intelligence (or other attributes) from other players. Having a lead in this game just gives you a big red X on your chest. Not a brain-burning, strategic game by any means but a nice way to release one's aggression.

This game continues to amaze me, in part because I never come close to winning it.  It combines a traditional auction with an aggressive (your animals die!) area control platform.  Downtime is minimal for a 6 player game because you can win the auction to take an action during each player's turn.  Finally, there are lots of ways to score victory points which adds a nice layer of complexity.

RATING: 5
Players take on the role of a species (bird, snake, mammoth, bear, crocodile, human), try to expand their presence on the mapboard and gather evolutionary special abilities. Players are dealt 10 cards. The cards allow the player to do actions on the terrain indicated, evolve, get abilities, etc. It has some neat concepts, but it is a long game (3 hrs), lots of downtime when you wait for your turn and there was one rule where you could convert VPs to food for bidding (which everyone did to avoid being the leader and losing their abilities). Also you could be unfairly targeted just for being in the wrong region. It's fun if you are winning, with lots of pieces on the board, but not so fun if you are behind. Card hands may limit what you can do as well. Now my opinion is only based on 5 and 6 players games. Perhaps the length of the game reduces with less players.

First impression: It seems there might be balancing issues with other than full six players. Even with 5 someone is going to benefit some from the fact that his "competitor specie" is not playing. Mechanics are fine even if a bit on chaotic side.

I like the game.  Its more of a gamer's game than Evo.  Its a land area control game and can get abilities to change what lands you can move into and additional abilities to help out in other ways (more cards, extra points, etc.).  That being said it takes about 1  hour or so to play so only gets played once in a gaming session.

A lot of rules, errata, and lack of clear examples in the instructions.  Pretty fun though.  Played once at a local gaming group.  It was new to everyone so it took 2 1/2 hours to get through the 2nd major scoring.  We ended as it was past 11:00, but someone would have run out of pieces before we got to the major scoring I think.  Lots of interesting stuff and pretty fun, but went a little slow.  I think if we played it again, we could halve the time though.  Just don't know if I will get back to this if other games are around though.

RATING: 7.5
Dusted it off while looking for a six-player game that wasn't too complicated. The table voted to try it out and everyone seemed to quite like it. When I tried it way back when it was first released, it felt like a dud. Now, after many heavy euro-games have come and gone, this game seems almost quaint. Lively mechanisms with many ways to play encourages many strategies. Auction games are popular with my gaming group, so we all looked forward to bidding for the instant actions on other people's turns. Other players on this site appear to think this to be a drag, so read the other comments to decide if the game is for you.

Well themed area control game.  I am not perfectly sure from just one play, but the balance seems to be good.  The game plays quickly and easily.  I would love to try this one again, as it played very well with 6.  I hear it is not easy to get a copy of, which is unfortunate.

RATING: 6
It's much better with 4 than with more, even if the starting positions can be a little skewed. I like  the different ways you can approach the game, and working out what to bid (ie VP sacrifice now for a potential later score) is never easy. It some ways it feels like you can never bid too much to ensure you're in last position and can steal and keep the special powers as these can be key to building a solid scoring platform, as well as minimising the chances of you being "mistaken" for the leader and getting bashed. Because in the end, it's just another majorities leader-bashing take-that type of game, and it needs equally experienced players to know when someone coming last on the VP track is actually coming first. Which is not easy, so the game can be a big table talking whine fest as well. Still, it provides some interesting play you don't see elsewhere, with the overbidding to secure last position, and trying to work out how far last is really last. Note, never ever use the variant that re-sets the turn order each round to start with the last player. Players can go a horrible length of time before they get another play, and it elongates the late-game (which is already long enough) while people assess and re-assess bids in light of the impact on turn order and ending-the-game potential rather than just the VP positioning.

The only significant theming I recall is that each player's species starts with an appropriate mix of environments to move/build in.  That's nice, but other than that, it's a short checklist of familiar German game mechanics: play for position in multiple zones; bid for extra actions during other players' turns; get points for largest/longest mass of contiguous units; score in special scoring rounds that come up on a track; and score for way too many different things overall.  It doesn't add up to a coherent picture or to a game you can strategize well over the course of all the other players' turns.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I generally don't like Euros, especially if they involve bidding mechanics. This game is the grand exception. Highly underrated and out of print, this game is a deep area control experience. I think it can be regarded as a medium complexity game, with many scoring possibilities. Players play 3 cards, of which one is put out for auction. The winner of the bidding may play it on the turn of the active player. So currency is never enough. This makes things quite strategic. Do I auction off a good card to make more money, or a bad one that nobody wants not to give players useful extra actions? The last game I played was quite a close call. Players don't have unique abilities, but adapt to different regions on the board and have to evolve in order to have more expansion options. Player interaction is good, with some conflict, but not excessively. I actually think that being too aggressive might turn into a disadvantage in the long run. Would like to play it more often.

RATING: 4
Friday night fatigue, German text and rule complexities made it difficult for me to get a handle on concepts such as wandering and attacking. Cards drawn dictate your decisions, so luck for such a deep calculating game feels alittle unkind. Turns can be quite longwinded; I may feel like playing again with only 3, though auctions won't be hotly contested. However, it's a 'majorities score' game like El Grande with alot of scoring triggered; this is a genre which doesn't provoke much excitement in me. There was some interesting mechanics to consider, but the highlight for me was the "hungersnot" card. Told you I was tired.

Update: well a 2nd playing of Wildlife could well be a turning point in my tolerance of certain gaming styles, as did War of the Ring has put me off large rulebooks and playing time of more than 150 mins. Now I really can't tolerate the majorities method of scoring, at times it's a headache to monitor, but ultimately laborious to administer; games are meant to be entertaining at least.(So far only O Zoo le Mio has made majorities palatable). Unfortunately, the graphic design doesn't assist the process as some areas bleed into one another when covered with a chit. The 2nd play was with 5 which is fine with the streamlined El Grande, but for its fiddly offspring with overblown turn options, it is torturous. Ooh, and the auctioning of terrain, ability upgrades etc really throws the theme off for me.

This game simply did not live up to my expectations. I think Wolfgang Kramer is at his best in collaboration with other designers, and this solo effort could have used some Kiesling or Ulrich influence.
  The game itself has a lot of good ideas, and I like how the game evolves as well as the individual species. The random aspect of the game is a bit high, and a player unable to draw anything but landscape cards is going to get left in the dust.

Several people in my large game group picked this up from Tanga, so it was inevitable that I would play this. I liked it. Unfortunately for one of the players, I ended up going after him, as where he was gave me the best oppertunities. I played the Croc, so I ended up going first, and played a first round plague, starting down and dirty. I came in second, about 20-24 behind the first player, and about that ahead of the next. 

Very fun and I'd readily play this again. I'd also buy it if it came up on Tanga again, but then there are already several copies I have access to.

Very interesting game with tons of options, decent amount of player interaction, and quite a few reasonable pathways to success.

Definitely a fun game, and I expect my rating will go up when I play it more.

I want to like this game.  However, it feels completely unbalanced and almost completely driven by luck.  It also has the potential to suffer from coalitions.  I think I see a good game here, but it feels like a mirage.  The Ability cards need to be seriously nerfed or reinterpreted.  This game has an interesting theme and set of mechanics.  Unfortunately, all of that is underneath a different broken set of mechanics.

Rated after three plays. A bit dependent on card luck, but otherwise a typical Kramer design (which is a good thing).

There is nothing really wrong with this game, it's enjoyable at 2 hours and the bits are nice (despite the suspicious green cardboard the counters are made from), but it's not one I normally choose to play. Why? Almost everything in it is done better elsewhere. Tile placement battles? Reef Encounter. Area Control? El Grande. Upgrading your abilities? AoEIII. Still happy to haul it out on occasion, though.

RATING: 8.5
Area control via tile placement, movement, expansion, and conflict. Each player's species begins with different abilities on each terrain type, but via adaptation can develop these abiliies. A predecessor to Dominant Species, with some of the same feel in a much simpler package. The abilities cards add another layer of depth to a great game.

 I raised my rating to 8 because this game has a lot of strategic elements and you have to think about the way you place your tiles and move them to gain the best scoring. We used some of the variant rules but I don't suggest the one that allows a player to posses as many of each type of ability card as they wish. If a player picks up the right wildlife cards he can get ahead way to quickly so stick with the 2 card of each limit. Excellent game.

Lots of difficult choices to make. Like Princes of Florence there's scope for trying radically different strategies each playing. With five players, if you're still playing after 90 minutes there's too much thinking going on. That said, to win you'll need to think about what you're doing, just don't dawdle too much - there's a balance. Plan ahead where possible - you need to keep up a good pace to really enjoy it. Best with four to reduce a chunk of the downtime, enable players to have more control and have it come back to your turn soonish.

Players tend to bid too high at first until someone wins by just selling their cards instead of playing the game.

A hodgepodge of rules - including some nice ones (out of turn play, upgrade stealing from the highest point player). However, the result is a bit of a mess. A haphazard scoring system (every flippin' thing scores somehow, but in a slapdash, inconsistent fashion). Long too, especially with a lot of players. Also problematic with an odd number of players - the player without their natural enemy in play will have a distinct advantage. Don't get me started on the thin theming - snakes bidding off their upgrades, exchange teleports, and gene stealing. That's how they did it in the wild so many years ago, I suppose. Actually, it's very similar to Evo, but that game is more skillfully put together, quicker and much more fun. A lesser Kramer, in my opinion.

I really like this game.  As a player, you are constantly pitted against how you want to build yourself up.  Clearly you want to advance yourself with the technology and the ability to run into new spaces, but yet at the same time you really need to get yourself on the board.  I felt in constant struggle, trying to find the balance to keep myself up with the rest of the pack.  What a blissful struggle it was.  

I really feel that this game rewards solid playing.  There are many satisfying moments when you pull off a scoring coup, knowing full well that your cleverness brought to to the forefront.  There is also a nice catch the leader mechanism that doesn't feel pasted on or forced.

My only gripe is that it is perhaps too long for what it offers.  If you play with four quick players though this should be a most satisfying experience.

Played with six and at first, with the intriguing theme and mechanics of building up your animal, I was intrigued.

There's just a bit too much going on here and not in a good way-it's just not as tight and streamlined as other games with similar mechanics, such as El Grande.

RATING: 8
This is an interesting area-control game.  I like the theme more than El Grande, with which Wildlife shares some mechanisms.  It starts a little slowly as the board fills up, and then bang bang bang, the scoring rounds come fast and furious.  Staying one step ahead is the key.

There's plenty of confrontation here, so play with thick-skinned friends! This is among a growing number of games that I enjoyed back when, but hasn't aged well. In my most recent playing (2011), the game went over like a lead balloon with the other players. I found myself especially frustrated going fourth in a four-player game and having all the scoring rounds occur right before I got a turn. Rating downgraded and placed on trade pile.

Strategic area control. The more players the better it is. The rate might go up once I have played it with six players.

Edit: With six this is a very nice game. There is plenty of room for screwage!

This slightly older title contains more luck and more take-that than we are accustomed to seeing from this designer, but both elements work to Wildlife's favor. If the back-and-forth squabbles get frustrating, just try another approach.

Some nice mechanics here, but there are a few glitches that keep me from returning to it frequently.  First, the intelligence cards seem too powerful.  Sure, there can be a good deal of back and forth with them for much of the early game, but once someone has a bad draw/exceptionally good draw, they can stay in one player's hand for much of the game.  Which means they get twice as many turns and have twice the chance to keep the cards.  Secondly, many of my games have been three-player affairs.  Conquest/war games with three players can put one player near elimination pretty quickly.  I think I would rather play with four or five.

Such an excellent thinker. I love the evolution theme, and there's an excellent blend of combat, strategy and control. If I've learned anything playing this it's to watch what everyone is doing very carefully. If you don't someone will walk away with the game. I need to play this more.

A simple game of area control. The characters are all balanced, but for some reason the eagle always seemed to win in my gaming group.... why I don't know.... The ability to upgrade your actions in certain areas is a nice touch and can be the key to victory. Forming alliances and beating up on a chosen opponent is unfortunately a quick way to a win. Wildlife was played a few times in my gaming group and placed back in the cupboard after better options were purchased. Good, but not great.

I wanted to get a hold of this one long before it went OOP but really was trying to "try before buy" method on it as it just didn't fully grab me enough to put up the money for it. Now it's harder to get a copy (as it's not EVERYWHERE) and well I had to finally just pull the trigger on it. I got mine in a trade that I was very happy with.

Now the game. It's a little dry and bit of a brain burner but not too much of either for it to be a bad thing. All in all it's a pretty sweet game. Quite a bit going on and lots of dickery. One play with 2 players (which will be the main way it's played) but I hope to play with more soon.

This has gotten a decent amount of play in my group.  The randomness of the draw is somewhat mitigated by the 10 card hand.  Fun, aggressive game.

RATING: 7
Great components and theme. It has simple rules but it results in a complex game. It is a great game but it has the element that the players need to co-operate to "balance" the game (on the other hand, it comes "naturally" in this game).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Lots of interesting choices and looks good too!  Have to watch out for runaway leader, so the group you play with can influence the game.  Of course it can be very difficult to see who the runaway leader is since they could be in last place!
In 6 player game, there can be a downtime issue even though the auctions keep it bearable.

My oldest son also likes it after his 1st play.

Clementoni edition.A great synthesis of card play, tile placement, and area control mechanics. Wildlife offers players an array of interesting play options. Plays well with three to five  players. Components ranged from very good (the cards) to below average (the tiles). The first game was alittle long. And while the length has not decreased significantly in five subsequent times I have played it since, my enjoyment has grown. Numerous options within a graspable framework! That said, it's appeal will be such only to experienced boardgamers who give it the time. And after I hit the dime, I was sold.Another great Wolfgang Kramer game!

(One 3 player game) I'd like to try this again, but it's quite confrontational. The's a lot of tension each turn - be prepared to have intelligence cards stolen.

RATING: 5
I've only played this once, but I consider it very unlikely that I will give it another try.  It doesn't help that I was out of the game fairly early, but with multiple hours still to play.  To add insult to injury, at the end I was placed in a kingmaker position.  My single bad game experience aside, this game has a whole laundry list of things I don't like.  I don't like closed economies, so having to pay for auctions to the other players rather than the bank bothered me.  I don't like exaggerated catch-up mechanisms, so the  stealing of traits from only the lead players bothered me.  I don't like restricted movement, so the evolution system bothered me.   Not to mention that area majority is a mechanic that's been done to death.  If you're looking to play an evolution game with me, I'll try to convince you to play [gameid=1159] instead, which is tighter, faster, and has better art and fun factor.

Area-control game with an evolutionary theme.  I'm absolutely terrible at area control games, and knowing that I'll never win does lower the enjoyment value a bit.  But I like this one better than most of the others I've tried.

Looks good. Although I enjoyed the game I found it a bit cumbersome. House rule for next game would be 'no free migration' - this action option added time to play but was not carried out by anyone. I may upgrade if I play again.

I really thought I'd like this one more.  However, it just drags on (and on, and on) as people try to figure out best moves out of tons of options.  As my friend put it, it's like slogging through mud.

A lot of downtime, and don't believe the box.  60 minutes is a joke.  It took us 2.5 hours for a 5 player game.

Played twice (with 6 players). In my experience, it has been too long for what it is, but playing it with 6 certainly did not help. However, I am not sure the balance regarding terrain types would be good with less than 6 (except maybe with 3 carefully selected types).

Not since Die Macher have I seen such a complex blend of chaos and analytics. It's like Tikal meets Modern Art meets Princes of Florence. Many games have tough tactical choices (with only one dominant optimal strategy), but this is one of the richest games for tough strategic choices. I haven't even come close to trying all the different strategies this game provides. (I do know how to be in 1st place and not have it be a disadvantage -- beware the intelligence trap!). Unlike most games having the most VPs does not mean you're closest to winning because the early and middle game is a battle of potential to score, not actual score (actual score reduced potential to score). This building of potential to score but not actual score is a subtle "cold war" arms race that is quite unique.

 Like Tikal some folks have problems with length and downtime.  The only answer for such a group is to play the game more to build an instinct for what works and what doesn't. (90-120 min game)

I enjoy this game that has seen me demolished every time that I play it.  Some of the folks that I play with aren't particularly fond of it though, so it's going on the block.

It would likely never come out again after getting Primordial Soup, so that's fine.

RATING: 4
really thought i'd like this one, but based off one play (one play where i was screwed over on each major scoring round by the guy before me) i'd say there is something broken.  i can't point my finger to what, beyond my example... as i lost out on at least thirty points because of positioning.  i'll give it another play, but if that fairs similarly.. .gone it is.i figured out what this is missing.  i was reading the rules to Way Out West, and i realized that these two games are very similar.  But WoW using an auction to determine player order.  that works so much better!

Wow, I love this game!  A lot of different mechanics (auction, conflict, building, area control) that somehow fit well into one game.  Plays best with 6 people.  I find I really enjoy games that contain some conflict but the conflict is not the primary goal of the game.  People tend to win this game if they can manage to stay out of conflict, not make enemies, and still expand.  Generally, I really think this game is underrated.

oh no.

One of my schticks is that I want a single color of miniatures to be controlled by a single player.  Three of the four characters in this game have overlapping colors in the suggested loadouts in the rulebook.  I may limit these planewalkers to 2-player games for my own sanity, or only allow one multicolor planeswalker in a 4-player game.

I really don't want to have to tear apart mixed-color decks to try to build a monocolor loadout for a dualcolor planeswalkers.  That just doesn't sound fun.

You're getting basically all that you got in the core game, so this is a standalone, but let's be real, most of us are going to own it so we can combine with the other content. Multi-colored Planeswalkers, more figures, more terrain (thank goodness, though it's still a little bland), and more cards and dice. A couple more content packs (including one for more terrain) and this is going to shape up to quite a game.

RATING: 7
My rating is for the entire game [family=38076]family[/family] with enough expansions to allow for true army and deck building (which I would say requires base game, Battle for Zendikar and Shadows over Innistrad). This deviates from my normal policy to rate base games and expansions separately. My rating for just Shadows over Innistrad played as a stand-alone without any expansions would be a 6.
So Shadows over Innistrad was a much needed addition to Arena of the Planeswalkers. It finally allows for real army and spell deck building together with the core game and the Zendikar expansion. :)
The new battlefield scenarios with the new terrain are also welcome additions to the game. I like that two of the scenarios don't just require you to destroy the opponents' planeswalkers, but have at least somewhat deviating goals. I also like that there is a new 1 vs. 2 scenario.
My rating includes a minus for how unclear many of the rule details are and that the designers are not present here on BGG at all to answer rules questions. :(
My rating also includes a minus for the line of sight rules, which I particularly dislike. I much prefer hex based rules which clearly tell you whether a figure will have line of sight or not *before you commit to your movement*. I hate a need for fiddly millimeter decisions with a laser pointer. I also hate that according to the rules, it affects line of sight how you position your figure *within* its hex.

Hoped the faster setup and fewer characters to choose from would speed up play and get this to the table more often than Heroscape. Unfortunately the spell cards—while fun and well-implemented—caused play to bog down each turn as new ones are drawn and analyzed. 

We should've used a turn timer to force faster decisions, but my group just didn't enjoy the extra decision making caused by learning new spell cards when they really just wanted to chuck dice. 

Note: Rulebook includes only one 3-player scenario.

This can be either a standalone game or an expansion to the first game. By itself, I do not like it as much as the original, but if it is an expansion that it will shake things up quite a bit. New characters are added that can use two different kinds of magic, there are more hero creatures, and spell cards that all affect the deck building process. It adds new types of game play. New types of terrain which are used in the different games. I think the manual is very easy to understand. Overall, a great game. If starting out I would recommend the original, but this is a must if you want to expand from the first game. There is also a lot of customization if you want to make your own terrain and game variations.

More of the same "not Heroscape" in this expansion. It's unfortunate to compare it constantly, it's just, not as good and makes me reevaluate how much I honestly like Heroscape for this to not be hitting with me.

This takes the game to a new level with dual coloured planeswalkers, a lot of new cards and a few bits of new terrain. Really, the planeswalkers is the big thing and creates tons of variability.

Personally my favorite block from MtG come to heroscape. Much of the same as the previous sets except with this set the ability to customize your army is much better.

Nice expansion, but the scenarios could be a little bit more creative, this game could still be in a plain board easy to put on the table, but have different locations or even a small dueling campaign. Werewolfs vs Vampires, etc... still, a nice diversity in deck building is made possible with this expansion.

A good addition to the Planeswalker line up. I really like the new characters and their abilities, but feel the cards included with this version are a little too situational and limited in their uses. All in all though when this is combined with the other two sets it finally gives the game the levels of customization its been alluding to.

For the price, this games offers some terrain and a lot of miniatures. I really like this game except for the dice rolls. A strategy is thrown out the window based on dice rolls. In the midst of this, the Magic cards definitely give the illusion that you are mitigating the luck, and that makes this one quite enjoyable. Worth the price.

The new planeswalkers are interesting.  The new units are ok, but getting a bit too tribal (and thus RPS-y) for my taste.  Most of the spells are very poor, making them pointless when mixing sets but ok when played alone.

I do like how they used the obelisks to create height differential with minimal terrain components.

With the 2nd expansion, the game is starting to have enough content to play large enough games that there is real spatial maneuvering, not just dice chuking and spell chucking.  This expansion per se isn't super special, but the extra volume of units in every color, plus multi-color planeswalkers, makes the game much closer to the glory of its heroscape roots.

Not played yet but this looks awesome. More planeswalkers, heroes, squads, cards, terrain types... all awesome.

I am a little concerned that the dual-color planeswalkers will make the single-color planeswalkers obsolete. The dual-color ones have a ton more options of which cards and squad/hero creatures to use, and they don't have any real drawback that I can see. You would expect them to have weaker stats or a much higher point cost but they seem to be on par with the other planeswalkers. I would be interested to see how a team of two single-color planeswalkers stands up against a team of two dual-color planeswalkers.

Excited to give this a try, will rate after playing.

Even if this is the last Arena of the Planeswalkers box set released, I'm content with the state of the game.  Between this set and the original base set, I have nine playable Planeswalkers with corresponding decks and armies.  Unless tournaments for this game start popping up (highly unlikely), I'm more interested in a game I can pull off the shelf and play immediately using set army lists than having a highly customizable game that requires each player to be familiar with spell deck and army construction.  For this reason, I hope future expansions follow the same trend as this one, being released as stand-alone games.

The biggest letdown in this set was Jace being one of the four Planeswalkers.  I dislike him as a character and now I have two versions of him.  However, the inclusion of two of my favorite Planeswalkers, Nahiri and Arlinn Kord, more than makes up for him.

The main thing lacking at this point is more terrain.  In particular, better ruins to block LOS (a la HeroScape) and terrain offering defensive modifiers versus ranged combat.

Old adventure-type game with some interesting bits. The comic-style adventures are cool and the way you run away from stuff is great. For the most part, it seems kind of clunky and it runs longer than it feels like it should.

An easy game, but very fun and dripping with theme.  Think: [i]Land of the Lost[/i] in a board game.  Lots of variability from game to game and a clever mechanic to boot.  Totally awesome that you play out numerous cartoon strips in each game (trust me -- try it!).  Challenging strategy, yet easy enough for a child to play.

RATING: 5
Good theme but... player interaction is low: however that's usually the case with games that have solo play. Once the major principles are understood, the pace accelerates, although downtime still peaks when another player goes through an Adventure. Experience will tell you which equipment is more likely to help when starting a game. The Adventure sheets are well-drawn in a clean comic-book style but they contrasts with the gameboard's fuzzy color graphics. A bit of humour sprinkled in the game's illustrations allows the game to not feel too dry as it tries to appeal to younger players, but the game fails at that in my opinion. Although the game features varied and interesting mechanics, there are just too many for one game, and it "feels" heavy. I just think this game could have been more streamlined.

... Thinking of letting it go.

RATING: 7
This was a surprisingly entertaining game with a number of tactical decisions needed.

Although it may initially appear to be a simple roll and move game it actually plays on a number of different levels.  The track around the outside determines what actions you can take and how far you can move.  As you move your pawn around the plateau you turn over the card covering the hex (easily the worst component in the game, too thin and fiddly); you may discover equipment, an angry dinosaur or an adventure site.  At and adventure sight you move onto a comic-book like card of frames and roll to see which frame you move to. The randomness of this is mitigated by cards you have collected which can be used to modify your die roll.

A good fun game that is just a tad long for what it is.

Amazing story board based adventures. Keeping track of your exp/loot/equipment has a very RPG feel to it. I'd strongly recommend playing with a more generous experience generating variant. Also to spend the game up with 3-4 players take out half of the "Nothing Here" unexplored tiles.

RATING: 5.5
Okay roll-and-move game that feels like another game called Source of the Nile.  This game is more suited for kids and teens, though.  Too much rolling and randomness for not enough progress (i.e. slow game).  Has a bit of a Galaxy Trucker feeling since you equip your adventurers and hope for the best... frequently you end up surrendering your items in failed challenges or dropping your equipment to haul a$s so you can escape a carnivorous dinosaur that is stalking you.  Amusing but not strategic enough to belong in my collection.

By myself, I would give the game a 7, but my boys loved it and we had great times together.  Good story line, and the game tied in with the book/movie well.  Was able to introduce some evolution/religion discussion as well.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A fun game from the past with a great theme.  If you grew up watching Land of the Lost or liked to pretend you were explorers to an unknown land this game is for you.

Certain elements of the game are really great, like the comic book style adventure cards and planning which tools your party will carry.  Other elements could have been better.  Most noticeable is the victory conditions which require your expedition to find a method of escape from the plateu.  The methods of escape can be difficult to find/execute and this just makes the game last 30 mins too long.

It's definitely worth the occational play and it's a great game to play with your kids.  Seriously, what kid dosen't like dinosaurs?

Pretty decent given how old the game is. This is basically a better Talisman. You roll and move around a track, try to avoid getting beaten by dinosaurs, and collect VPs.

RATING: 7
This is a surprisingly good game, but it could have used a little more development.

Players have to be careful about using resources, so it requires some planning.  They have to keep their goals in mind, otherwise other expeditions will reach the goal first -- escaping the Lost World -- and win the game.  There's plenty of strategy in figuring out how to navigate through the Lost World and how to avoid or engage with other expeditions.  And there's asome randomness, which will foil any plan.  These are all aspects of this game that set it apart from others if its ilk, like MONSTERS RAVAGE AMERICA or several of the pirate games out there.

The game is really engaging and the graphic Adventures are a cool mechanic I don't think I've seen anywhere else.  My kids love this game because it's full of dinosaurs; I like it too because it's full of interesting choices.

That said, there are some developmental issues with the game.  First, the text on the cards is in very small print, maybe 6 point.  There's a lot there and it's tough to read.  Not only is that problematic from a visual standpoint, but there's a lot of content on the cards.  They take a long time to read for little gain.

The Discovery tiles are pretty flimsy.  If they'd been made a little more sturdy, I think that would have been nice.

There are some areas where the rules could have been tightened up quite a bit.

Overall, this is a solid game and definitely worth the effort to find and play.

Fun game based very closely on Arthur Conan Doyle's story "The Lost World".  Players are trapped on an unexplored plateau and the dinosaurs want to say howdy.

An underestimated gem.

This game is a lot of fun, but can be a long game. Lots of cool dinos, to eat your friends with and the chase is always fun too, so long as you're not the one being chased.

I'd of liked to see some dino minis in the game, but the cardboard standups aren't to bad and the race through the comic strips is a nice little touch, that adds a good touch of flavor to the game.

RATING: 7
Overall a worthwhile purchase for those with younger family members, sure there are many choices now, but not many that are that much better. It will introduce them to many mechanics of wargames early with an easy to comprehend theme. It will also introduce friends to some historic boardgaming as well. The board is so like monopoly on initial cursory glance that many will mistake it for something like that. Whilst the game itself will surprise those that you teach. As a solitaire, its a bit of fun, there is some replayability, that will be hampered by the overall lack of strategic depth though. But in a large collection of solitaire games, where variety is build-in numbers of games owned, this is one title that can be pulled out from time to time for its unique theme and innovative mechanics.

I will give this game a solid 7 out of 10, recommended for those with an interest in some Avalon Hill history and find the theme interesting.

+7 for the unique adventure mechanic, the use of different "gameboards" is so much better done than say "Talisman", and a good demonstration that linear dice rolling track games don't necessarily mean Snakes and Ladders. The command activation system is ahead of its time and is a precursor to Card Driven Games of today. Also points given for the excellent narrative & theme. And most of all how everything seems to just work so well together.

-3 for the fact that its a light family game, which makes it strategically not too deep, but unlike B-17, despite the randomness of many die rolls, there remains some decision making, which is a redeeming quality of this excellent title, especially when compared to B-17. The theme is a little on the immature side, but anyone growing up watching TV in the 70s & 80s would instantly be familiar with the often used theme. The components aren't up to modern standards, but that is only expected.

This was a thrift find for $1.  It took a long time to read and understand the directions, but it was actually a fun game once we got started.  It does take about 2 hours to play, but we thought it was worth it.  You get to move around and explore areas for dinosaurs.  Sometimes you have to run from T-rex.  You also get to do these mini quests that are on sheets and kinda like a choose your own adventure.

Never thought when I bought it that this game would be so good. Exciting, suspenseful and challenging. I use miniature Dinos to enhance the experience of the Explorers. Update 2010: Due to all my friends LOVING this game I expanded all the pieces and added new realistic creatures (replacing the toy-looking ones) that I added paint to. I also made counters so everyone has their own tool counters that added a new dimension to a really Great game.

「失われた世界」を探検するゲームとしては、文句の付けようがない。特にコミックブックには入り込んだように進める探検チャートが非常によい。

未探索タイルの配置はランダムだし、装備品も自分で自由に選べて、毎回新鮮な気持ちで遊ぶことが出来る。一部の装備品は探検だけでなく、イベントでのトラブル回避に役立つので、装備品の組み合わせだけでも、ゲームの難易度を調整することが可能だ。

プレイ人数は４人でも十分楽しめるが、３人までの方がイベントカードのシャッフルが発生しなくて良いと思う。

強いて難点を挙げるならば、ゲームを普段遊ばない人を面食らわせるには十分なほどに、ゲーム中のマスを示す用語が多いことだろうか。

This is really a fun game, particularly if played with the right crowd and in the right spirit. Definitely very luck dependent with all the dice rolling, but some skill is involved as you select tools to help you in your adventure and potentially select adventures which best fit the tools.  The dinosaur chases can be quite entertaining as well.  This is really quite a straightforward game to play where the rules appear much more verbose and complex than they need to be.

Hilarious attempt by AH to make a kid-friendly game complete with hexes and teeny, tiny small-print rules. As a testament to the pathetic game market prior to the internet the box advertises its 'Rules for Solitaire Play.' Even a kid's game in the late 80s had to be solitaire suitable to sell apparently. Nevertheless, this is pretty amusing if you throw in a bottle of wine and the right attitude.

RATING: 7.5
This is a perfect game to use to introduce young players to games that actually require thought, planning and strategy. The game has several variations from a very simple see who uncovers the most dinosaurs to pulling off a very advanced expedition into the Lost World.

And don't brush this off as a simple children's game. With the advanced rules in play this game can be a very captivating game for adults. And it also plays very well as a solo game. With a variety of game types, random placement and random events this game offers a great deal of replayability. The Lost World is a lost gem.

Fun! A great mix of strategy and luck...with dinosaurs!

I like the comic book panels: It's a neat idea and interesting way to add variety to the adventures. It really works and requires both planning and luck. You can take your time, accumulate experience cards and go into adventures well-prepared, or you can push your luck, or anywhere in between.

It really gives you the feeling of participating in a classic old movie about intrepid adventurers traipsing through lost worlds fighting dinosaurs, encountering natives, overcoming obstacles and competing to be the first to report on their discoveries.

Complaints about luck are nonsensical to me: This is a B-Movie type of game with native tribes, dinosaurs, apemen and carnivorous plants. It's got frickin' comic book panels. It would suck harder than an aging porn star if you tried to make it "serious" and "skillful" like some nightmarishly dull worker placement game. You'll run from the dinosaur, and you'll like it!

And don't let the comments about downtime fool you. The chase minigame is really quick, and once you get the hang of the adventures, they go quickly as well. If you have the patience of a gnat or a hyperactive 3-year-old, maybe this will be a problem. But compared to the flavor of the moment Euro downtime as the Grand Poobah of Toiletries and Beans agonizes over how many brown cubes to invest in squirrel habitats, DotLW is nothing. Seriously, nothing. And watching your opponents fall into lava, get chased by dinosaurs, etc., is actually fun.

The theme and atmosphere are compelling. And to think how long ago this came out. Very nice.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.33
The scenario cards an interesting idea, but too many movement cards makes them too easy to survive.  My boy liked it when we played, and should probably bring it out again for him.  A lot of text on some of those cards makes it tougher for the younger folks.

Aug '16:  About six years since I last played.  Went at it solo and had a good time in about an hour.  I won on turn 30 with 27 points and got off using the tarpaulin at the geyser.  The volcano countdown was on, addi extra excitement with each roll.  Simple game, but it is fun, maybe more to me than it really should, but I would not turn down a game.  I need to try it with my son again.

RATING: 7
Dinosaurs of the Lost World is a rough gem. It has a strong theme and an exciting atmosphere. Players will find that the Lost World is a perilous place. Preparation and courage is needed as there's a fine balance between pushing one's luck and careful strategy. 

I really love the comic book adventures, the item management and the modular map. With the right attitude and a focus on theme and fun I think it's a great game. At the same time some of the mechanics and outcomes, such as losing a turn, are dated.

Atmospheric, beautifully faithful to Doyle's book, but unfortunately mostly a luck-fest.

Great older game that's as much about preparing for the adventure (what gear do you pack in your limited carry space onto the ancient plateau filled with dinosaurs?) as tracking and trapping the lizards. 

Allows P2P combat! But is using your valuable ammunition on other human parties worth it when there are bigger beasts abound?

RATING: 7
Surprisingly good with some unique gameplay in the comic book-style story panels for the Adventures.  Poor components, especially the paper thin map tiles with their generic white tops.  They cover a good chunk of the map and really take away from the visual appeal.  Considering making my own and adding plastic dinosaurs and explorer minis...

Also, would have liked to have seen more thematic ties to Doyle's "Lost World" - only a passing reference to the Maple White Expedition in the game.  Would be nice to play as Prof. Challenger instead of Explorer A.

Despite it all, I wouldn't turn down a game of this and would love to see a remake with better components.

I had this as a kid - I don't think we quite understood how to play it, unfortunately, as it's got a leg up on most kids games. Having played it again, I had a good time going through the adventures and exploring the lost plateau. Scores huge points on execution of theme, loses points for the somewhat gamey way the experience cards work with the adventures. Scores gender points for having prominent female characters, loses gender points for the event where you lose a turn because the woman is looking for pretty jewels.

A rarity, being an Avalon Hill game aimed at children. Based on Conan Doyle's 'Lost World'. Typically verbose AH rules, this game has enough choices and variation to make it playable by adults who want a light competitive game with an Indy-type adventure with dinosaurs (who doesn't?).

The board, divided into hexes to explore, represents the plateau which the adventurers have discovered and from which they must now escape. Adventures are experienced via comic-strip-style mini stories, some of which provide the means to escape and win.

RATING: 6
A decent game but with many of the 'adventures' being too dangerous to be attempted frequently and the starting equipment list gets stereotyped. Can be played 'friendly' or very 'cut-throat'. Has aspects of 'push your luck' in that careful collection and use of Movement cards will minimize risk but will take time; a lucky dice roller can add a lot of pressure to the rest of the group. It's also fairly common for some players to be denied the required exit item. Need to play again as it's been at least a decade.

This game produces incredible stories... and that's where my people are at. Clunky at times (especially things related to "camp") but thematic as all get out. Maybe you think of Axis & Allies or Fortress America when you think of Ameritrash... but Dinosaurs of the Lost World fits that bill perfectly.

My kids loved this game, played it to absolute death. Box is beat to hell, playing pieces worn to a nub. After I played it about twenty times or so, it started to rank up there with Candyland. It did get my kids interested in boardgames. Now residing in peace in a plastic tub down in my basement.

If players don't 'play nice' the death spiral here could result in a game that could take a very long time. I hear it's not a bad solo game, and I would play it again solo to find out, but with others I'll pass. This game is busted, all nostalgia.

This is a personal favorite that hit the "sweet spot" before I got into recent, Euro-style games.  This game is still imaginative and worth an occasional play in spite of its age.  Overall, "Dinosaurs" is an underrated game that is not wholly deserving of the comments in this BGG log that claim it depends only on luck or takes too long to play.

I would love to see an updated version.

Fun, crazy, luck-heavy game set in the 'Lost World'. Players are running expeditions trying to get 25VPs before getting out of the darn place.

The catch? There are dinosaurs and other nasty events lurking and there to halt the players' progress. The entire game has several layers built in. There's an external monopoly-like track that determines player movement on an inner hex-grid. The monopoly-track also doles out events, initiates dino movement, etc.

The heart of the game is moving expeditions through the central hex board, flipping over unexplored hexes, and having adventures. The 15 adventures are cleverly encountered in the 'comic book' format. Pawns roll a D6 and move across the adventure. The 3rd subsystem is a 'chase' track. Anytime an expedition battles a dino and loses, they get chased down a track on the board. Movement is determined by D6 rolls. If the dino catches up, players lose an item or a VP if they haven't got items to drop. They get booted back to camp and lose a turn. Truly punishing.

The game has a solitaire mode where players have 40 turns to get 25VPs and bust out. Or they draw if they survive. Otherwise, it's death.

Frustrating moments abound and dice luck plays a heavy part of the game. Still, good fun as long as no-one takes it too seriously.

I can't believe how much of a let-down this game is.  It looks so cool.  I love the map, the comic adventures are fun, and the chase is totally entertaining, but the pace and the kludgy movement system is unforgivable.  It is so easy to have turn after turn of nothing worthwhile happening while other people have fun adventures, this is all made far worse by the overwhelming amount of opportunities there are to "lose your turn."  Losing your turn in this game is really a minimum tantamount to losing two turns rather than having anything happen this turn, instead, nothing happens and then you can't play another turn later.  YUCK. 

There are so many dead tiles in the game that you can have turn after turn of discovering nothing, or worse, discovering "lose a turn."  It can take forever to move anywhere on the map, so when an event sends you back to the camp, it may mean 4 or 5 turns before you can reach anywhere of potential interest again.  The game punishes unlucky players by not allowing them to actually play the game.

So, all the stuff that is cool can easily be kept at arms length.  This is all made worse by the uneven length to the turns.  If someone is having an adventure, they may get a 5 minute turn, so you could end up waiting an interminable amount of realtime minutes before seeing anything worthwhile happen if you are sent back to camp and have to lose a turn.

The design is actually pretty close to being loads of fun.  Perhaps if someone updated the design, it would be worth playing again, but as it stands, this just isn't worth my valuable limited game time.

One of my friends owns this, and we play occasionally.  It's not a fantastic game, but can be a lot of fun.  I find that it's necessary to take some risks, though.  If you play it safe, you can avoid trouble and have a boring game.  Come on - don't use that card, ROLL THE DICE!

This game is a lot of fun, especially played with a single expedition as a cooperative family game. Read Arthur Conan Doyle's classic The Lost World to your kids, and then teach them this game. I did both, and we had countless hours of fun together as a result. When playing competitively, the game is fine with two expedtions, but playing with more than two makes for a long game, too long for the type of game it is.

picked up a brand new amazing! just like off the shelf from your favorite old hobby store. Played my friends game. Now I looking for some small dinosaurs that are in the game, about two or even 3" tall, any body got a line on such a "COMMON" item. LOL! Fun Fun Fun! get some kids in the mix even one or two and all of a sudden everyone is a kid no one acts over 10. Some even act 5 and that's the 35 year olds. "Waaa, you guys are picking on me. Lots of laughs. I feel very lucky and privilaged to own such a game. Especially with grand kids moving up the age line. I started preparing games to play with them since they were born. 

And yes I have more family games such as Leaping Lemmings. If you have kids or grand kids get this before it's gone. I guarantee there will be no second printing. I may buy 4 or 5 more for the poor folks that didn't pay any attention. There is absolutely nothing finer than listening to a child laugh cause they just "GOT YOU"

Too bad Dinosaurs of the Lost world is so rare! Now where do I find some of those little boogers?

Capture the spirit of the "Lost World" type exploration. Can recommend to younger players. But even Don Greenwood (the designer) admitted that the game had balance issues that one adventure has less danger and more reward.

This is a really great game for 7-12 year old boys. While it's unpolished and takes longer than it should, you can feel the spirit of adventure as you choose equipment,  explore the lost plateau, and run from hungry carnosaurs. The comic book-pane adventure boards add a unique storytelling mechanic, and the random setup means a different game every time.

Narrative-based lighter game that is appropriate for families, and for groups looking for a thematic and largely luck-driven experience.  Mechanically, there's a lot in common with [gameid=714], but you have a lot more control, and the game isn't as long.  The adventures, drawn in comic style, are a real treat.  If games like [gameid=34119] are interesting to you, this is a good choice.

The exploration was great and the comic book styled adventures were a neat approach.  The interaction between the movement track and the plateau was interesting, as was the dinosaur chases.  However, the game was often bogged down by uneventful turns and repetitive actions.  Not to mention it was plagued by bash-the-leader problem, even when it was clear the session has gone on way too long, it took tremendous effort for the winning player to get to the spot and complete the adventure to escape.  Nice concepts but not really all that fun to play through.  Definitely outdated in comparison to a lot of the newer releases.

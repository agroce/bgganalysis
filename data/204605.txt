I very much enjoy this game.  There really is nothing like it on the market.  It is a cooperative tactical game involving variable board set up.  The characters/heros that the players choose to be also drastically alter the game play and strategy.  

There are may pros.  The replayability of the game is very high due to the variable set up and the different characters that will be on the board each game.  There are dice, but I would argue that the luck if the dice can be mitigated.  Part of the game is building up troops so that you have more dice to roll.  However, it is hard to travel with large numbers of troops.  It is a fun puzzle to figure out how to transport troops efficiently to a battle.  The game feels different than others on the market.  The action point allowance is inter sting.  

One big con is that the game is quite lengthy to set up.  Also, the game takes up a huge area on the table.  Really, this game and the Secrets of the Lost Tomb take up the most room on my table.  One of the heros is a stripper sort of looking female with a money garter on her leg (with money attached).  The game seems to be set in a middle age fantasy anime world, and I felt this hero was out of place and tacky.  

Apart from these cons, I love the game. I do not like war games, which does not impact my enjoyment of the game whatsoever. The tactical decisions in this game are fantastic.

A game for me that looks great and plays like no other game I have. Unicornus Knights weakness is its rule book it seems to have been rushed though the translation and could have been better. So the learning curve is long and the first play though can be messy, but that's part of the appeal and charm for me, as was learning the game "Dorasure" that is still only in Japan.

A really satisfying game. 

It's nice to see a cooperative game with predictable enemy actions, with the event deck providing just enough uncertainly. Enough moving parts that everyone can focus on their own actions, avoiding the alpha player problem.

Has a really elegant, satisfying, and quick method of combat resolution.

Seems to scale well up to 6 players.

On our first play we had trouble with the rules, and this is a game you WILL lose the first time with that rocky start and how much you need to actually strategize to win you won't understand right away.  I do really look forward to my next attempt on it, but I fear that rough first game may leave this one unrequested for a time.

We played this at a convention. The game has too many things happening
all over a huge play area. It's as if the designer had so many ideas
and wanted to cram it all into one game. There are some novel ideas in
this game however it was hampered by the implementation.

From the beginning, setup was a beast. Three people setting up took
around 15 minutes. Once play began we immediately
felt the rules begin to drag us down. Just moving your character
around to get in position to do something was a chore. In the end we
won but we felt no satisfaction in it which is strange. My guess is
that we were worried we must have missed something because there were too
many things to keep track.

Given the right circumstances I can see this being fun for a group who
enjoys the theme and the novelty of it. However after a few plays the
design flaws will become pronounced and will discourage further
games. Definitely not a game that will stand the test of time.

We struggled to grasp the attack/defend rules (ENG rulebook) which took up a long time, and then we lost in the third round (dragon ate princess). But we really liked the theme and the RPG characters seemed well-balanced and interesting to play. We definitely wish to play again, and think it will grow more on us as we play. The way the Fate cards worked was very novel and entertaining.

This is a cooperative game in which you have to escort the Princess in her endeavor to retake her kingdom. While doing so you will battle various enemies with the option to recruit them as allies.

I like this game in large part due to its variability. The event cards make each round interesting and the fate cards make every enemy unique and fun to try to recruit.  Adding them as allies also make your heroes unique.

The cooperative part of the game works well as your characters each have unique abilities and you have to put each in the right place where they can be of most use. Also sacrificing a hero at the right time is sometimes a tactically solid option.

I love the theme and art of this game and the components are all of high quality. The game is pretty easy to teach as it doesn't have too many rules and everything makes sense thematically.

The first game was on the long side which made fighting the units tedious. But once you get the rules down the playtime decreases significantly and it helps to keep the game going at a good pace.

This is like a tactical minis cooperative battle game where you are trying to get the Princess to safety on the other side of the map. You choose your party but the party must be balanced. Kind of seems like a potentially better version of Andor, though I want Andor also. I want dis one now.

This game is fun as long as you don't take it remotely seriously.  Embrace its over the top anime qualities and absurdity.  Get your character involved in as many ridiculous fate webs as possible.  Don't worry about the actual game too much because it's not very good.

First game was a blast. Lot of fun and laughs. The board is beautiful, artworks on the character cards awesome. The theme is present and the progress towards the capital is visible. we won this first game (on the 10th and last turn), which brought concerns on replayability. In any case, a second game will hopefully follow soon. Might become my favourite heavy coop.

Edit: After second game, still a lot of fun. The game tends to be quite long (2,5 to 3 hours with setup and cleaning). The second game was a win again. Some character abilities seems overpowered when combined. The atmosphere around the table when playing is still memorable. The game reminds me of tactical RPG videogames.

I dig this game. It plays differently from most co-op games; you have a longer planning horizon here. You can see most of what you'll need to do from the start of the game and can make long-term plans. Most co-op games I feel like I'm just putting out fires and can't plan more than about one turn in advance.

Simple, pleasant, it portrays nicely the story.
The fixed length (10 rounds) is enough to build a narrative arc without getting stale.
Some luck (adds variance bewtween games and some need to adapt to the situtation) and some decisions.
The objective to win the war, but also doing so by protecting the Princess, adds a nice twist.

We played this game at the AEG Big Game night at GEN CON.  There was a group of six of us and we had an instructor from AEG there to teach us the game.

While the game itself has a lot of potential and could be really fun, the rules are horrible.  It doesnt take a lot of effort to find contradictions in the rule book between what the rules say and what the examples show.  We kept running into scenarios where the rules gave no guidance.  Our instructor didnt know the answers to some of the scenarios we ran into.  For example, what happens if a monster attacks you and looses on the rolls.  Does the monster really then kill itself?  

Game play for the six of us took four hours and we didnt even finish the game.  So frustrating.

The problem seems to be that this was a game originally published in Japan.  There seems to be a lot lost in the translation of the rules.

AEG released this game before it was ready.  The company really needs to go back through the rule book with some of their game players and flush out all of the rules that are unclear, rules the contradict the examples and rules that are missing.  A new book would absolutely improve this game that I think is otherwise bound to be a failure.

RATING: 5
Enjoyable enough. This is Seiji Kanai's take on the action point allowance co-op idea, and while it is pretty fun for what it is, the luck factor is pretty heavy-handed. Not only is the board fairly randomized at the start, but it's quite a dice-chucker. 

I'm not sure why Kanai is so fascinated by dice lately. Eight Epics had dice, and it was also pretty flawed mechanically. I feel like he needs to stick to creative card play, which is where he excels. This game definitely has that, but the action cards are pretty typical, and the event cards range from harmless to bad. The Fate Cards are where this game really gains a unique aspect. Much like one of the designer's other games, Say Bye to the Villains, there is a chance that a villain may end up switching sides under certain circumstances. There are other special occurrences that can come up, but these make each game have a slightly different flavor to it.

Where the game ultimately fails for me, however, is that this game has the theme of something along the lines of Heroes of Might and Magic, but feels like a weird, abstracted light war game. Essentially what you do on your turn amounts to finding a good balance between troops and resources. Your troops allow you to defeat enemies, and you use resources to move yourself and your troops across the map. That's it. You defeat people along the way, and ultimately want to get the princess to the capital. There really isn't much variation beyond the Fate Cards, playable characters, and what enemy characters are in each game. What bothers me though is that the more troops you have, the more you push your luck to do more damage, but also risk taking more damage yourself.

It's a good puzzle, and the design is fairly unique, but I don't know that this is one I want to experience further. The dice rolls are quite draining, and the game is missing...something. I'm not quite sure what. The game is fine, but bottom line: If you don't roll well, you won't win.

I really enjoyed this game, but the rule book is fairly flawed. It's pretty, has nice character bios and a comic strip; but the rules are fairly scattered, wordings on cards don't match the clarifications in the rule book, not enough clarifications, and so on. It took us about an hour and a half to sit down learn the rules and set up before we actually started playing. The hardest thing for us to understand was the way the princess moves, so we just did our best there and it seemed to make sense.

Once playing it was really fun. It's interesting that you can speed up or slow down the princess as she rushes to get to the throne by either giving her more soldiers (which are expensive to move so it takes longer for her to gather resources and move forward) or giving her loads up money (so she can pay to move her units for every action). At first we were concerned that game would be short with 10 rounds, or that we wouldn't be able to beat it, but we won on round 9. Just enough of a challenge. We did get lucky in some ways so I think that on other playthroughs with tiles located differently this game could get pretty difficult.

This game just did not click with us, which is a shame because I enjoyed the theme and liked the characters. It's the pesky, awkward, awful dice-rolling mechanics. You hurt yourself more often than not when performing combat, so you're forced to play this more like a puzzle. Not a puzzle I enjoy, unfortunately.

Cooperative war game. I think that makes it unique. 
The only concern I have with it is it's kind of static and feels like it needs an expansion or something to keep every game from being similar.
Since it comes from Japan, that's probably not happening.

I was interested in this game for a while, the concept and art seemed promising.

Played it at gencon and it was a hot mess. The rulebook was awful and the game went on way way too long, took 3 hours to finish and no one was having fun. 
The biggest issue the way resources, armies, and movement are tied to each other really bog down the game and also lead to players wasting turns. Could have been a very good game if they playtested it more and made the mechanics smoother and less punishing.

Had an absolute blast with this game, which is essentially a co-op strategy game escort mission.  Played/taught this one 3 times during the con (actually 4 times if you count the game where the princess died on the first round!).  The rules took a little figuring out; in particular the combat rules were a little confusing but things became clear over the course of the first game.  The theme is fun, I like the artwork, and I like the level of thematic detail on certain little things like how you can't just send supplies to someone without sending them a trooper to carry those supplies.  Also beating up the enemy bosses to get them to (maybe) join your side was fun.

The variation on the map setup, enemy character behavior, player character options with different role focus, and adjustable difficulty by way of how you build the event card deck and which princess card you play with really adds a lot of replay value.

While the turn pacing felt pretty quick to me, I think the sweet spot is probably for 4 players for time and game balance.  While the game supports up to 6 players, your time between turns will start to get longer with 5 or 6 players, which might not be to some players' taste.

Some of the iconography is hard to read on the map tiles.  The setup and playtime is pretty long.  I felt like the game went fast--it didn't feel like three hours, but it was (including teaching).  I think the 2 hour playtime on the box is a fair estimate for a complete game (as in, if you don't lose early on) once everyone knows how to play.  Those things combined keep me from giving this a higher score, but as I said I really enjoyed it.  Picked up a copy and hope my home group likes it, too!

Family oriented girl power with co-op standees area movement across a random bubbled-hexed fantasy realm to escort the relentless AI Princess to take back her Empire. I like the immersed narrative and charm woven into the characters, encounter templates, and support and fate cards. Interesting way to adjust difficulty with the Princess character templates.  Clever but involved modified combat system to adjust hits and misses and their effect on the result.

An original take on Co-op, you have one dummy player that needs to get safely from point A to B. Your job is to clear the way or position yourself to guide her away from danger. The rules aren't bad, but not totally clear either. I do find it a bit hard to track everything on the board, as you really should check what each enemy does. If it would show things more clearly I'd give it a 7.

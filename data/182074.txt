Area majority point-salad game.  Maybe a little over-complicated for what it is.  The track iconography is really poor, but every other part of the presentation is good.  Like the "time-track"-style turn order, even though it meant for some long downtime, periodically.  +1 point for interesting common scoring mechanism, across the "salad."  Almost seems like it should have had some sort of mid-game scoring, though.

RATING: 6
Antarctica's scoring system is reminiscent of Kardinal und Konig/Web of Power.  While the way that this game is played is quite different, this did lead me to unfavourably compare its somewhat overwrought mechanisms with that streamlined classic's.  For instance, what do the eight building types really add? On the plus side, there are some interesting things going on in Antarctica, such as dispensing with normal turn order.  Instead, the sun moves from zone to zone and whoever has a ship in the leading berth in the sun's zone takes a turn.  There is competition for  control of the most developed areas and for the lead on five exploration tracks.  There is plenty to do, but turns do assume a certain repetitiveness during the game's 90 minute playing time.

Production quality is good, while the artwork is neither memorable nor offensive.

Good game and nice mechanic but which can make you wait for your next turn a very long time... a huge and very boring flaw, too annoying to make this a really good game.

RATING: 7
Uses a unique turn activation and scoring mechanism.  Planning for future turns is required and can be challenging depending on what resources you have access to and what building cards are up.  At its core, the game is an area majority design with several areas to compete in.  Because the scoring, it may be best to jump into an area and claim 2nd or 3rd place and get cheap VP.   The game end conditions can cause problems in rare (?) Situations, so note the errata.  Overall, it's an I threshing game worth trying.  Especially for its turn activation approach.

RATING: 8
Really interesting scoring mechanisms, rondel-like action selection and nice components make for an enjoyable game, but one that will shift up quite a lot as you proceed through different players' turns. So it's not necessarily going to appeal to some gamers who want consistent balance to all their actions, but nevertheless it's really neat and feels unique to play.

Ever since Yunnan, I've come to expect solid and well developed games from Argentum Verlag and this title didn't disappoint. Like Yunnan, the game feels like it adds innovation while maintaining tense and interesting decisions.

Antarctica's basic mechanic is area control intertwined within area control while at the same time having a unique turn order mechanism. Seeming at first glance like a tactical exercise, the game reveals an interesting layer of strategical depth after a few turns.

The game can be brutal at times, but in the end it's fun and engaging with great components and solid gameplay.

Man, area control with a rondel and worker placement, this is a very awesome game.  I love how you can be pretty creative, work the tactical with an eye on the end game and further actions down the road.  It is very different from many games.  I think the rating could increase.

Boring, repetitive game with a very interesting, though convoluted, area majority/point scoring system. 

I feel like this was a missed opportunity, because the core mechanics are good, except you just do the same thing over and over again. I wish the buildings had more special powers when you built them, both to speed up the game a little and make your decisions more interesting. As it stands, each turn feels exactly the same, so I'm left feeling... meh.

The last few years, Argentum has been a favorite publisher for me, as they straddle the space of medium-light family/gamer Euros with beautiful illustrations and components, and Antarctica continues this trend. This is a tactical mancala-esque area majorities game, with an interesting turn order mechanism similar to which I have seen very few times before. The scoring mechanism reminds me of China, if you cannot get first majority, advancing your position in the category simply gives points to your opponents. Props for those two mechanisms. The game takes a couple of playthroughts to see how the system works and start playing with any competence. Not really a family game, more of a gamers medium-light game. The gameplay itself is all about positioning and looking ahead, so if you enjoy these characteristics you will enjoy it. Theme-wise, it is very thin, but it looks great on the table.

All in all a solid game, but for the moment middle of the pack. Perhaps a bit of wait is in order to see whether this will get play time or not.

Antarctica delivers what it promised. It's a highly interactive, vicious little game with a great table presence. Some people are complaining that the different buildings are vestigial, I think they add a certain something, and it's not like you can complain that it added unnecessary cost as this game is dirt cheap. The scoring also seems to have riled some people, but I think that it's brilliant and really meshes well with the turn order mechanic creating an interesting puzzle. I can see this getting a lot of play in the next year.

Nice game with somewhat unique mechanisms. It's a mix of strategy and tactics, while good play should tend towards more tactical play. Just don't put your ships on a third space all the time, even if that may fit your strategy best. Go for faster play and hence, more influence.

Keep in mind that the game can end quickly, so watch your opponents!

RATING: 8
Nice design.  I like the way the ships get moved, the effortless way that turn order is variable, and the low-cube-count but nontrivial area majority scoring, and the way that the area majority unforgivingly gives a nice fat prize to first place, and little for the others, in each region and each track.  I like the way a whole interesting subgame develops, with very few rules, from the bonus spaces on the research tracks.  Unfortunately you can't solve your puzzle-like turn ahead of time, so other players' turns are mostly downtime.  Therefore I'll bet that 3 players is the best count, not the 4 that my one game was with.

Antarctica tries very hard to be street credible euro, but after an hour of play it becomes painstakingly obvious that it is something completely different. Inlaid mechanics are actually super simple. You move, you take action, that's it. Still, the board is cluttered with seemingly useless tokens and cards and buildings and whatnot. Scoring is basically retarded in every imaginable way, where majority holder scoops a jackpot and the rest fight for scraps. And to top it all of, this torture last for hours. Never again.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

I'd play again but I don't need to own it. The board sure does get cluttered by the end of the game and the rules aren't always totally clear on some aspects of the game although we figured it out by reading up on BGG. In scoring majorities, it pays significantly more to be in first place than later in rank. Your ships are basically your action markers and indicate which region you are taking one of four actions (construct building, research, build ship, recruit scientists).  The sun marker rotates around the board counterclockwise (annoying but thematic?) activating the first ship only in the region which then moves to another region to take an action.

Habe das Spiel auf der Spiel 2015 getestet. Mein Fazit nach dieser einen Partie: Mir gefällt der Mechanismus mit der Sonne, der bestimmt welche Schiffe durch die Spieler bewegt werden können, ansonsten hat mich dieses Spiel im ersten Anlauf noch nicht überzeugen können. Gestört haben mich vor allem die Gebäudekarten, die sehr verschieden stark waren. Die zu erfüllenden Voraussetzungen für den Bau bestimmen ob und wo ich ein Gebäude errichten darf. Das passt soweit ganz gut, aber das große Problem sind meiner Meinung nach die vollkommen willkürlich erscheinenden Boni oder Belohnungen, die die Spieler für das Errichten erhalten. Die Anzahl der einzusetzenden Wissenschaftler ist die eine Sache, aber die zusätzlichen Schritte, die die Spieler auf der Entwicklungsleisten erhalten, stehen scheinbar in keinem Verhältnis. Mal gibt es gar keine Schritte, dann plötzlich gleich zwei. Vollkommen unabhängig davon wann oder von welchem Stapel das Gebäude aufgedeckt wurde. Hat ein Spieler Pech, ist gerade kein Gebäude verfügbar was zusätzliche Schritte auf der Entwicklungsleiste erlaubt. Andere haben Glück und bekommen nicht nur die zusätzlichen Schritte "geschenkt" sondern dazu auch noch einen Stern,  der die Gebäudekarte nochmals wertvoller macht. So kann schnell ein großes Ungleichgewicht entstehen, dass in meinen Augen nicht so recht zu dem ansonsten doch eher strategisch anmutenden Aufbau des Spieles passen will. Auf den ersten Blick wirkt es auf mich so, als sei dieser Teil des Spiels noch nicht wirklich "fertig". Schade denn die enthaltenen Ideen haben durchaus Potenzial. Vor diesem Hintergrund verzichte ich auf eine Wertung für dieses Spiel.

The sun mechanism is truly nifty. I love that the buildings present, the order of the ships, and the position of the sun all impact your decision of where to move and what to do. But all this cleverness is to race up tracks and build buildings, which may not be interesting enough to support the game.

This area control game plays swiftly but can have a few brutal aspects: if you run out of meeples you can wait a loooooong time for your move (I waited 12 turns!) when you are forced to take a lower ranked shipping space. So you need to play carefully.
The board is far too small for the crowded components but it is functional.
Happy to give this another outing.
After a second play, I'm starting to like this game. 
The scoring mechanism is harsh as only the player in first place gets any worthwhile VPs as all other placed players just boost the leading players score and receive few VPs as a result.
The crowded board and iconography are still causing confusion though.

Michael Schact scoring at its most complex.  And unfortunately there's a clear required strategy for the opening moves of this game that, if you're locked out of them, you're hosed for the rest of the game.

So Antarctica is a game I would like to enjoy more than I actually enjoy.  At least until I find a way to crack that code.  And given the current state of gsming (one-and-done), that's not going to happen.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.45
It's a highly tactical euro game where the theme fades completely out after the first turn. The turn order is the mechanism that stands out. It's a bright idea loosely inspired in [thing=66362]Glen More[/thing] that also works as action selection and will determine most of the endgame scoring. It's the soul of the game and its most original feature.

The game is already quite interactive, but the brutal majority scoring system makes it even more competitive. The difference between being first and being second is HUGE.

There's one thing that people needs to bear in mind: This is a tactic game, you can't really play long term. You have to take things as they come and make the best out of your current situation, with just a few global guidelines. If you try to plan everything ahead, there will be AP and downtime.

I think this one of those games where you first game will be plagued with mistakes. You need a second game to see how the game really plays out. Gamers usually don't have enough patience, I guess Antarctica won't gather much love.

An excellent "rondel" game. The board starts off with sparse action spaces - players add more and more as the game progresses. Final scoring is dominated by an area majority mechanism, although there are four important development paths as well - scoring for these can be quite tactical. Coponents are pretty good, but the game [i]could[/i] be bling-ed with even nicer bits.

In plus for this game: it has a very innovative game mechanism with the sun. If it's you first game, you'll need a couple of turns to figure bout how you can manipulate this. In minus: I like majorities, but not super-majorities: here the first player gets tons of points and the rest just get peanuts, which makes a huge difference being first or second. And as there is a certain luck involved (as every type of building can only be once in each area, you need some luck popping - up an unbuilt one when it is your turn.

This is a really interesting game where the whole board is a giant roundel. Each turn the sun marker moves one space, and the player who has their boat first in line of up to three boats, moves it to an open space anywhere on the roundel and then resolves an action in that space. 

The most common action is to build a building, which allows the player to place a meeple in the area for endgame majority scoring. The value of each region increases for each thing in that region. The effects of buildings also get amplified for you depending on how many of your own guys are in the region.

One of the hurdles people have with this game is the downtime. If you place your boats into regions third in line, you might have to wait awhile a few cycles of the sun before you get a turn again. Often times players will also line up their boats in such a way as to get multiple turns in a row. This doesn't bother me, because it's a strategy decision to take actions in those crowded zones.

The other hurdle people have with this game is the scoring. When you do majority scoring, the players with the most meeples in a region get one point for every meeple and building in the area plus one. Players in second place only get points equal to the number of meeples the highest scoring player has in the region. This means first place might have three guys, second place has two, and there are five buildings in the area. In this case, first player would score 11, and second place would only score 3. Every game, no matter how much I emphasize this in the rules explanation, it results in hurt feelings. The intense frustration that they feel over not being able for whatever reason to get a third meeple into that region, they are giving another player 4 points for all of their work, and getting very little benefit for themselves.

I admit this kind of scoring feels wonky. I liked the process of the game enough that I forgave it for 2 plays. On my third, and for the third time, having my group just feel frustration with the game, I have decided that I can't champion it anymore.

A neat little game with an interesting turn order mechanic, and El Grande-like scoring.  I think its slightly under-appreciated.

RATING: 8.1
This has the most unique scoring system.  All points are awarded at the end and it is completely interactive with your opponents.  Kind of a winner takes a lot system unless you are a very savvy player.  The game mechanics are actually very simple: the sun moves to the next sector, the boat that is there moves to a new sector and that player gets to take an action.  The scoring system is what makes this game difficult to wrap your brain around and it may take a few plays to get it.  Good unique thinking euro type game that is aesthetically pleasing to the eye especially when you think of the Antarctica theme and how drab it could be.  It a winner for me.  That is 2 for 2 with argentum verlag games (el gaucho the other) getting more intrigued by this company.

Intrigued after one play. A funky rondel with SUPER Michael Schact style scoring.

This is the best instance I can think of that illustrates an example of a pasted-on theme getting in the way of the game. I have no problem with pasted-on themes. The idea is hopefully that they help players to better understand the game in some way. Short of that, the hope is that at least the theme provides a pleasant artistic diversion, and doesn't get in the way.

Antarctica is a pretty straight-forward abstract game, plus some power cards to add some (unnecessary) Depth. It is a rondel mechanic for turn order. And a Michael-Schacht-Web-of-Power area control scoring mechanic. Fine. I like Web of Power.

Had the game just embraced its abstractness, it would probably rate a [bgcolor=#CC99FF][s][color=#CC99FF]-[/color][/s][b]5[/b][s][color=#CC99FF]-[/color][/s][/bgcolor] or [bgcolor=#9999FF][s][color=#9999FF]-[/color][/s][b]6[/b][s][color=#9999FF]-[/color][/s][/bgcolor] on my very tough scale. The combination of the two mechanisms is somewhat interesting, and hey, these days, slapping only two mechanics together rather than half-a-dozen is probably a Triumph of Design in my book.

But the Antarctica theme really gets in the way. There are fiddly bits all over the cluttered board, and they are needlessly difficult to distinguish. Colors and shapes would have been better. Too simple/boring? Maybe. Fine, but something a bit more focused and intuitive needed to be found.

I like Chevallier, and I think he is on the right track with his ideas of what a good game should involve. Antarctica is just a miss. I'm still eager to try his next effort.

Fun and enjoyable game.  Not strong on theme.  Some interesting mechanics and funny scoring mechanism.

Somehow this game did not click with me or the entire group.  The concept is clever.  The worker placement element is clever.  The board looks cool with all of buildings.  But the actual game play felt boring.  Move some cubes up a track.  Take one more worker here.  Build a building here which does nothing for you beyond some end-game scoring.  It felt very bland and uninteresting.

Love the theme and the look of the game, but just could not get it to the table. Heard mixed review about this one -- especially about how the end scoring works.

Has some cool components, but the gameplay is not that fun.  Theme and mechanics are not tied together well.  Rondel mechanics for moving ships is the best thing about it.

The worst rule book in the history of mankind. A confusing soulless mess. I'm just hoping I got the rules massively wrong. I'll try it again after some video reviews/instructionals. Very disappointed.

Unusual style of game, where making a move both takes actions and provides resources. Would like to play this again, but not sure I'd play it enough to be worth buying it.

This is a very good game. The gameplay is rather different from your average board game and the components are super cool! My only issue with this game is that it is best played with four players. The strategy and competition is at its best with the full complement of players. I do not see myself playing this game with less than four people.

tl;dr: fine but a bit too long

This is a medium weight euro like there are so many on the market. The rules are quite streamlined, it is well produced, it remixes mostly stuff we've seen many times before. So in that regard this game doesn't stand out at all. The theme is slightly original but also unimportant. The artwork is attractive.
So everything is very average (but on this scale, average is good). So the only way to stand out is by doing what the others do but better. Unfortunately that is not the case. It does everything perfectly average. Except that the game goes on for slightly too long.
So yeah, not bad, but it doesn't stand out and there are better alternatives. Man, we are so spoilt with excellent games!

Initial rating: 6.4/10
BGG scale: 6/10

Antartica is a clever game. And surprisingly easy to explain once you have grasped the scoring system.

And the scoring system is brilliantly clever; everything (the board, the research tracks and the discarded resources) are all area majority games. In each case, the winner scores a point for everything in the region (minus ships and the sun). The person in second scores a point for every person the winner used to win and so on down. (Plus 1 point for the winner of each majority)

The game is very clever, though I preferred playing three rather than with four and it is possible both for very clever play and allowing players to do very well by leaving enormous gaps on the board, giving a player a chance to rack up multiple turns. It holds together exceptionally well, but can be incredibly AP prone, as many rondel type games can.

Rating based on two plays:
Like so many others I was dazzled by the theme and cool components on this one. However, the theme is nonexistant - not a problem per se, but why so many different buildings? Why are some made of cardboard? Most buildings don't do anything.

I will probably give it another shot, but so far I am somewhat underwhelmed.

Nice Mechanisms, but way to crowded board in my opinion. A lot of time is used for players of understanding the mess all the nice cardboard and wooden pieces unfortunately make.

Probably the most boring game I played in Essen 2015. Soulless accumulation of Euro mechanisms, theme pasted over by force.

Rating after one play at Essen. Some interesting and quite unique mechanics. Scoring is different from other games: It is very important to understand when to attack a majority and when it is better to let go. I guess it would take quite some time to get used to all the new things and play the game well.

I found this more intriguing than fun. The Sun mechanism to determine turn order (along with deciding where to move your ships both for where you want to do an action and how long you want to wait for your turn again) is really nifty, and the China/Han-esque scoring is fun.

However, I question how different this game will be from play to play. Also only played with 2p, so it might be more dynamic with more. Sadly only played it once before trading away.

Want – for research purposes only, of course. The board kind of resembles [gameid=31075], in layout.. a hugely underrated game, IMHO. Waiting (looks amazing).

Based on one play. Might change my idea. It was so bored. The game was dragging us to somewhere I don't know. Feel like I was not playing the game, but the game was playing us. Hope we play in a wrong rule.

Provisional rating, one incomplete play at Spiel. The Sun/turn order mechanism was interesting, the rest of the game wasn't. But I am no fan of thinky Euros.

A bit byzantine and perhaps there's one too many scoring categories, but there's some cool ideas here. I enjoyed giving this a handful of plays and would return to it if asked.

畫面漂亮是個優點。但可惜的，有時候的行動導致過很久才輪的到你行動，雖說是策略錯誤造成。但那感覺是不好的，朋友們都不喜歡這種被晾在一旁看別人爽爽做很多事才輪到你的感覺。

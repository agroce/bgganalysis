One of the best games I've played lately. 
I loved the theme and the flow of the game, it really felt like I was in a revenge movie, hatching my plans and getting ready to fight. The art is also super cool and extraordinary, makes up stories in your head about the heros and the gangs, and the miniatures make the game more alive. What I liked most about it though is that there were a lot of meaningful choices before and during the fighting. First choosing to go after the right boss, and then weighing whether to retreat and come back stronger when things get rough. It was a challenge to try to find the best way to kill the big boss without getting a lot of damage. Very nice trade-off between chance and puzzle solving. There are a lot of strategies to win which makes me excited to play again. 
I totally recommend this game!

Picked up an advance copy at Gen Con.  Although mechanically it is a fairly straightforward dice puzzle game, it does a surprisingly good job at representing its theme.  Being a fan of revenge movies can take your enjoyment of the game up another notch.

Did my first play and I already love the game, the mecanics are really easy to learn with lots of combos possible. I also love the drafting part with the vengeance cards in the Wronging phase, it adds another layer of strategy to decide who you're gonna attack in the combat phase. The components are of great quality, many (and when I say many I mean a lot) of the minis were bent (first time that I see a Katana making an almost perfect 90 degrees) but easily fixed with boiling water. All in all, this is a really great game and it delivers what it says, it's exciting to go in a den and kill 10 people and a boss with only 2 health of damage just like in the movies

Played at Essen 2017. OMG, It has been a long time since I have encountered something so completely senseless. The story behind the game doesn't make any sense at all and the gameplay is so completely random and boring. You spend the most of the game watching other players roll dice and hack some enemies. While they do that you can easily go grocery shopping. 
And in the end it doesn't even matter if you roll well or badly. In our group the player who rolled ridiculously good managed to clear all enemies from a whole gang, while I rolled utter crap, so I just walked past all the gang members  to the boss and killed him (yeah right, let's leave this guy with his katanas who we tortured just some hours earlier and let him walk to our boss...) Of course this got me more points because my boss was more difficult and spawned more gang members. What??? This game is randomness combined with randomness and some luck on top.
Material is nice though, so I give it a 2

Fantastic release that delicately balances pacing between breather montage phases where you gain abilities and heal, and fast paced fight rounds where you head into map-based combat to take down bosses. 

The disparate pieces of the design come together expertly and offer a very satisfying experience. It feels extremely well developed and smooth.

A well-designed, fast-moving game with a delicious satisfaction from taking the bad guys down. Still on the edge enough to make decisions meaningful, but generously gratuitous in the portrayal of results.

I really enjoyed the "cool factor" of the game most of all; the fact that it feels like an actual fight sequence, despite the turn based system with a timer is quite an accomplishment, and I felt like I had to take decisions on the fly. The cool factor is both something I don't think I've come across in a board game before and also the thing I enjoyed the most.

Would definitely recommend giving this game a go.

Yep - LOTS of FAKE reviews on here, some are the same accounts who also rated Post-Human, the designers other game 9 or 10, which has many 6 ratings due to lack of play-testing, something they "apparently" tried to correct here.  Fake reviews are a HUGE OBVIOUS RED FLAG, and disturbing behaviour, I and many others will run the other way every-time. 

BGG are MORONS (sorry but it's just very frustrating, esp when it could be easily mostly quelled with a strict warning pop-up when someone rates games) for allowing this kind of activity for so many years already, and for games to be rated like this in the first place (Yes, I did it too lol, this is the point, why even allow it), will they ever learn, doesn't seem like it.  Why they continue to allow people to rate games they have not played is really dumb (and not registering a rating for the overall game has predictably done NOTHING to alleviate this)

RATING: 10
I love the cinematic action in the game, makes you feel like a character in a Tarantino movie or a Frank Miller comic. The adrenaline kicks in with the first roll of dice.

The game is unique in the level of pre-planning required from the player, since it's a competitive game, one has to plan how to act to maximise points and possibly even hinder the other players without actively acting on them. Requires a different type of strategic thinking.

There are few games that recreate the Vengeance movie theme and this one has theme at every corner.  The feeling of being able to cut through grunts like butter, and then healing and improving your character all add to the immersion of it all.  It also has a great pace to it, as it slows during the montage phase and accelerates into the combat phase and then back again.  Some of the component quality is not the greatest but all in all, it is a great game.

Really fun game that is something very different than what i was expecting... 
thought i was buying gang zombicide... got sympathy for mr vengence the game! 
it plays more like a fast passed puzzler than an out and out miniature game, but the addition of the board and figures, really add to the aesthetics of the game.
would very much recommend!

Theme looks amazing. Love the minis. The game play seems great. The wronging is such an interesting way to start the game/add flavor with mechanics. I'm going to love this. Die rolls are interesting to put in this. I'm guessing it'll be a 7 or 8 for me.

So far I’ve only played one solo game but I’m sold. The way you have to hurt yourself to possibly improve your scoring adds a lot of tension and the sand timer during fight sequences makes the game extremely intense. The theme works well and is anything but pasted on... the more a boss hurts you the more they are worth when you get revenge!

I knew I would like the combat but I was surprised to discover how much I liked the other phases. My only problem with the game is that it was missing some components and that the initial learning curve is high.  Once you play once there’s no need to return to the rulebook but I’m kind of dreading the process of teaching this to my group.

Until I’ve played more I can’t judge the replay value but at this point I’m very excited to play again. One thing that usually keeps me from replaying games is long setup time... the box insert in this game is great and helps speed up the setup

Update:
I consider this a 9-10 for solo and a 7-8 for multiplayer. The game flows perfectly in solo mode but doesn’t when you have multiple players. I plan to play this exclusively solo.

I was between a 6 and a 7 on this one, but am going with 6 because at this point the amount of setup for the amount of game doesn't match up for me. Because of the overhead, I don't see this as a game I will always be up for. However, it was still pretty fun and I love a game with good story/theme, so this will definitely be making it on to my game table. Hopefully, my feelings on this will improve as I get more familiar with the game.

"In montage turns, players heal and upgrade their heroes through new abilities and items. They also go out scouting gang dens to find the bosses who wronged them and take revenge on them in the fight turn."

"The fight turn is the heart of the game... Fights are basically dice-based puzzles. In each round of the fight, players roll a set of dice and decide the order in which they play the rolled results. "

Vengeance is a popcorn movie with the gas held down by a brick; a lever pushed to ‘awesome’ and broken off in the socket – but that’s all it is. One of the most fun and immersive gaming experiences I’ve had in years.

There are some real laughs to be had with Vengeance, especially during the first few plays. As always, I'm a big fan of dice games, and the setting is wonderfully realized. But the experience is ultimately frustrated by a lack of meaningful player interaction, some finicky and unnecessary rules, and a general sense of repetitiveness. I'm not disappointed I played it, but like a chain-smoking gun-thug it won't be hanging around for long.

Don't get me wrong: the components of this game are very good. But the gameplay is not very exciting.
First, there's minimal player interaction. Basically it's each player for himself against the game. Apart from dice drafting and maybe hiring a Saboteur (if you have the expansion) to hinder other players you have little influence over other players.
Second, the fights against the gangs are extremly easy. You cut through the opposition like a hot knife through butter. As this is a scoring game things depend entirely upon card managment and quite a bit of luck. If you have more then one copy of a boss you are fighting you score additional points. That's the key to victory because winning fights you can take almost always for granted.
To build an entire quite complicated game system around this gaming principle seems like overkill to me.

Ameritrash dice roller enacting a payback action movie. Kitchen sink of game systems.  Card draft for how many gang bosses need to feel your revenge.  Variable player boards, dudes on modular gang location tiles, action dice draft, skill and combat dice checks.  Buff up characters during the montage scenes to upgrade skills, get one use items.  Programmed action cards with the action dice is a fun mechanic.  Interesting idea to have different color cubes represent wound severity on character status.

This looks like a perfect fit for me. I love games with miniatures, and the theme here is so well integrated, it captures the feel of revenge films quite elegantly. I am also a fan of the dice puzzles, and how you spend Montage turns trying to mitigate future bad luck.

The game plays well, but after four quick plays it feels a tad too easy to beat, but that should improve with the Saboteurs expansion added in, and opponents to mess with you.

I like this, but I think more as a family game than a filler for my games group.  There can be a bit of AP in the Carcassonne-like play, but I really like the hidden identity bit, which is perhaps reminiscent of Clans.

I suspect this one will get lots of plays without ever becoming one of my favourites, but I am glad that I have a copy.

Jury is still out on this one with 2 players. Becomes easy to see who will win since only the largest completed field is counted, so makes turns near end of the game useless for the person that is behind.

RATING: 8
A very strategic game for one that has such simple rules! A young child (my seven year old niece, for example) can catch on to it quickly, while the older strategists (myself and her 18 year old brother) can nit-pick at tactics, while ignoring what the 7 year old is doing: she won, by the way! The art is fantastic, and, like everyone else has said, the only real drawback is in the double-sided tiles.

Fun and light, but the two-player games seem to hinge on who's lucky enough to draw the most wolves and hunters.  Perhaps that will be less so with more players. Perfect length, though.

06+ or 07+, 2-4 players, 30 mins. For sharing. With V May 2012. Played July 2012, 3 player. Lovely components, interesting idea but frustrating to play because of the double-sided tiles. We just couldn't play quickly - too may options, and hard - esp for children - to hold tiles in one hand and check both sides before playing. We were so slow that we all gave up playing! Need to try again and to work out a better way to manage the tiles. Saw some homemade holders made of Lego but not sure whether they would work.

I really wanted to like this one. The theme is very nice, the artwork is even nicer, and the fact that you have a hand of tiles, instead of the "draw and play" mechanic of Carcassonne, pointed towards a much more strategic experience.

In the end, though, the many double-sided tiles you have in your hand only add up considerable downtime. I'm usually the guy who plays fast, and if I screw up, then so be it. But not even I could do so here... the choices seemed overwhelming at times.

Add this to the fact that if you don't get enough of your own color tiles soon enough you can get locked down easily by the other players, and you get a very frustrating experience. I might play again. I might even enjoy it better next time, and thus the rating might go up. Eventually. For now, it gets a solid 4, sadly.

I needed a game for very young children and non-gamers. I was interested in Carcassonne in the store but opted for this instead because of the cute sheep and colorful graphics... Has never really grabbed me (I have yet to play it aggressively) but I'll play if I'm asked to. The game tries to punish greedy players, but the trick is to know when enough is enough. Also I don't see how players can keep their color secret for long, it becomes so obvious through the first rounds. The children love it and sometimes also use it as a tile-puzzle.

Seems to be a Carcassone variant aimed at the family. The only downer is that I found it difficult to keep track of all my tiles. Since they are double sided and rotation is important there is a lot to keep track of. If you are taking it seriously, of course...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
There are some good ideas in this game: the secret identities make the beginning turns interesting as you try to figure out who is whom and bluff about your own color. I also like that unlike Carcasssonne you have a hand of tiles to choose from, which gives you more options for strategic placement (especially with your bonus actions when you reveal your color). On the other hand, the double-sided tiles are annoying to dig through, and make turns last way too long as everyone searches to find a good tile. Halfway through the game I was already bored.

I wanted to love this game, but it was a big “meh” (or perhaps “bah”?) for me. I love games with spatial elements such as Taluva and Carcassonne etc., and while I did enjoy to place the pieces, the game really didn’t work!

First of all, the hidden color is a very good and clever idea in theory, but in practice it doesn’t work as you quickly find out who is who. Second, it’s a lot of fun to place the tiles in Carcassonne, but in this one there are a lot of impossible designs (like a forest on the other side of a city), so it is impossible to place tiles if your opponents know this and try to obstruct your gameplan – which they should. Often you can’t complete your own pasture because of this (at least if you want your pasture to be somewhat big so you have a chance of winning), so you need to be very lucky by drawing the right tiles… And often this tile simply doesn’t exist, despite the doublesided tiles (which was a good thing). What wasn’t a good thing was that you need to hold all of your tiles in your fist, which is impossible, especially as you get more and more tiles throughout the game and because you need to flip the tiles… Not handy! Yet an issue with the game is the hunter and wolf tiles! If you are lucky to draw some wolves and hunters you have a huge advantage as other people don’t have the option to threat (or protect) your pastures bordering a forest… And even if you don’t want to use them as hunters/wolves, these tiles have 4 animals on the back which can be very handy.

Finally, I think that the 6 points you get if you are the first to pass can be a big deal as 6 points is quite a lot in this game. Of course, on the other hand you cannot influence the game from then on, but you are probably just going to say it once you realize you cannot get a bigger pasture (oh, and in my play two os us passed almost simultaneously, but the player who said it 0.1 second faster got three points more – not cool). I did try the 2p-variant and I don’t think it was better or worse.

Fun tile laying game where you try to make the largest single sheep enclosure in your color. You can place wolf tiles in the forest to neutralize the scoring of any sheep enclosure bordered by a forest which you place your wolf in. Hunter tiles protect the sheep from Wolf tiles by covering the wolf tile or being placed in the forest ahead of the wolf.

Nice intro to tile-laying games that the kids enjoy.  We usually play without the wolves since the kids don't like that threat if their sheep are near a forest.  As they get older, we'll add that factor into the game.  Our 4 y.o. can play with just a little help and our 7 y.o. can play well.  The kids also like to play scoring ALL the completed fields (not just the largest).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Wooly Bully is related to Carcassonne only in that they are both tile laying games. The strength of the game is no one knows who wants which color sheep to be enclosed.  Because of that, I suspect that the best way to play is with 3 players, or two players, each controlling only one color sheep.  That way there is still a wonderful, odd, bluffing/misdirection that can be achieved during play - which I feel is the best thing about it.

A fine filler game, or introduction game for non-gamers.

It will remind people of Carcassonne; it's inevitable, but to make direct comparisons between the two is a disservice to this neat little thinking game.  While I think the game should have used 5 colors and had a max of 4 players (rather than 4 players, 4 colors), there's strategies here that will force you to break habits from Carcasonne.  My only gripe: the concept of using wolves to negate scoring fields seem a bit strong.  With a clever play, a player can effectively wipe all the other players out of the game with no hope of catching up at all.

Production: Beautiful tiles that form a very attractive network of sheep fields when pieced together.  the tiles have a strange, slick laminate, but are still easy to handle.  I’m not a fan of their being double-sided, as it makes for much tile turning.  Play: In a four-player game the secret colors seem to be non-factors.  It seems one must play offensively, because noone is going to build one’s pasture for them.  thus the wolves and defensive play come as an after-thought.  As such, there isn’t much tension.

This is almost a good game.

Unfortunately, by the end of the game, it is possible to have a dozen or more double-sided tiles in your hand... which is way too many options to analyze.

Also, if one person is lucky enough to get 3 hunters or 3 wolves, he has essentially a veto power over anything anyone else tries to do.

I do love the tile laying mechanic, the basic idea and the artwork, but it's a misfire I'm afraid.

Clever tile-laying game with a cute theme and excellent artwork. Many different strategies are possible. Do you reveal your Shepard early to get extra sheep on the board and lock down a pasture or lay low to keep your opponents guessing? When a large pasture of one color develops does everyone pile on and screw their neighbor or is it a trick? Really fun game for multiple playings for noobies or seasoned gamers alike.

Not that impressed. Too few tiles which leads to clear kingmaking strategies. Perhaps it's better just to save up on your own colour and try to close as many of the opponents pastures as possible until they pass out and then build one huge pasture yourself?

The tiles are very pretty and sturdy.  The gameplay, though, is a little odd...  I have some problems with all the out-of-turn stuff, but they might go away with experience (or be fixable with house rules).  Not really much at all like Carcassonne except very superficially.

Beautiful artwork in a nice small box, but how many tiles can you jam into your hand at once? How many can you flip while holding them in one hand? This game is a bit of fun, but it's awkward to play and could be vastly improved.

Can be as deep as the you and the other players make it.  We liked the sheep / art work, and it didn't feel like we were playing a kids' game -- though it's certainly suitable for that too.
The tiles are thick and glossy, which should help with durability.  We added a larger bag to make drawing tiles easier to do.

Friendly tile laying game with cute sheep theme.  Comparable in some ways to Carcassonne, although in Wooly Bullly all your eggs are in one basket (sheep in one pen), so you can either score highly or lose out to a wolf - to some extent it is about risk management.  It can be frustrating to work hard in building a large field only to lose the game to a forest tile and wolf played by an opponent, so in this respect it is inferior to Carcassonne, which rewards tactical scoring per turn and not just end scoring.  Great components and cute theme, however, and keeping your colour secret can be a great bluffing element.

Nice artwork and design. A good game for two as it is for four. Only drawback is as the tiles start to run out, players have less and less options available - especially once a player cashes in for the bonus points. Can easily get stuck without the correct tile piece for the whole game. But that is a minor criticism for a very good game.

A Carcassone knock-off with some clever hidden player ideas.  Much of the suspense lies in keeping your color secret for as long as possible, especially in a 2-player game.  The village looks really nice once the game is over.

Played twice. I like the theme and the tile-laying ness of the game. Holding a fistfull of tiles without revealing any to an opponent is a bit awkward, but I'm not sure that the secrecy is all that important. I think new players may forget about doing some things out-of-order (adding wolves/hunters, declaring their color, or giving up) which may annoy them. Suppose one person wants to add a wolf and another person wants to add a hunter to the same field at the same time?

Kind of a failure in the tile-placing genre, WB had some good ideas but none of it really worked for me in the end. There were just too many tiles to choose from in your hand with not enough choices for placement. This made for a really frustrating game where every turn was a lot longer than it should be because of the overwhelming spatial puzzle this game created. This might be the top game for fluffy theme vs. mechanics, as I would not expect putting sheep into pens to be this complicated. Overall, the frustration greatly outweighed the fun. Might play again if asked, but I'd groan.

a.k.a. "Wooly Bully"  It looks like a kids game, but trust me, it's fun for adults.  Super as a family game, as you can help other players or hinder them, as you choose.  I introduced this one to an artist and a physicist, and we were all giggling.  I love saying "dee flip, dee floop!" in a Swedish Chef voice as I flip my tiles over looking for the perfect match.  Maybe that's why I don't have a lot of gaming buddies.  :-)

The game is only modestly interesting, and already has one foot in the grave because it feels a lot like a lighter and crappier Carcassonne.  But the real nail in the coffin is the two-sided tiles - one of the most stunningly inept design decisions I've seen in a serious game.  What was the thought here?  "Hmmm . . . we need players to hide their tiles from each other, and we know that their hand size may be enormous by the end of the game . . .  hey, let's make the tiles two-sided!  Brilliant!!!"  No, it's infuriating.

At first, this look like a simplfied Carcassonne clone. However, the hidden information AND the ability to build up a hand of tiles adds enough to the game to really make it stand on its own.

In fact, the fact that you both get a hand of tiles AND you can icnrease the size of that hand makes Wooly Booly a bit more strategic than Carcassonne.

Odd blend of Carcassone-esque tile placement with Drakon-level screwage.  An interesting multiplayer puzzle with just a tinge of mystery as to who is playing which color.  The double-sided tiles add both a nice element of strategy and unpredictability, but also a bit too much randomness if the piece you seek has already been played upside down without your knowledge.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
More novel than good, it seems overdeveloped and somewhat unbalanced. The hand size changes might seem like a good idea, but they don't have any synergy with the two sided tiles: It's hard to know what you are holding with a bunch of tiles in your hand that have two different playable sides! One of the two mechanics should have been gone. I guess that a computer implementation should make this easier to play, but the physical aspect of the game just doesn't work well.

Also, 4 wolves and 4 hunters that show up in every game mean that they'll only come into play in the 4 player game, and even then, more as a chance element than anything else.

I played 2 times. Both games were great, One of those game was a 2 players one and we played 2 colors each but one blind. It was a beat passive, less blocking, a bit of cooperation, more luck, I liked the thrill of knowning which is our second color, it makes a somehow suprise ending. We have the pleasure to realize that YOU have built and over exagerated on a great barn of the wrong color! :) I liked it! I prefered the endplay
of a 2 players game played that way then a regular one with 4 players.

It's so incredibly easy to get your herd of sheep attacked and fiddled with that I don't see why the points for this aren't 4 for each player.  The moment you try and get anything significant going on, the other player moves to stop it with impossible tile areas making your fence incomplete.  you won't catch me playing this again.

On the surface, it's Similar to Carcassonne, but it's different enough to be its own game.
My only gripe with the game, is that you end up (in the late half of the game) sitting with a huge pile of double sided tiles, and endless posibilities to play them this way or that way. This may lead to a very slow finish in tight and/or competitive games. There should be be a maximum handsize.

Great name, cool song, lame game. Kind of like a Carca-zone primer. It differs in that the tiles are double-sided (amounting to a great deal of "fiddly" trying to find ones that match)and there's no Meeples to place. Not really a fan of this genre.

I really wanted to like this game, but attractive components and appealing theme can't overcome clunky gameplay.  The ever-growing hand size of two-sided tiles quickly leads to a downtime problem, as players repeatedly shuffle through 20 or more potential tile plays.  There's just got to be a better game hiding here, with just a few variants or rule tweaks.  I'm clinging to my slim hopes that the upcoming English release (as Wooly Bully) will reveal the problems to be in the translation posted here at BGG.  Yeah, right.

This is my daughter's (4 years) game, that's why the rating is based on her opinion. The game is simply too difficult for her. She doesn't understand the decisions and sometimes even what she is supposed to do... On the other hand, illustrations are nice and the possibility to play with us always turns her on. In order to rate this game more objectively I should play it with adults only. However do not know if that is going to happen any time soon. The game has a lot in common with Carcassonne.

Tai mano dukros (4 metai) žaidimas, todėl įvertinimas atspindi jos nuomonę. Jis jai paprasčiausiai per sunkus. Ji nesupranta sprendimų ir kartais net gi ką turėtų daryti...

RATING: 6
Based on one, three-player game.  Okay game.  Cute but one flaw is the rule that says to draw tiles based on the number of sides matched on your placed tile.  This leads to the accumulation of a huge number of double-sided tiles in your hand which never get used.  This also leads to analysis paralysis as each player searches through their large hand of tiles.  This conflicts with the light nature of the game.  My next play will try a variant that limits players to one bonus placement per turn for matching sides and also limits hand size to three tiles.  My rating assumes this variant will be a success.  Also to consider, scoring all closed pens for each player, not just the largest.

Remek, hangulatos játék nem csak kisebbeknek. Sőt, szerintem a 7 éves alsó korhatár a játékszabályok elsajátításához elég, de a játék átlátásához, és taktikázáshoz biztosan nem. Van benne jó nagy adag szerencse (milyen lapka kerül az ember kezébe), de azért több múlik azon, hogy milyen stratégiát választ az ember, és mennyi kockázatot vállal. A képek karakteresek, a lapkák minősége nem a legjobb, de azért elfogadható. Összességében kiváló játék!

A tile laying game like Carcassonne but you accumulate a hand of two sided tiles, so there are a lot more options in choosing what tiles you want to play. This makes the game more strategic but it also slows down play as you have to keep reviewing your tiles to decide which ones to play, many of which have the wrong colour sheep and are not that useful anyway. Overall, a bit disappointing. The tiles are beautifully done, however, so maybe this is a game awaiting a better set of rules.

In particular, it would be great to have a way to trade tiles that have the wrong colour sheep with other players, or maybe a meeple-like system of claiming any fenced in area regardless of sheep colour.

RATING: N/A
It can be hard to keep track of all the tiles you hold, since they feel a little less differentiated than the Carcassonne tiles, for example.  It's hard to keep track of the color orderings of the different sheep, especially with different configurations on either side of each tile.  The game could also use screens for the double-sided tiles.  This is definitely a pretty tactical game, but there are choices regarding play style (e.g., getting a larger hand, minimizing enemy pens, making large pens hard to finish, etc.).

Tom gives it a favorable/fun rating.

Seems like it would be a great entree game for preparing younger kids for carcassonne. BUT may be a tad too deep for young ones being that there is a strategy element. Then again another review of Tom's review and it seems that this is worth getting.

Seems carcassonnish.

Eric Summner rates very high as a couple game.

Nice looking game, and one that my kids liked a lot.

It's too random though, the wolf/hunter-thing doesn't work and it's quite arbitrary, who has the largest field in the end.

We changed the rules to count the total of all enclosed sheep, having the largest field as tiebreaker, and that seemed more fair.

For me, this game fits somewhere between Carcassonne and El Caballero.  There is more potential for strategy than in Carcassonne, but it requires much brain-drain than El Cabellero.  Games generally go quickly, but I can see it really bogging down with certain types of people.  The double-sided tiles, although a cool concept, are a bit of a pain in the ass in practice.  It takes a bit of getting used to.

Holy adorable french sheep Batman! Interesting little tile-laying game. Neat bluffing mechanic that reminds me of Colovini's clans. You have to be careful not to give away what color it is you are working on while still being able to score enough points. Also some danger inherent with the wolf mechanic. Pretty colorful artwork, and a nice small little game to take along with you.

Bought on a hunch, trying to ride Carcassonne's success in the family. Tile-layer + high cuteness factor + really nice graphics, it has to be a smasher, right? Kinda, in the sense of absolutely not. It has nothing to do with Carc and despite the looks it's definitely a game for adults, at least if you plan a strategic play. It's OK with smaller children just to playing with the tiles and colors, but playing it proper cutthroat style- I don't think so.

Simpler version of carcassone. I hate the fact that the tiles are double-sided. Having a hidden colour is only really a factor in the first 2-3 rounds. Would have liked more hunter/wolf tiles. Gameplay very bland.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very tentative rating. There's enough to make this distinctive among tile-layers: the hidden identity, having a hand of tiles to choose from rather than draw one - play one, and an interesting tile mix including double-sided tiles (except for one??) for more agonizing choices. All of which contribute to a game with a higher screwage factor than expected, at the (perfectly acceptable) cost of a somewhat less aesthetically pleasing map (lots of holes). It is fairly easy to prevent a field from ever being closed. Now why my daughter is perfectly comfortable doing this but can't accept my blocking her routes in Ticket to Ride is beyond me. 

Overall, I'm appreciative of the twists. A kinda creepy tiebreaker/bonus point rule makes the game less satisfying. And, I'm concerned that there might be too much of an incentive to spend the first 3/4 of the game just building up a big hand. Would try it with three or four, but because of the direct conflict I think it would be best with two.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
Am I missing something? While the comparisons to Carcassonne are unsurprising, I am shocked by the number of people who believe Wooly Bully is the more strategic game. I believe this is an incorrect conclusion drawn from the fact that in this game you play from a hand full of tiles rather than the single tile drawn in Carc. In reality, however, this is offset by the fact that so few of the tiles in your hand are actually playable due to the far more limiting placement restrictions (standard Carc tiles only have three different sides and the distribution is rather forgiving, as opposed to the 6+ sides and unforgiving distribution of WB). This, combined with the meeple laying and potential stealing factor, makes the decisions in Carc much more meaningful. WB encourages building large regions, as opposed to many smaller regions, then makes it incredibly easy for them to be decimated with a single wolf play. The color mystery factor is rather muted. Wooly Bully is a very unsatisfying game.

A bit clunky. Holding dozen two-sided tiles in your hand, keeping them secret and available is not easy.

It's kind of neat: the game is quite mean and brutal, it's easy to make fields impossible to complete. So - should I keep the fields small and lose points, or grow them larger and risk sabotage? That's nice.

Pros and cons, but overall I find the game a bit clunky.

Does anyone have a better translation than the one available here? Maybe it's the actual rules, not the translation, that's the problem. We played with two players, each having two colors and found the game rather tedious. I see a good game lurking in here with a different set of scoring rules. One idea that occurred - multiply the number of sheep in an enclosure by the number of tiles. I'm thinking the game might be more enjoyable with 3 or 4 players, but I see many think it's best with two. Double-sided tiles are really annoying, as well. This is a game that I really want to like (Carc: H&G being one of my favorites) so I'll give it some more opportunities to win me over, but the first playing was rather disappointing.

First impression (3 player): This is one of those "guess which color/pieces I'm playing" like Clans. Usually I don't like them too much but here it works off well. The gameplay is a cross between Carcassonne and Gardens of Alhambra. Your aim is to create as big complete pasture of sheeps of your color as it is possible. The problem is that other players try to prevent it and there is also a way to nullify pasture if there is a forest next to it. 

The trick is that only the biggest pasture is counted so it doesn't matter if you close off other players pastures (while they are small). The other nice mechanic is that game ends when every player has decided to end playing. Naturally you get bonus for going out early (6-3-1 bonus points, where esp. 6 can be a lot sometimes). There is a nice gamble between getting off early (but letting other players to play remaining pieces in bag / in their hands.

Worthwile mentioning is the fact that players hand size can grow (from initial 4) to a bigger if they play tiles well. You draw one tile for each side of tile that connects to already built structure. Only bad thing in this is that tiles are doublesided and in case of 6-8 tiles it tends to be quite a lot of flipping them trying to go through your options. Probably bad idea to play with AP prone players who have hard time visualizing tiles to table...

The game works probably best with 3 players because then there is one neutral color (which still isn't known in the beginning). It isn't as much of a building game like Carcassonne as it is bluffing and risk taking. Only your biggest area matters and going out early(ish) is very tempting but might backfire badly.

A very simple tile game with hidden player colors. Cute artwork and high quality components.

The tiles are two-sided, which makes hand management very difficult: You have to keep your tiles hidden and keep turning them around in your hand. With two or three tiles this might still be tolerable but since you get more and more tiles all the time, you'll soon end up with at least a dozen tiles, which is a complete mess.

Seems broken, clearly not worth trying with adults. Probably works for children. Absolutely pointless with two players.

Carcassonne + secret colour assignation + cute sheep = fun!

Nowhere near as obvious as you'd think, this is a game that rewards planning and knowing the spread of tiles; hence it is much more strategy-oriented than Carcassonne. One small rule tweak makes it an interesting decision on when to hold onto wolves and hunters. Required my Lego skillz to make suitable tile holders, too.

I'm not convinced about the value of having hidden player colours with four, though...

Hand size seems to get out of hand quickly, which gives tons of tile flexibility but is unwieldy. I can't imagine a child managing that many tiles, especially given that you're supposed to keep them hidden. Wolves don't seem very useful, as hunters can just be held onto until the end.

I think it might be fair to characterize this game as Carcassonne with training wheels.  Perhaps that's why I prefer Wooly Bully--it's more my speed!  Seriously, though, the quality of this game is first rate.  The tiles are hefty, with a very nice finish, and their artwork is charming.  The fact that the tiles are double-sided complicates things a bit, but since your opponents are in the same boat, there's usually plenty of time to frantically review your options before your next turn comes around.  I never win at Wooly Bully, training wheels notwithstanding, but I enjoy it anyway.   (4+3)

Easter Egg sheep! Is this the predecessor to Carcassonne? A very nice Carcassonne style game! The mechanic of holding the tiles in your hand is a little awkward, but still nice to have a selection of tiles to choose from each turn. Connecting tiles in ways that allow you to get more tiles for your hand is nice too! I never tire of the seemingly endless variety of ways to play tile placing games! I don't know why, it's just fun!

One of my first boardgames without dice and different than memo, I know it was designed for young players, but it is quite nice, and if you play it well with good opponents it may be really good game, as it becomes an expand'n'block game. It is somehow similar to Carcassone, but much simpler. I think that someone should design an expansion (maybe I'd try?), so it'd become a very interesting game.

A Carcassonne wannabe. The downside is that the tiles have features on both sides and you have a collection to choose between, which means you're forever flipping tiles around to determine best play. Which spells downtime trouble, and with the play and scoring being otherwise fairly straight-forward, there isn't a saving grace from being average.

This tile laying game is a bit of a brain burner. While Carcassonne concentrates on the immediate option and the points in the long run, Wooly Bully seems to make the decision more complex, partially because you have more tiles in your hand, and thus a lot more options. Another thing that is mildly annoying is counting the sheep at the end. I got to play this one more and reevaluate the points.

I like the fact that you can choose to keep the color of your sheep a secret.  Also, the cute factor of this game sends it right over the edge...the tiles are sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo cute :)  The gameplay is fun too.  My only complaint is that you are supposed to keep your tiles secret in your hand, so it gets kinda hard to look at everything when you have a lot of tiles.  Not a major problem though, in my opinion.

Cute tile laying game I wanted to try out. Really luck dependent if you get the right tiles at the right time. I can't say I was that impressed with the turn out. By the end I was ready for the end. cute family game and intro into Carc but I would just much rather play Carcassonne instead. I didn't find I was making any clever moves or anything. Not impressed.

Shepherding crossed with Carcassonne.  Colour-coordination of fields while trying to keep the wolves out of your sheep pens or at least set hunters out to get them.  Players secretly are protecting a particular field colour while tile laying to try to maximise the number of sheep in their fields.  Interesting but slightly too much of a brain-burner trying to figure out how best to place tiles as it's more complex than Carcassonne, but would suit those who think that's too light.

okay tile laying game that I think might play best with four.  Has a cat-and-mouse feel to it as you feel out your opponent's color.  there are interesting tactical decisions that are important pertaining to playing wolves, hunter and your shepherd tile.    I wish there are some other way to go through all your tiles.  Fumbling through them so your opponents don't see it very difficult.  Overall, there isn't much meat to this game but it's short enough to be fun from time to time.

Carcassone, véleményem szerint gyengébb megoldásokkal. A játék számomra egyetlen erénye a szépsége, aranyosak a bárányok, az egész épülő terület jól néz ki és jó minőségűek a kártyák a magyar kiadásban. Titokban mindenki a saját bárányai mennyiségét próbálja a lapkákkal növelni és végén erdővel és kerítésekkel bekeríteni. A jó pillanatban kell felfedni melyik színnel vagyunk és jól kell megválasztani a vadász és farkas lapkák lehelyezését. A magyar szabály sajnos rendkívül rosszul sikerült, sok félreértelmezhető pont van benne. Nem tetszik a játékban a lapkák lehelyezésének akár sorrenden kívüli volta egyes lapok esetében. Nem tetszett.

Decent little tile laying game.  I like it much more than Carcassonne due to the amount of options that are given.  Neat secret identity, that gives a bonus when revealed.  Important to know when to bow out.  Beware the player that decides to come in second, this problem breaks many games, but abosultely ruins this one.  While this game is fine as a whole, there is nothing really compelling to bring it back onto the table.

Obviously very similar to Carcassonne, but the wolf and hunter tiles, the early out rules, and the hiding of your sheep's colour (a nice bit of bluffing accessible to younger players -- my 6 year old has no difficulty with this) make it an entertaining play on its own merits.  Some of the tiles require a deliberate choice, too, between greed (loads of sheep on one side) and strategic action (wolf/hunter on the other.)  Lots of family fun.

Game premise along the lines of Munchkin.  Winner is the one who flies under the radar the longest.  2 player game is less than fun, as you can't stop your opponent, you can only slow them down.  Not enjoyable game. The concept of having the farm with the most sheep wins really confuses me.  There's little strategy when you can play 3 tiles in a row.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
A Carcassonne-esque tile game that suffers in comparison. There are fewer tiles (and tile types), and thus far fewer choices for players. The luck element is huge ... one player could draw all the wolves and hunters, virtually assuring victory. The rules are unclear in places, to boot. Extremely disappointing ...

Very nice game.  I like tile laying, so this is a good one for that.  

The components are very nice and the artwork is great.  My only complaint about the components are the double-sided tiles.  It can be difficult to look at what your choices are because you have to keep flipping them.

This is one of those games that I think is underrated. Enough challenge for gamers and enough fun for non-gamers, pretty to look at, scales well from 2-4 and it's inexpensive.  Seems like it would have a place in most people's collection.

Tile placement game. Timing is of the utmost essence in this game and it generally plays smoothly.

RATING: N/A
The country of La Guerre des Moutons (the war of sheep) is full of fields and forests. There are sheep in the fields and wolves and hunters in the forests. Each player tries to make the largest pens with his own sheep inside by placing his own tiles. You can easily close small pens, or you can be ambitious and try to build large farms... but if you cannot enclose the fields, your sheep are likely to be eaten by the big bad wolves roaming in the nearby forests. Each player's animal is secret at the beginning of the game, but the soonest you reveal it, the more points you get. Tile Placement.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The double-sided tiles add some more choices to make in this Carcassonne variant, but it also adds a lot more time to the game.  Additionally, the wolves and hunters seem to be added to force direct interaction between the players, and I prefer a more subtle form of aggression in my games.

Good tile-laying game where you try to enclose the biggest flock of ship.  The gameplay is similar to Carcassonne or Ark of the Covenant.

For whatever reason, this game always half-heartedly called to me, but I've finally played it.  The two-sided tiles provide plenty of options, as well as strange hand-management challenges, as you attempt to maximize a flock in your color.  Covertly.

After 1 Play: Hidden player colors felt pointless, as it quickly becomes obvious who's playing which color.  Double sided tiles are a pain, as you have to keep checking the reverse sides.  Flocks must be completely fenced in to score, but it is way too easy to block their completion. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I really enjoyed my first games, until I realized that the best thing to do is to place the tile that will be adjacent to the most tiles no matter if it doesn't help you. Playing that way, you are sure to draw lots of tiles that will ensure you to have the largest enclosed herd of your color at the end of the game (because you draw as many tiles as there are adjacent tiles to the one you put). When everyone knows the trick, they all try to do the same, i.e. playing in a way to draw as many tiles as possible and the game falls flat. But it is a really entertaining game for kids.

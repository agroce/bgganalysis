RATING: N/A
The static-income mechanic of Insight is fantastic, and far outstrips the insane economy roller coaster of Rise of Vigil and Darkness Unleashed (bleh). Private Dreamscape cards are awesome, and offer really powerful abilities that require careful management to acquire. Even the vanilla cards added are sweet. This is a powerhouse expansion.

For trade in UK Math Trade or BGG Trade.

Components checked.

"Full" standalone game.  (NOT part of a "Block").

Adds "Insight" as another "currency" in the game for buying Dreamscape cards.

All of the sets in Ascension are not particularly deep or strategic.  There is randomness in the way Ascension plays.  But I love the Ascension sets because they're quick to set-up, the  turns are quick, the ease of play, trying new sets mixed together is fun and being able to play cool combo turns when you get some really good cards in your deck is so much fun.

More Ascension on iOS is always fun. This one introduces a new resource called insight and each player has a secret pool of cards that requires insight to play, called your dreamscape. This is separate from your normal deck of cards. These cards have one-shot abilities, constructs and heroes. In the central deck, new cards will generally provide insight and can add additional cards to your dreamscape. 

I vastly prefer this new system to the Rally mechanism in the Dawn of Champions. I also think if I were to play this as a physical set, it would be less fiddly than energy system in the Rise of Vigil block. As in typical Ascension tradition, some cards make you think 'this is ridiculously good!' For example, there is a dreamscape card that only costs 2 insight and is a construct that adds a rune or power to every mystic of heavy infantry played. It's hard to keep tempo when an opponent plays this and then just loads up on Infantry and Mystics.

Overall, this is a pretty decent set. I normally play this with War of Shadows.

I own the App version.  This is one of the best looking Ascension variants out there but also the most swingy.  Some (cheap) cards are very OP and things tend to snowball more than in previous expansions/versions of Ascension.  I still like it, but it is not as good as other sets and it doesn't combine nearly as well with other sets.  The dreamscape/insight generators get too diluted which only makes it more swingy for the person who gets the early insight generators.

I enjoy choosing some Dreamscape cards to start each game. Some are really nice to get going early, and others are worth trying to save up for as quickly as possible. The new Insight resource works well, and I like that they have other uses beyond acquiring your Dreamscape cards.

I have played this game a ton on my tablet. The physical game does live up it. Despite it's randomness and weird art one of the best deck-builders I have played.

I think it is the randomness that makes it so interesting. Also most cards feel unique, so you don't feel like you're buying the same cards over and over.

Unfortunately, the Dream cards are poorly balanced (about 40% are quite weak for their cost), making the pre-game selection less interesting than it ought to be.

I can't see this set working well as a standalone; it really wants to be diluted with other sets so that the slightly dodgy Dream/Rune feature doesn't dominate play.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (September 2016)

Ascension: Dreamscape is one of the best iteration in the series.

The rules remain the same plus the added dreamscape mechanism. If you know the rules the changes can be explained under 2 minutes, if you don’t the whole game can be explained under 9 minutes.

Best with two players.

The art is great. I have always liked Ascension’s art right from the beginning!

In general, I heavily dislike deckbuilding games that feature a variable market offering as this one does. The reason is that the game is mostly about tactics (reaction) than about strategy (planning). In this regard I vastly prefer to play Dominion and its true descendants (Tanto Cuore, Penny Arcade, Nightfall). I really hate when a good card appears on my turn and then it doesn’t on an opponent’s turn, for me, this kind of game is very unfair and luck has a very high influence in the outcome. Having saying that, I’m enjoying my (iPad) plays of Ascension: Dreamscape.

The luck factor has always been high in the game series. Here it remains high but you can choose 3 cards for your dreamscape at the beginning of the game, mitigating it a bit, however from this point onward, every time you draw a dream card, luck alone will decide if the cards is good or not. Due to this, the overall luck factor has increased a bit in this iteration.

Bottom line, Ascension: Dreamscape is one of the best expansion/standalone Ascension game to date, I won’t ever buy it due to its chaotic nature with the variable market offering, but I will continue to play it on the iPad. It has way too much uncontrollable luck for my liking.

Current rating: 5.5

Cards in protectors dont fit in a box. And box contains 75% of air. Worst box in ascension series. You need to store cards outside box. 
So why box is so big? 
Because You need to store Your air.

I've never seen so stupid solution. I understand - if box is small, then cards with protectors can be problem. 
But this box is big enough to store all cards from ascension series in protectors. Even with one or two sets of crystals. But producers preffer air than cards. 
Next expansion will be without cards. Air only. 39,99$ per box.

This expansion keep with the original game mechanics, but adds a dream deck for people to pick cards out of, as well as, the original row.  This is the only expansion that I don't really like all that much. I feel like the dream deck is very limited to what you can pull out of it. The art is still fantastic, and t's still an ascension game. On that note, I would totally still recommend it.

iOS. Not a great game, but I can play it with friends while I'm on the go. This variation adds a new deck and each player has their own market from the new deck, with a new currency to buy from that market. Still the same game though.

The Dreamscape mechanic adds a needed extra layer of strategy to the game, and gives each player a private assortment of cards to mess with. It creates an interesting system on what factions and effects you want to pull off big combos. It plays amazingly by itself and is a beautiful looking game.

It's Ascension (i.e. much better as an app). I don't really enjoy single set play as much as I like mixing them. But of course, this dilutes the card pool, so the unique mechanisms for each set are less utilized.

In conclusion, they should ditch the unique mechanisms per set, or make mechanisms that can carry over and maybe interact between sets.

As far as this set goes, I like the Dreamscape cards, and how they can give you an inkling of a strategy to pursue. Whoever made the tokens footballs needs to be punished.

I enjoy playing this game. The Dreamscape adds a deeper level of strategy, and adds to the possibility of making a comeback from a sticky situation. Very interesting combos and a cool and simple gameplay that still leaves room for deep strategy and adaptive play.

A nice addition and probably one of the more complex releases to date. I'm actually enjoying it the more I've played, but it's not nearly as good as some of the other sets. The dream deck is fiddly and random. It can be extremely swingy depending on the cards that come out.

The egg things are a poor design choice as they're rounded and can roll right off the table. They look cool, but are crazy impractical. Initially I had mixed this in with War of Shadows, but I keep them separate now. Not sure they really blend that well together.

I like this even better than Realms Unraveled. Does take longer, though.

Solo tip: There are definitely more High-Honor-Value cards in this one. With some practice using the Dreamscape, you'll probably be steamrolling the Cult in no time. For added difficulty later on, try giving the cult 3 cards instead of 2. It ramps the whole thing up to pretty insane levels.

Really interesting to have a private set of cards to buy from, but there's a few problems:
1. Yet another currency
2. The currency is egg shaped, so they roll around and we have to use rubber bands to "corral" them
3. Doesn't mix well with any of the other sets

I haven't really kept up with Ascension, so a couple of expansions (stand-alones?) have popped up while I wasn't looking. Fortunately Ron is a fan and has been collecting them. I really enjoy the base game system and usually like seeing what the new twist of each iteration brings to the table.

This version includes "insight" which are crystals you can spend to play insight cards. You start with some insight cards keeping a few and discarding the rest. These can be played during the game once you can afford them. There are also insight cards that appear in the summoning deck (isn't that what it's called, I forget).

There are a lot of low level one-shots that you "buy, play once and banish" in this edition which is a bit interesting. Some of the higher level insight cards look like they could be crazy powerful.

Fortunately I was able to end the game just as Ron was ready to roll out his power cards and crush me. Another turn or two and I wouldn't have had a chance.

This game has the same gameplay excitement I used to get from Magic the Gathering but doesn't have a high (and continual) cost investment and focuses all the time on playing rather than a considerable amount of time just planning for the next play.

Even without the feel of MtG, this game is great as a standalone.  I do find that most deckbuilding games appeal to me but this is the undisputed king in my mind.  Dominion is great, Star Realms is good, Legendary encounter games are ok, LOTR based ones are not bad, but Ascension is the perfect one.

As far as Ascension individual sets go, Dreamscape offers a cool system for giving players a goal or goals before the first hand is even played.  Unlike dawn of champions, that goal is not excessively emphasized or even necessary and doesn't break down the tactics with randomness elements.  It does have one overpowered dream card (Vigils Resolve is epic on its own, gets super overpowered with war of shadows set, and is worth 3 points at a cost of 2 completely unnecessarily).  Still a great solo set and mixes well enough with a single other set.  If you mix more than one other set with it the dilution of the insight resource generation really sort of kills the balance of the dreamdecks and makes certain center cards too much of a priority for their intended power balance.

Insight was a fun alternative resource, as well as your dreamscape being a second "hand", but who thought that faceted egg-shaped tokens would be good to use?! They roll!

Funkenschlag is a 6 player game of low complexity. The object is to supply a number of cities with power (electricity). The cities are evenly distributed on a board, which contains rivers, hills and sea coves. Players build a network of power lines over which power stations supply electricity. The power stations are purchased via an auction, types of power stations; coal, gas, oil, garbage, uranium, nuclear fusion and wind.

Players supply their power stations with resources, which are purchased from a stock market containing raw materials. Players then draw the network of power lines across the map. After first player connects 16 cities the player who can power the most cities wins the game!

Expected playing time is about 2.5 - 3 hours.

One of the few meaty, long games I'm almost always willing to play.  The systems all mesh nicely, and, like most good "economic" games, it's not so much a case of math as it is timing.  Good stuff.

RATING: 9
Which one to like better?  I can't decide - either one is an incredible game.  Perhaps FS only because of the initial geographic isolation (pure balance in the first 8 cities - will cost everyone the same).

If you played this with the new power plants (assuming the city mix worked) this would be superior to Power Grid. However, it's a bit fiddly and long, so I'm not upset that I sold my copy.

Comment: boring, too long.  Paying and earning money takes too much time in a boardgame.
Nice aspects about the player's sequence that changes every turn.

Rather interesting game.  I've played it about 6 times now.  I'm not sure I can get others to play it anymore.

RATING: 7
This might go up as I think we an atypical plant set to work with (only 2 players of 3 players could get plant cards totalling 20 or more because of a fluke removal of only high value cards at the beginning).  Money is very tight (a good thing). You really need to work the margins, and turn order decisions and fuel speculation are all interesting and well thought out. Crayon aspect allows for additional strategies that drive up the route-making costs for opponents, but also added a whopping amount of down-time to the game whilst people did the interlinked maths. I can see why this aspect went in the redesign, but the constant threat of wild network "jumps" across the map probably added as much pleasure, as the endless assessment of costs to do that took away. The arrival mechanism for plants, and the bidding process as a whole were solid. Fuel price manipulation and plant choice was sweet, even if "sweet spot play" could become a bit too calculating for my liking. It is hard to get hold of someone if they have pulled away in a fuel type you are simply not competing in. Not convinced that at times the endgame isn't simply playing out the inevitable.

I think this one might go up over time. It isn't often that I don't nail down a rating with reasonable confidence I got it right (for me). Liked the (long) build-up far better than the flash-finishing. Felt a bit long for the actual game play I got to squeeze in. But the type of game in which I don't mind that too much.

RATING: 8
Even with Power Grid available for the masses,  I still had to get a copy of Funkenschlag.  It's much tighter money-wise than PG, and is mostly a hard-core gamer's game, but ultimately I prefer it to PG.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I think I like this more than PG not for the drawing of routes, but for the slower payouts of the payout chart. The extra length for the drawing of routes is not worth the extra little bit of strategy that it provides, though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Game essentially breaks into three parts on each turn: building powerlines; bidding on powerplants; and purchasing the fuel for them. The trick is to set up the most efficient grid of powerplants as cheaply as possible. After a few plays, the compeition gets to be pretty keen as players seek the "sweet spot" power plants and work the fuel purchasing grid. Pretty fun, but kinda hard to teach and get the hang of, IMO. Known today as Power Grid.

I own Funkenschlag, with a set of homemade hexes for the map.  They are great, but not worth the time required to create them.  Enlarging the map on a printer and laminating it would have sufficed.

Still, a great game, that even non-gamers seem to enjoy.  But a bit too long.  Power Grid is not as good though, primarily due to the change in the payout schedule.

See comments for Power Grid, but add three or four hours to game length. There are more rounds, a less forgiving payout schedule, and you add hours of min-maxing the routes along a crayon-rails board. So people who have time to kill and a lot of experience in crayon rails games might have a leg up on others.

I'm one of the few who prefer this to Power Grid, if only because I believe the latter game is truncated. It ends just as it gets good. Shorter is not always better.

A longer Power Grid with draw-your-own connections and a tighter economy. Whilst I sort of understand the appeal of this game family, I dislike it for the following reasons:
* absolute necessity of in-game calculation
* dry theme
* no comeback options
* fiddly rules
* lengthy playtime
* tendency for enormous AP
* claustrophobic feel

And it goes even longer than Power Grid.

The original Funkenschlag is an excellent game that I'll probably never play again.  I prefer Power Grid because (1) the shorter length is nice, (2) it's less prone to long stagnant periods, and most importantly, (3) the pre-drawn routes eliminate the biggest headache (and waste of time) from the 1st edition.  My rating would be a point higher if the newer edition did not exist.

RATING: 7
I like the economic theme, the dynamic prices and generally how much you have to think about the other players. In that sense it is more interactive than many modern "multiplayer solitaire" games. 

However: 
I dislike the many small rules you need for setting up and administration. That part is very inelegant. Also the colors and graphical implementation is neither visually stunning nor very functional. 

The handicap for the leading player is very effective and helps other players to catch up. But it just feels too strong, because you basically try to avoid being first until the very end. You can not really harm an opponent directly in that game, that is why it needs a catchup mechanic like the one it has. I would prefer some more direct interaction that would let players harm the leader and solve the runaway problem in that way. 

Also, the game makes players calculate so much and so often, it really leads to downtime and a long session. In addition, the luck factor from the cards that are drawn is significant, and way too high for such a long game for my liking. Luck is cool for a quick and casual game, but not for a game like this.

One of my favorites.

This is a very impressive 2001 design and it's actually really just [thing=2651][/thing] except there's more opportunity to screw with your opponents' position (making their routes more expensive by defensive manuevering) due to the crayon-rail board AND the payouts are much tighter (diminishing returns).  Of course, these features also adds more time to a game that I would otherwise prefer over the later design.

Supplanted by the streamlined Power Grid in the rotation, this would come out if you're looking for a longer version, where you can see how the planning and work that went into the crayon network building comes alive with the power stations you buy. Some would say that's more rewarding, but the extra effort doesn't seem worth the extra hour of game time.

Has all the shortcomings of Outpost without the cool theme.
The shortcomings are that once you are behind, you can pack it in.  There is no realistic way to gang up on the leader(s), so after the second or third turn, half of the players are going through the motions and remaining one turn behind the leaders.  The concept is cute, but needs a lot of work.  I have to admit that this is based on one play with five players, but I don't think I'll be trying it again.   The owner had blown up the map (wonders of scanners) to a nice size, but it didn't help the flawed game enough.

Awesome game with a several items to optimize. Your finances, the plants to by, the resources to use, mapping your grid. 
I Liked the different turn order for the different phases - it is an outstanding balancing mechanism. 

I've enjoyed every game I've played. 
Prefer it to Power Grid. I enjoy the longer play - power grid seems truncated in comparison

However Power Grid is much easier to get to the table

There are elements to this version that I like better than Power Grid, but the positives don't outweigh the additional time it takes to play. I do miss drawing routes in Power Grid, though and like that Step 3 is a fully realized phase in Funkenschlag.

Since I work for an electric company, I had to try this game and it is very good.  The only negative I see it is a bit too prone to getting locked up where no one wants any of the available power plants dragging the game to a halt.  

It helps to play with a rule from Power Grid--dump the cheapest available plant in none get purchased in a turn.

I liked this game, but it was a little long (usually around 2.5 to 3 hours). Power Grid (the new version of this game) plays in 2 hours reliably and just is so much more refined, that this one never gets played anymore.

--Jun2013-- It's a cool thing; an interesting ancestral form of Power Grid.  This one is a bit more demanding; a bit more subtle; a bit easier to find oneself way off the pace.  It's pretty cool - but I think I'll be content with the mushier version that's already on my shelf.

Played it with 5 players. Really liked the way you have to plan ahead by keeping track of your finances and what your opponents will most likely do this turn. Absolutely LOVE the 'balance' mechanism that favours the players that are trailing in the score. Keeps the scores closer together and therefore more exciting. Plus it adds a whole new dimension to the playing strategy.

This is a great game, but for as wonderful as it is it is just too long for what it has to offer.  I feel that while the system is beautiful, it isn't substantial enough in compared to something like an 18xx game for that kind of time investment.  

While perhaps it shouldn't be looked down upon for this, I just can't help but think how Power Grid presents most everything wonderful about this, without quite the level of calculation and downtime.  I do like the Empire Builder map, and think it is a genuinely fun and worthwhile element of the game I find that it makes the entire system more cumbersome than it needs to be. Especially with the cities easily getting hidden with the marker so that by midgame you have to continually search the board to figure out where they are.

If this had only come out on its own, I would most likely give it an 8, but now with Power Grid so easily available and easily playable (as opposed to this) this dims in comparison.

Who in the hell is paying so much for this game?  It's so not worth it.  Get Power Grid, and appreciate that Funkenschlag was a prototype, and that it was re-formulated into a better game.  I bought it once for $12, and then traded it for Linie 1, and I felt I got a good deal in the trade.

Only played once, after many plays of Power Grid. The latter is much more streamlined, much faster ... not sure that the crayon rails adds anything (but game time) to this game. Also, the components are not at all comparable - play Power Grid instead!

Excellent game.  See comments on Power Grid.  I do like the connection game better in Funkenschlag (the original), but usually would opt for Power Grid since it's considerably faster.

In some ways I feel that the need to draw your lines and build your connections in the original, make this a better game than the successor, Power Grid. 

I'm sure that the exact opposite is why the game is more popular now though, as not everyone wanted something else to think abut during the game.

We use special hex tiles when we play.  Granted, it took a LONG time to make and cut out all the hexes, but they make each game very different, and the use of whiteboard markers on laminated hex tiles works much better than the crayons on the included map.  People in my gaming group routinely ask for this game even though we all know they know that it may be the only game we play that night since it's so long.

Power Grid precursor with crayons! We play the hex map version, always randomizes things a little better. Takes a little longer than Power Grid to analyze costs, but in the end is more fun! Still, we play PG much more often, and now with new cards and several maps FS is getting to be much less likely to come out.

The underlying economics are a bit-better than in Powergrid, but the crayon-building is more tedious and pointless (since you aren't constructing routes to be reused) than in Empire Builder.  Yawn.

RATING: 9
Yeah if only I could get people to play this but the length borders on too long for most.  I have to agree that this also probably one of the poorest packaged games ever, with blaise game components.  The game itself though is a joy of simplicity and complexity.  After all its failings its still plays wonderfully, and with the updates in the BGG file sections, and if you have the time and put forth the effort you get a nice mostly finished project.  Maybe I'll find some colored pyramids.

Great game even though I played it very poorly.  I just couldn't stop wasting money on new plants.  This game consists of buying power plants, buying fuel, connecting up a network to supply cities with power.  There are 3 phases in which varying number of resources are restocked and you can have incrementally more connections to each city.  When one player has connected 20 cities the game ends.  The person who supplies power to the most cities wins.

Would you believe that this was the second Euro game I ever played?  Seriously!  It took over four hours, and I had very little understanding of what I was doing, but I still came back the next week to play some more.

Honestly, though, I don't see why anyone would want to play this, when Power Grid is so readily available.  This game is far fiddlier and longer, which makes it far less accessible.

First edition of Power Grid. After seeing the original, I'm even more impressed about the development of Power Grid. Transition from crayon rail to board with printed costs shortens the game for an hour, maybe more.

Funkenschlag 2nd Edition is easy to learn, hard(er) to win. Many players in my gaming club like to play this game. Good game for newbies too, a deeper game that keeps them involved and on their toes. 

Getting the right Power Plants on the right moment is a game on it's own! This is something I learned after 3 games. But the 6th time I played it I upgraded my plants too late...leaving me short on cash for paying the better connections.

I've played the game about 10 times now. The last turns can be very critical, an early lead doesn't mean a win... Players that like to calculate all their moves have more chances to win.

I'm more an 'instinct' player, that is why I've only won this game once :)

After many playing sessions my rating will be a permanent 7.

I still have my original copy of this game.  The box is too big, the board is terrible quality (I mounted mine), but the game still shines as long as you don't mind using crayons.  These days it's just easier to get Power Grid.

This is the original version of Power Grid, described by some as "the crayon rails version." It is numbered 399 out of 500 (the limited print run). The components are complete and in very good condition. The German crayons are mostly unused because there are now dry erase markers and an eraser that have been added. The outer slip cover is very good, with only minor whitening and no rips or tears.

after initial solo test play, I think this could rate highly. a lot of decisions to make, balancing needs with monetary constraints. sure the map is small and a bit, but i definitely think it's worthwhile to spend a bit of money to improve the components that let the game down. 2F Spiel is a small co and i think production quality should be given a break for that reason. Particularly if the game mechanic is sound.
First play 08 Feb '04 up to Step1 (building 8 cities). Very positive feedback from game.

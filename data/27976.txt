GAME: Heroscape Master Set: Swarm of the Marro

RATING: 8
I was originally put off by Heroscape until I saw how much enthusiasm Tom Vasel had for the game in his Top 100 Games of 2010 series.

This game feels very little like a war game and the most fun aspect (for me anyway) comes from customizing the battlefield, which characters I am going to play with, and anything else you can think of for each time we play.

Though it is not my girlfriend's favourite, she does play it with me occasionally. Which is more than what I can say for games like Memoir '44.

My only complaint on the Swarm of Marro set is that the creatures are really ugly. I wish there was less Marro-ugliness. :)

From the Reviews: It is clear that there is a rather zealous following for Heroscape, but it is just not for me, lots of dice, mixing warriors from different time, minatures. I would have to be talked into this game from a gamer that I trust before I would try it.

Miniatures games do not get any more accessible than this. The box has an assortment of miniatures and their cards from different factions, glyphs for power-ups, turn markers, dice and tiles for creating 3D maps. The rules for combat and movement are easy to follow, yet not oversimplified and feature a number of scenarios that keep the game interesting.

Lots of Unique figures, but figures from the previous set!  The swamp tiles have no rules attached to them which is a disappointment to say the least.  The common Marro squads are nice, but the terrain really doesn't add much to the set at all.  And the switch of the water tiles really doesn't make me happy.  This is the first set of Heroscape I've been generally unhappy about.

If you enjoy miniatures games but do not want to spend hundreds of dollars on a handful of troops or terrain then this is a "go getta"!

Simple rules make for some great strategic play. Also the whole swords vs tech idea is fantastic. Though the game is no longer in print as of writing, it is worth going to sites that still stock the parts or at the very least the master sets (like this one) and getting them. 

A great game and I hope that someone pics up the license for it soon.

Initial Impression: I feel that this is the most thematic of the Heroscape sets and my personal favorite. The Marro are an interesting army with many weak units that seem to employ swarm tactics on the battlefield. The Hive replaces dead units which can replenish a dwindling squad. Certain Marro abilities are even tied to the swamp terrain. Definitely must play more of this.

Heroscape is a a very light historical/sci-fi/fantasy skirmish game and terrain system built around scenarios and tournament play. The original Master Set was perhaps more effective at bringing out the "tournament play" side of the game, this new Master Set filled with new terrain, creatures, and heroes focuses more on the scenario side of play. A worthwhile purchase for fans of the system and a good way to jump in, too.

[b]Swarm of the Maro[/b] is pretty simple: maneuver your men on the board, then roll dice to attack your opponent's pieces.  You can play until one side is completely annihilated, or you can set other winning conditions.  Some pieces have special abilities that modify their attacking or defending capability.  But the real appeal of this game is the board.  The board is made of plastic hexes that snap and stack together, a little like Lego.  The instructions contain some board designs, but you can design your own.

There are a ton of expansions for this game.  Some consist of terrain pieces, and other expansions are additional player pieces with different special abilities.  And because the master sets have a ton of terrain pieces, it makes sense to have more than one copy to be able to build more elaborate boards.

But the real downside of the game is the price.  It is out of print now, and still in demand and expensive.  However, [i]Wizards of the Coast[/i] have reprinted this as [thing=167698][/thing].

A bold Master Set expansion. I have new love for the Marro as this set brings them out in troves. Some new skins/cards for some older beloved heroes and a whole load of terrain. The swamp themed terrain and swamp water tiles go well both visually and thematically, especially when used with the Ticalla Jungle terrain expansion.  Plus... the Hive. A large immoveable object that can bring dead Marro squad figures back to life. A must have in my book.

This was purchased as an expansion to Rise of the Valkyrie, and has only been played combined. As such, it serves its purpose very well.(It was a no-brainer; we bought this for the same price as it cost for only the terrain expansion, plus it comes with a batch of new figures.)  The figures seem much more powerful than the ones from the first set, but when players draft there is a good balance.  I have not played it as a stand alone game.  The figures are in two definite teams of "good guys" & "bad guys" (Heroes vs. Marro) which keeps more to the original theme.  Players are to take sides and battle it out.  But we always just draft our own armies.  Bottom line; great as an expansion.  No comment as a stand alone game.

Rated for my 9 y.o. son who loves building terrain with heroscape.  I much prefer the Rise of the Valkyrie master set -- the Marro just aren't my thing -- but the swamp terrain is cool to have.  I can see that Heroscape is a great game, but for the length of time these games take, I would prefer to play something else.  Rated from my son's perspective for this reason (as he is a member of the game's target audience).

A nice expansion for the game, but I personally find it a little weak as a standalone set.  RotV played the introduction role better, and it's lack of availability may hinder new players trying to get into the game.

Nice game.  I found that my kids liked building the terrain much more than actually playing the game.  Like many of these types of games, I would probably rate this higher if I had more of it, which would either require a ton of good luck, like I had when I found this set, or the willingness to spend a lot of money on OOP expansions.

Not quite as stand-alone as the original master set, but a must-have addition to the game, especially for anyone with a fondness for the Marro species, which gets two new heroes (a heavy melee hitter and the indispensable, squad-spawning Marro Hive), plus two copies each of three squads. Plus a much-improved version of the iconic Sgt. Drake and four other solid heroes, to say nothing of the new terrain.

Swarm of the Marro includes two of the coolest Heroscape figures ever: Tor-Kul-Na and Major Q10. There are also a lot of common Marro squads which is both a good and a bad thing.

RATING: 8
Just got it. The figures are superior to the originals in all respects. There is new terrain (swamp), and the Marro Hive is very cool, in a creepy way. As we already own a horde of Heroscape stuff, this really augments our existing stuff very well. However, if this were your first foray into Heroscape, I would say this is not as good as the original master set, as there are fewer units in total, and most of them are Marro, so there is less variety than the original set. This is really more like an uber-expansion model than a true master set. MY rating is based on this as an expansion. If I were to rate it as a stand-alone master set, I would give it a "7".

Second "master set" in the Heroscape series, a fantastic collection of game bits where you can fight out battles on a plastic preconstructed game tiles.  I essentially use the pieces as a kit for Songs of Blades and Heroes, but still try and grab the bits for the terrain and miniatures.  That said, this is a must have for the swamp tiles and new Marro miniatures - including the wonderful "hive mind" piece.  Great stuff.

RATING: 4
Played 4 times. I rate the game itself as a 6 because, really, it isn't that great of a game system. (For example: line of sight means almost nothing, since hiding your figure out of line-of-sight is a waste of time when your opponent can simply move 3 spaces forward and shoot you at range.) I wish you had to choose move or shoot to allow more tactical play and positioning. But it is a light game.

BUT LET ME SAY THIS: if you include the building of the battlefield and designing of scenarios as part of the "gameplay" then you can bump my rating to an 8. The terrain and characters are a lot of fun to work with.

One thing I do HATE about the game is how, when I opened my first "expansion pack" of figs, I found that most of them benefitted from other units that I did not own. WHAT GOOD IS THAT?! I should be able to buy a booster pack and feel like I improved what I can do with the game, not feel like I need 12 more figs to make the 4 figs I just got worthwhile. BOO!

Like most HSers, I'm basically treating this as a giant expansion. If you're looking to get into HeroScape, I'd suggest going on eBay and tracking down the [thing=11170]original master set.[/thing] The swamp water doesn't have a huge effect. We haven't used the Marro Hive yet, but I love the detail on it, with the Marro growing in little pods.

As far as the other figures go, Q10 is pretty great, and the new Raelin is fantastic - I don't see a reason to draft the old one now, unless you really can't spare the extra points.  The rest of the figures either remain unplayed or haven't made an impression yet.  (In one game, Shiori was destroyed before I placed an order marker on her, although I've played her since and she's pretty cool.)

I love Swarm of the Marro, but I view it as a large expansion rather than a master set. The original master set (Rise of the Valkyrie) provides a larger variety of units and shows the player what Heroscape is all about. SotM has less variety, but it's still a good set.

A great expansion to a great game.

The sculpts and paint jobs of the new figures are outstanding, and having multiple common squads in a Master Set is a welcome idea. Unfortunately, there's not much terrain, though; and the swamp water is basically green plastic nothing. A bad starter, but a great booster.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Good Master set although I would call it an "expansion set" compared to the first one, but a whole much better than de D&D one. As the first set is difficult to get, this one is a must have in terms of terrain pieces and a decent number of miniatures but with less variability as they're mostly Marro

Not quite the same value for the price as the original master set, but still well worth it. The sculpts look great, I love the swamp water rules, and the hive is quite a conversation piece. This feels more like a BIG scenario than the "full game" feel of the first master set, but for someone who is big into Heroscape like me, this is just fine. I still would recommend you buy Rise of the Valkyrie (the first master set) before this one.

This is a very easy and fun game to learn and play. I want to rate it higher, it is definitively worth the inflated price I paid for it, but it has not seen too much play time among my family. This is mostly due to the fact that not every one likes the theme, and we try to play something every one is interested. Building the board is fun and makes the game feel fresh. My kids have even made some of their own play pieces just by taking old toys they have and making a sheet/stats for them (easy to do with the online templates).

A new Heroscape master set...the first was an amazing bang for the buck, this one is the same way.

Good followup to the original Master Set. Having commons in the Master Set is pretty good since buying a couple Master Sets gives you a lot of terrain and usable figures.

wow, this thing is pretty cool to look at. The big marrow troll thing is cool looking in a funky odd way (there's no way he sprung up out of the Marrow Hive though)...the Hive itself is a very neat sculpt to me, can't say why, but it evokes something in me.

Damn it...do I need more Heroscape crap? I know I'm going to end up with it.

I did end up with it...dang it Amazon! I couldn't pass up the $12 buck offer.

Great game with lots of variety and potential for strategy and tactics -- especially with all the terrain expansions.  Eliminates most or all of the issues that can occur in miniatures games with all the dice-chucking fun.  It's an investment to set up the maps and draft units, but well worth it.

2x of these. Nice quality set, although I pine for the fjords--er, the greater variety of terrain in RotV, and I hope this set doesn't wholesale replace the original master set. For one thing, it's too Marro focused (surprise!). For another, there isn't enough of a sense of a "battle of all time," partly as a result of the Marro-heavy focus. Still the fact that this set has some common squads means having multiple sets is less of a waste than having multiple RoTVs; with WotC also making noise about a third "fantasy" master set for 2008, SotM could point the way to cool, smaller themed sets (Soulborg factory has been tossed around by fans as a good idea). Ultimately, though, SotM gets a point off the RotV rating for its lower piece count, heavy emphasis on swamp and swamp water, and Marro theme.

This is a nice adition to the HS series. Not much new, terrain wise, but practically begging for the upcoming jungle set! Some great new heroes, including the revised Raelin and Sgt. Drake Alexander, and a great basic Marro army, that meshes well with the other Marro units.

I've played rise of valkrye (or however it's spelled) and this game didn't come with nearly as much stuff as the master set one did. Not only that, all of the squads looked very much alike, which was pretty bland after a while. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't as much of a "master set" as the first one was.

This is a tough one to rate.  On it's own, it suffers in comparison to the original Master set due to lack of unique figures, but has the bonus of scriptability in the fight against the Marro (if that's what you want to do).  Personally, I like the variety of the original over the scripted armies of this.  The hive is neat to look at, but doesn't seem to be much of a character addition (I'd gladly have traded it for 3-4 more regular figures).  There are also fewer options for the 3D aspect as there aren't as many elevation tiles.

As an expansion however, it's very nice, with the exception that several of the unique characters are duplicates from the original set.  Boo.  All in all, it smells like the series is getting cheaper (but not less expensive).

Doesn't really matter which Master Set you start with. Either it falls flat instantly for you, or you will buy anything you can get your hands on. At least, I can hardly imagine someone saying: '[i]Hm, this is a nice, well rounded game in this box, there's absolutely no need for boosters.[/i]'. The addictive nature of Heroscape comes from the vast number of thematically and mechanically different units you can pit against each other; Master Sets are just large boxes of terrain pieces, of which you can get never enough. 
Pure, unadulterated tactical fun with extremely high toy factor.

RATING: 9
The best miniatures skirmish game I've ever played.
This Master Set is structures around Marro figures, which feels a little limited for me, but may be more coherent to new players.

PROS
- Amazing terrain: absolutely no other game looks this good when displayed on the table.
- Good-looking pre-painted figures.
- Easy to teach and learn.
- Simple atributes and powers system for the characters, with no complicated rules nor exceptions.
- Simple movement and combat system: no need for rulers nor any other components.
- High level of strategy with the possibility of bluffing and deceiving.
- The possibility of creating an unlimited number of scenarios and variants.

CONS
- The almost inexistent distribution in Spain.
- The fact that it has been discontinued for a lot of years, so finding material isn't easy nor cheap.

Swamp terrain is a good addition, and many of the creatures are very interesting to play.  I think rules should have been made for swamp water movement to make it more interesting, but this is a minor complaint and could be house-ruled.

RATING: 8.7
This new master set is really tanking.  My biggest problem with it is too many marro figures (including the 2x of commons you get), plus they just revamped Raylin and St. Drake Alexander.  Hasbro could of done better.  Plus now you get only 2/3 of the figures and tile for the same great price of 40 bucks.  Too steep for me.  Thank God for Amazons sale, otherwise this would not be in my collection.

RATING: 7
Does not really work as a Master Set, but is pretty good as an expansion. Introduces swamp terrain, too. 

It's a shame that they had to put new versions of Raelin and Sgt. Drake in there, but the other heroes are pretty neat and the Marro Hive is really cool. There are also three pairs of common Marro squads, which is quite nice because it lets you try out the "combining common squads" rule without buying multiple copies of the same blister.

There's a lot less stuff in the box than in [gameid=11170], so everything fits back in the box easily. Includes a checklist of all the expansions, with pictures. That was a nice surprise.

Is a good deal for getting more terrain (includes swamp) but the diversity of characters isn't the same as the original master set.  A few of the characters are repeated from the original masters set (why they didn't put in all new not sure).  Do like getting more Marro units.

Rating is for the advanced version of the game, which takes it up a whole notch from the basic version. Comes with 75 tiles, including water and swamp pieces, and 24 all-time warriors. Beautiful to set up, and of course, sets can be arranged in any number of ways. In 2008 have added the Forgotten Forest and Castle expansions, which allow the creation of more imaginative and interesting battlegrounds. My son Trevor, 10 years old as of April 2009, rated this game a "10".

One of my favorite games of all time. 

Beautiful, inexpensive (it was when it first came out, anyway), well planned out minis game. 

Every time I play this, I really wish I was playing it more.

Nicely done scenarios really add to the game replay. But really there is infinite replayability through creating custom scenarios and custom characters.

This was released during Heroscapes hayday.  This set has the new swamp tiles, and really adds some cool stuff like the Marrow hive and multiple sets of non-unique squads.  A bit lame that they redid some heroes when there is a million new things they could have made, but the units are different enough from their originals that you have some choices to make when building with them.

RATING: 7.5
A lousy substitute for a "Master Set", made only slightly more palatable by the Underdark's D&D Master Set 3's absurd paucity of components.   (To be honest, comparing MS2 to MS1 Rise of the Valkyrie is not fair since MS1 is perfection in component and gaming value)
My biggest problem with MS2 is the inclusion of the horrendously-unbalanced Marro Stingers. I said it then immediately that a 4-unit ranged squad simply can't be that cheap if they can get off that many attack dice. The fact they were made common shows they didn't learn the lessons learned from Marro Warriors and the 4th Mass.
Further, I find it continually hilarious how people who follow the game simply don't understand HS unit design. Many people didn't think the Stingers were too strong, yet years after their release they are still one of the premier tournament units ever made.
If they had made the stingers a unique squad, then the creativity of the Marro Hive would have been the center-point of this expansion and it would have a worthy set.
It's just the combination of so little (in comparison) terrain and common units in a Master Set left a bad taste in my mouth about Hasbro's desires to ream the fans for the buck (not as much as the Flagbearers, though).

I don't think SotM is as good a starter game as Rise of the Valkyrie, because it has less terrain and less variety (by design: lots of Marro units).

Swarm of the Marro adds additional units, terrain and ... that's about it.  Is it worthwhile to pick up?  Only if you can find it at a discount.  Given that the game is now out-of-print, it seems likely only to be available at thrift shops or eBay.  One thing I wish the rules included was terrain movement rules, as every land unit except water, ice and lava are pretty much equal for all units.

In large group plays, the Hive seems a little under powered, requiring a series of lucky rolls to be worth its cost. The Marros themselves seem to fall in to the same hole; interesting but consistently beaten by other units.

All of the terrain and figures are quite lovely, but I'm not quite convinced of their value in-game.

I finally tried HeroScape for the first time this year as a few friends started getting very into the game and buying the game and many expansions. So my first experience was not only with the base game, but with around 10 expansions thrown into the mix as well. It's handy to have friends that are so into the game because they can take care of the laborious setup before you even arrive, since preparing the map for battle sounds like it takes as long as the battle itself (which reminds me of a series of games about tanks, elephants, and goblins). Unlike that series though, HeroScape was really fun. Sure it primarily revolved around rolling gobs of dice and sure it was essentially playing with little plastic army men, which may explain the appeal in great part due to the nostalgia factor for a long-gone youth spent in large part making up rules for grand army men warfare. But despite all that, or more likely because of all that, it's simply fun. I was actually struck by how much more complex the game is than I had anticipated. The base rules themselves are quite simple, but when you throw all of the many units' special powers into the mix, it becomes a lot to keep track of. We played four-player games divided into two teams of two players each, which I think was a great way to structure the battle. Being a long-time fan of team games, from Nexus Ops to Ingenious to Crokinole, I particularly enjoyed the team game elements of HeroScape when played this way. I found the three-player free-for-all to suffer from the same issue as discussed above regarding End of the Triumvirate and Through the Ages. HeroScape doesn't seem like a game I'm going to start purchasing any time soon, given the space it takes to store and the setup time, but it's one I'll be happy to play, especially if we play a team game and someone else sets up the map.

I will put this comment for all of my HS stuff

Simply Awsome - Nice durable pieces, endless map possibilities that are only limited by your imagination.  Basic or advanced game play rules (even the advanced rules are easy to grasp, quite frankly my 11yr old son never liked the "Basic" rules)
You can play the game with one master set but that won't last long, so this game can get expensive if you get carried away (like most players of this game have)

If you like Heroscape, and I do, then you'll probably want this. It has swamp water, and swamp terrain tiles, and the hive is a really cool piece, even if used only as a terrain feature. 

I had forgotten how much fun Heroscape can be, until some friends reminded me by requesting a game. I am fortunate to have been able to snag what I could for this game (it's rather hard to get over here), purchasing items on eBay mostly.

This is a tough comparison to the original RotV set. On one hand, this set offers a better picture of what good Heroscape gameplay can look like by its inclusion of a fully functional Marro army that works effectively together. The original RotV set, with its diversity of units, misses a lot of that. On the other hand, this means that most games you'll play with this set become "the good guys vs. the Marro" which really leaves out the wonderful sense of variety that makes Heroscape so fun. The terrain is similarly limiting and only allows for a few variations on the same low-lying swampy map. 

Overall, I find the cons outweigh the pros here - the set's gameplay is tight, but it lacks the real fun of Heroscape. I would recommend picking up RotV and some small booster packs before this, but if you keep your eye out you can often find it at such a steal of a price that it's worth picking up earlier.

The only "lacking" expansion for HeroScape in my mind was the Marvel edition.  Prepainted minis, hundreds of abilities and build-your-own-map with hex based tiles, HeroScape is one of the best strategic games available.

This is an entry level collectable war game set.  I frame it as a gateway game to Warhammer. :)  The setup can be as much fun as playing the game and it is easily simplified to play as a kids game.  You can also complicate it as little or as much as you want to keep adults engaged.  I have yet to play it with the full rule set.  Its a fun distraction if your looking for a wargame with some tactile and visual appeal or if your looking for a game which is flexible enough to appeal to a wide array of ages and abilities.

Wow, this is so much nicer than the first Masterset!  The quality is through the roof, and the figures are painted so much nicer! True, there are fewer pieces, but what you get are GREAT! And this set is more of a main enemy (Marro) vs. anyone who thinks they can stop them. But only when you have the first one for greater variety.  Good stuff.

Fun, simple miniatures game with very creative terrain, however, it needs more advanced rules to be a great minis game.  HeroScape's greatest asset is its cool 3-dimensional terrain.  This is also its greatest drawback as it lacks portability and takes a while to set up a battlefield.  Scores lower than the Rise of the Valkyrie because it is too heavy on Marro, lacks ruins, and has less terrain.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Lots of terrain, lots of cheap squads, and some of the coolest new heroes in Heroscape.  

Most people will tell you that Rise of the Valkyrie is the better master set to start with.  I think it depends on what you're looking for.  Rise of the Valkyrie has a bit more terrain and gives you a broader sampling of the Heroscape universe.  On the other hand, Swarm of the Marro gives you a themed army of Marro (one of the recurring races in the game) and feels a bit more like a standalone game.  Both are great, and if you want to get into Heroscape, I really don't think you can go wrong by either.

Yes a got a second copy of this set just for more swamp terrain.  Prior to its release I had made my own swamp tiles using sand hexes and palm trees and shrubs from fish take scenery.  This set combined with the original is all you'll ever need (but you'll want more).

Hasbro begins cheaping out on the bits - less stuff for mo money - and lower quality. Still some great additions to the rest of the terrain. Probably should have been a swamp expansion set instead, though.

*First Heroscape set I bought - had lots of fun playing with the models and hexes with my son and daughter.  Became more of a construction and roleplay toy for us, so I never got the chance to play the game.

RATING: 8
Great stuff, but it's more of a supplement to the original master set than anything else. It stands alone just fine, but since the decresed amount of figures are mostly 75 percent marro, this just doesn't have the same creative possibilities to it that the ROTV master set does. Still, for "casual" fans like myself who only buy ONE of each set, it's nice to finally get some new land tiles.

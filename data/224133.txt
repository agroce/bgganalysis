Cousins War adds up to a package that is greater than the sum of its parts - the control of just three areas contested by 12 cubes of each colour and 17 action cards.  There is a certain Twilight Struggle feel to the play of event cards, where the timing of their play in a round and a secondary event that may benefit your opponent generating tough decisions.  There is also a nice tension between playing to win a battle or to consolidate your control of the regions.  Battle resolution throws in some bluff in the style of Liar's Dice.

Production quality and artwork are both good and the rules are fine.

I played this twice and loved it. The use of liar's dice-esque mechanics for the battles is hilarious and adds a level of tension to the game. The cards themselves are interesting as well with kind of a twilight struggly point system.

Good, quick, card-driven game, with a surprising amount of depth. The liar's dice component will either become a real intriguing part of the game as you play the same person repeatedly, or it will become weary (especially if both players don't actually lie). I especially like the card-play progression. Towards the end game there are less battle cards in the deck, so playing certain events becomes much more tense.

This is quite thinky considering there are only 17 action cards. The art is nicely done, the mini map board of England is cute. Only two plays in but I am impressed by the apparent depth for such a small game. The dice bluffing adds another layer. I'll be taking this one on hols with me, the box almost fits in a pocket.

Nice little game.
Probably the combination of things to do are not so much, but the spending point system force you to focus on the better tactic to occupy the most regions.
Better focusing on influence than war.. :)
Great value for the price

Excellent little area control game based on the Wars of the Roses. Clever card mechanics have you fighting battles over each of 5 rounds, using cards to muster and place armies into battle, and to influence one of the three areas of England (The South, Middle England, and The North).

A decent 20 min Twilight Struggle-ish game. Like TS it's good to know what some of the card events are, e.g. the one where the opponent can drop influence in all regions if behind in region control. The map can get kinda clogged towards the end of the game but maybe that's just the nature of it: you have to keep matching opponent presence in each region. So it's kinda a game of inches. Anyway, nice effort and I can see wanting to play this again.

Ok this is a little game, very portable, at the same time there are some neat little mechanics that make it definitely interesting. It is just too early for me to say if this will have staying power, but as for now I like what I see.

RATING: 7
A tiny area control game with interesting mechanics. Uses multi-use cards and the combat is curiously resolved with mechanics from Perudo/LiarÂ´s dice. It's very tense, and bigger than the sum of its parts.
The rulebook left us with a lot of doubts so we had to go look for the answers online. Thanks Paul Grogan and Ricky Royal!

One play only, really nice balance between playing for board position (which is best considered temporary, but will win you the game) and playing to win the battles. Won battles are end game tie-breakers (which I suspect will come into it a lot) as well as a way of dropping influence into an area at the end of the turn when victory is adjudged.

I get the Twilight Struggle-lite analogies (play a card for event or points? manage / mitigate the event cards with a secondary action that triggers for your opponent) but it's way less intricate, and way, way shorter, than TS (a game I love).

Picked it up at the UKGE2017 and I did not stop playing it since :)

It was a bit complex at first though mainly because the whole strategy it packs cannot be simply revealed without playing it... which is a positive fact about the game. 

It gives you the feeling that with every game you learn a bit more. 

The best still is that there is a lot of strategy in such a small box and all the components work great making a concise experience of meaningful decision making.

RATING: 7
The battle resolution is GREAT and I'd love to see it used in more games. That said, the theme doesn't come through strongly at all, and the flow off the game feels off somehow - cubes have tended to pile up in all three regions in my games regardless of what we do, and it rarely feels like the two players' positions are especially well-distinguished.

It's a set of neat ideas that don't quite come together as a whole package. Portability is a big plus though, so it'll see play for sure.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
A very fun (and easily portable!) depiction of the Wars of the Roses. I particularly like the bluffing mechanic and the use of CPs to feed reserves into a developing battle. Players need to maintain a difficult balance between maintaining their influence in England while ensuring they have enough troops to improve their chances of victory in the major battles.

What a great game in such a small package!  Tons of decisions, the cards don't restrict your decision-making, and watch out that you don't commit too many troops too soon as influence on the board.  I found this out when I had no troops left to fight battles.

Highly recommended.

Very interesting 2P game. Reminds me a bit of Twilight Struggle on the aspect of playing the cards for Command Points or applying the Event but has the cool thing that in certain rounds the opponent getting to activate a secondary action on the card.
The passing 1 card to the opponent at the start of the round also adds a strategic dimension to the game.
The Battle resolution is, for me the coolest part of the game, very unique (at least for me) and interesting.
But despite liking the battle resolution a lot, it also seems to me that there are great amounts of luck in this part of the game and that it's very important to determine the winner of the game

A really clever take on 2P area control: a touch of El Grande and a bit of Perudo combining in the most unlikely ways. It feels fresh, new and replayable, and the iterative-type design blends history and balanced card-play. Naysayers might balk at dice-driven combat, but the luck factor is surprisingly minimal.

Having played a prototype version I can't wait to see and play it with the new artwork. I love the history of the War of the Roses, and this game really makes you feel like you are in the time period, trying to turn England white or red! A nice level of depth and strategy to suit both hardened gamers and newcomers.

Very good and small two player game with an appealing theme. Many actions to choose from, enjoyable tug of war, some bluffing, it all works well together. Only problem is with the luck of draw and that in the second part of the game you can run out of cubes and things to do. That can be annoying a bit.

RATING: 6
There has been a rash of 'meaty microgames' lately and this one certainly packs a lot in to 17 cards, a handful of cubes and a tiny map. It pits two players against each other as York and Lancaster in the War of the Roses, each aiming to instantly win by dominating all three areas of England or by dominating two at the end of five rounds.

The cards offer players the familiar choice of spending ops points or using a rule-breaking event, familiar from Twilight Struggle/1960 and more recently 13 Days/13 Minutes. Indeed they also have events that will trigger for your opponent in the right circumstances. Both the ops and the events generally let you move cubes between the various areas in the game - from your supply to your usable reserves; from your reserves to the board; between areas on the map and so on. 

Easily the most fun part of the design is the battle that occurs at the end of each of the five rounds. This is resolved with a Liars Dice style bluff-off. The attacker rolls three dice in secret and then declares 'three fours', 'two threes' etc. The defender can either accept the call and try to outroll it or challenge. If the attacker was bluffing, they lose a unit; if not, the challenger takes the hit.

I have two concerns about the game. One is that the events are rather samey which detracts from the theme - besides the more interesting French Alliance/Betrayal I don't really remember what any of the events were called. The other is that it seemed too easy to get all your cubes on the map, which left us rather awkwardly trying to pull them back off again just to have something to do. I ended up feeling that most of my actions might have amounted to busywork - just shuttling cubes around until the final round where the game was decided. 

There's nothing to be done about the first criticism (which I had of 13 Days/Minutes too) but I'm hoping that subsequent play will disabuse me of the second because it's a neat little game and the battle mechanism is such good fun.

I really want to like this game as I'm impressed with its physical size. 

The small deck means you can try to anticipate what event card your opponent will try to play.

The combat mechanism seemed awesome on paper, but in practice was tedious; the bluffing aspect felt extraneous. We thought it would be vastly improved if battle could be resolved with only one die roll.

Most of the possible actions aren't that interesting; they mostly involve moving cubes around.

Excellent little game!  Plenty of decisions to be made with just a few cards. The mechanics are really interesting and seem to work real well the the theme of the game. The possible down side is that there is a big luck factor because of dice rolls during battles, and it can create huge swings of fortune.  But that also creates some of the fun and drama of the game.

A real plus for the game is that its game system and mechanics can easily be applied to other historical eras.  I created a version that depicts the Napoleonic Wars, and it works quite well.

RATING: 8
Great little portable game. The journey is the thing and this one is a great little ride filled with neat little decisions that wraps up in about 30 minutes.

It's an area control game loosely based on the War of the Roses. What can you expect for 17 cards, a little board, some cubes and three dice? Well, it's a cracker of a tug of war game for one. The finite number of cubes keeps the exchange a close one and we're seeing this going the full five turns in 30 minutes. The battle system seems a little like nothing at first, but it actually works really well and there's meaningful tension, decision making and fun bluffing involved. Excellent stuff! As you get to know the cards you know what to expect and sometimes even choose to take a hit so you can keep a specific card for your plans between rounds. The small package is awesome! For family trips I'll always have room for this, Innovation, Frank's Zoo and Abluxxen.

Notes to remember:
Determine battlefield - If no battle card choose event card without rose or box on this round's number.
Place influence - Only one influence cube can be added to each region. By "added in each region" we take to mean successfully added because the rules call it an "attempt" even though the cube has already been added. ie. Failed additions can be attempted again. First place cube and then roll.
Remove influence - each card can only remove maximum of one opponent's influence cube. (Extra CP are lost.)
Battle active player is the player with most cubes in the battle region. Tied on cubes - start goes to player of battle card.
Battle victor can place cubes into battle region, or adjacent region or into reserve. Can split between one region and your reserve.

One of the best small box two player games out there. Our first play took all of the five rounds, and was decided by the number of battles we had won - meaning that the game could go either way up until the very last roll of the dice. Victory can be achieved each round, however, so you need to be on your guard each turn and try to keep an overview of the possible results of the upcoming battle. And the bluffing during battle is really important (and strangely strategic) too! Add to this the really tiny size of the box, and I can easily imagine that my copy will see a lot of travelling. It looks like a micro game, but really does not play like one.

I never purchased this game to collect all the models and have pretty much stopped purchasing them. I have multiple Federation, Romulan and Klingon Ships with a smattering of Borg. Enough to keep the game fresh and interesting when it hits the table.

RATING: 3
Boring. Every time I play I hate it more. Maybe if I had 3 extra ships it might be a bit more fun but the base game hasn't proven itself to me nearly enough to spend $45 on expansions. Also, the painting isn't very good and half the cardboard fell apart just trying to put things where they belong (ex: pilot tokens)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Having played a bit of Wings of War, this has the elements I like (move planning and variable space) and gets rid of the things I didn't like (tracking the fiddly bits). Good quality materials all-around, save some of the minis which really need a touchup.

RATING: 6
Decent core system but the game gets extremely fiddly with all the special rules and mechanics introduced by the cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I love the Next Generation era, so I'm focusing on the relevant ships mostly. Very similar to X-Wing of course but more mission-based and the ships usually have more crew/upgrades. It's a shame the miniatures are so badly painted though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
One of the only miniatures games I've played (X-Wing being the other).  Miniatures aren't really something that interests me, but this one does.  It's not the deepest game and I wouldn't want to play it all the time, but it's fun to bring out on occasion for a skirmish or a mission.  I played X-Wing first and liked it somewhat, but since playing Attack Wing, I have no interest in playing X-Wing again.  Attack Wing just has more interesting decisions, more interesting fleet building options, more missions, and is simply more fun in my mind.  And I don't put much weight on how nice the miniatures look.  Sure, I'd like it if Attack Wing's minis looked as good as X-Wing's, but that's not reason enough for me to go back to X-Wing.

+Fun gameplay with interesting decisions.
+Plays quick with typically 2-4 ships per player.
+Wide variety of missions.
+Highly customizable fleets.
+Fits the Star Trek theme well.
+Wizkids' Organized Play events are lots of fun.

-Minis could have been better.
-The FAQ on the game has gotten pretty long with all the rules questions about the game, particularly card interactions.

Seems like there are some balance problems (cloaking is particularly powerful but doesn't have any cost associated with it) at the moment which prevents me from rating this too highly. Shame as I'm a massive trek fan.

CULL
Stoopid.

Should've known better after trying the Star Wars game (which is even worse).   It starts with the awful name:  "Attack Wing" is about as unthematic as you can get for Trek.  But the deal-breaker is that there's nothing tactical about movement, and the stoopid movement path makes it very hard to understand where you're going to wind up unless you're willing to let your opponent see you plotting your move.  And since the movements are too large, relative positions can shift unrealistically from turn to turn.   It also suffers from too much chrome for what it is -- too many token-based mechanics just sort of slapped on.  Lacks reference cards for a game that can't get by without them.

RATING: 8
The minis for this game are pretty well molded, but the paint is really lacking. But adding a wash and/or some dry brushing will do a lot to improve matters.
LOVE the maneuver system; it feels very "Star Trek", even though the roots are in the Star Wars game it was licensed from.
Simple enough mechanics, some fun tactical options, and quick gameplay make this one a winner for me.

I don't want to be 'that guy' but I prefer this to X-Wing.  Why?  Partly the source material of course, but also I feel like I'm making more important and tactical decisions in Attack Wing than I do in X-Wing.  Ship loadout and captains are more important in this game as well, or at least has been my experience.  The added depth of shields, cloaking, powers all add to the experience, as does the plethora of scenarios.

Attack Wing was even better than I had hoped. The game plays very similarly to X-Wing, but I believe it makes some excellent improvements, namely in ship customization and available (and potential) scenarios. And the minis are much better than the X-Wing fanboys are saying. 
The cards could be sturdier, but it's not a big deal. Overall, this game is better than X-Wing.

RATING: 3
I like the game mechanics and I love Star Trek, and I play ST:AW's sister game X-Wing regularly. So why the low rating? 

Because of the bad quality of the miniatures. The first ones released looked good. The base set was wonderful and aside from the TOS ships most of the miniatures from first waves were fine. But as more and more ships were released the quality began to go down. Compared with the first ships the later released ships looked like crap. Badly moulded, painted details not appearing where they should, paint clogging details. The plastic used to mould the ships also changed to a softer material. The exception being the Borg cube which was really nice.

I would have loved this game had WizKids only cared about the quality of their miniatures. As the game is now I won't buy any new ships. I will still keep the game and the ships I have. I will occasionally play, since the game in it self is not bad and I love the theme.

RATING: N/A
I DON'T actually own this set but include it as a single indicator that I can play this game using all the ship expansions I have because I acquired a set of the dice and the movement templates. Together with the PDF of the rules, a printout of the damage cards, and counters from the expansions, full play is possible. I of course don't have the ships from this box.
A new Starter box has been released in 2017, so I may get that (if it gets to Australia [we don’t seem to have taken to this like the US]). It has 4 ships rather than 3 (including the Enterprise-D) but 2 each of Federation and Klingon (it’s subtitled Federation vs Klingon) with no Romulan (although the new rulebook still has the old scenarios including a Romulan combatant).

Revised Rules and Quick Start as of Sept2017 for new Starter kit:

Comparing this to X-Wing:
As always with Wizkids, the card quality and the miniatures could be a lot better. On the plus side are slightly changed rules which force players to make more decisions and a very varied lineup of different ships (most of them still to come).

I can see how this game could be fun with the deck building aspect being 50% of it. But I'd rather play the old Star Trek CCG! I'm just not a fan of miniatures.

RATING: N/A
While this has a much deeper level of customization than X-Wing (IMO), the so-so minis and lack of non-capital ships have relegated it to the dustbin (again, IMO).

RATING: 7
Decent game with a couple problems. 

First: the miniatures look unfinished. They have a fairly basic paint job and some assembly issues, while the miniatures in X-Wing look amazing at exactly the same price. 

Second: there's not much care given to faction balance due to the lazy "anyone can use anything for a measly 1 point more" mechanic.

Still, it's a fun game built on a solid system and I find myself always looking forward to the new releases.

I think I discovered that I would not like miniature games, if they are anything like this. The movement of the ships is very fiddly and tedious, and trying to visualize where you will end up isn't exactly simple. "Oh, did I fail to place my ship in just the right position so that you're in my firing range? Let me bump it a bit so I will be." Normally all dice-based combat is fine by me, but since luck did not favor me in my game I was really getting annoyed that there was no possible way for me to mitigate the luck of the dice. Also there's a pretty significant runaway leader issue, so I just sat there and suffered while my opponent slowly finished me off. Hurray for those who like these games they certainly give you beautiful components, but I don't even think playing the Star Wars version would redeem the system for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Uses the Star Wars X Wing system; with a little more going on in the ship building/personality abilities department, but a lot less desirable in the painted miniatures.

I would have preferred this world to that of the Star Wars one, but I can't get into the less than stellar miniatures.

If you're a Trek fan looking for a tactical space combat game with low rules overhead, true to the way space combat has been shown in the shows and movies, and has all the wild variety of X-wing, then Star Trek: Attack Wing is your game,

Whereas X-wing focuses on Pilots, Skills, Droids, and Weapons, Attack Wing focuses on specialized crewman, Captain's skills, technological devices, and upgraded weapons. It feels a bit different from X-wing, but clearly in the same mold. 

Following up: part of the genius of the game is that Captains (and crew, weapons, and technology) are not tied to ships. This allows for lots of what-if and cross-faction builds. The other is that battles are truly sharp affairs that rarely last a full hour between 100-point forces.

Trek fans looking for a thinky but quick-moving battle game should get in on this. X-wing fans looking for more should look at this, too. There are even Missions (scenarios) that come with each ship that you can play so that each game can have more going on than just blasting your opponent—an element X-Wing needs to develop. And I thought the models looked much better in play than they do in the box. Doubly nice to finally play a Trek game that didn't move at a glacial pace.

March 2014: I should note that the game is still in its infancy, but new material has been arriving steadily—both in off-the-shelf ships and organized play participation prizes. There will be dozens of different ships to play with by the time the game is a year old. As a result, the online FAQ and wiki for the little rule book are immense and continue to grow. I can only imagine, hope, and fear what a revised rule-book with revised cards will look like!

July 2014: I still enjoy the game tremendously. But a lot of new ships, cards, and new rules are now in play with many more to come before it is even a year old. Keeping all this material straight is requiring looking at Wikis and FAQs and the BGG page as you head into tournaments. Even "casual" play can be contentious if you don't have handy clarification for how card interactions work. Game play leads me to think that the game has been pushed ahead of necessary development and testing. I'd be happier with more testing, accurately modeled ships in relative scales, fewer cards,  a lot less "bits", and card text that didn't read like it was just thought up on the fly and keyed into a text field.

I'm downgrading my previous rating specifically because of the Borg.  The game is interesting and fun (and I'm continuing to play), but the small flame of game imbalance found a fuel refinery when the Borg came out.  Currently their big ships (Cube and Sphere) have better attack, hit points, and maneuverability than any other ship in the game.  It's unclear if the Scout cube will be problematic.  Point is, the designer(s) seem unwilling to address any of the numerous balance issues with the game, except by increasing the power level of new releases.  I have hope that the game will get better over time, but the current evidence points to the opposite.

Update: Things have only gotten worse.  The speed of releases has gone up dramatically, and the quality of the game has taken a nose-dive.  I'm selling all of my minis.  Anybody who is interested in this game should really be playing X-wing.  Do yourself a favor and avoid this game!

RATING: 1
I thought this was going to be a tactical game, but the card stacking overwhelms the tactical side of the game.  The designers lazily copied too much from X Wing.  Some things work well for fighters but not for capital ships.  The number of hits allows 1 shot kills on capital ships.  Standard equipment does not come standard.  The weapon arcs do not make sense for the ships.  The factions are ridiculously imbalanced.

If you get into Star Trek: Attack Wing, then this is what you are in for:

card effect stacking that wipes out any hope of it being a tactical game; horrible mash-ups of abstracted rules & pathetically referential phrases that pass for wonderfully thematic; card interactions that got the FAQ up over 200 edits before it conveniently got reset by someone else taking over; severe imbalance issues; ships not equipped with weapons that come standard; 1 shot kills on capital ships; ships that remain fully functional even when they do take damage that doesn't finish them off in 1 shot; ships that are of comparable abilities despite the fact that they are of designs that span 200 years of getting bigger and more advanced; better firing arcs on older ships than on newer ships; 
crews so incompetent that they have to be told several times to go to battlestations; crews so incompetent that even with several hundred persons aboard, can only do 1 thing at a time

Having lots of fun with this at the OP events at my FLGS. :)

Edit: Dropped from an 8 to a 6. This one feels like it has jumped the shark. At it's very core, it's a great game, but I've become disenchanted and lost in all the dozens of ships and hundreds of cards that have been released for this. Tough for an experienced player and new player to have an even match.

(I have a few dozen ships for this, including 5 or so tournament prize ships and 4-5 opened blind boosters from the OP events. Also TONS of terrain and resources from the tournament events.)

Terrible miniatures and eyesore level scaling issues... game play is Meh. 

This game is Trek in name only. The ships do not maneuver or have the same tactical abilities as their on screen counterparts. Phasers, Disruptors and torpedoes are not represented well in this game. In fact, except for the names, the weapons, ships, defenses and crew all have almost nothing in common with their on screen counterparts.

Unless your thinking stops at "that card has a picture of Captain Kirk on it!" and you give no further thought to the subject, nothing about this game feels very much like Star Trek.    

The card building component is far too powerful and can win or lose a game before dice are ever rolled. The tactical element is nearly nonexistent... the problems are many and the bad writing and lack of play testing of new releases has only made things progressively worse.     

Not worth investing in, even just for the miniatures. 

For a "miniatures" game WizKidz shure did not put much effort into their miniatures... a huge disappointment.

Its X-Wing with Star Trek and slightly tweaked rules.  Since my friends are more Trekkie that Star Wars this gets to the table a little more often.  I originally gave it a 9, it is a bit clunkier than X-Wing.  It is nice having so many new ships as long as you are not a completionist.  However, all the new expansions keep making the game clunkier and clunkier thus the lowered grade.

Don't go into this game thinking X-Wing, that will be your first mistake, tackle it as if you would any new game you come across.

I seem to be in the minority here but I like this game better than Star Wars X-Wing.  I think the movement and combat feels more like the slower naval battles seen in Star Trek than the dogfighting in Star Wars.

I enjoy the game play on this game, I just wish wizkids had put the effort into the game pieces that Fantasy Flight has put into it's (elder) sister game, x-wing. I'm a star trek fan though and I already repaint game pieces in other games I own, so it's not out of my way to repaint my little ships. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Pretty much an X-Wing miniatures clone. There are a couple different actions, and there are separate captain cards, but that's about it.

Of the two, I would say X-Wing is better, mostly because I think the damage system and explodey nature of the ships is more thematic in X-Wing. For capital ships I would expect damage to hinder the ship in some way, but nope.

In addition, Attack Wing is more susceptible to gaming the point system for ship construction. This is in part due to some rather suspect point values that have been assigned to some of the ships and crew members. Consequently, you should absolutely avoid the tournament scene and their uber combos, especially since you can only get certain cards there, effectively turning the game into a CCG. Lastly, maneuvering is less important than in X-Wing because of the typically wider firing arcs, which makes it more of a rock-em-sock-em dice fest than an interesting space combat game.

I guess it's still fun if you're in the mood for something light and aren't playing competitively, but I'd rather play X-Wing if I want something on that level, or Star Fleet Battles (or Starmada) if I want something heavier that's still Star Trekky. Overall, I find the popularity of this game somewhat baffling, and the behavior of WizKids rather disturbing.

Played solo so far (Fed vs. Borg Tactical Cube.)

Good. Miniature quality is no where near X-wing. If you're familiar with the Sails of Glory set, or even Wings of War, it's more along that line. Miniatures aren't really sized to scale relative to one another, but given the breadth of Trek ships, it'd be hard. The cards were all one size (unlike XWing), but I didn't think they're nearly as good in quality. WizKids seemed to cheap out on the production value here while still charging MSRP the same as XWing, which has far better production value. 

That being said, was good. I liked the variety of actions and firing arcs. I would judge this a must-have if your a big trekkie. If you're only looking for a space-miniatures game to play, move to XWing (fighter battle) or Star Wars Armada (cap ship fights - IMO .1% better than XWing for that reason!)

Would give this even higher marks if not for component problems. Cards are too thin although they are sturdier than initial impressions might indicate and the tininess of the TOS Enterprise is really ridiculous.

I have revised my previous rating for this game as I have become incredibly disappointed in the way Wizkids have handled it in the last year or so. Don't get me wrong its a still a good space combat game, but as Star Trek it is pretty disappointing.It suffers from the same problem that Heroclix did, let's just make a giant mash-up of whoever vs whoever with no rationale whatsoever. Its a minmaxers dream but a thematic gamers nightmare.

At this point, and though it pains me to say, I have regret and remorse picking up this game and investing so heavily into it. By far this is my most played games (many were prior to 2015 which is when I started logging games). I don't regret those 100+ games, I met tons of gamers around town but sadly the heyday for this game is over because of mismanagement which has basically shrank the player base to near zero in my area. Everyone else around me has dropped. Meanwhile I see the XWing player base continue to grow and that's where the regret comes in. I bet on the wrong horse. The product feels rushed, unpolished and designed to push product out rather than develop a strong game which is such a shame because the optimism that I had early on made me ignore what was looking at me right in the face, hoping that one day the game would live up to what it could be. Sadly that day never came.

An amazing game based off a great system.  Attack Wing brings the fun and gameplay of X-Wing into the Star Trek universe.  The models are not all in scale with each other, but the gameplay more than makes up for it.

It's an interesting dog fighting sort of game, they didn't really change the mechanic to suit Star Trek style ships so it feels odd to use huge starships like fighter jets.  

Poor build quality.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
STAW has fun/accessible gameplay and interesting ship load-outs. There is a lot of variety in races, ships, upgrades and missions. It is easy to teach new players so long as you build a couple of ships for them. 
Most importantly the games "feels" like Star Trek. The upgrades exude character and lend the right flavor to each ship and faction. 
I have heard complains about the lack of a "full stop", but outside of initial posturing, starships in the ST universe are anyways in motion during a fight. More importantly, it's a game and should be fun. Ships stopping would just be less engaging to play. 

However, the component quality is a mixed bag. Nothing is terrible, but little is great. Cards are flimsy so you may want sleeves. Some waves include lower quality chip board. Models have ok details with very basic factory painting. It's all perfectly serviceable.

+ Star Trek may be my favorite fictional universe. 
+ This game offers a brilliant mix of strategy, customization, theme, and depth. 
- The format is only slightly better than collectible. Be prepared for your wallet to boldly go to WizKids.
- Support for the game has dropped off recently. They've run out of legitimate ship ideas, too many reprints with a different name and slightly different cards.

FFG star wars X-wings cash cow sibling.

Wizkids bought the FFG design and are milking it with a star trek theme slapped on. 

Ships are a lot more powerful (Falcon equivalent) can now go backwards, cloak and fire out the rear arc as standard. 

Nothing particularly new or special here. I suggest picking a theme your prefer (star wars or star trek) and sticking with just one.

The B/f loves this system and has all the purchasable ships and a DS9 model, and at the rate they are coming out I am not going to try and keep the collection up to date with them. This one entry will cover all Attack Wing ships.

Sold complete collection in 2017.

This game system doesn't scale up to capital ships properly. It didn't feel like star trek, and the default values on the cards were terrible for a balanced combat - as well as being terrible models and quality components compared to X-Wing. Stick with X-Wing.

I've always preferred Star Wars to Stark Trek, so I was surprised to find that I like ST: Attack Wing just as much as X-Wing, if not more. As with X-Wing, though, I have enough friends who own it that I feel no need to start collecting myself.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.75
PROS:
- Star Trek!
- Lots of variety in builds and combos.
- Flight Path system really matches the large capital-ship theme nicely.
- Planning ahead and utilizing your actions make each turn important. I almost never feel like my choices don't matter.
- The game does a good job abstracting a lot of complex systems into a believable and immersive experience that won't take your entire day.
- It is just complex enough for what it is, and not too simple that you get jolted out of the game by confusing abstractions.
- Non-collectable miniatures and cards allow you to pick and choose what ships you want for your fleet, and for the most part, ship expansions are worth the money.
- Each expansion comes with a unique mission. So as your game expands with new ships, you'll also be expanding your mission selection to better cater to different tastes.
- Once a little TLC is added, the ships look good.


CONS:
- Wizkids. That should be enough to explain the below cons, but read on if you wish.
- Uncomprehendable model quality. Some ships look beautiful, and others look terrible and rushed.
- Overall physical quality of components; The cards are really thin, and the miniatures are decent at best but getting better as the newer expansions come out. TCL required, but once a wash is thrown on, results are much improved. 
- Lots of weird choices in OP prizes and exclusives. You never seem to know if they will release the prizes as normal expansions later or if you should drop the 30+ dollars to get it off ebay.
- Lastly, screenshots of the series is "good enough", but original art wouldn't have been THAT hard, and it would be fun to see some expanded universe characters in the game.

X-Wing and Attack Wing:

X-Wing Miniatures are better but more expensive if you include the larger expansions.
Attack Wing has more options with cross factions, cheaper and wider number of expansions. 
X-Wing has a much larger fan-base which makes it easier to find players.
Attack Wing has a more playable starter box (cross factions, 3 major ships, good upgrades). 
Both have the same basic mechanics with small differences (namely the captains are separate from the ships in Attack Wing rather than one-in-the-same cards in X-Wing, Attack Wing has more shield tokens but less defense dice in general, X-Wing has more of a dog-fight feel, opposed to Attack Wings dreadnought battles).

Both games are great. X-wing looks better imo. Attack Wing plays better, imo.

The comparisons to X-Wing are of course inevitable. On the plus side, playing with buffed-up capital ships packed with upgrades is a bit more fun than dogfighting to me.  On the negative side, the paint jobs are pretty poor compared to the X-wing minis.  I like Trek more than SW, so that might make this better to me.  The addition of true missions is a big plus as well.

The best thing about Start Trek Attack Wing are the missions that come with the expansions.  The missions in this base set are not very good but the ships are extraordinary.  I don't think you need more than one copy of this, unlike X-Wing, but you really do have to get a couple of expansions.

The system of choosing and executing movement is brilliant and I think there is a lot of space for further development. The game itself was a disappointment unfortunately.

I really love this game, but there are a couple of issues.  All in all, I find that WizKids has been pretty sloppy with consistency and wording of the game.  The minis are okay, but the scale from ship to ship is terrible.  Still, the game really captures the feel of starship combat.  The options for customization are great.  The maneuvering creates a situation where you need to be really tactical in order to win.  All in all, a great system and a great game.

I played X-Wing and got into this as well but it soon got out of hand with the number of releases, the fact that all the factions could be intermixed, under-development, no proper FAQ and the OP giving out ships that couldn't be obtained anywhere else.

Not as good as X-Wing, starting by the miniatures completely lacking in scale and quality. Yet it does solve a few issues, as the IP allows for many more factions, increasing variety, has IMHO best scenarios (including a few for more than 2 players) and allows the player to buy only the faction he wants to use.
Can be a solid option for Star Trek fans.
Best with 2, but can me played by more people.

RATING: 6
Have to rate this lower than X-wing (by a lot) due to the low quality of the miniatures.  The publisher needs to either decide that scale isn't important (D7 vs Galaxy Class) or it is (D7 vs classic Enterprise).  Various models have engine nacelles bent out of shape or poorly angled stand joints.  Paint quality is always lower than X-wing by a huge margin, even though the price point is the same.

Besides the miniature quality, I think STAW has a few game issues that include:

- firing from cloak and still getting the cloak defensive bonus for the rest of the turn (again, X-wing did this right and STAW didn't).  cloaked ships are almost always better for the points than a non-cloaking ship.  In SFB, cloaking is at least a 15% point penalty, and SFB cloaking isn't as good as AW cloaking.

- too many ships have firepower that greatly exceeds even good defensive abilities.  making these big ships explode faster than X-wing fighters is not thematically good.

- many of the ships (e.g. Borg) are simply not balanced at the published point value, particularly with certain non-faction upgrades.  since I don't play the tournament scene and I don't setup scenarios with non-faction upgrades, I can work around this, but, again, this isn't a problem in X-wing.

So, STAW will hit the table from time-to-time because I am a Star Trek fan, but X-wing will be the choice the vast majority of the time.

Based on the Wizkid nonsense of exclusive game elements and fanboy inability to accept how flawed the game balance is, I should penalize my rating a couple of points down to '4' or less.

due to the game imbalance and miniature quality issues, my collection will freeze with the following:

(2) Federation Galaxy
(2) Federation Miranda
(1) Federation Defiant
(1) Federation Constitution
(1) Federation Enterprise (1701-A)

My friend is a huge trekker so we got this one over X wing as he was much more taken with the idea of this one. I really like the flightpath system and the models are not as amzing as the x wing ones but I'm used to painting minis so will repaint them myself. I'm a little bothered by the scale/base size though as the targeting is base to base and so it does mean that a small nimbel ship is technically as easy to target as a giant battle cruiser because they are on the same size base. Even if the models weren't bigger I would have been happier with a different base size. Apart from this it is a fun and simple to play minis game.

Easy to handle, it shares 80% with X-wing rules. But, despite being a bit under X-wing for quality material, Star trek Attack wings beats it for games wealth and possibilities.

For instance
- 2 to 4 players rules since the begining
- Each ship extension field new scenarios.
- Tournament rules & Add-ons such as Flagships and Reinforcement offer novelty and expand interests and strategies of the game.

If I were not entirely burried in Legion models and other board games, I would be a lot more interested in getting more into this game.  The models are ok and with some light touch ups with paints, they look great.  The game itself though is where it really shines.  Great releases on a very strong consistent basis and plenty of room to expand.  Great streamlined rules which are easy to approach and a complexity within the customization of ships crew/gear/etc. that really entices you to expand your collection and try new combos.  

Highly recommend.

While I collect Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures and greatly enjoy that game, I consider myself lucky that my brother has this Star Trek version of the game system.

My favorite game that uses the flight path system, mainly because of the theme.  I am a proud Trekkie, but the game has a lot to offer to all gamers-even the ones that have no idea who won The Dominion War or the difference between a Warp Matrix Flux Capacitor and a self-sealing stem bolt.
  The rulebook is well laid out with clear illustrations and gets new players firing phasers in no time.  The models are excellent for the price(and amount of work that I have to put into them...zero!).  The theme is excellent...a perfect fit to the mechanics.  The one drawback is the collectable nature of the expansions..raise shields over your wallet!

RATING: 3
Theoretically fun.  Entertaining with scenario limitations and house rules.  Balance is complete trash.  Important gameplay mechanics like fire arcs, special rules, and maneuverability are not accounted for in resource costs.  A ship with a 360 fire arc in a game about simultaneous movement should probably pay for that extremely strong ability, but alas, they do not.  The victor of most matches can be determined by looking at builds and rolling some dice.  Moving miniatures is essentially a formality.

Strategy in this game is very meta.  It essentially boils down to constructing a fleet and attending enough events to receive powerful cards that permit you to nullify and bulldoze those who do not have access to the same resources.  Alternatively, can always just buy a Borg or two and then reduce the game to a pile of dice rolls as well.  A coworker suggested an interesting gameplay variant where we both attempt to program scripts that dictate the actions of stacked Borg cubes based on minimal input.  We would both take our feeble AIs to a tournament via laptop, and then see who can get further while making no decisions.

I would not recommend this game to anybody.  There are other Trek games that offer deeper experiences, and there are other games that use flightpath which are not so overtly designed to monetize whales and increase player retention through participation awards that offer in-game advantages not available to other players.  This game is the closest thing I've ever seen to a tabletop version of a free-to-play mobile game, and it disappoints me that one of my favorite franchises is associated with this rubbish.

The best use for the ships is as Christmas ornaments.  Some of them are super cute.

RATING: 7.5
The Wings of War skin for Star Trek. I think that this game works very well, the theme has been improved to the point of being clearly related to the Star Trek universe. Basically, the ships are configured as you would expect: huge ships with bad movement which means easy to hit, big shields and powerful weapons. If you are able to fire a photon torpedo directly into the hull, that ship is history.
I like the game, it is fun and it works, and it has a lot of possible races to be played! One issue, here in Spain, is that Star Trek is not as popular as in the US or other countries and it may be difficult to find a wide range of ships. In one of the trips that I made to NY I went to a store and bought 5 or 6 ships that were not possible to be found here.
Having said that, the ships have such a huge destructive power that it is better if you make a fleet with, at least, 2 ships per side, better if 3 or 4. Otherwise the game can be very short. Very careful with strong direct attacks people!
Positive:
1. Highly thematic
2. Many races available
3. The mechanics work very well (cloaking, I love it!)
4. It is not too long
Negative:
1. More than 1 ship should be used per fleet

Same as X-wing really. I hear there are some nice scenarios which may even elevate it over X-wing, and there might have been an added feature here or there not sure I recall correctly but I do personally prefer the SW theme as I was never a Trekkie.

RATING: 3
Something about Attack Wing has always gnawed at me. I had enough fun playing it at first, despite the game's uneven quality, both the mechanics and the components. Then Wave 4 showed up and it hit me: The designers really don't know what they're doing with this game. It should have been obvious from the outset. They took X-Wing, pulled out the formula used to balance the ships, replaced it with an hilariously bad stats x2 formula, and reduced the number of upgrades to just four. The effect of this on the game, combined with the long shadow that Cloaking casts, changes the game from maneuvers and list building, to mostly just list building. Who can stack more dice for the Alpha Strike. While the game should have made changes to distinguish itself from X-Wing, these were not the ones to make.

Additionally, while the game was playtested for faction mixing, purists believe the rules in the book grant them the ability to have the final say in how the game is played. This has had an incredibly obnoxious effect on the board culture, compounded by BBG's already toxic environment. Lastly, the enormous FAQ released contains so many unintuitive rulings that the rule book might as well reference it as "additional rules". Or maybe a FAQ should actually come out on the official website of the game. And since now WizKids is pumping out barely playtested models each month, this problem is only going to get worse.

The game gets a pass from fans for having the Star Trek license but, while the game definitely isn't as lazy an attempt as the Heroclix version, it is a waste of a good property. If you don't care about the properties, stick with X-Wing, if you're a Star Trek fan, don't let them bilk you out of your money with this half-assed attempt to cash in on something you love.

RATING: 8
Space combat game almost identical to X-Wing.  Elements in Star Trek make it feel more like Space cruiser combat as opposed to small fighter dogfighting (X-Wing).  Game caters to more casual players with missions in every expansion as well as 2 in the starter.  

Good game if you're a trekkie and enjoy fast not-too-in-depth games.  (1.5 hours max for playing 100 point games, or missions)


I should note that I originally gave this game a "7" rating, but after being on this board, playing it lots, and seeing the support that one of the game designers gives to make sure to explain all the rules... this game is now a 9.  I'm hooked.  I wish X-Wing had a following like this, missions, etc.  The ONLY downside (and I'm not sure its that big of one because I enjoy it) is that you're going to be a good miniature painter if you get into this game pretty heavily.  


After almost a year playing this game, I've settled on "8" for it.  The main responsive designer has moved on and the 2nd one isn't as responsive as the first.  Too many ships released means a VERY large FAQ.  And now with the Borg out there, there is little (in a tournament environment - my favorite) to push you to play anything else other than the challenge of taking down the Borg.  Still a very fun game for the missions, but at this point (8/2014) I've sold my whole collection to play other space fighter games.

This game is great!
Very epic battles, character mechanics fits their nature and are well themed, which, in my opinion (not a very popular one) gives this the edge over X-Wing (although lets face it they're mechanically identical).

Game time can drag on a bit with inexperienced players (or in larger point games) however I would play this more if I knew more people that played it.

I have had issues with poor balance and power creep.  Also personal preference (and not part of the rating) is the quality and painting quality of the figures and the fact you can play any crew on any ship faction.  Not as thematic as I thought.  Finally the prized add an over power to the game which only have the option of winning through spending money which doesn't give everyone the ability to build fleets to the same level.

Another flight path, and in fact the very first one I played. This game started off great, and out of all the board games I've played I have easily put the most amount of time into it. But over the course of the game it has gotten more and more unbalanced to the point where there are now ships that can easily smite other ships. Some ships are simply unplayable because of this, as before this crazy redirection these ships were able to be ran. Simply disappointing to see the direction this game has taken.

This game has fluctuated around the 9-10 range as I've tried to figure out how much of my love for it is due to Star Trek.  I mean, the tactics and fleetbuilding are great, but are they "Top 5 Games" great?  I've decided that it doesn't matter.  10.

I really like what has been done with the mechanics in this game vs. X-wing. However, I have some issues with the production quality. The ships in the starter I played with had some glue showing on the minis and the paint was not very precise. The worst offenders for me were the cards. Some of the images are very high quality, while others look grainy or pixelated. Also, many of the captians and crew have the tops of their heads cropped off. As I mentioned earlier, mechanics wise the game is very solid, but I am disappointed with the production quality. Perhaps I got a bad batch?

Already own X-Wing, and D&D Attack wing

Miniature game, that plays like X-Wing and Wings of war... but is multi-player. X-Wing has a dog fight feel, vs. the crew importance of Attack wing. X-wing has better quality minis for the money. Already have Star Trek Fleet Captains. 

Will have to play test first with Rik.

Well, it's the best option for Star Trek ship combat outside of the Starfleet Universe that I'm aware of, and the core mechanics are pretty solid.  For me personally, I find that casual games are still a lot of fun.  Wizkids has made some questionable design choices, to say the least, though, which have lead to some pretty unbalanced, bordering on broken, units and card combos.

I've noticed this game is pretty well balanced among the different factions (Federation, Romulans, Klingon, etc.).  I heard how deadly the Borg were, but when I play as them in a game, it didn't take long for two Federation ships to dispatch me with decent-not-great dice rolls.  The Borg have incredible offense, yet weak defense, but I digress.  With WizKids' latest announcement that no more miniatures are coming out, I think this game sees its shelf life about to wind down.  Still, it's a fun game.  Personally I prefer X-Wing as I'm a Star Wars fan (not a Trekker) and both games play very much the same.

A game that has star trek ships in it. I guess it was designed in a day by someone who saw the flight path system and said "Hey, do we have any intellectual properties lying around that we can make money off of?" Still, I enjoy the ships, and the Cloaking mechanic is awesomely implemented, but ships are not even slightly in scale, the stats for ships make no sense, and for some reason ancient federation ships have comparable stats to state-of-the-art ships. But hey, Star Trek, so I basically have to play it.

I like Star Trek so I have made the investment in this series rather than some of the others.  The game plays brilliantly with players selecting their maneuver, taking an action and attacking other players. There are missions in the game, ship captains and other crew.  

I cannot say enough good things about this game.  If you like Star Trek, you will like this game.

RATING: 6.3
It's big capital ships maneuvering and trying to get in those big shots. The movement system is an old staple these days with a long history. Some ships may feel just plain impotent against certain others so bringing a bunch of small ships against a bigger one may not work as well as you might think, though the opportunity to whittle down a big opponent is there. 

The theme breaks down a bit because of the mechanics. If you are a fan of the show you will wonder at some of the firing arcs provided.

Cloaking seems to be very powerful indeed as it comes with big defensive bonuses which take a couple of rounds to deal with.

Usually, I avoid the games with potentially long purchasing checklists., but my kid loves Star Trek, which is why this is in the family collection. I love Star Trek, too, but FlightPath is all about combat rather than exploration.

Regarding FlightPath, I empathize with [url=https://www.reddit.com/r/WingsofGlory/comments/2z3k9o/im_andrea_angiolino_ask_me_anything/]Andrea Angiolino[/url], the designer of Wings of War/Glory. Imagine how you would feel if a publisher redeveloped your work into something similar but cut you out of the credits and royalties -- and dropped your games.

[b]I love the variety of ships and upgrades to choose from. Great fun with other Trekkies.
At the most basic level, it's easy to play. Errata, rules updates, card synergies etc. don't exactly make it newbie-friendly though. You need a large surface to play, and lots of room and a good system for storage.
I hate the OP exclusives - too difficult and expensive to get. I also stopped bying more ships around wave 20 - I probably have more stuff than I'll ever play already, and the value-for-money ratio isn't very favourable.[/b]

This went off my radar when I saw the ships, which looked so bad next to X-Wing's ships that I lost interest. I was pleasantly surprised to find out, by playing it, that the ships are the worst part -- it's a fun game.

The movement arcs make it feel like capital ships doing the maneuvering, not fighters, as does the punishing damage they do. I like how configurable it is, with ships, equipment, weapons, and crew all having point costs; you get lots of options.

The core of Wings of War, the other game in this vein I've played, is just as enjoyable with Trek ships as WWII planes: Trying to out-think and outmaneuver your opponent, and in my case usually failing and doing a lot of ramming ("ramming," in Attack Wing, as there's no actual ramming).

I'd happily play this again, and I'd like to try it with more than one ship per side.

While this game isn't perfect, and has some broken combos, it is still a really fun game with a lot of great scenarios.  The variety of ships and cards is enough to keep things fresh for 100's of plays.

Faction pure can solve a lot of issues, as can going up to 150-200 points. The games may take a little longer, but that's ok most of the time.

I loved wings of war back in the day but found X-wing a poor substitute. This is the true sequel to and evolution of the wings of war concept.

Great scenarios, added tactics that come from functional shields and cloaking, and actions that make thematic sense... Means that this is my new spaceship combat game of choice. Plus the Star Trek universe has so many great ship options... They won't be scaling the bottom of the barrel for a long time! 

May this game live long and prosper.

I was afraid that this was going to be like dogfighting in space but the dials are limited enough that it feels like capital ships maneuvering. Formations matter more and since you have fewer ships, synergy makes a bigger difference.

Much like Star Wars:X-Wing in mechanics.  However, it is much more focused on fleet actions rather than dogfighting.  This is mainly accomplished by equipping your ship with a caption, crew, and equipment in such a way that the ships have synergy between them.  Because of this, it seems that there is a tremendous advantage to those who have invested much time/money into the game.  However, I have only played experienced players in tournaments, and I have not invested much time into researching the cards, etc.  Also, the ships are not as good as X-Wing.

Started collecting this last January. I have to be honest and give this game a mediocre review. I like the ships and everything, but the models are just cheap. I've already found the plastic stands to be breaking and it'll take some glue to at least fix the Khazara. Along with the cheap plastic pegs, there is also the fact the base game doesn't include enough dice, especially if cloaked ships want to roll defense die. You'll have to buy another set. You can also forget about wanting to port the base game around in the original box unless you're careful, because the window on the front. As for the actual game itself, It's something casual to have fun with. I think with alot of ships you could have some knockout drag out battles, though that would be costly. Seems like this game is at the end of it's shelf life though.

I think this is actually a better game than X-Wing.  I really like X-Wing but it can sometimes be so hard to actually destroy another ship, which causes the game to take a little too long for its own good.  This game doesn't have this problem - it's deadly!  The counters and cardboard components are nicer in this too.

On the other hand, the models and particularly the paint jobs in X-Wing are much better than the Star Trek ships.  Also, as I was never much of a Sar Trek fan I've rated it the same as X-wing.

Liked it more than X-Wing at first, but got burnt up by the further development of the line by Wizkids.

I like the scenarios, and the customization options for the ships. Too bad the expand ability and combo-driven nature of those kind of break the theme for me.

The models are pretty cool -- nice that they come painted. Obviously needs many of the expansion packs to get the most of out it, which can become expensive.

Rules are a bit of a mess, and the errata found online only really makes it worse.

The die luck is a problem, but so too is the fact that in the damage deck there's one card called Hull Breach which just destroys your ship if you draw it. I generally liked this game until I played Star Wars Imperial Assault, and that really opened my eyes to what could have been done with this game. The directional shields mechanism in particular.

This game also promised scenarios as a step up over Star Wars X-wing. I was excited by this, but ultimately new ships came along that packed so much damage in a single shot that going for the scenarios didn't seem realistic. I was also disappointed that despite the base game coming with a ship for three different factions, there were barely any multiplayer scenarios designed.

IMHO, much better than Wings of Glory. It's more straightforward, more intuitive, simpler rules... yet strategically deeper. The fact that you customize your ships with 4 types of upgrades (captains, captain tricks, weapons and crew) opens up many options and improves replayability a lot :)

Also, kicking Klingon ass with the Enterprise never goes out of style ;)

The rules are essentially the same as X-Wing, but there may be greater depth with the addition of captain and crew cards. That said, this game is far less balanced than X-Wing. Higher attack values versus the limited defensive dice generally moves the game along quickly. 

Picked up second copy for additional dice and ships.

Excellent game. You should buy it! You can play with the minis right out of the box, or you can spend a few minutes making them look really nice with a custom paint job. The stock paint jobs are only so-so, but the models themselves are nice and the game is fantastic. It's like X-Wing but with more depth of play.

Almost, but not quite, exactly unlike Star Trek.

If you want to spend hundred of credits on buying cheap tin toys with poorly printed cards purely in order to build a canon-mashing Frankenship that will win or lose before the game has even begun, based entirely on whether your opponent has spent and Munchkin'd more, then fill your boots.

Be aware that you'll need to keep spending though unless you want to become the guy who deploys his treasured fleet only to have his opponent wave a bunch of tournament cards in your face and sneer "So, do you want to bother actually playing this out?"

However, if you like your Star Trek starship tactical battles to actually be based around Star Trek, starships and tactics, then I suggest that you look elsewhere.

Attack Wing, in brief is:

Pay money.
Min-max your ships.
Place them down.
Make a conservative move, it doesn't really matter what.
If you have bought better ships and cards than your opponent, then roll a huge handful of dice, win, gloat, and pack up.

Definitely one to try before you buy.

RATING: 3
There are some problematic issues with balance, especially at the competitive level.  Lack of player factions (players can use whatever ships and cards they want mixed in a list) coupled with a broken costing system leads to overly efficient options, which creates an ironic situation where the game has dozens of ship choices but only a handful are played by competitive players (and the same is true of Captains, crew, etc.).

Cards are sometimes unclear, and the FAQ is a 100+ pages forum post.

Thematically the game doesn't feel like Star Trek at all anymore.  An ever-popular build is one where Weyoun uses a Romulan crew and a Ferengi tactic to "surrender" over and over and over, meaning that if it's built well it can cancel attacks indefinitely and never take any damage.  Yawn.

The FlightPath system is very much fun, and this game does make my inner Trekkie very much happy. 
There are some issues with balance, but it's a quick and fun Star Trek starship miniatures games, cheaper than Star Wars X-wing (imo).
The miniatures are as well painted as toys, but a little bit of a wash and drybrushing make them shine (though the latest models look much better).

The Flightpath system is sound. The publisher is extremely inconsistent with ship statistics and play balance, however, and the effective lack of factions in organized play makes fleet lists homogenized and often quite bizarre.

I really enjoy this game for the gameplay. The ship paints are pretty bad. The card art is bad (blurry screen shots from the show...sometimes you can't even tell what it is you're looking at). The original Enterprise model is so tiny you'd think it was a joke. BUT the game is well designed and a lot of fun to play. There are mechanics that make this even more fun than X-Wing Miniatures (which I do also really enjoy). If you are a Star Trek fan, this game gives you an excellent Star Trek tactical combat experience. And Wiz Kids released A TON of models, so you can pick all your favorites from your favorite episodes/movies. They also have large premium figures like Deep Space 9 and Weapon Zero from Enterprise. A must have for trekkies!

I shouldn't have allowed my enjoyment of ST:TNG to blind me to a game that doesn't really have much to it other than 'pew-pew' (it's adorable that it tries to be more, though). I shouldn't seem too ungrateful, however, since Attack Wing also introduced me to what has become one of my least favourite mechanics: combat resolution w/ dice.

Given that most of our gaming is 2p, we found little joy in playing a game where one often wins simply by destroying the other player. 

Rated a '2' not because the gameplay is bad, per se, but only because I will very likely never play the game again.

This is a great game! I love the variety of ships and crew pulled from the various movies, TV shows, and books. The game system is borrowed from X-Wing, but that isn't a bad thing! X-Wing is a good game with a good system, and the core of that system works here. The models aren't as nice as the X-Wing models, but I don't mind that much. 

There are some extra bells and whistles, but overall, they play the same. The differences come with the variety of ships, crew, and upgrades available in this game. There is huge variety, and that is a good thing! Everything is not perfectly balanced, but that is ok. For casual games, it doesn't matter much. The tournament scene I am iffy on. I play, but I don't enjoy it as much as playing with friends. If the same patterns continue to present themselves in the organized play realm, I will hang it up and just play casually. 

I am really enjoying this game and all that it has to offer.

Was a mediocre way to apply the Wings of War engine to the Star Trek universe. Like Armada it leaves a bit to be desired and the cost is high for what you get. 

Standard Star Trek as the scale is inconsistent within their miniatures range. 

Do not care for the fact you can add captains to ships and eras that do not match in the fluff of the game, X Wing is more respectful of that.

The main problem with the game is that the point totals were not lovingly done, so I don't think that it is well suited for highly competitive play.  However, while the models are not as nice as X-wing they are still really nice and it lends itself to a variety of scenarios better than X-wing.  There are also just way more iconic ships.

This game would possibly be a 9 or a 10 but I have to give it a low score because of the insultingly ridiculous quality.

I knew that quality will be bad before I opened my box yesterday but I was not prepared for this bad.

- On Enterprise there are paint spots on one of the warp nacelles where it shouldn't be
- On the Romulan Warbird the mounting is misaligned, it's leaning to the side (looks really cheap this way)
- The cards are bent, the paper stock looks like it's wet and it came out of the washing machine, most pictures are too dark or blurry
- The tokens with images have the same problem, the art on them almost not visible (objective tokens)

This is ridiculous and unacceptable. And I haven't even talked about the original Enterprise... The whole thing is a joke. No, not a joke, an insult...

RATING: 7
decent game, mini's not half as good as x-wing, game is different enough from x-wing to own also, but x-wing is still much better. 
If you're only going casual you probably don't need to buy too many. Here are one or two expansions you could buy.

Klingon's are very straight forward, point at your enemy kind of strategy. The Neg'vhar is a pretty beasty ship with some good Captains. The retail Bird of Prey would also be a good option.

The Romulans require a bit more sneaky and patience but you'll want the Valdore if you're going Romulan. It's the hardest hitting ship, great Captain, great crew. A second expansion is harder to suggest as they're all pretty small and each come with certain things that are useful but depends what you want to do.

Federation take some getting used to but Excelsior is the second best ship to the Enterprise-D. Enterprise has the best crew (IMHO). 

Dominion you'll want the Konorak. It has their best captain, a pretty decent ship with great generic upgrades. After that...they've all different. Breen ship is fun but squishy. Attack ship is the same. It'll depend on what you want to do. Dominion are probably the hardest to play as.

Federation:
Double alpha strike: 2 Big ships around 50 points each. High skill captains so they can shoot first. Intent is to simply eliminate two enemy ships before opponent can fire with them.

Big fish / Little fish: One ship with the bulk of the points and a smaller point ship providing offensive or defensive buffs. It's possible to see this as one big and two small ships.

Romulan:
Rom Strike force: Two ships loaded up around 50 points. Usually with attack cancelling cards like interphase or varel. 

Combined arms approach: Two ships loaded around 40 points each with a small vessel providing buffs nearby. Usually a Vo/Donatra/Flagship type of support vessel.

Swarms: 4+ Small vessels equipped with cards to control the flow of the game. Usually cloaked mines and now probably nuclear warhead equipped builds.

Klingon:
Three lean ships: 3 vessels, 3 captains, and maybe 1 or 2 upgrade cards between the three. 

AWS Strike force build: 2 heavy ships that will never decloak.

4 ship swarm: 4 K'tingas or something similar with the hope of flooding the board with attack dice.

Dominion:
4 Cardassians: A Kraxon with some combination of Galors and Keldons. Just a rolling wave of dice with generic or uper low skill captains

Kraxon bullet shield: Any combination of 2 40ish point ships being escorted by a bare bones Kraxon that is only there to spread damage or mess with opponents targeting priorities.

A rating of 1 sounds harsh but this game started out well balanced and fun and since Andrew Parks left it has become an unbalanced nightmare.

I wish I could give this game a 10.  Until the quality of the components are better, however, it will never be there.  The game itself is great, and if you like X-Wing miniatures game, you'll like Star Trek Attack Wing.  

I will spend some time painting most of these ships again to give them a much better appearance.  It will be interesting to see how fast the expansions will continue to come out because there are already quite a few!  Hopefully as they announce more the game play will not deteriorate with overpowered cards or get you stuck buying multiple copies of one poor expansion just to get the one good card.

I love X-wing.  Thought I would love this, it's the same game after all and it's Star Trek. I do love Star Trek.  
After 5-6 plays more than it deserved though I hate it.

There are numerous reason to hate it.  Shallow ones like the production quality (it's wizkids, all you need to know).  But the game boils down to who can put the sickest combination of crew on your ship to make it unstoppable.  These ships cannot maneuver at all.  taking away almost all that's good about X-wing.
I see no point at all in this game in a universe where Fleet Captains and X-Wing exist.  X-wing is a better game, and Fleet Captains is a much better use of the Star Trek universe.

I rate this a 6, which has drastically dropped from my earlier rating.  At its core, it's a good game, but the costing metric is out of whack and WizKids ruined the game with their competitive OP events.  Locally, since everyone plays in OP events, there is no casual play.  I had fun during the Dominion War OP series and even won a DS9...but haven't played the game since June 2014.  This game is on the chopping block and is hitting my sale pile.

There are a few things that this does better than X-wing. Especially the game's focus on crew interactions, which convey the capital ship combat feel far better than I anticipated. (Wings of War seemed a poor fit for Star trek combat, after all.) As surprising as that was, it still ended up being a bit of a let down in the end. It's the usual Wizkids issues. Ugly and out of scale models, bad paint jobs and terribly over-powered game breaking combos...this is simply a GIANT missed opportunity.

Sort of like Fleet Captains, now that I think about it.

I never got into the whole point-to-point "action" battle systems.  The first attempts looked so arduous, so precise with string, slide rules, and calculators. Recently caught a glimpse of Attack Wing using the movement arcs. It was so streamlined and the "action" pace was vasty improved.  I only wish the base game had the real and only Star Trek crew.

UPDATE: After a few plays we like the game but... Every match so far has ended in a stalemate with both Romulan and Klingon ships ganging up on the Enterprise! No one able to punch through shields and circling the planet. Must be playing wrong.

I like the subtle tweaks to the Flight Path system that Star Trek: Attack Wing makes to that system compared to the X-Wing game (which I also like, just not as much as Star Trek: Attack Wing).  The paint jobs that we all heard horror stories about don't even remotely appear to be anywhere near as big of an issue - if at all - as we were all led to believe by wide-eyed X-Wing fanboys.  These are all very well-painted and excellent-looking ships.  

I was slightly disappointed in the card stock quality but it's hardly the end of the world and I sleeve everything as a matter of habit so no harm there, anyway.  Overall I switched over to Star Trek from X-Wing not out of a greater love for the IP (I enjoy both, immensely) but because the ship-to-ship combat just seems so much better matched for the Star Trek setting than it does in X-Wing.  Star Wars, to me, has always been more about the people and their face-to-face conflicts (both physical and psychological) than the ships' confrontations.  With Star Trek, the characters are naturally a huge part of the series and setting as well but they're much more tied to those beautiful big capital ships zooming majestically through space.  I think that the ST:AW game captures this fantastically AND I was really pleased with the excellent addition of the Mission cards which seem so much better suited for ST:AW than in X-Wing.

Just a phenomenal game all around, despite the hassle of tracking down LE stuff for the OP program, which would be my only complaint about the game, really, other than the slightly chintzy card-stock issue.  Highly recommended.

RATING: 6
Same 'Flight Path' system as X-Wing - so why do I rate this so much lower than X-Wing?  Well...it kinda doesn't FEEL quite as much like 'Star Trek' as X-Wing feels like 'Star Wars'.  A huge part of that may be visual - the mini paint jobs are just flat-out awful, scale all over the place, blatant model errors (that Klingon Battle cruiser bridge facing...LOL!), etc.  But another part is that, in an attempt to fully cash in on their license, WizKids just smashed all the eras and settings together.  You can have Khan flying the Negh'Var alongside close ally Kirk who is commanding a Jem'hadar attack ship with Picard captaining a nearby Ferengi ship as they attack a Federation fleet.  It just...feels so ridiculous, sometimes.  

On top of that, the game balance is just *poor*.  Ship point values have nothing to do with playtesting, they are just a total of all stats...doubled.  Which means two fleets at 100 points may be orders of magnitude different in actual value - it being up to the players to find the combinations that reach that number and 'work'.  The game is absolutely a deck-builder as a primary component, which I've grown tired of over the years (and which is not a problem that has occurred in X-Wing).

So...'X-Wing' is the better game, in the end.  It does take far more money to really get into, though, but it pays off for it, in a way that 'Attack Wing' just...doesn't.

FWIW, with the right group of Trekkies, it CAN still be fun.  It's great seeing scenes and characters you are familiar with (even if they sometimes have in-game abilities with no relation to their on-screen activity), after all.

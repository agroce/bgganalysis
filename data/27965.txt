This is a little gem. Plays fast with easy rules. Excellent topic. If you know the old Japanese Port Arthur movie from 1980 it hits you right on. I was 3 VPs close to Japanese victory. Forget the optional naval combat. It only slows the game down.

The land game presents very interesting choices - at least
to the Japanese player. The MMP naval rules are terrible:
boring, inane, and badly written; guess that's what you
get when it's just an online resource, eh?

Unfortunately, the most interesting decisions that the
Russian player has surround the naval game. I'll be 
trying the original rules for the game, instead of the
MMP version next time.

I have to say, this looks interesting, but it takes a new level of arrogance to sell a product with images of ship counters on the advertising copy, which tells you that players maneuver navies on the board in the copy text, and in which over half the countersheet is dedicated to naval units and markers, and which is about a campaign for which the only famous battle is a naval one (Tsushima) ... and naval rules are not included. The rules point you to the web site, but they aren't there either. At least when Avalon Hill included (and took flak for) bonus counters in Storm Over Arnhem for a mini-expansion for which rules were subsequently included in The General, they didn't advertise the fact on the box.

Anyway, despite the marketing cock-up, it still looks kinda cool, I'm looking forward to giving it a try.

RATING: 7.5
Updated: Rating rises, this is an old-fashioned hex game but in an entirely good way. The Russians are big but slow, they need to block well. The Japanese can turn a sea flank and push up into the mountains but must beware of being weak everywhere. Both sides have a puzzle or two to solve which helps replayability.


Temporary Rating: the main game (not including the Naval Module) looks to be very small but playable. Although the Naval Module adds lots of stuff it may be a distraction from the main action.

Opening actions looking good though I've no idea if my balance of forces will work. Pretty much like the real thing.

It's a game with simple rules, a few units but really challenging. A pleasure to play. In comparison with other games that have rules at a similar level of complexity, I like it for the strategic elements given by the replacement and reinforcement game mechanics (whereas they are missing from other games with similar features).

Nice game, Easily learned and played in an evening.  Lots of options for the Japanese play that will drive the game. Will play again after both players made some wrong headed decisions in the first game.  Would recommend. With a lot of luck on the fleet sorties, the game can swing one way or another.  Rules are short and easy to understand.  Charts on the map are great.  Think the anticipated naval rules will add a whole other game effect.  Good job GMT et al.

Basic, light rules old school hex based wargame.  Played without optional naval rules - after reading naval rules, seemed like too much work with little impact on overall game.

Played once with son (aged 8). He needed to get a little more aggressive with his Japanese cavalry and attack my rail lines - much like the real war!

As I understand the naval combat is not the same as in the Japanese game, and the Japanese version's naval rules are published on the game page here in English for your reading pleasure - they are much better, but I did my masters thesis on the Imperial Japanese Navy during the Russo-Japanese war, so I don't think you'll ever please me.

Continuing in the AVL-type wargames that are simple to play, yet has multiple options players can explore and dynamic gameplay. But also has the AVL problem of being a little too long, and this is the base game. It says 3-5 hours but it's closer to 5 hours. The new naval rules will add unnecessary playing time. Admittedly, the decision for new naval rules was probably due to the diciness of the fleet sorties in the basic rules, with potential for catastrophe for either side.

Solid game on the subject, better accessibility than SPI's old RED SUN RISING game and a bit faster to play.  Some very interesting quirks in the game that take a bit of getting used to (e.g., as the Japanese you want to FAIL to take Nanshan fortress at the outset of the game so you can get your siege artillery sent from Tokyo as soon as possible!).  Naval game is really a lot of tacked on chrome which isn't necessary--a couple of tables handle the Vladivostock and Port Arthur fleet sorties well enough. Biggest challenges for the Japanese; the Russian merely has to parry what he's handed and is usually in reaction mode the whole game.  Very bloody CRT--a couple big battles and everyone is through (shades of WW I!).

Fantastic looking game.  At first I thought that the map was too big, and upon playing I thought that the game was too one-sided, but by the end I needed all of that space and the game turned out to be a nail-biter.  I like how the pace of the game (and geographic focus) shifts throughout play, and the rules are pretty straightforward and interesting.  A time period I'd never paid much attention to, so the game is a welcome addition to my collection.  Rating is based on three plays now, and this is just an all-around excellent game.

excellent little game, fast, fun and short to play (3h usually)
the only real problem is that 70 VP is far too much to grab for the japanese if he does not sunk the fleet early. There should have been a VP count depending of the time when the fleet would have been destroyed. If the fleet is destroyed in turn 8 or 9 60VP is ok, but 70VP is only when the fleet is destroyed in the 5 first turns. After it the russian had plenty of time to gather troops around Lyaoiang

as for the naval rules, they don't add anything except playtime and no much fun. This mean that it is a 100 counter game and that 2/3 of the counter sheet is of ne use

A lovely map, simple but historical naval rules (in the basic game anyway), and an interesting historical challenge.

I think it is a fun game and an enjoyable experience, however, I'm a bit uncertain.

Good: Operational - Russo/Japanese War - Very Easy

Plus:
-Original themeabout a forgotten yet groundbreaking war
-Good components
-Good price, got it for 30 US$
-Simple yet comprehensice system
-Neat chrome like an events table and Colonel Akashi's table; there are 4 tables that trigger events and  influence transport points and this keeps it fresh every time you play
-Good puzzle as the Japanese will have various options in order to get to the 70 VP's
-A great introduction wargame!

Minus:
-The ships are not part of the game with the rules set that comes with the box. Rules can download it from the MMP website but still, big letdown.
-A Japanes suicide run against a fortress can speed up the arrival of the 28 cm mortars (otherwise they only arrive on turn 7) and it seems a bit odd as it invites you do so.
-Balance in favor of the Russians. 
Japanese are really hard pressed. A good role on a Russian fleet sortie early in the game can make the already challenging situation worse for the Japanese player. Since they are already very hard pressed it can be frustrating if this happens.
An intelligent Russian player will usually win imo.

Just in and have played my first 4 games over the weekend. Yes, it is jump and play, which is great.
so far I enjoyed every minute of it, great rules and no questions. The Japanese are hard pressed and I stopped 2 games midway as the Japanes were way to far from achieveng their goal. 

There are various strategies the Japanese can apply and I have yet to find out

So far a great experience and it seems a good value for your bucks.

Update: played 3 more games and still very much like it. Still haven't found a best way although an intelligent Russian player can't afford any misatake.

Update, reduced half a point for replay value. It is a good game but strategies are limited.

Traded.

After reading a really good book on the subject it decided that I really wanted to play this game. 
When MMP put it on their Black Friday sale for only $20.00, I stopped hesitating and ordered it.

Played 1 game solo.
This game has more depth then one assume reading the rules. Supply seems easy, but requires carefull planning and the garrison of strategic places along the mountain passes.
The Japanese really need to push on several fronts to get their cavalry an oppertunity to envelope the strong European russians.
Don't be tempted to pour everything into Port Arthur, cause A) you'll find yourself without supplies & B) it's not that many vp's to score.
Use the early turns to setup a solid base and try to capture the mountains, then open front north and south to exploit the slow russians.

RATING: 5.9
Played at the club twice. The first time, really liked it. Second time, not so much. 

Not a bad very basic intro wargame (all the VERY basic wargame concepts here - takes about 15 minutes to explain, and it's a op/strategic level game that only takes 4 to 5 hours). 

However, one player accepts doing all the attacking and the other all the defending. Think WWII Eastern Front post Kursk. Additionally, there is no political dimension - meaning, the Russian player never has to attack - no infighting - no dirt in the gears of war here. No mandated bonehead attacks. No command or initiative issues (THE major dynamic in the historical conflict). 

Only the most basic combat, movement (no over runs, so 1 guy on a horse blocks thousands) and supply (no logistics planning, just tracing supply) mechanic. And, very OLD school: I get to move ALL my units, perfectly plan my attacks - you watch.

Finally, don't use the optional included naval game included in the box; it doesn't work and is at the wrong scale (vs the land operations). Why was it included? No idea. The naval game is reduced to 3 tables which also need to be modified: Japanese lose the game if the Russians roll high (and significantly reduce or prevent Japanese reinforcements).

Rating should be lower, but, game is on a very neglected topic, is a basic intro wargame, good map (appearance, low counter density, choke points), asks player to make some tradeoffs (how to spend replacement points)...and, we did some have fun playing it. 

See my session report for more detail. 

Surprised that MMP published in the condition it is when it could have been a winner.

A nice introduction to ZOC's and LOS'es and a conflict not often seen in other games. The Tide at Sunrise would get an 8.5 from me (relatively simple system, interesting conflict, beautiful map) but the lack of some very useful components makes my grade go down. There are no chits that would serve as fleet status markers, not enough chits to mark the ownership of railways and no chits to mark the ownership of cities. I know that the game is cheap, but still - shame on you, MMP.

A lower rating then originally planned because MMP couldn't see fit to include the Naval rules/chart in the published package.Thought that slightly tacky of them and then making me having to complete the product.I don't think buyers would have complained spending a couple of more bucks to get the entire full package

Otherwise the Land game is good but must use the differences posted on Consim/BGG from the original Japanese edition and Tide to make it more balanced. Naval rules as written from the website basically stink.I use the Japanese Edition Advance rule or the nice variant posted here.

I think a little more time in development would have helped greatly on some of the issues brought up here and on Consim.

RATING: 4
One of the most loved classic Japanese war games; Adam Starkweather (who brought the great Storm Over Stalingrad to these shores) developing; and Niko Eskubi doin' the art work? Sign me up! I bought the hype and really wanted to like this game. Especially as it promised low counter density and simple mechanics allowing play in an evening.

I'll start off by saying I wasn't disappointed with Niko's graphics (I doubt I ever will be) - 1st rate as always. I wasn't even disappointed that the optional naval rules weren't in the box (but promised as a download). However, there were problems with the gameplay right from the start beginning with the crippling (and incorrect) transport reduction rules and followed by repeated Russian wins that had me questionning how this game could have been such a success in Japan - especially as it seemed they couldn't win! The ruleset either has numerous opaque sections and/or has been poorly translated. Several rules are incorrect or inadequately explained and should have been caught and clarified/corrected in development and playtesting. It is obvious that these efforts were lacking in this case. The basic game mechanics are fine, but the lack of polish has crippled it and made it feel "rushed to market". Sad treatment for a classic. Perhaps the game will eventually be fixed - in the meantime I cannot recommend it. 

In addition, on several ocassions when these problems have been identified by players (including by yours truly) they have been either ignored or treated in a brusk, arrogant tone by the developer. Such reported issues should be investigated; and - if true - should be corrected/clarified in a humble, contrite, apologetic, and thankful manner. Not met with "attitude". 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Challenging, simple, fast-playing low-density game.  Combines a nearly game-length siege with a multi-front mobile dance then ends in a WWI-like head-bash. Outlier fleet rolls and a relatively low amount of combat rolls can throw the game, but the fast playtime -may- excuse it.  There's a bit of the old min/max CRT game going on here, but the focus is on battle pacing, force composition, and force distribution.  It features collapsing fronts, feints, delay tactics, momentum, and attrition warfare.  

I would have preferred numerous counters for tracking important game information instead of naval counters.  An excellent VASSAL module supported by the publisher makes for easy PBeM play.

As with all translated imports, I will never know if I am playing the game the original designer intended.  Wargame rules are often about careful readings and subtle distinctions...what may have been incorrectly translated?  And what did the developer decide to change/add?   That said, we've had no misgivings about this game thus far.

Note: others' comments regarding problems in achieving a Japanese victory were likely due to plays of the game soon after production, using the rules as published without the correction to the permanence of transportation losses.

Liked this a lot when first played.    Have since had it explained to me by experienced players in a fashion that seems to indicate that this is a "classic" (as in "AH Classic") game: perfect information, deterministic victory conditions, and as a result a degree of victory point optimisation that the historical sides simply did not have.  Supposedly the ideal strategy is to take Port Arthur with as few troops as possible so it falls exactly for the historical game end.  Afrika Korps in the Far East?

I still like the rather attritional CRT and thought this the best of the RJW games I've seen.  But it seems as if this is mostly damning by faint praise. 

Fantastic map. Love it.

Rules translation seems sloppy, makes one wonder if unnecessary changes were made to the original game. Naval units are a waste, would have preferred more markers for the base game.
I dislike Eskubi's graphics, he's the anti-Simonsen. His reprints are always a step down in clarity and usability from the originals. I will try and pick up a Japanese edition.

RATING: 8
Played once, solo. Very interesting. The terrain and the amphibious landings make things interesting, and I like the decisions of how to use the Replacement Points. Nice components with good periodic feel. There should have ben counters for tracking when the Russian fleets may sail. Seems like an obvious thing. You can supply your own, of course. Counters for Japanese control of ports would have been useful, too.

Rulebook is good, though a couple of clarifications were needed. E.g, all partial land hexes are playable. The game was easy to learn, even with some special rules. I didn´t try the optional naval rules. The naval counters, illustrated on the back of the box, with no rules for them, is of course a huge embarrassment for a major publisher.

Seems hard for the Japanese to reach 70 VP, but I´ve only played once. The Russian role is more reactive, but it´s not without decisions: how to use replacement points, where to send reinforcements, where to counterattack etc. Works well solo.

Great game. Works well solo and face to face. The low counter density and simple rules mean it is likely to get a lot of plays.
 Seems very well balanced from the 3 games I've played so far.Port Arthur is bound to fall so not necessary to feed so many troops in ( four divisions and a 280mm if you are lucky ?) and with aggressive Japanese play , the Russian army is hard pressed to hold ground and keep casualties low.

RATING: N/A
Playtesting....The thing I enjoy with Tide at Sunrise is how different the two sides are and play. The Japanese are trying to rush in and beat the clock to achieve their objectives. The Russians are trying to hold on and wait as their European reinforcements come in. Port Arthur is likely to fall at some point in the game, so a goal for the Russians is to make it a pyrrhic victory for the Japanese so that they have a hard time accomplishing their other goals. Another nice thing - both players have just a pool of reinforcements and purchase new units each turn. The Japanese start with a high purchase ability that declines. The Russians start low but increase as the game continues. What you buy and when adds the ability to try to vary your tactics. So this game certainly does have low unit density, as well as only a few units types per side as well. (Think artillery, cavalry, infantry - with perhaps a couple units types of each, for example, field artillery, siege artillery for the Japanese. Base infantry and the more powerful European infantry divisions for the Russians, etc.) 

High level stuff - some units are single step, while others are two step. Most combat results tend to be retreats with step losses (or elims) only at the higher odds. Attacker can be hurt at barely postive odds (1:1, 2:1). Units have ZOCs, so key is surrounding units forcing them to take losses or be eliminated if they can't retreat. (This will all sound AVL-ish I'm sure.) System is pure igo-ugo, no chit pull. As a result, it lends itself very well to PBEM as one side makes all their moves w/ combat results. (Most retreats are pretty obvious).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Once you find out how you should really be dealing with transport losses (i.e. not as written in the rules), this is a fun, tight game which creates interesting puzzles for both players. The Russian player will rarely attack, so it is perhaps a little more interesting for the Japanese, but nevertheless it is still fun trying to work out the best lines of defence. It plays very well solo. Despite my admiration for Tide, it does remind me that I'm not a fan of hex and counter games--but due to this game's low counter density and simplicity, I'm willing to overlook my slight aversion in this case.

On the downside, there are still a few too many rules queries open. In the basic game, the naval side is a crap shoot, but can have a massive impact on the course of the game and the chances of either side winning. 

I haven't tried the "bonus" naval game yet: I'm worried it might just be a complicated distraction to a game that shines on account of its simplicity; however, it might deal with my worries about the diceyness of the basic naval rules.

Extreme sortie rolls can really cripple a side, especially the Japanese.

Fun and easy wargame that plays in less than 3 hours. I have not played the optional Naval rules and will probably not bother since I thought the rules as is worked just fine.
-Positives: I liked the two front tactical situation and the choices players had to make in regards to how much force should be sent to Port Arthur and what should be dedicated to capturing/holding the rail line. I thought the game was balanced, my game ended in a close Russian victory which was in doubt up to the final dice roll.I thought the chrome was just right. It added enough flavor without adding to the complexity.

--Negative: Not a big deal now but could see replayability taking a hit after a few games once you get enough experience to figure out optimal strategy for both sides. I could also understand someone's frustation opening the box and seeing all the nice ship counters and then realizing it is primarily a land warfare game but this is a non-issue with me.

Really like it as a game, but as a simulation it feels like a late 70 s SPI game.

A good little game. Rules are simple and both players have many things to deal with. Japanese army is fast and strikes hard but the russian bear can still give deadly blows. The game can be ended in one sitting, I think it's worth the look for anyone interested in the topic.

Old school wargaming system applied to an interesting situation, low number of counters and low complexity. Pretty map.

Devoting half the counter sheet to naval units that are only used in optional, internet-published rules is a serious flaw by the game developer.

I love this game, 1 minute set up, good replay, interesting choices for a one evening wargame.
The optional naval rules are unrealistic, not fun and not in the tone of the land rules... Better play with the Japanese version. With both land and naval optional rules version for a perfect balance.

Another game that shows how flexible the SCS mechanics are applying both to early 20th century conflicts as well as late 20th century ones.  There's not a lot on the ground war aspects of the Russo-Sino conflict and this one does a good job of throwing the players together on land while not ignoring the naval play that was predominant in that conflict.

Great operational/strategic wargame on the Russo-Japanese War.  The Russian actually stand a chance to win, with some luck and grit defending those mountain passes!

For a simple game, this was pretty good.  The terrain, forts, and navel battles add several interesting aspects to the game.  Sides seemed pretty evenly matched.

Lovely graphics, but the game is so unbalanced (in favour of the side that lost the actual war) that I suspect the rules were mistranslated. 

Underdeveloped, under tested, under supported. 

I gave my copy away.

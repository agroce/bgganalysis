RATING: 6.5
Route-planning masterpiece (National Geographic edition).

The goal is to reach destinations all over the world, more specifically the ones you have in your hand (cards) and the cards laid face-up on the table.  To do this, you start or continue up to 3 different expeditions, by means of placing an arrow tip-to-tail (like a vector).  All you get to do on your turn is place an arrow, once, BUT you also can place arrows that land on spaces that give you the always welcome extra action (ticket) or the space that gives you an extra arrow placement.  Also, if you form a loop, you get to place another arrow anywhere on that expedition.

So it turns out that you can actually string several combos together in one turn.  Getting back to the extra actions, these are generally used to place an extra arrow, but they can also be used to remove an arrow, or trade a card from your hand.  There is a very enjoyable co-operative competitive aspect to the expeditions, as others may change the direction you wanted to go, but they might also inadvertantly go where you wanted to go on another expedition, saving you the hassle.

Points are scored for every completed location visit (card), whether in your hand or one you completed from the face-up draw pile, and also for your special regions, which are little dots you place in enclosed regions on the map.  You want to focus on acquiring your dots (they're worth 2 points instead of one for cards), and the cards in your hand (they're minus one point for each you have left over).

This is a very subtle strategy game that plays 2-5, but seems to work exceptionally well for 2-3 players.  It's a very accessible game that has easy gameplay but also requires some decent strategy.  A very overlooked title.

Love the wildlife adventure components, but the rules here are just straight up better.  Its essentially a connection abstract here.

TransAmerica/Europa might be a better take at this shared network idea, but the combos possible here are excellent.

A simple, entry-level route game that I think would work well with non-gamers. The advanced game is the way to go here, otherwise things seem a bit too easy. I think that this is one of the few games that might work best with a full compliment of 6 players, although I have not tried it with more than 4.

Good game of path-building.  Race to tag all of your animals & archeologic sites.  The game is even better with the doubling chips... where you reveal some of the locations that you must reach (success = double points, failure = negative points).  I have always played with the following house rules -- (1) when a circle is formed, you must break it (with a free extra arrow placement) and (2) you place two arrows per turn instead of just one arrow.  ** UPDATE ** It might be too easy to traverse the oceans (provided you have a ticket or two that you can spend).

January 2017 first play:

WAAAAAAAY too long for what it is. 

Lay down an arrow in the direction you need it and wait for your opponents to inevitably screw you over by changing it to the direction that your opponent needs.

A three player adult game clocked well north of two hours. That is ridiculous by 2017 standards when there are so many heavy meaty games that clock less than that. Playing this with kids to teach them geography for 30 minutes would be okay. But at 135 minutes, it just doesn't fit in modern gaming.

RATING: 8
Once you get the hang of it, this is a quick (our two player games take about thirty minutes) light game for two players where most of your decisions are fairly obvious, but you do get some opportunities for clever or explosive play (to note, I play with the Ravensburger rules, I'm not sure if this is true with other rule sets).

The conflict is parasitic in nature, so playing well involves setting up your opponent to help you out, and taking opportunities to play keep away with their interests.

The game does break down if someone runs out of tickets and still has their markers on the board in the end game, because odds are they will never see another ticket and will never collect their marker, basically handing victory to the other player.

The most interesting aspect of the game is the shared expeditions, because you don't have final say in the expedition  route and must adapt to what the other player is doing, and try to encourage the other player to choose to go where you also want to go.

The biggest flaw to the game is that the decisions are rather shallow once you get a hang of them. Mostly just a question of whether you accept getting blunted on your decision space (and ninety nine times out of a hundred the answer is yes).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
An extremely annoying game which will be won by those who revel in solving tedious solo puzzles. The expeditions routes are quite crazy with endless loops and reversals being rewarded and then there's the memory aspect of which I am not a fan. The map is also quite poor (at least in the 1st edition) with many places completely misplaced (see South Dakoto for example). Too abstract and too much downtime to be any fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This was sold to me as Trans America on Steroids. It features the same shared route technology but varies conisderably after that. There are plenty of cities which provide extra turns and on each turn a player can play half a dozen routes to reach some of their point cities. It includes open cities, which can be claimed by any player. 

My single play was bogged down by an AP prone player but I think as a light hearted experience this would be quick and easy. Still only a seven for me because of all the extra turns which feel a little gimicky and overdone.

RATING: 6
Fast paced connection game by Herr Kramer with a very nice look. The game presents you with a limited number of objectives, which seem quite easy to fulfill, but the other players never seem to be willing to go where you need them to which creates a constant tension as you try to keep them from knowing where you want to go and subtly direct the expedition teams in a given direction. Of course, sometimes brute force becomes neccessary, hence the extra action chit mechanism and spots on the board that hand out extra arrows. A little too basic to rate extremely highly for me, but an enjoyable and short game that I would have no problem playing on occasion.

Expedition has never let me down, I don't know why I don't suggest it more often.  I love cooperative competition and this game has one of the better mechanisms for it.

The weak theme and ugly board detracts from replays.  UPGRADE.

This is another simple but challenging German game. This one is absolutely wonderful. Three expeditions, controlled by all the players, take you around the world. You have to get the expeditions to the sites corresponding to the cards in your hand. During your turn you try to direct one of the expeditions where you need it to go--and of course during the other players turns they are going to send the expeditions elsewhere. This is a great blocking game that is simple enough for preteens but will keep the hardened gamer thinking. This was my first Wolfgang Kramer game and it made me a fan. Tikal, Magalon and El Caballero have not disappointed me either but this I feel is his best. Can't wait to try Viva Pamplona next.

Expedition is a really simple game, rules-wise. On your turn, you just add another step to one of three shared expeditions on the board, in an effort to reach a number of secret (or optionally revealed but more valuable) sites on the world map. There are a couple of special rules, and they are quite important at that, but nevertheless that's the gist of the game. Obviously, with increasing player numbers any single player's input becomes rather subdued but with a smaller number it becomes a delightful wrestle to get the expeditions to move where you want them.

Great game that is somewhat overlooked; works as light family fare or as a skillful endeavor for weathered gamers.  It becomes very chaotic with more than 2 or 3 players, though.  I highly recommend the optional rule that requires a player to restart an expedition from the loop itself (rather than any point in the expedition).  I'm happy to play with or without the disclosed destinations at the start of the game, but currently lean toward leaving all destinations concealed (other than the public ones, of course).

Meh.  It has some okay mechanics, but it combines "randomly screwed by other players" and "you have to remember all of your cards and all of the cards on the board" aspects, both of which I abhor.  Some randomness can be mitigated by clever planning.  Unfortunately, even with all that, it's a game that can lend itself to TERRIBLE overanalysis given the wrong endgame situation and players.

I found the whole mechanic of looking for a loop/green dot/red dot to be very chaotic and a bit frustrating while you waited for some person to exploit this broken feature to it&#039;s fullest. I&#039;ve only played one game, and one player had a single turn that lasted 10 minutes in which he laid about 20 arrows.. he was quite enamoured with the play, but the rest of us were left just scratching our heads. 

This happened a couple of more times, so it wasn&#039;t limited to a single fluke situation.  I too liked the theme and the artwork.. but not enough to play this one again.

RATING: 7
I enjoy this game with 3 or 4. With 5 or 6 things get out of control and your strategy is out the window. But with the right number this game is fantastic. There are enough choices to bring this game to the right tension factor. I have the English version of the National Geographic Edition of this game. I like it and am happy to have it, but the price needs to go down to make it a recommendation for others. There are a lot of games out there that offer as much, or more, at a better value.

RATING: 7
This is quite a good med/light route planning game for 2 to 3 players with secret missions to accomplish. Sometimes your working towards the same area as an opponent almost working together and other times they will redirect the expedition away from where you want. There are a couple of ways to counteract the later via extra actions and loops but if it gets too far away it can get difficult ensuring some tension, also there are only three expeditions also making things difficult. 

You need to maximize your movements and extra actions utilizing the 'bonus' spots on the board while trying to be first to win some face-up destinations. Some luck in the card distribution, a hint of strategy with planning & executing and good tactics make a fun little fast playing game. On a side note the board has a lot of neat destinations with good little pictures on it and so do the cards albeit seeing the spots on the board is a tad difficult.

Simple, luck-based but looking at its roots from 1985 ([gameid=156]) or even 1974 ([gameid=23046]), it's still worth playing Expedition although rather at the lower player count than at the upper one. An unlucky draw of destination cards can screw a player. Scores tend to be close with one or two successful manoeuvres to detour an expedition from opponents' destinations to own ones deciding.

Three expeditons move around the board visiting different cities. Players try to make sure the expeditions reach the cities they are holding. There are also some common expeditions. Game ends when all personal expeditions of one player are reached or you run out of arrows.

Loops can be a bit confusing...

Scores will be close.

I have the new "National Geographic Expedition" (ENGLISH edition with english text cards).  One of the good games with a travel theme.  This Kramer game has card mgt., route planning and some risky token placement decisions involved, revises Wildlife Adventure (no more chance cards).  I've played Wildlife Adv and think Expedition is a significant improvement of the older Wildlife Adv system (especially with the looping rules).  But playing with 6 players increases downtime a lot.

We played this with friends and enjoyed ourselves. The twisty-turny nature of the "expeditions" was fun and interesting. I loved the way that the expeditions developed over the course of the game - it really kept you guessing. We played with 5 people, which was definitely too many - it just took too long for the turn to come back around to you. It was also a bit of a hassle to continually have to check your own cards to see if anyone landed in those cities. Perhaps I would rate it higher if I enjoyed geography, but that is not the case. Overall, I can't see really wanting to play it again, although I would with the right company.

If you like traveling this highly tactical game is for you. As a player you can extend on 3 expeditions over the world, and your goal is to make these expeditions pass the countries that you have drawn in the beginning of the game.

Three plays so far and I like it alright -- we're still getting to know the board, which I think is slowing us down considerably.  So many destinations to keep in mind that it's a little tiring.  I know that we'll instinctively know where the locations are with a few more playings.  I'm excited to try the "no cards" variant -- with all destinations exposed.  That sounds much better to me.  Right now we're playing the basic game and it's a little like TransAmerica with a few "up for grabs" stations.

Easy explainable game. Get rid of your cards by going past their location on the map with one of the 3 expeditions. Some screwage possible. Fun way to learn some geographical sites on the side.

Plays fine with 2. Might be a bit too long, but that's solvable by house rules (take less cards to begin with)

Another fun game to play with 3 players. With 3 expeditions in 3 colors, things worked out great. The designers choose to use player colors the same as the colors used on the board. So we played with white, black and blue player colors so as not to confuse things with the red and the green dots on the game board. It is a shame the cards are not in english as well. My bet is that there was a lot of interesting information about each of the sites on the cards. The bits and pieces seem pretty cheap. The cards are thin and easily bent or dog eared and the round chips are as cheap as they come. This one could have earned and 8 if not for these bad spots.

RATING: 6
This one's never really hit the mark for me. There's some cool things you can do with loops and the like, but in the main you get lucky in that people go where your destinations are ... or you don't.

Most of the charm of the game are finding clever expedition moves to weave it your way. Whether expeditions will accidently trigger another player’s goal and score points for them is a lottery ... and one of the reasons I guess I don’t understand why it’s considered an old-time favourite. Sure you can drive expeditions down already taken routes, or through the oceans ... but if you need to get inland, there’s not that much more you can do to avoid other people getting accidental scores.

Tipped off by Wildlife Adventure having high recognition in Sumo, the upgraded version Expedition has been a firm family favourite since the late 90's and still holding up well. 

Essentially a going-out card game via interesting route planning play by connecting to the location held in the hand. This is my wife's all time favourite board game, and I can understand why as there are tactical things to consider as to managing tickets which allow an additional action as well as spots on the board to either pick up another ticket or place another connection on the board. Add to this that looping expeditions can then branch off creates some dramatic card discarding or frustrating (but fun) diversions away from player's destinations. 

Personally I prefer the more streamlined TransAmerica as the scoring is slicker and the connections are cooperative, whereas in Expedition the lack of control isn't much of an issue as you should be able to problem solve yourself out of the situation, but the use of "important" destinations marked with tokens not only increases the strategy but the diversions seem maliciously intentional.

Similar in play to Trans America but with more 'meat'.  Easy to teach anyone. Note: to speed up play with new players, explain that the color of the cards matches the continents and then find their 'digs' by picture.  The German is for flavor and does not affect play.

I described this 15-year-old Kramer as 'Transamerica on steroids'. Like Transamerica, players have a hand of locations to visit, and take turns to add to a shared network. But there's loads more going on in Expedition: three point-to-point 'expeditions' instead of a single network; face-up location cards that can be claimed by anyone; tokens that you can spend on special actions; the possibility of upping the stakes on some of your locations by revealing them to everyone; and an ingenious mechanic for dealing with loops in an expedition.

The board is visually jarring, and could be implemented in a more user-friendly way.  (Remove pictures from the board, and leave them on the cards for flavor.  Number each continent's dots from top to bottom, and place corresponding numbers on the cards as corner indexes.)  I believe such a simple change would result in this game achieving the popularity it deserves.

We misplayed a rule during our first play.  The correct way to play is that when the removal of an arrow makes the expedition end in a loop, play as if the loop had just been created (i.e. place an arrow on this expedition.).

Queens Game version. This is an early connection game that I think inspired Alan Moon's style of connection games (yes, I know that Wildlife adventure precedes this). There's the randomness of the card draw, the frustration of having a connection veer away from your intended destinations and alot of good powerful plays if you can 'see' it on the board. Keep those tickets for later in the game. Tend to think that the green 'free' turns and red ticket dots can be overly powerful. But they help quicken the pace of the game.

We misread the rules for this a bit, so we ended up in a stalemate.  Would be worth trying again properly as it seems like quite a neat game.

I really dig the cooperative route &quot;planning&quot;.  The occassional endless turn is somehow impressive and off-putting at the same time.  This game desparately needs an English language version.  Arrowed!!!

Very similar to the original Wildlife Adventure game.  The fact that a few of your "must visit" locations are announced makes the game different, but not enough that I feel like I need to own both games.  If you have travel tickets/vouchers available, the oceans can be traversed very rapidly in this version... leading to a good amount of chaos in the expeditions.

I feel about Expedition much the way I feel about Carcassonne. Of course, the games do not really invite a comparison! So no more about Carc.

In Expedition, players are trying to guide three different geographical expeditions so that they pass through particular locations (which match the cards held by the players). So, on your turn, you place a single arrow, in one of three colors, leading from one location to another. If you (or another player) hits a location matching a card in your hand, you get to play the card down. Play them all down, and the game ends. There are special blue locations which earn you an extra turn, and special red locations which earn you Expedition Tickets. The tickets can be redeemed to place another arrow, or remove the most recent arrow, on any expedition. Each player begins the game with three of these tickets. Each player also uses four tokens on the map to indicate a subset of his/her locations. These tokens add a strategic element, as you want to prevent expeditions from passing through opponents' tokens.

Expedition strikes me as a lightish family game, kind of like Carcassonne (oops, didn't really mean to mention it). There is a nice blend of luck (card draw) and skill. I have the National Geographic edition, which is very attractive and the cards are interesting and informative. Place names are all in the native languages, as much as possible. There are no Chinese characters, and a western alphabet is used for all place names - but the game has a very global feel. Expedition is one of those games I can't help thinking should be part of the average American family's game collection. Maybe then, more than 1 out of 4 Americans could find Iraq on a map.

Expedition is best played with 2-4 people, even though up to 6 can play. With 5 and 6, the game just takes too long, and there is too much downtime. But with 2-4, the timing is tighter, and it's   a very enjoyable experience.

I guess this is actually my first Wolfgang Kramer game with the exception of a single live play of 6 Nimmit!  This is a neat little global racing game.  I guess the three moveable markers are supposed to represent airplanes.  It reminded me a bit of Elfenland or some type of train game.  I can't think of anything really bad about the game, although there is a luck factor to this one.  The game probably plays well with families and non-gamers.

Don't forget about the public sites as they are worth the same as private sites. Also watch when the last color arrow is used up . For public sites, we use an unused chip color, and it makes it much easier to find them than to look at the cards......overall a real good game for three.

Seems simple at first, but there are lots of tricky ways to get the expedition to head towards your locations.  Better than the sum of its parts.  Around the world in eighty minutes.

Perhaps the best of the travel games (those where you have to visit a certain list of places).  The manipulation of the joint expeditions makes for an excellent mechanism, adding many subtleties to what is usually a fairly straightforward genre.

Played this 2-player after previously only playing Wildlife Adventure, which I don't remember enjoying very much. This, however, was fun! Fun challenge trying to figure out how to create loops, and how to most efficiently get and use the extra tickets.

--- Rules ---
Players get 8 or 12 cards (for 4+ or 2-3 players) to start. Also, 6 cards are placed face up = public destinations. Then, each reveals 4 of them (in switchback order), placing tokens on the locations. 

On your turn, move an expedition (3 colors on board; location = arrowhead) by placing similar color arrow. May expend a ticket (2/turn) to take another action. If expedition ends up on a red spot, take a ticket from supply; if on blue, get another action; if create loop, take another action and may leave from any location on the loop. If you move an expedition to a public location, place the card in front of you (and draw a new public card). If an expedition ever moves to a location on one of your cards (on any player's turn), place the card in front of you. If the expedition makes it to one of your revealed locations, play the card and collect the token.

The game ends when any player plays their last card, or when all 3 destinations can no longer move. Players earn 1VP per card played and token collected; lose 1VP per card in hand. Most VP wins.

Sort of like Transamerica but I prefer this. Lots of combo possibilities and tactical ploys

And enjoyable with 2 players as well as 4

Better with the variant where you can only branch off the Loop just created

This game features an intersting idea.  Players build on 3 simultaneous expeditions that are moving all over the planet to visit sites associated with famous archeological treasures.  No player owns any of the expeditions, so you are free to advance any expedition you want on your turn.  I like that aspect of the game and the game board is nice to look at.  The part I don't like is the too heavy luck factor.  You don't know which locations your opponents have in their hands, so you can easily accidentally give your opponents points as you move an expedition to your own goal sites.  In the 3 player game each player gets a lot of location cards, so it becomes very easy to accidentally give your opponents points.  Other than the luck issue, however, I do like the game.  The rules are simple and the play time of about 40 minutes feels just right.

At first blush, Expedition looks like a children's route-building game. However, Expedtion may represent the designer's most elegant rule set ever.  Coupled with the carefully composed map, a player of any skill level will inevitably stumble into the deliciously addictive combos and spend the rest of their game chasing them. If I could reprint just one game, this would be it. It's also the perfect family game.

I love to travel so this game's theme is very interesting to me.

I also love that it scales so well from 2-6 players.

I own the German-language version, but I don't read German.  I wish I had the English version, but it is difficult to find.  Being able to read the cards would make the game a bit more interesting.

I suspect my rating will change with more plays, but I am not sure which way it will go.

Update: Goes from 7 to 7.5.  Its just set collecting and route building, but I enjoy stealing routes and trying to make loops.  It does not create a story exactly, but kind of. It at least creates enough of one that players speak of their plays in non-abstract terms. Best of all I love the pace and flow of the game. like Jambo and La Citta I am engaged, but relaxed. The decisions are meaningful and there can be angst when the route moves in an unwanted way, but mostly I feel at peace with this one.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 5
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 4


Overall - 1

There are certainly shades of Ticket to Ride in this game with the building of "tracks". However, the similarities end right there. The initial setup can be quite confusing with the plethora of colors on the board. However, once the game progresses, things get a lot easier and clearer. The game is simple and relatively straight forward, but the winner of the game seems rather predictable and since all the points are not hidden, it was rather anti-climatic. The last few rounds felt pre-determined and scripted with a few players giving up completely since victory was unattainable. Mixed feelings on this game. Love and hate the simplicity at the same time. Lacks tension.

Eh.  I can see why it was a big game when it first came out, but I can also see the improvements made on gaming in general that make this just barely so-so.  I also don't like racing games, so that probably sours my perception of the game, too.  I might be willing to try it with fewer players to reduce the chaos of the game, but I don't see myself asking to play this that often.

This one sounded good during rules explanation: a reasonable simple game of routeplanning, like TransAmerica with a bit more going on.

However, during actual gameplay it became obvious that the game isn't really about strategically planning the routes for the long term. Instead, each turn detoriates into a little puzzle with the goal of finding the most broken move with a combination of green dots, red dots and loops.

A lot of Kramer's design are tactical in nature rather than strategic. Sometimes it all comes together very nicely (PoF, Maharaja), sometimes I find his games a bit too puzzle-y for my tastes (Goldland). Unfortunately, Expedition falls in the latter category.

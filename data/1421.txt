The excellent Nova mechanic applied to simple battles in wonderful books. They were a little out of my price range to collect many when they were published, they predate the collectible card game phenomenon some but are in that genre. Having said that, each character adds a certain flavour. Good fun, excellent design.

I had about ten different books of these in the years after college and they saw pretty heavy play with roommates and friends for a few years. We found them to be good, but they eventually saw less and less play as we became able to predict how things would happen. Also, the later books suffered from lowered quality of artwork, which also made buying new books less interesting. I sold these in a fit of closet-cleaning prior to a move.

RATING: 7
Excellent man-to-man system. Some of the books are really buggy, though, and the modern "innovations" of collectable gimmick cards stink. Stick with the basics.

I played this as a kid. It's a clever idea for a game, but I'm not sure it worked all that well in execution. It was alright for a quick play back then, but it's no longer my cup o' tea.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Was a fun game back in the 80â€™s, especially if you were into fantasy games like D&D.  But it had little longevity since most of the characters fight somewhat similarly, with much of the same number combinations.  Certain moves were almost always bad and were almost never picked.  Characters like the Dwarf, which had very few options, were not very fun to play.  Come to think of it, the buying of character books in this game back then reminds me a bit of the later buying of cards for Magic: the Gathering in the 90â€™s.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Good.  I had a lot of fun with these in high school.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This is a great game with lots of replay value.  There are quite a number of characters so there is a huge variety in the combats you can set up. While there is a pretty good tactical component there is also a large psychological component in figuring out your opponent's style of play so that you can zig when he zags. An easy game to handicap and to set up for tournanment play. There are also cards with spells, weapons and tactics for even more tactical depth and variety.   
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
you each have a book showing your character which you give to your opponent. Each turn you both choose a manouevre (restricted by what's happened the turn before) like lunge, jump, block etc. These are then cross referenced to find a result which could be a wound, knocked off balance, drop your weapon or the dreaded "behind you!". More advanced books include magic and special items - we haven't played with these rules yet. It's interesting that each character does have its own characteristics and ways of playing, learning these is part of the fun.

RATING: 6
Classic sword and sorcery combat game based on selecting simultaneous actions and seeing how the situation plays out in conjunction with you current situation and your opponents action.  Does this with a pair of books, one for each player.  You take the opponents book and see how the 1/1 battle is progressing based on what you see from your POV in the opponents situation.   Similar to Ace of Aces if you are familiar with mechanisms from that game.

These little gamebooks provide for 2-player games that are easy to learn, quick to play, and absolutely charming. There's nothing especially brilliant about the artwork, but one nonetheless stands in awe of the way in which Leonardi was able to imagine the flow of combat, and to translate it into a bunch of still images and huge lists of multiply compatible cross-references. Each contest is just as full of tension and tactical experimentation as any well-designed video game.

I have all of the Nova books published in 1984 (1-12)

Excellent warmup/filler game that could be used for a gladiatorial tournament. No luck involved. Out-think your opponent. Combatants are unbalanced, but it is never rock/paper/scissors, and underdogs can win by thinking creatively.

Excellent cross-referencing system among books; excellent (and original) initiative system, which will be invisible to most beginners. The key to winning is seizing the initiative and then pressing at the key moment. Simple and straightforward rules, but experienced players will defeat beginners time and again, irrespective of matchup.

This game is far ahead of its time, and stands up even in 2012. The only real downsides are the quality of illustration in the books and some inherent limitations if you only have a few (particularly if these are the less tactically versatile types, like the ax-wielding dwarf). 

Odd-numbered match ups (3v2; 2v1) are poorly handled.

3.) too easy to turn to wrong page, messing up entire flow of game
4.) no sense of identification, darn it!  You like the skeleton, you buy the skeleton book, practice all the skeleton strategies...then hand the book over to your opponent and never get to see your own darn character!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Play can sometimes slow down over complicated rules,
you need to buy a book for each new character type and
the price of books has shot up dramatically over the
years.
Still, fun to bust out every once in a while...

RATING: 5.8
I give this game a little boost because it was a novel concept and should be really spiffy.  That said, it was a bit cumbersome to play and not always intuitive (like how to realize if you're still at extended range when the phrase you are to say to your opponent does not mention it).  Also, how is one with 7 body points supposed to beat one with 35?  Seems mighty unbalanced--and this was playing with some of the early booklets, when it was supposedly well-playtested.

Have several of the Nova characters.  I've never really understood the strategy of the game, many of the results seem fairly random.

I went to the Flying Buffalo website and copied the errata into my books.  NOW the fights make more sense, some of my books had typos in them.  The books WITH the errata are now worth a 6.

RATING: 4
Interesting first few plays as it (to my young mind when they were first released) combined the booklet driven system of Ace of Aces with fantasy combat of the Wizard/Melee Microgames.  Managed to collect quite a few books but they just ended up sitting on the shelf over time and weren't really played.  And the artwork seemed to simpler or cruder as the books were churned out.  And for some reason, lots of books didn't necessarily result in lots of variety.  Rating mostly for nostalgia, but really have no interest in this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This is one of my favorites.  My rating is based mainly on the original set of books published by Nova Games.  The more recent publications have pushed the power level to where the original characters are no longer competitive.  I would rate the game a little lower (7-ish) if I included those books (although I only have a few of them).  

Update 1/2011:  I'm getting used to some of the newer books, but it still bugs me that they obsoleted a few of the old characters.  Significant balance problems in the game prevent it from being a 10, but it is still one of my favorites.

I rate this an 8 for the older books, as they seem to play better and are more balanced than the newer ones.  I'd probably rate the newer ones a 5.5, 6 on a good day.  A few of the older books, however, are ridiculously overpowered (i.e., the Cold Drake).  Other than that, it's a blast to play and simple enough that my son can grab a book and beat the hell outta ol' Dad.

[thing=1421]Lost Worlds[/thing] is one of my all-time favorite games. It is a game of dueling fantasy characters. Each player picks a book, takes the corresponding character sheet, and hands his books to his opponent. This way you actually see your opponent's each and every move in your back and forth duel.

We would use [thing=1421]Lost Worlds[/thing] as a filler during years of long roleplaying sessions, and sometimes we scheduled full tournaments or just played duels for hours on end. I have a big collection of books, and both of the board games released in the series.

My collection breaks down as follows:

# Nova
1x 1001 Man in Chainmail with Sword and Shield
2x 1002 Skeleton with Scimitar and Shield
1x 1003 Dwarf in Chainmail with Two-handed Ax
2x 1004 Giant Goblin with Mace and Shield
1x 1005 Woman in Scale with Sword and Shield
1x 1006 Hill Troll with Club
1x 1007 Barbarian with Two-handed Sword
1x 1008 Fighter Mage with Magic Sword
2x 1009 Wraith with Sickle
1x 1010 Cold Drake
1x 1011 Halfling with Sword and Shield
2x 1012 Lizard Man with Scimitar and Buckler
1x 1013 Man in Plate with Sword and Shield
3x 1014 Man with Short Sword and Dagger
3x 1015 Woman with Quarterstaff
1x 1016 Winged Gargoyle with Scimitar
2x 1401 Samurai with Katana
2x 1402 Ninja with Ninjato
1x 1601 Manticore

# Chessex
1x 60150 "Othere" Djinn of Distinction
1x 60151 "Brimstone" the Fire Giant
1x 60152 "Sir Percival" Mounted Knight
1x 60153 "Cimeree" Elfin Maid

# Flying Buffalo
1x 8601 "Umslopagaas" the Scorpion Wizard
1x 8602 "Flaming Cherry" Barbarian Beauty
1x 8604 "Chiron" Magical Centaur
1x 8607 "MacAber" A Highland Warrior with Claymore

I also own Nova's Tome of Red Magic, Ninja Gimmicks (1411), and a whole bunch of gear, magic items, spells, and other cards from both Nova and Flying Buffalo, as well as both board games; [thing=3969][/thing] and [thing=7113][/thing]. I also have the wild west [thing=3089][/thing], [thing=5733][/thing] and [thing=3152][/thing].

The best "play in the car" game ever.  A personal favorite.

RATING: 6
There are aspects of the game that are poorly explained in some editions of the rules, such as why characters have a Luck rating and an Attacks rating.  (Thankfully kilrah explained those succinctly to me!)  Nonetheless, it's a pretty interesting system, and a fun way to spend a little time.  The artwork for the drawn books ranges from nice to bleah, and the photographed books are decently "directed" (but with a failure to evoke even a semblance of proper emotion in the shots I've seen); however, the photos tend to have nice special effects (e.g. a physical axe "flying" toward the camera).

Great fun! I generally like games with different ways to win, and in this one it really opens up for strategic variation.

The drafting is tense, especially with the possibility of building wonders that grant you another pick before the opponent.

Expecting this to keep growing on me.

Perfect 2 player game!  Most of my gaming is 2 player with a close friend and we play a lot of different things.  This game makes it to the table nearly every session. Many possible paths to victory and you have to watch what your opponent is doing.  We have had several games come down to the last couple of cards.

RATING: 4
All the bad points of 7 wonders (need to know the cards in Age 3 to make meaningful decisions in Age 1 and 2) but without the original game's main redeeming feature (the flexible player count), and adds in an irritating set up process with tiny cards. 

For quick-ish two player card strategy game I'd play Splendor over this every time.

Probably the biggest hit in my house in 2016. Played at least 20 times with different people. 

I took the plunge and upgraded to the Broken Token Duel Coins. I know it was a frivolous purchase but I do love the metal coins ever so much. I also got the Broken Token wood insert. I have more money in accessories in that game, than I do the actual game.

I do not consider myself a huge fan of 7 Wonders, but this two player rendition is a proper homage with features all together unique. The card layout each age is a brilliant way to have a lively 2-player experience of drafting (a mechanic I generally do not like). The lines of building and developing seem smoothly implemented. I like how military is solved and clearly ramping up the cost of not having resources by paying what your opponent does have is smart. Nice 2-player experience.

Grandísimo y en cierto modo original juego de gestión para 2 jugadores. Me gusta más que su hermano mayor y es más fácil sacarlo a mesa al ser 2. Partidas no muy largas y con buena carga de decisiones. 
Probada la expansión Phanteon, mete más cosas curiosas pero quizá prescindible, sobretodo porque no aporta algo  diferente y puede crear casos de desequilibrio bastante descarado. Probarla antes de comprar.

RATING: 7
This is an outstanding version of 7 Wonders for two players, much better than the 2 player variant the original game provides. On every turn you are facing interesting tactical decisions which card to take and what options you leave for your opponent. This creates a similar feel to drafting cards but manages to overcome the dullness of the exercise you experience with just 2 players. Moreover, the threat of instant victory electrifies the atmosphere adding to the tension. Well done.

Perhaps this Duel version features a bit more strategic depth since you can see a part of what is coming and you can try to plan further ahead while in the original game you are navigating through foggy waters, i.e., you can try to follow some longer term plan but quite often the current draws you somewhere else.  Moreover, in addition to the wonders you can aim on the technology benefits and build your strategy on them. 

However, the game is still 7 Wonders and I would not call it better or worse as a whole. Duel is definitely an improvement for 2 players and I am happy to play it anytime.

Gyönyörű játék, izgalmas gondolkodós, deee picit sok nekem a véletlen faktor, és vacak érzés mikor látsz egy egészségtelen kártyát, ami még vagy nyolc körig nem lesz elérhető, és mivel nem lehet tempót váltani, tudod, hogy nem fogod tudni elkerülni. 

Beautiful and clever game, but with a bit too much luck in it for me. And it feels kinda crap, when you see a baaad card in the future and you just can't do anything about it, because of the lack of tempo change. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
This game is a wonderful distillation of 7 Wonders into a 2-player game, but it's so much more than just 7 Wonders for 2.  The card pyramids are such a great way of doing drafting for two players as you have to think ahead several moves when deciding what to pick, and the face down cards create enough uncertainty to prevent players from mapping out the entire age (or feeling like they need to) for each pick.  The alternate win conditions of science and military, while uncommon, present ways for players to pressure their opponents into making moves they might not want to make, and force the players to diversify their strategies.

This game does the 7 Wonders brand justice, and is a standout in the crowded field of 2-player, head-to-head games.

It chanels the feeling of 7 wonder, but in small format. Highly strategical (more so than 7 wonder), our play are often plagued by long analysis times : we feel that this game incite the "if I play that, he will play that..." reflection. The combat mecanisme makes the game more agressive than vanilla 7 wonder.

I really like the original 7 Wonders and this is a much better two player version than the original has. The fact that you can choose cards and no longer just draft them adds a more strategic element to the game. However, I think 7 Wonders shouldn't be a game for just two. I like the original with more players much better. From the games I played I felt that I no longer had this many ways to win as in the original. If you're unlucky in the beginning and don't manage to get the resources you need, you may have already lost. The calculation for the costs for buying resources you don't own makes it even worse in my opinion.

In short:
• better two player variant
• same great components and art as the original
• bad luck at the start and you probably lose

Prima ancora di provare il fratello maggiore ho approcciato questa versione 1vs1 e non posso che consigliarne l'acquisto.

3 ere, 3 differenti strade per la vittoria, possibilità di cambiare in corso (se entro le prime 2 ere) la propria strategia (per quanto sia un gioco prevalentemente tattico) e un buon livello di sfida e rigiocabilità grazie alla varietà di carte e la disposizione casuale sul display ad ogni era.

Nella sua categoria, al momento, è il mio preferito.

Like the orignal 7 Wonders, this is another favorite. Affecting my opponent's ability to purchase missing resources by constructing brown/gray resource cards is a really interesting mechanic.

Manipulating turn-orders with the "Take an extra action" ability on most of the wonders is something I feel I should prioritize but haven't been able to pin down just yet.

The amount of times I play this I should rate it. I really like this game it's fun, easy to set up with lots of interesting choices.

It still suffers from luck which means some of the games can be a total write-off. Where you have a runaway leader and just can't do anything to stop them because you have no resources. However I still love it and pull it out often. Maybe as I get better will mitigate those runaway options more.

Very similar to 7 Wonders in that your first game is kinda a lost cause, since you have no idea what works or is viable, and there are suboptimal moves that severely diminish your effectiveness if taken (but aren't obvious to a first-time player).

This is more interactive than 7 Wonders (duh).

After playing again, I think the draw has a large influence on the games, resulting in some games that feel lost the entire way and never really getting better.  If you don't get yellow cards early, or don't get resources early, you lose.  With 3 plays, it felt like there is a "best" way to play, and I don't really feel that will lead to longevity, so I do not need to own this.

RATING: 7.5
An outstanding production and a great 2-player adaptation of a modern classic in a conveniently small package. What really impressed me the most about 7 Wonders Duel is how the designers managed to create a fairly different game, which still feels a lot like the original. This is something that should really serve as a proof of their talent! 

It's almost redundant to talk about component quality. Besides maybe the cards being a little too small, everything about the production quality of this game is simply stellar! On the game-play front, 7 Wonders Duel flows perfectly fast and smooth thanks to the mechanism of the pyramid. This elegant solution keeps the game simple, preserves the drafting-feel but it also creates a tense back-and-forth between the players. The overall experience is indeed significantly tighter than regular 7 Wonders. The game really got much meaner... it's a real duel, where you're messing up with your opponent all the time by denying him/her cards, developing a monopoly of one resource or menacing him/her with military strength.

All that being said, I still prefer regular 7 Wonders because of the expansions that it got, which significantly enhance the game-play for me by adding variety, depth and interesting combos. Duel doesn't offer yet quite as much of that... but I think the expansion will fix this issue very soon. I do have instead a minor complaint about the game. Because of how the pyramid works, it's terribly important to manipulate the turn order... and therefore it's really crucial to get the wonders that allow you to take another turn. Otherwise you might find yourself in a position where there's no way you can deny your opponent the card that he/she really needs. This creates a weird feeling of unbalanced first-player problem... which is actually not entirely there, because you just need to learn how to address it.

It still used to bother me a little though before Pantheon came along. The expansion in fact pretty much solves the problem by giving you the possibility of buying God Cards on your turn instead of taking a card from the pyramid. If used well, this new mechanism can prevent your opponent from taking that one card he/she needs. At the same time, Pantheon also introduced a new layer of strategy and tactics, that spiced up the game-play quite a bit, making it therefore a better experience.

Overall 7 Wonders Duel is a very well put together package. It's easy to carry around, it has beautiful artwork and components and it offers a pretty interesting game-play. It can be mean, but it's a great game for couples that don't mind a little confrontation every now and then. Recommended!

Rating without the expansion: 7

FAVOURITE GAME -this is very good 2 player variant for 7 Wonders. It keeps the original "city building" feeling but the mechanics are quite different from the original game. Instead of drafting you have pre-defined laying patterns for each age, also the trading mechanism is a bit hardened as you have to be aware of what your opponent is collecting, because your trading cost will depend on them. Also it is interresting that you now have three victory conditions: by getting the most points at the end or you may win by military (getting a lot of red cards) or by science (getting a lot of green cards). I would say it is one of the best two-player games on the market.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
1st play: This captures a lot of the feel of 7 wonders, and I like the idea that it's possible to win with science or military now.  The game is fast, and the draft is clever.  I'm not a huge fan of 7 wonders, I'm always willing to play tho, and this is a suitable replacement for 7 wonders when there's only 2 players.  Because almost every card comes out every game, I don't know how similar repeat plays will feel.

2nd play: The game is fine, true to the original 7 wonders.  I'm not a huge fan of 7 wonders, though I won't turn down a game.  I've never felt the need to own it and this implementation feels the same to me.  The problem is, one of the strengths of 7 wonders is the flexibility of player counts.  Duel gives that up.  Plenty of 2p games I'd rather play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I enjoyed 7 wonders very much when it was released, but I played it so much and got over it for quite a while. The two first expansions are great and I think the game is not playable without them anymore, and I got enough of 7 wonders already.

7 Wonders: Duel has a lot of good ideas from new abilities of the leader and cities expansions mixed into a new implementation focused only in 2 player game. And guys, it worked so well. Bruno Cathala surely was a good addiction to the design team and now we have another great game for 2 players. Let's remember that the original 7 Wonders have a variant for 2 players, but it is not even comparable to this new experience.

Now we have the military strength excess work a role in the game and the science plays a little bit different in a way that it simply can win the game or put new strategies and possibilities for the player.

This new version is very amazing and surprised me in a positive way.

I think that this game has its pros and cons over regular 7 wonders, but it definitely is enjoyable, and I look forward to playing it again. There are a lot of things to remember, and it definitely helps to have knowledge of the original game. It's gotten rid of some fiddly bits, and simplified some aspects, while some aspects make it more difficult and almost seem as if there is less choice. Overall, a good game that I have nothing bad to say about, but also not the best that I've played.

The pyramid of available cards kindof ruins this game, as it is far too easy to reach a situation where only one player has any choice in what to buy, while the other can choose.  And this advantage is then maintained until their opponent uses a wonder with an extra turn power to switch the turn order (which they might not have).  Would be a far, far better game with a different card drafting method that didnt fall into giving a massive advantage to one player.

Very engaging and efficient game. It manages to pack in a small play time the typical ingredients of a light civ game, with a supply of cards reminiscent of the pyramid of the Valley of Kings, but more diversified.

Un bel gioco che ha diversi modi validi per vincere e che chiede a chi siede al tavolo di pianificare una solida strategia con quello che gli viene offerto ( meraviglie e prime carte disponibili e visibili) ma che costringe anche ad adeguarsi al volo ogni volta che appare qualche occasione sul tavolo. Bello anche il poter interagire,anche se in modo abbastanza indiretto, vendendo la carta che davvero serviva al tuo avversario. Sarebbe stato bello se ci fossero più meraviglie che ti permettessero di scartare le carte avversarie.

Haven't been playing this for almost a year. This is why the rating is low. Still, I think this is a very solid game and would rate it 9 otherwise. Apparently, I overplayed it back when we bought the game :)

Like everything - combination of planning and randomness, resources and "trade", different paths to victory.

My wife and I love to play 2 player strategy games.  Many times a week, we will sit down to play.  Since we bought this game about 3 months ago, it has become the first thing we grab.  We have had to print off more scoring sheets (we keep track of every game).  I don't think we've ever played less than 3 times in a sitting.  Every game is different.  We are always trying new things to develop new strategies.  And what is crazy is that we always have these moments when the cards are just not being revealed in our favor, and one of of is getting irate, yet we are still able to pull off a victory.  The 3 different methods of winning are key to the replayability of this game.  All you have to do is pretend to be going for a military or science victory to get your opponent nervous.  If they don't get nervous and change up the play-style, keep going, you might actually secure a military or science victory.  If you wait too long to take  a military victory seriously, it can become your sole purpose to keep military cards out of the other person's hand.  That frees up the other person to just rack up the additional points.  There are also lots of sneaky ways to accomplish your goals.

The only problem I have with it is that it is not possible to gain a science token on the 1st age, but at least half of the science tokens are really only useful if your get them early.  There might be creative ways of using them, but many of them NEVER get bought because they are NEVER useful by the time they are available.  I wish the science cards were more randomized throughout the game. Also, you might go for science early, not knowing if there will even be a possible science victory in the third age, with the way the cards are randomized.  It would be nice to know that there is at lease some way to gain a science victory in every game.

Only played it once so far, and while it was not a bad experience, it also failed to wow me (I may have simply had too high of expectations due to the hype rave reviews from multiple sources).  Still prefer its bigger brother with 5-7 players for the best 7-wonders experience.  Maybe it will grow on me once I get more plays, but Lost Cities, San Juan and Mr Jack are still my "go to" games for 2 players.

I got to be honest here... This game relies upon a lot of symbol recognition...
Having played 7 Wonders before... this still presents a challenge... not helped by the ~5mm symbols utilised upon the small cards.
Some larger cards or larger symbols upon the cards would definitely be good in any future reprints; although would have an impact upon table space.
Even having played 7 Wonders previously; we felt more than a bit lost in our first couple of games... significant symbol recognition is required...
We find the rules a little vague; lacking clarity in some parts; again not helped by the significance of symbols furthermore the quantity of them.
I like the game, don't get me wrong on that... but there are definitely better duelling games out there...
Playing on similar table size & cost; Lost Cities; Star Realms; Fungi; Tiny Epic Galaxies; and on a similar city building theme I'd recommend San Juan over this.

A very nice 2-player game that the only irritating thing that I have to say is that when you reveal the cards that are hidden your opponent might benefit from that. A problem that is solved when you get the Pantheon expansion and it adds a bit more to think your strategy. I highly recommend it for all players when you add the expansion.

Juego rápido pero muy entretenido. Muchas decisiones a tomar en cada turno que afectan de manera directa a la partida. Sientes que cada acción puede hacerte ganar o perder la partida. Mu tenso. El único pero es que, por ser tan rápido de jugar y por ser tan dado a revanchas, podamos quemarlo demasiado rápido. Uno de mis juegos preferidos de caja pequeña para dos jugadores.

While dropping the beloved drafting mechanic of its multiplayer parent game. Solving the 2 player draft is done well. It still rewards gamers who focus on this game, but not nearly as much as the parent game.

RATING: 9
This is an excellent 2-Player adaptation of the very popular game 7 Wonders and I think it has done justice to the original IP. The game is very easy to teach and quick to play with just enough strategy to make your decisions meaningful but not so much that it feels like hard work trying to decide what card to take next. 

The amount of games I have played that were won suddenly by either a military or science victory are fewer than the regular endgame but still satisfying and create a good tension. 

I love this game and it's become my go-to game for a quick but not too light 2 player game.

It's 7 Wonders for two players with some nice design tweaks.  After a zillion plays of the parent game, I still fail to calculate science card sets correctly,  so their simplification is welcome.  So too is the tug of war of military power; no longer can a civilization ignore its own defence entirely.  The drafting from card pyramids also works quite well.  The elevation of trade cards  through the boost they give to your income is good too.  However, in my final analysis, none of these things make Duel a better game for two than its daddy is for higher numbers.  Therefore it gets the same rating from me.

The artwork is OK and the iconography is clear.  Production quality seems to have taken a slight dip; as well as being smaller, the cards feel quite thin.

Καινούργια έκδοση του δημοφιλούς 7 wonders σχεδιασμένη για 2 άτομα. Θα παραδεχθώ πως δεν δοκίμασα ποτέ την 2 player εκδοχή του βασικού 7 wonders γιατί έπαιζε χρησιμοποιώντας dummy player. Εδώ όμως τα πράματα είναι διαφορετικά. Οι κάρτες της κάθε εποχής ξεκινούν κάτω στο τραπέζι και οι παίκτες επιλέγουν με την σειρά ποια θέλουν να πάρουν. Είναι τοποθετημένες σε πυραμίδα και όπως τις παίρνουμε ανοίγουν σιγά σιγά οι επόμενες. :)  

Κατά τα άλλα υπάρχουν μικρές διαφορές στο πως λειτουργεί το market αφού πλέον πληρώνεις στην τράπεζα για να αγοράσεις υλικά ενώ οι πράσινες τεχνολογικές κάρτες είτε σου δίνουν απευθείας νίκη αν μαζέψεις 6 διαφορετικές είτε σου δίνουν μεγάλα μπόνους αν μαζέψεις 2 ίδια. 

Ωραία και η αλλαγή στο military σκέλος του παιχνιδιού. Λειτουργεί σαν διελκυστίνδα και αναγκάζεις τον αντίπαλο να χάσει χρήματα όσο τον πιέζεις ενώ μπορείς να φτάσεις σε άμεση νίκη αν το τερματίσεις.:arrrh:

O κάθε παίκτης ξεκινά με 4 θαύματα που μπορεί να χτίσει το καθένα με διαφορετικά μπόνους. Ωραία πινελιά είναι το γεγονός πως μόνο τα 7 από αυτά θα μπορέσουν να χτιστούν, οπότε υπάρχει και εκεί μια σχετική αγωνία για το αν θα προλάβεις να χτίσεις τα δικά σου 4. 

Το artwork είναι εξαιρετικό όμως οι κάρτες είναι μικρού μεγέθους. Αυτό βέβαια έχει και τα καλά του γιατί μεταφέρετε πιο εύκολα και παίζεται και σε τραπεζάκι καφετέριας. 

Μια πολύ καλή επιλογή για 2 άτομα. Ευχάριστο παιχνίδι με λογική διάρκεια γύρω στα 20 λεπτά, και μπόλικες επιλογές. Πολύ καλά σχεδιασμένο. Well done! :)

Nach weiteren Spielen sind wir zu dem Schluss gekommen dass er doch seeeeehr glückslastig ist und müssen das Rating von 9 auf 7,5 heruntersetzen. 
Liegt man einmal hinten wird es sehr schwer hinterher zu kommen. Deckt mann dem Gegner dann auch noch Karten auf die man selber benötigt (kaum zu kontrollieren) wird es echt schwer.
Zwar kann sich das Spiel im letzten Zeitalter nochmal komplett wenden, worauf man aber nur bedingt Einfluss nehmen kann.

Ab jetzt wird die Erweiterung getestet. Vielleicht bringt die noch etwas Kick rein.

Dennoch ist 7 Wonders Duel ein schnelles, einfaches und trotz der beschriebenen, subjektiven Eindrücke, ein tolles 2 Personen Spiel.

With Pantheon expansion.

The pinnacle of boardgame 'gamefeel': everything one does feels substantial and consequential *immediately*. This system-feedback is clearest in high-tension games with very simple mechanics, where one does very little on their turn, and capitalizes on the required transparency of boardgames (i.e., that all the ways to modify the game state, and exactly how they work and respond, have to be known by the players to run the rules of the game). It's most satisfying in games with minimal luck where you KNOW you can take paths a, b and c, and what the result of each will be, and can do it in a minute of thought. There needs to be a very short space between what you do and the consequences of that action. "I take a card, I immediately let you take that other one I wanted to build your wonder and take another turn, netting that other one you wanted" feels very different than "I perform the most stastically favourable actions that have no short (and sometimes no predictable long) term consequences". 

Mechanical, yes, but system-poetry. While playing I actually appreciate the design so much it interferes with me PLAYING it; not ideal.

Much of this is diluted by the expansion, however, though it has many virtues of its own.

I found this game to be a major disappointment. For me, the original 7 Wonders was/is quite a fun game with rhythmic "group activity" card passing and drafting, quirky player interactions wherein you buy resources from and "attack" neighboring players with military cards, experience the thrill of finally completing your wonder, and sorting through seemingly brilliantly compiled and thoroughly play-tested card sets. What a design!

By contrast, this game had none of this magic for me.  No passing.  No drafting.  Boring tug of war style attacking. Single stage wonders, and card sets that didn't seem to flow very smoothly.  For my tastes, this was an average resource gathering and conversion card game based upon three sets of cards arranged in pyramids, a mechanic which felt curiously mediocre to me.  Where is the magical feeling in any of this?

This game, for my tastes, does not stand very tall on its own merits, but instead, gains its evident following from gamers who are absolutely fanatical about anything related to 7 Wonders.  Yes, but if this game were to have been released before the original 7 Wonders, would this game be considered great on its own merits?  Simply put, is this a GREAT game?  Or, is this merely a good game? For me, this plays and feels very average. There are many far better two player games out there.

The core game has an unacceptable flaw: Tiles MUST be picked by both players, meaning the highest priority tile will be decided if it is reached in an odd or in an even number of picks. Red and Green ones make you automatically win, so if one player is able to access there tiles uncontested, they will win. If you center your strategy around one of those, it is a matter of luck if you get them or not.

The expansion solves this, but the base game, because of this fault, gets a 2/10 from me.

An interesting adaptation of 7 Wonders made specifically for 2 players. Great mechanics but the game feels a little too light and empty. A lot of the spirit from the original game is here which is wonderful, but wonders just don't have the grand feeling they previously did since they're not built in a single step and feel like any other building. Expansions could really help give this game some substance.

RATING: 9
This is 7 Wonders as the two player game we truly hoped it would be. It puts the two-player variant in 7 Wonders to shame. Instead of tradition drafting you take cards from a display between the players. Some cards are free (whether just costing nothing or perhaps having an icon that one of your cards in your tableau already has) or cost some resources that you will need to have built up before hand. But the display is set up so that as cards are taken, cards that were inaccessible become available. So it is a good give and take with you wanting the card in the display but seeing that taking it will allow your opponent to take a card that will help them. And the alternate victory conditions (getting enough military to decimate your opponent's civilization or getting enough science to make your civilization superior) make that card drafting from the display even more critical. You may want to take that science card that gets you closer to your victory but that will uncover a military card that will allow your foe to advance and make it even worse for you. Balanced perfectly, 7 Wonders Duel is one of the best two-player games on the market.

Absolutely fantastic 2 player version of 7 Wonders.

Pros:
+Adds threshold win conditions for military and science.  I had multiple games where I thought I was holding those at bay enough, but they snuck through at the last minute to push for a victory
+Multiple wonders along with drafting at the beginning of the game
+Interesting risk/reward mechanic in determining what to reveal to others, or take a smaller benefit, and hope to get something better that is covered.

Buena impresión inicial, pero tras unas cuantas partidas el juego se me queda muy corto. Los juegos de tan corta duración a la larga me suelen dejar frío como un témpano.

Aunque tiene un diseño bonito, las partidas son extremadamente simples y repetitivas.

Tiene algo de estrategia y planificación, pero no es tampoco para tirar cohetes en ese sentido. No da ninguna sensación de juego de civilizaciones y en cierto modo es prácticamente abstracto.

Creo que puede funcionar mejor para gente recién llegada al hobby que para jugones curtidos. 

Finalmente le doy salida porque definitivamente siempre prefiero jugar cosas con un poquito más de duración y enjundia.

Bought this last year, played 2 games with a beer friend and we both REALLY liked it.  Vowed to play more of it, but between our game group growing (meaning less 2 player games) and other new stuff, this went on the shelf.  Well, went to game night last night and only one other person showed.  Happened to have this in my bag, just in case.  We broke it out and re-familiarized ourselves with the rules.  Played through and WOW, what a great game.  Why have I not played this sooner?  Even though the other player took control of resources, blue cards and coin generation.  I had a lock on the reserves, so I could buy what I wanted.  Any my military was monster.  So, by the third age, as my opponent started taking over science, it really was the showdown of an enlighted, huge thriving city versus the small import-only military complex.  It came down to the last face down card draw in age three.  Two cards, me one space away from military victory, even though I was the clear loser in every other facet.  50/50 shot, I choose and flip the card....  and it's a blue card.  OUCH!  Final score, 74 to 48.  I got trounced, but loved every minute of the matchup.  That, my friend, is a great game.  Get it.

Update, liked this game so much, I went and got the Broken Token organizer for this one.  It has become the latest go-to for my girlfriend and I.  We are really enjoying it.

Quick to teach, fast to play.

Because of those two features I'd consider bringing this out for non-gamers.

Otherwise I found the decision-making rather uninteresting and the overall gameplay mediocre at best.

But to be fair, I also disliked the 7 Wonders main game.

Kind of a cool but different take on the 7 Wonders theme. Choices are of a different kind than in the original, but still meaningful. Feels a bit same-y from game to game at this point, but I have heard the expansion helps to fix this (as Leaders--especially--did for the original game).

RATING: 6.5
Overall: yeah but meh. Pretty good job in order to bring 7 Wonders to two players. Though, it doesn't quite capture what is fun in the original game. In Duel there is really lots of going on, maybe too much! Quick. Serious AP -warning.

I really enjoy this game for the balanced card draw and strategy on which cards to pick. It's hard to gauge what you need exactly to win, which makes it exciting. The games are usually nail biting close. The other ways of winning are really great but they need to be more of a threat in the design. See the Pantheon expansion for more depth

Lots of two player games lack a element of complexity and randomness that comes with a  bigger set of players.  7 Wonders Duel does a great job making players build different interesting strategies with every new game.  There's a so many points to keep track of and so many different ways to win it makes players think outside the box to rise to victory.

RATING: 7
It takes the theme and feel of the original with a new card drafting system. I like the science and military victory conditions that add other paths to victory. There's a lot of tough decisions that need to be made, trying to get what you need while not setting up your opponent.

One major problem is that the game can feel very scripted. There are points in the game where you can map out the next five or so moves: If I take this, then you take that, which means I'll take this, etc.

There can also be a lot of uncontrollable luck based on how the cards are laid out. Sometimes, a specific resource card is out of reach or not included in the game at all, which can just ruin one of the players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Well hello there! 7 Wonders, while only a few plays, is decidedly mediocre for me. The only thing I like about it is its ability to scale the player count without scaling the total play time. Despite a slightly unclear rulebook and iconography, I think this game is great, and that the zero-sum nature of 2P play makes tracking your opponent's board state actually doable and useful.

An excellent 2-player game, I enjoy it more than 7 Wonders itself, in particular because I just love that competitive Military track, the variable set-up based on what cards you remove and how you build the cities in each Age...also how they are 'stacked' so you have to reveal them as if you were climbing up a skill later. The three victory conditions that can alter your strategy also don't hurt...just fantastic.

7 Wonders Duel: Pantheon
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Initial rating, based on playing once. Has a lot of the feel from the original 7 Wonders, while still very much being its own game. The main difference is that you frequently know exactly what benefit your opponent will get if you take a specific card, which influences tactics a lot. And that makes the luck of the draw worse for the unknown cards, particularly when either player is close to a sudden death military or scientific victory, which the newly revealed card potentially ending the game. I suspect I'd get thoroughly annoyed by that aspect after a couple more plays, and would reduce the rating because of it.

Duel does what 7wonders did, but for two and better.

RATING: 7
Honestly, didn't have high expectations for this game. Like other "2-player adaptations of x game," I thought this game would either feel uninspiring (too similar) to its predecessor or dull, as it fails to capture everything fun about its predecessor. But this game manages to be original/unique while preserving the fair/fun of 7-wonders. 

Essentially, the game is a race... and there are a lot of races going on simultaneous. Players need to worry about the military and science conditions, as they can end the game early, but they also need to be cognitive about the wonders (only 7 can be built) and double science tokens (they give players very powerful progress tokens). Mechanically, the race is achieved through card-drafting, which is done in a way that creates replayability without too much randomness (half the cards are shown, all but 3 cards of each age will come out, etc). And even if an opponent manages to get "lucky" and pull off a win, the game plays so quick that you can play best-of-x.

Overall, there is a lot of think about and the game manages to play quickly. I like it quite a bit.

Impressed.  Three options - buy card, sell card for cash, build a wonder from it.  Cards can only be taken if they are not pinned down by another card.  Delicious decisions as to whether to reveal a card - especially chance when revealing an upturned card - which could benefit opponent.  Three victory paths well balanced.  An inspired design and better than the in itself impressive mother game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
First impression:
-Looks TOO balanced. I mean, if you optimize your choices for each turn, doesn't really matter what you do. :) I mean that bad choices are blatantly obvious and the game even tells you about it. For example I think the military and science victory is only there to remind you to check your opponent's tableau and military levels. And if the other side pays just a little attention, it's impossibl to win that way.
-Also the cards that let you buy certain resources for just 1 gold make trading restrictions a bit pointless?
-It is not a bad game but not one I would like to play over and over again.

Sokan áradoztak, hogy ez még a nagy elődnél is jobb, és ... ha ezt így nem is merem első parti után kijelenteni, de tény, hogy szuperül működik! A harci sáv király, az alternatív győzelmi módok plusz színt visznek bele, a piramisszerű laplehelyezés is nagy ötlet, és aki a régit ismeri, annak szinte nem is kell szabálymagyarázat. Ráadásul nagyon rövid is, 20 perc alatt lemegy. Tuti sokan olyanok is megszeretik majd, akik a régit nem szerették vagy nem is próbálták ketten.
---
Azt számolgattam, hogy míg a régi 7 csodában kiegek nélkül 18 akció van (szimultán módon), addig itt összesen 60 akció, (és mellesleg előfordulhat akár 34-26 megoszlás is az egyik fél javára). Ezzel csak arra akarok utalni, hogy ha teljesen végigmegy a játék, szerintem általában hosszabb lesz, mint a sima 7 csoda.

A deep game for only 30 minutes.  Deciding when to cash in, tuck for wonders, and when to buy for you or to block your opponent makes for a lot of decisions for a relatively simple mechanic.

Initial Impression: I've never been a big fan of 7Wonders, as I've felt that for the most part it plays as a multiplayer solitaire game. This game, on the other hand, is anything but solitaire. There are multiple paths to victory and you have to pay particular attention to what your opponent is focusing on at all times. The card drafting mechanism is interesting in that you may not want to take your best option as it will open up opportunities for your opponent. Overall, I think this game holds alot of promise for repeated plays and I'm looking forward to delving into it.

I find the card drafting more interesting in this game than the original since you can plainly see many of the cards that will soon become available to you. It feels like you have a bit more control over the game and are not just simply hoping your neighbor happens to pass you something useful. Still, the game is a bit light for me and there are a few other two player fillers I would probably go to over this one.

2 player quick games i like more include Mottainai, Innoovation, Mystery Rummy Jack the Ripper, Race for the Galaxy, W1815 and  Court of Medici.  But still really like the game and cannot see me turning down a game and may even look to pick up my own copy.

(2 Players, 30 min, CLASSIC) A 2-player version of 7 Wonders, in which players build a civilization by drafting resources, buildings, and technologies from a deck of shuffled cards laid out in an overlapping pyramid. Every choice exposes more cards for your opponent to draft, so what you choose is as important as what you give away!

Loved 7 wonders but it was never good with two players.  This is the answer to that problem, but adds greatly to it.  The military and science victory conditions are awesome and the game changes up enough each play to make it fun and fresh every time.  This game is an instant classic.

Even though 7 Wonders is a classic flawless game, Duel is a rebuild improved version of it. The card selection is way more strategic and the impact of either military and science/technology cards is much more entertaining.

An expansion that adds 10-15 more cards per age and maybe a few more wonders would push this to close to a 10 ranking.

Excellent 1 v 1 mini-civilization builder that actually plays within the advertised time range - a 30 minute game that actually feels satisfying! Definitely my favorite game for when we (my wife and I) are short on time (week nights) - and will play it even if we do have extra time. Lots of fun with multiple strategies and win conditions (military, science or victory points / infrastructure - of which you have a couple different ways you can accrue the needed resources) - has some 'take that' player interaction via wonders, which is awesome, and games often come down to the last couple of turns which provides a satisfying level of tension. 

*** Great game to play with my 9 year old son, he picked it up on his first play through.

RATING: 8.5
Impressed out of the gate by this arguable "spin-off" of a game. All that is true about 7 Wonders is here (the choice between keeping something you want or keeping your opponent from a card they need, science and combat being important, and the construction of wonders)- but each are presented in a fresh, interesting way. Drafting is from a structure "mah-jongg" style, military and science can win you the game immediately if unchecked, and you receive several wonders instead of one. Fascinating...may be rated higher after more plays!

I like 7 wonders but something's bugging me in this game. I guess it's a nice variant of 7 wonders for two players, but it's not as good as the original.

I don't like that there are frequently situations in which you are forced to pick a certain card; in 7 wonders there are at least two cards you can choose from.

I still try to like this game, but I can't get past a disappointment in the first game. At the beginning of the third age, I could see that I was bound to lose: My opponent was collecting the green cards and missing one symbol. Unfortunately, the missing symbol was on both of the cards in the last row (the row that was dealt first). And since there was no possibility for me to take both of the two last cards, I lost on the final card.

I like this one more than seven wonders, since the other person has an impact on my game.

Drafting is interesting in the tiered card layout, and solves the issue the original 7 wonders had with two players not being all that interesting. Very entertaining and quick enough to fit 2 games into  30 minutes if you aren't reviewing rules. The possibility of a sudden victory through military or science also means that not letting your opponent get key cards for their strategy is just as important as getting what you need for yours.

Duel takes the very few passable bits of Seven Wonders (like building the eponymous wonders), works on them and delivers a surprisingly good two-player game that both holds the flavor of the original and at the same time improves on it: the real wonder here is how this lighter version turns the original dull multiplayer solitaire into such a fun game with lots of interactions.
Just for doing this, it should be dubbed "the eighth wonder". [i](May 2016)[/i]

[b]Update[/b] - I’ve been playing Duel several times now and I’ve enjoyed every single game so far.
Sure, the strategy is quite straightforward and doesn’t evolve too much from game to game, nonetheless it still does its job just fine: that is, the job of  a short, light game for two that requires a little improvisation and doesn’t burn your brain.
Thus, in October 2017 I raised my rating from 7 to 8.

I love this game! It's a such a great, quick tactical battle. The multiple possible win conditions really add another layer to this that wouldn't be there if it were solely a race for the most points.

I think I would rather play Arboretum or Mottainai in most situations, but I still like this one more to teach to people because the scoring is less tricky than in those other two.

The timing aspects for revealing cards are well done and it is always fun to see how things shake out. Of course there is some luck, but it is fast playing and fun. It's a game my wife requests which is always a good sign in my book.

Really strategic and enjoyable 2-player version of its namesake. Very streamlined, and all relevant information is right on the cards. Ability to pick wonders at the beginning also a great addition. Have only seen military victory when all of the right cards were flipped at exact right moment. Otherwise, I think going for the military/science victory is a fool's errand as it can be easily thwarted without some luck. Still, a solid game for under an hour.

// I like 7 Wonders a fair deal, and since we play most of
our games as 2-player (which 7 Wonders is not very good at 
- playing with Dirk is not a great experience), we've 
gotten quite a few plays out of Duel. I'm really ready for
an expansion to this, though, which will hopefully spice
up the game since it's starting to feel a little too samey
at this point to me.

Now this is what a 7 Wonders two player game should be. Despite the arguments of some on the site who defended the original game's two player variant, I was always dissatisfied with it. 7 Wonders: Duel creates a clever tiled setup which creates an even greater drafting mechanism than that of the original in my opinion. The tug of war on the military track fits perfectly as well as the threat of superior scientific advancement. It has much more of a take-that element which balances out the risk of the game becoming just a thinky, multi-step math chaining operation. It has a small footprint of rules with a good dose of interesting decisions. There is some luck of the draw as two players playing well can win or lose based on what card happens to be face down on the card setup. Regardless, this is a winner. I actually like it more than the original 7 Wonders. I rate it an 8 at present with a good chance of it becoming a 9 on future plays.

Decent setup time, quick to play, interactive, strategic and tactical. A good 2 player game, that misses the excitement of surprise plays, bluffing or game-changing plays and instead focuses on balanced play with only some hidden information. Every careful decision only brings you a small step towards victory and thus this game is rather slow paced and strategic at its core, while it still manages to flow quickly and never leaves a player out of options.

Overall very good quick 2 player game.

10x10 2016. Great 2-player version of one of my favorite games and a great way to do drafting with just 2 people- I wouldn't be surprised to see it used in some more games.  It emphasizes messing with your opponent and blocking more than in a traditional draft and you feel like you can really see what's going on and plan.  Several paths to victory and it always feels close and tense and down to the wire.  Very satisfying and fun.  Addictive.  One of the best, perhaps the best, quick 2-player game period.

Played 5 games.  First time was quite interesting, getting used to the mechanisms.  Second time was not so much fun as the resource cards were just not there for second player.  Same on third game but this time no resources for me. Nex game same.  Games 4 and 5 saw wins by science card collection.  Game 5 by myself, but also had most of the resources, 4 wonders built and nearly double points of opponent.  We are both seasoned players and both came away from this game with some disillusionment.  I think that these factors severely limit replayability.  I think there a lot more interesting two-player games out there.

The familiar scoring with 7 Wonders made this an easy transition. There are a few improvements on the cards with respect to chaining, and you don't have to worry about duplicates. Nice.

We both really enjoyed it =] She generally doesn't like games with lots of critical decision-making (she generally likes to play co-op games the most since it allows for discussion of options and assistance when making decisions), but I think this hit the perfect sweet spot: simple (generally one decision per turn) yet challenging and satisfying for her, but still very interesting for a more advanced board-gamer like me =]

Great, highly competitive two player game that made a great first impression - and my rating has increased with more plays. The game is tight, tense and highly engaging - it's a thirty minute game that offers the satisfaction and accomplishment of what would typically be a much longer game. However, the thing that makes this game shine above all else are the vast number of pathways to victory, made all the more impressive due to its limited player count; no matter how much of a monopoly the draft offers your opponent of civilisation, technology or military cards there is always a pathway available for you steal victory from the jaws of defeat. A superb game, and the depth of gameplay available from such a short game make this a perfect game for an evening after work. The only reason it doesn't hit the table every night is because I'm a much bigger fan than the missus!

I didn't give this enough credit when it released. I think I was just grumpy that they made a card game instead of a 7 Wonders 2 it something. 

Having now tried it and owning it, wow this is actually really great. There's a lot of depth due to having to constantly consider what the other player could do after you, and there are ways to win early, making military and research far more interesting than in the board game. Two thumbs up.

I quite like this version, certainly more than the two-player version of the original game. It will take a few games to know what to go for or not. In my first game I tried to pick up the two-actions green tile, but there were no green cards which would allow me to pick it.

Purchased from Major Games in Saginaw on 8/2/2017 after playing 5 times with a young fellow named Austin.

My record after those plays: 3 wins, 2 losses.

Lost the whole game — base game, expansion, promo Wonders, metal coins and wooden insert at Unrivaled 2017in Las Vegas. What a kick in the head that was.

Gary Davis replaced the base game, and I replaced the rest except for the promo cards. Hoping for Christmas.

Junto con Hive y Patchwork forma mi santísima trinidad de juegos rápidos a dos jugadores. Las partidas se mueven entorno a la media hora y los tres tipos de victoria hacen muy interesante la partida obligando (y mucho) a adaptar tu estrategia a lo que hace el contrario. Definitivamente muy recomendable. ¿Alguien se echa un par de partidas?

RATING: 10
Duel might be the best filler I've played - it certainly is the only filler to crack my personal top 10. Within its relatively short playing time is contained more tension than in many games thrice its length. Why? It's a tooth and nail battle across multiple fronts: build the greatest civ and win on VPs, OR defeat your opponent for an instant win with military might, OR outpace your opponent on the technological front for a different instant win.

With three win conditions to track and keep in balance, the game offers myriad tactical opportunities. The mechanics only amplify and augment the tension and decisions. At the forefront is the unique card tableau from which choices are made. By making only some cards visible, forward planning is possible, but only partially, and those hidden cards not only hide opportunity, but anxiety as well. Many a game is lost, for example, by flopping over a pair of cards at the end of your turn revealing a hidden military card that puts your opponent over the top. Thus tactics often shift towards not wanting to reveal new cards - a delicious tension develops between wanting to see what is hidden but wanting to force your opponent to make the reveal, even at the cost of taking a less than optimal card. 

And because this is a zero sum battle, you can calculate with some precision exactly who will (or at least can) attain which card, making the psychological dimension of the game deep, as you attempt to intuit, and at times lead, your opponent's thinking. Thus the rarity of the double turn, the only way to trump such determinancies, adds greatly to the tension and provides a pivot for the competition.

I still have not done justice to how much fun this battle of wills is, all the result of an incredibly lucid, elegant design. One of the great 2 player games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It's a nice strategy game for 2, up with Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small and Le Havre: The Inland Port. It's pretty good, but I do feel like the strategy of the game will wear off as there are few 'unseen' parts of the game: pretty much everything is on the table and given that it's you vs them, you'll have had everything at one point or other.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Nice, tense game that offers quite a little punch for such a small game. It's still just drafting, but the card pyramid adds a strategic dimension to the drafting mechanic while preserving the "push your luck" element of the base game (passing a hand in the hopes that a card will come back to you). 

The best part about this game is that it's drafting that doesn't require memory, which is a great improvement to 7 Wonders (the memory aspect of drafting games is my least favorite part about them).

This is a very enjoyable retread of the full game; simplified a little and well polished - making for faster play than the original. Maybe a little too polished for my tastes as it felt lacking a bit - which is perhaps an unfair comparison with the full game, but its two player variant is very good and I'm not sure I don't enjoy it more. More plays could convince me either way.

:thumbsup: [b]POSITIVE POINTS:[/b]

++ A great implementation of 7 Wonders for 2 players only (my most common player count), that capture most of the feel of the original game, but with new gameplay, now with more tension and in a small package.
++ I like the new way of drafting, using an imperfect information method, showing only half the cards and also removing 3 cards per Age per game. This add to the tension, when you draft a card that will reveal new cards to your opponent, but also when you are trying to shape your strategy (ex. Are there a lot of military cards or Science cards that are out of the games?).
++ I really like the alternative way of winning, the science victory and the great implementation of the military conflict that work great and that really show the duel. This add a layer of putting pressure on your opponent, forcing them to pay attention to their opponent.
++ I like that science is no longer just a set collection, and that you can get Progress token which may help your strategy, which add another new layer to the game.
++ Great game insert which hold everything in an orderly fashion (though, as usual, I will need to get rid of it to fit in the expansion).
++ Great card graphic design, that is clean and clear (better than the original which was already great).
++ Easy to teach (super easy to teach if you have played 7 Wonders before, as you will be familiar with most of the iconography), fast to set-up and fast to play.
++ There is one expansion available for this game (which is useful to refresh the game when we have overplayed it).
++ Adding in Pantheon increase the gameplay depth and lower the randomness by adding a new twist to the game, without too much new rules.
++ Adding in Pantheon really multiple the possibilities of strategy (and refine the obvious one, like the scientific victory is now easier to achieve) and also correct the problem of a player being screwed at the beginning of Age 3, because by invoking the god power, you no longer have to take a cards from the pyramid, and thus you can change the order of the draw this way too.
++ A second expansion is in the work.

 

:thumbsdown: [b]NEGATIVE POINTS:[/b]

-- I'm was not really fond of the way the ressources cost, scaling the value according to the number of this same ressource produce by your opponent. My wife found it fiddly to always having to check my tableau to calculate the cost of her ressources and sometimes miscalculated (after a few games this no longer happens though, so now, I guess this is no longer a negative, as this method is good because it's another way to put pressure on your opponent).
-- Component wise, everything was of good quality, but my Wonder cards where really warped. The replacements sent were also warped (which is a bummer when you ask for replacement cards and you receive warped cards again). After a month under more than 50 pounds of book over them, they are now still a bit curved but playable, but they still tend to curve back over time.
-- It's a 2-players only game, and for whatever reason, I don't like buying 2-players only games, even though I play a lot of my game just with my wife.
-- Sometime, either if you opponent doesn't play well, or because of the really unfortunate cards order, one player can be pretty much screwed at the beginning of the 3rd age, knowing he/she has already lost and this is not fun for that player (but this is really rare (1 game out of 15 maybe), as usually, even if you think you lag behind or you are maybe screwed, there are ways to change that).
-- Adding in Pantheon increase a lot the downtime in some games (because it add so much possibilities), lengthen the setup time a bit and lengthen the game time (but not too much to be detrimental).

It's a great 2 player game.  My wife LOVES 7 Wonders and now we can play when there isn't enough to play the regular version.  There is almost a chess element to this version, in regards to how you can manipulate which cards are revealed and which ones are picked up.  We have had a military victory, science victory and a regular victory.  Military, Science, and Wonders, are all important and cannot be dismissed and even if they are not winning trumps, you can use them to manipulate the other player.  Games are fast, easy to setup, and easy to play.  Once you get going you can bust through a game in no time.

RATING: 7
A really nice two-player game, taking many mechanisms and ideas from 7 wonders, and reshaping them to make it more interesting for two.

The two big changes are:

1) Instead of drafting, a pyramid of cards is created, and players may only choose cards that aren't stuck under other cards of the pyramid. This creates an interesting dynamic of getting cards you want, but being wary of "unlocking" useful cards for your opponent.

2) Instant win conditions. Military has been converted to a tug-of-war type battle, where each military you play pushes a military token toward your opponent's side of the military track. If you get the token all the way down the track you win. Science has also turned into an instant win for collecting a large variety of science cards. This also adds a lot of interest, as you need to watch out for what you allow your opponent to take for fear of them advancing to an instant win.

Overall, a really nice game, rather than the cash grabs you often see on these spin-offs of popular titles.

My go-to 2-player game.  A game where you win by military, science, or victory points.  This game gives you multiple options to outwit your opponent.  Great 1-on-1 card pick-up game that allows you to strategize against how your opponent is currently playing.  You can easily change your play style midway through the game based on how your opponent has adapted your strategy. A must-have 2-player board game in anyone's collection.

My wife and I enjoy this game very much. The variable set up of removing 3 cards from each deck doesn't add THAT much in terms of replay ability, but it doesn't need it. The order in which cards are drafted off the central structure creates so much variability. All in all, it's a great 2 player game, with tons of strategy, and forces you to try to think 3-4 moves ahead once you get good at the game and play against an equally experienced opponent.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I've only played it twice. It's much better than two player 7 Wonders and I think it might be a better game overall. It basically 'feels' the same as regular 7 Wonders, but the small difference add up to a very different gaming experience.  

I'm a little concerned about how overpowered a lucky resource distribution appears to be, but more plays will tell whether bad luck can be overcome with skill. If not, the game is still good, but I could see it finally being closer to a six or seven. Better-luck-next-time is not the sort of thing I'm looking for in a game of this type. 

Still, it has a little bit more to think about than the multiplayer version and it seems like there might be several different ways to win, especially with the auto-win possibilities in military and progress. I also really like the drafting board, which gives the game a nice combination of look-ahead and randomness. 

Time will tell. I will revisit these comments as I play more.

A tactically nastier game than the original...explores game theory typically relegated to 2-player abstracts, such as tempo, forces and sacrifices, and combines it with its fully Euro older brother to make a game that is better than the original.

This is 7 Wonders beautifully distilled for two players. The cards are chosen from a public tableau rather than drafting, but this is more tactics driven fro two players than playing the full 7 Wonders with a dummy player.

Fantastic. I can't wait to get the expansion and play it more.

Another very good 7w from Mr. Bauza, but a very different beast than the original. I still like the original more, but 7W:D also frequently hits the table. For 2 players, we rarely take out the original now, but that is mainly due to the setup time (with all expansions) as well as the fact that 7W gets frequently played with more players (which obviously is not possbile with Duel).

Awesome 2 player version of 7 Wonders.  One of my favorite 2 player games.  I would rate this a 10 except after playing several times there seems to be only 1 or 2 strategies to pursue and experienced players will each pick one and race to the end in a very linear fashion.

Hoping expansions will open up some new strategies.

[b]Includes 7 Wonders Duel: Pantheon[/b]

I'm glad I read reviews on this one. I would have never guessed that this is a game I'd want to own based on my lackluster interest in the original. It's a very different game compared to standard 7 Wonders. The symbols all look the same, but the drafting of cards from the various pyramid shapes each round adds a totally new dimension very suitable for two players.

I think this is a game that both my wife and I will enjoy, very much up there with other classic two-player-only games like Battle Line and such.

Update: four plays now, and I can safely say this might be one of the best two-player games that is playable in 45 minutes. The three possible win conditions of military, science, or points adds a surprising amount of tension. There's a heck of a lot of game in this little box, and it's become a favorite of one of my coworkers.

A great 2-player game! A very tight back and forth through all 3 rounds with very smooth game play, draft a card, do 1 of 3 things with that card, and keep moving forward. The ages move fast and I think it really can be played in 30 minutes, which I didn't think would be true. The different victory conditions are also a nice touch as I like the tension of never knowing when the game may end too. The only thing I wish is that the cards were a little bigger, but given the layout with each age and unique drafting mechanism I can understand why they are small. This one will stay in the rotation for a long time and if the expansions do follow this game will be even better.

RATING: 6
What I like about the game is that it looks gorgeous. Somebody went the extra mile here. I also enjoy the variety of strategies that are offered. Three different ways to win the game, that's unique!

A negative point would be the tiny cards. I like to build things, to create cities, to dwell in the majesty of my creation, to intimidate my opponent, but building these micro-civilisations is neither satisfying nor intimidating.  

Another thing that bothers me are the guild cards. I don't really find them interesting. Sure, you can get a lot of points from them, but they are somehow out of place in the third age. It's the game's grand finale and what do you do? You count cards. It slows down the game and takes away a lot of the suspense. 

In general, there is too much going on for me for such a "small" game, and I have a hard time looking at the many different symbols, comparing my opponent's cards with my own etc.  

One last thing: this game is mean on a very uncomfortable level. I have no problems with open confrontation, like in Chess or Magic: The Gathering. When you play these games, you know what you get. But every time I directly hurt my opponent in 7 Wonders: Duel, it just feels mean to me, because i could have done something else instead. For example, I could have picked up something else than the military card that makes my opponent lose money; I could have activated another wonder instead of the one that destroys a building which my opponent desperately needs. It feels like I have the choice: to live in peaceful harmony with my opponent, play my little solo game and focus on making my city great and prosperous; but instead, just because I am mean bastard, I make my opponent suffer. Not enough to make it appear like a declaration of war. Just sporadically, just enough to get on my opponent's nerves.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Wow, 7 Wonders Duel comes in a small box but packs a powerful punch.  With just two players every decision seems crucial.  It feels like there is so much going on each round and money becomes real tight if you aren't careful.  Of the games I have played this and The Voyages of Marco Polo are my favourite of 2015.

A really nice two-player conversion of 7 Wonders. I love the choices of whether or not to expose more cards for your opponent (something I always seem to be on the wrong side of) by getting that one card that would really help you. Definitely a keeper.

Wonderful 2 player game. I like this much more than the full sized game--despite the tiny cards. It is already a table hog so I know that full-sized cards would be asinine. However I really dislike minicards.

Instabuy is right...

Well, it isn't. The game was decent, but it was nothing special. It feels like the commerce scientific advance is too powerful, but maybe this was just me. Some decisions feel a bit scripted, since very often parity determines who will get the precious card (thanks, maths!). It's nowhere near a bad game, but I think I'll stick to two-player 7 Wonders if I REALLY want my 2P wonder-building fix.

Good 2p implementation of 7 Wonders with some pluses and some minuses.

Plus:  Iconography indicating "linked" cards, simplified science scoring, simplified military scoring.
Minus:  The drafting pyramid doesn't work as well as the hand drafting in 7 Wonders original.  Choices feel much more limited rather than having multiple good choices each turn.

Overall, I score it a half-point lower than 7 Wonders.  Would like to try the 2p variant of the original game.

First impression: Neat transcription of the full game into a 2 player-version. The authors have gotten rid of some cruft, and worked hard to make it all work for both opponents. I'm strongly inclined to say that they succeeded quite well. The advantage is that it will all make you feel right at home... but the disadvantage is the very strong zero-sum nature of the game, and difficulty in selecting a proper upgrade path of your own because of how half the cards in an era is placed face down. Therefore you're limited by what is available, and have to make do with simplistic [i]If I don't take that card then she will and that will prove a greater threat so I have to bury it[/i]-deliberations. I've long since outgrown such niceties, but for others it might just strike the right chord. Still, there's not a great deal in the ways of strategy available to you: it's military, blue buildings, yaddayaddayadda. (Told you you'd feel right at home.)

It was genuinely nice to have played the game, but I think the buck stops here.

Zanim kupiłam Pojedynek miałam już klasyczne 7 cudów, długo się wahałam, czy w takim razie jest sens? Niezliczona ilość recenzji i odpowiedzi, że to jedna z najlepszych gier dwuosobowych w końcu mnie przekonała i nie żałuję. Gra jest świetna, stosunkowo szybka i łatwa do opanowania (szczególnie, jeśli ktoś już grał w 7 cudów), za każdym razem rozgrywka jest ciekawa. Jedynie karty ciężko oderwać od stołu i obawiam się, że mogą szybko ulec zniszczeniu bez oprawienia w koszulki. Z dodatkiem nabiera jeszcze większych rumieńców.

Great adaptation of the original 7 Wonders game. As the original game had a less-than-stellar 2-player variant, it made sense to see the 2-player-only game join the ranks of one of my favorites. The only criticism I have related to this game is how the flow of the game can easily come un-balanced. Most times when we have played, wins were evident from the second age. It seemed that players can take the lead and easily run away with it, leading to blow-out wins. I think the challenge now will be how to counter this when you are at a disadvantage in the game.

Great adaptation of the 7 Wonders mechanics for two players. The game feels very much like it's big sibling, while being much tighter and more enjoyable than the original 2-player workaround. After several plays, there doesn't seem to be a dominant strategy, but rather a dynamic back and forth between both players competing for cards, resources and military might. The wonders don't look all that impressive at first glance, but do not be mislead: they are quite powerful, especially the ones offering double turns, making the initial draft both non-trivial and strategically impactful.

Great 2 player game. Excellent job porting over 7 wonders and making drafting work for 2 players. I do have concerns with the cards becoming stale. Sometime the game can feel like it is on rails and the winner is set from very early on.

As anyone who's tried it knows, the 2-player variant for 7 Wonders never worked well. Anyone I know abandoned it in favor of other options like playing multiple boards at once. So a true 2-player reimplementation was welcome!

This will feel very familiar to those who have played 7W, with a few key differences. For example, the cost to purchase resources from a neighbor is not fixed, military power is a constant push-pull, and science is now a strategy you really have to commit to in order to make it work. These changes were easy to grasp so veterans can just about dive right in.

I would like to play this more to get a feel for how much depth and replayability it has. But in general I'm feeling favorable towards this being a two-player option we'll reach for regularly.

RATING: 10
This game provides a lot for a tiny box it has. It is designed to be a battle between 2 players only and I believe it really shines in what it do.
There is a huge amount of tactics in which card to pick (not only what I need, but also pick what my opponent desperately needs). There are three ways of victory (points, science, military) so you can play strategically but I believe you should focus on what is best for you now.

What I like:
- Interesting and original drafting mechanism (different card pyramids for each of the three ages)
- Very quick play time (my experience is between 20-25 minutes per game), yet the games are very intense.
- tiny box, and the content could be in even smaller box, so great when traveling for example. Therefore I like the small cards. I don't have any issue with them at all.
- I must repeat myself, but I am amazed how much the game provides for just a small content. Simple and easy grasped rules, tight game play, interesting decisions.

What I dislike:
- Although civilization theme, I don't care about the card meaning. I don't build Sawmill, I just build 2wood resource for 2 gold. The pictures on cards are tiny and I really don't care about them as well. Theme is a mediocre at best.
- This game could be unforgiving and harsh. In case one of players is much better than another, the game could be frustrating for the other one.
- My only game wise con is that Wonders with the extra round ability are too strong and they are first pick material no matter what. There is simply no way to leave this wonder and pick the one without extra round, which I found annoying a bit.

I already liked the 2 player variant of the original 7 Wonders, but this is even better.
I think the main reason I consider it to be an excellent game is that is has three different paths to victory (civilian, military, and scientific) and all three kinds of victory can realistically be achieved. This helps a lot to keep the game suspenseful until shortly before its end. One player may have a large lead in victory points, but because he probably neglected military and/or science in order to get his VP, the other player often still has a good chance to win the game.
Moreover, I like how the designers managed to create quite a deep game with such a short playing time.
It is also nice that it is so small and thus easily transportable.

Un juego para 2, rápido y con mucha miga. Me ha parecido el gran descubrimiento de Essen2015. Los juegos de Draft siempre me han gustado, pero no había encontrado ninguno que me terminara de encajar... Y este ha sido un descubrimiento impresionante. Por criticar cosas, el jugador inicial debería tener alguna desventaja respecto al segundo, pero a parte de eso... me parece uno de los pocos juegos dignos de ser llamados juegazos.

Very good 2 player game, my favorite at the moment. I enjoy it better than the original 7 Wonders. 

The way the cards are revealed and chosen really makes you think: "Do I want this card that much that I risk giving my opponent the card that he needs? Do I risk revealing a card that may help my opponent progress on the Military/technology win condition?". The actions also give you such a choice: "Do I build this card and risk having no money for something next turn? Do I turn it in for gold and have fewer resources or do I build a wonder with it? "

As a companion to 7 Wonders, this offers just enough of a unique take that I'm happy to have it in my collection. My girlfriend loves playing it, though neither of us has much of a handle on the strategy after five or six games. We've already had her win a game through military might, and me win a science game, even though both seem highly unlikely in the grand scheme of things. 

Biggest dislike is the cards themselves, which are very small and slippery and kind of unpleasant to handle. Beyond that, the mechanics of the game are solid, though jumping over from normal 7 Wonders requires a bit of adapting. In regular 7 Wonders trashing cards is a part of a specific sort of strategy, but not something you do all that often. In my limited experience with 7WD, you end up trashing a fair number of cards, which means that early Yellow cards are a huge boon to your coin revenue and thus your mid- and late-game plotting. If you fall way behind on Yellows it can be tough to get back into the game.

Strongest positives are the cool pyramids that you get to make with the cards that add a wrinkle to a 2P drafting game. As you get more experienced, you learn what the risks and rewards of opening up a certain facedown card might be, and you can mindgame your opponent into thinking you want to pursue one strategy rather than another. On the other hand, because there is perfect information about your opponent's cards, you should never feel TOO blindsided by a particular event. The way Wonders work in this game is also pretty cool, and deciding whether or not to prioritize a Wonder strategy early is a lot different than in the normal game.

This game is one of our current favorites for a quick option after dinner/before bed.

Beer Comparison: a well-made, consistently enjoyable Brown Ale like Bell's.

It sure looks pretty, but the gameplay is dry and shallow and the design uninspired. I'm really not a fan of the original 7 Wonders, so, relative to that, I think this 2P version is neat. It just doesn't compare favorably with other 2P games in my collection. It fell absolutely flat with my 12yo daughter, who is a big fan of most of the Kosmos 2P series.

This is a good version of 7 Wonders for 2 people.  The immediate win on either Science or Military is not my favorite aspect of the game.  Sometimes the luck of the deal can determine the winner.  I played a game where I was 1 away from a military victory and the opponent was 1 away from a Science victory.  During the entire game I had always tried to obtain any Science card at any cost, but they were always revealed for the opponent.  Then when the Age 3 cards were dealt, a Science was up front instead of military, and the opponent won instantly.

I already liked the original 7 Wonders, but it's often only me and my significant other playing. For this, the two-player variant of the original 7 Wonders was not our favourite. Of course I was psyched when we I heard of this version.

Played it several times by now with different people. We always liked the game. Every game was different so far and it never was boring.

Sometimes during some of the games I had the feeling of one person running in front a lot. It always turned out in draws. We even scored one military and one scientific win each.

All in all - great game!

Vous connaissez 7Wonders ? Le jeu qui a gagné tous les prix ludiques possibles et inimaginables il y a quelques années ? Si vous ne connaissez pas, on ne peut que vous encourager à le découvrir. Ou alors découvrir 7Wonders Duel, qui est sa variante à 2 joueurs. Alors, ne me faites pas dire ce que j'ai pas dit : ce n'est pas le même jeu ! Même thématique, même graphisme, sensations de jeu assez proches, mais la mécanique change tout de même avec un système de cartes pyramidale que l'on va prendre à tour de rôle, toujours pour produire des ressources avec des cartes marrons, construire nos bâtiments améliorés avec les cartes jaunes, s'améliorer en militaire avec les cartes rouges, faire du prestige avec les cartes bleu, etc ... Proche de 7Wonders, mais pas 7Wonders. Un peu partout, j'entends dire que c'est le meilleur des jeux à 2 (du moment, ça c'est sur, mais rien ne détrônera Caribooh )

Maybe i´m being too harsh here, but the general feeling after just one play is disappointment, taking into account  its "father" game.
There is no need to search for materials as anything you don´t have may be bought to the bank (commerce cards just saves you one coin), military power is almost irrelevant since it´s easy to keep the balance in a plain "thug of war" line, science advantage is almost null unless you gather six cards but this is easily prevented by your oppponent, etc. Also odd, is the fact of beeing normal the last few cards serves you no purpose and need to be discarded for coins. 
Furthermore, i feel this is a game that makes little sense out of its own, i mean, for people who don´t know 7 wonders and don´t feel the need for a two player version of the game, this looks like a quite weak game.
At least, the nice artwork and the swift mechanics of the original game are still present here, not so bad.

7 Wonders Duel is a nice 2 player game, and a good variant on the ever so popular 7 Wonders.

I like the alternative win conditions (though they are more a way to force the opponent to react than to actually win), the very nice inlay and how quick it is played. What I like less is the fiddly and small cards (though that might be my problem) and what I do not like is that after 8-10 games it seems more and more that randomness is a VERY big factor in this game. Who begins is very relevant, what cards you uncover is VERY relevant (to the point where your opponent just loses if you have eg 1-2 Wonders that let you have another turn and you can 'steal' all the science cards your opponent can't reach in time), but all in all a good game. 

This is how you pack a smallbox game correctly, splendor/NMBR9!

Voorbereiding :

-	Rood schild in het midden van het bord
-	4 militaire tokens open op het bord
-	5 wetenschapstokens op het bord
-	Elke speler krijgt 7 geld
-	Selectie van de wonders: er liggen 4 willekeurige wonders, de eerste speler kiest een wonder, de tweede speler kiest twee wonders en tenslotte neemt de eerste speler het overgebleven wonder. Doe dit nogmaals, maar laat nu de tweede speler beginnen met kiezen.
-	Verwijder 3 kaarten uit elke tijdperk stapel, voeg 3 paarse kaarten toe aan de tijdperk 3stapel. Verwijder de overige paarse kaarten.

Handelen:

-	Je kan altijd ontbrekende grondstoffen van de bank kopen.
-	Kost = 2 + aantal symbolen van dezelfde grondstof (bruin en grijs) bij de tegenspeler
-	Sommige gele kaarten zorgen ervoor dat je voor een grondstof slechts 1 munt moet betalen.

Speeloverzicht:

Leg de kaarten zoals aangeduid op het voorbeeld.
Kies een kaart die vrij ligt (niet afgedekt door 1 of 2 andere kaarten).

1/ betaal de kost en bouw de kaart
2/ leg de kaart op de aflegstapel en ontvang 2 geld (+1 geld voor elke gele kaart in je stad)
3/ bouw een wonder

Als het zevende wonder is gebouwd, verdwijnt het achtste wonder uit het spel.

De speler die het er slechtst voor staat op militair gebied, kiest wie het volgende tijdperk mag beginnen.

Militair: voor elk schild verplaats je het schild een vakje dichter naar de zone van de tegenspeler. Als het schild het laatste vakje van de tegenspeler bereikt, win je onmiddellijk.

Wetenschap: elke keer als je twee groene kaarten met hetzelfde symbool verzamelt, mag je onmiddellijk een wetenschapstoken nemen. Wanneer je 6 verschillende symbolen hebt verzameld, win je het spel onmiddellijk.

Wanneer niemand wint via wetenschap of door het militaire gevecht, dan wint de speler met het meeste overwinningspunten.

Doesn't quite scratch the drafting itch, but it's a fun game that seems to have more depth for me to explore upon further plays. Still... I think I prefer Castles of Burgundy for a two player game with this theme/feeling. Time will tell.

A much better game for two than the variant that came with the original game. The most problematic elements for two players --- military and buying resources --- are dealt with beautifully. The array of partially exposed cards also beats two-player drafting, and, not least, the iconography makes noticing the chaining possibilities easier. The science strategy still seems pretty weak, though.

Cynthia and I played our first game of it last night. I think it is a faithful two-player experience of 7 Wonders—fun and engaging all the way up until the end.  By its nature as a two-player game, it necessarily lacks the experience of having multiple players and passing cards around that the original 7 Wonders has.  But it is probably as good a two-player 7 Wonders game as they could have devised.  I am comfortable rating it a '7' after one play, and can see it moving up once I have several more games under my belt.

Fantastic two person, seriously considering making my rating a 10. 

This basically takes the fun of 7 wonders (which is fun but lacks strategy) and adds decisions which actually feel important. It really is a tug of war with you and your opponent as you manage to avoid military and science defeats while still playing optimally. 

Wonderful game with lots of replay value and is PERFECT for casual gamers or playing with a partner. 

*If you own 7 wonders I'm not sure if this adds enough variation to be worth the pick up, but the two player mode is infinitely better than the 7 wonders game 2 person variant with the dummy player.

A tense drafting game of weighing your options. Multiple paths to victory let each game feel different. The wrong cards can ruin your game. Opening something to your opponent can also crush you. Not played 7 Wonders, but now I don't feel the need. The only downside to me is setup.

RATING: 6
A quick playing, dedicated two player game, adapted from the 7 Wonders universe.  Gone is the Fairly Tale pass the cards mechanic, replaced by alternately drawing cards off a pyramid structure in the centre of the table.  As cards are drawn, other cards are unlocked and/or revealed, possibly giving opportunities to your opponent.  A tug of war military track replaces the war with neighbours mechanic from the original game.  The rest feels nice and familiar.  Three spheres of victory means you have to watch your opponent carefully and react accordingly. 

First game was good, second game was "hmmm, is that it?".  It felt too easy, with no tension.  The bloom will fall from this rose quite quickly I suspect.  Much, much better two player games on the shelf for this to compete with - not a good sign.

Turned out to be as good as I had hoped.   Needed a good 2p game to play with my wife, and this works perfectly.   The small cards frustrated me at first, but this game has a pretty high table sprawl, so it makes some sense.  The three paths to victory are all viable and need to be payed attention to at all times.   There's just enough forward planning to be interesting without being annoying.   May need some expansions pretty soon to stay fresh, as the card pool isn't that deep.

Plays quite different from original 7W, as it requires more focus on your opponent and planning several moves ahead. The setting and actions feel very similar, but the end result is totally its own game. Liking 7W is no guarantee that you will like this game. Players looking for meaty 2-player games should give this a look.

Really great (and portable) game, fantastic artwork and production quality.  I feel the last round is a bit flat, like there should be more guild cards, or that each round is just a bit too short. So..great, but could be better. The box, although specially designed with various compartments etc, allows all the cards to become dislodged and mixed around which is a real pain. I do wish the cards were full sized, but I guess this would make it less portable.

7 Wonders Duel is an enjoyable 2-player game, with plenty of paths to victory.  I like the variable layout of the cards, the fact that some are exposed and some are revealed, and the ever-present threat of victories through science or war.

Definitely better than the 2-player variant of 7 Wonders. The pyramid structure of the card layout really leads to some tough tactical decisions. When every card is going to you or your opponent, it's extremely important to weigh every decision carefully.

RATING: 7
Enjoyed my first play. Very tense and I like the push/pull of military/science and the race to build all your wonders. Couple critiques:

- Not sure on replayability... saw almost all the cards in the first play, I'm sure there will be expansions
- Limited options. This could be good or bad, on your turn you often have to choose from only 2 or 3 cards, the decisions are sometimes obvious, but often you do need to consider what you need to build your wonder, block your opponent, etc. For a small box two player game this is probably a good thing.
- The main critique is that by the time you get to the 3rd round the game almost plays itself... at this point you're already invested in science/military/VPs... we were able to math out almost the entire 3rd round before drafting a single card.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
7 Wonders: Duel is the attempt to make 7 Wonders into a better game than the 2-player variant included with the main game. As with most people, I definitely see this as a success. In fact, I like it a lot more than 7 Wonders. The main reason for this, is that it keeps the basics of 7 Wonders (drafting, resources, military, science, guilds, unique wonders, etc.) but amps up the tension of the game. How does it do this? 

-Instead of Science and Millitary just being VP paths in 7WD, they can instantly end the game in victory for the person that focuses on it. 

-The pool drafting of where there are some cards face-down and some face-up (and how these are flipped up) can be really nerve wracking. Especially when opponents are going for Military/Science victory.

-Resource management is even trickier since resources opponents acquire make your deficiencies in those specific resources, more expensive to deal with.

-Each player starts with 4 wonders each. That said, the game is called 7 Wonders for a reason... As soon as a player builds their fourth Wonder, that denies their opponent from  ever building their fourth.

The replay value of this game is fairly decent. You don't use all of the science progress markers, guilds or wonders each game. There are also 3 cards randomly removed from the 3 age decks. This is my one negative of the game. It can be disappointing to learn that you were planning on going for Science/Military victory and that option is not really available to you based on the cards randomly removed from the deck. Overall, this is decent 2-player game. There are other 2-player game I prefer.

After an initial rating of 8 I dropped it to 6 with repeated plays. It just happens to frequently that Age three becomes calcuable, leading to just counting at the beginning of the age to see if one should start or go second, and quite often deciding the game by that. Makes the whole thing quite anticlimactic.

Fantastic rehash of it's big brother. Different experience and a nice addition to the 2-player collection (though why they made the box a hint larger than the similar Kosmos ones is annoying).

Would be a 9 if it had a bit more variety (from card effects) when playing it multiple times.

RATING: 8
A very solid 2p game, with a minimal time investment and shallow learning curve. Multiple paths to victory add tension and strategic flexibility to the experience as well. Not only can you pursue military and science as a means of victory, but you can also leverage them to maneuver your opponent into weakened positions, forcing them to take sub-optimal moves, thereby acquiring and maintaining control of the game for yourself. The military track is a bit boring as it is just a push-of-war, but the technology cards are interesting. 7 different technology symbols win the game, but for each pair you manage to acquire you gain a very powerful progress token. Managing and choosing between these to science paths is very interesting. The game feels a bit over balanced, but it has been boiled down well for two players, and offers a bit of a deeper feel than most other 2p-exclusive titles.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A great re-imagining of 7 Wonders. The back-and-forth nature of the game is fantastic, and there's enough look-ahead and uncertainty in the game to contribute to a tense experience. This doesn't replace 7 Wonders for me, as that's a game that's better with more, but this is a much better two player experience than standard 7 Wonders. There's enough tweaks here to make it a different, but familiar, experience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Somehow I feel this is less than its older brother.  The decisions seem more arbitrary because very few doors are closed to you due to past choices.  The spatial element of draftable cards is a big detraction, where you can see, if I let my opponent get that card I'll lose, or hmmm, the one card that will win the game for me fell into my lap through no skill of my own.

7 Wonders is in my Top 10 of all time. I love that it plays large groups with no downtime. Duel is a different beast altogether. It uses a drafting style mechanic, but it is not 7 Wonders.

It is, instead, a great little game that stands on its own. This one actually still gets played in larger groups: winner stays, loser trades. Yes, it is that good. My game of 2015.

Duel doesn't really capture the drafting feel of 7 Wonders proper, although it incorporates many of the secondary elements of the original game. I just don't find the drafting replacement enjoyable, but I'm willing to give it another chance. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Thematically similar to but mechanically very different from 7 Wonders, most notably in how "drafting" functions (although resources, military, science, and wonders themselves are also pretty far from the 7 Wonders implementation thereof). Cards are [partially] layered in alternative face-up and face-down rows. At first, only the foremost face-up cards can be "drafted", but as cards are [entirely] uncovered, they become available (and flipped face-up if face-down). Unlike the original game, this becomes a game of denial and risk management first and foremost. You must avoid making available a military or science card to an opponent who's strong in that area (both are insta-win conditions in Duel), but half the cards are hidden, so good luck with that. 

I can see how some people would enjoy the tension that arises from this ("no whammies"), and I understand that 7 Wonders has a similar lack of control in what cards intermediary players draft/pass, but this mechanic seems too luck-based in Duel. Perhaps with greater knowledge of all possible cards in an age, face-down cards become largely predictable, but I don't care for this kind of mechanic.

I'll try playing with all face-up cards a few times to see how that goes.

I like this more than the original 7 Wonders. The instant victory conditions bring more immediately tense situations in the middle of the game. The science chip bonuses are cool. I think it fixes fiddly things about military & science scoring that I thought made the original game more convoluted. I like that you get to build more things in this game and burning cards for cash is also more viable. I haven't decided on my preference between card drafting or Dual's partially visible stacking.

Really good compact distilled 2 player version of 7-wonders.  One critique is that it is a little heavy on the icons.  Me and my wife end up spending more time than we would like looking up rules definitions for the science tokens, guild and gold card symbols.  Seems a little easy to block the 'instant win' military or science strategies once you know what you are doing with just the base game, but the Pantheon expansion opens this up a bit.

Szeretem a 7 csodát, a kevés általam ismert játék közül az egyik kedvencem. Antoine Bauza-t kedvenc játéktervezőmnek mondhatom (jelenleg), hisz egyetlen más tervezőtől sem birtoklok ennyi játékot. A játék BGG helyezésével is tisztában vagyok. Sőt, Bruno Cathala sem ismeretlen számomra, megannyi játékáról olvastam jót – mindazonáltal még nem volt szerencsém egyik játékához sem –, tehát az előjelek roppant kedvezőek voltak. Ám mindezek ellenére sem hittem, hogy a Duel ennyire jól eltalált, annyire élvezetes game lesz! Pedig de! Zanzásítva és kiterjesztve az alap 7 csoda, leredukálva két főre, fenomenális! Gyors, egyszerű (az alap 7 csodát ismerőknek), de mégis komplexebb játékélményt nyújtó, szép, mi mást írjak még róla?! Sikerült még inkább áramvonalasabbá tenni egy egyébként is nagyszerű játékot. Tényleg csak ajnározni tudom! Jó vétel volt!

RATING: 9
A fantastic 2 player experience! The tension is high all the way to the end because of the two "sudden death"-criteria. The wonders create sudden change of "turn order" due to the extra turn actions, so you can never feel certain which card could be at your disposal next time. Each game feel very different, and there are certainly a lot of ways to win the game. Even money can be a strategy to win this game (unlike the original game).
I must say this game was a big surprise for me. I never would have imagined this to be a close to 10 for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A very wonderful 2 player game that I enjoy with my non-gamer girlfriend.

Pros:
1. Many concepts(which add complexity), yet not complicated or hard to understand.
2. Quick to play
3. Gorgeous art that captures the eyes of even the non-gamers( My girlfriend would always say yes to a game of duel just because of the art.)
+ The cover is composed of a male and female, makes it feel like a couple game.
4. Game is not "strategic" , but it's tactical decisions can be very complex to make and game changing, adding to the fun and challenge.
5. It's fun to talk about your city after the game ends! ("Your city is so full of swords, armor, sweat, and steel that you don't even have the space for the bath").

Cons:
1. May feel stale if players prefer a more "strategic" game that feels like a more long term game.(It's just isn't what this game is about)
2. May feel unfair/boring once players decide that going for the other 2 victory conditions is impossible or considerably harder compared to going for the usual victory condition(Points victory).

My partner seemed to enjoy this a bit more than 7 Wonders 2p with the dummy player, but I honestly preferred the original.  The different card layouts during the ages were interesting enough, and the way the prices were set by your opponents' tableaus was unique, but at the end of the day I preferred the outright draft-then-pass of the original game.  The fact that the game could potentially end before all three ages were played seemed a bit odd and I wasn't a huge fan.  I won't be rushing to try this again, but would be hesitant to give it a bad rating after this single play.

I've played about eight times. I can see myself growing tired of it eventually, but for now, it's a lot of fun. It's easy to teach and fast to play. We begin many game sessions with this one to get the synapses firing.

Several months later, I'm adding more commentary. I think I'm up to about twenty plays (many not recorded on the geek). We are still beginning many two person game days by playing. It's still enjoyable. I've considered getting the expansion, but have resisted as I don't see view it as a good value. Let me know if you disagree and think it is a must have add on.

I'm going to lessen its rating to 7.75, but I still enjoy it.

Very appealing — what a great design! Like its older brother in being fluid and fun, but with the revised approaches to science and the military, and a far cleaner graphic design, I suspect I like it better (for 2-player).

Since I had played 7 Wonders, picking up the modifications for this two player game was easy.  This game also includes some improvements, such as stand-out linking symbols instead of small hard to see building names.  I felt the handling of Science 
 is an improvement because it cuts out the scoring some newbies found confusing.  Also the Military attack is simplified, which I like because that was how I won my first game!  Card drafting demands planning ahead due to face-up/face-down cards.  I feel this is a more strategic game than 7 Wonders, because I have more control with 1 opponent rather than with maybe 4 with whom I have no direct contact.
     Wonder boards came severely warped, which was a disappointment although does not effect play.
     I prefer this game over 7 Wonders.

I love this game, originally bought it as a solution to not having a stable enough group to play a full game of 7 Wonders but still wanting to be able to enjoy the experience once in a while.
Unfortunately it doesn't quite scratch that same itch, but it's an excellent game on its own, and I'd recommend it with or without the ties to 7 Wonders.
Being 2-player, it feels much more harshly competitive than the main game does, and this can lend to some interesting scenarios. For example: as in the base game you can choose to build, burn, or build a wonder with a card each turn. I've had a game where almost half of an entire age was burned by someone so dead-set on a military victory that was simply focused on keeping me from getting victory and military points.
Overall I'd gladly recommend this to anyone who loves the base game but has trouble finding time for everyone to get together and have a nice full game of it going, it won't fill up an evening as readily as the main game will but it'll provide a nice starter for a game night as it's lightweight and easy to set up and play.

Contrary to many, I do prefer the original to this. I feel you get more opportunity to pick a strategy and carry it out, whilst in Duel you are more often being reactive and tactical. But on its own merits it's still a great, quick playing 2-player game. My rating may change with more plays.

I'm not 100% sure if I like this more than its older... brother?
Nevertheless, I'm pretty sure I'm enjoying this as much as I'd like to enjoy any new board game in my collection (which is say a lot). As a two player game (as such this is designed for) and as some kind of "filler" (although I don't love that word) this game is fantastic.
I sincerely don't get why some reviewers say they don't feel the interaction here... What!? I mean, what do they mean!? The interaction in 7WD is its spine! Each and every move you make should be done in a way that interacts, negatively and directly, with your opponent's interest or, surely, I bet you're playing this the wrong way.

There's the Science path to victory... there's, also, the military way: you cannot forget the game is winnable by whichever of these methods, but, most important, you should never forget to deny your opponent the path to victory thru any of them!

There are the Wonders, there are the playing cards distributed in patterns showing some pieces of information, putting out of sight, at the same time, other pieces...

Brilliant design, great game experience for two players!

(Well, I guess I must admit I'm 99% sure I like this more than its older...)

RATING: 8
For what it is (a quick, 2-player filler game), it's remarkable.  Every decision has a cascading effect on what you and your opponent are capable of, and an effect on how you and your opponent view the situation.  The players can also not think about it so much and just play the game.  It's as light or heavy as the player's want it to be.

My wife, who is not a gamer, enjoyed it during our trial play.  I was able to setup, teach, and complete a game with her in under 30 minutes.  She said she'd liked it and would like to play it again.

I should also note this is a game I feel the need to sleeve the cards as they are flimsy and bowed.  I'm not a fan of sleeving, but I simply have to in this case.

Nagyon jópofa ez a kártyavívős alapmechanika. Rengeteg jó ötlet van benne, lenyűgöző hogy sikerült egyszerre megcsinálni azt, hogy nagyon hasonlít is az elődre, és teljes más.
Viszont sajnos egyensúlybeli problémák előjöttek már két játék után is. A zöld győzelemre tényleg nulla esély van. A piros is inkább csak fenyegetés, de az talán még nincs is baj. A kártyák kikaparása a másiknak jókora szerencsefaktort visz a játékba. Kár ezekért, mert amúgy tényleg kivételesen szuper játék lehetne. Így csak jó.

The Duel version is a conversion of the original 7 Wonders into a package better suitable for two players. Even though the central mechanism has been swapped out entirely there are enough similarities that those who already know its big brother will feel right at home. The  zero-sum nature of the two-player duel and the added instant win conditions add a bit of spice to the otherwise rather sedate proceedings. All in all, in does fairly well what it says on the tin.

An amazing 2 player game, with many ways to win. Each decision feels momentous as it will potentially unlock or limit the cards your opponent can buy.

For a simple game, it has many strategies. Economic blockade of resources, forcing your opponent to pay tons of gold for a structure; generating coins through trade structures; forcing your opponent to counter military or scientific breakthroughs.

Amazing. I enjoyed the big brother game, especially for its decision making to time played ratio even with many players because of simultaneous drafting. Unfortunately, my game group didn't love 7 Wonders, but, we were floored by 7 Wonders Duel. It's a near perfect package of strategy, theme, progression, rising tension and important decision making without AP. Very very highly recommend. The hype is justified, and this from someone who gives 7 Wonders a 7 rating.

The best 7 wonder game! A 7 wonder game for real gamers
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
7 Wonders definitely scratches the 7 Wonders itch, but for two! It is quite different in the way the card drafting works, but the set collection is very much the same. There are enough differences to make this a very interesting game- specifically the card drafting "pyramid" mechanic. I'm not a big fan of alternate auto-win scenarios in point-based games (and Duel has two of them) but I can understand why they were introduced and as long as they are balanced then I think they are fine. More plays will get this figured out. Also, the luck of the draw can be killer every now and then. Of course, you can do your best to force your opponent to take a card so that you can take the card underneath, but sometimes the perfect card that is hidden is revealed and swings the game. But this is often feels like risk management rather than blind luck, so no real worries. The rulebook was also not great, leaving out some important details (like Guild rules) unless you read the card summaries at the end. And those points are poorly translated to boot! But finer sticky points aside, a very good game which I'm sure my impression will grow as I play!

INITIAL IMPRESSION
Such a great 2p drafting game. I've always liked open (rochester) draft and this game does it in a very clever and thematic way.

The game really draws out the feeling of 7 wonders with the military, science, culture ways to win along with the wonders themselves. It's so fast and easy to play but offers a lot of replay-ability with how the cards come up, who goes for what and just the very tactical nature of the game is right up my alley.

I can't wait to get in more plays of this one.

MORE PLAYS:
Game continues to be solid but the variability in the cards is starting to get samey and there aren't as many tactical options at times. Expansion with more cards would be a welcomed addition but I'm not sure if that might unbalance the distribution between science/military/culture. Currently I feel science is too hard to go for

EXPANSION:
A must imo to help break up the deterministic card acquisition once extra turn wonders aren't available. This tactic extra option to do something while not removing a card from the pool is huge. The pantheon itself is avg but I do appreciate that it makes scientific victory more of a possibility (it's almost impossible in the base game against someone paying attention)

I like the guilds more than the Temples but I understand why they changed it (they could be more swingy)

Light euro card game - rework of the parent 7 Wonders game into a 2 player duel - get some resource cards and then build VP. Luck of the draw can be a significant factor in the first half of the game and can largely determine the winner. The game has a couple of alternate paths to victory so players need to be alert to how the resource engine is developing and try to react as early as possible. Getting the appropriate resource cards early means you have the best chance at any of the victory conditions of course but the game plays quickly so not a huge problem - reset and try again.

All the bits are very good.

A very nice implementation of the core 7 Wonders mechanisms, in a 2 player game that works! I feel like I'm playing 7 Wonders while I play this, but a very tight, somewhat constrained version. I might like it a little better than the full game due to the fact that it's easier to see what your opponent is up to since you "draft" from a common pyramid of cards as opposed to separate hands. Good game for two!

Great game, with much more direct interaction than the normal 7 Wonders, since every card I take is taken from my opponent, but grants him access to other cards. Furthermore the possibilty to directly win the game by science or military builds up great tension during the whole game and prevents the players from just gathering as many victory points as possible.

Opinion: good implementation of his Big Brother for 2 players. I liked the first impressions of the game, nice interaction, different ways of getting victory points. However I feel that many times during a game you have almost no decisions to take, just follow the less worst choose you can make. Overall I like the game and find it enjoyable

I've not played the original 7 Wonders, so can't make a comparison between the two or comment on whether this makes up for the shortcomings of the original game's 2-player mode, but I was still excited to get to know Duel on its own terms. I can't help but admire how perfectly designed this game is. It really forces you to think on your toes and pull in lots of different directions. For example, even if you weren't planning on being militaristic, if your opponent *is* then you'll have to play at least a couple of military cards (or at least junk them to take them out of the game) to stop your opponent gaining a military victory. However, in spite of its technical brilliance, it's ended up being one of those games I really like but don't quite love. I think the main flaw for me is it doesn't quite immerse me in the theme. It still feels just a bit abstract. But for a short, simple game it's certainly entertaining and has great replayability value, so it's perfect as a quick "filler" Eurogame.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Clearly people are enjoying this, but I just don't understand the appeal. The layout is much too constrained, and does not serve as a good substitute for drafting. Most turns will present exactly one obvious "choice." There just isn't any room to make interesting maneuvers or plans, and it's the random layout of the structure that decides your fate. Truly a scripted game with almost no player agency.

7 Wonders Duel also seems unnecessary, because the two-player version of the original 7 Wonders is outstanding! I think people see "neutral player" and think that it signals some kind of kludgy workaround. But the battle to manipulate the neutral city makes for a more layered, more skillful, and more exciting game (compared to a multi-handed game of 7 Wonders).

Replayed this game after some time. Last game had a lot of tension, but I wonder if someone is set to do the military victory, and has the wonders to back it up, if he can be stopped. Scientific victory still out of reach.

Excellent two player drafting game that is more than just a stripped down version of 7 Wonders. I really like that there are three possible endgame triggers, and how fast the turns go. When learning we were meant to play "just one game", and suddenly played three.

I usually don't like small cards, but I'm glad they used them because it would take a ridiculous amount of space on the table.

Fixes my objections to 7 Wonders (including the part where it seats up to 7 and so I end up playing it more than I want to just because people refuse to split into two 3-player games). After 2 plays it has yet to come down to points, though (one science victory and one military) so I wonder how much of the game is a mirage. Hopefully with practice we'll learn to block those?

Pros:

 -No text on cards only good understandable symbols
 -3 Ways of winning
 -Card layout is always different
Cons:
 -You have to work forward destroying your Opponent. You will sometimes take buildings just to prevent him from getting them and that's no fun
 -Guilds are too powerful
 -Sometimes you just don't have a choice which card to take
 - technological victory is very difficult

7 Wonders Duel is awesome and has become a go-to 2-player game in my group. I love the tweaks to the 7 wonders system that have been made, from the "Rochester"-type drafting system (visible cards make the game MUCH easier to teach than classic 7 wonders) to the utility of military and science. In particular, I love that science can outright win the game, or at least get you useful technologies. It fits that "building a civilization" feel a little more.

Love 7 wonders: duel, and I am definitely looking forward to the Pantheon expansion!

RATING: 8
Nice simple play but lots of depth, Different win conditions and age structures keep the replayability high. Really has some interesting lines of thought and forces you to be adaptable and switch gears partway through the game. Overall has a very nice flow to it, while still being quite deep.

There've been a lot of very close games of this, usually a Military or Science focus either barely getting there or barely missing and losing to a decisive civilian victory.

Pantheon breaks up the usually smooth flow with a very strategic staccato. The ability to not alter the pyramid is very interesting and opens up lots of additional tactical options. The god effects themselves are unique and interesting. An essential expansion, I'll play with it every time outside of teaching.

An entertaining enough drafting system designed for two players. The pyramid set up allows for an interesting decision on whether to take the best available card at the cost of revealing two options or to take a lesser option in hopes that your opponent will reveal two more options for you. The tableau building is a fine form of set collection and wonders will have nice additions like granting an extra turn. I enjoy the sudden win conditions. They are mostly unexpected to the other player and always lead to both wanting to play another round.

A few months ago, I sat down and started to learn it. It sounded fairly blah. Fast forward to a couple weeks ago, I was running late for a game of colonists and the other two had started this while waiting for me. I got there during the first age, so I watched (and learned). Looked better that I thought. 

The next day my wife and I stopped by the FLGS. It was father's day, so she said she'd play a game with me. I grabbed a copy and played it with her. I think I got the rules right. I found it enjoyable. Not the greatest game, but a decent game.

Later when we were shopping for the kids birthday, she suggested buying it. (but they didn't have a copy in stock)

Csodák háborúja
Kis fanyalgással kezdeném, mert ahogy bejelentették ennek a játéknak a hírét, azt gondoltam, milyen szuper lesz, ha az alapdobozhoz kiadnak egy olyan kiegészítőt, amelynek segítségével a régi kártyákat, csodákat használva 2 játékos is kellemesen szórakozhat (tudod, hogy az alapban is van két személyes játék, de azt nem szeretem – van ilyen). Na nem ez történt.
Az eddig megismert 7 Csoda világon alapulva újabb "pénztárcanyitogató" játék érkezett épp karácsony előtt időzítve (és biztosan tervben van már egy kieg is hozzá).
Aki az alapjátékot ismeri, pár perc alatt megismerkedhet a szabályokkal és indulhat is az első játék. Újoncoknak is könnyen emészthetőek ezen változat regulái, ikonrendszere. Maga a játék is barátságos kis dobozban foglal helyet, bár elsőre meglepő lesz a benne foglalt kártyák kis mérete annak, aki többször játszott már az előddel.
Újdonságként nem csak a játék végi pontozás alapján nyerhet valaki, hanem akár katonai fölényünkkel, akár tudományos ismereteink nagyságával „földbe döngölhetjük” játékostársunkat. A korábban már megismert pénzszerzés és nyersanyag vásárlás is változáson ment át. Csodafronton is eleve néggyel indul mindenki, amiből összesen 7 építhető meg, valamint a csodákban rejlő „újra te következel” képességgel is jól lehet taktikázni, annak ellenére, hogy a játéktéren elhelyezkedő lapformáció egyes kártyáit nem ismered.
Életképes, gyors, 7 Csoda utánérzés játék került ki alkotóik kezéből.
A játék előnyei mellett, azért van mint a „fekete levesbe” is aprítania, bár ezt mindenki másképpen értékelheti. A játékhoz elkészült csodák egyike-másika erősebb a többinél, ha szerencsés vagy és éppen 3-4 olyan csodát sikerül begyűjtened, amelyen szerepel az "újra te jössz” jutalom, annak megfelelő kihasználása esetében "garantált” a győzelem (persze, valakin ez sem segít). A korok kártyái között is találhatunk a többinél hasznosabb lapokat (pölö az első körben a 4 aranyas sárga lap, kombózva a raktáras sárga lapokkal a későbbi fordulók során egy-egy lap eldobásakor több aranyat hozva a „konyhára” rendkívüli előnyt jelentenek). Akinek ezzel nincs gondja, bízvást élvezi a játékot, plusz mivel a játék világsiker, így a kiadásra kerülő kiegészítőiben ezt már orvosolni lehet (más kérdés, hogy miért vegyek meg egy kiegészítőt a játék balanszolásához). A többieknek meg van más.
A játék mindenképpen jó, bár a BGG toplistán belüli előkelő helyezése "picit” túlértékelt. Annyira azért nem hagyott mély nyomot bennem. Magam az alapjátékot jobban szeretem.

I shouldn't be surprised by this game but I am. It's way better than I thought it would be. This plays super quick and I LOVE the change introduce to military and science. I love the fact that a player can win the game before the end with Military supremacy or with Science domination. This adds an extra layer that you have to look up to what your opponent is doing to try to prevent him from achieving any of these victories while trying to do the same and gather enough victory point to win in the end if the game reaches its normal conclusion.

A Lot of great design decision which brings a game every has played and love and bring it even higher. I think I like Duel More than the original game because it's more tactical, less random and more personal.

Muy buena conversion a 1vs1 del 7Wonders original. 

en algunos detallitos es diferente (por ejemplo ahora el ciclo con cartas de ciencia maneja 7 simbolos, no 3), pero basicamente viene a ser "lo mismo". 

Tiene un (en mi opinion personal) pequeño defecto, y es que hay varios posibles finales de partida antes de llegar al conteo de puntos, lo cual en mi opinion le resta cierto punto con respecto al original, ya que obliga a jugar mas agresivamente. 

igual de aconsejable que el original, para una circunstancia que en el original quedaba "en el aire".

*update*
After some more plays, I have to lower the rating, as the actions are pretty much obvious and luck is taking over to decide the game. Still a fun game, but not as great as I thought at first. It needs more diversity to become one of the best 2 player games.

First play-through. Took a bit of time to set up and then figure out what all of the symbols meant. But then things started swinging along fairly quick. Looking forward to a second game.

Turns out we may have been playing a few minor things wrong. Will have to adjust in our next game.

世界の七不思議を二人用としてプレイすると、軍事力の意味合いが大きく変わることになっていたりと、バランス面で考えることが多くあった。
そこを変更し、しかしカードドラフトという七不思議らしさを残したまま二人用に仕上げてきたのが本作である。
ターンごとに進行するドラフトの最中でも、軍事力や科学力で一定の成果を上げるとゲームの勝敗がそこで決定したりといった緊張感もあり、手番ではその都度勝ちきるための、若しくは負けないための手を検討することになる。

RATING: 7
It starts out as a very interesting game but you may get disappointed when it ends. 
One of the goals (and maybe the most common one) is to amass the most victory points and I feel like they are not allocated where they should. It feels like the game is punishing you for making smart choices, such as building more Wonders, instead of just getting as many often free buildings as possible, for example. That makes it demotivating, in my opinion.
However, you can win with a military or scientific win instead, which makes the point system moot. The fact that there are different ways of winning makes it interesting so I still think that this game is a very nice game to play.

RATING: 8.5
An intriguing game about 7 wonders in a two-player battle.

The mechanics are different though. Now you will have 3 ways of winning instead of just counting victory points. Either win by collecting 6/7 different science symbol cards, win by total domination over your opponent in war points or win by traditionally having most VP at the end of the game!

Instead of drafting cards, players now select cards from a unique pyramid layed-out cards. Players in turn select a card to either play and own the resources, science cards or go up the war track or gain VP. Alternatively, players may complete wonders by tucking cards taken from the pyramid under their wonder to indicate that they completed them. Lastly, players can discard cards to collect money. Choose wisely as your action will affect your opponents stategy too!

I love this game. My best two player game :)

Takes all those things that make 7 Wonders great and improve them, at the same time making them a tight 2 Player experience. One of the greatest 2P games i've ever played. The fact that the game can end even before the final scoring keeps you at your toes all the time, you have to be ready for everything.

Mad props to Antoine Bauza for remaking his most famous game. I love the original 7 wonders and this is just more mad love. I really like how war is now important. I was beat out by my BF for war when in the original 7W game, I never had to worry about war and just went science all the way. Definitely getting more plays out of this one.

RATING: 8.22
Wonderful two player game.  In the two games I've played I won 65-64 on VP and won via science on the second to last turn.  In the science victory I most definitely would have lost if we went to VP.

The game seems very balanced and the drafting pyramids seem to keep the game fresh.  I could see the game getting stale after a while since you are only using 20 of the 23 cards for each age.  Would love to see an expansion for it adding a few more cards per age.

Great implementation of its parent game. I feel the relationship between cards and their building costs is a bit less rigid (seems easier to do whatever) but the drafting mechanism is genius. 

That said the game can be vicious and very prone to negative play, especially with Pantheon. Most games are fun but maybe one in 4 leave a particularly sour end, with the game decided by a couple of hate moves or ended earlier with a military/science victory, which just never feels satisfying. Loving couples tread lightly

Oddly enough, an improvement on the parent game, "7 Wonders", by adding the ability to win outright through military might or scientific achievement in addition to the original 'points salad'.

Two player drafting before this game was a pretty boring affair.  This game does it in a very engaging manner, forcing a player to weigh not only the options for their own tableau, but what they are leaving or revealing for their opponent.  The theme is very 7 Wonders, but it's an engaging experience all around.

A great implementation of 7 Wonders into a two player game. Works very well and has two of my favorite designers at the helm. It's not just a simple "7 Wonders 2 player variant," but a unique, tight game that is easy to teach with multiple paths to victory. Great game, one of the best of 2015.

My main gripe is the game does not have enough variability with just the base game. However Pantheon did release for this game, but I no longer own the game. Sadly got rid of the game before it came out, can't comment on it, but I heard it changes the game up quite a bit.

This game is growing on me. I think I'm enjoying it more because of familiarity with the cards. Not sure I like the short Science or Military victory games that much, but they are pretty rare anyway and the tension of one keeps you aware of your what your opponent is doing. Really like the smart insert as well.

The game is just a bit fiddly in some aspects. Also wish the wonder cards would be thicker, though. I think I rate the original slightly higher than this.

RATING: 8.75
Probablemente el mejor juego de 2015, pero casi con total seguridad el mejor juego diseñado en exclusiva para dos jugadores. Desde luego, me parece muchísimo mejor que el original, al que tiene similitud sólo en el aspecto gráfico.

En lugar de un draft de cartas tradicional (toma 1 de un grupo de cartas y pasa el resto a tu compañero), las cartas se toman de un "mercado común" en forma de pirámide situado entre los dos jugadores en dónde algunas cartas no se pueden obtener por estar cubiertas por otras que, hasta que no son obtenidas por los participantes, no "liberan" las que tienen debajo. Por si fuera poco, la mitad de las cartas de la pirámide están ocultas, desvelándose a medida que los jugadores escogen las anteriores.

Además, hay condiciones de victoria alternativas a la de "gana el que más PV´s haya obtenido", por supremacía militar (una especie de "tira y afloja" en un tablerito aparte que ocasiona problemas al que va perdiendo y otorga PV´s al que gana cuando la partida acaba) y la supremacía científica (que la consigue el jugador cuyas cartas verdes muestren seis símbolos científicos distintos)

Me gusta que para tratarse de un juego tan sencillo, haya tantas estrategias distintas: bloqueo económico del contrincante, forzar al contrario a pagar cantidades ingentes de dinero por una estructura, generar dinero a través de estructuras de las cartas de comercio, forzarle a contrarrestar tu poder militar o algún hito científico...

PROS: Tiempo de preparación inicial adecuado, rápido de jugar, interactivo, estratégico y táctico. Cada forma de conseguir la victoria tiene su propio sistema (no son tres meros registros de PV´s)

CONS: Cartas demasiado pequeñas. Victoria por supremacía científica difícil de conseguir, así que se convierte más en una opción que debemos evitar al contrario más que en una opción que se pueda conseguir. El reglamento deja de lado las reglas de los gremios, que sólo leyendo el índice de cartas, te enteras de su funcionamiento. Tengo la sensación que las partidas se deciden con mucha frecuencia durante la era I cuando tienes un golpe de suerte y llega la carta de recursos que necesitas.

Di 7 Wonders conserva la struttura di base e quella semplicità che ne hanno decretato il successo.

Una guerra in punta di fioretto.

Neutral - on occasion.

Despite the similarities with the original game, I am amazed by the novelty of this game: the new mechanism with acquiring cards, military back-and-forth & rewards of collecting Tech(green) cards... almost something new on every aspect.

However, I suspect the variability, with basically same opinions of the base game of 7W. I feel that the Tech line is in general too weak and make game space collapse too fast just after few plays.

Very, very good! The general consensus is right. Muy buen juego para dos jugadores. Cada jugador debe construir un tableau (llamémosle ciudad) con cartas disponibles en una pirámide. Algunas cartas están visibles y disponibles, otras no. La selección es parte de la estrategia, porque cada jugador debe estar pendiente a lo que el oponente va formando y lo que busca. Hay que manejar recursos porque así se pagan las cartas que construyes en tu ciudad. Un mecanismo incorporado en los turnos te permite adquirir poder militar o cultural, que son formas de ganar el juego antes del final: supremacía militar o cultural. Juego genial, tenso y divertido que te mantiene concentrado hasta el último turno.

I've never actually played 7 Wonders. However, 7 Wonders Duel is quite literally the perfect 2 player game. My girlfriend and I have had some great plays of this and it's a constant go to when it's just the two of us.

Does a really good job of making 7-wonders work for 2-players.  My wife wasn't a fan; felt it compared poorly to Race for the Galaxy.  Neighbors have loved it though.

RATING: 6.1
Good 2 player game. Still better than the original one. But when two experienced player competed, no sciencific or war victory is available. Luck-based, not much alternate choices, just take that action and much pre-scripted. It is too obivous to guess who is about to win in the second age.

Awesome game. I played this lots of times with my gf and she won about 90% of the games. (Most of the time she won with just a few points more). But I really love 7 Wonders Duel. It is so much fun playing it even if you lose at the end. In my opinion the Pantheon expansion is a must have. It adds variety to the game with the pantheon mechanism and I like that.

Love this 2 player implementation of 7 Wonders. No dummy player required! You really have to spread out and do a little of everything if you don't want to lose quickly. Can be fairly 'mean' since you can hate draft and have the army mechanic, so it might not be for every couple.

RATING: 4
I want to love this game but despite the great theme and production values the gameplay is badly broken. The drafting mechanic can favour one player with no recourse for the other, leading to a "railroaded" outcome from the first turn. It also allows arbitrary hostile player actions with no cost for being hostile. This can mean a player is left unable to compete for the second half of the game. Both the drafting (which is the crux of the whole game) and the sabotage ruin the fun of it.

Losing can be fun when you're outplayed, losing due to sabotage or run-away victories are definitely not fun, and yet I still want to love it. Most annoying!

Very smooth, dynamic and enjoyable 2-player game.

It's lighter than original '7 Wonders' so I've welcomed the expansion with open arms.
The variety (random discard of wonders, era cards and science tokens before each game) is programmed in the base game, but still - more of it was needed.

EDIT: SUCH a shame that military and scientific victories are achievable so rarely...  It really limits the strategies in the (base) game...

Definitely strictly worse than regular 7 Wonders (though I've not tried that one 2p). In place of drafting cards there is a common pool of which only some are available. It felt like through no real effort on my part I was able to make it so my opponent often only had one possible card to pick which would reveal something to give me a lot of options. I got the science victory but it didn't really feel earned at all. It seemed too easy to degenerate into one player not really having any options and then luck of the draw becomes a major factor.

- Makes you think you outplayed your opponent, but everything is binary, obvious and scripted (not much alternate choices).
- Luck-based.
- Pantheon expansion is required, really.

RATING: 10
I have played this game over 40 times now and I still look forward to the next game. The game is easy to teach, plays quickly, and is well balanced. While there are only three ways to win, you cannot just pick a single strategy and go with it every time. You really need to use your Wonders to your advantage while playing the cards the game gives you. I think I have had an even split of win conditions with military slightly lagging the others. This is one of two games in my collection that gets a 10.

PRO: 
I enjoy the Duel aspect of the game. You feel in constant competition with your opponent. In larger games of 7 Wonders, that feeling wasn't as great. I felt I was mostly picking what is best for me, with some thought toward blocking other players from getting certain cards. Duel felt more focused, and you made more decisions based on the strategy and game play of your opponent. (I think this partly was due to the two non-victory-point win conditions that we added)

CON:
I still feel, as with the base game, that the randomness of the cards can in some situations outweigh a good strategy. For Example, sometimes the card you need, or that your opponent needs, is randomly opened up on your opponents turn, allowing them to take it rather than you. Obviously there is some manipulation of cards, but I still felt the level of randomness and chance of the layout of the cards, though not extremely distasteful, was not my favorite.

RATING: 6
A civilization building game (though on the abstract side), players take turns selecting cards to build their city in the hope of being able to construct wonders and earn points.  Victory also possible through science or military domination, it is a two-player only game that is streamlined into a sequence of choices that constantly force the player to weigh advantages and disadvantages.  Sometimes it's beneficial to trash a card that would help your opponent rather than take a card that would benefit your own city, and sometimes you have to accept the fact your opponent will get some advantage in order for you to get your own.  Some people complain the cards are small, but for me they fit the size of the game (and box).  Haven't played this game a huge amount, so still don't know how playable it is long-term.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (December 2015)

My desire to Play 7 Wonders: Duel was rather low. The reason was that, although I enjoyed 7 Wonders for a while in the past, I felt it was very repetitive so I ultimately sold my copy of the game and I feared this one will be the same. However I really enjoyed 7 Wonders: Duel, it has easy rules, it has a similar flavor than its parent game, it plays fast and it does offer (somewhat) interesting decisions (namely which card to buy but this decision can have far reaching consequences). If you have played 7 Wonders before, the explanation can be done under 5 minutes because they share many traits.

I LOVE that there are 3 ways to achieve victory, the usual VP approach, a  military victory or a scientific one so, even if one player is losing badly, he still have the chance to turn the tables and win the game. Also like the way the cards are arranged in each age. You can see some, some are hidden so you can plan a bit (a plsu) but also there is lots of uncontrollable luck (a dislike).

Bottom line, I liked Duel and I prefer it over 7 Wonders. I’m still not sure if I will buy it but it is certainly a possibility. I want to play it again soon to see if it can continue to hold my attention but perhaps it is too light for us right now. Its best feature is, by far, its short playtime.

If you are expecting a light, gimmicky repackaging of the parent game (as some such reincarnations are), you will be severely disappointed. 7W Duel stands on its own extremely well. The face up/face down/reveal-as-you-go mechanic is an innovative approach, enhanced by the ability to take a consecutive turn contained on many of the Wonders. The alternate victory conditions mean that instead of just trying to accumulate more points than your opponent, you must remain alert to the possibility that your hard-earned stack of civil buildings could be undone by a few science or military cards. While gameplay can feel a bit repetitive and the placement of cards can limit the decision space (many times the best move is obvious, giving the game a scripted feel), this is the finest of the 2p reimaginings of larger games that I have played.

Instantly enjoyed this game on my first play. Feels a bit more strategic than 7 Wonders because you can see some of the cards coming and do some forward planning. Most of the scoring mechanics are similar to its parent game, but military uses a push-and-pull "Duel" type mechanic. I have to say, I usually hate that absolute form of shifting valuations in duel games, but here for some reason it works. I suspect this is because it is one aspect of the game, but not the most important. The fiance enjoyed this one as well, which means it will probably materialize in the house soon...

My fear with this one is replayability. I could see it dropping a point depending on how it holds up. The good news is, I'll probably play it enough to find out.

Good, quick filler but surprised to see it rated so high on BGG.  I would give it just a 7, same as its progeny, 7 Wonders, which was actually alot more innovative when it first came out as opposed to this game, which is largely derivative.  Rating based on 15 ~ 20 plays thus far.

I enjoyed this much more than 7 Wonders.  The sudden-death victory conditions keep you on you toes.  Clever card drafting system for two-players, which creates a tension between how much you want to draft a card versus making cards available to your opponent.  its possible that after repeated plays that this would become a top 5 or 10 two-player game for me.

Great two-player game. I think I prefer the open drafting used in Duel versus its big brother, 7 Wonders, as long-term planning is possible and necessary and decisions become more important (i.e. should I reveal something new, discard what he wants, or take what helps me the most?). This interactivity exists in the original but is at the forefront here. The possibility of an instant victory also looms large.

This is a 10 because it's my favorite. I occasionally go back and re-rank my games so that they are in order from favorite to least. My favorite gets a 10.

I understand it's more simple than most of the highly rated games, but that's part of the reason I love it. It still has multiple paths to victory and my wife and I can play it a few times in an evening. She also loves it the most too. The expansion only makes it better.

Love the card "display" used to simulate drafting mechanics. Love the Military tug-of-war. Love that they didn't nerf science while also making it more obvious when a player is running away with a science victory. It is a much more competitive game, though, with a bit more "take that" than vanilla 7 Wonders. And while the immediate victory conditions are cool, it does limit your options slightly as each player kind of HAS to play that game and then see what they can do around the edges if it goes down to points.

Base game alone is an 8; bumps up to a 9 when played with the Pantheon expansion. 

I was a fan of the original 7 Wonders, but was dismayed that you had little to no effect on anyone not seated directly next to you. Which also meant a fair amount of down time at the larger play counts. In 7W:Duel however, [i]every[/i] action you take has an affect on your opponent. You also can't just ignore the military, as it's no longer just a way for your neighbour to score points, but one of two special victory conditions - both of which make for some surprising and exciting conclusions. You are forced to constantly adjust and monitory what your opponent is doing - which makes 7W:Duel so much more engaging on every level than it's predecessor. It's a solid, beautiful game that - despite its limited number of cards - always [i]feels[/i] like it plays out differently depending on the available cards, something that again can't be said of the original which starts to feel samey after a number of plays.

The Pantheon expansion further evolves the system by adding an additional option on your turns (from the 2nd era onwards), where careful planning of the card draft can be interrupted by purchasing a god instead. This minor fold throws a wrench into some of the more calculating aspects of the card draft, not to mention the advantages these gods provide. It extends playtime [i]slightly[/i] which may or may not be an issue, depending on your tastes. I would always prefer to play with Pantheon, but when introducing the game to new players I will avoid it as it's an expansion that's better enjoyed with respect to how it improves on the original system.

The two-player rules of 7 Wonders were a bit of a strain. They obviously were an afterthought to increase the marketing appeal. After one session with them I never tried them again.

7 Wonders: Duel manages the feat to improve an already excellent base game into an outstanding two-player version that still feels like its parent but plays quicker and feels leaner while reducing the luck factor. My only issue with it is that it has to compete in a much tougher field of competitors than 7 Wonders that was one of the few games feasible for a large game group of 6+ players while not sidestepping to party games.

Easier to set up for two than base 7 Wonders, card drafting changed, however the game still has similar feeling. I enjoyed the cards drafting from the pyramid. You can choose the card, which is better for you or deny one, which is good for your opponent as in 7 Wonders. But you can also choose a card which doesn't increase choice to your opponent, or which doesn't reveal a card, which is good for your opponent. You have to constantly think about it. It is definitely a better game for two.

Lengviau pasiruošti žaisti, negu originalų 7 Woders, kortelių pasirinkimas pakeistas, bet žaidimas vis dar yra pakankamai panašus. Man patinka kortų rinkimasis iš piramidės. Gali, kaip 7 Wonders, pasirinkti kortą, kuri tinka tau arba tą, kuri tinka varžovui, kad jos negautų jis. Kita vertus, gali rinktis kortą, kuri varžovui nesuteiktų daugiau pasirinkimo ar kuri nepadarytų prieinamos varžovui geresnės kortos. Nuolat reikia apie tai mąstyti. Tikrai geresnis žaidimas dviems, negu 7 Wonders.

Quicker to play than 7 wonders. Setup takes a little bit of time. My first "2-player only" game that started the trend for me and my brother! It was a great game and we played it non-stop for a while.. until I discovered other 2 player games. Based on my experiences, buying yellow cards seems to be a stronger strategy and winning by military is difficult. Nonetheless, very fun game.

This is a great game! Love the mechanics that are changed from regular 7 Wonders to make it playable as a 2 player game. Still feels like 7 Wonders even though play is completely different. It moves quickly, especially in the first Age while things are free, cost little, and you can't afford to build wonders yet. Third Age took a little longer, but still not bad. It does, however, feel like blue cards are more vital to a win via VP in this game than in 7 Wonders, but from only 1 play, I could be wrong. Very fun!

I like how quick this game can play and still give you some meaningful decisions (while sometimes you're forced to do an action because otherwise it can lose you the game). The drafting aspect is nice with the layout style and deciding which wonders to take can already telegraph your strategy to your opponent. The double turn actions are really strong.

I haven't played the expansion yet, but I'm looking forward to what it adds.

Extremely disappointing after multiple plays.  More tactical than strategic, 7 Wonders style, but with MUCH more limited options, and if your opponent manages to get early war cards or science cards, both paths that can lead to an early/instant win condition, you have NO choice but to do the same and then you're just playing catchup. Even when we forewent every combat card, the random layout of the resources going to one player swings every game.  That combined with the extra punishment of increasing the resource prices after being denied the resource cards is just too much and made the second half of each game empty.

More tactic than strategic with many layers of confrontation: military/science track, wonders construction, card draft and resource management.

Excellent 2p version of 7 Wonders. Problem is, that's a bit of a crowded market. Thankfully, it had the 7W brand name to get it noticed.

Perfectly cromulent feather-light 2p, but a tactical game of gotcha and not much more. Even if I did still have an appetite for the medium-light Euro, I'm not sure I'd totally understand the enthusiasm for this one.

The open drafting is way more interesting than the original mechanic in 7 Wonders and the game is overall a better game. More tension, interesting decisions and three paths to victory that feels different. For me there is two main problems with the game: you cannot change strategy in the middle of the game, and both strategies that end the game sooner are kind of "brainless" (work to get some specific cards), which generates a feeling of winning by luck.

Excellent two-player game!  Very happy with this one, and I actually prefer this to the original 7 Wonders game, so far.  Nice and fast, with a clever "drafting" method with some exposed information, and some hidden.  There are three different win conditions, which keep players on their toes, since you can't ignore when your opponent is starting to exploit a strategy that may give them a sudden win.  Fast to play (30 minutes), which is also nice to have for those situations that call for it, since a lot of my two-player games are much longer.

I also got the metal military token, which was originally an Essen 2015 exclusive.  Very nice little addition to the game.  :-)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I like this way more than 7 wonders. The layout that you buy your cards from works to make the decision of which cards to reveal, as well as the risk of turning over unrevealed cards. As someone who likes direct conflict in games, the military track also lends itself to my taste more easily than 7 wonders. A different card layout for each era also adds to the variety and keeps the game from suffering from the sameness that 7 wonders does. While this would not be the case for everyone else, for me it's only downside is the limit of two players. I so wish there was a way of having this cater for more players right out of the box.

I really like this. Although it shares the name, many symbols, and the "universe" of 7 Wonders, this is its own game. It's balanced, offers several paths to victory, and mostly sidesteps the "take that" element common to 2-player victory point games.

Fast paced PVP 2 player card game. You have 3 rounds to gain resources, to build wonders of the world like the Pyramids, or the Hanging Gardens, or even the Great Sphinx. But watch out bc if your opponent decides to overtake you with his growing army and your pile of victory points are no match with an instant win. This is a good game played in the right company. Be sure you understand the rules clearly and let the rules be known by the other player or sour grapes is what will dampen the playthrough.

Okay game which is fun enough but has a lot of randomness as to which cards come out and get turned over.  At this point, I'll gladly play the game to get more experience with it but it isn't something I'm driven to own.  Gameplay pales in comparison to it's parent game.  I need to try the two-player version of 7 Wonders to see how it compares.

RATING: 7
This is a good game, but it does have some annoying flaws:

-The quality of the age cards is quite poor. I don't mind them being small like some people do, but they're paper thin and could easily tear or get creases in them. They remind of the terrible Takenoko cards.

-I like my games' mechanics to really tie into their theme and I don't feel that 7WD's really do. For example, when in history has a civilization ever ruled over another due to science? Probably never. A commerce victory would have made more sense (for example, you win if you say have 30 coin more than your opponent). And it bugs me that you can't stockpile your resources like you can in other games or use your money to buy military. It's a good game, but you can't allow yourself to get too tied to the theme. If you're like me, try to think of it as an abstract game with a pasted on theme.

-I'm not much of a fan of asymmetrical games and it's because no matter how much a designer might say it's been balanced, I just can't believe them. With 7WD that's not a problem except for the wonders and even that's not too much of a problem because you're drafting them, but I don't feel like they're that balanced. For example, most of the wonders that allow you to play again right away are probably better than most of the ones that don't allow you to. And if you don't know the game well, you can easily draft them poorly and since success in the game is largely tied to your successful building of your wonders I think it's crucial that you draft them well. I would have given them all that power and, if necessary, made their other benefits weaker.

-I understand the expansion solves this problem, but with the base game I feel it's too easy to get put into a position, especially in the third age, where drawing anything is either a bad move or loses you the game. One could say, "you put yourself in that position", which might be true, but it isn't necessarily. While I'm sure many people like this aspect of the game, I think the base game would be better if you were allowed to pass, but not twice in a row. So if your opponent also passes you'd still have to make that bad move, but at least there'd be the chance that your opponent might decide it was in their best interests not to also pass. From the reviews of the expansion I've watched and read, the expansion might be worth it for the simple fact that it allows you to not take a card.

-The insert is garbage. Even with nothing else in the box, but the insert, the lid still won't fit over the box! Yeah, you could easily just throw it out, but I think this and the quality of the age cards just shows how disinterested Repos is in quality. I would think twice about getting another Repos game.

Overall, there are some good to great things about this game (the temples of the cards with some known and some unknown is absolutely brilliant), but I just think that if they had gone a little farther that the game would be more deserving of all the high praise it gets.

RATING: 6.5
Wow. was I unimpressed by this one. I will play it a couple of more times but in my collection there are at least 50 two player games that I like more.

Reading the reviews and comments I believe there is more to it so it gets more chances. but in my two first games the game practically played itself. And errors were punished . 

Perhaps it has to do with my character. As an Intp I have to keep my options open and because it is a simple game these choices were to obvious.

The two instant winning conditions. Well if someone is strong on military chances are the other one is making it up in science. This sort of balance allthough it is adding tension really doesn't do it for me. The advantage given to the weaker military is a must because if it was different it could be that military ended the game at a start of an era. Science maybe I haven't had a look at the card distribution but it would be definately harder to pull off.
So the advantage of picking the start player by the weaker military is sort of prevent the game from ending catch up mechanism.

edit:
third play started throwing away military for money. Opponent did the same. This made it easier to build the wonders.  Gonna try something different next time.
Rating might go up.

Edit fourth play :
I don't play a lot of games more than 5 times and I am getting there quickly .
This time my opponent who started , did things to cripple me and played subpar for her own score.  She did score a lot of blue buildings and was omnipresent at the markets. I tried science and came one short , because  I couldn't manipulate the turn order because she crippled me in two resources. 
I start to wonder, no pun intended, if the amount of luck is not too high in this one. 
The buildings that she revealed were pretty much worthless to me. Okay at best.
While she got some really nice markets that I needed with next to it a building that required the esources from the market.
I had plenty of wood and stone but apparently these are not needed as much as I thought to build buildings.

Anyway I have seen the science route fail all four times now and the military is a much bigger threat.  
I am just going to read some comments. Play again military and see what happens.

I am not convinced that the best player wins . This has to do with the cards being revealed can be useless or very helpfull.

Nice game. Light, quick and plays smoothly. These are important features of 2 player games in my opinion. The artwork is beautiful and consistent. 
I think there are some balance issues however. In our games the leading player in every age had a great advantage over the other. It also seems to me like the military advantage should make you lead every age but it's the opposite way, making military buildings rather useless. I hope The Pantheon expansion fixes this.
Or maybe we can't play it like we should... :)

7 Wonders, two player mode is a great two player game. It get tense when you want a card for yourself and ultimately exposing something for the other player. Before it's even shown, you just pray that nothing good is going to appear, but that's unlikely. Also if you do see what could be open, you say to yourself, and mabe out loud that wherever you do it's gonna hurt. There is a great back and forth, like a tug of war trying to out wit the other, to build your wonder, to get the matching symbols, to get the sciences, and to get the military. The only thing have to say is, maybe the regular cards should be bigger, other than that it's a great, somewhat fast, two player game.

Hard to say after couple of games if I like it or not - so this might be a keeper or not. '7 Wonders: Duel' feels surprisingly much like 7 Wonders without the drafting mechanism AND it's of course faster to play. It's quite smooth and nicely designed BUT couple of symbols should be more clear. I'll rate this 6 for now, but it can go up or down after more games played.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
In many ways 7 Wonders Duel resembles its parent game 7 Wonders as over three ages players acquire cards that provide resources or advance their military or scientific development in order to develop a civilization and complete wonders.

What's different about 7 Wonders Duel is that, as the title suggests, the game is solely for two players, with the players not drafting cards simultaneously from hands of cards, but from a display of face-down and face-up cards arranged at the start of a round. A player can take a card only if it's not covered by any others, so timing comes into play as well as bonus moves that allow you to take a second card immediately. As in the original game, each card that you acquire can be built, discarded for coins, or used to construct a wonder.

This is 7 wonders from the beginning to the end, but still lots of good additions and adjustments to make it a valid 2-player game. Bruno Cathala's touches are recognizable like the order you choose your wonders (see Mr. Jack player order) or taking clues from solitaire card games for limiting the available cards (see e.g. S.O.S. Titanic!). Moving the battle marker up and down is fine, the way guilds may benefit the other player is fine, the new - simpler but not less interesting - way for scoring green cards is also fine. Also the game is easier to teach and start playing than 7 Wonders was, as there are no hidden cards in hand and rules are also easier to understand for beginners.
I think it's a very well-designed one and I can just hope some expansions might be in stock to spice up things later...

Aggressive. Really cool looking ahead and calculating what will happen if you take a certain card or forcing your partner to take a certain one.

Very much like 7 Wonders but improved all around. Clever how they got around the drafting for 2 players. Also, it makes cards do more things during the game, as opposed to just being worth points at the end, which adds complexity, interaction and dynamic. Beautiful artwork too!

We like it. It was in our top 10. Love the city-building aspect and the drafting mechanic. Unfortunately, after 15+ plays, we found that often one player will collect all of the resources and leave the other with not a lot of good strategies. It's dropped some but it's still a game we like.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

The different win conditions forces opponents to a bit of tug of war in the sciences and warfare while still building a bit of an engine to buy the high value stuff. The pyramid drafting structure is well implemented. I wonder about replay value after a while but no doubt future expansions are coming.

What a fantastic two player implementation of a beloved game. Other designers take note that this is how you should do it. Playing this game definitely feels like you are playing it's namesake, but at the same time it is almost completely different. The balance is definitely present as both sides race to compete in the various point scoring smorgasbord all the while keeping an eye on their opponents science and military just in case they run away with the game through those means.

RATING: 8
This is so much more enjoyable than playing with a dummy player in the normal 7 Wonders game. This is the rare example of a successful game that has an enjoyable spinoff game. 

This is not a 10 because there is supposed to be a victory condition for science or warfare, but those victory conditions are almost impossible to achieve. I wish they were slightly easier which would make the game even more balanced.

I really enjoy playing this game with my husband.  HOWEVER, I do not like the auto-win game condition regarding having a full set of science symbols.  I shouldn't have to purchase something I don't want, just in order to stop someone else from having it.  If you want to call it an "end game" condition, I'm more okay with that.

RATING: 6
7 Wonders Duel takes place in three eras. In every era you can do scientific developments, strengthen your army and win coins to create a civilization and work wonders. There are three ways to win the game: military domination, scientific domination and civil victory. Military and scientific victories can take place throughout the game. The game will then also end immediately. If at the end of the third era no-one has won the game, the player with the most victory points wins a game in between, if you want to play something that does not take too long.

The candle that burns the brightest burns the shortest, and 7 Wonders' candle burned oh so very bright. It was huge when it came out, and I named it my game of the year, and a couple months later it had vanished. It seemed everyone in my group got tired of it at once and no one seemed to feel the expansions added much except extra faff that gave the game a little more width, but little depth. My copy is long gone, and I'm not sure who else I know still has it.

Nevertheless, I was interested in this, but not enough to drop the cash on it outright. I have a person I regularly play 2p games with, but honestly we're spoiled for choice at this point and have way too many that don't get the the table often enough. I was glad to be able to try out someone else's copy.

I liked this. It distills the essence of the game, translates the drafting in an interesting way, and offers some neat choices. It's certainly better than the 2p variant of 7 Wonders, and moves at a nice pace. Glad I got to try it out.

RATING: 8.6
Fun, quick, game for 2.

I like that its not too mean and there is enough there to balance a simple engine (gray and brown cards), the conflict track (red cards), and the victory points (blue track). 

Enough unique ways to score/win without being too daunting. 

Very good game.

Despite being a game involving purchasing things with wood, stone, etc, it's not fiddly fest.

I'm not entirely convinced that available card structures allow for satisfying strategy, but it does have the interesting choices on most turns thing down well.

I can see why this one is a big hit.  It’s a basic set collection card game, but with enough variables and possibilities to give it a very strong strategic depth.  A Catan-like building mechanic combines with a solid card-drafting system and an interesting layout that lets you play defensively as well as offensively.  It’s also an excellent game for those of us who play a lot of two-player games but are looking for something a little more complex than most card games; it’s got Euro-style strategy in a small, compact, portable form.

It’s very much on point thematically, with beautiful art and a great design, and it’s surprising how much component-wise they manage to get into the small package.  There’s a bit of a learning curve to the rules, but it’s not incomprehensible.  Overall, just an excellent 2-player strategy game!

This one really disappointed me.  I bought it solely based on the high recommendations of others.  Unfortunately this game has a serious flaw.  As you must draw cards that contain resource-producing  abilities, you can paint yourself into a corner (not by choice), if you don't come across the cards you need.  The game is played over the course of three rounds or 'ages'.  The first round seemed to be the best opportunity to get all the resources (clay, stone, wood, glass and papyrus).  I had everything but papyrus.  

That completely screwed me over.  By the end of the first age, I was playing from behind with no hope of recovering.  I do not like games where this is possible.  It would be like your high school soccer team playing Manchester United (but without the bragging rights of saying you played against Manchester United).  Why take a chance on playing a game like this if you can see your chances slipping away?  Once they're gone, this game just becomes a game of motions that you could inevitably lose.    I would consider giving it another chance, but this one just isn't in my wheelhouse.

7 Wonders Duel is a very well designed 2 players only drafting game. The different win conditions brings a new aspect to the series. I love how you display cards on the board so that drafting unlocks certain cards and that not all cards are revealed. The guild cards makes the game even more interesting as you can benefit from an opponent that specialized in a certain type of cards. I enjoy this game way better than the original.

Initial impressions: I'm afraid of replayability of this game since you only remove a few cards from each age. Overall I like it more than regular 7 Wonders. The combination of the game now being zero sum in terms of drafting and having to watch out for science and military victories makes the game seem to have a lot more interaction. I also like how there appear to be more things (at least compared to base game 7 Wonders, haven't played expansions) that have powers that feel less bland than say X gold or some scoring system: for example the science powers, the ability to mess with turn order with the extra turn with your wonders, etc. The spatial placement of the cards also adds another layer of should I take this but reveal these options for my opponent, and where each card appears affecting your tableau might provide the desired replayability. Riding a lot on the coattails on the 7 Wonders brand, but still a very solid 2 player game and if I do end up playing it more and it feels replayable I will bump this up to a 7.

A shorter but not necessarily lighter version of 7 Wonders.  Again, it captures all of the trappings of a Civ game without much of the actual content, but that's balanced against the fact that it's actually fun to play.  A twist on drafting, there's still hidden information and risk with allowing cards to be flipped up.  Great two player balance.

This game, though very simple, provides real fun. Luck has a massive impact on the strategy you'll choose throughout the game and it forces players to suddenly change plans many times. By the way, the engine you build with your cards makes the feel of growth really strong and satisfying.
I quite understimated it during my first play, because its simplicity and the super-quick turns made me think this game was somehow pointless. I really changed my mind playing it for the second time and now I often play it and it' s definitely a keeper.

The score is based on one play but it was incredibly balanced between both of us.  I ended up winning 62 - 61, mostly because I got a trading guild at the end which got me the winning 15 points.  I sold many of my potential buildings early and lost some ground because my competitor got most of the free buildings and I ran out of cash.  Great balance and would play again!

AWESOME medium-weight ancient civilization building game for 2 players. A lot of ways to win and score points, very well balanced, some luck - mostly strategy, half solitary - half interaction, good theme, highly recommended for couples who don't shy away from a duel.

Very nice tableau-building game for two. Direct confrontation is not hugely likely to win you the game, but depending on the card spread actually can be a risk worth threatening.

Interesting game. It plays very quickly and is tense due to sudden death conditions. There's also some decent replay value as the pyramids are always different and the science tokens bring in variability too.

This game is SO different from 7 wonders and that is excellent.  7 Wonders is losing appeal with my gaming group (and because of that with me too), but this game is totally different.  It's fast, it's strategic, and it's 1 vs. 1.  I love this game.  I have noticed that each game, someone seems to get into a pattern where they are forced to choose the worse cards multiple times in a row.  I am still trying to learn how to mitigate this.  I'll enjoy doing that however as I love this game and want to play it often.

Duel is a wonderful implementation of the big brother game on a scale for two players. There's enough familiar to feel at home and enough different to keep things fresh. The mechanics are sound. I particularly like how the MP draft was replaced with an up/down table draft in the 2P version. Production quality is quite good. My one criticism in this area is how tiny the cards are. For the price point, I feel the publisher could/should have included full size.

A great translation from the original. I like this better.
Doesn't take up too much space for a game that is about spreading your cards on a table.  The mini card size was a great choice.
3 possible victory conditions all of which makes thematic and game mechanic sense.
Many parts of the game taken from the original so tested and true.

My only complaint I have so far it there could be more to it, could be longer, though IDK how exactly that would do what to the game

RATING: 8
2 player only standalone game based on 7 wonders. You draft single stage wonders, but not cards. You compete for cards in a pyramid, with only access to the bottom row. 2 sudden victory conditions via science and military can make vp irrelevant. Plays in about a half hour.

This is much more enjoyable for me than the original 7 Wonders.  
-There are more paths to victory.  It's extra exciting when you think you can pull off an instant win with military or science. 
-Includes both open and hidden information that influences the decisions you make.
-You have to balance what you take based on what may then become available for your opponent.  Makes for much tougher decisions.
-The wonders make Duel fill a bit more combo-y, especially with the ones that grant a 2nd turn.  Maybe I was never very good at building wonders in the original game?

Initial impressions are good and I see it having quite a bit of staying power.  Plays quickly, which is always a plus.  Don't see it taking over Battle Line as my favorite 2 player only game.  Not quite the same amount of tension is generated in Duel compared to BL.

After watching all the reviews and play through, I had high expectations on this one.

But, when I played it, it was tenser and deeper than I expected. What a good surprise! :)

The alternative paths to victory are easier to accomplish than I thought, so pursuing them is actually very dangerous to your opponent, who will have to watch your steps very carefully in order not to lose.

The game exceeded my expectations and became a hit for me and for my girlfriend. We played it about 7 times in a row.

I tried the original 7 Wonders once. It wasn't explained to me very well. The person ended up taking nearly every go for me as they probably felt it was quicker to do this than actually explain to me what I was meant to be doing so I could play the game. I was there so they could play. It was a bad experience and coloured my opinion of the game. I wasn't that interested in the game before this and I was even less interested afterwards. But I play a lot of 2 player games (Pagoda, Musée, Patchwork, Jambo, Jaipur, Lanterns: The Harvest Festival, Archaeology: The Card Game, Targi, Arboretum, Parade, San Juan, Morels, Biblios, Splendor, Isle of Skye: From Chieftain to King, Wir sind das Volk! I'm looking at you) so when this came along I wanted to try it.

It is good. After the first play of it I thought it would always play out in a similar manner. But as I have played it more I can see some further depth to it. It is an interesting tug-of-war game in which you need to dabble in a little bit of almost everything to firstly stop your opponent from winning, and then, have hopefully done enough to win yourself. 

It works on a very simple rules set. Pick a card from a pre-set card lay out (some are face down, some face up and if a card has no other cards overlapping it turns face up if not already). Similar to the base game there are 3 ages and 3 geometric lay outs for the cards. You then do one of three things with the card you picked. 1/ discard it for money. 2/ Pay/illustrate you have the cost in resources on the card and build it. 3/ Discard it under a wonder to build that.

There is much more than this to it in the free upgrades and special abilities of the cards. But it all works very well and is quick and easy to explain.

I guess it recreates the feelings of 7 Wonders for 2. I'm not the person to ask this, but I can tell you it is a good game and an enjoyable way to spend 30 minutes. All in a nice small box which is always handy! not the best two player game I have by far but it is good.

UPDATE

Still like this game a lot. But I still need to play it a few more times before I can form a final opinion on it. I do worry that possibly familiarity with the cards could dull the gaming experience, but I am no way near that point. Great two player game at the moment and one I would turn to before Jaipur, Jambo, Pagoda and Targi, but that is at the moment. With time we shall see! I have only played 7 Wonders once and didn't have a great experience so if you are holding back because you haven't tried the base game, don't!

Rating based on 2 players.

This addresses pretty much all my problems I had with the original 7 Wonders. Interaction is now more direct, military/trade doesn't depend on your seating arrangement, and there is more strategy as you can look ahead. The plethora of icons remains, but most are easy to understand.  Quick to play.

Traded. I like this game, but I feel no need to own it as the chances of playing it are slim (2 player games that are not incredibly simple to explain are very difficult to get played in my circumstances)

RATING: 8
A great re-implementation of 7 Wonders for 2 players. One thing that always irked me about 7 wonders is that the resource management always felt so tight. You could never do everything you wanted. Duel feels a lot more open. You can do most of what you want to accomplish. Admittedly, this is more of a subjective feeling. A lot of players like the feeling of scarcity, and I normally don't mind it. But I much more prefer being able to accomplish most of your goals, without barely scraping by, and Duel give you that feeling. Aside from that, the rest of the game is great. There is a lot of "in your face" (obviously, given the title), but it's not overwhelming to me. Most of the things you do against your opponent are more in a roundabout way, instead of "give me that, it's mine now". I'd highly recommend this game to gamer buddies who enjoy 7 Wonders.

RATING: 7
Positives: I like the addition of instant-win conditions (military and science), and the card stack revelation is a neat idea: more planning and less chance-based. Trading with bank is also good (though pricing is bizarre thematically-speaking). I also like how free builds are now indicated by icon instead of by text - much better interface!

Negatives: I still find the game more tactical than strategic (often making 2-way comparison choices, and just computing, which means much of the gameplay is simple computation), though the card revelation does mitigate this by adding a nice planning-ahead component which the original lacked. Still a few too many icons for my taste, but better than the original in this regard too.

Conclusion: If you like the original, you'll probably like this one and vice-versa. This one's a bit better if you want more strategy/planning, but in practice it will be decided by player count.

Great two player game. Tight, flawless rules and mechanics. First game was decided by one point. As good as the mechanics are the components sort of suck. The cards are very flimsy and using mini cards seems like a cost cutter. I'm many ways this game is superior to the original 7 wonders but the components make it feel like something less which shouldn't be the case.  Because it's two player it should be tiny and cheaply made?  Still love it and will play often and definately recommend.  But if the cards were even on normal stock this would be a 9 or 10

gives a lot of the feel of the empire building in the full version;  I don't think the card selection mechanic replaces the feel of the draft in the full version, but I still love it and there is strategy here as to what to leave your opponent as far as sub optimal choices, and determining when to take a double selection using a wonder is a big part of the game, in my opinion.

Wish the cards were a little bigger, but I understand why they did it this way or it would be a table space monster.

Bought from Kingslayer Comics 7/3/16.

Although the game is fairly light for us, the quick play time (~20 minutes) and relative depth of strategy makes it a keeper.  I like the pyramid drafting system.  It feels like a more streamlined 7 Wonders experience that's less clunky (due to the modified draft) and with less fiddly end game scoring (I'm looking at you, science).

This would make a great Coffee Shop game.

Rapide, intéressant, pas compliqué. Une excellente déclinaison, que je préfère au jeu original. Le jeu n'offre pas non plus une très grande profondeur, les choix sont limités, parfois assez binaires. Tout de même plusieurs pistes stratégiques envisageables autour des ressources (direct ou achat) et les différentes conditions de victoire (religieux, militaire, points). Ces dernières apportent aussi une bonne tension. L'extension Panthéon permet de casser en partie le rythme de prise de carte et apporte ainsi une couche tactique supplémentaire bienvenue.

Has a very different feel than ordinary 7 wonders. Resources can always be bought off the bank, so buying production buildings is more about blocking ones opponent from being able to get the resources cheaply. Military and science can end the game early - a very welcome addition.

Good:
The game has unique drafting mechanics that works really well and I hope to see the mechanic used in other titles.

Similar to 7 Wonders, the art and component quality are top notch. 

This nails 7 Wonder gameplay in a 2 player format. 

Bad:
A little too "thinky" for me. There is a lot of things to keep track of because a single overlooked/missed card or bit of information can lead to an unavoidable loss. As a result the turns tend to be drawn out while players check their setup, their opponents setup, currently available cards, and do a mental check of the cards that will be uncovered for your opponent for each drafted card.

Unlike, it seems, the rest of the world, 7 Wonders hasn't been a huge part of my life. But we're always looking for a good 2p game.
The good: It's quick, lots of interesting decisions, clever setup.
The not sure: This has more confrontation than I really enjoy.
The bad: Am I the only person who struggles with the rules layout? I think I've worked out how to play, but it was definitely despite the very opaque rules booklet. And we struggled with the score pad. What is meant to go in each row? Again, we think we have worked it out. On the up-side, it is nice to see a space for the date.

After 7 plays, I'm starting to think I'm done with this. We find that the first player has a higher chance of winning, and it seems clear after the first few rounds who is likely to win. There are a number of destructive cards, which I dislike intensely - just as you get your engine rolling, things happen & you have to discard the cards or money you've been saving for that critical next card. I hope I know how to behave at the table, but the game leaves me feeling pouty and petulant. Even when I win! I think this is going to the trade table.

Balanced, tight, representative of the original...by far my favorite two player game.  So well designed; similar to the original, but stands on its own. This two player head-to-head game is more intimate and complex than the larger scale version.  All of our games have been very close and left us wanting more!

RATING: 8.4
I like this game a lot. Also the people I play this with are very enthusiastic. I'm still on the fence which I like better (2 player vanilla 7 Wonders or this). I need to play it more. :)

Edit:
I like the 'normal' 7 Wonders 2-player better than this. Perhaps because I already played that a lot more, but also because I like the mechanic with the hidden hands and the things you can do with the free city better.

The game played very well and strategies developed very soon after becoming comfortable.  I enjoyed this game more than I thought I would.  The game has just the right amount of depth, and strategy opportunities.  The components are well constructed and I look forward to the coming expansion.

I was afraid this would be a cash grab on the 7 Wonders name, but it's not. The gameplay is solid and varies enough from game to game (with the different wonders, green tokens, and card layouts) to keep things interesting. Although most games do not end by military or science victory, the threat is enough to keep players on their toes and possibly be forced into making suboptimal moves.

Aside from gameplay, I like that the box and cards are small, and the insert is perfect.

What sort of a hype is going on here, judging from the ratings? This is just a very simple card grabbing exercise. Cards in pyramid structure, grab what you can. Or grab money. And thrown in some wonders since that is in the name of the game. All in all very light stuff to pass the time.

This game is immense, one of the few new games that totally has lived up to its surrounding hype! The key features are its simplicity vs depth of play and short play time. I actually prefer this to 7 wonders

I think this is a fine game, but probably not the best fit for us because of the importance of denying things to the other player or destroying their cards/money. I very much prefer regular 7 Wonders' more laid-back style of just building your own civilization. This game is too much of a chess-match for me, and I find it too stressful.

One of the best 2 player games I have ever played.  Very well balanced. Our second game, after the first age I was sure that the wife had won and that she would snowball through the next two ages, however in the second age I took a huge lead, destroying a lot of her resources and building all 4 wonders, where she hadn't finished any, and grabbing some progress, that she did not, making me believe that now the game was mine... until the third age, where the wife once again shut me down.  I will gladly play this anytime and am thinking of picking up the expansion soon.

[b]After 21 plays[/b] 

Still room for my rating to rise or fall depending on developing understanding. At the moment, the outcome seems too often decided by lucky draws in phase I, mostly resource cards. 4 of our last 5 games were end-to-end blowouts (which we split 2-2). We've analyzed these blowouts and as far as we can tell, the outcomes were down to lucky phase I draws.

There's still a chance our understanding is lacking in some way, and if we discover that to be so, my rating will probably rise.

A related gripe is military seems too weak. If you don't succeed at a military insta-win (which is hard and getting harder as we improve at the game), then it's a very low ROI source of points. Consequently my opponent and I have almost completely abandoned military as an option. There's still some room to be wrong, however. For example, perhaps someone who's going for a military victory should avoid completing their go-again wonders until phase III, so they can assure getting all the big military cards. That's something we don't typically do, but I've read that can be a valuable tactic.

[b]After 54 plays[/b] 

Liking the game more. We've figured out how to use Age III better so the game is more often won or lost there, and luck is less of a factor (though it's still significant). We've also learned better how to use military/science to force the opponent into uncomfortable choices. 

One thing I don't love about it still: it's very calculational at times, forcing you to do a series of nested net value calculations. That sort of intensive but basic algebra is not my favorite kind of thinking. One nice aspect of these calculations though is that they sometimes reveal counterintuitive valuations, which make for fun "aha" moments.

RATING: 8
Tiene todas las características de un euro basado en puntos de victoria con draft y set collection, estando a la altura de juegos de mayor enjundia. Esas características le dan un incentivo a la planificación a largo plazo. Además, ello se mezcla con mecánicas de tira y afloja como en el combate y en la tecnología. Sin embargo, está muy lejos del carácter solitario de muchos euros. Aquí la tensión es máxima y la interacción también porque cuando juega el adversario, te preguntas se se dará cuenta de la jugadaza que le puede dar una ventaja importante.

El draft mezclando las cartas ocultas y conocidas da mucho juego porque te permite proyectar un poco al futuro y te permite jugar con los turnos previendo que tu adversario no se lleve determinada carta.

Mi único pero es que temo que al jugar muchas veces esté un poco dirigido. Tiendes a hacer movimientos similares. Después de jugar 4 partidas, consigo hacer buenas puntuaciones proviéndome bien de recursos y luego yendo a acumular puntos y contrarrestando que el adversario no pueda hacer los suyos.

Habe das Spiel auf der Spiel 2015 getestet. Mein Fazit nach dieser einen Partie:  7 Wonder für 2 Spieler? Ja genau! Das Regelwerk und auch der gesamte Aufbau wurden genau dafür optimiert. Das ist meiner Meinung nach auch prima gelungen. Die Punkte aus dem Original die mit 2 Spielern gar nicht oder nur sehr leidlich funktionieren wurden gut gelöst. Statt Karten weiterzugeben, werden die Karten eines Zeitalters nun teilweise offen, teilweise verdeckt nach einem bestimmten Muster überlappend in der Tisch-Mitte ausgebreitet. Sobald eine Karte nicht mehr von anderen Karten überlappt wird, wird sie ggf. aufgedeckt und kann von da an von dem Spieler am Zug für eine der üblichen drei Optionen genutzt werden, als Gebäude bauen, abwerfen um Geld zu bekommen oder für den Bau an einem der Wunder. An vielen Stellen sind es nur Kleinigkeiten die angepasst wurden, aber diese Anpassungen sind gut aufeinander abgestimmt und funktionieren in Summe sehr gut. Für Leute die häufig zu zweit spielen eine klare Kaufempfehlung.

My wife will play competitive games, but doesn't usually suggest to play them. I got this because the majority of our gaming is just us two and wanted to give it a shot. First game I won with Military victory and could tell she might be off put by it. I suggested we play the next day and told her to put on her mean face. She won with a science victory. To my surprise, the next day she suggested that we play again. She won with a sneaky Military victory.

So three games in and we are enjoying this. I think that she is currently enjoying being up in the win count. Might be a gateway game into some more competitive games for her.

We play 7 Wonders Duel at least once every couple of weeks. The game play is engaging and there are many paths to victory. Just when you think you have a solid strategy, you see your opponent finding another way to win the game that you didn't account for! We haven't yet played the original 7 Wonders but we've heard this is similar in part, but different enough than it's big brother. 

In all, it's a fabulous two-person game that takes about an hour or so to play. We continually want to find different ways - different paths to victory ... and that what makes this game challenging. I highly recommend it if you want to start learning about collecting wood, clay and other supplies you need to conquest your Wonders - and emerge victorious!

Lovely 2 player game. Tons of interesting decisions. A lot of tension with the different win conditions. It also can play very differently depending on the order of cards and wonders that appear. I've played this game 3 times in a row which is very rare for me to do for any game. A lot of "game" packed into 45 minutes.

Love this game! After many many plays since Jan when I bought this game, I have recently finally won with a Green victory. I have tried for Red so often and failed. It actually put a bit of a downer on the game, being anti-climatic as it feels like it happens so rare that you don't get to score the game up. We ended up just continuing anyway and scoring at the end regardless.

This packs a huge amount in a small package.  Brings home that 7 Wonders feel, but in a much more manageable fashion for 2-players.  I've seen all 3 types of victories.  I only have two concerns.  First is that it can get a bit mathy/prescriptive at times when you can determine 12 moves ahead what cards you are going to get (or more to the point, *not* going to get).  Second, I worry about replayability down the line.  I think this has a good 15-20 plays in it, but then I'm not sure if there is enough card variety to keep it fresh.  I guess I'll find out when I get there.  :)

Very good adaptation of the original game with the same feeling and competition for military, science and victory points!

It might suffer from a runaway leader syndrome as I've experienced in my 2 latest games though...

I really liked the game,I like it way better than the normal 7 Wonders because the decisions on this one are much harder because of the things you leave open for the other player, it's much more tense than in the normal game, it's also more interactive I think.

Eva liked the game, the only thing she didn't like was the scoring of the Guild cards because I scored all 3 of them based on her city, she said it felt she did the work and I scored!

UPDATE:
The expansion makes this even better!

 I picked up 7 Wonders Duel at the recommendation of my Geek Chat League (yay Beehive!). This was recommended to me by several members as being a good little two player game that offered interesting decisions but wasn't too complicated.

Well, they were bang right.

Mrs Fish and I have really enjoyed the game so far and I can see us getting a lot more play in the years to come. Really good gameplay, quite distinct from the original 7 Wonders, and great art. The only minor quibble is that the cardstock could be of better quality but that can easily be fixed with a bit of sleeving.

UPDATE:

A definite keeper. Plays well and now we both know it a good option once the Little Fish are abed.

RATING: 7
It is interesting to compare the graphic design of the cards here to that of the original 7-Wonders.  In this game, the cards are elegantly designed so that you can stack up the cards, exposing only their mechanically significant icons.  This facilitates gameplay at the expense of theme.  I don't feel like I'm building a civilization, just exposing some symbols.  The game is strategically, tactically and mechanically sound, but it  doesn't excite me or carry me away to it's game world.

One of the absolute best games for two people.

It follows the theme from the original game, but works differently.

The rules are fairly easy, especially if you played the original game, the playthrough is quick (~30 min), and the decisions are interesting and meaningful.

When both players know the rules and are experienced, each turn can sometimes take less than a couple of seconds, so it's very smooth and very rare that you just sit around and wait for the other player.

Takes all the interesting, fast build-up of its "bigger brother", and twists it into a deadly 2-players affair. At first I wasn't happy with the somewhat fiddly setup (rows of front/rear cards) but after a couple of plays I love it. The combat marker is absolutely brutal. The italian version is well done.
A great, fast, rewarding f2f struggle.

7W2 has it all. A new drafting mechanics, that makes sense in two players (unlike exchanging of hidden hands), streamlined mechanics of army and science (both allowing sudden victory DURING the game, so another thing to watch out for), perfectly short and fast-paced length, a little bit of randomness in setup to keep it replayable... and even a little bit better looks than its namesake ancestor.

Any fans of 7 Wonders who get to play in two players (like with spouses, for example), this is a must-buy. Any other people, at least think about it and go check out some videos. This may well be the best competitive game purely for two that I played.

RATING: 8
Played only once so probably just luck but we didn't  get to use a single green token as no pairs ever formed. Apart from that it was a really good experience. The way you have to set up the cards is interesting as it brings another thing to think about; how do I stop the other player from getting this and that. Will be playing this a lot this year.

Sokkal jobb a "nagytestvérnél", hiszen megoldja a távol ülő játékosokkal lévő interakció hiányát (2 játékos van). Sokkal jobban kijön a játék íze, és végre egy jó 2 személyes, ami nem taktikai, hanem inkább stratégiai kategóriába sorolható.
A lapkafelcsapás kissé determinisztikus, a fordításoknál sok múlhat a szerencsén, bár ez izgalmat visz a játékba.  Néha van olyan helyzet sajnos, ami kivédhetetlen (nem lehet megakadályozni a lap elvételét, úgy jön ki a lépés), ez zavaró hiba.
Szeretnék még játszani vele (muszáj lesz beszereznem): saját motor építgetése nagyon élvezetes, a versenyhelyzet pedig feszültséggel teli atmoszférát teremt! A parti után hosszú elemzés következik, ami egy jó játék ismérve.

Ich hätte niemals geglaubt, dass sich das Konzept von 7 Wonders in ein 2-Spieler Korsett stecken lässt. Tatsächlich ist 7 Wonders Duels aber eines der besten 2-Personen Spiele der letzten Jahre. Die Mechaniken des "großen" Vorbildes wurden perfekt übernommen und clever auf die Spieleranzahl angepasst. Die Siegmöglichkeiten sind sogar noch etwas vielfältiger geworden. Das Spielmaterial ist hübsch und hochwertig, die Karten sind kleiner geworden, aber auch das passt zum Thema. Unbedingt kaufen!

Wonderful 2 player game. I like to play this game with my wife. There's some luck involved, but a lot of 7 Wonders Duel is about how good you can utilize the randomly drawn cards to your advantage. You have to approach a match with a flexible mindset. 

Science victory seems really hard to achieve, since your opponent can easily see it coming from a mile away. There's some possibility to rush a military win, however with science... it just takes some time.

When you start learning the game, losing can sometimes feel really frustrating. It gets better when you play with the expansion, as both players get some new options when your original plan doesn't work out. 

7 Wonders Duel is one of my favorite 2 player games. Will play anytime. The expansion is a must-have for this one.

RATING: 7.25
Puntos fuertes: Arte cuidado. Fácil de aprender y mecánica de juego original. Combina azar y estrategia de forma equilibrada. Las cartas caben perfectamente enfundadas en la caja, cosa que en los tiempos que corren no se porqué las editoriales no se dignan a estandarizar. El juego está diseñado para que puedas ganar de muchas formas y reconducir la estrategia compensando el azar. Las maravillas están bien implantadas en el juego.

Puntos débiles: Para la duración de las partidas, tiene bastante despliegue y preparación de los mazos y la colocación de las cartas.

Conclusión: Quizás de los mejores juegos para dos que hemos probado. Aunque por nuestra forma de jugar, se nos hace un poco engorroso sacarlo por el despliegue que tiene. El juego base, una vez jugado 3 o 4 veces se nos queda corto porque las cartas son las que son, aunque no deja de tener múltiples variantes. El juego es redondo, no cojea por ningún sitio. Con la expansión gana mucho. Es necesario probarlo para darte cuenta de las posibilidades que tiene. Es bastante entretenido.

7 Wonders: Duel definitely feels similar to playing its older sibling. There are some important differences, of course (the threat of military/science insta-victories; progress tokens; the different way of drafting). But overall, the 2 games feel pretty similar. My wife & I both like 7 Wonders, so not surprisingly, we also both liked 7 Wonders: Duel. But while we do enjoy the 2P version of 7 Wonders, we enjoy Duel a bit more.

7 Wonders: Duel is a very good small-box game for 2 players which has some meat on it. There aren't very many of those, so for that reason alone I'd say 7 Wonders: Duel is a keeper.

Easy to pick up and learn, but not very exciting. There has never been a moment when I was on edge or terribly excited about a win. To me, it ends kind of abruptly without any sort climax or ending... It just stops. 

It's a good game to introduce some strategy to non-gamers. My wife likes it because it does have strategy, but doesn't take much brain power. 

We bought this game because of the hype on BGG and to be honest, we're pretty disappointed. It's not a bad game by any means, but definitely not worthy of top ten status.

Very much enjoy this 2-player take on 7 wonders! It retains the interaction with neighboring players from the original, and intensifies it through the specific duel-setup. Further, 7 Wonders Duel translates the partially shared, partially hidden information of the original's drafting, but converts it into a visually pleasing play-space. 
It is not perfect - in my experience, much like in the original, a single-minded focus on either science or military will often win you the game, even before the final age, sometimes even if your opponent actively counteracts your strategy. However, this is not, in my experience, much different from the original, other than the fact that if you succeed in these military- or scientific strategies, the game ends straight away, in stead of dragging after the winner is all but decided.
All in all, if you want a 7 wonders experience for just two players, I highly recommend 7 wonders Duel, as it is both a tight and snappy game on its own, as well as miles better than the 2-player variant of the original 7 wonders

Excellent 2-player game. You really feel the tension and the race for the victory. There is also a small luck element in the game, so you can't be sure about your success until the end. 

Problem is that the game mainly ends with counting the VP's. Military and cultural/technological win happens quite rarely. So I mainly go for the VP's, not so much for the other two.

Artwork is good. Also box is small and light, so it's easy to take with you to a friend's place.

All around a good game!

Played once.
Civ ultra-light that plays quickly and easily with an almost arcade feel.  Play isn't memorable, but it is a fun head-to-head race for supremacy.
This 2p abbreviation of 7 Wonders captures the feel of its bigger brother, but in a direct head-on challenge.

Love this game. It's easy to explain if you already know 7 Wonders, plays very smoothly and quickly, and really manages to reshape the core drafting mechanic of the original game in a way that makes sense for two players. I think I might actually like it better than the original so far.

RATING: 4.5
After first game, some issues:

-science symbols 5 tokens are kinda icon heavy, overly so.
-tiny ass cards, I prefer 7W size or normal size.
-military is not overly interesting nor science, it feels a bit too abstracted, though the tug of war is okay ish.
-setting up age by age is annoying and the order feels arbitrary
-2p was eh overall. I prefe multiplayer version and didnt even like that that much
-a bit luck based if the rigt cards for military or science would come out

Art was good but didnt pay attention. Felt relatively balanced and probably okay ish replay.

RATING: 8
[b]Length: 4/5[/b] It may actually be a little too fast. It'd be nice if maybe there was one additional age in the game. It'd feel slightly less rushed and give your engine a bit more time to work for you, which is really important in a civ game. It really is only a small problem, since it's just close enough to be long enough.

[b]Theme: 4/5[/b] Not an original theme, but to streamline it this much and still have a good Civ theme is pretty surprising.

[b]Strategy: 3/5[/b] Although there is strategy, it's pretty obvious what it may be. If you're going for a military/science victory, you want to attempt to force your opponent to free a card that will achieve you victory. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure that out, but it can be interesting to try to figure out how you will force it. It's usually a pretty good idea to balance your civ, but in all honesty it's also usually obvious what to go for. Economic buildings are good if you're constantly short on money. Getting resources that your wonders don't produce is probably a good idea since your wonders will cover them, it's usually a good idea to get some science buildings to not only keep your opponent from achieving science victory, but also in an attempt to get a bonus. Basically, the game is well balanced, but it means that there's really not much wrong you can do.

[b]Fiddliness 2/5[/b] I will admit, trying to set up the cards in their formations is pretty obnoxious. It's not the end of the world, and it won't take much longer than you'd originally expect upon looking at the layout for the cards, but it's a bit of a pain to try and make sure the cards are set up in the right formation without sliding off of each other. You are also going to be going through ages quickly, and for this reason, setting up the cards is going to be about 15% of the actual game.

I also have to give a shoutout to the incredible insert. It's one of the best, and the game is actually kinda satisfying to put back up.

I started out rating this an 8, but I have lowered it a little recently, ending up at the same level as 7 Wonders itself. I think my wife and me are in the minority of people that actually like the two player version of the original 7 Wonders. We like duel also, but ultimately we decided that one 7 Wonders game is enough and that this is not different enough to warrant keeping both. Since we both like 7 Wonders as a multiplayer game also, that game has more use to us, and we have decided to trade this one away. I do still think this is a good game, and would play it more times if we didn’t already have the original 7 Wonders, but it’s just not special enough to keep around.

One of our favorite two-player games. Awesome use of multiple win conditions. Always feels different because of the way the cards are put down in the pyramids and what cards are covered up. Gives a great push and pull between you and your opponent.

Solid 2-player game and interesting timeframe. However, the mechanics don't allow much catching up if you're already lagging behind. Therefore, you may take a serious beating on your first game, then brutalize your opponent on the second one, then have a very tight score on the third one. Knowing how and when to build your wonders is key, preferably by the end of the second age. Theme is good, components are nice and the box is packing-friendly. Another great game from Antoine Bauza and Bruno Cathala! This one will stick around for a while.

7 Wonders Duel doesn't need to exist as a standalone game. A few tweaks and additions could have been made to the original 7 Wonders and they could have been packed together as a 2nd Edition.

7WD has improved the most confusing part of the original, the prerequisite system, has been cleaned up using better iconography. I'm not a fan of the downsizing of the cards to mini size, but its not a dealbreaker for me.

What is a dealbreaker is the scoring at the end of the game, same as regular 7 Wonders. That, and the absence of the card drafting that was so fun about the original, make this game not worth owning.

Gioco perfetto per due. Entry level per la sua semplicità, si spiega in 5 minuti. Consigliatissimo per chi si affaccia per la prima volta al mondo dei boardgames magari con un amico. Rigiocabilissimo e scalabile per le variazioni di disposizione delle carte. Ogni meccanica è ben ponderata, anche se fino ad ora non ho ancora visto una vittoria scientifica. Non sottovalutate la guerra perché il terreno perso nelle prime due ere potrà essere devastante nella terza. Davvero intrigante e divertente. Lo consiglio!

I like the game overall. Fairly easy to teach and get into. I also like how quick it can be.

A few things I don't like:

1. Set up and take down are a bit tedious with shuffling decks, removing cards, setting up each age, etc.

2. Component quality is somewhat lacking. Cards all warp easily. Sleeving helped, but I expected better quality.

3. The randomness of the set up can result in occasional games where it can be pretty clear that a player will lose early on. Some games just resulted in a sequence of cards that no amount of strategy could have over come. It' rare but extremely disheartening when it happens.

It's a nice fast game and probably one of the greatest small games for two players. The 7 Wonders theme never grew much on me, I can't seem to feel like I'm building a civilization at all.

I don't rank it higher because I can't seem to feel the theme and make a story on my mind when I play it.

The components have been slightly downgraded from its big cousin. The design remains the same.

7 Wonders as a game includes many mechanisms that are not fit (or are far from ideal) for 2 players. But they have found imaginative abd brilliant ways to this conversion and they have managed to keep game feeling of the original game. This is no small feat at all!!

Draft, War, Science and Buying resources from your neighbours would have not worked as they were in the main game. They have been redesigned into new mechanisms that are quite brilliant.

What I dislike the most about this game is the lack of real choice. You don't have a lot of options, around half of the turns you will only have 1-2 cards to choose from. And most of the times, will be an evident better option for the strategy you are following. Available resource and money reduce the number of viable choices even more.

This lack of choice and the fact that some of the cards are face down create too much randmoness for me. Nonetheless, its short duration makes me willing to forgive this "issue".

A pleasant conversion of the big game, although surely not worthy of all the hype surrounding it. A nice tableau (pinched from the old Tri-peaks Windows game, I'll be bound) emulates the deprivation strategies nicely, and the instant-win scenarios are potentially very tense as a result. The general gist of 7 Wonders runs clearly through the game without it ever feeling derivative.

Duel positively reeks of solid design and playtesting, and it's very playable, but I wouldn't put it over other 2P conversions such as ACBaS or Inland Port.

My first impressions after last night's 3 repeatedly game is wow!

Game is easy to teach and play, takes short time 30 minutes, a bit luck involved and also you can do lots of choices and plans. Every game is different because different cards are out of game and different wonders and bonus science cards are opened. This increases repeativity.

I won 3 of them and I could do enough strategy even game is so basic. 3 game took 2 hours with preperations. We played between 1.00am and 3.00am even hour is late we did not get sleepy.

Game is cheap (15-20 Euros), and art/component quality is very high.

I loved game very much and my friend too. This is definately a must have game. One of the best 2 player games. However I have doubts about girls like this game or not. I did not yet played it with my girlfriend.

Edit : My girlfriend liked it too. So this means I have a player to play it most times. So I increase its score 8.6 from 8.4

[b]7 Wonders: Duel[/b] was traded away in a math trade 1/17/16. (Received El Gaucho)

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (10):[/COLOR]

[i]7 Duel This was one of my most anticipated games last year and it ended up being a flop. 7W is one of my son's favorites, but Duel felt nothing like the original. Neither of us cared for the alternate win conditions and while many like the drafting mechanism in Duel I did not. Getting screwed over because of a cad flip wasn't fun. In short I never felt like I was building towards something, there wasn't much progression round to round. I found Duel to be a watered down version of 7W and not a game I need to play again.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]First I have to admit that the hype surrounding this game has probably effected how I feel about it. I was expecting a similarly amaziing experience to the first time I played 7 Wonders and it actually kind of fell flat. I understand all the decisions that were made to add tension into the 2p game, but I'm not sure that I like them. 

Specifically I'm talking about the alternate victory conditions, winning via military or science. While this adds a lot of interaction and tension in the game, there are times when your hands are tied and you need to select a card you don't want because you've already let your opponent collect too much military or science. This isn't really fun or very strategic, in fact it's pretty straight forward. There is also a fair bit of randomness in the game for 2 reasons, first you have o idea what the face down cards are so your opponent can get a huge boon if the right card gets revealed, on top of that 3 cards are removed from each age at the beginning of the round. It is surprising how much those 3 cards have effected our games, in one game one of the science symbols was completely out of the game and in another I was strapped for resources the whole game because a lot of resource cards were removed from the game. 
There are ways to help mitigate the luck found in the game which I'll highlight below:

- The drafting pyramids you build create some tense decisions when choosing which card to take, but also introduces a lot of randomness since you have no idea which card(s) you'll be revealing for your opponent.
- The wonders do help mitigate the randomness of the game, especially the wonders that give you another turn.
- You can mitigate a lack of resources if you focus on getting cards that have the upgrade symbols.
- The guilds are quite powerful because you can choose whether to use your tableau of cards or your opponents when figuring out the VP/coins that are generated.

Where does that leave me, I'm really not sure. Considering how much my family enjoys 7 Wonders (one of my son's favorites) I'm willing to give 7W Duel more plays and my gut feeling is that the more I play the less random the game will feel. In the end I think I'll always prefer 7 Wonders, but it is nice to have a quick, 2 player version in our collection. It'll be interesting how I feel about this one a year from now.[/i]

2-player version of its parent, 7 Wonders. Solid implementation of 7 Wonders in a head to head setting. Played this numerous times with my wife. Most of the time though I feel like I'm going through the motions. For me, its lost some of its initial charm as I win most of the time and there don't feel to be a lot of choices. In my wife's top 10. That and the small footprint are what keep it in the collection. I feel like it has coasted on the coat tails of its big daddy. Otherwise I dont see how it holds its spot in the top 100.

RATING: 9
This is a good one. The first duel game I've played, and while the rules are a little deep (even when you understand them you HAVE to keep the rule book on you to explain what certain cards do) it's an absolute blast. There's nothing quite as satisfying as godfathering your way to victory against someone you've lost to 3 times in a row. It's also really well balanced, and while some cards are definitely more powerful than others you'll have a hard time blowing someone out.

Need to play a second (and more) time.  It's been a couple of weeks since we played, but as I recall, I felt a little guilty about the win.  For one, I got my wonders all built first.  While I had pointed out that rule to my wife, it was still forgotten.  For another, I think I ended up pushing military to the point where she lost some money.  Basically, I didn't feel like I was playing to attack, but I attacked none-the-less.

It's still clever, and I like it, but am a little worried about the conflict.

Pretty similar to 7 Wonders, except smoothened for 2 players. Good game. Only negative are that it can happen that there is no way to prevent that all the resources cards go to one player, which makes it almost impossible to win for the other.

Having never enjoyed 7 Wonders any of the times I've played, I was skeptical of this two-player version. But I really liked this iteration! Maybe what's missing from the main version is that there is no clear indication to what I'm working towards or who's in the lead. Duel reveals some cards but most cards are public knowledge and your strategy comes from pre-empting your opponent. I love how the military mechanic is handled here, as a valid way to win the game. I was fully aware of my decisions during each turn and knew what I was aiming at; what cards to keep away from my opponent and what cards I forced into his hand. Instead of card drafting (which is messy and confusing in a seven player game), every card is laid out in a mahjong-style, having access to some cards and only being able to see others. In my humble opinion, this is what 7 Wonders intended to be: easy to learn, easy to strategize, and fun to play. Loved this game!

RATING: 10
Perfect two player iteration of the card-drafting game. The original game seems to be too much of a sandbox for me; too many decisions, not enough direction. But only having one opponent clarifies my strategy for this game. I've slaughtered Paulo almost every time we've played; not from points but from the military track which doesn't grant a lot of endgame points but frustrates and distracts your opponent, ensuring a swift victory. Always fun to play, easy to set up and gives players interesting decisions.

Very nice implementation. The need for more money and more throwouts (vis a vis the original) surprised me a little, but is compensated by the extra cards available each age. The military and science instant-win capabilities are inspired, providing threats during the game that you must monitor, which immediately provides more interaction and opponent-deprivation plays than the original does. A good thing in a 2 player game. It reminds me of the multiple-win-races provided by one of my favourite 2-player abstract games, Aton, but this has the advantage of being laced with theme, making it more attractive to non-gamers. It's very likeable.

Genius. Excellent. Scratches my itch for 7 Wonders when only 2 players available. Different game than vanilla 7 Wonders, particularly since there is no drafting, but otherwise has same good stuff. However, there is drafting of the Wonders. I love the base game and cannot wait to try the expansion.

I wish the cards were bigger, but then more tablespace would be needed.

I am one of the rare people that enjoy 7 Wonders with 2 players, but I don't know if I prefer that to 7 Wonders Duel. Duel has a deeper Euro feel to it than it's big sister. "Why not love both?", I say.

RATING: 8.5
Lots of plays over New Year's!

Jenn didn't like it because of the drafting, since you can force your opponent to choose between low utility cards, and thereby reveal better cards underneath. I found that one player is usually rolling in resources and the other is scavenging for science or military to win. There *have* been some epic military comebacks, so there's still excitement even if you feel you can't build anything with resources.

That being said, the expansion provides other turn actions other than to draw a card, so we'll look into it once we get through everything else!

Update: Jenn likes it now since she realizes science cheese isn't the best strategy.

A really nice 2-persons game. The only negative is the the startplayer has a big advantage and therefor the 2nd player should have 1 or 2 coins more from start I think, which you can agree on outside the ordinary rules. If it wasn't for that, the game would be perfect!

My thoughts on this are kinda, well, "mehhhhhh".

My thoughts are mixed. After about 10 plays, I rate this only a 6 currently, even though it is currently #9 on BGG.  I'm not seeing (yet) how the most precise play can swing the game to one's favor. Also not seeing any huge advantage, or strategy even, in chasing the discs.

Maybe we're missing something?

RATING: 7
15 plays - Preferred this over 7 wonders. Have enjoyed this with my partner on and off for a long time. There's a bit of replayability there too, with different wonder combinations and science tokens. The gameplay is quite fast and addictive.

However, I originally rated this an 8, but after a half dozen plays put it down to a 7. This was because, even though there are 3 routes to victory (a big appeal of the game), the military and science victories are not very viable after some basic familiarity with the cards. The science and military is still useful as it impoverishes your opponent (sometimes in critical moments) and gets you special abilities, but they are not victory routes. The problem is that if you actively pursue these victory types, your opponent is probably going to get all the 'point' cards while quite easily purchasing just enough of the 'other cards' to stop you from achieving your alternate goal(s). Unfortunately, by the time your science/ war plans are fully thwarted (with relative ease), there's little way for you to recover when the end game scores.

Overall, this doesn't make it a bad game at all - it is still quite good. The fact that those alternate victory conditions are there, does mean that players do need to stay aware of opponent purchases as oppossed playing their own game, making gameplay more interactive, variable and just a little more deep. If these win conditions were more viable though, this could have been one of the great 2p games.

I can't say that I am a fan of 7 Wonders but I was willing to give this version a chance. Although a lot of the base mechanics are the same I found that the two player version was much more interesting as you can actually plan and keep track of your opponent while maintaining the simple game play of adding cards to your play area and gaining points based on sets or multipliers. A nice two player game with some interesting thought to it. Not sure if it will still interest me after many plays but for now I like it.

Really fun, but entirely overrated, two player game with some interesting twists on the original 7 Wonders.  The progress tokens you can get through science is a nice addition.  I can see where due to card flips at key times the third age may be anticlimactic or even unnecessary.  But it is a fun game to explore.  Even so, I still rank it below other 2 player card game classics like Battle Line or Lost Cities.

Prefer this over 7 Wonders. 7 wonders takes too long with new players, and people unfamiliar with card drafting. Duel helps shorten that with 2 player limit, and letting the player see the options on the table so they can think about their next turn during the opposing players.

7 Wonders: Duel is a two-player game based on the award-winning drafting game 7 Wonders.  Instead of passing a hand of cards around to draft them, cards are arranged in a central display such that the corners of some cards are on top of other cards.  Cards cannot be taken unless they have no other cards on top of them.  Actually, the similarities to 7 Wonders are mostly thematic, as the mechanics of most of the card types has changed.  The military cards work as a tug-of-war which provides various bonuses as the marker advanced on the track.  The science cards can be turned in for a special ability if you can play two with the same symbols (and there are many more different symbols).  In any case, the thing I enjoyed most about this game was taking cards such that my opponent didn't have access to the cards I'd need later on.  I thought the game was pretty good.

A relatively satisfying experience for the amount of time it takes, although not my favourite 2-player game. There are lots of positives, but the way that you can calculate who will be able to reach the most important cards is a big negative. Second-turn wonders mitigate this a little, and the (very) short playing time of around 30 mins makes it less of an issue, but a niggle nonetheless.

Very good game.

It is simple to explain, fast to play and relates a lot to people who are just getting into boardgames because of its simplicity. The setup for the different ages are interesting and add some chaos and chance to the game in a good way, making just different enough from play to play.

Newcomers like the feeling of their city growing and using its resources the bigger it gets. I would recommend not to binge play but space out your plays of it, cause it could get a bit samey in some time, but it depends on the player your going against. 

Highly recommended.

[center]- Stéphanie B.[/center]

RATING: 6
Good game at first - many ways to win, however it fades quickly as its warts become known:

Of the dozen or so games, two of them went way out of bounds statistically where one player got lucky with early "card-reveals" and so quickly gained the resources to dominate; leading to an almost comical runaway scenario. Most games were relatively balanced, but those two games were such runaways that the winner (once me, once my wife) felt awkward, saying: "I didn't deserve to win by that margin".

Also - the game has some "dick moves" in the form of attack cards that remove critical resources from a competitor causing their engine to stall. Attack cards that cost strength or money can be interesting, but attack cards that destroy something a person has built are... not fun.

Also - there are 8 wonders in each game, only 7 of which can be built which means one player cannot build all their wonders. It's advantageous to be the one who builds all four wonders, and once both players realize this, the entire first half of the game becomes a sprint to build all four, which dominates game play and largely obsoletes any focus on science or military. After ten or so plays, the game becomes a race to build four wonders and then spend the rest of the game grabbing random blue point-cards or using attack cards to strip the opponent's engine.

I've never had a game be so fun on the first few plays and fade so fast. Once we figured the game's dominant win conditions it fell off a cliff.

Fun and fast little game that has great solo rules available on BGG. I wonder if the AI is too easy to beat?  Will have to try more games to see.  Also although theme is present, the game plays so fast that one doesn't pay too much attention to the theme which is sad.  Maybe I'll have to play slower...

This quickly became a favorite of mine, even replacing Race for the Galaxy as my go-to 2-player quick game. Very simple rules but plenty of depth. The brilliant touch of adding the possibilities of sudden-death military and science victory creates for a very tense experience, in which you are often fighting for every card in the table and trying to outguess your opponent's next move. Actually better than the original 7 Wonders.

RATING: 8
Great game as is the original 7 wonders. However, since I don't see anything wrong with the 2-player mode of the original game, this doesn't seem as appalling as most people say.

To sum up:
If you already own 7 Wonders and enjoy 2-player game - don't buy this.
If you don't own 7 Wonders or don't like its 2-player mode - definitely buy this.

I feel it is an improvement to the original 7 Wonders. Takes away a large part of drafting games I tend not to enjoy, by putting cards into a pyramid like structure. You have to weigh the pros and cons of cards that will get exposed, the value it has for your opponent, all while balancing three win conditions that could end the game at any time. I got crushed my first game, but was a card or two away from winning on a military front.

If you play a lot of 2p games this is probably a must have. I love its big brother 7 wonders and rate that 10/10.

+Familiar 7 Wonders mechanics w/ some tightened mechanics (yellow cards, reduced resources, automatic victory conditions)
=Some luck-of-the-draw influence. Lots of timing and planning dynamics between your best choice and opponents; this creates a lot of DUEL tension as you twist, take and cut your opponents options.
-Because of number of cards, gameplay might get stale after repeated play. Original 7 wonders promotes some cooperative play, while Duel is much more cutthroat.

The gameplay reminds me of those modified solitaire games where you build card pyramids. I like how the theme as well as the different cards were transferred over from the original 7 Wonders.

The slight feeling you got of things not being under your control just got solved with Duel. With 2P it almost becomes chess like because you can predict the cards your opponent wants and he/she know what you want. Military can't be neglected altogether, which is a good thing as well. One of the best upgrades I've seen to a game.

Nice 2 player implementation of 7 Wonders.
Has the same general look but plays better in my opinion.

I like the different layouts with known and unknown cards to represent the card draft. That military and science can lead to instant wins. Having resource cards forces additional cost to your opponent.
All makes for a nice resource management game

I like 7 Wonders Duel. It is a nice take on a 2 player drafting game which otherwise doesn't work all that well. It is fun to play and build up your civilization and try to compare it to your opponents. 

But while all of that  is true, I'm not so sure on how much strategic depth this one offers. Certainly there is some skill in the game, but I feel that the 3 cards removed from each age are a poor design decision that negates the ability to strategically plan ahead for what might be coming. I suppose the main reason for this is so a player can't deduce what a face down card actually is, but I'm not a big fan of how the removed cards can vastly change the feasibility of a military or scientific victory. 

I'll play this sometimes, but there are many other 2 player games that I like more.

I find regular 7 Wonders to be merely OK at best, but (based on one play) this one seems to be a truly excellent 2-player game. Lokking forward to play this a lot more.

Wow, didn't expect to like this one as I don't care for 7 Wonders.

Switching out the [gameid=13823] creates a game with much better flow. In 7 Wonders, my brain farts whenever I receive a hand of cards to draft from from my neighbour. I'm not wasting my time remembering what cards are going around. Here, there's none of that. You can see what cards are coming up!

Also, for a game so relatively light, there are too many fiddly bits in 7 Wonders. There's still a few fiddly bits in 7 Wonders: Duel, but because there's only two players, it's much easier to keep track of them all!

Pros:
1. Minimal luck - luck mostly revolves on what happens to be revealed when buying cards. This can cause some swings in the game, but not overly much.
2. Quick Play - First time playing with teaching took less than 30 minutes.
3. Simple - Rules are fairly straightforward. 

Cons:
1. One Strategy - I have a limited number of plays, but it seems you must concentrate on production and economy cards early in the game as there are a limited number of them in round 2 and none of them in round 3.
2. Science Icons - There are a very few of the science icons that can be matched up. Only 2 or 3 of each. This makes it extremely difficult to get 2 of them. Making the bonus coin mechanic not very useful. Also, requiring 6 different ones to win the game is silly. The points should escalate up with each different one that is gained, like stone age and the artifacts. Some people may like the shoot the moon aspect of it, but I thought it was a put off as it's easy to identify and easy to stop.
3. Military - Useless. Don't bother concentrating on this early, as it suffers from the family feud effect. The third round provides many military cards that are worth 2 moves making going after military in the first 2 rounds almost useless.

Overall Summary: As far as 2 player games go, this is actually a pretty good game despite my several issues with it. It's an engine building game that plays quickly. It's fast enough that I'm not overly concerned about many of my strategy complaints. Play it once very quickly and then move on to other games for the night.

I don't know about this game. It gets this crazy love in the rankings but it hasn't given me that same feeling, yet. I do like it more each time I play but I hate how you are always stuck on rails because it is a back and forth between 2 players. The wonders that allow you to take 2 turns in a row does help this problem to a certain extent but you can run into the problem of one person getting more of those wonders than the other and that seems to be a problem as well. I have always been a fan of the 2-player variant for the original 7 Wonders and I still prefer that over this game but I like the game lenth of this game for certain situations.

"Duel" is a very good reimplementation of the original "7 Wonders" - if you love the latter and want to play with your spouse or a friend, definitely pick it up. While the draft mechanic was changed to something very different, the feeling of the original is still here - plus, being able to see half of the cards (AND being unable to see the other half) introduces some new tactics and strategies. It's beautiful, it's quick, can be very tense when you're going head to head with your opponent and building you own little civilization is always fun.

Still, for me it's only a 7. A bit too light and a bit too repetitive for my personal taste, but enjoy it very much from time to time - especially when I'm not in the mood for heavier games.

The beauty of this game is how easy it is to learn and also the very quick play time (~30 mins). That means it's something you can quickly grab off the shelf and introduce to anyone.

This was a really big meh for me. It felt like turn order and game flow were incredibly important but that the game didn't offer enough opportunity to manipulate them.  Patchwork allows players to chose what tiles to buy or choose to pass knowing how that will impact an opponents options. This one gave a lot less options in that regard. Also, the push pull tug of war style was boring and unimaginative. With so many other really good 2 player games this just doesn't make the cut IMHO.

You really cannot argue with this game. The variation of play every time it comes to the table is fantastic. The strategy is also great.

A very tense back and forth battle. I like the race to build the wonders. Cards that let you immedistely take an extra turn a very powerful and often the only way to guarantee your opponent doesn't bury the card you need. I don't think it is very likely to see a game end with a military or science victory if both players are paying close enough attention, but it's fun having that threst loom over you at all times. Overall: a nice addition to my 2-player game collection. It might even get played more than regular 7 Wonders thanks to the quick setup and play time.

RATING: N/A
2P only.

Instead of card drafting, you just pull cards off the table.  Picking up some cards, makes cards underneath them available to your opponent (some cards are face-down until they are revealed by picking up the cards that partially cover them).  You can do 3 things with cards you pick up:
  1) pay the cost to build into your city,
  2) discard for $2 (+$1 for every yellow card in your city)
  3) use to build a wonder (if you can pay the cost of the wonder)

You can win via military, or via science.  If neither of these creates a victory, then most points (based on buildings and wonders constructed) wins the game.

This is a solid game.  It's a go-to for 2 player games for my wife and I.  There is a bit too much luck involved in the layout of the tiles for me to rate it this high given the base rules.  With the Pantheon expansion, however...wow!

In the base game, if you are simply unable to get a decent collection of material cards in era 1, then you're going to hate eras 2 and 3.  To combat this we've implemented the following house rule, which has worked well for us.

[b]House Rule:[/b]
[i]At the end of the first era count the difference between BASIC material cards between the players.  

If player 1 had 2 basic material cards and player 2 has 5 basic material cards the difference is 3.  In this case player 1 will be able to chose 3 face-up BASIC material cards shown in era 2 and mark them with a coin from the bank.

The marked cards are only available for player 1.  However, player 1 must choose the marked cards if able as their highest priority.  This is to prevent player 1 from using those marked cards as a strategic blocker for player 2.[/i]

Using this house rule we've been able to ensure tighter scores.  We've run into several games where there is a certain winner by the end of era 1.  It's not poor planning or judgment by the losing player - sometimes the cards just come out so that one player gets destroyed!

The Pantheon expansion completely solves this problem, for us, because you have more opportunity to move in and out of the "pyramid" and prevent getting cornered into poor choices.

A good game that replaces the 2-player variant for 7 Wonders.

My only real problem is that the Age I military cards seem to be completely overshadowed by the late ages' military cards.  This makes them almost trap cards to take and use.  There is some mitigation with one Age I military card being a chain for a powerful Age III military card, but it is an isolated case.

Very well converted two player version of 7 Wonders.  The card drafting is different to the original 7 Wonders, such that cards are laid out in a structure and you drafting a card gives your opponent to access cards that were blocked by your card. There is some luck involved as if there are good cards available to you or you just take bad cards and grant your opponent access to good ones. Since this game plays very quickly, I do not mind that too much.

A very good duel version with a 7 Wonders feel however, this is a very different beast.  Defeat via military and science domination is very real and tense in this game and it can really be difficult to even get to scoring. The decision making in this game can be very agonizing or very unforgiving played out.   This is because of the set up and flipped cards.  Compared to 7 Wonders with game has more randomness because sometime the cards when flipped just doom one of the players.   However, i don't want to be down on this game, it's a fabulous game that is much more tense the 7 wonders. I really enjoyed delving into the strategies and tactics of this one and look forward to continuing to explore it.

On the whole, the game is fantastic. I really enjoy how the reveal mechanic requires strategy, but doesn't drag out the game via AP. I also very much appreciate the multiple ways in which one can win - it keeps things interesting throughout. My only real complaint lies with luck. It's not necessarily an inappropriately high amount - just slightly more that I ideally prefer. Still a great game though.

Great game, very well balanced, with just a bit of luck factor. The only flaw I found in this game is its longevity: only a few new wonders or scientific coins can be added in an hypothetical expansion because changing/adding cards of the three ages would affect the game balance. The "remove 3 random cards from every age" feature makes it a little bit more playable on the long run but the games are still similar to each other. It's like playing a draft Magic the Gathering match with always the same expansion.

I quite liked the original 7 Wonders. The game was marred only by the fact that it's 2 player variant sort of sucked. Imagine my excitement when I saw this game! 

The best part is: 7 Wonders: Duel delivers. This is a tight and tense card game that's easy to pick up and tough to put down. On and off the table in less than an hour, and ALWAYS some ensuing conversation thereafter. The Majhong-type mechanic that drives the game is unique and intuitive, yet not overbearing. My only problem is, the base game gets tiring after a while. I don't really feel like I NEED to play this again. Luckily the Pantheon expansion is more than enough to bump this up to a light 9.

If you play predominantly 2-player games, this game is a must-have. It's a bit cutthroat, so it's not for everyone, but it's always got a spot in my collection.

the overlaps with hidden cards is just brilliant and brings me back to all those summers watching grandma cheat at pyramid solitaire ("oh, drat! what have i uncovered?"). you always have some slight idea what's coming next and only ever open up a little more information for your opponent, but every single reveal could be just what they needed to scrape by. you're trying to be the best at gathering gold, resources, or connections to sponge up civic buildings and wonders, all the while tantalized with the option to threaten serious war or science. but, your opponent can see you trying to end the game early! this just leads to more delicious decisions between whether to buy the thing, block the other thing, or just stall for time. my favorite, favorite mechanism in gaming is when you must leave something juicy behind for your opponent in order to fulfill your own goals, and that's exactly what Duel does with every action. such tension, such agony! this is my kind of 2-player interaction! however, this game is not without my least favorite thing in gaming: "take-that." some wonders allow you to destroy your opponent's buildings and war allows you to steal money. those things aside, even blocking in this game doesn't feel overly mean because there's always another choice. for such a limited number of things you can do each tactical turn, it's surprising how fondly i look back to this game as one with achievable strategies. plays well during a work lunch break!!

16-10-2015. Rated after 5 plays. Very fun twist on 7 Wonders, for two. Works great.

The game works over 3 'ages'. Each Age you have a pyramid or geometrical grid of overlapping face-up and face-down cards you can draft. You can only draft cards that are face-up, and have no cards on top of them. As soon as a card is fully uncovered, they open up.

In your turn, you can build cards, by drafting and paying resources. Built buildings give you VPs, military power, technology and resources. You can build wonders, big cards that you drafted at the start of the game and give you VPs and abilities.

There are 3 ways to win, VPs, military or tech. If your opponent ever crushes your civilization by drafting WAY more war-cards, or crushes your Civilization by drafting at last 6 different technologies, they auto-win. 

I really like it and my GF is a big fan too.

RATING: 6
I'm interested in playing this more, but I was a bit disappointed after my first play due to being overhyped. I love 7 Wonders, but not because it is the best game ever but because it fills the niche of fast-playing, high-player count strategic games that is sparsely populated by any other good games.  Duel definitely improves upon the 2-player variant of 7 Wonders, and I probably will pick it up to play with my wife or son, but it doesn't do anything amazing for the densely populated fast-playing 2-player game market.

Update: Yeah, I just bleh - mediocre mass appeal.  I'm not going to buy this one.  I find the card tree a bit predictable and boring - I tend not to like that dynamic where I am forced to take a card to let you get access to the next card.  The opposite of drafting, where you pass a hand hoping your opponent doesn't take the 2nd card you really wanted, and don't know if they'll know how much you want it or not.  Fairy Tale is straight-up better.  Better drafting dynamics, plays well with 2 but also more.  At this point in my collection, it seems a 2-player-only game has to be amazeballs and unique for me to consider buying it.

Erős játék a Duel. Nagy öröm, hogy Bauza megcsinálta a 7 Wonders élvezetes kétfős variánsát is, amely nagyban támaszkodik az eredetire, mégis teljesen más.
Legnagyobb erőssége, hogy igen nagy benne az interakció (igaz, bármilyen furán hangzik is, többnyire csak közvetetten) és hogy egészen kompakt méretű lett (mind a doboza, mind a kártyák.
Hátránya ugyanakkor, hogy az ember sokszor egyirányú utcába kerül, vagyis elég korlátozott a döntési/választási lehetőség. Vannak elkerülhetetlen triggerek, amelyek nem feltétlenül jók.
Eddig egyébként nem tetszett különösebben a grafika, de itt nagyon eltalálták a dolgot (a stílus ugyanaz, de mégis! - lehet, hogy csak a fekete keretek hiánya miatt érzem így?!)
Gyors, közepesnél valamivel gyengébb stratégiai játék ez. Sajnos a tematika mint olyan nem nagyon van jelen az egészben. Úgyis mindenki csak az ikonokat figyelgeti (amelyek ebben a verzióban sokkal "áramvonalasabbak", letisztultabbak lettek).

:thumbsup: The game has a few clever ways in its set-up to ensure that every game plays out differently (Wonder selection, placing and unlocking a 'structure' of building cards, different science chits, etc.).
:thumbsup: 7 Wonders: duel refines the graphic design of its older brother 7 Wonders.
:thumbsup: It takes up more table space than its box makes you think it does, but it's still a great game to take with you on vacation.
:thumbsup: The three paths to victory almost feel like a mini-game. In a game with two players of roughly the same skill level, victory will probably be decided on points. This entices you to push yourself a bit more to try and win a military or science victory, without lagging behind on points. All this keeps you 'on the edge'.

----

:thumbsdown: Downside of the three paths to victory is that a more experienced player will easily defeat a beginner. On the other hand, this speaks volumes about the game's luck factor too.

RATING: 8
Color me surprised, but I like Duel a lot more than the original 7 Wonders. The first reason is because of the new drafting mechanism, which is inherently more interesting to me than the original game. It allows for more planning, and makes hate-drafting a more tempting prospect. Secondly, the alternate win conditions add depth and tension to game, while still bringing the game more in line with tradition civ elements. It's a far superior version of the original game.

RATING: 6.5
Visual Appeal: (4)
The box is pleasantly small, and the components all share an art style with the original 7 Wonders.

Components: (3)
Linen finish on the score tracker but not on the cards. Cardboard is of average thickness. Standard cardboard chit coins. I usually abhor tiny cards, but I can tolerate them in this game, since it allows for a convenient smaller box size. 

Theme: (3)
Being able to construct multiple wonders feels more thematic I guess. Executed more through art than through gameplay. 

Learning: (4)
About a 60/40 text-to-picture ratio in the rule book. 10 small pages cover the components, setup, and gameplay. I found it very easy to teach. Those who have played 7 Wonders before can pick it up without hesitation.

Gameplay: (3)
I feel more able (compared to 7 Wonders) to plan the expansion of my board since I can see farther ahead right from the beginning of each round. It is still essentially just a simple question, "do I get what I need or remove what I think my opponent needs." Absent is the issue with large player counts in 7 Wonders where I am unable to affect those sitting far from me.

Overall Fun: (3) 
It's good, but not great. My fiancee and I played it a lot for a few months, but now it is starting to cool off and feel samey. I look forward to trying it with other opponents to see if maybe we just know each others' strategies too well.

While always respecting what a good design 7 Wonders is, I've never really warmed to it like others around me. It's always been a great lighter game to bring out with six or seven players and quietly go about doing your thing without much tension or drama. 7 Wonders: Duel adds the tension and drama to the franchise. It's a lovely little see sawing battle between two players this time, using the same general mechanics of its older sister, which makes it very easy to pick up and dive into.

I'm still a little uncertain how much control I have over proceedings, but as long as there is at least the illusion of control then it's a cracker of a 30 minute game and very enjoyable.

7 Wonders specifically for 2 players.  Everything you'do expect it to be.  Lots of flavor from the original, but cards are drafted from pyramids, and only ones not covered can be taken.  Added are a back and forth fight on the military track and tokens that give bonuses for completing wonders.

RATING: 8
I like this game much more than 7 Wonders. Granted, yes, I understand you can only play with 2 players while 7 wonders goes to a much higher player count. But for me, Duel is much less fiddly and I enjoy it more so I would rather just play the 2 player version and play other games with more players.

So far I've really enjoyed 7 Wonders: Duel. There is a lot more tension than 7 Wonders. Military and science are more thematically grounded, add more strategy to the game, and are more exciting than in 7 Wonders. I like the tension between trying to complete your wonders before your opponent so that you can complete all 4, and saving your wonders for when they will have the greatest impact. The wonders that give military or an extra action in particular can put a lot of pressure on your opponent. There is more randomness in 7 Wonders: Duel than in 7 Wonders with 3 players, and I'm not sure how well I'll regard 7 Wonders: Duel as a strategy game in comparison long term, but I'm impressed with what I've seen, and I've had a lot of fun.

There are 3 paths to victory and a near infinite variety of card drafts to get you there. Great artwork and good production values of the components with clear iconography. The card drafting matrix set-ups are a clever way to make the decisions more tense.

This sat on my shelf for months. I bought it on a whim and every time I opened the box I struggled to get enthused about playing it. Well, as luck would have it the kids were banned from electronics and it was raining. It took about an hour to trudge through the rules, answer endless unrelated questions with an easily distracted eight year old, and finally we started playing.

Wow. I loved it. We played it three times on the weekend and I am smitten. The mechanic for laying out the buildings and thus limiting what you can and cant build is the star of the show. It makes each game unique and fun to look at. The game also succeeds in getting that feel of creating an engine that allows better purchases later on more easily. When playing with a child you can subtly influence the result with your building selection so it is enjoyable for them while they develop their skill.

Not perfect. The calculation for trading resources is a bit cumbersome. Winning by science and by military feel anti climactic.

As a game/activity for two people it is fun. As a conduit for spending time with my son, it helped make a memorable weekend. Can't wait to show it to more people and then over commit to those blue buildings again.

Jól működő játékot alkottak a szerzők két személyre. Jó ötlet a katonai és tudományos győzelem és ezek megoldása, bár véleményem szerint nehéz kivitelezni őket. A játék legfőbb erénye, hogy rendkívül gyors, ezért több parti lejátszható egymás után is akár. Amennyire elől van a toplistán azt én azért túlzásnak érzem, de akik rendszeresen kettesben játszanak ott mindenképp helye van ennek a társasnak.

[2016-06-30]
12 játék után úgy érzem a tudományos győzelem sokkal könnyebb, mint a katonai, főleg ha a jog is a korongok közt van. A katonai győzelmet nagyon könnyű kivédeni, egy-egy piros lap megvételével, hisz azzal visszafelé toljuk a sávon a jelölőt, míg a tudományos szimbólumoknál ilyen lehetőség nincs.

As my 'gaming group' is normally just my girlfriend and myself this looked to be the perfect game for us - and it is! This is a really fun, quick, game that is perfect for us - and while quick and simple to set up, there are strategy elements to it -  you can build all your wonders and still lose, if you don't pay attention to your opponents draw! Easily one of my favourite games :)

I like this even better than the original game. It seems rather unlikely anyone would win by Military victory, and Science victory would be very difficult to pull off as well, unless you manage to force your opponent to uncover that last advance you need that happened to be face down. (Knowing the cards in each Age would be a help.)

Plenty of deployability with randomness of cards removed, wonders available, Green chips available (not that they are easy to get), etc. etc.

RATING: 8
By far the best 2-player game I've ever come across. I usually hate luck, but the card drafting mechanism in this game make the luck seem insignificant (all though, it probably is not). I introduced my "I-hate-board-games" girlfriend to it and she actually suggested a replay after the first round; believe me, that itself should give it a gold star! 

For the game itself: It is a quick 2-player game, with very easy learning curve. after 3 turns, you will know the game mechanisms. it takes about 3.5 minutes to explain the game rules and is therefore perfect to introduce new players to. Theme is great, as the artwork is beautiful, and you will undoubtedly have some discussion over which wonder is the best (not in gamepoint value, but in sense of which actual wonder you prefer).

Have fun with this game!

7 Wonders for two players.  I don't know if there's an official term for this style of drafting, but the magic community calls it "quilting."  It's a surprisingly deep and fairly strategic experience that lasts longer than most 2-player games we own without overstaying its welcome.

7 Wonders Duel is great for being a game that decided to have two players and then stick to it. The best parts of the game are tightly designed around the 'duel' aspect of the card drafting e.g. 'I really want this card, but that might expose this really good card to my competitor' etc.

The only criticism is that after many games the cards may become familiar and hence the drafting becomes repetitive. I am expecting the 'Gods' expansion to in some way alleviate this.

One of the best 2-player games, and better than the multiplayer version. It completely gets the feel of 7 Wonders, but with a fresh twist. The cards are somewhat visible, and uncovering cards adds to the tension. The military track is nicely done, and also can really put the pressure on an opponent if they ignore it. The game is well-balanced and rarely felt like there was tit-for-tat that plagues many two-player games.

Also, the Pantheon is a really nice addition to the game. I think it solves some of the problems of not being the one to turn over cards and reveal them to your opponent.

Nice game with relatively low time commitment. Not tons of decision space, and there are times when the card selection is determined for you (i.e. there's only one card available to be taken). This has frustrated me on multiple occasions.

Light and quick which appeals to my wife/regular gaming partner.

RATING: 7
1 play, late prototype

The game is still in development, but I like it -- and I'm not even particularly a fan of the original game! In this version it is much easier to see what the other player is doing, and the change they made to replace drafting works quite well -- especially since you no longer have to try to remember what cards you passed! Each era's cards are placed in a display of alternating face up/down cards, in a different pattern each era. Players alternate taking them, so you have some planning based on a little foreknowledge. As usual, you can use the card for money, build it, or build a wonder (of which only 7 are available), or turn it in for money. There's even military stuff going on, simplified to a little track sitting between the players.

Good version!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
2-player version of 7 Wonders, but the game mechanisms are quite different. Tough choices to make due to the card pyramids, but sometimes you're just stuck giving up a good card to your opponent.  The Pantheon expansion apparently gives players more choices, which can help avoid these types of situations.

This was my first exposure to the idea of card drafting. My girlfriend bought it because of the cool theme and the reputation of the original 7 Wonders, that neither of us had ever played. Since most of our gaming is 2 player, this game is perfect for us. It plays very quickly, which is useful for 2 college kids who often only have a few hours to relax before the next class.

I do think it is not quite as good as "7 Wonders" (since drafting being one of my absolute favorite mechanics it is hard to compare to it) but I think they turned it into an excellent 2 player version which is great for me and the hubby. I love how confrontational it plays, your choices are more dictated by trying to make sure the opponent doesn't get the cards he/ she needs than by simply building your own city as you choose and I think that is a good thing.
In out first game neither of us managed to get a science token, I wonder if that is only to be achieved with luck or the opponent not paying attention...

A more streamlined version of 7 Wonders, but only 2 player. For me, that is a benefit since I usually play with my wife.

"Playing the card arrangement" honestly feels too random. The upside-down cards and playing off what the opponent gives you feels random and trivial. Oftentimes, the best card to take is obvious and as a result really doesn't provide much tension. Feels a bit scripted.

Regardless, it's a fun, quick game.

An absolutely wonderful little game. Unfortunately, I haven't played the original 7 Wonders, so I can't compare them, but this is a great game for 2 players. It's fairly simple to get into, and plays pretty fast, but is still very strategic.

At the moment of writing, I've played this four times with my wife, and she has won three of those games. I'm usually the better player between us when it comes to strategic games, but there just seem to be some factor in this game that she gets and I don't. (Need I say that this game is very high on her list of favourites?)

In short, this is a small and relatively fast game, that still has the feel of a much bigger and longer playing strategy game.

Update 2017-10-06: This is still a really good design, but I'm pretty bored with it by now. Adjusted rating accordingly.

It's...fine.  There are a few interesting decisions to be made, mainly in your various opportunities to deny your opponent cards they will need, or their opportunity to flip new cards.  However, I feel that the theme and grandiosity of the game is lost in every step of the process.  The game is a sea of icons, and the character of the cards and each players civ is lost to stacking and counting three wood, two glass, etc.  There's no excitement in building a grand majestic wonder, but simply in getting more icons.  When all the cards are a collection of icons, none of them are interesting, and neither is your civilization.  You don't win because you have a beautiful mecca of cultural pleasures, you win because you have more cards with a blue header.  It comes off as soulless.  Your civ will be indistinguishable from your opponents.  You do not build an engine, you do not take on a larger strategy, instead you spend each turn picking the best general option available and working your way towards an unlikely military/science victory or an entirely underwhelming and tedious points win.  This game fills a nice void of mildly complex two player games in the 30 minute playtime window, but I don't think it fills it well.

Great 2 player tableau builder. It is tense and full of surprises with antagonizing decisions. I just don't get the need to put aside 3 cards at each age. It's for randomizing purpose obviously but the different drafting structures and mix of face up and face down card is enough for this game. Waiting for certain resources or victory condition to realize it's not showing up is frustrating not fun.

I would rate this an 8 but material quality of the card is so bad (mine all came in pre-warped) that it actually makes me want to play it less. I feel like I'm slowly killing my game every time I play it and that I'm one game away from having to put condom on my cards.
Plus having to pay a premium price for those crappy cards. Usual fare from Repos, but still frustrating and bordering on Apple like arrogance.

RATING: 7
Very clever and vastly superior adaptation of 7 Wonders to a 2p format.

To duplicate the thrill of card drafting, cards in each age are laid out in a specific structure (such as a pyramid), some face down, with cards covering those higher up. Covered cards can't be taken, but visibility into what is coming (and what could be useful to the enemy) allows for long-term planning.

All of the other familiar 7 Wonders mechanisms are there, but with enough adaptation to work with two players (resources are always available to buy, for example, but if the opponent produces them then they become more expensive).

Additional thrills come from several immediate win conditions, such as scientific advancement or military power, and new abilities enabled by the new format (such as bonus turns).

There is already a vast improvement simply by virtue of the smaller number of players; it plays faster and is more strategic. All of its other little improvements are just icing on the cake.

It is a decent 2p games.  Player interaction is strong due to the supremacy victory paths, especially with 2 aggressive players.  It supports both tactical options and long term planning.

RATING: 10
45 minutes for a very deep two player game.  My wife can't get enough of thrashing me at this.  Love it.

I've upgraded this to be my only number 10.  I had a game the other night against my wife which was probably my most fun board gaming experience ever.  We got to the third age and I had three science symbols and she was one space from a military victory.  I had zero wonders and she had 3, with a repeat turn wonder as her fourth wonder.

As I was behind in military I got to go first.  I realised that every face down card could screw me and if there was a face up military that was hidden behind one card I was screwed.  Almost every move I made was going to blow me up.  I had a stack of cash and I went first and built every single wonder I had, removing at least one military card from the possibility of play.  It also took out my wife's ability to replay a turn.  One of those wonders allowed me to get a card from the discard pile, so I grabbed the once science card I didn't have (there was no military).  A turn in I acquired my fifth science card.

The entire age, my wife and I were planning out every move, counting all the cards left.  A face down non-guild card would annihilate us.

It came down to the last three cards.  There was one card that wasn't revealed and I had to reveal it.  There was still one third-age military card that hadn't been revealed.

And it flipped up favourably.  I was safe!  It was incredible.  The tension, the excitement, the planning and it came down to a 25% chance of being defeated right there and then.  I won by a civilian victory!  What a game.  What an incredible design.

I like 7 Wonders, and this game definitely feels like 7 Wonders for two players. It's really just unfortunate that the designer went with the "cards in formation on the table" form of drafting - it means that the cards needed to be really small, and that's (IMHO) a huge mark against Duel.

RATING: 9
Really tight little game, a fun and interesting 7 wonders game for 2. The only flaw I see are the military cards which just aren't worth purchasing unless you get them all (which is easy to prevent for your opponent).

Still a game that is very much worth getting, it's quite a tight drafting game.

RATING: 5
Could be a good two-player version of 7 Wonders. But I actually think it is better to run the original game (with a dummy for two players). There is too much luck in this game. Some cards are much better than others. The person who gets the best cards just gets more and more. Poorly balanced and not properly playtested is what I would say. It could perhaps be "fixed" by introducing a ton of house-rules but why bother? Just go back to the original game instead.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The card pyramid is AWFUL; it's a horrible, contrived mechanism in my opinion without real purpose. Often it results in a player having only one or two choices on his turn.  I like more choices and depth.  We've house-ruled this game to completely ditch the pyramid and allow card drafting a la Through the Ages -- cards are arranged in a line with some able to be purchased for free, then some for one gold, then some for two gold, and this line of cards shifts after each player's turn (with the ones at front recycled to the end of the line).  This opens up the game considerably and makes it VASTLY more strategic.  We've added other House Rules to fix other slight imbalances, especially considering that we also play with the expansion, but that is the main change.  Without our House Rules, I'd give this game a 5 or a 6.  With them, it's a 8 or 9, so I'll compromise and give the game a 7 rating.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Pros: Different paths to victory, somewhat unique, nice length, good amount of strategy.

Cons: Seems like going for Military and Science isn't the best strategy. 7 Wonders may be better.

Final thoughts: Think I still like the original slightly better. This is still great though and would rather play this two players than the normal 7 Wonders.

Majdhogynem tökéletesre sikeredett a játék. Felülmúlja a normál 7Csodát. Igen, szerencse van benne, de mégis izgalmas, feszített a játék, nagy újrajátszhatósággal. 10 parti után is izgalommal várom a következő mérkőzést. Remek döntési szituációk, talán ez adja az erejét. Kétfős játékból nehéz olyat csinálni, amire nem un rá hamar az ember. A 7W Duel egyenlőre ilyen.

Played this in a game night with Morels and Targi. This had my highest expectations but I found it rather mediocre. OK, it is a nice adaptation of the 7 Wonders game, but does away with (arguably) the best part of that game, which is the hand-drafting. Replacing it with some dull positional play which tries to imitate but simply cannot replace a good draft and has too much of an influence during play.

As I find 7 Wonders ok but am not too thrilled about it, this actually falls down from ok to mediocre and would definitely would play a lot of other 2p games over this one. I can see this game targeted to non/starting gamers with not so many games in their collection, as it is accessible, has some engine going in it, multiple scoring possibilities and big replayability. 

But I can see past the chrome and see a simple set collection game with artificial constricted choices and very few interaction (even less as in 7 Wonders). Pass.

I was a little worried about playing this after a pretty notoriously bad experience I had at a local gaming group with the parent version. But we are hard-pressed to overlook a well-regarded 2p game and I got it for a BGG Secret Santa (along with it's expansion, to be played at some other time).  The game was a tad fiddly and was close at the end but the tense gameplay as well as good match for playing time made for a good experience for us.

Ooh, this is a tricky little beast. The pyramid-like card selection is more clever than brilliant, but adds a nice tension and there are a lot of clever touches in the design that I like a lot - the risk of instant wins, the 'race' to 7 Wonders, the rebuilt science scoring - it all is exceptionally clever.

Two of my favourite designers deliver again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The game play is great, when combined with the expansion it's excellent, because the latter reduces the luck factor in the base game. The issue I have with this game, however, is that to have fun gaming experience playing this game, you have to find the right person. This is a very competitive game, in which you have to be mean to win. And obviously it is not so easy to be mean and have fun at the same time with every person you know. I would not, for example, play this quite often with my wife as she is a very serious person. The atmosphere usually gets weirdly serious and silent when we play it. But with the right person, poking fun at each other, it's just a wonderful game to play.

interesting 2-player variant of "7 Wonders" that provides a more competitive gameplay where decisions are much more impactful
Nice mechanical twist to turn the drafting from a hand of cards into drafting from a card structure on the table.

I like that the box is small, fitting because it's mostly a card game.

What is not so great?:
- rulebook not completely clear on some things
- science strategy a bit too difficult to succeed !? (Problem is most of the time it's a gamble if the other symbols are not under the 3 cards that stay in the box of each age. And scientific victory is a lot harder to achieve if the law medallion isn't under the five revealed medallions.)

After 8 games, most of the games feel a bit unbalanced.  It's not just the strategic draw of the cards that affect this unbalance, but the luck of the draw for which cards are revealed, can cause monopolies in several resources.  The game does try to balance this with yellow cards that reduce the cost, but not enough of a difference over the course of the game.  It's a good, but not great, 2-player game.

3/4/2017: This is probably one of the most played games that I currently have in my collection, though the play stat may not reflect that since I did not actively track my plays until recently. I really like the multiple paths to victory for this game which force both players to anticipate the path of victory selected by your opponent and keep him/her in check. The card drafting along with how the cards are being laid out differently in each ages are also interesting. 

The only problem that I have is every action you do, you will have to select and use one of the cards in the tableau. This presents a problem of knowing which cards you can potentially get or not. So, in a sense, you don't have much flexibility during the card drafting. Other than this, I completely love this game and will have its permanent place in my collection. :D

7 Wonders Duel is aptly named. This is not a case of two players merrily building their own civilizations and simply comparing scores at the end. Rather, its a game where every action can have great consequences for both players, and you definitely need to keep an eye on what your rival is doing. While the opportunities for directly affecting your opponent are fairly limited (a couple of wonders allow you to destroy one of your rival's resources and military attacks and some wonders can let you ding them for coins), the main card drafting mechanic is as much about what defense as it is building your own empire. It can, in fact, be a bit mean. Providing you have an opponent who knows it's all in fun, 7 Wonders Duel is about as deep, challenging and satisfying as a 30-minute game gets.

I think this is a definite improvement over 7 Wonders, with a few caveats.  One, the cards are super, super chintzy.  The "building" cards are small, thin, and weak, and the "wonder" cards were quite badly warped.  Two, the varying formations for the card set ups each age seem more gimmicky than innovative, and really just increase the footprint of the game and the awkwardness of setup.  

But, overall, there are definitely some clever design improvements here (I much prefer how military and science work, for example) and I like that the competition feels much more direct rather than passive.  Time will tell on this one.

This game does everything that I want a 2-player game to do. Fast play time, plenty of tough decisions, multiple end-game conditions, some slight asymmetry (after you build some wonders and science tokens).

To me it feels like the 7 Wonders equivalent of Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small. That game perfectly distilled Agricola down to a 20 minute, strategic 2-player experience. 7 Wonders: Duel does the exact same thing. It feels like 7 Wonders because of the way resources work and the card types are familiar (blue card give points, brown card resources, etc) but there are several enhancements that make it a much tighter, better 2-player experience.

I just don't rate this game higher for a couple of reasons. One if the start player advantage. To me the game just feels like there is a start player advantage because you can control the initial momentum of the game, and data posted on the forums shows a definite higher start player win rate. It seems like player two should start with one or two extra coins.

I also don't like that a player can control the game to get what they want. Since you and your opponent each have to remove a card on each turn, you can play in a way that you are guaranteed to get the science/military card that you need just based on how the cards are randomly laid out. That can be anticlimactic.

Update: The expansion seems to improve the game greatly and it addresses my second issue, where players are able to get the card they need most with no way to stop it. Now there is a new action that doesn't require you to remove a card, so you can stall and change up the order by taking that action.

The expansion also gives you incentive to reveal face-down cards. In the base game you would try to never do this because it might give your opponent the perfect card. But now some of the face-down cards have nice bonuses on them, and if you reveal the cards you get the bonuses. This is a great addition to the game.

After more plays with the expansion I feel like my rating could go up, making this the game I wanted it to be.

Happy to explore further, but it definitely won't dethrone Battle Line as the best 2-player quick card game available. I'm baffled at how this is rated higher than its multi-player predecessor.

Clever design had quite a bit of fun playing it against my daughter who had become quite a gun at 7 wonders. But when I feel like playing a two player game outside the war game genre this is not one I reach for as it doesn't quite have the depth of other games and you wish you were playing 7 wonder proper. Still a very good game that may well grab you more than it did me.

Favorite two player game yet for my wife and I. Has enough complexity to allow for multiple routes for victory but still simple enough to learn and teach quickly.

A compact civ builder with two player "drafting" mechanism and interlocking technologies, multiple ways to victory and in a small box sounds great and in practice works very nicely, too. Our first play was already quite solid, since actions are mostly thematically grounded. It gives a "Progress meets Jaipur" vibe. After 40 plays, the thing that makes this hit the table so many times is the super fast setup and fast play. It is a no-brainer to pick this for a quick game in the evening, especially when it is a work day and an involved game just doesn't cut it. And after allmost 90 plays, we still get surprise wins with science or overruns with military and the base game still feels fresh and fun.

A good way of playing the game with 2 people. The smaller pieces are a little too small for my liking and I am not a fan of the new "instant win" elements.

Pretty solid 2P re-implementation of 7 Wonders.  It plays super fast (20-30 minutes tops) and gives you some pretty interesting decisions to make.  Some good thoughts went into this.

This is just a fantastic design! It distills the magic of 7 wonders into a fantastic two player experience. The "pyramid solitaire" really works to create agonizing decisions.

Amazing game for 2 players. It's not only the 2p version of 7 wonders, but it creates fantastic duel experience during the building of the 2 cities, cause while every must score more victory points than the onther, there are the constants threats of militar victory and scientific one.

There is only one problem: the setup between ages breaks the game rythm a little bit.

Gives the 7 Wonders feeling in a 2-player game. The game plays fairly quick - though takes a while the first time around. The iconography makes the game language-independent but does mean you'll have to refer to the rule book during the first couple of games. Luckily, the back of the rule book explains all the icons, so you won't have to look far. 

This is definitely one of my new go-to 2-player games. 

Also own the expansion.

I've been sort of played out on regular 7 Wonders for a while now... especially as the one guy who likes to play it most wants to include a bunch of expansions every time.  And I don't often play 2 player board games (outside of Go which is it's own thing).  So I had a little trepidation about this game, but it was a convenient time for a two player game and it looked like it could be interesting.

There are a number of changes from the original, but the biggest is that it's not really a drafting game.  (There is a draft for wonders at the beginning of the game, but that's not a large part of the game).  Instead, cards are played in a special pattern to the table.  In the first era, the cards form a pyramid.  (See picture)

[ImageID=2558121]
Only cards that aren't covered by other cards can be taken.  You can either take a card, by paying for it, discard it for money (which works a little differently than the original game) or use it to build one of your wonder cards.  Some of the cards will be face down and will only be revealed when they become uncovered.

What this means is that there's a real dance sometimes, trying to avoid uncovering a card that your opponent wants.  Or trying to avoid uncovering the face down cards, as that might give your opponent first crack at some awesome cards.  In particular, there are a couple of ways that a player can just "win instantly" which relate to getting military or science cards... so in the late game if your opponent has pursued those paths, revealing an unknown card could prove to be deadly.  Since many of the cards will be face up, you can often plan ahead if there is a card you really want, or really want to deny your opponent.  I found this aspect of the game to be more compelling than the drafting mechanism in the original game.  It really worked quite well and made for an interesting game.

There were a couple of other important changes to mention.  When discarding a card for money, you get a base amount of 2 coins plus an extra coin for every yellow card in your tableau.  When buying a resource it costs a base 2 coins plus an extra coin for every good of that type that your opponent has that you don't.  So if you need a clay and your opponent produces 3 and you produce 1, then it'll cost you a base of 2 plus 2 more for the difference between your production and your opponent's production.  That money gets paid to the bank though, not to your opponent.  And you can always buy goods, even if neither you or your opponent make them.

Military works differently. There's a military track that works kind of like a reverse tug of war.  Whenever you play a military shield, you push the military marker closer to your opponent.  The further you push it towards him, the worse it is.  If you push far enough he loses first 2 coins, then 5 coins.  And if you push all the way to the end, you simply win the game immediately.  Failing that, you'll get points at the end of the game depending on how far you pushed the marker.  There are three levels you can achieve 2 pts, 5 pts and 10 pts.

Science works completely differently as well.  There's not set collection scoring wonkiness.  Some of the cards give you points, but mostly just piddly amounts.  There's still a set collection aspect though.  There's 6 different types of symbols.  If you ever collect 2 of the same type, you get to take one of the science bonus tokens that are in play in that game.  And if you ever collect all 6 symbols, then you just win immediately.  (There's a seventh symbol on one of the science bonus tokens that makes this a bit easier too).  Each game will have 5 of 10 of those tokens in play, so there's some randomness on what will be in any particular game.

The different eras get laid out in different card configurations.  A pyramid in era 1, a reverse pyramid in era 2 and a weird egg shaped thing in era 3.  In each era, three cards are randomly removed from the game, so you can't always count on every card being available.

The game was a lot of fun.  It felt very similar to 7 Wonders but also very fresh and different.  I'm not sure that it would be that easy for a new player, who hadn't played 7 Wonders, to pick up though.  But for those who know the original game, this won't be too difficult to learn.

About [thing=173346][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=173346][/thing] is a reimplementation of [thing=68448][/thing] for 2 players only. Sure, [thing=68448][/thing] do have 2 players rules, using the Free City, and I played with them and they work OK. Still, if you truly want a very good 2p game, [thing=173346][/thing] is your thing.

[thing=173346][/thing] has the same feel of [thing=68448][/thing]: 3 Eras, several types of cards (scientific, civic, military, production, etc) and cards have requirements you need to pay and "chains" of buildings, so if you have and earlier version, you get for free the upgrade. Is a well known and proven mechanic, and is what you will get here. But [thing=173346][/thing] come with several changes: there isn't a draft phase anymore, as all the cards for the Era are in the table, some hidden, some open, and players can't take the hidden ones before they are open. Also, every player has 4 Wonders to build. Finally, the game can end in three ways: by finishing the cards of the 3rd Era, by Scientific victory and by Military victory.

[thing=173346][/thing] can go in a briskly pace and end in less than 20 minutes, and even longer games won't break too much the 30 minutes.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
After picking the Wonders, in the turn the player can:
- Build a card (paying its costs, if any);
- Build a Wonder (paying its costs);
- Discard a card for money.

That is it. The cards for the Eras are set in a way that the cards in the base row are open, then there is a row of hidden cards, blocked by the open ones bellow, and the cards are revealed only when there isn't a card blocking it.

Players can buy all kinds of goods, but they pay 2 plus the level of production of the opponent - so if I want glass, and my opponent produces 2 glass, I need to pay 4 to the bank, for each glass I need. To balance this, when you sell a card for money, you get 2 money plus one money for each yellow (merchant) card you have in your tableau.

Scientific cards don't earn points as they used to, now they can earn you science tokens, that have some strong powers, and can be a way to win the game. Military can earn points, even if you don't conquer the enemy city (miltary victory), and also causes your opponent to lose money, which can be really bothersome.

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
What to build. Not only what you need, but what the other player wants. Military and Scientific victories won't just happen, so you need to start going for them right from the start, and even if you aren't going for them, leave the cards for the other side might lead you to defeat.

So there is a good balance of strategic and tatical decisions, for both sides - more than that of [thing=68448][/thing], as the 2 players limit makes the luck go down, as either you or the opponent will take certain card.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Smart, smooth and engaging mechanics;
- Quick playing time;
- Several paths to victory;
- Superb presentation, artwork and bits, all in a very reasonable sized box;
- Easy to learn, teach and play;
- Icons and symbols are mostly easy to understand;
- Mostly indirect interaction (like raising the costs of a resource);
- Language independent;
- Seems to have a good replay value, with not all Wonders being used, nor all the cards, and the order (and if in the open or hidden rows) in which the cards come also affect the game.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- 2 players only;
- Still, like in basic [thing=68448][/thing], not all that thematic;
- Mostly indirect interaction (raising the costs of a resource; bloking);
- There are Wonders that aren't Wonders but are, at least, nice.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Sort like playing an abstract, but not so thinky, as there is luck and hidden information, so while there is room for some AP, it won't be as bad as someone looking for the "perfect move".

Since there is more blocking and indirect conflict than anything else (there are some Wonders that, when built, destroy production cards of the opponent, but that is it), it won't hurt feelings of those playing, which is an important feature considering couples playing often.

In the end, even I, a person that doesn't like competitive 2 players game, not only don't mind having played it, I actively enjoyed! [thing=173346][/thing] proved itself to me as a very good option in the 2 players field, and if happens with it what did with [thing=68448][/thing], which got better with expansions (Leaders and Cities), I can see this even improving in the future.

RATING: 7
7 Wonders: Duel is an engine-building game based on card drafting. Because there are only two players, often the best move is taking away a card that would help your opponent more than you, rather than simply building up your own engine. This is central in the two push-pull objectives (military and science) to keep your opponent in check.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I think I like it better than the original but it still suffers from some of the same problems. And it needs more variety so you don't see almost all the cards every time. Like its predecessor it does not feel like you're building a civilization, just a tableau of cards.

I am definitely not a huge fan of the regular version of 7 Wonders, and because of that I came very close to missing this release. Which would have been a tragedy. Duel is fantastic, and easily one of the premier 2-player games out there.

Although not as quick to pick up as something like Jaipur or Lost Cities, Duel rewards the longer learning curve with greater variance. The solitaire-y set-up for each age is fantastic and can lead to some really sweaty decisions. 

So all in all, a longer learning and playtime than you'd expect from a 2-player card game, but well worth it. More fun than 7 Wonders in my opinion.

No doubt the best game in 2015. Incredibly well polished and balanced, a very rare improvement over big brother what was very good game itself. Science is the wining strategy in most cases, military is good alternative when opponent is short of money. Maybe guilds are a little bit boring but seems as designers decision to avoid extra randomness. It's hard to believe that such perfect game can be improved by expansion. But let's wait and see...

Edit: expansion disappointed, sold it.

Absolutely love the game, never played such an complex and "pure" strategy game, yet it's very easy to learn and takes no time to play. Easily the best game i own. The reason it didn't get 10 stars was that it sometimes feels to short, and i can sometimes miss the randomness that suddenly can turn the tables and make the game more fun. But it isn't fair to measure a game for what it isn't. This isn't a random and crazy game like munchkin is. This is a highly strategic and easy to learn game, and it fits it's role perfectly.

This game completes 7 Wonders by providing a two player experience.  Unfortunately, the puzzle drafting system adds an unnecessary fiddley aspect that I dislike.  Games may evolve into an experience of who can math out the draft order better rather than the pure draft and build mechanic of its predecessor.  I would play it again but could live without ever playing it again.

Good
-For a wide audience
-Plays quickly
-Strategy to time ratio is great
-Always an interesting decision to make
-Drafting wonders gives you a loose stragegy to start the game
-Iconography is very familiar to those who've play 7 Wonders

Bad
-Forced to manually track your opponent's victory points
-Science seems underpowered
-Sometimes games are already decided and you are forced to go through the motions
-Not a gateway game

Overall:
This is likely my favorite two-player game right now.  The games are always tight and challenging while not feeling long or too heavy.  While not quite a gateway game, this is an accessible two-player game that has enough meat to keep you coming back.

Superb, Excellent strategic depth.  Chase a military victory, civilian, or scientific win while opposing the other player.  Fairly easy game to teach.  30 to 45 minute play time.  Requires a fairly large play area to lay out all the cards -- I don't recommend playing on a picnic table at a windy beach.

There is a solo variant available for this game under the BGG files section.  It works, but the game loses a lot in comparison to a human opponent.

I have never played the original multi-player edition.

RATING: 7
A game about taking a card which flips over all the cards you need so your opponent uses one of them to build a wonder that gives him another turn so he can take that other card you need and sell it for peanuts, leaving you with your head in your hands. It's good!

With some more cards for added variety it could have been a 9 for me. I am no fan of buying expansions just to get some variety. A base game should include that - at least to get a better rating from me.

RATING: 8
Was surprised I enjoyed this version so much given my lukewarm feelings for the original 7 Wonders. The drafting mechanism improves on what was already my favourite part of the original game, and the tension of whether to reveal a new card or not is great.

Pretty easy to teach and relatively quick to play given the amount of strategy I feel I get out of the game.

RATING: 6
There is a familiar feel to playing Duel and regular 7 Wonders. The designers have done a good job keeping the original theme and feel of the game play. Players select instead of draft cards, but the goal remains more or less the same: to accrue points in multiple categories to win the game. The introduction of sudden death victories in science and military conquest helps shake things up, but you can see these scenarios a mile away and can easily prevent your opponent from scoring these victories.

My rating remains low as the game is mediocre at best. Player interaction is limited to denial of choice and in our plays, building is too easy and cheap. Almost every single building we wanted to build could be purchased or built without too much difficulty. So the game really boils down to card selection which is heavy on luck. It doesn't feel quite right when you can pick up Civilian buildings that score lots of VP at a lucky flip of the card and without any "costs". Wonders are also a piece of cake to build for the most part. We often finish building all the Wonders by the end of Age II. 

One positive note: the game is really low key and spouse-friendly. Though many claim it is too "take-that". I really do not think so. The game is relatively light with very little decision-making as most of the time, the choices are quite obvious. Sure, you may take a card just to deny your opponent points, but I hardly think it is vicious. 

The game is fine, just that my expectations were high due to the hype and positive response from BGG. In the end, I was fairly disappointed.

MARAVILHOSA adaptação de 7Wonders para 2 jogadores. Nunca cheguei a jogar o "pai maior" com apenas 2, mas pelo q li da regras e oq me disseram, sempre me pareceu "gambiarrado" demais. Aqui as regras foram adaptadas perfeitamente. E mesmo as regras mudadas sem razão aparente, a princípio, acabaram melhorando o jogo. A maior importância, por exemplo, para o dinheiro e as cartas amarelas foram ótimas. De cara "torci o nariz" para o fato de cada jogador não ter "a maravilha",  parecia descaracterizar o "7 wonders", mas depois, pensando bem, de fato 7 Wonders só tem 7 maravilhas com 7 jogadores, enquanto Duel.... Sempre tem 7 maravilhas passíveis de construção, então ele é o verdadeiro 7W rsrs
E oq já era ótimo como gateway, ficou ainda melhor, pq agora o "novato" não precisa mostrar suas cartas para tirar alguma dúvida, pois as cartas estão abertas para os dois. A única coisa realmente "perdida" foi o inovador fator "escravos de jó" de 7 Wonders, mas q foi substituído por algo igualmente diferente, a distribuição única das cartas a cada era.
Enfim, um jogo fantástico, "redondinho", pronto pra entrar no top 10 de qualquer um.

RATING: 4
There are no real choices except for the obvious, so it really depends on the luck of the draw who will win. 

Maybe I am wrong, any top 10 game has something astounding isn’t it? Unfortunately my opinion hasn’t changed. Again I was lucky that the cards I needed most appeared right in time and my opponent wasn’t able to do anything against that. He built three of his Wonders and made it virtually impossible for me to build mine due to a lack of bricks. Early in the third era I completed a collection of six science and ended the game. 

Conclusion: 7 Wonders Duel presents itself as a strategic game but is very light, luck driven and themeless. And way too long for what it is.

I feel like the replay value isn't as high as I would like but the game itself is very solid and most importantly it is not difficult to learn the basics.  This fits a nice filler for 2 players while waiting for more players to arrive to a game night but if you have only 2 players who will be playing each other over and over this isn't the game you want to fill most of the time but can pull out occasionally.

There are so many better games out there.  I bought this originally because it was a game designed for 2P and I mostly play 2P.  Made sense, right?  However, I've come to realize in the past year that there are tons of games that play up to 4-5P that play just as well, if not better, with 2.  Most games have special rules for playing with 2P and in many cases those rules make the game work fine.  There's no need to limit yourself to 2P games and, once you consider all the other games out there, this one really starts to fall short.

My cards also started showing bad wear after just 3 plays of this (without anyone being rough with the cards), so if you're buying this make sure you immediately buy sleeves.  Otherwise you'll have earmarked cards that are easy to spot even when face down.

Original, Dec 2016:
I don't think this is my favorite 2 player game, but it's not a bad game.  It has a little more complexity to it than Jaipur, with multiple paths to victory.  It plays out very fast despite having a lot to think about, which makes it a nice filler around heavier games.

While the art is nice, I don't feel like the theme pulls off as well as I'd like.  The rule book is also very confusing in some areas and it took us several tries (and some videos) to figure out how to play.  It doesn't feel as challenging as it could.  One play through I was able to construct all 4 wonders (in the first age!) before my boyfriend had any.  I then just focused on military and ended up winning by a large margin.

I really enjoyed the possibility of multiple paths to victory in this game, as well as the timing of when to complete the wonders. Nevertheless, I felt that for a card game on the lighter side, there were some layers of complexity that weren't strictly necessary, to the point where, if I had the choice, I would either go for something lighter but, in my view, more enjoyable, or for something a bit heavier but with a similar theme.

We play mostly 2 player games. 7 Wonders never really hit the table unless we had more people due to the fact that I typically do not like robot players in a game for 2. Seems tacked on when you need to add that element for two players. Then comes 7 Wonders Duel, a fully fleshed out two player game that adds even more flexibility to the original with a really cool take on the drafting mechanic from the original game. Highly recommend this if you like 7 Wonders and are looking for a made for 2 player version.

This game is so smooth and tense, and easily my favourite 2-player only game. You constantly have to balance the choice of what card you pick for yourself, and what cards you make available to your opponent. Every game feels different enough that once I play this, I would like to go again and again and again. 3 different paths to victory ensures enough strategic depth, while making every round a tough tactical choice.

Talk about the penultimate spouse game- thus its popularity. The learning curve is smoothed considerably by having previously played 7 Wonders, but without that prior knowledge the extent of rules overhead for such a shallow game would be astronomical. Which is yet another reason why this the opposite of my type of game- I like games where complexity emerges from simple rules, not the other way around. The best aspect of the design to me were the sudden death victory conditions, which add a bit of tension to the affair, but by and large this is just mundane drafting and more drafting with a side order of engine building. Lacking an auction or spatial element (along with shared incentives my favorite mechanics in games), Duel was never going to be up my alley.

A great 2P implementation of 7 Wonders! This one feels a bit more strategic to me than its big brother.  With 7 Wonders, I feel I generally focus on my own civilization and don't often pull cards to deprive my neighbors of them.  With Duel, your need to focus on building your own civilization but also  on keeping certain cards away from your opponent and hopefully forcing them to be the one to reveal the facedown cards.

This is an excellent two player variant of the original game. Components are ideal for travel and/or situations where space is limited. Straight forward to understand, plays fairly quickly in about half an hour, with lots of insteresting choices to make and limitless replayability. A must have for the two-player category.

Enjoying it so far, just a few plays in. Science is more luck-based than I'd prefer, but otherwise it's solid fun. Lots of dilemmas at every turn, which is the essence of a good game.

Overall I'd rather play 7W, but this is a clever reworking.

By far, My favorite 2 player casual board game.  I love that it gives me the feeling of 7 wonders, but with 2 people.  the idea of having blind card that you don't know what's coming up and what you could potentially flip over for your opponent is awesome.  It's just such a fun game that is great and really makes you think.

[i]Rating with the Pantheon expansion added to the base game (7/10 without the expansion).[/i]

The base game on its own is just a solid design (I was never THAT enamored with it to be honest). But once you add the Pantheon expansion Duel becomes a whole different beast, the decision tree becomes much wider and the gameplay becomes less predictable and linear.

Duel has some great new features (as compared to its older brother) - I love the special abilities granted by science tokens, they are a really nice touch and I would love to see them retroactively implemented into the original 7 Wonders.

One word of warning though - keep in mind that Duel has a lot of "take that" moments, some folks may not enoy that. If you want a peaceful game definitely stick to the classic 7 Wonders. 

[b]/update, January 2018[/b]: I've traded my copy away, my significant other didn't enjoy this game all that much so there was no point in keeping it in my collection (Duel is too casual for my gaming group).

[EDIT] just a few games after, almost all with improbable opponents (a 5 years old son with a 10 years old adviser, an english teacher, a colleague...) and i must tell you i am deeply in love with this game. This is one of those games i can truly say "I would have liked to create it". It has everything i adore in a game: simple, fast, deep, everchanging, intense, tough decisions, different paths to victory. I DO LOVE THIS GAME.

------------------
One of the best 2-p games i have ever tried! Rich, detailed yet simple, very tense, with many different ways to reach final victory... all in a reasonable time.
Fantastic. I'll play it anytime i can.
Rating could definitely increase much higher.

RATING: 3
Unsatisfying follow-up to the sensational card drafting experience. There was so much potential here with cleverly expanded trade rules, card placement for draft picks and solidly maintained iconography. Sadly this game has fallen flat with almost everyone I've played it with based on the idiotic "skip turn" symptom attached to building half of the wonder cards. Taking bonus turns from fulfilling the resource order requirements on wonder cards is so slanted in favour of the player who gets to these first, that in unsettles almost all games of Duel. Whoever thought this was a good idea needs to be taken out to the barn and shot! One of few games I've researched, bought, played, taught and had to flip. Stick to the original game, it's still  one of the best.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I had watched lots of reviews and play throughs of 7 Wonders: Duel before playing it, but I had a very strong feeling that I'd like it, and I can report back that I was right. Go me. 

Take all of the tension of playing 7 Wonders and ratchet it up a bit as it's a lot clearer how the other player is doing. Then add in a few additional ways to win (or lose) and now you're balancing a few things in an attempt to stay afloat. Do you go for the military win and crush your opponent? Or do you go enlightened and go for the science victory? Then again, maybe you stick it out and go for points. All of those are viable, you just have to decide what you're going to do.

Solid 2-player interpretation of its big brother, that has the same feel yet has completely different mechanics. This game however is overshadowed by its high luck factor. In most games you'll see an opponent's move coming three or four steps ahead and there's nothing you can do about it. I've seen people get slaughtered just because they couldn't get a resource card to save their lives. Usually the winner is already determined by the end of the first age, and that is a major drawback if you're only 1/3 into the game.

This is my preferred version of 7 Wonders. I much prefer the fast play time, open play, control, and back-and-forth draft process.  Hard decisions and timing dilemmas and being forced to reveal cards come up fast. You can set up chess like timing and anticipate which way your opponent will go to setup a card deeper in the pyramid. The extra actions of wonders add a great unexpected element for big moves.

Infinitely better than it's predecessor 7 Wonders. Duel takes a boring drafting game and introduces mechanics that make it something interesting and more strategic. Having the most points is still how you win, but you also have to pay attention to other aspects of the game so you don't instantly lose, because then it doesn't matter how many points you have.

RATING: 8.34
Two-player variant of 7 Wonders.  The card drafting works differently; instead of the ‘take one card, pass the rest on’ card drafting of the main game, you will have a solitaire-style layout of cards in front of both players and you can only pick up cards that are not currently covered by any other card, which feels more interesting.   There is one less standard resource (ore) and one less luxury resource (textiles) than in the base game.

My first play of 7 Wonders Duel with the expansion. 

This one is tough to rate. I really enjoy 7 Wonders Duel. It's a great light-to-middleweight filler game to close out a night or fill time while waiting for others to arrive. While it isn't much of an engine builder (in fairness, what could be at the 30 playtime), the "sudden death" victory conditions add some really nice tension/decisions to card drafting. 

While the expansion adds some additional depth to the game (you can take an action that doesn't burn a card to try playing with the order you open up new cards for your opponent), it also felt like the game became more fiddly. Sure it gives you a bonus for uncovering cards (which was previously generally negative as it gives your opponent a choice of a previously-unknown card). But I'm not sure the expansion adds any can't-miss mechanics and certainly costs time in rules explanation, setup, and looking up rules.

I probably wouldn't play without it as I put everything in the base game box. Still, I wouldn't rate this as a slam dunk, can't miss expansion.

This offers an interesting concept but not a good implementation of 7 Wonders for 2 players.  In the game we played, both players were unable to get access to the resources they needed to pay for most cards and half their wonders, so we ended up discarding cards for money simply because no other option was possible.  We had over 60 gold between the 2 of us.  As if that wasn't bad enough, there are cards that force players to lose resources so now you have practically guaranteed this will happen for the majority of games.  That's dumb and a terrible way to play 7 Wonders.

Play [thing=140098]7 Wonders: Empires[/thing] instead.

Positives: Excellent production, lots of depth for such a little game, strategic without being too much for its size, various winning strategies, lots of fun, plays in just the right amount of time, great value for money.

Negatives:  Perhaps the science route to victory is too difficult and only the points/military is viable, which is a shame 

Conclusion: Excellent 2 player game with a solid theme, good structure, approachable at all levels and plays in just the right amount of time for its weight

5 after 1 play

The original 7 Wonders 2-player variant is significantly better than this game. Player interaction is substantially lower and gameplay feels much less strategic. The military and scientific automatic victory conditions are hard to achieve, since it is a to-and-fro kind of game mechanic, making them seem almost superfluous. Artwork and game component quality are good.

RATING: 7.9
Great game with some real tension in the balance of win conditions. Solves the problem of wanting a solid two player version of 7 Wonders, happy with this one.

We've played 9 games so far and quite a few games have been decided by the luck of card flips. Starving opponents of resources seems to be an oft visited strategy in our games as we draft brown and grey cards really highly in the opening 2 ages. Sometimes one person gets well ahead on resources which punishes the other player considerably. It is a short game however so this eases the frustration. The past three games seem to have been more balanced and I think we're getting better at drafting Wonders controlling the board and making better choices - the games are really close when they go to points.

Advantages
+ Fast turns make it a very back and forth 2 player game
+ Multiple win conditions
+ Good expansion

Disadvantages
- Resource screw
- Iconography
- Card quality

Great 2 players game. Quite deep, interesting and challenging. I would say however that you happen to just take the cards that are available to you, so it's not like the game allows you to entirely focus on one specific strategy. You can stick to one but it all comes down to what's available on the table. Otherwise I like the pace of the game and the fact it is not complex.

RATING: 8
Tense and fun! I really like the different paths to victory (and how they feel distinct - not just three linear tracks), having to adapt to the changing cards available, and the need to pay attention to your opponent's tableau. Agonising at times to weigh up the benefit of a card you need vs what you can deny someone else by taking/trashing one they need.

RATING: 7
It looks like 7 Wonders... its resources work like 7 Wonders... and its card layout does an admirable job of recreating drafting for 2 players... but ultimately something feels quite different here.  I think a lot of it is me not being able to change strategies to handle the new wonder powers and collection focus for the new cards very quickly.  I ultimately think Duel is probably a better game as there is simply more to consider with every move and I like that about it but it will take me some more plays to see if I actually like playing it better.

A 7 csoda kétfős verziója. Nehéz belejönni, kb a 3. játéktól kezd tudatos lenni, mit miért csinálunk, de izgalmasabb az alpjátéknál. Pláne, ha a kiegészítő Pantheon játékot is bevetjük.

RATING: 9
I love the ancient theme of 7 Wonders, and the card-drafting structure in this 2-player variant adds so much strategy. You really have to plan your picks with the next couple in mind to get the cards you want- and even then, there are always ones that are flipped over and hidden that bring in an element of chance. The scores are usually very close at the end, and this just feels like a well-balanced, thinking game- my favorite kind!

I tried a couple od times but it didnt grab me so much. There are plenty of difficult decissions and tense moments but compared with the original I felt more like I was playing chess, which is not so great for me.

RATING: 10
Excellent drafting game where even seemingly passive decisions such as gaining a resource affects your opponent. Scientific and military victories create an interesting dynamic where you are rewarded for attempting them while not eliminating you for failing them.

The Pantheon expansion is worth getting the base game feels complete.

RATING: 7
It's really well balanced and everything integrates perfectly. After 9 plays it's starting to feel a tad samey, and its one of the few games where losing bothers me for some reason. Still, a really good super filler which offers compelling gameplay in a short amount of time.

RATING: 9
A 2p version of the 7 Wonders. Cleverly incorporates three different win conditions (Science accumulation, Military advancement, or victory points) and card drafting from the bottom of an intermittently face-down solitaire-pyramid.

It's odd...this can function as a very light game, but it also has the capacity to be incredibly thinky.  Marvelous.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Kinda boring, samey, just building stuff, lots of arranging of cards. Instead of the draft you layout cards in different formations depending on the Age, felt very forced. This game was designed for 7 people.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Once you start paying attention to manipulating how the cards come out of the layout, and keep yourself sufficiently solvent to have options, this game is fun; however, your opponent getting 5 turns in a row will depress you every time… until you win in the last 4 cards! Pretty fun!

Letto diverse volte il regolamento. Il gioco mi piace devo ancora provarlo sul campo essendo la versione per due giocatori!
Ok provato in data odierna 4 novembre 2016, due partite, bello, molto veloce a dispetto di un setup che sembra lungo. Ottimo, promosso... Dopo vari mesi lo considero un gioco TOP per due giocatori. Lascio i precedenti commenti per mio storico promemoria :-)

RATING: 2
After 6 plays. We don't understand why this game seems to work for most people but not for us. We feel that this game is essentially a fight for resources, both for yourself to be able to pay the cards, but perhaps even more importantly to deprive the other player. In about 2/3 of the time, this ended in an imbalance, where one player had (sometimes a lot) more resources than the other,  leaving the other person with a frustrating experience, because (s)he could hardly do anything. Without enough (or the right) resources you can't build cards, you are forced to often dump cards for money, you can't build your wonders, etc. Perhaps if we played 10 more times we could learn how to play so that you always get your fair share of the resources, but it's simply not worth it for us. There are too many games out there that do work for us right out of the box.

A truly excellent small box 2 player game. Plays quickly, and is always enjoyable. There are 2-3 decisions you need to make each turn and there is always a nice level of uncertainty. What cards am i revealing for my opponent? Will he take this card or that card? 

Each game can feel different. For example last night my opponent had 3 wonders with the "take another action" icon. That was a fantastic play but i still managed to win. Quite memorable sessions for such a short game. I usually ignore Scientific and Military victories and it has cost me quite a few times. 

The more i play games the less i want to do math problems. However, i still want to feel that i am making meaningful decisions. 7 Wonders Duel is one such game.

Much better than the original for two players. Awesome tableau builder with a lot of back and forth. Each move is agonizing with many things to consider, yet it is very simple and easy to pick up. The new card design is also a vast improvement. At first I disliked the mini cards, but you don't really handle them and they save a lot of space making me a convert for them being the best choice.

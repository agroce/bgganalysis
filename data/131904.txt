Clever deck builder with the interesting twist of aiming to get your Princess candidate on the vacant throne before anyone else. Lovely presentation, but don't let the kawaii graphics fool you. Depending on the cards selected, the game can be ruthlessly cutthroat. Lots of variety and replayability, especially with the two expansion packs. But just the basic game is an excellent offering. Highly recommended.

Downpoints
* 1/4 of the cards have translation mistakes
* Princess cards are unbalanced with some not worth going for at all
* Provided coins just seemed to drag out the game and are not that helpful.
* The stage where you switch from buying to point gathering is very important and creates an unfairness to new players that isn't as prevolant in other deckbuilders

Other
The way the line is filled is interesting and potentially limits access to some cards early on, but has good and bad points to this mechanic.

Game was ok, but there are far better produced and more streamlined games of this genre out there.

It is just another Dominion clone used as a vehicle to peddle cute anime maids. Don't get me wrong, I really dig the cutesy artwork, but I would be remiss to have my eyes deceive me into thinking the game is doing anything special. It is engaging to play since building a deck is always a great hook, yet the way the game lay out is quite clunky.

Forced my group who can't read japanese to play it. Personal favourite deck builder, smooth and simple.

It provide a longer and more satisfying game play which require some strategic choices along with slight randomness of the market. I also enjoy it more than other deck builder in the same genre due to the fact that it is without the arbitrary game end condition (dominion style, x deck depleted). 

Lastly, another Pro is that you can rarely end the game in a sudden without other player noticing what you're planning for, which helps keeping the game tense and exciting.

Yet another dominion clone that adds very little if anything to the genre. Slight different pace from Dominion owing to the Backing mechanic, and the Territory Keep/Take mechanic is a marginal improvement on the formula (although Dominion introduced this mechanic in expansions anyways). Will revise rating after playing with more than 2.

Initial Impressions: played this game with a setup with 5 attack cards and no defense cards so the game took way too long, but without such cards I imagine I would really like this game, probably my 4th favorite deckbuilder out of the about 20 I've played. What makes Dominion my favorite deckbuilder are the fact it negates the rich get richer problem many newer deckbuilders have by clogging your deck with victory cards, it has strategic rather than tactical card buying with the static stacks, it plays relatively short, cards are mostly pretty balanced, the limited actions and buys means you can't spam buy just one card (usually), and the strong enginebuilding feel. 

Heart of Crown is only net neutral in terms of rich get richer (the money cards you lose for buying a princess is roughly counteracted by your princesss's power, and victory cards only clog up your deck for one or two cycles) and the card interactions at least of the ones I played with didn't feel as nuanced in combos to give as strong an engine building feel as Dominion, but otherwise it excelled in Dominion's strengths. The weird 10 types of cards but a couple aren't out at a time is a little fiddly for what it adds, but still allows strategic card buying while adding some of the worry that you need to buy this now before it disappears in dynamic buy rows. With only a couple attack cards I could definitely see this game going as quick as Dominion. All the cards I played with felt viable and maybe one felt too strong early game but weakened later. There are limited actions.

However the addition of the mechanism of backing the princesses adds some much needed theme to Dominion, and I really like how each one gives you a special power.

Another Dominion clone with small differences, the most important of which (cards available to be bought arrive randomly during the game) kills any long term planning, making the game less strategic and more random (typical "reveal the good card for the next player" situation).

Basically a clone of Ascension, which itself is an inferior clone of Dominion.
Doesn't have nearly as much replayability as either of those.  It has some interesting ideas that other deck builders don't have -- like the game having different stages before and after supporting a princess -- but card screw is as serious a concern as it is in Ascension.

This is a very cool deck-builder, it as some different ideas on how to play the cards (you can say it's almost the same thing of getting more actions with dominion for example) but it feels different.
Also, the way the market works in this game is pretty interesting. 
The game flows because turns are quick and you are engaged to see what others are doing.
The art is gorgeous!

Heart of Crown ist ein Deckbuilder, auf den ich mich im Vorfeld schon sehr lange gefreut habe. Den Kickstarter hatte ich seinerzeit leider verpasst und so blieb die Vorfreude auf den regulären Release und den Pick-up in Essen. 
Was soll ich sagen, Heart of Crown ist an vielen Stellen ein klassischer Deckbuilder, der viele Mechaniken von Dominion übernimmt. Es gibt einen zentralen Markt, viele modulare Kartensets und natürlich erweitert man sein kleines Startdeck, während des laufenden Spiels immer weiter. Der besondere Aspekt von Heart of Crown, ist die Siegbedingung. Grundsätzlich geht es erstmal nicht um Siegpunkte, sondern im Laufe des Spiels, kommt irgendwann der Zeitpunkt, an dem man sich für eine der sechs offen liegenden Prinzessinnen entscheidet und diese unterstützt. Alle Prinzessinnen haben dabei individuelle Vorteile und die ausgewählte Thronanwärterin wandert in die eigene Spielzone (hier "Domain" genannt). Ab diesem Zeitpunkt hat man eine weitere Aktionsmöglichkeit: Anstatt neue Karten aus dem Markt zu kaufen, kann man sogenannte "Succession"-Karten aus seiner Hand in die eigene Domain legen. Diese Karten geben "Krönungs"-punkte und davon gilt es 20 zu sammeln, um seine eigene Prinzessin zur Königin auszurufen. Schafft man dies schneller als die Gegenspieler, hat man gewonnen. Dieser neue Aspekt bringt frischen Wind ins Deckbuilder-Genre und ergänzt sich perfekt mit dem klassischen Mechaniken von Dominion. Die unterschiedlichen Kartensets erlauben mal mehr und mal weniger Interaktion zwischen den Spielern. Hier empfehle ich sehr schnell (nach Partie 2-3) die Angriffs- und Verteidigungskarten ins Spiel zu nehmen. Das Setting von Heart of Crown ist ein klassisches Fantasy-Thema mit Anime Artwork. Allerdings ist dieses hier sehr dezent gehalten, so dass auch Spieler, die mit Anime sonst überhaupt nichts anfangen können, hier bedenkenlos mitspielen und Spaß haben können.

A blatant copy of Dominion, where all differences were artificially created ("This is like Dominion, but different because this rule is instead implemented in that way"). The only "new" addition is the idea to represent the "+actions" as with visual arrows. Stay away from this one.

Dominion + variable player powers, in fast forward. You start the game going for money to declare a candidate for coronation (they're all 6, which is the same as a dominion 6)who comes with a special ability, and once she's declared, you try to cycle the VP cards out of your deck and attach them to your candidate (your buy phase is either buy or attach vp). A lot of cards are word-for-word dominion copies, but the candidate mechanic makes it feel very different.

Hmm... while this game has a lot in common with Dominion, the overall structure of the game is completely different from Dominion, and creates a completely new experience.  The "set" mechanism is similar to that of placing a card in reserve in A Few Acres of Snow, and it adds a lot of strategy.  The way the cards come out is also awesome, it reminds me of how technologies come out in Eclipse. 

While this game borrow A LOT from Dominion, it also adds a lot, and is really fun.

RATING: 7.5
Most deckbuilders feel about the same to me, and as such I'm usually willing to play them but don't seek them out. This one changed up just enough that it didn't feel too samey. Has two arcs to the game (before/after backing a princess), timing it so you have good enough territory to save some decent cards for every turn, and them foregoing your buy to play succession cards in the second half.

The artwork is great in this one, although the card text could probably have been trimmed, especially since they went with the odd choice of basing the font size on the amount of text (some of those cards the text was sooo tiny). Japanime could probably have gotten away with having more succinct text and a more wordy clarification in the manual.

I also thought that the arrows pointing out telling you how many more cards you can play was a clever addition, since you and your opponents can visually see how many actions you have left, as opposed to Dominion you either have to really be paying attention or have your opponent telegraph the results of every card play (or just trust them).

RATING: 9
An interesting clone of Dominion with several twists that makes it different enough to be a separate game.   More choices are presented in the game, but it doesn't take longer to play.  The nomination/sucession system makes the game very exciting throughout, rather than the anti-climax "rush to buy all the provinces once someones starts" like you see in Dominion.

A cross between Dominion, Core Worlds, and Star Realms.

You build up your deck by buying from a non-fixed market whose contents can change and eventually have to back a princess and build her a realm. Once you have done that you can start removing succession cards from your deck to score. 

Since its a Japanese game it comes with the obligatory cute girls on the artwork. On the 'overly sexy' scale it's far below Barbarossa and slightly below Tanto Cuore so if you find the artwork offensive then you are being offended for the sake of being offended and have some serious insecurity and social issues.

First play impression: seems like a really good deckbuilder.

You tend to have plenty of things to do on your turn and you can go through your whole deck quickly. Once you start buying victory point cards you can easily remove them from your deck the first time they show up (while still getting the points).

I was initially concerned about the sudden death aspect at the end of the game but it seems like it won't be an issue as the game shouldn't last much longer once you're at that point. Basically once someone declares that they have enough points to win the game, each other player gets one turn to see if they can also get enough points. If no one else can do it, then the first person is the winner. If other players have enough points, though, everyone else is eliminated and the "winners" keep playing to see who can get to 30 points first. The player elimination isn't ideal, but at that point in the game everyone's deck should be good enough that getting those extra points won't take long.

The market is also a little weird. It's similar to Machi Koro: you take ten different sets of cards and shuffle them all up, and then put them into the market one at a time until there are 8 different cards or stacks of cards. So at any time there are just two types of cards that aren't available, which seems arbitrary. I imagine this may be to keep someone from buying up an entire set of one kind of card right away, but it can also have the effect of that one important card not being available on your turn.

As a fan of deckbuilders, I'm eager to get more plays to see if this game lives up to my initial impression.

It's like Dominion on steroids. Mora tactic, less strategic and faster. For me it surpasses the original. I feel more involved in the game, and it plays more tactically with combos harder to pull of due to not being a fixed market from the beginning, which for me it's a plus.

More challenging and enjoyable with d4 dice instead of d6.

If you want longer match with more strategy and less lucky dice, use d3 (i.e.: use d6 with 1 OR 2 = 1; 3 or 4 = 2; 5 or 6 = 3)

Always use expansions to make thing more interesting and maybe more zenis to have greater teams and longer battles.

Remember to try out additional adventures proposed by fans, not only the original adventure book.

Suggested not only if you read the comics, but if you read them it  is much better.
Anyway it is a good skirmish with great fun.
Artwork and materials are absolutely great for the price.

Did not play a game as yet. Read the rules. Was not impressed to even start a game. 

Get all the characters to 1 place, face each other in a final dice rolling fight adding extra dice when needed. Till 1 side goes down. Can't imagine the fun in that. 

If they run around, it just lengthen the inevitable. 

Rating as a non player.

Very good tactical minis combat game that is one of the least expensive games in this style since the minis are nicely done cardboard stand-ups. Nice [u]unpainted[/u] metal minis are available but all of the characters are not out yet. I like this game much more than the similar Tannhauser. There are no fiddly counters or life tracks to keep track of. If you are injured you just flip the characters card and the new updated stats and abilities are all there. One more hit and you're dead. Simple. Okko is much cleaner and easier to play while still offering the player lots of choices. Uncomplicated and quick but still offers plenty of depth due to the nice interplay of several simple rules. Even though the combat abilities are fairly similar among the characters the game still works since doing well is often about position and forcing the opponents characters into less advantageous positions which can grant you all important bonuses. It fits the theme of hand to hand combat nicely. The rulebook is wonderful with lots of images taken from the comic that the game is intended to promote. All the rules are clearly explained and I found no rules ambiguity. The artwork on the map and pieces is also excellent and thematic. Unlike in Tannhauser, where the dark/foreboding color scheme was also used, it actually works in this game and doesn't detract from play.

I like the theme and the bits. The combat system is quick. There isn't much of a game here, but what there is works pretty darn well. Samurai and Oni (with a few Ninja and Geisha tossed into the mix) running around a nice-looking board, chopping each other up. What's not to like?

Interesting game!  The floor tiles look great, as do the standees (although they are a little too small for my taste, and sometimes make it difficult to determine facing).  Game play works well -- positioning is everything, so if you just rush headlong into battle you will have problems winning.  The terrain markings are ingenious, and using terrain in close quarters to an advantage can be difficult, but is key.  Found the game is a bit swingy because of the single d6 roll; I plan on trying it with 2d3 or 2d4 per player to put more importance on stats.  Holding dice in reserve is a clever design.

An excellent and light little game where players build teams of warriors and have at it.  The Inspiration Dice system, and the skills, as well as the double sided character cards (showing different skills and abilities and flipped to show a character is 'vigilant' or 'shaken') are wonderful and simple design elements that make this game a really fun little diversion.  Play is quick, there is a decent amount of luck involved - but good play is rewarded.

I like the fact that you can get miniatures if you so desire.

One thing I wish they had done was to put one copy (or even a sample copy) of the comic this game is based on into the box.  With such a rich and interesting visual design I am sure this would have resulted in many people being interested in following up and getting more.

For the price you get quite a lot in the box  for £21 although I have noticed some retailers are selling it for the higher price of £34.99 (probably down to economic climate). It is also a game that does what it says on the tin. Great if you want an under 1 hr battle. The theme is interesting and the artwork is of a high quality and the fact that it has almost had two expansions since release would suggest good support (even though the Yakuza expansion was just a little bonus filler). The game is relatively easy to learn although future expansions could add more depth/complexity. The magic expansion sounds like it will do this by adding event cards, magic, experience, ghosts characters and more maps/characters etc. If you want a quick game of hack slash and nothing more. It scratches that itch.

The only down side for me is no plastic miniature range to support the game. The metal ones are too expensive in my book and a bit outdated in the current market. I would have probably rated the game 1.25 higher if the game was supported with a good quality unpainted plastic minis line (similar to Tannhauser's unpainted range). The game will have 53 characters after the next expansion and paying in excess of £450 to substitute the card characters with lumps of unpainted metal is not good in my book. The designer and publisher needs to think about this as it's not good from a consumer/gamer angle and will also limit the appeal of the game.

RATING: 7
Very tactical board game that really gives it the feeling of watching a samurai movie. Placement, facing, terrain... all play a crucial role. You really feel like you're watching a samurai movie where every little movement means something in the final outcome, which is a swift clash of blades. I like the fact that a lot of decision making is baked into the mechanics of the game rather than with extra rules. However, my games have always boiled down to a bottle neck of fighting over a small portion of the game map, with units supporting each other so about 60% of the map is unused. I'll try more scenarios to see if the rating goes up.

(Edit: OK, not a bottleneck. A lot depends on terrain it's true, but the varied maps help a lot, as do the scenarios. I once had a scenario where the Demons were chasing a wounded Samurai all over the map while the Demon Hunters desperately ran around, trying to open the path for the Samurai to escape while fighting off the pursuing Demons.)

Overall: This game is one that I really do like because of how niche it is, but it has to be home-ruled to be anything worth serious competition. The combat has an interesting dice mechanic where you store dice to active character abilities, but rolling dice with only a +1 here or there is the entirety of the actual combat.

So far I've played only the introductory scenario, which doesn't really have any interesting plot points, it's just a straightforward 3 on 3 skirmish. This was useful to learn the mechanics, which are quite clever and elegant.  The movement and control zone mechanics make for some interesting tactical considerations.  I think once a scenario with a more interesting plot is used, this game will really come to life.

Update: Tried the next scenario, and the storyline aspect was more interesting, but the game dragged on a little long with 2 units left per side, and frequent stalemate or retreat-only combat results. The movement and control zone mechanics are elegant and interesting, but the combat mechanic is the weak spot, with not enough options to influence the random die results. I'll give this another try though.

RATING: 7
A light action fighting between demons and samurai warriors based on the French comic novel of OKKO. BTW this is also the name of the main samurai protagonist in most of the scenarios included. There is a variety of map-tiles to choose; the map is formed by 4 map-tiles on every game. Each player chooses a side of the board to enter game or persons are placed as stated in the scenario rules. The rules are simple and clear. Every player forms a team of warriors based on a point system. The team can also be equipped with various weapons, amulets and magic items. And then the fight begins. The winner must fulfill the victory conditions mentioned in the scenario. The fighting mechanics are simple. The higher the die rolls the better. A throw of one usually dooms your character no matter what kind of weapon he carries or how fearsome might he be. Fun interaction in the fantastic world of the Empire of Pajan.

a good-looking, fast playing combat game that is similar to Hybrid and Tannhauser, but ultimately boring as each game ends in a landslide defeat for one side as soon as you are outnumbered.

I like the comics though, good reading, dumb game

A skirmish miniatures game, but without the price and confusing rules.  Form a small party from either Oni or Demon Hunters and flesh them out with mercenary units or items, before setting them into play on a modular tile map.  Simple movement combined with devious strategy and cool abilities (that are used based on dice and corresponding symbols) make for an interesting game of tactical, chess-like moves.

RATING: 5
Good ideas: reserving rolled dice on a character to activate their ability, attacks primarily push characters around so damage is mostly done by shoving opponents into terrain, characters approaching an enemy are locked into a confrontation by their "control zone" unless they can escape, and cards representing characters are flipped when damaged to provide altered statistics. 

A lot of good ideas that I hope will be developed further in some hypothetical future game. Still not something I want to play more of. Kept standees, since they are nice looking.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (October 2010)

I enjoyed the game, but after playing Claustrophobia I don’t feel the need to play this again. I find the dice mechanic very similar in both games but the theme and game play of Claustrophobia is way better than Okko. It´s not a bad game and if the opportunity arises I’m sure I will play it again. The game is a very simple tactical one and I found it has a high amount of luck (Two opponents roll a die. The player rolling the lowest loses.) that can wreck havoc even if your forces were superior at the battle.

If we are talking about 2 player tactical games, Dungeon Twister and its expansions are still kings to me.

Okko has a resurgence in my game group as it was on sale on MM. A lot of us bought the game so I have played it a little more. It is a good tactics game, perhaps a bit light for my tastes but I can play it with some new players. I enjoyed it more now than in previous years so I´m upgrading its rating. I think it will go up in my ratings. For now I’m keen to play all the scenarios and I already bought the expansion.

2 plays only (with my son).

Pretty simple tactical combat game. Nice graphics, quick to play and fun - my son (who's 10) loved it. While it's not Squad Leader (and neither is it trying to be), it still has unit build costs, terrain, zones of control and ranged and melee combat (the former with LOS rules).

Looking past the simple core system, a good knowledge of the various characters' strengths and weaknesses is likly to prove the key to successful play (there are 20 of them with differing stats and special abilities), together with a knowledge of the equipment cards that give additional bonuses.

Modular board system (although unlike Heroscape it doesn't take 30 minutes to build a board), 10 scenarios in the box (plus you can design your own).

Love the immersive Oriental setting, the quality components (tile sections are some of the most gorgeous looking ever), concise rulebook and cool missions. The art is from the guy responsible for the Okko Graphic Novel so you can bet it's some of the best you will ever see in a boardgame.

We managed to track down the metal miniatures (available seperately from the boardgame) and they are top quality - got them pro-painted and we were ready for some Action.

Our first game had two Samurai and a bodyguard defending a temple at night from a massive Orange-haired Oni, a Geisha Assassin and her five ninja buddies. 

The Samurai guarded one doorway and the bodyguard the other and waited to spring a trap....only to have the Oni charge _through_ the wall!! This sudden Demonic Ambush resulted in an eviscerated Bodyguard. 

My GF went pale and said "The Oni can do that!?!" She was actually really freaking out lol 

Unfortunately for me she knew that the Samurai had to back each other up to win and they managed to fight their way out of the pagoda- killing the oni AND all the ninja with flashing katanas and flawless dice rolling. 

Tactically speaking Okko is very much the same as Go - both games have varying levels of complexity and strategy beneath the surface. Don't be fooled by Okko's simplicity...it's a Classic.

A very underrated game! I find the game has just the right level of tactics and luck for a boardgame. It's core mechanic is trying to line up your control zones correctly and making sure your enemies find themselves trapped. I really like experimenting with different team set ups, seeing wich combinations work well. And making your opponent go for a well laid trap, suddenly his top fighter has his back against the wall!

This game is similar to many other "miniature" type games, but it is very fast and provides a variety of characters to play.  The theme also helps.  I really like the board and when I find the figures cheap, I will probably have to pick those up instead of the standees.

Okay, this suffers from the same problem as Tannhauser, a lot of really great things pulled down by a really shitty combat system. If you roll a one in any combat, you are basically dead. Even if you have the superior numbers.  It just doesn't make any sense.  The look, and them of the game is top notch, and the inspiration dice are brilliant (like the waysystem in Tannhauser), but ultimately a great system for a combat game will ultimately be sunk by a crappy combat system.  I want to see if I can mess around with this using the dice from Mutant Chronicles and see if that helps this system.

This is the game that Tannhauser should have been from the getgo. No choosing combat packs for decades then choosing your team ie. 20 mins later you start (I already know what I want, the opposing team just seems to suffer from AP with so many choices).

This game has char cards with abilities already on them, no picking no hassle. Just compose a team and play. Plays quickly and captures the feel of a swordfight with attacking from behind, forcing others the retreat, shaken opponents. And finally a game again that includes "facing!" Make it all more worthwhile. Clear and simple rules (at least for me) and that for a french game!!!!

On top of that it has beautiful artwork, frankly I don't miss mini's at all tho ofc would have been a cool bonus.

This is an awesome looking game. even with just the cardboard minis.

Oni Waru, who i know has caused problems for others, is yet to die in any of the games i've played. i've been able to make him shaken but haven't been able to capitalize on this. indeed i have been able to kill every one of the demons and have it 4-1 vs Waru (but still not winning on zeni alone) and still lost. I don't think he is really too powerful but the amount of focus needed to kill him is huge. i really do like this game a lot.

RATING: 6.5
Great art.  Love the standees.  Due to the lack of miniatures,the box is compact, which I love. 

I like the idea that movement and position is important.  I did enjoy the action dice for powering up weapons/abilities.  Requires you to think tactically about your options. 

The combat will potentially make me walk away from this game.  There's not enough variation between stats so adding a d6 roll doesn't make for engaging or exciting combat.  If this was maybe tweaked so you had different dice to roll based on the type of weapon/attack you are doing (such as Imperial Assault/Descent), combat would be much more interesting.  I'm sure there are other ways to make the combat more interesting since anything is better than base stats modified by a d6 roll.

Also, combat can fall apart if it's just melee characters on the board.  You need the threat of ranged characters so you actually have to think about the risks you are taking by being out in the open.  

Definitely feel like this game could be approved upon and modernized.  Lots of good ideas, but the d6 combat kills it for me.  Maybe the expansions help the game?  No idea since I haven't looked into them much, but I believe they are hard to obtain now.

I had picked up this game before I really got into hobby/designer games.  The artistic production is gorgeous and I enjoy the theme.  It's a fun little game.  But since I discovered Summoner Wars, this game has yet to hit the table.

RATING: 7
Overview- the inspiration dice remind me a lot of SAGA and the combat system reminds me of Song of Blades and Heroes but it meshes these ideas very well and has some of the best level designs and the best rulebook I've ever seen in a boardgame. This is a keeper!

Wow the game is fast. At first I was concerned that the map was too large and that combat didn't seem to resolve anything but once a few characters became staggered things became more tense. The board layouts are also very well defined to allow outflanking but not make it too easy.

Honestly I'm very happy with how this played out and don't feel any great need to tinker with it. The downside is that the first battle is only a death match so I'm not sure how much story the scenarios can tell but I look forward to playing through more.

After a year I'm still pissed about this one. Perfectly fine light miniature combat system with unique flavor and gorgeous presentation ruined by moronic design issues. Like let's make a miniature game without miniatures. Let's make cardboard standups, but wouldn't it be a great idea to make them one sided, so there's no way to distinguish them from behind? Wait, while we are at it, let's make some of the characters so small, that the stand covers-up them to half of their heights. Oh, and then sell real miniatures made from solid gold, but only half as many characters as in the game. Mghrrr.

Fast paced 2-player skirmish game. Moving and positioning are key for winning, but a certain amount of randomness through dice-rolling can not be avoided. All in all a great game with numerous pre-set scenarios (though custom scenarios are also possible with the expansion "Era of the Karasu"), awesome artwork and theme as well as a unique play mechanic (inspiration dice). The expansion "Era of the Karasu" adds a whole lot to the base game, like additional characters, scenarios as well as a new game mechanic (summoning Kami). I enjoy it every time we play, but I strongly recommend adding "Era of the Karasu". Highly recommended!

It's chess/checkers with Ninjas!

The miniatures, I wish they would've been cast, but they're cardboard.  Yes, you can buy the minis cast, but would've been nice to have them from the start.  The cardboard minis are very well done though and the game boards make for some good mixing up of game play tactics.

Good quick (under an hour) strategic type game.

A very simple skirmish game with very nice artwork and MtG-sized cards. 

The retreat mechanism matches the theme nicely. Terrain cover bonuses are cumulative instead of fixed; I've never seen it done like this before. The inspiration dice system is a nice way of avoiding the most common problem of skirmish games, which is of course forgetting to use some of your special powers or combat modifiers. Since most character abilities are used only when you specifically activate them with the dice, forgetting is no longer a problem. Apart from these three issues, the game is like any other basic skirmish game.

There is quite a lot of text on the cards, so it would be wise to wait for the English edition.

A bit too light imo.  Great graphics, terrific testing, everything holds together and looks good.  Gameplay is awfully light though.  Sort of like Tannhauser only lighter...my guys move into a room, bust up your guys, somebody wins/loses, next room.  Not very tactical.

RATING: 5.5
Based on one play: Draft your characters and then enter the board, which is a collection of rooms and halls. Roll the dice to get power ups for your characters or increase their stats. You must kill off your opponent before he kills you. I am sure there is more to the game, but on a first play, it seems you just all run together and take hits. Would need to learn more of the strategy to possibly enjoy it more.

Simple game, with good ideas but not really fun. Special abilities are often very trivial and they don't really change much the results of combat, heavily dependent on the dice rolls: your character can live one minute and die on the first bad roll, or survive infinite (and boring) combat rounds. Only the great number of characters is able to give me a reason to play it more than one time, just to try something different.

Kipróbáltuk, sajnos, látványosabb mint amilyen jó.
Két játékalkalom után úgy tűnik, hogy egyszerű kockadobálós játék: aki nagyobbat dob, az nyer, egyelőre taktikai mélység (remélhetőleg, még) nem tárult fel.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
There is a fair amount of luck involved in the game, as the combat is decided by a modified 1d6 roll.  However, this is offset by the length of the games, which provides a fast and vicious skirmish.  This is in keeping with the theme which is quasi-Samurai; every combat is deadly.

The strategy in the game revolves around the terrain and the movement/retreat mechanics.  The dice rolling (apart from combat) usually only adds a minor bonus to the actual combat.  However, most combat results in somebody retreating, not in a lethal strike.

Tannhauser light tulajdonképpen a játék. A rendszer elég hasonló, de talán kevesebb kombinációs lehetősé van benne mint az említett játéknál. A kockadobás teljesen rendben van benne a csata közben. A kör elején dobandó speciális kockák, amiknek az eredménye adja meg, hogy milyen képességeket használsz majd a karaktereidnél, egész jól működő része a játéknak. Az első parti egy sima DM meccs volt, majd szeretnék kipróbálni egy feladatos szkenariót is.

I've not actually played a full game of this - but after doing a solo run-through, I got the bad feeling that it suffers from the primary flaw of melee-oriented miniatures games:  players move to the center, meet, and then slug it out.  Boring.  But this is likely an unfair criticism, as there are a number of innovative elements here.

I almost feel bad about not rating the game higher. The theme is deep and well-realized, and the presentation is gorgeous, even given the cardboard standups (metal figures can be purchased, but cost an arm and a leg).

My problem is that Okko just has too little depth to hold my interest.It's similar to Star Wars: Epic Duels in that regard. If that one satisfied your itch for tactical Star Wars encounters, and you're interested in a Japanese fantasy combat game, Okko would be a great choice. If Epic Duels left you wishing there was more game to go with the flavor, Okko will probably do the same.

This is my kind of game.  Variable character powers and a simple system of ready/shaken/out.  This game compares well with Duel of Ages or Heroscape, to name immediately similar ideas.  What I really thought when playing Okko is that this is what Cowboys Way of the Gun should have been.

Skirmish game with atmospheric artwork that is easy to learn, but offers plenty of opportunity for tactical maneuvering. It also play fast, allowing for multiple sessions/scenarios in a single evening. Still, the game is pretty random - nothing can save you if you have bad luck rolling the dice - you can only try to obtain as many modifiers as you can before rolling. The game's floor tiles (on which movement is measured, so there is no need for a ruler) are versatile enough for supporting a good number of scenarios. Also, the game comes with a good number of characters and even some item cards, so you can build your own team at the start of each scenario. All in all, Okko is a fun, affordable, en pretty complete skirmish game in a small box.

Don't let the low rating and complainers deter you, if you like the setting and tactical miniature games. Granted, without the big box expansion, this game is just a 6 for me. With Karasu it becomes a 7.5 or 8. 

There are lots of interesting decisions to make, mostly on where to place your guys to get bonus and avoid "instant" death do to not being able to retreat or hazards when retreating.

Love the boards and artwork. There is many combinations for setting up the game boards to allow for a new experience each time.

The manual and adventure book is top notch and actually enjoyable to read. A lot of work has gone into this alone.

The gameplay is so so. Move 4 spaces - attack, retreat get attacked, move - attack. It can all get a little boring fast.

Thankfully attacking or being attacked is quite enjoyable as there is some unpredictability and you never quite know which way the battle will go.

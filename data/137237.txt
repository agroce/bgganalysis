Bremerhaven is a strange combination of bidding, point to point movement and action selection. While the game is consistent, once you get through the fun but not-so-straightforward rules, the game is less fun than originally expected. The movement of goods is redundant and there are clear actions which must be taken in the early stages of the game. The play is way too long for what the game has to offer, the random factor is nor really helping. The game is playable but not much more than that. I will probably give it one more chance with two players because a 3 or 4- player game is way too long.

Complete nonsens. A bunch of mechanics that did not work well togehter. And generating prestige points via ships and some buildings is so miserable. Even worse is the playorder mechanism. Once you are on top, an event card could drop you down to the bottom. Boring and frustrating.
Two hours of gameplay wasted.

This game is way, way, way too long.  Several of the choices really aren't choices, e.g., if one person starts upgrading their cards, everyone else has to as well.  The game defines fiddly. There are some interesting concepts in this game, but as a whole it utterly fails. There is a good game in here somewhere, but I couldn't find it. Did I mention that is way too long for what it is?

As usual, I will open with the caveat that this was just one play (and there is always the possibility that we got some rule or another wrong).

Also, for clarification, the short game does away with the random events and (as I understand it, randomly) variable game length.  All of the spaces on your player board start uncovered and available (if you haven't read the rules, you use the spaces to hold goods that you have unloaded from ships but have not yet assigned to contracts).  Moreover, each player starts with a random building and a few goods.

That said, I had a number of issues with the 2-player short game I played.  

1. With every space uncovered, we always had plenty of room to store goods: There is no incentive to unload goods from ships until the ship is going to leave; each ship holds at most four goods (usually less); and you only need one free space to transport between a ship and a contract (one item at a time).  So any logistical challenges associated with transporting goods was not apparent. 

2. To scale the game, the number of ships and contracts each round is equal to the number of players.  In a two player game, this is too few options and makes it very hard to plan.  Since ships are your only way of getting resources to fill the contracts, you either need to only take contracts that match the ships you already have, or you take contracts and pray that the right ships come out in time (and that you win the blind bid for them).

3. The ships and contacts are seeded, so better stuff comes out at the end of the game.  This may be the most frustrating element for me, because it makes the early rounds feel like an utter waste of time.  You should spend the early game upgrading your cards and reinforcing your sea walls to prep for the big cards later.  Any points you score early will be dwarfed by the later results (this is how I lost; I tried to get out to an early lead, because I didn't realize that the later cards were inherently better).

4. You accumulate a ton of money, with very few ways to spend it.  I get that end-game money is one of the scoring factors, but I expected it to be harder to come by and harder to retain (a "you've got to spend money to make money" kind of thing).  Instead, I ended with $63 and 13 prestige (you multiply these for a final score).  My wife ended with $112 and 13 prestige (or something like that).  That's an absurd amount of money to just have sitting in front of you serving no purpose.

5.  The blind bidding was more annoying that I had anticipated, especially once we had a disparity in the quality of our cards.  I could lose items where I played two cards to her one, and there was no second place for some of them (if I missed out on the only boat that had people for a few rounds, I couldn't complete any people contracts, period).  It also wasn't particularly exciting with two players (once my wife had better cards than me, she could have easily just overbid me on every space I sought, preventing me from ever accomplishing anything).  

6. It's a game with a lot of small, fiddly components, which are just kind of tedious to move around.  (I know the publisher wanted to go with better pieces, but was unable to do so because of the cost.)  As a result, the decision-making to maintenance/bookkeeping ratio is pretty low, and if I ever played with four players we would need to engage in a lot of simultaneous play, which I generally disfavor in games.

7.  Based on the rules, I was hoping it would be a lot like [thing=39683][/thing] - you commit to having certain types of goods, or you commit to contracts requiring certain types of goods, and you try to get your production/contract opportunities to align.  The big difference, however, is that Loyang genuinely involves pre-committment: you generate the same resources for multiple turns and customers want the same thing over multiple turns.  Bremerhaven lacks that quality.  Ships bring in exactly one load of goods.  Contracts require exactly one load of goods.  And any miscellaneous surplus goods can just sit around your harbor for a couple of rounds at essentially no cost.  So it doesn't feel like a logistical problem so much as very simple pattern matching (this card give me a crate; that card requires a crate) effectuated by blind bidding. 

Again, I'm only one game in, but I don't see a lot for me here.  (On my scale, a 4 means that I could be convinced to play it again, but I would rather move on to something new).

I liked the actions in Bremerhaven, but I did not like the bidding at all.  This may have been because we played the short game.
It seemed like the values on the bidding cards we holding it back from being dynamic enough.  It felt like the captain was too powerful, and that the salary system  was unbalanced.
I may be totally wrong, but it would be worth another play.
Looks to have a lot of solo potential.

My oh my this game is tough. An economic pick up and deliver game of ruthless proportions. It has a blind bidding auction where you lose your bet if you are not successful so you can come out of a round with absolutely nothing. Aside from that element there are some neat ideas of collecting resources off ships and sending them off on lorries, particularly appealing are the timing issues the game creates as lorries wait for a certain amount of time and ships sit in doc for a certain amount of time, so you are trying to optimise the timing of delivery and pick up. And the artwork is absolutely gorgeous. It's a game that I really want to like but the way of acquiring the cards through the blind auction is too brutal and ruthless for it to create a balanced game, particularly when it is as long as it is. And there is little you can do to catch up a player with a lead and a set of better bidding cards than the others (you improve your bidding cards by bidding on better cards).

euro-style shipping game.  I like the secret bidding mechanisms.  This is a interesting but flawed game.  Game is basically divided into 3 parts.  

1st part is the secret bidding where you can see people bidding on cards but don't know the value of their bid.  This part can be quite competitive and fun.

2nd part is the reveal where you determine who wins each bid.  This is also fun and interactive.

3rd part however is managing your player board.  This can take a while and there is zero interaction on this part.  This definitely detracts from the overall game. 

Other issues:
Late game cards barely used and end game scoring needlessly mathy. Scores are usually between 1 and 2 thousand because you multiply currency by prestige (i.e. 132 * 17).

For me this is a horrible combination of blind bidding in which you pay your bid regardless and significant random events with a strategic economic game.  I don't mind blind bidding the right context (I'm a big fan of Bakschisch, for example.)  We really didn't like this game (3 out of 4 of us, at least.)  In fact, we stopped about halfway through.

Pro:
I like the general feel of the game. Managing the timing aspect of ships and contracts is really interesting and fits the theme very well.

Contra:
I don't like the bidding war for the worker upgrade and building permission spaces. The final scoring (prestige x money) makes for absurdly high scores (and high gaps in scoring between the players).

Conclusion:
I like it, but I probably won't buy it. A-K really liked it though.

Fantastic game!!

So you've seen shipping ports where cranes line up the wharf and containers stack up to the sky. But have you ever wondered what are the logistics of this operation?? 

This game is all about logistics of a shipping port. Ships come in with goods all the time. Will you unload containers and people in time?? Do you have room to store them?? Can you move them to the land transport in order to gain money from the signed contracts with the carriers??

You think it's easy managing a shipping port?? Try it!! Because you're in charge of a company that manages the whole thing. But other companies (players) want to get piece of the action. Not everyone will get the contracts they bid for!! And you can't receive all the ships until you develop your wharf. And it all takes money to do!!!

The head spins from all the possible options and timing in this game. Time determines the docking of the ships and waiting of the transport. Will you sell the goods to the transport companies at highest prices?? Or will someone beat you to it?? Will you be able to multiple your prestige with the money you'll make?? Try this game and you won't regret it!!!

Really indulgent theme portraying the shipping yard logistics that will have immersed up to your ears!!

What a letdown from Lookout Games. I bought Bremerhaven because I usually enjoy their games and I was deluded into thinking it had something to do with Le Havre, a game I really enjoy. Sadly, the only things both games have in common are the artist and (somewhat) the theme.

Bremerhaven has very easy rules and the playtime is around 3 hours with 4 players.

On paper the game sounded great, however it is long and fiddly with not enough meaningful decisions. It seems to me some actions are a must (upgrading your hand and the building space) while other aren’t that important. The first players seem to have an unfair advantage as other players need to spend a lot of resources to play first and win ties. I (kind of) liked the blind bidding systems but it isn’t enough for me. It doesn’t make thematic sense that when you fulfill a contract you still have to wait the time allotted to it :/.

The worst offender is the high luck factor. There is a lot of uncontrollable luck with the buildings (you don’t know which one will appear next so you can only react, not plan), with the events (they are very random, boring and players get punished for no reason) and, worst of all, with the market prices. It is hard to make money when you sell if you leave this to chance but often someone will manage the market prices, the problem is that all the interested players will throw most of their cards here but someone will win this battle (often in a tie so the turn order matters a lot here) leaving the other players with very few money when selling their goods. If only one player sells he can become a runaway leader. There is also luck when contracts and ships appear so this will favor a player only by chance not planning. 

The puzzle of managing your port is almost meaningless because it is so easy and obvious.

On the good side I enjoy that the ships and the contracts are time sensitive, here you have to really think your plan. I also enjoy the scoring system but money is way much more important than prestige.
 
The game components are ok, but many tokens are way too small, it is easy to knock them out of the board. The art is very good.

Bottom line, I dislike Bremerhaven. It has a lot of good ideas, but when combined they failed to make an exciting game. I will sell my copy ASAP. Bremerhaven is way too long for what it offers.

Played once, 4p, short version.  I enjoyed this game much more than my opponents.  I liked the time mechanism, where the higher scoring contracts will sit dormant longer, especially early.  The blind bidding could be risky, since most options were winner take all.  The only part I thought could use some work was the building mechanism.  Too often, the available building was useless, and just sat there as an unwanted option.

RATING: 6
FIRST IMPRESSION:

I actually enjoyed my first play as I explored this game.  There was obvious pain when my blind bidding lost out to my opponents as that meant loss of actions and future potential.  Game is fairly straightforward to play mechanic-wise.  The key to the game is organizing the timing of the boats and contracts well to go along with making sure the payouts are solid for the contracts.  Ideally, much like Colosseum, one wants to have three high value ships in harbor at the same time as well as a couple prestige buildings to have a high multiplier for your money/total score.  

SOLD - I wouldn't mind exploring this one more, but the time commitment and low level of interest here just doesn't merit maintaining this one in my collection.  Cost for production values doesn't jive well either - where are the wooden bits?  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
I never really paid attention to this one because it looked like Agricola and Le Havre, two games I'm not super crazy about. It turns out I may be good at pattern recognition.

It's been a while since I hated a game as much as I hated this one. I am amazed that the average eurogamer will put up with it. It's got the kind of interaction where the penalty is "ha ha you do NOTHING." You can easily get shut out of multiple actions per turn and if you are, you just don't do anything at all. Fun! Or you can concentrate your bids on the things you really want and still do poorly because it has those delicious Rosenbergian nano-turns where you use your action to complete 1/20th of what you need to do to get something worthwhile accomplished. Nothing like paying a ton of cash to get to do the building action so you can pay even more cash to build...a bollard. Because otherwise the other action you were allowed to take will be wasted. Also joyous is that when I finally got to actually fulfill a contract, the other players could also just jack around the prices simply to screw me out of literally one extra buck. Rename this game Bastardhaven and throw it in the damn sea.

Love the blind bidding and goods movement features of the game. Belongs in the Lookout family of games - smart, thematic and elegant.

Wow.  How could I have been so wrong.  From everything I read pre-essen, before the rules came out, this was my #1 game.  A complex economic simulation game.

Then the rules came out and it had blind bidding in it.
Then I played it and it got even worse.

My worst game of Essen 2013.  I very, very rarely get rid of any of my games, but this one, I did get rid of.

Where to start.  First of all, the game has so many flaws, it wasn't even worth the effort of trying to tweak it.  The blind bidding is nonsense and really doesn't work. The designer said it is fun - no its not.  I don't want blind bidding in a complex economic game.

The designer said "some spaces you can still use if you are second".  And yes, this is ok.  But that's 2 out of 13 spaces - not many at all.

You bid on contracts, you then have to bid on the ships that provide the goods.  If they don't come out, or you don't get them, you're screwed.   

The trucks don't move even when they have all their goods - they just sit there until their time runs out - this is a nonsense game mechanic which everyone hated.

When you sell goods, unless you went on the space to manipulate the price, its basically totally random how much you will get.  It could be something like 4 or 12.  So money coming into people was basically random.

The prestige point thing was an interesting idea but failed completely.  Since only final prestige matters, any gains you gain early game from ships is totally pointless.

The components are awful.  Fiddly little counter and stupid jigsaw shaped board pieces that just don't work.

I could go on.....

The lack of activity on BGG following this games release is justified.  This is not a complex economic game, its just a mash of nonsense game mechanics that might sound ok, but are not.

RATING: 4
Good enough game but I think we sabotaged it a bit by being too aggressive with bidding on spaces so players were unwilling to pay twenty odd coins for the runner up place. Maybe have the cost equal to the difference between your bid and the winning bid to make it less punishing? Also, the event cards felt like unnecessary meddling.

What this game really needed though was less fiddly small cardboard counters. Maybe green and brown cubes and black cylinders for the cargoes which seemed ridiculous as the cargoes were literally green and brown cubes and black cylinders. Similarly, the passengers could have been meeples and the bollards pawns. Strange when it came with a nice wooden card holder.

RATING: 6
There are some good ideas here and the mechanics match the theme very well here. However, it is a brutal game and the random events make the game even more brutal and random. There is probably nothing wrong with the game that could not be fixed with a revised set of rules because mechanically, the game works. Until then, there are better economic games than this.

Well, the blind bidding might dislike some gamers, but there is always the possibility to play with open bidding, both options are playable. Liked the time markers, there is no space or time to it all, so planing is essential. The Bank card was not used, and yes, depending on the timming of his acquisition it might represent some unbalance to the game.

I'm a bit surprised by the very low score of this game. If I read the comments, lots of people are turned off by the blind bidding (a concept I personally don't mind at all as it creates some tension while playing), which can't be a big deal: just agree to play your bidding cards openly.

I enjoyed my 1 play so far. It took us 2 hours+, but wasn't boring for a second. It's a real brainburner and in the beginning you have to get used to the special approach of this game with the time markers, especially with the contracts, that only give you a pay-out when the last time marker has been removed.

The worker (or face down card) placement mechanism is another thing to be angry about. All in all: disappointing.

We bought one on Thursday in Essen and played it with 2 players after the fair. Game mechanics are pretty simple:
- Random ships arrive carrying goods
- Random orders arrive requesting goods
- You own an improvable storehouse which can store goods to use them for current or future orders
- If you finish orders, you receive money according to the current price
- You have 5 bidding cards representing actions. You can do each action if you win with the highest bid or in some cased if you pay extra money. Bidding is face down.
- During turnplay you can do: Get a building card to construct later, construction [improve storehouse], edit pricing for goods, edit player order, improve your bidding cards, bid for a ship or for an order
- Game is turn based with a fixed ending. Victory points are calculated by multiplying reputation and money. Reputation is calculated every turn and is mainly influenced by the ships in your dock and your buildings.

Alternate rulings we will test in the next game:
- Construction option limited to one bidding card. If you are last player, you can easily make construction for others so expensive in important turns, that the effects are too strong.
- New orders and ships are decided by players out of the current gamestage beginning with highest reputation. This reduces randomness and gives reputation more impact in early game. 
- Face up bidding

In general, the game is nice to play - both for competitive and funbased players.

What a great logistics game! Some people find the blind bidding to be annoying, but not me. The fame mechanism and how it works as a multiplier in the end game scoring is brilliant!

After a few (regular length) games (all 2 player) we finally tried the short game.  Most games are short enough for me; I was hesitant, however the short game was excellent.  I may not play the regular game again.

This game just felt like a hidden auction/bidding game with some shipping stuff that happens afterwards.  At times, the game can feel like a tight strategy game but then a simple unfortunately timed event can wipe away several turns of planning in one fell swoop.  Something about the shipping theme still grabs me, however.

RATING: 8
A very dense logistical game of resource management and contract fulfillment. The blind bidding is set up perfectly to give you a balance between not-enough information and not-too-much information and the rest of the game is quite intriguing too. It's a little heavy for me personally, and I think a goods puzzle-movement system that was removed from the original design wasn't quite removed *enough*, but otherwise it feels like a new classic.

Le Havre grafikával megáldott játék, de semmi köze hozzá játékmechanizmusban, csak annyi, hogy ez is kikötőben játszódik. A játékosok saját dokkjaikba fogadnak hajókat és raknak meg teherautókat és vonatokat a megfelelő árukkal. A dokkokban épületeket is fel lehet húzni, illetve a kirakott árukat tárolni. A játék fő mechanizmusa a licitálás mindenre. Hajókra, szállító eszközökre, épületre, körsorrendre és erősebb licitkártyákra. Mindenki egy ötös csomaggal kezd, 1-től 5-ös erősségű kártyákból áll. Ezt lehet fejleszteni erősebb kártyákra, de mindig öt marad egy embernél. Ezekkel a kártyákkal kell licitálni, döntetlen esetén a körsorrend dönt. Egy helyre több kártya is tehető. Nagyon erősnek tűnt a licitkártyák minél hamarabb erősebbé tevése és a végén a győzelmi pontok megszerzése stratégia. A győzelmi pontok ugyanis úgy lesznek, hogy minden körben értékeljük a saját kikötőnket. Ezt a benne álló hajók és a benne levő épületek győzelmi pontjainak összege adja. Ez a szám minden körben csak nőhet, veszteni nem lehet belőle. A játék végén ezt a számot kell a megmaradt pénzünkkel megszorozni és ez a végeredmény. Emiatt elég durva eltérések is lehetnek a végső pontokban. Nekem ez a licitálós rész nem igazán jött be, a többi tetszett. Nem az én játékom a Bremerhaven.

RATING: 5
Nice game. Lots of micromanagment is necessary to achieve a great result, and usually is rewarded with a good result. But with even player strength, it becomes to a pure game of luck, cause despite a lot interaction in bidding, there is no strategizing and counterstrtegizing. You chose your startegy in the beginning, and if the luck of the draw supports it, you achieve better results.

But due to the fun part of managing the own harbor, playing the game is still fun. It's just impossible to analyze where the game went wrong/well for a certain player other then pure luck.

Fun to play, but meaningless if you win or loose.

This is a blind auction game of importing goods and shipping them out to fulfill contracts in order to make money and prestige.  These are multiplied together at game end for a final score.

I haven't played a lot of blind auction games and I like the mechanic, it offers some tension and outguessing/bluffing to an auction game that gives it a little bit more teeth.  However I think this falls a little short of achieving it's full potential because of some flaws with how it handles the mechanic.  Each player starts with 5 bidding cards valued 1-5 and a spot on the board (one of only 2 that multiple players can use) allows you to upgrade these.  The problem is that one player going after this space forces the hands of the other players to use it as well.  If you fall behind in bidding values you can find yourself mathematically removed from the game, unable to win any auctions.  The other big problem is that all spaces except for 2 are for specific actions that only one person can take.  No consolation prize whatsoever, this creates a huge differential between the winner and loser of specific spaces and can simultaneously hose one player and rocket another into the lead.

I also think the scoring is way too wonky.  You calculate your prestige at the end of each turn but it isn't cumulative, your prestige is always set to the highest total you achieve at the end of any single round.  This number is going to be multiplied by your money at game end for your final score.  I had two problems with this, first of all with how difficult it is to achieve prestige and how plentiful money can be, the game misrepresents itself by valuing prestige much higher than money when really the way to win this game is to ignore huge prestige gains and focus on money.  Even without trying your prestige is going to hit 10-15 by the last turn.  The other problem is there is no real way to gauge who is winning this game and the scores are never close so it can really diminish the effort players other than the winner put into this game.  When I finish a game 2 points behind the winner I actually feel like it was close and I played well.  The difference between first and second place in this game in my first play was around 200 points.  This doesn't feel close and kind of sours the experience.

I feel like this game has huge potential with the value cards and blind bidding system and even the port economy it has built on top of it and I really did want to like the game because I liked those parts.  But there are just too many cracks to try to fix or look past to enjoy that.

I liked the blind bidding aspect, but the good/bad news event every round is random and annoying. Players get rewarded or punished for no reason. There is so much else going on it hardly seems necessary. End scoring is so weird and causes such disparate scores, I'm not sure it accurately reflects how you actually played.

a shipping game with a time mechanic.  Each item either ships or filled contracts will not leave its spot unitl its time.  Which means you can easily fill your teminal with things that will not leave .... even if the ship has been emptied or contracts filled.  I would like to have had a way to speed things up to move the game along.

I am surprised by how little attention this game has gotten since being released. OK, it's a first time designer, but it's also a gamers game from Mayf... I mean Lookout.
This game combines blind area majority (if there is such a thing) with resource gathering and delivering for points. While the action phase is quite straight forward, the blind area majority part is a real brain twister. Depending on what value cards you hold, what actions/cards you want to get and what value cards the other players interested in those things are holding, you will have to be very careful about what card to place where when. Because you might not want to show interest in the spots you really need to increase your chances.
It reminds me a bit of [thing=25224][/thing], where the market is a real brain burner, the second part - the delivering of goods - is quite straight forward.
Our first game - with 4 - took about 3 hours. It didn't feel nearly that long, and most of us enjoyed it quite a bit. It was a bit of a brain burner, but as the rules are easy enough, but the choices meaningful, I feel this is a good game. I just wish it was faster.
I look forward to playing this again, hopefully in less time.

This one has been a struggle to work out. I'm still not very good at it, but it's a fascinating puzzle. The blind bidding is perfect; I don't think any game has done a better job implementing it. A few bits seem a little wonky (for instance, the empty simplicity of moving goods around your board looks like there was a mechanism there at some point that got the axe, but left behind this odd vestigial bit), but those things aren't a detriment to the game. A big euro that actually does different things!

With timers on both the inputs and outputs, this game resembles air traffic control.  The clock tokens are brilliant!  But the designer has unfortunately compromised to lighten an expert mechanism, and Bremerhaven will be enjoyable to few players.  For heavyweight gamers, the efficiency engine is a masterpiece--but blind-bidding feels like a children's game.  For middleweight gamers, the shipping is satisfying--but full trucks that won't leave are baffling and kill the excitement.

I'd seen this game around, but it looked so much like Le Havre that I mostly ignored it. Ron had said good things about it, so I was excited to try it.

You have a hand of cards which you use to bid on actions. There are a couple of types of actions. There's the win or lose actions where only one player can take them. The include getting the ships that provide goods, the transportation that let's you fulfill contracts, the turn order adjustment spot, the take a building blueprint spot, and the "change prices" spot. Other spots can be used by multiple people but the higest bid does the thing for free while everyone else must pay coins to make up the difference between their bid and the highest bid. These actions include the "upgrade your deck of building cards" action and the "Build stuff" action.

When you take ships or schedule transportation, those cards come with time markers and tie up your open slots for a number of rounds. The ships will often require you to have built more bollards (the poles boats will tie ropes around). There's also a way to open up more spaces for transportation and or warehouse space (which is fairly tight).

Buildings, ships, transportation and a few other things give stars (but only as long as they're in your port). At the end of the game your score is your highest star benchmark multiplied by your ending money.

One thing I didn't love about the game is that early winners at the "upgrade your deck of cards" have an advantage in bidding which they can then use to win the "upgrade" action. Ron used this to his advantage and had an unbeatable deck in the early game. Other players only caught up with him once he decided he was done with the card upgrading action and stopped competing for it.

I also didn't love that turn order is hard to change. The last place player really has to struggle to get good turn order, which puts him at either a money deficiency, or an action deficiency (if he's spending cards to adjust turn order).

Now that I have a better feel for the game I'd like to try it again, but I feel like the upgrade card spot can't be ignored and that much of the early game will revolve around trying to improve your deck.

This seems to be an underrated game. Very good solo experience. I like the clever clock mechanic which determines how long ships will stay in the harbor, or how many rounds you have to fulfill the contracts. I also like the theme and the art of the game. Plays very good with 2 players as well, bidding works well with 2 players. Will probably only play the short game, I expect the long game to become a bit too repetitive.

Economic passenger and freight shipping and shipyard management worker placement centered around the bluff, cat-and-mouse, and bidding strategy of the silent auction for action selection.

Manage a dock and bid on spots using 1-5 cards of ranging influence value. Depending on the spot, multiple people can get the benefit; the winner gets it for free.  Manage incoming goods through your docks and onto the awaiting transport to earn points or other rewards.

Pretty good game, can get tense; quite good chances to bluff with 2 cards on a spot with very low values.  Going first every round is also not an advantage.

I would play it again!  But not with the event cards; rather have it move the ship predictable 2 spaces every time.

RATING: 7.5
Rating just based on a couple of 2 player games, good straightforward game, that with 2, you can play in about 45 mins. Long game is better than the short.I guess that anyone with an aversion to blind bidding will have an issue with this game. I liked it more the second time as well, once you realise you  need to make as much money as possible. Usually you are accumulating to buy / spend , whereas in this you need to make as much as you can. I'm not sure whether I will rate it as highly with more players, must try it.

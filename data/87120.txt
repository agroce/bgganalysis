Played the final version on Thursday. A very nice game, easy to understand but hard to master. The different actions available make sense and there is big competition between players. Very nice modern graphics and high production value as well. A must have on the wish list.

I'm not sure about this one yet.  I played it twice with the advanced rules.  I'll have to try it again to see if it's more than just a decent game with a cool theme.  I also worry a little about replayability but that's not an issue right now.

+ Looks good (despite having huge cube/action color discrepancy), interesting theme.
- Unoriginal worker placement mechanic, with a bunch of random and overpowerful cards, and a way too simplistic mechanic of bringing the wine up and downriver. No creativity, no different paths to victory, no interaction, it's absolutely unremarkable. It's not a bad game for kids, but there's dozens of better games even for that segment.

Like the theme? Play Vinhos.

I have to admit this game seemed to make me feel kind of relaxed odd I know the game as a nice feel to it. Points do feel like you are a little limited to options and the game could maybe become a little repetitive once you find best actions to take however for me I did enjoy the theme and the feel to this.

Essen '11: Puerto Rico-ish production and shipping efficiency game, but without intrigue of role selection. In its place is incrementally costed worker placement. Not much story arc, just increased efficiency over time.

Really tight economic worker placement game. I'd like to get more plays in to see if different strategies are viable, like only 2 estates, etc. In our 1 play, felt sort of scripted, but it may have been our newb-ness.

I didn't like Vintage. My feelings were that the game is too linear (harvest, load the boat, travel to Vila Nova de Gaia, age wine in the wine cellar and start again with another harvest). It's also too luck dependient (Wine maturation depends half in a die roll and half in how good you have played) and, worst of all, the cards are too powerful, a good card can give you a lot of victory points which, with regular rules, you'll never get. So the first action for the first player must be everytime getting the best available card and force other players to take a card also in order to lock a 2nd card pick to the first player.

Other issue is that in the first half of the game you haven't got enough action discs to perform all what you want (good sign) but in the second half of the game you still have 1 or 2 actions discs and nothing worthy to do (bad sign). 

This game is way better than same designer's Caravelas but it feels like it was half backed, Vintage is almost a good game but it isn't and for me is sad to say this because [b]I love Portugal[/b].

Others say: nothing new, repetitive, biggest downside is it's extremely linear with Port production being the only viable way to get victory points, everyone must do the same thing like Salty Ocean but not as balanced with viable alternate point mechanisms.

Not a fun game. An immensely dull game, the graphics are dull. The end of the game seemed a little pointless. I know nothing of making port but in this game it takes your ages to do something before you get any points out of it. Most likely not playing this agin if you hadn't guessed. 1 Play.

Vintage is a fairly simple game. It features the familiar elements which should go in a wine game, of course: vineyards, grapes, harvesting, ageing, some influence of random factors (notably weather). Anyone familiar with Grand Cru or especially Vinhos should immediately recognise these mechanisms in Vintage. Vintage of course has its own twists. First, you need brandy to produce port. Brandy is made from the same grapes which yield the port, but of course you can't mix the production of both spirits. Second, the game features a simple transport mechanism: the grape juice needs to be moved to your cellars somewhere away from the production areas. Third, the game is held together by a a worker placement scheme with a nice little twist: with one exception, the later you take an action, the more action discs you place. And then it is just a matter of 7 or 8 rounds of producing brandy and port, and moving it about to your cellars, and attempting to score as many points as possible from the entire proceedings.

Vintage is not by any standard a difficult game, not even in the ‘normal’ mode which sees a bit more diverse use of action cards which are basically all good. And that is, I fear, also the game’s Achilles’ heel. Although a game turn flows along nicely, and the author has done a commendable job of translating the process of making port into a game, the actual [i]game[/i] seems to be a bit flat and uninteresting. Planting various grapes in your vineyard is not exactly an exciting procedure; producing the port features a nice ... how to call this... ‘ladder’ mechanism of sorts, but you can’t influence it much: it’s all quite processional. Only the bonus cards are cause for some deviations from the major patterns, but there isn’t a large amount of variety in them. Perhaps I’m being too harsh on a game I did genuinely enjoy my first play of, but I’m truly not sure how this appreciation will hold up over repeated plays. I've been known to be wrong in the past, but in Vintage I don't yet see what becomes the interesting diversion which has you coming back for more. That said, my partner liked this game sufficiently to have me purchase a copy, so we’ll see how things hold up. Still, I'm putting in a lower rating than I would like. Vinhos and Grand Cru are also not without their share of problems, but there at least I can see where the appeal lies.

By the way, dear publisher: [b]six[/b] full-colour rulebooks, in German, French, English, Spanish, Italian and Portugese? Isn’t that a bit of a waste of precious resources as well as my hard-earned cash?

[b]Update[/b] A rather nasty play experience which saw one player just walking away from the rest highlighted the fact that Vintage is in fact rather 'linear'. Everyone is locked in the same production cycle as there are no means other than port production to win points with. The player who gets this cycle up and running first is a strong contender for the win: the others simply have no means to interfere in some way, or to follow an alternative path. They have to produce, and have to produce [i]more[/i] and [i]better[/i] in order to catch up and take the lead. Everything which disturbs the cycle—who is first player, who gets a good random card, who rolls best with the die, who gets the good estates—has major influence, to the point where I think it becomes unfair and uninteresting. Means to reign in the leader, even in the more strategic 'challenging' variant, are very sparse, and appear at random. It's not unheard of to hear [i]I wish that card had turned up earlier, now it's of no use to me anymore[/i]. 

All in all it convinced me and my partner that continued experiments would just postpone the inevitable. With apologies to the author, who did his best on this game... But Vintage wasn't for us. So we just hastened things along and saw to it that our copy moved to a new home.

Strangely low rating on BGG for this one.  Seems a lot of people probably played Vinhos, and never thoroughly explored this one.
Vintage has one of the more interesting implementations of worker-placement I've seen.  The later you decide to pick an action, the more workers it costs you to do so.  The game is further compounded by the logistical concerns in getting grapes from the fields, back to your wine cellar, and by choosing which path to take with each collection - Ruby or Tawny.
I suspect those who only tried the game once think that some of the cards are too powerful, and indeed, some of them are quite powerful.  But since players are "drafting" from a row of cards, all this means is that vying for first player each turn has great importance, as does keeping a couple of workers available for taking and using a card.  There are a lot of options, here, and chief among them is the order in which you do things.

Nice "simulation" feeling, but unbalanced because of too small numbers: The extra value from 0 - 2, the die from 1 - 3 (for a die you roll only a couple of times during the game). These make it too luck-driven and too hard for players without their mistake. A single card worth 4 VP is much too high, too.

Nagyon jónak tűnik a borászat modellezése, és jól összerakottnak a játék. A kártyák nagyon fontosak, legalább annyira, mint h legyen elég brandy. A Brandy a szürethez kell, a kártyák meg sok plusz pontot, egyebet adnak. Szimpatikus volt.
Na kis update, van rá végre időm.
Szóval a portói készítést így kivülállónak jól tezsi össze. 
Fix 7 fordulós a játék, és van x akció (6 rémlik, de most nem keresem vissza) ezekből van ami fordulónként 1x hajtható végre játékosonként -pl a szüret. (Logikus borászatilag). És van ami többször is. A legtöbb akcióra igaz, h elsőként választva olcsóbb, mint 2., 3.ként választva. Kivéve a kártyahúzás-kijátszás: az mindig 1, illetve a hajózás: 1 lépés 1 egység.
Ugyanakkor fix mennyiségű akciópontunk -emberünk van  na meg a felügyelő, aki bmennyit helyettesít. És persze egy akciótípust nem lehet akármennyiszer kijátszani.
A pincében érlelésre letett hordók is jól elkülönítve a típusok szerint, sé persze ennek megfelelően más pont érték is. Igazából talán a ponthatár/pontérték nem oylan anyg különbség, az viszont az, h az egyes pontok megkapásához több hordó kell. Nagyon tetszik az érleléskor után kockadobás, h mennyit sikerült javítani rajta: 4 db 2-es 1 db 3-as és 1 db 1-es van a kockán: így jó modellezés, és még se csak vakszerencse.
A borászkártya nagyon hasznos: sok pontot hozhat: különösen, h a legfelső sorba, legtöbb pontot hozóba is tud tolni.
Minden kártyából van több-sok, szóval mindent meg lehet szerezni.
Ugyanakkor a brandy nagyon fontos, tudni kell dönteni, h brandy vagy bor vagy mindkettő, milyen arányban stb.
Szép és érdekes darab.

One play with two. Beautiful, well-themed game. I don't think it really works well with two, though, as there just wasn't enough pressure to the decisions; basically I felt like I could do anything I wanted, with only occasional interference from my opponent. There is also one action card that appears to be so powerful it's almost mandatory. 

That said, I did find it reasonably enjoyable. Would have to play it with more before I could rate it, though.

Wow, the rules are terrible. The gaming experience was extremly annoying. You read too much instead of actually playing the game. Often, you cannot use your actions because there is no option anymore.

I would agree with Maarten that a lot of randomness decides upon who will "master" this game.

I've wanted a game about wine production for awhile but I hadn't found the right one.  My wife likes to play games but not ones that are too heavy.  Vinhos looked interesting to me but ultimately I decided that she probably would dislike it, and with a theme like this I need to find one for both of us.

I decided on Vintage because it seemed interesting enough but also a bit simpler than the other wine games.  It appears to have space for strategy and optimization of your turn without having too invest all your available brain power for the day into it.  The "easy mode" rules also give it a big boost since I frequently have friends show up to play at my house that don't play "these types of strategy games" as the rulebook says.

After two plays I can't give it a great rating. It felt quite scripted and like there was only one thing to do. The only difference in strategy available was which estates to buy. The gameplay is quite subtle, and seems to be a game where you need to really watch the timing of your actions and optimize accordingly. 

2-player rules also leave a dry taste but it still looks really nice on the shelf!

UPDATE: Sold. Now we need a new picture to replace this with. Perhaps I'll get a print made of the box cover.

Very thematic (and it seems nicely researched) game about producing Port-wine. However the game suffers from rather limited interaction (you're only taking each other's places on the action table). 

If you like low-interaction games this might be just for you, I myself felt very lonely while playing.

Played an almost final version in February 2011 with Gil and Tiago at the company's headquarters.

A very nice game that blends well the theme with traditional mechanics of collect & deliver, resource management, and  worker placement for action selection.

While much simpler than Vinhos, still challenging, with plenty of options, and interactivity due to competition for cheap actions. The randomness of cards and of the harvest bonus in each round lead to ever changing games. 

Overall, a great gateway economic game with MESAboargames' usual good production values.

Vintage são dois jogos num só, pois apresenta duas faces de tabuleiro com complexidades distintas, embora partilhando grande parte dos restantes componentes. Numa viagem a todo o processo que envolve a produção do Vinho do Porto, 2 a 4 jogadores tentam produzir mais e melhor, de modo a conquistarem os preciosos pontos de vitória, aproveitando os anos em que a colheita é de maior qualidade para produzir em maior quantidade, e aqueles em que a colheita não é tão agradável para maiores investimentos. Já experimentaram?!

I love Portwine, so I just had to have this game.
It took me a while to get it on the table, but finally I managed it.
Although the system seems very linear (it's obvious what you have to do to get points), it is not as easy it it seems.
Obstucting your opponents can be done in a very subtle way.
Take the action they want to do, so they have to pay more for it.
It was a pleasant expirience.

It takes a few turns to get the rhythm and tempos down, but once understood, the game buzzes along quite nicely.  A tight economic engine where one needs to be efficient each turn.  Run out of brandy - and you lose a tempo relative to your opponents and fall behind.  No real catch-up mechanism - so watch out for errors.

Oh..most of BGG can skip the simple game and jump straight into the normal game.

I don't quite understand the negative feedback this game has received. To my gaming group, this game has been a great mixture of worker placement mechanics and logistics, with a touch of luck factor. The not-too-complicated rules make the game play fast, yet you get a good variety of options and have to plan your turns well and preferably few rounds beforehand. The theme, making of Port-wines, has been incorporated adequately, and the toned down artwork provides a good vintage-feeling.

This game has 2 of the best subjects in the world: Portugal and port wine. I like both of them very much and it helps the game in my opinion. Also, the game is designed by a friend. I usually prefer deeper games but this one, although with some faults, works pretty well and it's Gil dOrey best design só far in my opinion.

Worker placement Euro with a port producing theme. Players have to develop estates, which in turn produce wine and brandy, and these are then transported to cellars to be aged into port. There are a few mechanisms employed throughout the game from the main driver of worker placement, to card drafting and pick up and deliver. The game feels as though it is remaining faithful to the theme and all the actions you must take make sense. There are issues however regarding replayability as there seem to be a minimal number of strategies that can be employed. This is a solid game though and it has been wonderfully produced.

I think this is a good game, and while the die can be torturous, its swing is only ±1 (0: 50%; +1: 33%; -1: 17%).  Optimize your strategy accordingly.  There are nice, torturous mechanisms for worker placement, and a few interesting outs when you are otherwise hosed.  Unfortunately, it can [b]feel[/b] like the winner is determined by the die, but the reality is that it's a game that lets you think that there's only one way to approach it; however, there are strategies lurking under the surface….

This was an interesting abstract, but there wasn't enough there to hold me. Glad I got that out of the way before I spent one hundred bucks on the (still) gorgeous German edition. 

At the end of the day, I'd rather play [thing=3][/thing] or [thing=2655][/thing]. The luck of the draw is not mitigated as well as in Samurai, and for a pure information game, [thing=949][/thing] is still king.

Fans of connection games should enjoy this option.  The crossing of paths between the players can encounter extreme problems if a player is able to lock someone out of making a link.  While not very likely for more experienced players, it can happen and it will leave the game experience lacking.  Play the game quickly.  Keep it as a filler and don't fret about playing it perfectly and it can be a nice addition to your game collection.

Szép, igényes játék. A tábla két oldalára kell kijutni a fehér vonalakkal minél több helyen, a végződések számát külön összeszámoljuk a két oldalon, és a két szám szorzata az eredményünk. (Néhány végződés dupla pontot ér.) Ötletes, egy kicsit még agyalni is kell, de a szerencse szerepe elég nagy.

2 player goodness! This was one of my first hard to find, import games that I acquired and we have had a lot of fun playing it. There's a little AP issues, but that's a minor complaint.

This refers to the black, white and blue Kosmos edition, not that crappy black and red newer version. Uggghhh...

I'm extremely glad I was able to trade for this game at all.  My gaming audience around here tends towards less heavy games, and Ta Yu fits the bill as being attractive, not too heavy, but involving enough strategy to not be boring.  The tiles are wonderful and solid, the board is beautiful, and the gameplay is elegant, with a scoring mechanism that Knizia would probably like (the product of the number of connections you make on each side that's yours---east/west, or north/south).  A great-looking game that should really go back in print.  I think this will probably end up in my 10 category in a few more playings.

Conocí este juego a través de RTZ  y Paula. Se lo trajeron a casa para jugar despues de la cena y resultó bastante entretenido. Es un abstracto en el que uno debe conseguir conectar caminos para llegar al otro lado del tablero, con el objetivo de completar más caminos que el adversario.

One of my favorites.  Had I known about this game earlier I would have bought the Kosmos edition.  The Goliath edition includes a drawstring bag for the pieces but the box is needlessly huge, so I tossed it and keep the board in a felt sleeve I made.  Saves a lot of space on the shelf and is easily portable.

RATING: 10
This is a beautiful game, both aesthetically and in design.  The rules are short and simple, and the gameplay offers interesting decisions to make.  Once you start to become familiar with what types of tiles there are, it gets even more interesting.  Then you plan ahead more, to create potential openings for yourself or cut off space for your opponent, and you understand whether to pull a 2 or 3 sided tile if you have the choice.  During your opponent's turn, you can practice in your head by thinking about where you would lay the tile if it were your turn.  My only problem playing this is trying not to knock over the stack of tiles, so we build the stack inside the box lid for support.

Interesting and beautiful abstract game, especially in its 1st edition. There is enough depth to keep one interested for quite some time, although the hefty dose of luck it has is a turn off. In any case, Go killed all abstracts for me, so up for trade.

RATING: 6
Its a dry game (ironic, eh), but has beautiful components and intuitive play. There are several of these connection games where you're playing tiles to change the course of the network. Not sure there is anything here to make it particularly unique, although the shape of the tiles does add some subtle complexity. 

I've played it as a 2-player, but suspect it is at its best with 4p playing in partnerships. 

I'd be willing to play any time, but doubt I would request it and feel no need to own a copy. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Undistinguished connection game that reminds me of several other games such as Linie 1 and Metro mixed with Carc, but without the meeples. Like those titles the game is based on finding the best possible thing to do with a tile that you drew on that particular turn. Luck of the draw is largely going to dictate the late game, and although it doesn't really bother me in the sense of "oh, I hate not having that tile now", it does make the game pretty light with no real opportunity for looking ahead. 

The 2 player game seemed to at least feature some nasty hosage, but there was nothing here that was particularly special, or unique.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
An abstract.  I am incredibly hard to please when abstracts are concerned.  When I owned a copy of this, I was eternally glad I had not bought it but had rather won it as a door prize.  I played a few times, enjoyed it a bit, but in the end if felt flat and I traded it away.  For the fan of the abstract, I say "you go!", but for those of us who like a little color?  A bit of a yawn.  Absolutely wonderful production value though.

RATING: 7
Light abstract game. The luck of the draw limits planning; you may set yourself up for a scoring play that depends on a tile that never comes. However, the play is intriguing --- especially defensive placement --- even if you just take the game one tile at a time without thinking very far ahead. My only complaint is that many a tile drawn toward the end will help neither player, yet figuring out whether it will fit somewhere on the board may take some time.

Not bad - plays quickly and looks/feels good. Rules can be learned inside a minute.

Not quite the depth of strategy as 'Blokus' which it sort of resembles and I feel a little more 'done unto' than with other tile drawing/laying games - even Carcassone. A more textured board (felt/wood or something) might have been an idea as the peices slide about very easily on the board which if it gets knocked can be difficult to put the game back to the right position.

Aesthetically pleasing game play.  Basically a game for two players.  Not a brain burner.  Significant luck factor, so we have a house rule to play from two tiles rather than one.

RATING: 6
Beautiful game (Kosmos edition) that seems like a centuries old game from the Orient but is actually quite recent (1999).  Kind of like Dominoes, you draw a tile on your turn – each of which has three connections – and place it on the board such that it’s legally connected to at least one other tile. You’re trying to connect one end of the board to the other and your opponent is going across the other two sides. Your points are the product of the connections on each side, e.g., 2 on the North side and 4 on the South side means my score is 8 points. This means, obviously, that you’re playing both offense and defense with your tile placements.

I played one 4P team game, and I found this to be very interesting, especially with the rule of no talking/advising. Made for good fun in trying to anticipate what the other was thinking.  As I’m not a big fan of either tile placement or abstract strategy, I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked this one.

Surprisingly engaging for a tile-laying game.
Have only played 4-player partnership version.
I like this a lot more than Tsuro and even more than Carcasonne (even though there is more to Carc than there is to this game).
The scoring method is interesting and really impacts the playing of the game.
Played with the blue board/white tile set - really nice.

RATING: 7
I would rather play this game than Tsuro, or many of the other tile-laying path games I can think of at the moment.  The 3x1-space, rectangular tiles make this game more interesting and more varied than squares.  (I also like how the hexes play in Take it to the limit!) Bonus points in TaYu also increase the strategy.

As the board fills up, the game slows down more than I like.  However, a player can be in the lead throughout the game, but lose as the last few tiles are played.  A tile must be played when it can, so sometimes the only option benefits the opponent.  

One blocking strategy is about mid-game, when possible, to lay tiles on the opponent's border so that as many openings as possible are reduced to 2 empty places vertically & horizontally.  Another is to place tiles so that 4 or more tracks surround an empty 3 spot opening on his border since every tile has only 3 tracks and therefore there is no tile he could place.

A prime example of what an artistic Abstract Strategy game should be.  Tayu is easy to learn, involves complex strategies during gameplay, has an interesting twist (through it's scoring method) and is beautiful build/play and view.

Tayu happily surpassed my expectations.

RATING: 8
This is the game I had always hoped Metro/Iron Horse would be, but was not.  It's nothing deep or profound.  The random draws and the simple choices keep it on the easygoing, tactical level.  But the simplicity is part of the attraction, along with the spectacular thick clacking tiles and the beauty of the board and the totally false feeling that I'm playing some kind of ancient Chinese game.  It's a calm, soothing game.  But the fact that your opponent is always trying to stuff you keeps the game from being *too* calm and soothing.

The game's best by far with two players.  The partnership game is pointless because neither partner has any information or resources unavailble to the other.  It's exactly equivalent to playing any other two-player game with teams of players who alternate making the decisions.  You're not even allowed to talk to each other - how fun is that?  The three-player game sort of works, but definitely feels like a hacked two-player game.

A beautiful game that always grabs attention when played in public. Two players lay tiles that represent the flow of water. One player is connecting the East-West sides of the board, while the other connects North-South. Each turn a player can help themselves, hurt their opponent, or both. The game is very fluid and unpredictable, but easy to teach and grasp.

Another "path builder" along the lines of Tsuro or Indigo. Very attractive pieces. Gameplay is a little lackluster, it seems like since you only get tile per turn and have no "hand" that you can be ruined by a run of bad luck. Not a bad game but I can't say anything about it raises it above others of its kind for me.

RATING: 6
Played this once with 4 players.  We played with a variant where we each had 2 tiles in hand instead of just 1, which I think is good (and even more necessary than in Carcassonne), otherwise this game would be an exercise in futility ("why can't I ever get a tile that helps me instead of my opponent?").  But I'd rather play this as a 2-player game than a 4-player game where you're not allowed to suggest plays to your partner.

The multiplication scoring rule is interesting -- not too many games use that.

This a lovely tile-laying game which scores based on the multiple of connections made from side to side.

The tiles are attractively river-themed, and feel nice; the game itself is essentially a Twixt/Connections kind of game with a different scoring system.

There are certainly more options for defensive play here, and it makes an interesting version of the base side-to-side connection game.

This is a good puzzle game, is fairly quick, and excellent for 2 people.  It is abstract, but has a lot of luck with tile drawing.

RATING: 7
Game play is simple, consisting of drawing "stones", which shows pairs of lines on one, two, or three sides, and placing them legally on the board. The objective is to have as many lines exiting your sides of the board as possible. Stones with three exits are marked on their backs, so there is a small decision to be made most of the time when you draw. The game play is good, but nothing too special, and would rate a 6 on its own. High level of luck for an abstract. But the Kosmos edition is BEAUTIFUL and as I think the beauty of a game enhances it's play value, I'm bumping this to a 7. Thanks, Dave, for the Kosmos. What a present!

An abstract game for four people in pairs with road building feel. I enjoyed my single play, although I rarely enjoy abstracts. However, my opponent that play called it "checkers". But this was a reaction to a defeat, because the only common thing between these two is that they are abstracts.

Abstraktus žaidimas keturiems žmonėms poromis, kuriame yra kelių tiesimo elementas. Man patiko mano vienintelis kartas, nors aš ne per daug mėgstu abstrakčius žaidimus. Kita vertus mano to karto varžovas pavadino šitą žaidimą "šaškėmis". Bet čia buvo reakcija pralošus, nes šie du žaidimai tiek ir teturi bendro, kad abu abstraktūs.

RATING: 7
Simple game that runs in 15 to 30 minutes. Replayable if the players match in skills (logical). Can become boring if 1 is alot better than the other. Also picking the tile can be very random. Might be solved by using diffirent rules explained in the rulebook. Tiles with a river exit on 3 sides are marked compared to tiles that have the river exit on 1 or 2 sides of the tile.

Fantastic game!  So easy to pull out, but such fantastic open-ended decisions to make!  We always play more than one game in a row; my wife and I have played about 100 games so far, and it is still always fresh, fun, and fascinating!

(I have played the original 19x19 version, and then bought and played the red 18x18 version, and the difference is not a big deal.  The red is fine, the curvy lines are pretty, and the board has depressions to help the tiles stay in place.  Buy and enjoy the red version if it's easier to find!)

Nicely produced tile laying game. Can get brutal and cutthroat if you let it, and the choices you make early have a dramatic effect on the game.

Excellent game in which you seek to end your rivers on either your own side or the opposite side in a 2 or 4 person game.  Play is simple as you must play a tile so that it connects to another river and doesn't flow into a blank tile.  Ideally, you seek to expand your opportunities to make connections to either of your sides while blocking your opponent(s).  Your score is the PRODUCT of the number of estuaries (river endings) of the two sides of your board.  Three player game is very different as you all bid on a number and whoever is the last one standing seeks to prevent the other two from scoring the number of points bid.

A good abstract strategy game that has beautiful components to boot. This one was one of the first games I purchased when I was getting back into gaming in my adult life, and I enjoyed the hell out of it at the time. Over time my gaming tastes changed and I didn't really enjoy this much abstraction in games (I am an AT gamer afterall), and so it was traded away, but I enjoyed the time we had together Ta Yu and I.

An OK abstract tile-layer for 2 players; the 4-player variant just makes everyone angry that their partner didn't make the "right" move on their turn. Artfully executed, easy to learn the rules, but basic tactics are a bit harder to grasp. Unique in the shape of the tiles; the 3x1 proportions make for some unexpected moves. Not a pure abstract since luck of the draw is a factor. In this regard it's similar to Carcassonne. Good for teaching younger players their multiplication (scoring is based on multiplying the number of endpoints at each of your two ends).

A simple tile placement game where you connect lines and try to get the lines to touch the side of the board.  You multiple the lines on one side with the lines on the other.  You are trying to cut off your opponent while at the same time getting as many lines to touch.  The game is probably deeper than it looks on the surface.  But this is boring little game, but an ok filler. 

AP prone players should not play this or it will take forever to play.

Nice abstract, great production value. For me the hardest thing to decide is whether to help yourself or hamper your opponent. Too much hampering your opponent: you get less connections, too much helping yourself: the opponent hampers you and you'll get too few connections...

The game takes not too long and there is not much choice to put your tiles, so AP doesn't play a significant role. It's great for training in turning the tiles in your head.

Edit: not really an abstract for me. I play too much hampering my opponent, but that doesn't give me points and actually will help my opponent further in the end. I like it, but not an abstract game meant for me.

German Kosmos edition in near mint condition. English printout of rules included. Beautiful, heavy cream tiles with blue rivers which are pleasing to the eye while filling the 19x19 gameboard, and follow the Chinese tale "of the hero channeling the flood using rivers to divert the water to the sea". The Kosmos edition is far superior to the blood red Goliath edition which has a smaller 18x18 board and is actually painful to look at over any period of time.

Ta Yu is a case of draw-a-tile, figure out the best play; and doesn't really reward forward planning.  If I'm playig an abstract, I like to feel that my decisions are more significant than they are here.  Beautiful plumage, though!

Great tile-laying game, intuitive yet deep. Works with two and is pretty fun with four, too. I haven't tried the three-player game - I've never had three players familiar enough with the game together so we could try it...

There's really nothing bad to say about it. It's not a deep strategy, but does very well what it sets out to do. My edition is made completely from plastic, which thanks to pieces and board engraving makes it easy for the pieces to stay put (unlike Ingenious) and it's even possible to play in a whirlpool (tested). There's not many boardgames that could survive that unharmed. :)

One of my favorite two-player games. I like the scoring system that forces you to deal with both sides of the board (you multiply the number of connections you make on one side by the number you make on the other). I do wish the board matched the quality of the tiles, though.

overrated abstract connecting game, where you draw and place rectangular tiles - with blue lines representing canals and connecting two or three sides of a tile - in a way to enable you to connect to the opposite side of a square shaped board and prevent your opponent from doing the same.

RATING: 8
While it lacks the complexity of for instance Pünct (let alone Twixt), Ta Yü is a very interesting variation on the connection game -it's not just about joining two sides, but about how often and in which distribution it's done. There's a clear random element in it, but as the game goes on it becomes easier to keep control over it. Unless there's a huge difference between players the right tile can cause a lot of harm, so the playing can get quite mean from mid-game on (in the end every hole in the board is welcome!).

It's a really easy game to teach, the idea is crisp, the pieces have got two or three sides united in all combinations (nice and symmetric) and the materials just add on to the pleasant experience.

Preliminary rating based on 1 play.  The game's gorgeous and totally worth the price now that it's available for 20 Euros overseas.  Yes, it's heavy, but it's worth shelling out for.  It's a totally unique game - one in which the traditional 'I go towards you, you go towards me' mantra of the abstract game has been twisted 90 degrees - here, one player goes N-S, the other E-W.  Fun and not too tense, this is an abstract that will likely see much more play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's just another criss-cross tile layer, trying to join your sides with as many connections as possible (score = connections on one side times connections to the other side). The strategy seems to be to play defensively at all possible times, shutting down your opponents lines (focussing particularly on one side to reduce the multiplier), and if that's in control, open it up for yourself when your pulled tile allows you to do so. It's play 1 draw 1, so your turns are usually pretty easy to play and you either get lucky at the right times to open it up (for you) or close it down (for opponent) as the chances develop... or not. It's ok as a 30 minute time passer.

I like tile connecting games with borders as placement choices become more limited so (hopefully) increasing game pace. The beauty of TaYu is the clear and simple objective of connecting your opposing sides as many times as possible. Your score is one side times the other,and here lies my first problem: as connections become numerous, my short term memory of adding twice evaporates before I can multiply. So scoring status assessment has to be worked at, rather than visual, so for me the competitive tension is sometimes not there. (Another quibble is that set up is time consuming, compared to Carcassonne and Metro. Also had to introduce the rule of drawing at turn end, so as to have something to consider and increase placement tension). Not only does the scoring make game play dramatic but also the tile size and design can dramatically change the player intent, so has elements of sit-com, so fun for the mentally ticklish. Tile types are numerous, so unless familiar with them, you feel deprived of skilful probability assessment when deciding placement. I enjoy the game.

Jogo da velha escola, sem visual apelativo e cujas variantes apenas disfarçam ser apenas mais um dos destinados a confrontos cabeça a cabeça. A caixa é bonita e o saco é vistoso, contudo, o tabuleiro e os tiles não contagiam muito e pouco abonam a favor de um jogo que até acaba por ser interessante. Recomendo apenas a quem goste muito do género - a mim não me incomoda, mas a maior parte dos jogadores que conheço não lhe dariam sequer uma oportunidade...

okay for an abstract.  They aren't my favorite.   This has elements of area control but I can't get over the fact that the luck of the draw towards the end plays a large factor.

Pleasing pieces and simple rules, but it left me unsatisfied.  There was far too much luck -- as you get close to a wall (one piece-size away), there is a huge swing based on what the next 2 pieces drawn (by your opponent and then you) are.

Perhaps the next tile in the stack should be visible, so that you can plan around your opponent's next tile.  At least then, you would less often accidentally set up your opponent for a good play.

Addictive tile placement track-building game.  Played a lot years ago in Austin with first white-tile edition.  At Essen 2007 played with new edition with cheaper-feeling plastic red tiles and new plastic board with different layout of the bonus exit points.  Doesn't look as nice to me, but they improved it by having you draw from a sack, since the original rules were annoyingly unworkable with pulling tiles from a prebuilt block, since you could see the edges of the tiles and know what you were pulling.

This is a lovely game that while beautiful and elegant is just too frustrating for my tastes out of the box.  I like the game-play, but there are just too many times where you are absolutely constrained by your tile draw.  As the game draws nearer to its close, you get to the point where you are trying to ditch tiles into dead zones waiting for a useful tile to be drawn. I don't really find a game exciting when you are spending a large portion of it exerting effort to find the least useful spot for your piece.  The game just ends up grinding as people try to find any spot to place useless pieces.

I'm sorry, but that is retarded.

I'll only play this again with two tiles in hand.  I suspect that my rating would increase dramatically.

I really dug this as a two-player abstract tile-laying game.  First of all the components (outside the thin box insert) are top-notch, like quality dominoes.  The game itself is really easy to learn/teach, and, while one could burn their brain over-analyzing the board, it's really a light game.

A relaxing game that pleases the visual and tactile senses.  Nearly zero tension, due to the "draw a tile and see where you can place it" aspect that discourages planning ahead.

Our players have enjoyed the partnership game very much by following the strict prohibition in the rules against giving any advice to your partner while it is his play.  (If partners were allowed to advise each other, that interesting dynamic of partners working at inadvertent crosspurposes would never arise.)  Anyway....  The shape of the tile, a rectangle covering three spaces on the board, raises Ta Yü from the level of Streetcar, not a bad game, up to something more interesting, something that feels rather like a classic.  The opulence of the materials and the deep blue color scheme give the game a nice, classy feel as well.  A solid wooden board and a box with recessed storage spaces for the tiles  would make nice upgrades, but I suppose this is but the stuff of daydreams.  P.S. The solitaire available in the files section is well worth playing.

In the first half of the game it seems as if your tile placements do not exert much influence as so much can happen afterwards. The game play feels a bit boring in this stage.
In the second half things get more exciting and tense. However, now players are very dependent on the draw (you draw only one tile per turn). If either fits your open ends or it doesn't. Very luck-dependent and not at all tactical.

Surprisingly good considering how much I disliked Metro.  It looks like it would be as unpleasant as Metro, but the simple fact that there weren't countless intertwining paths to trace made all the difference in the world.  Instead there was simply one path to trace around the board.  The components were excellent, the rules simple, the gamplay fast, but the strategy very interesting.  I played both 2-player and 3-player games, and thought it worked well with both, but was particularly intriguing as a 3-player game because one player played as the "flood" trying to block both of the others, which is very unique and clever.

This game is easy to teach, but quite hard to master. I normally play the profi-version (two tiles open in front of eacht player), which strikes a nice balance between luck and thought. Although the game is quite relaxing to play (draw a tile, then place one), you do need to concentrate to make the best move. If I am honest, though, I would probably lower the score by one point if the tiles were more ordinary (like in the Goliath version). As it is, they are BEAUTIFUL.  Still, if I am in the mood to play something like this, it would be easier for me to bring Indigo to the table instead, as that game plays a lot faster.

I'm glad I got this game.  It is a pretty simple game, but it has a nice amount of give and take.  There is some screwage, but it generally didn't feel like your last option was closed (at least until near the end).  It works very well for two players.

I thought I was getting my but kicked for the first half of the game, but I was still enjoying myself.  It helps that I find scanning a board for connections to be a fun and relaxing pastime.

I need to make a form to hold the arranged starting tiles.  That would cut down on the setup time.

Good 2 or 4 player game. Production values are just excellent and also game is very good. I just don't know how to play game well.

With advanced rules plays best, by far. We also tried a '2 stone' variant, where you could always choose between 2 stones, but in fact it increased the luck-factor.
2p-games only, nice filler.

This looks like a really interesting, elegant little game, and would certainly be worth a place on my game shelf if the box is small enough, and the version I get has nice enough pieces.

(July 2014) - This was on my radar to try and as the rules were explained and the game play evolved I knew why.  I like tile placement, I like some abstracts, I like quick games - this has all of that.   

The balance needed for final scoring is cool too.  The "doubler" scoring spots on each side are useful for strategy - both offense and defense.

Очень понравилась такая неторопливая игра. И если бы не рандом, то оценил выше.
Попробовать выбирать из трех "доминошек", оставляя две открытыми и добавляя по одной?

Идейно интересен вариант игры для трех игроков. Пока не пробовали.

I love tile laying games!  This is a great one.  Lots of opportunities to mess up your opponents plans, while advancing your own.  For a very abstract game, the theme adds ambiance and works well conceptually.  The tiles are a lovely thick bakelit, and have a satisfying heft.  Game play is quick, easy to teach and overall make a very fun game.

Abstract game. 2 persons or teams play against each other. They try to connect their 2 sides as much as possible. You have to connect by them by putting stones on the board on wich you see a river with 2 or 3 exits. 

Not bad to play but I woudn't buy it.

There's certainly a strategy involved here, and that involves either helping yourself or hosing your opponent.  Either way, a lot of the endgame depends on the luck of the draw, and the games tend to be very repetitious.

Fluid, intuitive, and satisfying.  Where were we before Ta Yu?  I've never seen a game with so few rules, so easily explained, so internally perfect, with such wide appeal, and so addictive.  The choices for most pieces are difficult, and until the end game there is a tension between advancing yourself and blocking your opponent.  Even the micro-arbitrariness of each individual piece doesn't change my opinion, especially not with the variant where you keep one in hand.  I've only tried the three player variant once, but it's an ingenious idea and I have great faith in it.

Nice abstract.  Looks very good after a game is finished; this is one to play and leave out for a while.

In Ta Yü, a sumptuously produced game of connections, one side tries to extend from the starting tile in the center to reach the western and eastern edges of the board while the opposing side tries to reach the northern and southern edges. On your turn you simply draw a tile and decide where to place it, extending the network of tiles already on the board.
\13\\13\
Several refinements make this simple proposition into an engrossing game. First, each tile is 3x1 (to be played on a 19x19 board) and has exactly three outlets (potential connection points). Second, your score is not simply the number of spots you've reached on one edge added to the number of spots you've reached on the other, but is the product of those two numbers. So you can't just concentrate on one side and ignore the other, because zero times anything is still zero. Third, on each side of the board there are three special points which score double if reached, adding a dab of focus to the choices.
\13\\13\
Interestingly, you need to play both offense and defense and will often have to decide to which use to put a particular tile.

An interesting little abstract puzzle game.  The limited communication allowed makes the team play slightly more challenging (and if your partner is a terrible player, I would imagine frustrating, too).

Played a few times (with 2 and 4 players). An interesting tile-laying and connection game. The superb components and the simple rules probably make it a good initiation game, but it probably requires several plays to play well. The randomness is reduced by the different tile backs, but it is still present and can definitely affect the result of the game.

Too random, and most of your time is spent finding a spot where you can actually play the tile. Prefer Tsuro of this by a mile.

This is a much more easygoing 2-player game than one of the GIPF games.  Good for when you want a 2-player abstract, but don't want to have to work too hard at it.

The play time is much shorter than the billed 45 minutes. Play like Carcassonne, drawing your next tile while your opponent takes their turn; ~25 minutes.

This abstract tile connection game looks and feels gorgeous. The game play is simple and fits the theme. I wish the board were of better quality to match the lavish pieces. Don't believe whoever wrote the game summary because this game is fun with 2, 3 or 4 players.

Takes a little bit long to set up: stacking all the tiles can be a bit of a pain.  It is fun and my wife likes it.

Had no idea Ta Yu was based on an ancient Chinese folklore when I first got my hands on a copy, definitely made it easier for me to introduce and explain the game to my family.  The pieces were really well made, which unfortunately caused the board to look quite drab by comparison.

As for the gameplay, well, it's probably one of my favorite abstract strategy titles.  I like the unique scoring.  It forces you to concentrate on developing both sides equally, and having a partner really helps with that aspect.  It is also important to keep the waterway flowing, so one at times has to decide between scoring and blocking yourself from future development, or to wait for better tiles that will allow you to extend the river.  It's an awful waste to leave a big section barren and unreachable.

Two things I didn't care for.  First was the analysis paralysis, but that has more to do with the type of people you play with.  It is particularly frustrating when someone is more interested in "solving the puzzle" by the need to make every pieces fit, even if it does not help him/her to prolong the game.  Maybe we'll have to use a timer in the future.  Second was the tile drawing.  Sometimes you just have bad luck and can never get the pieces you need.  This is somewhat mitigated by being able to tell which ones feature exits on three different sides.  I guess it isn't really fair for me to complain about a design necessity, since I cannot offer up a better solution.

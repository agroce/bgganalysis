It is a card game that reminds me of Dungeon Lords because of the theme, it is surely very different and less complex, but in the end the heroes you face are very difficult to take care, very rare to get a perfect scoring of defeating them all. It is a fun game, with a good bid system and a little bit of memory game. Good for playing with 4 or 5 people.

Not really my style of game, in general, but the designer showed off the game, and I definitely had a great time with it.  It's quick, easy, but definitely requires using some thought to play effectively, which is the most important thing to me.  Definitely one I'd consider getting.

A nice quick game that has fun drafting and selection mechanics.  Portable and light, the game works best if players dive into the theme of beating back heroes from their castle.

10/16: Cute, but ultimately unsatisfying. The HTI is annoying in this game, as it's necessary to prevent a long puzzle-solving sequence that would need to be backed up all the way to the post-draft auction phase. Anytime HTI prevents a game from being broken, it has a very short time on my shelf.

Wow do I hate the memory aspect of this game. Somehow, I still enjoy it. Rule was officially changed, less of a memory game now.

RATING: 7
Initial Impressions:
--------------------------
Wow, found this one to be very fun.  For Sale, but with much tougher choices as you have to build a tableau that can survive the heroes you draft.  The other part of having to face the heroes in the opposite order that you spend them makes for some really crunchy choices for such a short game.  Really neat filler, and while I am not sure it replaces For Sale, since this is less of an auction game, and more tableau building, I do think I would rather play this one at this point.  We'll see how well it holds up after more plays.

This is a card game inspired by [thing=172]For Sale[/thing] where you're a simple evil overlord running his own dungeon who has to fend off these heroes who come to plunder it. Like FS, there's a drafting phase (for heroes) and then an acquisition phase (for defenses). But then there's something else that FS doesn't have -- you have to fend off the heroes you chose with the defenses you acquired. 

You draft hero cards (total of 8 hero cards) via a traditional card passing draft. These heroes have numbers on them with higher the better (similar to the houses in For Sale) that you use in the next phase of the game. 

In the next phase, you use your hero numbers to draft defenses. You want more than just highest powered defenses, though, as the heroes you drafted have vulnerabilities and strengths. You want to match up your defenses to the weak spots of the heroes you chose. Hopefully you drafted a lot of similar heroes.

Then you have to use those defenses to defeat the heroes you have by turning over your stack of hero cards one at a time and applying whatever defense(s) you need to kill them. Soon as you can't kill them -- usually b/c you've run out of cards -- you're dead.

So the fun here is that getting higher hero cards that give you first choice in drafting defenses also means you'll have more difficult heroes to defeat. It would be like drafting the best house in For Sale then getting the best check but then having to use that check to fight the house you used to get it.

Fantasy themed auction bidding game with some twists. Contains a double bidding auction system, like for sale. But takes it one set future because the order of which you "bid" with the heroes determines the order they come up.

First you drafting heroes that will enter your lair. Then you draft defensively traps to defeat the heroes while simultaneously seeding the order the heroes enter your dungeon. Stronger heroes give you better pick order when it comes to traps

Then you execute and see how your defenses hold up against the heroes (hint, they won't)

Juego ambientado en un dungeon. Representamos al dueño de la mazmorra y debemos protegernos de los héroes que vienen a atacarnos haciendo uso de unas trampas. Recuerda un poco al puzzle del final del Dungeon Lords.

Primero haremos un draft con las cartas que representan a los héroes. Con los que nos quedemos nos subastaremos las trampas, marcando esta subasta además el orden en el que nos atacarán los héroes. Una vez tenemos la trampas iremos combatiendo uno a uno a cada uno de los héroes que nos ataquen. Si sobrevivimos ganamos la partida

Es un juego más bien ligero (sin llegar a ser un filler). Es divertido ver cómo la gente afronta sus héroes.

I have now played a number of games today as initiation into this little gem.  It's surprisingly deep for a quick game.  Short, sweet and vicious with 1 round of deck building, then another round of deckbuilding based on the deck built in the first round... and a final round to see if you built the correct decks.  Nice.

Dark Dealings is a card game that's played in three phases.  First, players draft the heroes that they'll have to fend off from their dungeon.  Second, players will use the value of their simulaneously-revealed heroes as the order in which they draft a lot of trap cards, while placing the heroes in a pile face-down in the order they used them.  Third, players will reveal the heroes in order from the face-down pile, and attempt to use the traps to defeat them.  If no one defeats all eight heroes they drafted, the player who defeats the most heroes is the winner.  I enjoyed this as a filler that has a bit of a For Sale feel to it.  As a survival game though, I'm a little concerned that making sure your heroes come out in ascending order of difficulty is too good of a strategy.

Just wanna try how it goes. ;D

Edit: Once played it a few games I realized how really bad i am playing this game  (memory skills need to be trained) but even though I enjoyed the game and the mechanics.

The game is easier to learn than it seems in a first look, and it is paced really fast.

Feb. 2015: Played a prototype at PrezCon and really enjoyed it.  Drafting cards to be your heroes is quick and fun.  Then you have a chance to help decide what type of bad dudes you'll be facing.  Lastly, go through your deck trying to whip the bad dudes.  Last player with heroes left is the winner.  30-minute max.  Fun to watch your buddies go down in flames.....  Ages at table were 12-55 and everyone was having fun and laughing.

June 2015: Kickstarter announced.  I'll be backing it.

This game looks simple and light but it is anything but. It's hard, but in a good, brain burning way. It has a neat combination of drafting and auction mechanics, both things I really enjoy.  The art and component quality are second to none.  I'm not sure this game would be great for inexperienced gamers as the auction and bidding and the amount of strategy and tactics that go into doing them successfully are quite challenging.  However, if you like a challenge and understand that you don't have to defeat all the heroes, just more than your opponents, this is a great game.

Fantasy based Evil Overlords in a last-tower standing match to outlast the others from those pesky relentless heroes.  This game has a lot of unique twists and game play elements that I really enjoy. In no particular order; I love the concept of drafting tower defense cards based on the power rating of the very pesky heroes from your deck that you will be later defending against. Blows my mind with possibilities. The special powers of the heroes create some interesting puzzle challenges. I love multi-face cards to add additional powers or benefits before being consumed simply by rotating the card. Many of the tower defense powers are clever and add to the survival puzzle. The art is charming and adds character. The writing style of the rules and cards makes me laugh, and is entertaining and witty. My only negative concern is the player elimination but I believe it plays fast enough that that is not a major concern.

A card drafting defense game for 2-6 players. Each person drafts heroes, then uses the challenge ratings for those heroes to gain traps from a central supply. Using those traps, the players must defend against their chosen heroes. Last player standing wins.

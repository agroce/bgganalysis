An interesting two-player title that has an intriguing feature whereby gaining control of an island removes all connections of the other player from that island. This has the ability to cause a cascade of lost control for that player. 

I like the fast play time, but feel the scoring seems "off" to me. Other than that, it's a nice and simple -- yet thought-provoking -- little title.

Kahuna is great for a quick game between two players. I found that the decisions were agonizing at times, the screwage factor was fun without being infuriating, and I get great satisfaction for a win, but am ok if I lose. Not bad for a quick little game! UPDATE: I do think the victory point assignments are kind of stupid... we just tend to play each round as it's own game, saying whoever gets best of 5 is the overall winner of the evening. This feels much better for us. UPDATE: traded with Alhambra for Ticket to Ride and Ice Cream.

RATING: 6.5
This 2er game a little bit similar to Othello and Thurn & Taxis. Six location cards are placed each turn, this setup is similar to T&T. Black & white bits and gameplay (get control of 1 island will make opponent losing control in other islands) is quite similar to Othello. Not a easy game!

LIKE: Simple rules, yet some interesting, subtle strategies.
DISLIKE: Some luck-of-the-draw. Experienced players can sometimes dominate. Can be head-to-head, confrontational since there is some destroying of bridges involved.
OVERALL: Fun little game, takes time to learn a strategy. I enjoy how laying bridges can be defensive or offensive.

RATING: 5
In a way Kahuna falls into the same category with Ticket to Ride or Thurn und Taxis, i.e., you are collecting cards to claim routes. The only difference is that Kahuna is more confrontational because you can steal once claimed routes from others which also means that Kahuna is prone to becoming a tug war. This latter aspect of the game is not a thing I am too fond of, because if other player manages to get an early lead it might be hard to make a comeback. However, there is still some fun to be had in the game in deciding when to play a card and which cards to pick.

If you play by the rules in the version we have, I'd rate it a 6.  If you play that playing two cards to remove an opponent's bridge allows you to place one of yours in it's place, then it's an 8.  With the rules as written, it was nearly impossible (in the games we played) to come back from any sort of deficit in the first two rounds.

Kahuna is a pretty nice two-player game. It has good artwork and components and it offers a pretty interesting game-play for such an easily portable box. Its mechanisms are very simple, but it's fascinating how they manage to create a very tense back-and-forth experience. It's particularly exciting when, through that simple card play, you are able to cause a chain-reaction that changes everything on the board. That's really the best thing about Kahuna!

The game doesn't come without some minor flaws though. On one hand, while the luck factor is not overly dominant, it is still present and sometimes it can really mess up your plans. This is not a huge deal, since the game plays so fast, but it's worth mentioning it. On the other hand Kahuna doesn't have unfortunately a variable set-up nor a game-play that is rich enough to make you want to play it particularly often. Especially due to the fact that you play three round of the same thing every time it hits the table. It's still cool and interesting... but also repetitive enough to make you satisfied after that one play.

All of this makes Kahuna a nice, interesting and portable game, that it's definitively worth trying out if you don't mind some confrontation. It's just not that couple game that you always want to have with you. Good game, just maybe better played occasionally.

Good game , nothing extraordinary, but as I really favor 2p games I may be a little biased, in general the game felt tight regarding final scoring, speaking of which, the scoring system is rather unusual, and  I've found unofficial alternatives online that I'm comtemplating to try. I enjoyed how quickly things can change as the dominion of an island may generate a domino effect. I think it's worth a try ifyou like abstracts.

One of the best 2 player games from the kosmos series.

Play it with your wife, gf, lover, friend etc, you and they will always come back for more.

Nice little 2 player abstract game. Easy to teach and play. The artwork is nice and colourfull.

A really fun and neat two player 'abstract'. 'Abstract' in quotes in that I usually consider abstracts to be colorless and overly consuming of one's mind, but the colorful board and components help to lighten the mood when I play this and add a little bit more fun for me. Definitely some luck of the draw in this, but plays quick so works well as a short two player game to play when waiting for the rest of the group to show up or for a game another group is playing to end. Simple rules, but not simplistic gameplay with the various combos/ island interactions really making this game fun for me.

decent abstract.  i'm not sure how you come back when you're down, but even if you could i don't see how the scoring lets it happen.  i'd need several more plays to have a line on its luck factor.  my 2p games tend to have more or less meat than this though, so sitting in the middle i'm not sure it's worth owning.

From the first time I saw this game at our local toy store, I wanted it.  But it's too chaotic to enjoy.  At the end of each round, we both make our big plays and everything changes dramatically.  I feel like it should be a tactical game, but at the end it feels very random.

Likely the top game in the Kosmos 2-Player series.  It is abstract, so that will likely decide whether it is favorably received or sent packing.  Combines a nice balance of strategy and chance (card draws) in a quick playing little game.  My personal favorite in the series. [GTI Code: APCD]

I like the combination of card play and area control.  Not a game I get excited to play but pleasant.  Although there is some take that involved it is no worse than say Othello in that regard.  Its a semi abstract game and I think it will work well with some players in that there is enough luck in the draw for a weaker player to get a chance or not see how they are in trouble for not getting or managing cards right.  Less "scary" to some players than games that are deeper and more interesting to me so might get games of this at some point.

Once my favorite Kosmos 2-player game I still enjoy it as you teeter back and forth for area control by breaking your opponents bridges as you build yours. Unique three round scoring system means you can get walloped in the 1st 2 rounds and still win (all be it an uphill climb).  The new packing is silly as the thickness is 1 1/2 x's bigger for no good practical reason other than a Jedi mind trick.

RATING: 4
Utterly forgettable light abstract.  The beginning of the second and third rounds is often a draw-fest to see who can first get a card to build a bridge in a crucial spot.  It's also nigh impossible to turn the game if you lose the first round -- the latter two rounds are nothing more than a chance for the winning player to turn a slight lead into an all-out whomping.

Simple, clean & clever, with a little bit abstracts. I firstly played it several times on BGA but felt it dull then. With physical game played on tabletop, this is quite a pleasant game to play. Quite good a Kosmos 2-player.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.1
Preferred this 2P version to the 3-4 player Kanaloa. Much more skill and strategy (whereas it all tends to be lost in the chaos of the 4p game).

Clever application of cards at the right time allows you to rip out your opponents bridges and win over chains of islands. Get the timing right and you have the game.

Kahuna is essentially an area-control abstract game with a pasted theme: since it also plays like an unpretentious abstract, the glued theme doesn’t feel as annoying as you’d think.

I was expecting more of a see-saw battle, but once my opponent got a lead I found there was little I could do.  I tried the variant, and that helped a little, but still.  I see what it is the designer was trying to do, but I feel it sadly came up short.

RATING: 7
I like how this one constantly changes and you have to work at keeping your plans secret.

Update after 7 years...I bumped to a 7. I did abstracts and there is a lot going on this this short brain burner.  What cards are coming up, burying cards you don't want someone to see while working on building a hand to do a big move or to continually make small moves.  The quality of the game is excellent as well as the look.  Glad it hit the table again.

Great 2-player.  I prefer it with the rule that if you force the removal of an opponent's bridge you replace it with a bridge of your own.  Without that rule it is too static.  With the rule it is a clever fluid game which rewards both attacking and defensive play.  Small amount of luck invloved, and you are unlikely to win if you don't note which cards your opponent picks up.  HIghly recommended.

Very strange. My fiancee has no problem ripping me a new one with gleeful abandon when it's "Hey, That's My Fish!", but for some reason she says that the even more upfront nature of this game's "the only way to win is to dismantle the other player" causes her to not enjoy it. Weird. I figured the fact that there is nothing to it [i]but[/i] destroying the other player would appeal to her. I look at it more like an obfuscated Othello/Reversi. You don't really "own" anything in this game (these are not [i]your[/i] islands, these are not [i]your[/i] bridges) -- instead, you are manipulating the shifting black and white patterns so that at the end, your particular color is dominant. Anyway, we've only played it once, so I don't feel like I can rate it yet.

Surprisingly deep game - the more I play the deeper I realise it is. Definitely helps if you can card count (there is only 24 cards to keep track of). Player skill far outweighs any luck of the draw, but you can offset by giving the weaker player more cards to start the game.

Kahuna is a game about two opposing players trying to dominate an archipelago. To do this you need to play cards to build bridges connecting islands, the player with the majority of the bridges to an island controls that island. But there are ways for your opponent to throw a wrench into your plans and this can have far reaching consequences.

I was not a fan of this one. Gameplay is incredibly repetitive and the number of choices you have is so limited that I was bored stiff the entire time, and felt as though I had no control over the game. The three rounds also lasted far too long for my taste. However, I was utterly destroyed in our first play, so maybe I'm just bitter.

[u]October 2008:[/u] Just one play with my girlfriend and she was kinda sick so I won way too easily. I feel like I'm going to like this one but hey... After one weird game, who knows?

[u]November 2008:[/u] I played a second time with Matthieu and really liked it, the game is tense and there is a little strategic planning.

[u]May 2009:[/u] Played 2 other games with Laurène and I must say I really like this game. It goes fast, there is a bit of a combo element, some nice thinking ahead and a good amount of interaction, both direct (you blast the other player's bridges) and indirect as you need to keep track of what cards the other one is taking to block him and anticipate what he'll do.
I've also lent the game to my parents and they both really liked it (from what they tell me) though my mother thinks it's a bit heavier than Lost Cities.

Overall a good game.

Decent abstract game that can be quite challenging- I like short, simple games like Kahuna where sweeping, opponent-crushing plays are possible.  It's not something I care to own or play often, but if it's available and there's only 15 minutes until Dune starts up, I wouldn't turn it down.  I'd rather the designer skipped trying to apply a stupid, nonsensical theme to it.

This is my kind of game. I am fan of area control games, and this is a short, simple to play game that has some depth (given its length). While there is still some luck based on the cards that are available to draw, it is more about the timing of when you play cards and how you position your bridges to give them maximum effect (and reduce your own vulnerability to attack).

You need to be very careful when taking out other players bridges because it costs you lots of cards and if they are able to rebuild quickly it could end up costing you a lot (as if they are able to retake control, you end up losing bridges in the process).

Kahuna is one of the first modern style boardgames I ever bought. It was way back in 2003, when I just met my sweetheart, and we were bored and looking for a nice game to play. One of the local shops had a sale at that time, where we got the SoC cardgame and this title. I had no idea whether it would be fun or not, but the bright colours of the box and its description intruiged me. (My, how far I've progressed beyond box appeal to decide whether or not to buy a game...) Kahuna is a modern variety on a tug of war. Players play cards from their hands, strengthening their influence on imaginary islands with Polynesian-sounding names. Once your influence reaches more than half of the available 'slots' on the island, it becomes yours, and allows you to kick out all the influence your opponent built up. Since influence always ties two islands together, clever play can cause a chain reaction of players losing ownership of islands. 

Although I don't play Kahuna anymore save with my sweet dear mother, the game has never lost its appeal completely. Although it has a tendency to become a little repetitive, and make it very difficult for a player to come back from a weakened position in time for scoring (which feels artificial and out of place, to be honest), there is something satisfying in setting up a kick-the-other-off-of-his-islands trap and executing it without a hitch.

[b]Update[/b] I have since discovered that the game always degenerates into a situation where a player has such a strong grip on a set of neighbouring islands that his position there is unassailable. As this is something which arrives through luck of the draw, the game is basically 'solved' (or 'broken'). The final three or four games I played all ended like that... and it's not fun. I fear there is little to be done about this unless the overall scoring rules are altered. Alas, such a variant does not (yet) exist. Lowered the rating even more.

This game is just too abstract for me.  I also feel that the randomness inherent in the card draws can end up hosing you with no opportunity to come back.  Tried this once and don't feel a need to play it again.

RATING: 6
First play was good.  I came from behind in the all valuable third round, but my son just beat me with a last minute control of a final island.  This is one that I am going to have to play a few more times before I can really start to wrap my brain around it.  Unlike so many of the Kosmos two-player games that appeal to one's better half, I can see Kahuna getting the thumbs down from mine.  Think I will spare myself that.  My rating will probably change after another game or two.  2008-04-27: donated game to Diabetes Fundraiser

Rating still the same after another play.  Not a favourite, but would certainly play if asked.

RATING: 3
The rating of 3 is for the standard game with considerably incomplete easy access to public information. I'd rate the rule variant 2 from p. 6 of the rules a little better (3.5), because it leaves cards lying open that the opponent drew openly. I'd finally rate the version programmed on Yucata.de with a 4. It consists of the rule variant 2 and also shows you which cards have already been played in the current round.

Solid 2-player game. A bit too dependent on luck, due to the fact you really need to pick the right cards in order to try and land your best moves.

A neat area majority game, although it seems to be biased towards whoever ends up being able to start in the "east", i.e. towards Aloa. The "cheap" islands there can make it easier to gain a majority over the other player early and maintain it.

RATING: 4
Clever little game about island control.  Players acquire and play cards to form links between islands.  If you get a majority of links from an island, you boot your opponent off the island, which could start a chain reaction.  Remake of Arabana-Ikibiti, with better components.  Downrated after a recent playing - too boring, and too difficult to get anywhere once the board fills.

Kahuna appears to be game about controlling islands, but its more about destroying your opponents bridges. Timing when to take control of an island is crucial. Intuition would have you believe that controlling an island as soon as possible is preferred. But in reality you want to bait your opponent to lay down a few bridges, and then snatch control, thereby destroying their bridges in the process. A two birds for one stone type deal. Its this element that turns me off. It takes time and cards to setup such moves, leading players to draw, draw, draw, draw, place, place, place, repeat. This leaves the game too often in a stagnant state, and then swing dramatically in another direction. There is certainly room for competition, but not my cup of tea.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Kind of an area influence game. You want the majority of bridges to an island in order to place a stone of your own upon it. However, bridges connect 2 islands, so they count for majority in 2 places. If an opponent "captures" an island, you lose all your bridges to that island. This can have a ripple effect. Nice little 2 player abstract.

I figured out some ways to get this to work during the game play itself, but we missed the bit on third round scoring, and that colored the overall experience, as in "no hope for the player who lost rounds one and two."

I consider that a minor glitch in the rules, which makes it sound as if 2 points per round happens for round two and beyond.  Turns out you score the difference in that round, which can enable a player who's behind to pull an upset.  I'd judge it difficult, but possible, and that makes the game a bit nicer in my mind.   I bumped the rating up two points.   (Always with the two points... didn't that already get me into trouble?)

Beautiful board. The cards are well designed, it's easy to find the islands. The bits and the box insert are well done. But the game is a bit too long for what it is and I don't understand the strategy at all. I have no idea why I win or lose.

Once an island has a majority of your bridges, you "own" it -- at least temporarily. Has the same light, abstractly detached strategy feel of Lost Cities and Balloon Cup, and about the same amount of attraction. [? traded for this. Sold.]

Interesting control card game which I liked very much until I realized that the discard pile becomes a secondary way  for deducting what the opponent is holding.  I guess with a gentleman's agreement it is possible to overlook that and go by memory.  Of course then this favors the card counters.  There are lots of opportunities for turning the tables on the opponent but overall, once you're set it is difficult to be displaced from the border island.  The inner islands are for the foolhearty or the one holding all the right cards.  Nice domino effect can be produced if timed appropriately.

Dry to me.  It just doesn't seem that fun and I don't really get how to play it well.  Doesn't work with my brain, maybe it's too much looking ahead and planning.  I just don't see the big moves very well.  The game play reminds me of 1960 the making of the president.  I do something on my turn and you undo it on your turn.  Back and forth we go until it's over.  For me it lacks a satisfying feeling of progress.

O tabuleiro é um conjunto de ilhas. Nós devemos usar cartas com os nomes das ilhas para construir pontes interligando-a com as ilhas vizinhas. Se você tiver a maioria das pontes a ilha é sua. Ao final de cada uma das três rodadas ocorre uma pontuação de acordo com as ilhas dominadas por cada jogador. O jogo da umas reviravoltas pois ao dominar uma ilha as pontes do outro jogador são, imediatamente, retira e isso gera um pequeno caos alterando bastante configuração das ilhas dominadas. Tem um visual muito bonito. Regras super simples. Rapidinho. Gostoso de jogar.

Kahuna plays out rather diffently depending on who you play with. Sometimes all but a few of the islands are under player control shortly after the first scoring round, sometimes many of the islands are still unoccupied by the end of the second round. In the former case, it feels like the game lasts just a tad too long. It's still very enjoyable and one of the best 2p games. Lots of direct interaction.

I gave a 7 only when I decided to use some home rules about gameplay and scoring...
a) You can't build bridges on free lines that belong to isles which are controlled - in that moment - by your opponent.
a) The first player who win 2 rounds (2-0 or 2-1: every round is 1 point) is the winner.

  We really enjoyed it, and great game while we were waiting to start a bigger game. I lost badly,but had a great time, and decided I still really wanted it in my game closet. While I was concentrating on placing bridges, my opponet, was focusing on removing my bridges and remove my piece from island for dominating it. Once you don't have the majority of bridges on an island, you have to remove your round piece. I started out with many, and ended with few.  Not a long game, and fun. Still not sure what is the best strategy for it, but can't wait to get my own copy next time I'm in the store.

Quite challenging for such a simple game. The situation on the board changes so rapidly that you lose concentration for one minute and you lost the play. And in spite of its tactical challenges it doesn't take long to play Kahuna.

RATING: 7
Direct conflict between nodes of varying numbers of connectors.  There is a significant element of chance with the cards, but clever play will mostly mitigate that.  This can be a very harsh game for a new player against one with more experience.  Comebacks are not as impossible as some suggest, but they definitely require a sufficiently strong position to build from.

I originally bought it as a game to learn and play with Karis as a game with direct conflict but only one opponent (so no "picking on" anyone).  It never clicked with her, so she hates it, but I quite like it.

Nicely designed game - another that's easy to learn, difficult to master, quick to play. That said, even the most experienced player can find their game-plan going awry due to the absence of available cards at the right time. Complete control of an island is very hard to shift, and a lucky opening hand or two for one player can shift the balance of the game inexorably one way.

2-Player Game

One of my most favorite 2 player games. You can screw your opponent right if you get your strategy right and remember what cards got played. I don't count all the cards, but I try to remember the last few one played. Looks awesome when situation changes on the board drastically in favor of the opponent. 

Really, really enjoyable game. Could be played for hours on end in my mind. After 100 and some games online, I wish I could play this more often on the table.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Kahuna is a good game, but it's not gentle -- a powerful attack often leaves the victim more vulnerable to further attacks. Very often there's a chain reaction in which one side can be absolutely decimated as he/she loses bridge after bridge. With experience you'll realize when the situation becomes hopeless and concede the game at that point.

This trait is rare among German-type games and as such, it's not one I recommend for casual players.

I liked this game quite a bit when I first got it, but I've since cooled. The strategies seem pretty limited, but it's still a nice little game.

For someone who really likes 2 player strategy and hand management, I think this one is ok. For me, though, the decisions felt very limited (having a small hand size, only being allowed to draw 1 card per turn, only 3 cards to choose from), making it extremely difficult to plan ahead, and the game seemed to go on for far too long for what little action there was.

Good game, very tactical, defense (by choosing the right cards) being of increasing importance as the islands fill up.  Would like to play more, as I&#039;m sure the game would be quite different under different card draws and conditions.  (Depending on how much or little players attack one another, as opposed to building their own control, and also how many cards are available in the opponents part of the board...lots of different things I can see affecting the game play, and thus keeping the game fresh/different)

One of the few games which achieves area majority (my favorite mechanic) with 2 well -- Kahuna does this by: 1. making placements dictated by a deck of cards (and some hand management); making every placement count towards two regions; 2. kicking out the minority player once a region's majority player reaches the majority threshhold (e.g., 3 out of 5 connections). The implications of how these two combine means that a well-timed locking in of a majority allows for the possibility of taking advantages of other openings created to produce a devastating turn of events. The hand limit, scoring rounds, and cost of directly and outright removing connections (i.e., 2 cards) create tempo-based opportunities that push players to not simply hold onto cards indefinitely waiting for a big move.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I've played this a lot over the years, and always enjoyed it. However, the third round is often kind of a letdown as positions are pretty well shored up by the end of the second. Still, pulling off one of those big chain-reaction moves and breaking into a well defended area is a treat. There's nothing quite like it.

Interesting 2 player effort about placing bridges to connect islands and control territory in what i assume is Hawaii. Card play dictates where one can place a bridge and strategy dictated by hand management. Choices include playing cards early and having no hand and lots of bridges/territory or hoarding a hand and hoping to play a pair of cards to remove opposition bridges and steal territrory. Game is played over 3 rounds

Played 2 games back to back with my girlfriend.
and that means she liked it! In fact, we both liked it. Its simple, fast, the wind can turns anytime soon. There's more strategy then it seems, a bit of luck that obligates you to ever change your strategy.
This is a keeper!

A back-and-forth board position game for two players.  And that's really all it is. It's not really my thing, it seems to offer some pointlessly irresolvable struggles: I put this bridge here! You take it off! I put it back! Of course, this is limited by cards, but the game needs to offer more than that to excite me. (1 play)

Fun little two player.  Although after some repeated play, not as free flowing as I would like.  Once a player does get entrenched in an area, very hard to knock out.  Beginning players will see this as very chaotic, but when they discover the ability to defend, the tides of the game don't shift as much.

Kahuna is decievingly simple and surprisingly strategic over the seemingly back and forth tactical nature of the game.  The first time I read the rules, I couldn't see why choosing not to draw a card in order to force your opponent to would be a good idea, but now I see how important it is in controlling the final moments of a closing round.  Likewise, holding back on cards while you slowly lose control over the islands isn't as damning as it initially appears since reclaiming a lost island can be potentially more damaging to your opponent than spending your resources to fight continually over it.  I'm eagar to try the "longterm" variant soon to see if it's as good as the base game.

I like this kind of game, but I thought I'd like this one a bit more than I actually do.  Maybe it's that the game feels very confrontational - not sure.

Taxes the brain a bit.  The one downside is that a bad run of card draws (or even sometimes a single card draw) can easily put you in a situation from which it is extremely hard to recover.

I actually like this game a lot.  This is what I expected T&E to be like.  It does seem a little dry and formulaic after awhile though.

We bring it out every now and then, and I find it has weathered well.  There are multiple strategies to try, and each game plays out at least a little bit different.  Do try the variant that a double card will remove *and* replace an opponent's bridge.  It makes the board much more volatile.

This is so far my least favorite of the Kosmos 2-player games I have tried.  (Jambo and Odin's ravens have been my favorites, but I also enjoyed Lost Cities, Hera & Zeus, and Ceasar and Cleopatra.  This game boils down to an abstract thought puzzle with an island theme pasted on.  (It is however a beautiful theme which is fitting for the underlying game and which is conveyed with a nice board of colorful islands and nice wooden pieces.)   

However, the underlying abstract game is dull.  It encourages card-counting and card-hoarding resulting in several turns where neither player does anything but draw in order to reach a full hand of five.  Because of the card counting problem and the fact that you can play all five cards in your hand at once,the winner is determined by who can leverage their memory of what has been played and manage the luck of the draw to deliver a killing blow by playing their entire hand at the end of the round.  Instead of being fun, the game just felt like a dull memory exercise.

Area majority:hand management:abstract:screwage

A nice little strategy game that really is themeless. There are some choices you can make during play albeit the pace is fast and it still feels light. A really nice option is the ability to not play a card at all and store up cards so you can play a run of them all at once allowing for some really brilliant moves. You really should only play that when a "pair" is played and a bridge is destroyed yours immediately replaces it WITHOUT another card, this is critical to the balance IMO. 

Sometimes you want to play more tactically playing easy cards to fill empty spots before they are gone, or picking up short term goal cards. Other times you plan ahead a little (5 cards max limits your planning however) and it is worth saving a few cards to destroy bridges and/or take over majorities. Either way you always need to be thinking defensively and offensively. Luck is there a little but with 3 cards face up it is quite manageable and this also helps you to watch which cards your opponent is picking up.

Fast pace, 20 to 30 minutes in length and some substance makes a decent 2 player game great for weeknights. I'm not sure if further playings will reveal optimal strategies boiling it down to card draw which might also be the case with 2 very equal players, will update after more plays. 

[u]UPDATE:[/u]7 => 7.5 Catching the leader is certainly not a problem, anyone experiencing this problem has the rule wrong I am sure as the game has a lot of back and forth making some swings in power or maybe they don't get the game. The domino effect is really cool and using it right before scoring can be the key to winning, good game.

It’s been years since I last played Kahuna so I don’t remember much!

However I do remember I thought the game was almost pointless. The decisions are glaringly obvious and there is a lot of luck with the cards.

I recently bought it for the iPad, so perhaps I will play it again soon. When I do I will come back to expand my comment.

7 - Good game, usually willing to play ('Geek Definition).I just broke this out again last weekend (1/3/05) and was struck by how similar Ticket To Ride is to this mechanically speaking. They are NOT the same game and each is different and good to own...(almost must owns for bringing in new gamers), but if you play them both you may catch what I'm saying, but I could be whacked too. :) Kahuna is one that catches my fancy now and again. It's very tactical and yet allows for some long term playing as you get used to it. It uses hand management of the cards as the device of play. The cascading of control and Kahuna stones across the islands is a blast when it goes in your favor. There is a rule I blew on my recent playing and it isn't clearly stated in the rule book: ANY time you loose the majority of bridges on the island your Kahuna stone is removed (say a bridge is removed from an island and both players now have equal ammounts of bridges on the island...Kahuna stone is removed). My flawed take was that the stone is removed only when a bridge has been played by the other player and all of your bridges are removed from the island because he has gained majority on it. Just a heads up. This is a light game that often garners replay requests. It won't light your world up per se, but it is a good filler for two. It is direct interaction and messing with the other players, but isn't mean spirited. It's what the contest is about. Worthwhile game for two and I'd reccommend it.

Two plays n 15 years might suggest I don't like this, but that's not the case.

Simple rule in this card-driven, two player game might suggest there's not a lot to think about, but that's not the case. Most significant decisions revolve around tempo (in any given turn you can play as many cards as you have in your hand, but regardless of how many cards you play you will draw one new card only at the end of your turn), when to play for defence and when to attack, and which card to draw.

Doesn't outstay its welcome - just the right length for the challenge offered. Loos good too, and sits in the classic small Kosmos box.

Sure there is a bit of luck involved, but for me, two player games need a bit of luck to keep a relatively balanced playing field.  This game tends to feel close then turns to a blowout almost every time I've played - but even getting taken to task isn't the end of the world.  You tend to feel like you are one move away from making a resounding comeback which is needed in a game like this.  Fun, if slightly cutthroat, game.

Just doesn't seem to hit the table very often compared to other two player games.

Kahuna is an excellent introduction to area control and card driven combat. It's complicated scoring means this is a game we just don't play much of.

It's a bit of a brainburner at times, which seems unreasonable for such a short game. Also, once experienced, the draw of the cards can really screw up your play.

RATING: 7
This has a wonderful 'domino' effect to it that makes thinking through each move in detail very exciting. The board is a bit on the random side which makes me wonder what thought process went into deciding which islands go where and how many bridges gets allocated to each, but since the board stays the same, this doesn't detract from the long run. Has a touch of Othello and a lot of originality that it makes for a fun two player session.

Brainstorm ahead! This feels a little bit like chess BUT it isn't even close to it. You have to think your moves carefully: what islands you want and how to get them AND the same time look what your opponent is doing. A good game, but Kahuna is quite heavy stuff so I don't want to play this every day. One of the best Kosmos 2-player games...

RATING: N/A
Originally published in 1997 as Arabana-Ikibiti by the designer's own publisher Bambus Spieleverlag, then reprinted by Funagain in the U.S., Kosmos' Kahuna – part of its Kosmos two-player series – is the best known implementation of this design.

It's a two-player game, played on a board depicting twelve islands. Players use cards to place bridges between these islands or remove opponent's bridges. If you get the majority of bridges around an island, you place one of your marker stones on it and also remove any of your opponent's bridges to that island – which might cause them to lose a bridge majority on an adjacent island and lose a marker stone there.

Very enjoyable two player game. In my wife's eyes, it scratches the same itch scratched by, but doesn't quite match up to, Lost Cities, so it gets played only rarely. It might also have something to do with her having a winning record against me in Lost Cities, but not in Kahuna. :-)

This one annoys me. I love the mechanics of Kahuna, but I just can't do well with it at home. I play maybe 3 games, enjoy the mechanics, but just cannot win (at home). Maybe I do something silly, or maybe Christine is just great at it. The angst worsens such that after the 3rd game I toss it on the back shelf. For a while. Then the mechanics intrigue me again, and back out for another cycle.

When I take it on the road: different story.

[UPDATE] Finally managing to win at Home, yay!

Ken:
Have yet to experience an even game; multiple plays have all resulted in (relatively) large margins of victory without any chance of a change in points leader by the end of the second round.  Interesting mechanics.  If a player is willing to basically count cards, results are more predictable.  Question whether such commitment is worthwhile for a game of this depth.

Would be willing to play again.  No chance of future re-acquisition.

A very enjoyable game that is deeper than it looks. The play falls into two distinct phases. In the beginning you are fairly casually staking out your territory. Once all the islands are controlled, however, the fireworks begin! A bit ruthless, but in a very fun way. The only problem with this game is that it is almost impossible to win if you loose the first two rounds. It is one of the few games we own with this dynamic. When it happens, it is almost not worth finishing the game, since the outcome is almost certainly known.

[b]2015-09-23 5[/b] After 1x 2p:
It's an ok game. The fact that it plays 3 rounds and you don't have to wipe the board gives it a little bit more room for longer term planning. The card draw is fairly random but it does reward players who know when to hold back building to save for one big effective big con(/de)structive turn. If I like (or am better at) abstracts, this will be a 6.

Seriously flawed game as I haven't been able to win against my 8 years old, not once. It's a shame, as being the usual high quality Kosmos game, I like it quite a lot, somehow I just can't wrap my head around this relatively simple, card driven majority game. Most probably my defensive play is too predictable and he always weasels through my islands in the scoring rounds.

Okay two-player game. Requires some strategy, but can sometimes be a bit random when you have a bad run on getting the cards you need. The latter means the game can be open until the very end, but can also mean it's all over half way through the third and final playing round.

This has been in my collection for quite some years now, and has been played a lot. Although it's a bit one dimensional in strategy, it's still more fun than the average fast 2-person filler.The luck of the draw is easily outranged by playing skill. Players have to be matched in skill though, otherwise the better of the two will always win this game easily.

RATING: 6.5
Nice abstract strategy game which requires (not too much) card memorizing to win, but at the same time those card draws prevent excessive ahead-thinking of tens of moves. Like any decent 2 player game, Kahuna offers plenty of ways to lure your opponent into committing to (in this case) connections which you do not really want, but just laying down to get rid of a card - after which you explore the other side of the board.
A drawback is that the game is often decided in the earlier phases, which makes the rest of the game a matter of consolidation - sort of fun but frustrating for the player who is behind.
There is apparently a variant that fixes this but I haven't tried it yet (replacing a connection of your opponent rather than just removing it). I somewhat fear that it devolves the game into chaos but time wil tell.

Abstract game where players draft cards depicting islands which can be played to a) build a bridge between 2 islands or b) remove a bridge (this costs two cards).  If you control over half of the possible island connections then you control the island and all of your opponents connections are removed immediately.  The game seems to have a bit more depth than it first impression and there are some tough tactical decisions (defense versus offense, where to get the most bang for you buck, etc.).  You need to see what cards have already been played to help determine your best choices (based on what cards are left in the deck or in your opponent's hand).

RATING: 6.5
Straightforward majority game, boiled down nicely. Why do I like this and not Australia? I guess just because this is two-player, so there's much greater clarity. I like the partial information with some of the cards being face-up; it gives you enough to make you think out your move, but you can't plan much any further ahead than that. Offers more of a learning curve (in a good way) than most card games.

The yucata implementation is especially nice because it tracks which cards have already been played for you. And the image of the board has creases, which is a nice touch.

Kahuna is a nice game, in theory. It looks gorgeous and plays well. Too bad it falls completely flat every second game. First it's dynamic, exciting and fun, next time you play it's static, drab and the loser can't catch up with the winner after the first losses. Probably there's a great game hiding in there, but I'm not sure I want to dig for it.

Avoid.

One of the better games in the very uneven Kosmos two-player series. If one player doesn't win both of the first two rounds, the third round can be a rich, tense gaming experience. Not a game I'll play over and over, but enjoyable once in a while. [9 plays; gave away]

A quirky two player area control game. Highly abstract - the theme is basically meaningless here, and I almost wish it was completely abstract - the island names and the layout of the game board was slightly distracting - I kept having to recount in my head the number of connections, etc. I did really like the "chain reaction" effect, where removing an opponent's bridge could cause them to lose out on another island, and it created some interesting tactical opportunities. Still, at this point I own enough two-player games that never get played enough so I am at a point now where I don't see owning this. Won't say no to future games of it though.

Fura egy játék. A szabály és a játékmenet alapján kedvemre való, de nem estem hanyatt tőle. Valami hiányzik, illetve úgy érzem, nem igazán tudom mi a jó lépés. Egyszerűen megpróbálom a maximumot kihozni az adott helyzetből, de nem tudom jó e vagy sem (bár eddig nyertem, szóval vszínű, jó).
A kivitelezés gyönyörű, a játékmenet viszont ennek ellenkezőleg gonosz. Ez nem feltétlen baj, de a téma is elég fura. Oké, tudom, absztrakt..

Kahuna is a clever game where cards are played to build bridges between islands to claim majorities. A majority not only claims the island but also removes an opponent bridge so timing is essential. I felt that the cards may drive too much of the strategy and that the end game, when most bridges have been placed, was a bit stagnant, making it difficult to catch up. A similar game like Ponte Diavolo offers more strategic opportunities without cards. Nevertheless, I'd welcome more sessions to be proven wrong.

An enjoyable game.  Some strategy and "screw you" opportunities.  We play this on occasion, but the fun level is not that high and the game has major problems.  We usually play the advanced variant that does not allow you to build a bridge to another person's claimed island.  While this signifigantly improves the game, it also leads to a stagnant game after the 1st round.  This variant also increases the luck factor, b/c any further changes rely very heavily on getting just the right card to cause a signifigant game shift. Finally, there can be A LOT of down time.

Like many of the Kosmos, and two player games in general, this is a back and forth, back and forth, back and forth between the two players.  

The game is ok, but really nothing too exciting about it.  You need two or three of the same island card to build a bridge on an island.  If you own all the bridges to an island you score points, and you can remove your opponents bridges by doing the same.

Back and forth, back and forth, not all exciting.  A tug of war for two.

While wandering through the flea market we saw Kahuna for 3€ and pounced on it. We had already played a handful of games through yucata.de and finally we got ourselves a physical copy. The game is quite fun despite being a bit in your face. We normally don't enjoy "take that" games but with this one it's OK, kinda. You start rather peacefully building bridges and maybe destroying a few by controlling an island but when the board starts filling up the race begins to throw some dynamite and knock those bridges out! That's when the luck of the draw also plays a bit of a role. But overall great simple design.

What looks like a light two-player game is in fact a tough strategic and tactical brain burner.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Solid tactical game, gentle and replayable - due to the luck of the draw it's difficult to plan more than three moves ahead, so the game doesn't get too heady. The initial setup doesn't really bias the game either (more often than not the landscape changes from one evaluation to the other), so loser's pride always leads to another round...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
Could be much better if the stilted gameplay mechanic were revised. It felt slightly unnatural to the extent where we'd always get the box out and realise we were still not quite sure of the rules. A lot of potential with the map, but needs a better draw/play/discard system.

[b]Kahuna[/b] was sold via auction 2/14/16.

[i]I knew going in that this would be a long shot, but I didn't have to break the bank to get a copy so I decided to take a flyer on it hoping it would be a good 2p area control game. Unfortunately it wasn't my cup of tea, I should've listened to Marc (hawk-x-).

I didn't mind the interaction (El Grande is a favorite of mine) what I couldn't handle was the non existent theme pasted over an Abstract game. In my opinion it didn't feel like an area control game at all. Still I'm not sorry that I tried Kahuna, if nothing else it made me realize that looking for a 2p area control game is a fools errand. Area control games require more than 2 players to achieve the type of interaction I look for when playing this type of game.[/i]

It's about building bridges between the 12 islands, gaining bridge majorities around more islands than your opponent. The gameplay is simple - pick up an island card, or play any number of cards to lay down bridges. The early game is one of getting the easy bridges out, staking out territory. You've got to be careful about placing bridges to unclaimed islands, because if your opponent can claim a majority, they get to kick your bridges off. This kick-off feature can provide sweeping domino changes around the board as majorities are lost, then reclaimed, with more kick-offs and more options. From mid-game on, the board is generally locked in and you're looking for card combinations to do kick-offs (you need a pair). Here you need some luck with the cards you get offered, but it's fun when you can kick some serious bridge butt. The gametime is the perfect length for what is a clever little abstract. Turns are quickish and not too taxing (counting the 24 cards definitely helps). The only thing holding it back from a higher rating is that, well, its abstract and doesn't get to the table often.

RATING: 9.5
My brother bought it for me from Germany.

Owning this game makes me proud!

Class, Class, CLASS.

The wooden bridges and the hand symbols are great to see, feel and use. I would play with it even if the gameplay was horrible, just for the feel. 

It actually plays well also. Great interaction, strategic and only a flavour of luck.Great feeling when you make your opponents kahuna tiles disappear. Lots and Lots of replayability. 

Simple to teach (2 minutes, even to non gamers)
Tough to master!

Love it. Thanks bro, I owe you.

However I must point out that novice players or those not willing to plan their moves, will have no chance winning experienced opponents. I personaly loved every game I played trying to do the best I could (even when I lost big), but that could be a major put-off for many people.

***IMPORTANT: I find the luck aspect is almost not there. Try playing with top players in the Board Game Arena and you will see that even if you are an average player, whatever cards you draw, you won't win in a million times. That is the ultimate definition of no luck. The card draw is just there to test the players ability to adjust their plans constantly and within seconds, according to new conditions. Exactly this is the aspect that makes this game interesting and extremely replayable.I played more than 300 games and still starving. Pure skill, no luck!*** 

(Wife's Point of View: The best two player game of all time and I can't play it with her. She likes it a bit better than Hive but still won't play it. Hates strategy games and Kahuna is certainly one)

This is an upcoming favourite of mine. It is surprisingly deep for a 2 player game and more so than Lost Cities. There is no such thing as a secured island for bridges may be removed anytime by your opponent with the right combination of cards. There will seldom a senario where you wish that you opponent was not holding onto the cards you want (unlike Lost Cities and Battleline) and the game does not end when the deck is exhuasted. I would think that this game is one of those hidden gems that just get buried by games which received more hype.

There is clearly a sort of runaway-leader problem for this game: if your opponent can get 6 out of 11 islands, the only thing he has to focus on is defending his position. And if you can't attack him fast enough, he can even start focussing on attacking your islands. The main issue is that is very hard to take over an island. IF and only IF you have almost the majority over an island (let's say is 3 - 2 on an island with 5 connections) your opponent controls, you still need 3 cards to take over majority: 2 to remove the bridge and 1 to put 1 bridge of your own to take over control. That means that from the 4 possible cards (as each island appears 2 times), you need 3 to realize this! 
Off course, if you can succeed, you'll do some serious damage as he will lose 2 connections extra, which opens probably possibilities for some more damage.

Very interesting game with a certain degree of luck making 'make due with what you got' imperative. Card selection, awareness of the opponent's selections, and timing are all good gaming elements.
Two variations in each of the American and Advanced (German) rules make for 4 possible play combinations. With the combination of German rules restriction on building into controlled areas and the American rule on not getting a free build when two cards are used to destroy a bridge (my initial interpretation of the rules), the game appears to be decided after the second round when the board is essentially filled. Third round give and take is unlikely to alter the second round positions. Any early mistake that results in loss of bridges can easily become fatal. If played conservatively and error-free, the game's outcome is dependent on the luck of the draw. 

Other option combinations may alleviate this and make this game a 7 rather the the current 6 rating.

= 2013-02-03 - R: 7.5

Played three times so far and loving it.

Lots of direct confrontation without being mean; some opportunities for neat combos; fantasically functional cards that show both the location of the island and how many bridges each one has right on the card; good components; completely abstract.

This is one of the few games we've played where the best move so often is just to draw another card. You can sit there watching your opponent tear down your bridges and kick you off islands while you build up a powerful hand.

Upon reading the instructions, the scoring for the first two rounds (1 pt if you win the 1st round, 2 pt if you win the 2nd) makes it sound like only the last round really matters (players with majority of islands gets points equal to difference in number of islands controlled), but the difference in islands controlled is almost always within 3, making those 3 points from the first two rounds very important indeed.

Haven't yet tried it with the variant rules, but we kind of suspect we'll like it even more.

UPDATE: My wife and I were not carrying over the bridges from round to round. WAY better when you play it properly!

Better scoring than the original Arabana-Ikibitti minimizes the "runaway leader" problem.  Gameplay does offer some modest deep thought, but still the only decision is whether or not to draw extra cards for a bigger play or to play what you have now.

Wow -- started playing this on the Internet and quickly got hooked and wound up buying the board game. A bit of tactics, a bit of memory, a bit of luck all add up here in an exciting game.

The game is simple to learn and pretty fast to play.  It's probably on par with Ticket to Ride in terms of depth and strategy.  All you need to do is grab the right cards and everything else will fall in place.  Once you have a dominating position over a few islands, it's very hard for the  other player to kick you off.  Not one of my favorites.

Interesting card play and geographical tactics.  I like that the rounds are not independent, and you keep your cards and your placed markers on the map... but that sometimes causes a problem that once once one person is ahead, they'll stay ahead.  But surprise turnarounds do happen.  Card-counting skills (which I lack) would be useful for playing well.

This game seemed light and chaotic at first, but it actually has some depth. Timing is everything. I like how careful card selection and bridge placement allows for the setup of dramatic combos in later turns.
The hand limit seem to be a double-edged sword -- it prevents the lead player from "sitting" on cards the other player needs, but it also makes it harder for the losing player to stage a comeback.
The game definitely needs to be played with someone of similar skill, otherwise victory is almost certain for the experienced player.

One of my favorites. Tactics and beauty combine to make this a wonderful game. I play (almost) entirely from the face-up cards, and find that this minimizes luck and allows me to plan ahead a bit.

As with all of this series, the components are nice and the artwork is great.

A very interesting take on the idea of area control.  It seems imperative that you pay very close attention to the cards that your opponent is taking, as well as the cards that have already been played.  If you do this, and your opponent does not, you should be able to win easily.  Otherwise, the game seems awfully banal and random.  Fortunately, there is not that large of a deck.

RATING: 2.5
I was disappointed by it as it was one of 2 players games that seemed interesting on paper. Thing is technically it's an aggressive two player game, kinda, sorta. I mean first round it is, then it gets hard to do anything - destroying other player's pieces is hard to accomplish (2 same cards?!). From second round on the card deck feels more like this huge immovable obstacle than something you can play with. So it's opaque and you probably need to work around its weird mechanisms instead of working with them. The idea and theme is pleasing, but doesn't really work, I feel. 

EDIT: obviously I wasn't taught this game correctly, would need to play by correct rules.

One of the stronger 2-player Kosmos offerings. Players use cards to place bridges out of islands. Majority control of the bridges allows a marker to be placed on islands.

The first round usually involves whacking a whole lot of bridges. The second and third is when the fun bgins: players try to remove opponents bridges, and in turn markers and gain control.

A little luck involved with selection of cards. But control swings back and forth and there's usually a fair bit of tension.

What a delightful game with elegant mechanics. Although the luck of the draw can be harsh, the nature of the card play is so open-ended that the random factor is definitely cut down.

Kosmos took an abstract strategy game, adding a solid theme, kept the rules and actions simple and created a lean and clean implementation of an area-control game. This is one one of the better 2 player games out there that leans fairly heavy on strategy, yet adds a dose of luck (w/the card draws). A strong recommendation to buy especially since it's very affordable to get a copy with a 2nd printing.

When I first bought this we played it over and over and over again.

But I still think it's a fun little game and would play it with someone if they wanted to play it.

A neat 2 player game, nothing too fancy, yet you do need to use your head with this one. So, even though it is tricky I don't get pulled in, not really. I noticed after several plays, that once the game favors one player it is almost impossible to turn it around again in the following rounds, meaning it is one of those where you are either one the winning or the losing side for most of the game, that is boring and really dragging its rating down for me. Maybe it would work better with more players, like Kanaloa? Have to figure it out but right now even winning is lame with this game.

The least enjoyable of the two payer games series.  I think it is a good game but the higher nuances escape most people who play it.....thus turning them off.  They know they are there but can't master them.  I like it but of three I have had try it none want to play again.

Simple and diverting connection ("connection majority"?) game. It feels like a brainburner, but I suspect that the weight is a little illusory -- card-randomness did not feel like a major factor, which seems improbable. At least for now, I enjoy it a lot.

We enjoy our abstracts but this is way overrated, not sure why all the love for this. We tried to like it but found it just average and forced ourselves to finish the second play. Very hard to stop someone in lead, too dependent on drawing the right cards, and a repetitive tug-of-war. Not fun at all.

Okay for 30 minutes - the board at least is pretty to look at.  Fun to set up a chain of bridge-sinkings and construction that robs your opponent of multiple islands all at once.  Warning: may cause relationship stress should that happen.  Warning #2:  seems that there is an optimal strategy -- dominate all islands you control so if you ever lose one bridge you still have control, and never play a bridge onto an island if an opponent looks like they'll have a chance to take control (and destroy your bridge in the process)

I really like how this game changed in feeling and strategy between the different phases. It's a lot more strategic than you might think and reminds me of Hellas without the cards (and without the plastic bits that fall over). Downside of that is I am equally bad at this game as I was at Hellas :( ETA- further plays have highlighted a substantial runaway leader problem. I loose plenty of games; none as infuriating as this one.

I kind of like this game, but not really enough to play it that often.  The domino effect of bridges switching sides was interesting and made for cool back and forth play.

A fun game of tug-of-war on multiple fronts, and big turns with huge turnovers.  Unfortunately, card counting is a big chunk of the game, and I don't care much for that.

A sneaky two-player game that combines hand management with area control. The back and forth struggle for control of islands is filled with tension. The fact that you can sabotage your opponent's bridges by taking control of an island adds an extra, and welcomed, layer of strategy. I would surely play this one again. In some ways, it reminds me of King of Siam.

I'm a huge fan of area control, but this isn't really my favorite implementation of it. It plays out in three rounds, but the game is pretty much always given to the person who won the second round. The rounds are just too short oftentimes to make up a two-point deficit. But I do enjoy the bridge mechanic; it can make for some intense chain reactions. Rules are excellent, as per Kosmos' usual. The quality of the pieces are average, but fun. And it's a nice, quick 2-player so that means it can get played frequently. Still, I think I'd rather reach for Samurai or Dynasties for my area-control fix, but I'll always play it if someone asks.

Another game at which I consistantly see the right move one turn after it's too late and my opponent is already one step ahead.

Very nice ripple-effect when you take control of the right island(s) at the right time and see all the other player's control collapse - feels right with the watery theme.

An interesting card-based abstract. The cards don't introduce luck so much as they introduce variety, which is always good. It has room for interesting plays and chains, and I'd like to play more. I like the amount of meanness it has - you have to work for it, and it has to be used correctly.

Just broke this one out after a loooong hiatus.  It surprised me - i enjoyed it much more than i had expected.  Fun, light game for 2.

I am still bothered by 2 things that prevent the game from ranking higher:  the 3 phase scoring seems... off.  Or artificial.  Something.  Also, i cannot help but feel that there are too few cards.  This makes it too easy for your opponent to block your plans, and makes plans in general too hard (waiting for the right card takes far too long) - contrast this to the card-collection in something like Ticket to Ride.

Maybe these 2 bothersome things could be fixed together with a bigger deck and only 2 (or 1?) scoring round...

At any rate, i now want to play it more, so the rating may increase.

update:  upped to a 7.  more recent plays with my nearly-8 yr old son.  he took to it wildly (and kicked my arse one round by something like 13:2 -- an 11 point round in which i had to - possibly illegally - grant him a couple of extra island tokens).  i am enjoying it too.  still not sure i love the 3 scoring rounds...  would it work with a larger deck, or would it affect the swinginess of the game what with there being far more of each island...

Nice 2-player filler which not only looks intriguing, but also seems to get better the more you play it. That said, luck plays a large role as the randomly drawn cards determine your options (or lack thereof). Play with the standard rules, as the optional rule makes it even more difficult to remove opponent's bridges and consequently brings the game to a stalemate rather too quickly.

Fun game, I've only played once so far, but was amused by how quickly the board can turn. My advice to anyone playing is to make sure you solidify your ownership of an island.

My rating is based on 4 plays at Board Game Arena. I love this game. It has the perfect combination of strategy and tactics, and between the face-up cards and the fact that there are only 24 cards in the deck, you usually have a pretty good idea of what your opponent is capable of. However, this does not make the decisions easy in the slightest, as the many uses for a card lead to agonizing decisions. Deliciously tense two-player game.

Magician priests duel over the control of a group of south pacific islands by forming networks of "magical bridges" to link them. Essentially a card-driven abstract for 2 players. Game is well produced for the price; mounted board, wooden bits - I especially like the wooden "stone markers" featuring the game's iconic hand print logo. I enjoyed my few plays of Kahuna. It's relatively quick, features a strong hand-management component, it is fairly strategic/tactical, and card draw adds variability to each play.

A 1v1 game that is part of the KOSMOS 2 player series. 

Basically you are just putting down brides between islands to gain control of them. This is done over three different rounds and your goal is the try to get the majority of islands after each round. 

The game itself is pretty good. There is a decent amount of luck with drawing, but there is also a pool of face up cards that you can take from as well to minimize the luck aspect. My biggest issue with this game (that some people might actually like) is that it can get really nasty. You are intentionally trying to usurp islands from the other player and it is too tense for my tastes. 

Decent 2 player game, but one that I would be fine with never playing again.

Kosmos 2 player game; players use cards to place or remove bridges from a collection of islands. If you get the majority of bridges around an island, you put one of your marker stones on it and also throw off any of your opponents bridges. That may mean they no longer have a majority of bridges on the adjacent island and so lose a marker stone. Re-implements Arabana-Ikibiti; Re-implemented as: Kanaloa

A simple two player abstract where you build a network of connections between islands while trying to control the most islands.

I really just don't get this game. I'm sure it has some depth, because I always lose, but I've never enjoyed the process enough to dig in and see why.

fun strategic two player game.  I love having to make the bridges to gain the island in your favor.  Its always a great time when the game has a back and forth pull and its always a game that I want to set up and play again.  I like when playing a card causes a chain reaction that allows your opponent to lose so much.  fantastic kosmos two player line of game with great strategic thinking and overall fun to play.

Kahuna is a very well done abstract tactical game and one of the best in the Kosmos 2-player series. But we do not play it that often any more. I can't put my finger on the why, but somehow it did not stand the test of time as good as others from the same series (e.g. Lost cities).

Played several times. A game with interesting ideas, but it feels a bit too dry and abstract to me - meaning I would like to spend much more time calculating the best play than would be enjoyable (both for me and my opponent).

I tried it and hated it right away. But i gave it another shot and it was ok, but i dislike it after all. It is just so restrictive and limiting. You don't have good cards to draw or miss best move and then you sit there cornered with one island and watch your opponent devastate you for another 2/3 of a game and you can't do anything about it. No come back possibility at all. And it is dull, it aged badly. Uninspiring artwork and style. And i get annoyed too quickly by looking at every bridge building or removing possibilities every turn (look at your cards, look at the map, look at your cards, over and over again).

I really want to like this game but I can't. The parts and the general idea are both beautiful, the game promises a very cheerful and relaxed playing experience. Also nice to have a full gaming board fitting into the small box as two player only games are often just made of cards and/or dice. Orientation on the board can be a bit tedious because of the very similar island names. But my biggest problem with the game is that it feels too "tight". Especially when loosing an island it is very difficult to get it back again because the rounds and the whole game both end very fast. Many times you wait for an island to get occupied by your opponent just to strike back and trigger a chain reaction. So the game often is not about getting the islands for yourself but more about destroying your opponent.

I would have liked this game on a bigger scale with more options and support for more players. Or in a smaller variant with less islands and connections for two players only. Feels like a compromise to squeeze a big boardgame into the two player format but does not quite succeed in that aspect. You have to think about your next move quite heavily but in the end it does not matter that much because you can not calculate properly what your opponent will do (especially when he is drawing cards them from the deck). Very competitive, very hectic, quite frustrating.

Sweet little area control game.  We were calling this Twilight Struggle light for a little while. Though after enough plays, I can see how this might wear a little thin. 

This game annoys the heck out of me because against random people I can never win, against friends, I crush them. Needs to get gone!

Simple mechanic but pretty deep little game. You play cards to lay bridges between islands. Once you have a majority of the bridges from any one island, you control it and all your opponent bridges from that island are removed from the board. That can have a ripple effect. It's basically an abstract with a thin theme, but has a high replayability because of the random distribution of the starting cards. Well worth owning.

I don't know what to think of Kahuna.  First game, I thought I had it figured out...then the next game, my wife slaughters me.  Is it the luck of the cards?  Is it that I suck?  Is the game playing me?  Is it that once you're down, it's hard to come back?  You decide!

Very interesting struggle for two players.  Guessing which cards to keep for offensive or defensive purposes keeps the suspense fairly high as you try to break your opponent's control over here, while she tries to break yours over there in such a way that it cascades and destroys your foothold where you were hoping to get control.  Good stuff.

Kifejezetten két főre hangszerelt, teljesen absztrakt játék. Kártyákat húzunk, azok segítségével tesszük le vagy vesszük fel a hidakat, és többségi területszerzés esetén uraljuk az adott szigetet. Közepes hosszúságú, nem az a tízperces kategória, de nagyon jó. Egy pillanat alatt meg tud változni az állás, így hamar rabul ejt a hirtelen váltásaival, végig izgalmas marad az egész.

Lavish board game for 2. Lovely board illustrations. Simple mechanics that work well, (if a bit simplistically). This game is fine as it is, and for a couple seeking a relaxing (if slightly cutthroat) 30 minutes, this fits the bill. 

I wish it had a bit more meat to it. Maybe make the bridges a type of currency which is used to buy cards. Upcoming cards can be bought now, but for an increased cost - that sort of thing.

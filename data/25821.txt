GAME: The Werewolves of Miller's Hollow
RANK: 724
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
An absolutely great game for 9+ people.  Okay it has its downsides - a popularity contest, the bummer of being one of the first 2 people who are effectively killed at random, but played with a good group of people it is hard to beat, especially at night, in the open air, with alcohol, next to a graveyard, under a full moon.  Which I have done....
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Decent edition of original Werewolf; the two biggest benefits of this one (the mini edition) in particular are that it's not expensive to acquire, and second, it's small and can be transported easily. Iconography is sort of weird at times and the paper "cards" are sort of flimsy and prone to (noticeable) bending if you're not careful. Standard problems still apply; it's something that I would only play at a con as the downtime if you get eliminated requires lots of games be present so you can jump in another one and the first round or two are often just trash because you sort of have to kill someone.

It does not matter which version of Werewolf you play, they all are the same experience dependent on the group you play with. In this particular edition you get nice cards of good sturdy cardboard, though. They help with setting up the game.

One of B's favorite games from his middle school game club, although this is probably not the right version (he plays One Night Ultimate?).

Once you've heard of 'The Resistance' you will never want to play this game again... EVER!
Once you're out of the game (which could be almost immediatly if you're unlucky), it becomes the most boring experience ever. It all boils down to:  'who has the biggest mouth?'. If you are that person, you will die quickly (resulting in being eliminated => boring). So, what you need to do is to remain as underdog as possible, aka saying nothing and not participating => boring.
So whether dead or alive, you will not enjoy this game. Ok my bad; you will enjoy this game... until you learn about 'The Resistance' (solving all problems The werewolves have).

The game is fun with the right group of people. Important to have a good narrator. This particular addition annoys me a bit as the abilities of the characters aren't described on the cards. This causes a lot of confusion. The game is cool but I would recommend one of the newer additions than this one. Great camping game. Even works with people who have had a few beverages as well, as long as the narrator is on point. Cool game.

Werewolves does really well at parties and supports a large group of players with no barriers to entry, people with little to no gaming experience can be part of this light role-playing experience. There's just one major drawback and that's player elimination which happens every turn in the game, meaning that some players might need to wait for almost an hour before they can be part of the game again. Hence, I recommend The Resistance (De Mol in the Nederlands) over Werewolves these days.

This game is a BLAST with the right group. We have a really great group of gamers and we are all friends and very strategic, so there are so many dimensions to this game when we play. It's about 50/50 for who wins - werewolves or townspeople - unlike Resistance, where the spies pretty much always win. The extra characters make it even more fun, especially the peeking little girl. The werewolves have to be that much more careful about choosing -- just a great game all around!

Una sorpresa de juego, cómo en tan poca caja caben tan buienos momentos!. Juego de asignación de roles a cada jugador y dedución para saber quién es quién.Varios hombres lobo atacan de noche a los ciudadanos de un pueblo y se mezclan con ellos durante el dia tratando de pasar desapercibidos.  Un jugadohace de cuentacuentos y crea la atmosfera para que la partida se desarrole sin trampas. 
Este juego lo enseñe a mis cuñadas y sus amigos y ha sido el triunfo sobre el carcassonne... solo por eso le debo la vida. Ha habido, desde el primer día, partidas temáticas, partidas chorronas, regals caseras, disfraces y un sin fin de partidas en las que han ganado cualquiera... pero casi siempre con risas y emoción... Se lo han pasado chachi.

I discovered this game here, on BGG in 2003. Absolutely great party game, specially on picnics or camping trips. You just need the attention of a lot of players with a minimum of discipline (so they won't cheat or mess up). This game will hook many people - THE party game! It's flaw is that it has player elimination... but just watching is a good laught too.

I really dislike devoting time to a party game during our 16-hour boardgame marathons.  Keep in mind that I would rather play a strategy game when I'm surrounded by like-minded gamers.  

The funny thing is that when I am among non-gamers I actually love spending time playing Werewolf/Mafia.  The truth is that I appreciate this game more so than I have led gamers to believe.  Werewolf is probably my favorite party game.  However, this does not mean that I want someone to suggest this game again at the next marathon!

Comment: Werevolves won't win if number of (intelligent, adult) players is less than 12.

13/07/07: Gespeeld in Studiekring Etterbeek; eigenlijk een beetje saai, want discussie komt niet goed op gang.

17/08/07: in Speelduivel en Den Amedee: met Xtof en Sonia, Alex, Kenneth, Jan, ... Met volwassen mensen die het spel kennen, is het al veel beter.  Conclusie: Als je met minder dan 12 deelnemers bent en ieder speelt intelligent, kunnen de wolven nooit winnen.

Awesome version that is worth the small price. The artwork has a neat Native American patchwork style to it, and fits well with the theme. I hesitate to bring some of the different special power cards into the game because there is no text, making the game prone to the "what do I do if I'm the hunter?" awkwardness. Nonetheless, a great cheap implementation that beats dots on notecards.

I can not mention enough how much worse this version of werewolf is to Ted Alspach's Ultimate Werewolf. The cards do not have text on them, and are sometimes confusing to interpret. "What role is this?" "What does the seer do again?"

In addition, the cards are square shaped and thus do not fit into card sleeves. If you're going to purchase a game that you could essentially play with a normal 52 card deck, go for Ultimate Werewolf over this. This isn't unplayable, but it's certainly not as good.

Simply an amazing game to play with a group of friends.  We usually aim for 12+ people at our parties before breaking this out.  With smaller groups the games go too quickly and aren't nearly as entertaining.

edit:  After losing our copy of the game we ordered the 2012 Special Edition.  The cards are much sturdier and come with multiple special roles.  The best part, though, is something as simple as turning the Sheriff's Badge into a necklace for the sheriff to wear.

I've played this more than anything else in my collection, without a doubt. Do you absolutely need to pay $12 in order to play Werewolf? No, but this is a nice deck of cards none-the-less, and I certainly don't regret the purchase.
That said, if you like Werewolf you'd be better off splurging on Ultimate Werewolf. It's twice the price, but it's got 10x the game.

My group has really taken to this game. We play it at least once at every game night, and we've played it a few times randomly at other events when we have a large enough group of willing participants. It's a lot of fun and works well if you have a good narrator. The rules for the characters are easy to understand, but make sure everyone knows what they're supposed to do and when before starting...one person who forgets can mess things up quite a bit!

Un clasico para jugar en grupo. Juego muy relajado y sencillo. Se reparten cartas.. una a cada jugador. Según el número de jugadores puede haber uno o más hombres lobo y los demás son campesinos. Por la noche todos cierran los ojos, y el lobo ataca y mata un campesino, a la mañana abren los ojos y hay que deducir quien es el lobo... debatiendo entre todos los supervivientes. Muy entretenido. Hay una expansión que introduce nuevos personajes. No la he jugado.

A commonly known social deduction game for larger groups. The main problem with the game is that one person dies (is eaten by the werewolves) in the first night. Thus, a player (that may be the one who really wanted to play) may be excluded from the get-go (which is really frustrating!).

I prefer "Resistance" or "One Night Ultimate Werewolf" for that reason.

Nice party and large group game, but IMHO they should have printed some of the role-specific rules onto the role cards, so every player knows what the rules regarding his role are. Currently we find it just a bit difficult when you play in a large group and have to explain all the different roles to everyone multiple times.

Werwolf is a great party game which appeals to gamers and non-gamers alike. It can be daunting to be a werewolf for people who aren't comfortable lying, but it usually works out well with all kinds of people. It's interesting to see how different a round plays out with shy werewolves or daring werewolves.

With the different roles it's possible to bring extra information into the game, so that the players don't have to rely completely on reading faces. That's important for groups that know each other well and have learned to keep a poker face and not to say anything suspicious.

The biggest downside is that there is player elimination, starting right in the first round. The problem is worse in larger groups (and the game is in general more fun with larger groups) as the dead people have to wait longer (and be quiet) until they can participate again.

Some say The Resistance makes Werewolf obsolete, because it doesn't have player elimination, but I don't agree at all. They are similar games, but provide a different experience. Also they work for different player counts, so they compliment each other well. With 10 or less players: play The Resistance; with more than that: Werewolf.

I guess my problem with this game is that there's no real or factual basis upon which a round is based.  Players just start accusing each other for entirely imagined and dumb reasons. 

It would be a much better game if there was some sort of information that players began with that helped piece together who the werewolves were.

The problem imo with werewolves is that there is no real way of knowing who is what and it is all just pure bluffing. I do like bluffing but I need some external input otherwise it is all just cheap talk.

Werewolf/Mafia is my all-time favorite party game.  I've been playing it since college, sometime in the late 90s.  The Resistance is a bit easier to get a game going, but if we have like 14 or 15 people at a party, this game is the best.  This set is not as good as Ultimate Werewolf, mainly because the cards lack English text and everyone ends up forgetting their role.

RATING: 8.5
Everyone will laugh at you when you explain how this game works: "close your eyes and it is night" etc. After just one play, it is very likely everyone will be sucked right into the game and those who laughed loudest tend to become the most enthusiastic.

If you can get enough players together, this game is simply awesome. I always take it when I go to a party that I know is small enough or where people who would like this kind of game come and tend to stay longest. The box size certainly allows for this.

My only complaint is: once you know the rules and the components of this game, you could make a version of it yourself. This means some people may find it nonsensical to spend any amount of money on it.

This is a social deduction game in its very sense. It's social and plays well with big groups, it's deductive (10% logic, 40% yelling and accusing, 50% psychology and gut feeling), and, most of all, it will turn gatherings into games that would normally just be gatherings with smalltalk, sipping drinks or dancing. I had many an enjoyable evening with it.
Biggest downside: Player elimination. If you're in a big group and get killed in the first night, better use your time to go to the bathroom, get a new drink, and have a spirited, long conversation with some non-gaming people for the next 30min or more.

All of my playings of this version are tracked under the regular Werewolf entry (which I consider a 10 for me).  I don't care for the Little Girl role (the one that can peek) since I think it really spoils the game. Otherwise, if you use the traditional roles, this is an attractive set of cards. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Werewolf is an exceptionally difficult game to rate. In many ways, it is more of a social role playing experience than it is a game of the type that I typically play, and it varies a lot based on whether it's played in-person, online, and if online, based on the theme of the game.

In person it's all about reading people's tells, knowing their play style and the like. Online, I think of it more as a pure role-playing experience. With the proper theme it can be exceptionally fun, though again, as a game per se, it's really more of an entertaining activity. Online games with really good themes (ala the Twin Peaks game that ran here) are something that I'm up for on special occasions; other incarnations of the game, not so much. This, despite the fact that I think the real life version functions much better as an actual game based on poker-style psychology and politics much better than the online game does.

As others have said, one of the main problems with this game is the early portion, where choices end up being arbitrary. After a few lynch votes and killings patterns can at least emerge, but it's hard to have much of a strategy before a handful of people have already been eliminated. In that sense, I think the online implementation is much better than real life, because it's something that you can just make occasional posts to and enjoy the role-playing element without having to invest the time in one large chunk.

The rating I give this is reflective of my general feelings about it as such. A good theme can sway me to play it, but I find in general it is too meta without enough actual meat until the game is already half over, and a lot of the early decisions, which can matter a lot, are arbitrary. The game, ironically, also suffers when people are too explicit about the meta, in other words, when they break role to discuss what is going on in the game, which makes perfect sense from a trying to win standpoint, but which doesn't fit the experience that well, at all.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Likes: It can play any number of players in a party setting.

Dislikes: The game really gets boring for those killed early. It isn't really for all personalities. Also, the initial accusations seem pretty arbitrary and it's essentially impossible to argue when you get accused. I'd much rather play The Resistance or even Bang!

A little too random compared to The Resistance, Bang!, and BSG.  Still, it has its place, and I love the dark theme.  Will have to try again next time I have 10+ people around looking for a game.  Sitting in silence for 30+ minutes can be a drag, though.

With my game group that I know WELL: 6.  I'll play, but begrudgingly.

At conventions: a ZERO.  This is NOT a game to play with strangers, much less tired (sometimes drunk) and CRANKY strangers.  This game at best is a mildly interesting blend of deduction and bluffing.  At WORST, it's a gigantic blamefest that can turn ugly and FAST.  And for what?  Based on who drew which card.

Sorry.  I know the following is huge.  I just don't get it.

Werewolf is a classic and rightfully so. It is not only one of the few games that I can try pretty much anywhere (as long as there are enough players) but also one of the best social experience games you can have. The success of this game depends a bit on the group in question but so far I've had nothing but successes.

This particular game has been eclipsed by Ultimate Werewolf: Deluxe Edition.

It heavily relies on the quality of the gamemaster and on the crowd involved. In particular, if the players are two much unbalanced in terms of "loud speakers" and "quiet people", the former tend to be killed first, while the latter make the game boring. In the end, I don't enjoy it too much as the game relies too heavily on external factors to be enjoyable.

I find that you need a minimum of 6 players including the story teller to play a decent, short game of Werewolf. Ideal to learn the game and the characters. A group of 8 players or more + the story teller would be a better experience of Werewolf. Not for everybody.

Two main characters in the the game, Werewolves and regular towns people. You got a few towns people with certain abilities which can effect the game play for an extra twist.

Recently played with cupid and the witch for the first time. They have become my two favorite characters in the game. I might look into getting the expansion.

Played now with all characters and game is very enjoyable and fun with the right crowd. Wouldn't say no to playing Werewolves with the right people.

This is a great game to play with a large group of people.  It's fun even when you've been eliminated to see how the rest of the game plays out.  It's good regardless of whether the people playing are gamers or not.  Best of all, you don't even need to purchase this game, you can just use cue cards and write down the roles without purchasing the game.  So I guess the cost versus aesthetics/functionality is a questionable matter with the game.  See comments on Ultimate Werewolves.

Buen juego donde recreamos una serie de asesinatos por parte de unos hombres lobos y unos linchamientos posteriores en busca de los posibles culpables.
El juego depende mucho de la gente que participe en Ã©l.
se necesita ser mucha gente, pero es un gran juego para veladas multitudinarias.
Para ganar casi siempre es bueno pasar desapercibido.
PARTIDAS:
05-04-2008 8 jugadores(Richi, Olga, Chuchi, Peto, Pi, Gato, Charlie "salinas", Iuliano). Yo (gato) voy de moderador y el azar marca que Iuliano y Olga sean los lobos y Pi la vidente.Los lobos matan a Charlie y Pi como vidente descubre a Olga, en el posterior linchamiento cae Chuchi.Con lo cual el juego termina con victoria de los lobos.Aunque el juego dice que pueden jugar 8, yo creo que el mÃ­nimo nÃºmero de jugadores es 9.

One of the most interesting experiences you can have with your fellow humans in any circumstances. You learn a lot about yourself and your friends. Be the moderator and watch how your friends lie; so fascinating. Taught to a party of med students once and one of them had just learned it in her psychiatry rotation. They know.

Everybody has or will eventually play this; but party games are not a success for everyone...I am one of the apostates that finds no joy in this group game. Adding the crazy characters just confuses the players and makes the game unnecessarily complex.

Mafia, but almost everyone gets a cool role! I've always loved this game of reading people/bluffing, but it is completely dependent on the crowd. In some social groups, I'd much rather play something else. But I usually don't mind being the narrator then. 

I find the game most interesting when we've changed some roles (like where the little girl is a renegade werewolf instead of a peeping tom) and tweaked the balance a little bit so that the wolves have a little more fun.

Once, our group figured out how to play with only 6 without a narrator and that was the most fun we ever had with the game.

RATING: 8
Rétrospectivement, le succès du jeu se présente comme une évidence. Un peu comme celui du "Jungle Speed". Pourtant ce n'était pas gagné et, comme souvent, "il fallait y penser". La réussite commerciale des "Loups-Garous de Thiercelieux" est un grand bol d'air dans l'univers ludique très grand public qui s'est approprié le suscité "Jungle Speed". Par ce que "Catane", même s'il a posé une pierre à l'édifice du monde ludique, n'a, en France du moins, pas vraiment le même succès et sort nettement moins facilement auprès d'un public pour qui jeu de société rime encore uniquement avec "Monopoly" ou "Cluedo".

Et là, en début de siècle (même s'il met quelques années à réellement percer), déboule ce jeu qui propose une version miniature et très light du jeu de rôle où chacun joue un personnage secret et doit entrer dans un background, argumenter et user de ses talents vocaux pour convaincre ses partenaires, user de diplomatie, de déduction, de tact, de coopération... Bref, plein de paramètres à prendre en compte et qui seront plus ou moins présents selon les joueurs autour de la table. Ou assis sur l'herbe, ou sur le tapis, ou dans la cour de récré. Parce qu'un des avantages du jeu, c'est sa transportabilité, on peut y jouer partout et il prend peu de place. Un autre avantage, c'est que malgré toutes les ressources mises en place par le jeu, il se joue rapidement. Les petits plus apportés par les personnages spéciaux sont agréables mais ne changent pas la dynamique principale, ajoutant uniquement un peu plus de variété. Les extensions, je ne les ai jamais essayées, et je doute qu'elles soient nécessaires pour renouveler un jeu qui change à chaque partie.

Oui, il a des défauts, c'est la raison pour laquelle je ne lui accorde pas la note maximale que, sur le plan théorique, il mériterait. D'abord, bien sûr, il y a la question du pourquoi dépenser des sous pour un jeu qui peut se jouer avec des bouts de papier ? Réponse qui transforme la limite en atout : d'une part, on l'achète pour les règles (des personnages annexes notamment), d'autre part c'est tout le talent d'un jeu qui arrive à "institutionnaliser" des mécanismes aussi simples et auxquels tout le monde aurait pu penser, mais ne l'a pas fait. Et puis c'est toujours plus agréable d'avoir les vraies cartes en main, les illustrations sont relativement agréables, dans un univers ben particulier, même si ce n'est pas vraiment ce qui fait l'intérêt du jeu. Et puis c'est pas cher, aussi.

Ensuite, il faut trouver huit joueurs motivés. Là, ça peut se compliquer, d'autant que le plaisir de jouer dépend fortement d'une part du talent de conteur du Maître du Jeu, mais aussi et sans doute encore plus des joueurs présents. C'est sans doute le problème le plus flagrant du jeu. Quand on se retrouve avec des gens qui soit se prennent trop au sérieux, soit pas du tout et font n'importe quoi sans rentrer dans le truc, le jeu perd beaucoup en saveur : aucune argumentation (qu'elle soit ou non sérieuse), aucune stratégie, aucune discussion, un simple vote à main levée, l'ennui se fait vite sentir... tout comme quand le conteur essaie d'instaurer une certaine ambiance et que les joueurs l'en empêchent (situation vécue). Mais une fois qu'on a trouvé les huit (si possible bons) joueurs, il faut reconnaître que le jeu a cet avantage d'être jouable à beaucoup et de réunir en mettant une bonne ambiance, ce qui n'est pas forcément le cas d'autres jeux tout aussi bons mais plus limités en nombre de joueurs. Le jeu de société répond donc dans ce cas tout à fait à sa fonction de créateur de lien social et de partage.

Un très bon jeu qui a permis d'ouvrir le grand public à quelque chose d'assez nouveau. Le fait qu'il ai eu tant de succès est réellement réjouissant et porteur d'espoir, il n'y a pas un rejet absolu de la nouveauté ludique en France, il faut juste lui laisser le temps de trouver son public. Et s'il ne le trouve pas, cessons de dramatiser, nous on joue et on s'amuse, c'est peut-être le principal.

There are several things I don't like with this game:

- The first player is eliminated from the game very early, usually without any fault on her/his side

- depending on the roles involved half of your decisions have no logical basis at all - just pure guessing

- If you, as a villager, want to play this game and participiate in the discussions it is often the best way to get killed the next night - werwolves don't like people who can influence others and show some competence in identifying werewolves! So in the end there are mainly the players left who are less active or less competent - shouldn't it be the other way?

Popular game that is hampered by a harsh player-elimination mechanism. Don't let individual games run too long! If you have to choose between this and The Resistance, choose The Resistance: same experience but without this issues.

Most of the time it's a great discussion who are the bad guys (I'M NOT, I'M NOT!) no matter what role you have, although the role of the simple villager can in a few cases be depressing if werewolves play very good and your fellow villagers don't believe you.
The only bad thing about this game is the wait time for another game for the players who left in the first two rounds.

Like Mafia in a box. I don't think I've had a big enough group to really enjoy this; at the minimum of 8 players, you pretty much get one round to catch a werewolf before they win the game. That and my group tended to just kill the person perceived as "best" at gaming, meaning the same one or two people always died in the first round every time. 

Does let you repeatedly utter the phrase "lycanthropic needs."

My number 1 favorite party game. A lot of people agree with me on this one. I don't know of anyone who has tried Werewolrves of Miller's Hollow (from hardcore to non-gamers) and has not liked it. Easy to laern, easy to play. Only problem is that you need a minimum of 7 players. As such, it only comes out once in a while.

Amazingly, the people with whom I played this game for the first time did not even get these simple rules correct! They played that the Seer on the first night gets to know the identity of all the Werewolves. The moderator just points out all the Werewolves on the very first night.

I tried to explain to no avail how this would completely break the game (having played the public domain version many times). But no, they insisted that's how the Seer works. Fortunately, the Werewolves got lucky and knocked off the Seer the first night, so the game actually had a chance.

I LOVE playing this game with a big group of my students (5th grade). They are so good at getting worked up. It's particularly fun when a few of them get into the role-playing aspect.

So far we've only played this with pre-teens and the shouting and arbitrary finger pointing for childish reasons or lack thereof bugged me.  I want to play this with a more mature group that wants to put thought into it and use real deduction.

UPDATE:  I never want to play this because I dislike having to be the moderator.  I also dislike player elimination.  I'm interested in The Resistance Avalon.  

UPDATE: The Resistance Avalon replaces this by 1000%.

My preferred comercial Werewolf deck. The cards are easy to see at a distance (which facilitates the initial game explanation), are easy to remember, and can be distinguished in poor light. It has a good selection of special roles, but I don't like the Little Girl or Theif because they short-circuit many games. I re-purpose those cards as Masons and/or a sorcerer.

There is not much of a game but on the other hand there are not many games for large groups, which is a bonus for werewolves. If funny or not also depends on the group's mood and talk "who's done it?". But then it happens all the time that unguilty persons are killed by the villagers and they et angry about themselves. I don't like games where the temper rises. Games should be fun, not frustrating. Furthermore the cards design is awful and not in the least explaining the character one plays.

Interesting game where some players are villagers and some are werewolves. It's one of the games that can take the biggest number of players I've seen so far. However, there are some things which I don't like. Player elimination can be boring when you're an early target, the need for a narrator means someone won't even play and the first rounds have you take someone out in a random way, without any reasons. 
However, a great narrator can turn it around and make the session fun and memorable!

If you like this game try "The Resistance", which fixed all of these problems.

The game can be enjoyable with the "right" type of players, and a smaller ranther than larger group, else the debates become endless.  Game Master must be strick on time and force a "vote" after the time is up.

This was a fun enough social game.  Definitely can bog down in the early stages with a lot of people.  And it's very unclear as to what is legitimate to do in the game to determine who is evil and who isn't.  Are you ok with listening for noise when the werewolves are supposed to be about?  It's a decent past time, and a very interesting psychological game.

Fired/Replaced by Resistance. Since I have Resistance, I have never played Werewolve again. It's still a fun group activity, especially if the game master changes the story.

Try some of these scenarios:
- Elderly people at the nursing home with the dreaded "wheelchair gang" that runs over their victims
- Boy scout camp with the bullies who steal your lunch money.
- Your-Country's Next Top Model with the ambitous models poking lipstick in their victims' eye sockets.
- The office with the mobbers who staple their victims to death.

When I am bored I like to think of new fun scenarios. It's always great when the group gets into their roles and leaves the typical taxonomy of "werewolves vs. citizens" behind.

Party game that is not bad at all.  But: it is long, you can be easily eliminated at the beginning, you need a lot of people (>8) and players should have proper qualities/attitude to have fun and not to spoil it for others.
So many conditions (and so little time) make me not to want to play this often..

Played Polish version ('Mafia' by Granna).

Great for a lesson about mob rule. Otherwise, the social interaction is all you're really hoping for in this game. 

By the way, I won my first game when I was the werewolf (we were eight or nine)... So, this opinion is not coming from a sore loser of which this game will definitely produce! Yes, consider that a warning: do not play this game with whiny people. They will suffer and so will anyone in earshot.

Initial Rating: 8.5 (September 2010)

The first time I played Werewolf was with this version of the game. I just love werewolf, it is a great party game. I know it has its issues like player elimination, but the game is usually fast so it is not an issue for me.  The roles make the game even better. Every time we play Werewolf we laugh a lot. This is a game I truly enjoy and thus the high rating, besides I love secret role games.

It’s been years since I last played this version of the game. Besides, I have changed a lot during this time. I still have fond memories of the game and I still love secret identities games, but now, my desire to play Werewolf (in any version) is very low. There are much better alternatives in the market right now (The Resistance, Deception) so I’m decreasing its rating to one that matches my feelings for the game with BGG´s rating system.

I sold all the werewolf games I had.

Yeah, it has a cool werewolf theme and people really seem to love this game. However, I just can't get into the whole theme of lying to people while passionately insisting that you're telling the truth. It seems like more stress to me than it's worth and I just don't see the fun in it.

RATING: 7
Oooh, boy is this good with the right crowd. It's about influencing and deduction, as the innocent villagers try to uncover the werewolves in their midst before they become the wolves' midnight snacks. A few caveats: there's not much game, so analysts looking for complex mechanisms, optimum strategies and the like tend to be put off. Also, with too many introverts playing it can be a non-event as it's more about social interaction than anything else. Finally, people do get knocked out (it's not called werewolves for nothing!), but it's a very quick game and it's still fun to watch the interaction and confusion from the sidelines, indeed as it is if you're the moderator running it. You could make your own set from a few bits of paper if you really wanted (it's essentially a few cards and the rules), but it's cheap and I really like the card art on the Asmodee edition. Needs a big crowd.

Update July 2010: beginning to think I've played this enough now, but still can't think of a better game for 10+ players.

Without the usual party trappings... it still has all of the feel of a "Party Game!"  As such, it immediately gets a drop in rating.

Played once at our Club and went over like the proverbial lead balloon... it just wasn't a lot of fun.  I doubt that we'll ever play again.

With the right group or after a few beers, it might be OK.  But for now it only rates a '4'.

RATING: 7.5
Unfortunately the metagame is way too high here. People tend to kill players based on their experience with the game or just a previous game. Analytical people often get killed in the first night... this makes the game hard to love for me. Too many games end in who's best at yelling instead of diplomatics/lying, because the good players are killed or are werewolves.
Still quite enjoy it to introduce this to new groups and facilitate the storytelling part.
EDIT: New insights and houserules have revived this game for me. Play with advanced players without talking or looking for an awesome experience. Players who go out in the first round get two rounds of day/night immunity in the next game.
I'm even working on an agile transformation-flavoured version of this game which I will open source.

Great to bring to conferences.

RATING: 5
Luckily this is cheap, as you could easily play this game for free without purchasing these cards.  But not being a veteran Werewolf player, I was not aware of all these different roles, which can be kind of fun.

You definitely have to have the right group for this.  I use it occasionally in my French class, as it promotes conversation.  I also really like false accusations and the response they usually provoke.

Update: As we've played this more, we've had a lot of fun with it.  With the right group of people, the deceit and confusion is hilarious.

Update 2014: Can't believe I haven't come back to this to downgrade its rating. The way the cards use icons/patterns rather than words is unnerving, and the Little Girl role is completely broken. There is absolutely no reason to purchase this over Ultimate Werewolf, except for the fact that the UW artwork isn't very attractive.

Fun deduction and bluffing party game. I would consider this kind of games as not really my cup of tea, but, to my own surprise, I hugely enjoyed a set of plays in November 2008. With the right company at the right time, this becomes an excellent experience. By the way, being a werewolf is not easy. Learned in the session on Easter 2010: avoid making noises when playing as werewolf (I am apparently extremely silent when "asleep" and make unintentional noises when awake as werewolf, giving it away way too easy) or alternatively, start making noises whenever a character is called during the night for its special abilities. **** 8 of the recorded plays as moderator.

Ok, I admit Werewolves has been a gateway games for many people. However, once you've played a dozen games, you realize how many flaws it has. 

First player elimination is a big no-no for introducing players. Even worse with lot of people. How many times peoples eliminated early ended up playing another game together and actually having fun ?

Second, the first few turns are completely automatic (vote for the mayor, kill the mayor, etc...) because there is no actual information. The discussion is only making the game longer, but it's totally meaningless.

Third, regardless of actual roles the people that talk are the extrovert, and the people that talk are the introvert. If people are uncomfortable speaking in public, Werewolves is not gonna help them. They will just stay silent as much as they can until they get branded as a Werewolf and can't defend themselves.

Finally, The Resistance is now a much better game, fixing all theses problems. No player elimination, actual information about what is happening so the discussion is actually meaningful, and the people who get engaged in missions will be engaged in the discussion much more easily.

Werewolves of Miller's Hollow is a game that takes place in a small village which is haunted by werewolves. Each player is secretly assigned a role - Werewolf, Villager, or special character such as The Captain, The Hunter, the Witch, the Little Girl, The Seer and so on... There is also a Moderator player who controls the flow of the game. The game alternates between night and day phases. At night, the Werewolves secretly choose a Villager to kill. During the day, the Villager who was killed is revealed and is out of the game. The remaining Villagers (normal and special villagers alike) then vote on the player they suspect is a Werewolf helped (or hindered) by the clues the special characters add to the general deliberation. That player reveals his/her role and is out of the game. Werewolf is a social game that requires no equipment to play, and can accommodate almost any large group of players.

The integration and even strong focus on player elemination plus the absolute requirement for a game moderator makes me really dislike this game, especially in comparison to other similar but better games.

Depending on the number of players, one game can go on for 30-120 minutes (or even longer), and players who are eleminated (which happens every 5-10 minutes) can by then just sit out and watch the rest of game or even play something entirely different.

Why play this game, when you could play [b][thing=128882][/thing][/b] instead ?

The concept is quite good. What I find rather annoying is that the people that are killed are simply out of the game and they have to wait another 30 mins til they are involved in a new round, not allowed to say a word. The new adaption "One night werewolf" is much better or you are going for "The Resistance".

Game itself is simple enough but requires a modicum of discipline, which makes it hard to implement at family reunions or office parties.  In theory, an interesting concept with vast potential, in practice, very hard to actually make happen.  Maybe in a classroom with a group of students?  This being said, I'm not sure you need to buy this at all.  The content of the box being a rulebook and a deck of cards (which you can easily improvise).  Just find the rules online and you are set.  If you like this, look into "The Resistance" which is simply better.

RATING: 6
it's not my favorite kind of games but it pretty inovative and it can be played mith many people who does not necessarilly need a gaming experience. The only problem so far is that many of the specials abilites are either never used, some are not convenient to use and some are useless in our games. For example, we never count the vote accurately, so the captain role is somewhat useless. The thief is also never used because it can change the ratio of werewolf/peasants

April 2009.

My favorite role/card to be added to the base Werewolf game is:  The Cursed.  The Cursed is a villager who starts the game as a normal villager, but if the werewolves chooses or feeds on The Cursed, this villager becomes another werewolf.  I like games where The Cursed is added along with The Hunter but take out The Witch (b/c the healing potion just makes it a little too difficult for the werewolves to win.)

Its not a broken game; I just hate this game more than most any other!  Every time I've played this game I've been one of the first ones to die leaving me with nothing to do while everyone else spins their yarns.  No more, never again, I will not play this again.  I normally don't mind elimination games but this one I do not care for in the least.

A very fun social game, this Werewolf variant has the basic roles and is suitable for up to 18 players, making it a good party game. Progress is tracked by who's still in, and movement is limited (only the narrator really has to move), so it makes a good game for the tour bus. Requires a good narrator for best effect.

Werewolves, the main fear of most people.  The best part of this game is it's type of "guess who" and "bite and run" style of gaming.  Funniest part though is the unpredictability and persecution.

Not fun. It's supposed to be, but it isn't. It's OK with a group of friends, if you're drinking, but it's terrible with strangers.  
There really isn't a game here, as it's just blind accusations based on nothing and shouting other people down. Anyone who speaks up gets lynched, so the best strategy is to sit in silence, which makes for a dull game.

How anyone succeeded in making such a interesting game by giving every player only 1 card at the beginning of the game, is amazing. This game is THE game to play if you want to give a big group of people an unforgetable evening around the camp fire.

Why I don't like this game? Because I hate games that make me pretend and lie. And when you are the werewolf, you don't have any other option.

Played it with some nongamers/social gamers and they loved it.  It was a group of only 8 though, 7 playing and a moderator, so I can see this being more fun with more people.

Even more than the usual suspects, this is the gateway game as far as I'm concerned, the one I found that opens people's eyes to the fact that great games dripping with smartness have been published after Risk. (Technically, Werewolf exists since Noah's Ark, I know, but it would have stayed pretty underground (underwater?) without this edition.)

So, this is the ultimate party game for large parties, as fun whether you are the game master, werewolf, villager or special role, except if you are killed on the first night. But even then, watching the others play knowing who is who is thrilling, and a game is achieved so quickly that you will have a better time the next one. The killer feature : people of any kind will enjoy it : shy or extrovert, bad lyer or natural born bullshitter...

Although it is quite difficult for us these days to find more than 8 people to play this game, it always gives us such a thrill that it merits a place in our top 25. After a game (or most likely a couple of games) have ended, the discussions keep on coming: how mean were these werewolves again! And it always feels bad to be stabbed in the back. And if you are silent, you get hung and if you talk too much, you get hung too!

Every sound, every word is weighted... one step besides the track is likely to be punished by being killed by the 'innocent' village people. Not for the faint of heart!

Update: I like Avalon better now as it removes some disadvantages of Werewolves: no player elimination, already playable with 5 players and no storyteller

Might leave the collection as a lot of our friends alreay own it and we never pull our copy out.

I imagine most of you have played this one. Well, we hosted a game night a few weeks ago and had 12 people show up and two or three different games were being played at any one time.

After the dinner break this little gem was suggested and it was great to have one game that we all could enjoy together.

It's a pretty simple game with a lot of room for different playing styles and personalities. The basic idea is that the 'werwolves' must be identified and liquidated before the village is destroyed. One villager is eaten each night and another is lynched as a werewolf each day. This continues until either all wolves have been killed or the village is destroyed.

The game was 'made' by the moderator who really ran an excellent game (thanks, John!).

A great option for a large group with enough special characters to keep it varied.

Not sure why I was always a 'lover' (and always with another male) but I guess people think I have an expansive heart.

Der Klassiker unter den "Wer ist der Werwolf"-Spielen!
Was braucht man für eine perfekte Runde Werwölfe von Düsterwald: 
1. Eine große Runde - je größer desto Besser. 8 Spieler sollten es schon sein.
2. Einen fähigen Spielleiter, der es schafft Atmosphäre zu erzeugen und das Spiel an den richtigen Stellen zu lenken.
3. Spieler die gerne miteinander reden und interagieren.
DANN ist das Spiel ein riesiger Spaß! Fehlt eine dieser oben genannten Zutaten, kann das Spiel auch schnell anstrengend und lahm werden.

So many good nights with so many good friends. A game I could never forget for all of this.

Don't play it too quickly. Give time to the master to tell you what happen, and slowly, create a mood you can only enjoy.

A game to play during summer nights, with a candle by player and you stop the candle when a player die leaving only alive players be seen by other players.

[b]Like:[/b]
-Being able to play with a ton of people on the couch and such
-Many people know this game
-Making someone believe your lie

[b]Dislike:[/b]
-Player elimination
-Having to choose for a player to die (however this also adds to the deduction)
-The need for a narrator

The One Night version blows this one out of the park. More people know and have this version though so that's an advantage it has. Also, the build up of each night can be quite cool. The fact you can literally play this on the couch and with more people is a big advantage.

The negatives: someone has to be out of the game every night, and possibly even worse, that player's got to be chosen by others (although that does have the interesting advantage of finding out who would kill that guy). I can forgive player elimination a bit here since it's always a spectacle to watch when you know for sure who's lying. Also, someone has to play as a moderator, and a bad moderator can ruin the game (yes, it is possible to be a bad moderator).

RATING: 6
This is one of those games that I find fascinating to watch, but cannot for the life of me *play well*, which contributes to the rating.  Few things are more enjoyable than watching a skilled Werewolf spin a web of spurious logic when confronted by a Seer or suspicious villagers.  Unfortunately, my own escapades as a wolf tend to be rather short, as when I am accused I tend to flail about lamely when attempting to defend myself (actually, come to think of it I do that when I'm a villager, too -- but at least that doesn't require much in the way of mendacity :-)

This or any game of the Mafia/Werewolf-family is THE party game or game for bigger (I'd say 8+) groups of people.
I introduced this to my kids at school (a democratic school) and they totally loved to play this for years... wherever possible.
Can be played with self-made cards/tokens or a simple deck of playing cards. But this edition is very beautiful and adds some nice atmosphere.

Viele Jahre lang war Werwolf für mich das beste Großgruppen-Spiel. Seit ich jedoch [b]Der Widerstand[/b] kenne, kann ich es nicht mehr verantworten, ein Spiel vorzuschlagen, bei dem 20% der Leute doch nicht mitspielen können, nur weil sie bereits in der ersten Nacht gestorben sind.

[u]Spiele, die die Makel von Werwolf beheben:[/u]
• [b]Der Widerstand[/b]
Wie Werwolf - nur ohne Moderator, ohne dass Leute ausscheiden und mit besseren Indizien. Die naheliegenste Alternative; allerdings nur bis maximal zehn Personen.
• [b]Two Rooms and a Boom[/b]
Das beste Bluff- und Großgruppenspiel, welches auch mit 30 Leuten noch funktioniert und jedem Mitspieler eine Aufgabe bietet.
• [b]Werwölfe: Vollmondnacht[/b]
Die schnelle Variante von Werwolf. Für den kurzen Bluff zwischendurch.
• [b]Secret Hitler[/b]
Eine neues Spiel, das zwar das Rad nicht neu erfindet, angeblich aber Der Widerstand obsolet macht.
• [b]Mascarade[/b]
Ein Bluffspiel mit hohem Taktikanteil, welches auch noch mit 13 Leuten funktioniert. Hier tauscht man ständig seine Rollenkarte mit der eines Mitspielers - oder auch doch nicht. Dadurch entstehen interessante Verwirrungen.
• [b]Cat on yer Head[/b]
Ein Spiel für Menschenmassen - kann auch mit hunderten Leuten gleichzeitig gespielt werden.
• [b]The Game[/b]
Ein Hintergrundspiel für Hauspartys. Wer an das Spiel denkt, der hat verloren.

Dude, it's Werewolf.  You either enjoy it or you don't.  It's a role-playing experience more than a game.  And for large groups hanging out, I'd rather play Rock Band.  Or Pitchcar.

Also, the cards are fairly difficult to translate, especially the more esoteric roles.  They're supposed to be more evocative.  Got it.  They're more confusing.  I'm at the point (like most Werewolf players, I imaging) where it's just clearer to use a regular deck of cards.

Innovativo gioco di deduzione e bluff che ha riscosso molto successo e in seguito generato numerose imitazioni. Party game che, con la giusta compagnia, regala serate molto divertenti. Il gioco però ha alcuni punti critici come l'eliminazione anticipata dal gioco dei giocatori sacrificati, ad inizio partita spesso semplicemebte per simpatia. Il gioco ha il grande vantaggio di poter esser giocato anche in gruppi particolarmente grossi (fino a 24/30 giocatori a seconda delle versioni) con l'inserimento di personaggi con poteri speciali (è carino inserire i personaggi speciali anche in pochi). La versione senza moderatore permette di non escludere nessuno dal gioco ma è più complessa da gestire e alcuni personaggi non possono essere utilizzati.

Really fun with a large group. Used to play Mafia at camp but this is nice to formalize the rules that we used to play on the fly. I particularly like the variation of roles and how you can throw in different roles each game to mix things up. It always gets people talking for ages afterwards. 
It's a little shame that some people keep quiet. it's almost as though they're not playing the game correctly.

I'm new to this site, so I hope I'm posting my comments in the right place. I'm talking about the PC game Mafia by Illusion Softworks. I can only rave about it! I've been playing it nearly every day for more than two years. The setting is the city of Lost Heaven in the 1930s. It is essentially about the protagonist Tommy Angelo who began his career as a taxi driver during the Depression and eventually became a top soldier for Don Salieri and his Mafia Family. Briefly, the violence is of the "honorable" old-fashioned Mafia kind. There is no foul language except in one very small portion of one of the many modifications available for download. It also is quite funny! Shortly after I bought the game I joined Mafiascene.com. I am now an Elite Member with nearly 2,000 posts-that's how much I love the game and the web site. For me right now Mafia is absolutely the greatest. It is a veritable work of art. I highly recommend it for those who appreciate beauty, Mafia lore, and who have a keen sense of humor!

Funny game, great for larger groups. About the only party game that I'll play.

When I was on Jury service I played this with my group in the deliberation room.

The only problems with the game are the lack of information at the start, so it comes down to guessing. If the wolves are good, the final lynching will come down to guessing too. 'Dead' players have to sit and watch, but it's not a very long game.

3.5*

Ok, why the *?

Werewolf is a great, great game.  Maybe one of the best party games ever.

These cards suck.  How hard is it to put the role and a description on the card for newbies?  I don't like the art either.

Happily, I really paid nothing for these cards, as I needed $2 one day to get free shipping and picked this.  So I saved money buying these cards.

Either print your own (like I did) or buy another set, which I will likely do someday when I need a few dollars for free shipping again.

3.5 is about the lowest I can go, as I save broken games for 3 and under.

Square cards and pleasant (if sometimes confusingly abstract) art and design make this version of the classic game of truth divination a treat. Easy to teach, and very folksy feeling.

Way overrated.

Look at "Resistance" which has the same principle but is way better.

Biggest problem with this game:
-People who get killed early in the game will have a poor gaming experience.
-Not a lot of deduction possible, a lot of empty accusation.
-One player cannot play (has to "tell the story")
-Complex roles can add something for experienced players, but often it just makes the game messier and confuse people.

Now this is totally fun game. I've hosted this game a couple of times. And play as a normal villager a couple of times too. This is the kind of game where you would want to look for more people to join. And they'll ask for more. This is basically like the popular game Mafia. You can play up to 20 players in this game, a person to host the game. And you're done!

In this game, players will try to figure out who is the werewolves among the other player. And if he is one of the  werewolves, his mission is to blend in and make sure nobody suspects him. At night (All players close their eyes), werewolves will kill a villager. And at day, villager will vote on someone they think is a werewolf. This proses is repeated until all the werewolves are dead or the villagers are devoured by the werewolves.

What makes it more interesting is that some certain players will have special ability like The Fortune Teller, The Hunter, The Little Girl, The cupido etc. This game is a must try!

I really like the art style of Miller's Hollow, and it is the game that first introduced me to Werewolf, but Functionally speaking I have to go with the much uglier Ultimate Werewolf since the text on the cards makes teaching new roles to new players a breeze, while this is just annoyingly abstract. Better to frame this one than to play it.

Excellent party-style game, one in which everyone participates eagerly. No mimicking, no word-wizardy, no geeky knowledge required -- just a backstory anyone with a minimum of literacy (and I mean MINIMUM) can relate to. I have run sessions with groups as large as 16, mostly non-gamers, and it was a blast. It's one of those uniquely tuned game systems you must try out at least once.

Downgraded to a 6 due to The Resistance.

When I originally played Werewolves a few years back, I disliked it. After being arm-twisted into a couple of games, my dislike dissolved and solidified into something approaching love.

I greatly enjoyed the demagoguery aspect of the game; false and baseless accusations, Salem style interrogations, as well as the psychological aspect once you become familiar with your playing group's playing style. All the little clues, those 'give' signs when they are lying.

The fundamental problem with Werewolves, or any social deduction game is the group dynamic. Play with a truculent crowd and the game falls completely flat. An experienced moderator is essential to keep the flow of the game, and to call time on circular discussions. 

It is not uncommon for a new player to die in the first couple of rounds, and then spend the next 45 minutes completely outside of the game.

Once I played The Resistance it completely replaced Werewolves for me. That said, with the right crowd, I would still play Werewolves once in a blue moon.

Donated my copy to my former MeetUp Chinese Social group.

We played this at UCON 2012 last weekend.

Gave this an 8. Good game, under the right circumstances. Some ppl will not enjoy it, though personally I loved it to death.

These games, 'Are You A Traitor', 'Spies', 'The Resistance', and 'Werewolves' are all quite similar. Mechanics and rules vary. Each has its own unique flavor.

I did not know if Werewolves games would be for us- they are a strange mix of Apples-to-apples and clue (if clue had no rules or turns).

Turns out- we loved it. This was a very fun game, for us, though I think some of the more anti-social people there had a hard time jumping into it. They would get angry or frustrated and didnt seem to have a good time.

If you ever played Froggy Murderer as a kid, Werewolves is the grown-up version of that game.

We played with 20+ people and lots of custom rules and stuff. I thought this was just the most fun I had all weekend. Mindy like it too.

Great Ice-breaker! Because of this game we were able to get to know many strangers at the UCON by first name, and enough to kinda make buddies with them over the weekend. Without Werewolves, I am sure that would never have happened. 

The utility of the game at a Con aside, I think this was a very fun game. It was similar to the many games we played at college in our Study of Play class- it is definitely social and silly and meant for interaction purposes, not learning or strategy/competition.

It seemed that the more anti-social players and the overly-competitive ones had a bad time, while us chatty-kathys and game-lovers had a good time.

**NOTE**
You do not have to buy this game to play this game. The only requirements are 
1) an understanding of the basic rules
2) some scraps of paper

There is no game board, just these little cards that are for werewolves, villagers, and sometimes some other stuff.

Just saying, you don't really have to buy it, lol.

The basic game of Werewolf is probably a "10": a lovely, social game that makes a great evening with friends even better. Does it need these extra cards? No, but the cards can add some fun. I would never add all the extra ideas to one game but they (cupid, the hunter, the captain,etc..) are well thought out options. And if you have people who are tired of always being "just a villager"...here's some options.

Player elimination and a mandatory narrator detract from this classic (and improved) version of Mafia.
The characters are pretty cool, but the game just doesn't grab me, since no one has much control and no one really has a great reason to accuse someone or is able to find any worthwhile evidence to aid in self defence.  Usually people get upset.

This game can easily be played with a regular deck of cards but the art work on these cards is much more appealing. Also, the heavy-duty cards are great for playing with kids (I often play with groups in the elementary school I work in). I most like playing as the narrator yet, the game can even be fun once you've been killed off... Seeing who the werewolves are and watching the game unfold can be just as much fun as accusing, or being accused...

An old classic with many new roles. This game is only fun if the people you are playing with are willing to play any role and debate at the "day-time" phase. The game becomes rather complicated when there are over 10 players as you will need more than one narrator to oversee the game. The "Little Girl" role should be remade as it is quite powerful.

RATING: 6.5
If you love the social, murder mystery, "who-dun-it" type party games, Werewolves of Miller's Hollow is as good as it gets. You get the best of both worlds: the fun and intrigue of a "Mafia-esque" game with the haunting theme of a village under attack by a crafty band of werewolves.  

The game master sets the scene: a quaint little village, maybe early 19th century New England. The townsfolk are a simple people, concerned with the day-to-day operations of keeping up with their crops and farms. One afternoon, a group of school kids runs down to the stream just on the outskirts of town to catch frogs. Suddenly, a scream splits the still air as the children scamper up the hillside to the safety of their parents' embraces. They point trembling fingers at the woods by the stream while words like, "Dead!" and "Blood!" barely escape their quivering voices. The adults run down to the stream to find a villager lying propped against an old oak tree...torn open with open gashes covering his body from head to toe. What could have done this? Someone barely breathes the word, "Werewolf." The hunt is on! 

Now each player gets randomly assigned a role. The lowly villager is the most difficult as they have no special abilities to assist in their hunt. On their side, however, is the powerful seer who gets to peek at one player's role card during each night phase. The cunning witch also sides with the villagers whose powers allow her to revive or kill a player once per game. The skilled hunter can take a last dying shot at another player before his heart stops beating after a vicious werewolf attack. The sneaky little girl gets to peak at the conniving werewolves as they decide who their next unlucky victim will be. But beware! Each of these skilled villagers must not expose their true identities to the masses as they would become the werewolves' next meal! The waters are muddied further by a sly cupid who ties two hearts (and fates!) of his own choosing together in a Romeo and Juliet bond of love...in life and in death! Add many more characters and nuances with several expansions. 

The villagers win if they kill all the werewolves. The werewolves win if they kill all the villagers. The two lovers win if they both survive! Werewolves hunt at night, and the villagers lynch a suspected werewolf during the day. Prepare your best poker face and your most cunning persuasion skills to stand even a remote chance of survival!

If you have a large crowd, this is one of the best party games out there.  For this incarnation, I gave a slightly lower rating than the standard Werewolf just because I don't like playing with this deck.  For some reason, there is confusion (especially with the werewolf) for this deck.

Excellent version of the Werewolf game. Beautiful cards. The best addition in the rules is Cupidon and the Lovers : it adds a new layer of thinking and complexity, for seasoned players which know each other player in the game, it's an excellent addition.

RATING: 10
For spontaneous pick-up play during a convention with 15-20 total strangers, there is no better game experience than is provided in this little deck of cards. Hell - you don't even need the damn cards - a deck of ordinary playing cards or a little sack of glass stones would do just as well.

No - it's not a game to play in your ordinary game circle and it plays better if you don't know who you are playing with. If you tried this game with your friends - you won't be impressed.

But under the optimal conditions presented at a game convention - this is the highlight game of the convention - and it's not even close.

Party game with a twist. Expect lynch mobs torching your house. However, bear in mind that to have actually fun with this game, you need a good group that knows the difference between playing a game and having long-winded, fruitless discussions devoid of arguments during and pointless accussations after the game. Once in a while with a large group, this can be a treat, but most of the times, I'd prefer Saboteur.

Nice party game! Great if all your buddies turn up on your weekly gaming night and you don't like to split them into two groups. And you can perfectly mix gamers and non-gamers alike. Gamers will tend to play a deduction game. Non-gamers will have fun hanging the gamers and see them protest. Add in some roleplaying (start with the introduction round!!) and you'll be rolling on the floor laughing even when you were hanged in the first turn.

One tip: try to deal the werewolves to any women in your gaming group. Watch them set up all your competitive gaming buddies against each other. :)

The game is great.  Asmodee's version is a little wierd to me in that it includes the Little Girl, which is pretty much universally thought to be a broken role.  Other than that, it's werewolf cards.  However, I'm not a big fan of the artwork in this version.  But alot of people I know prefer it.

I do not get why this was split off from the main Werewolf Entry.  There isn't anything different about this game than the other one.  I guess Asmodee wanted to be different.

Have only ever played the "Mafia" version of this and came across "Werewolf" by chance. Used to play this game for hours at a time. It's very fun to play with a large group of people. I've heard some newcomers say they get intimidated and turned off by how much people can get into it.

I still recommend it as an ice breaker or for a group of familiars. Conversation and analysis after is often as entertaining as the games themselves.

This is excellent if the group is large enough. A good moderator is essential if your group is inexperienced. It can be hard to get players to open up a bit and start discussing, but it's great once people get into the flow. 

11 (excluding moderator) is a good number of players. Smaller groups are less fun. Only played with werewolves and seer combination, no other roles.

While I know a lot of people prefer One Night Ultimate Werewolf for its speed of play. I find that it tends to become a game of metagaming where the role cards matter for only a few seconds. In this version, your role continues to matter, and actually impacts the game, for far longer. It does take a lot of people, and it does take a bit more time, but I find it one of my absolute favorite hidden role party games.

I understand that if you have the right story teller and the right group it could be great, but I'm just as happy to watch, thank you very much.

This game can be great fun with the right (large) group of people.  Of course the player elimination leaves some people watching for most of the game, but a good portion of people I've played with enjoy seeing how things turn out.  I suppose eliminated players could  always start up another game.  I like the Miller's Hollow cards, since they are in color and have several options for additional characters.

I love playing it and moderating it. Downside is the big group you need to play this but it's always worth it. Player elimination is a hassle as well so you need to organize something around the game for them. Especially the first players, who just get picked at random because there's really no information available. If we play with a smaller group, I usually give the first few players to be eliminated another card, so they can actually play the game as well.

This game has one thing I don't like: player elimination. Not only this, as when playing in large groups (which will be the norm for this game to work), leaving early means watching the game more than actually playing.

Still, the damn thing works. Put a bunch of people in their leisure time, and laughs are bound to happen, this game just put a game in the middle.

[thing=25821][/thing] can be played with paper and pen, or a normal deck of cards. It has pretty simple rules. And will probably work for most people, specially for those that don't mind watching false accusations, straight lies, "hurt" feelings and much more that comes from the interaction between people in a social deduction game.

We've actually bought ID:177229 which is the special edition with the 5 characters from the expansion. This game is a a beautiful edition and the cards are just lovely. The artwork is intriguing and evocative, whilst the shape is really quirky and a nice detail. The rules for the different villager abilities could do with a cheat-sheet for the GM but we'll make one of those.
It's one of those games that makes you want to run out on the street, grab 30 random folk and say "Wanna try out a fun game about being a werewolf?" It just screams to be played.

RATING: 8.5
An "experience" game that is very group-dependent; with the right crowd, it's the best deduction game around.  There's just enough structure that you can start to make solid deductions about midway through the game.

Unfortunately, if you are killed before then, then the game just isn't that much fun, especially if there's a clique that won't kill each other until late in the game.  Best played at a con where there's lots of alternatives for the early victims to go play.

The game is best, imo, with a reasonable number of, but not too many, special powers in the game; first day no kill required; but every day after that, if the villagers don't lynch, then the wolves get two kills.

Probably the best game to play with 8 or more players (the more the merrier), but there is little competition in that area. What happens in the night is great, but the voting on which villager to execute can be tedious, and the first couple of rounds there is little to base your opinion on. It's a lot of guesswork at this stage. Would certainly play again, but only when asked.

I played the "free" version first and thought it fun however the graphical cards possible give less options of convincing others.  For example with a standard deck of card you can try to convince folks you have a particular card that isn't in play, but if someone has that card you could be identified.  Nonetheless these cards are colorful and fun as is the game.

A great large group game.  It is a lot of fun to play it as long as you can make sure the players stay focused.  You need to have a large group (over 6 players) for this game.

(Any plays of this I have are listed with the main Werewolf entry.)

Several of the roles available in this version tend to negatively impact the game overall; generally, the more "basic" the game (Wolves, Seer, Villagers), the more depth of strategy it actually has.

I really like this game, but it's only good with 8+ people.  When we have such a group, I'll always suggest it!  It's interesting, not as much challenge as some, but it's fun.  This is one of those games that is great for after holiday dinners.

8 - 18 players; 30 minutes; Werewolves of Miller's Hollow is a game that takes place in a small village which is haunted by werewolves. Each player is secretly assigned a role - Werewolf, Villager, or special character such as The Captain, The Hunter, the Witch, the Little Girl, The Seer and so on... There is also a Moderator player who controls the flow of the game. The game alternates between night and day phases. At night, the Werewolves secretly choose a Villager to kill. During the day, the Villager who was killed is revealed and is out of the game. The remaining Villagers (normal and special villagers alike) then vote on the player they suspect is a Werewolf helped (or hindered) by the clues the special characters add to the general deliberation. That player reveals his/her role and is out of the game. Werewolf is a social game that requires no equipment to play, and can accommodate almost any large group of players.The Werewolves of Miller's Hollow/les Loups-Garous de Thiercelieux/Die Werwölfe von Düsterwald is a published version arranged by Hervé Marly and Philippe des Pallières and published by Asmodée Editions, 2001 for 8-23 players. This has been nominated for the 2003 Spiel des Jahres award.Werewolves of Miller's Hollow is a separate game from Werewolf, and was split from that entry at the request of Asmodée Editions. Expansion: New Moon

►JOUEURS, NOMBRE(S) QUE JE RECOMMANDE:
# Nombres non-déterminés.

►COMMENTAIRE(S) ABRÉGÉ(S):
+ THÈME : assez présent; relativement bien intégré.
- Aide de jeu : non-inclus, j’aurais aimé qu’il y en ait au moins 1.
± Ambiance : est dépendante de l’implication des joueurs.
- Déroulement répétitif : peut donner l’impression que toutes les parties se ressemblent.
- Élimination : le(s) joueur(s) éliminé(s) en cours de partie pourrai(en)t devoir attendre longtemps la fin de celle-ci.
- Maître-de-jeu : nécessite un maître-de-jeu pour le déroulement de la partie.

►REMARQUE(S) PERSONNELLE(S):
* Un jeu auquel je ne désire plus rejouer depuis que j’ai essayé "One night ultimate werewolf".

Puisque ce jeu nécessite un maitre de jeu (non-joueur) pour faire la narration du déroulement de la partie, je me suis plus souvent qu’autrement retrouvée dans ce rôle afin que mes invités s’amusent. De plus, certains d’entre eux n’ont jamais été à l’aise dans le rôle du maître-de-jeu (oubli d’appeler un rôle, mauvaises directives lors du déroulement de la nuit, etc), ceci entraînant des erreurs "fatales" dans le déroulement de la partie. Finalement, plus il y a de joueurs plus il peut y avoir de rebondissements mais ce jeu comporte aussi un processus d’élimination graduelle qui fait en sorte que les premiers joueurs à être éliminés devront alors attendre assez longtemps avant de réintégrer la partie suivante (s’il y en a une).

We had a group of 9 so we played with 8   a moderator.  Everybody had fun and the game played very quickly, so the eliminated players didn't lose interest.  After 2 plays, we started to mix in some of the special cards which spiced it up a little, but didn't seem to have much impact on the play.  It wasn't until the fifth or sixth play that the townsfolk finally won, at which point we decided to move on to some meatier fare.

Yes, you don't need to buy anything to play Werewolf, but I picked this nice set of cards at sale.  On Christmas and new year's eve 2008, I introduced my extended family to this game, to amazing success.  We played until the wee hours of the morning..  

Aunque no se necesita comprar nada para jugar a Hombre Lobo, compré estas atractivas cartas en una venta.  En la navidad y fin de año 2008, jugué a éste juego con toda la familia, y el juego fue un éxito.  Jugamos hasta la madrugada.

The card art is wonderful (the primary reason that I purchased this edition of what's essentially a "common knowledge" game). However, the rulebook is filled with typos, misprints, and errors. I can't remember the last time I saw a rulebook that was this buggy. Luckily the game is so simple that the mistakes don't get in the way of comprehension.

Imprescindible para fiestas de gente, con chicos y chicas que quieran pasarlo bien jugando sin reglas complejas ni perder el tiempo en preparar tableros ni componentes, ni esperar turnos largos y pesados. Se juega con "posavasos" y al estilo polis y cacos. Nada más. No falla en las fiestas de tranqui con las chicas. ¡Querrán repetir! Risas aseguradas. Para toda la familia. Es típico echar varias partidas seguidas y no cansa.

This is an excellent game with the right group, especially with a theatrical storyteller taking the role of the narrator.

We tend to play this now with a version for the iphone, which takes the role of the narrator and adds atmospheric sound effects and a time limit. This makes the game playable with only four people.

The rules are very quickly picked up and even spontaniously formed groups can have a lot of fun together.
Being "killed" early is really not as worse as it may seem, as most players even have a good time watching the others accusing each other and voting for the next suspected werewolf... :-)
Quick games with 12 participants may be as short as 10 minutes, so it's easy to play multiple rounds.

Played in groups of 8, would be better with more players. Tough game of psychology, but the metagame has a tendency to creep in as well.
Works extremely well as an opener.
It can suffer from burnout as well, we played it 15 times in three game nights (5 times each) then ignored it from July until October.
I have played it with 13, it is perfect for everyone to get comfortable, particularly when there are new players.

I'm starting to like this a lot.  Sure, you can stare at your notes and try to deduce what everybody else is going to do, but sometimes you just have to take a blind stab in the dark with your camel.  Neat game.

Essentially, the same puzzle repeated three to five times.  Some potential for mis-direction and screwage (by placing your camel in the only safe space that an opponent could have moved to without paying a good).  Timbuktu is quite an original twist on the deduction game.  However, I found it dry, repetetive and not very much fun.

Queen's production is up to their usual standards.  The wooden camels are particularly nice, though their non-sticky labels are a bit of a pain.

Got this game (1995 "International" Queen version, "Tombouktou", missing the French rules somehow) as a 2006 XMas present and on 3/12/07 gave it a 5-player, three-board board run-through without researching it first, which was a mistake. The strategy hints in the old "English Rules" (file available for download at this site) were badly missed, as was something like the Babcock clue recorder (similarly available). I'm enough of a veteran boardgame-nut to put up with a blind and time-consuming walkthrough, and, by the time the third Oasis/Timbuktu was reached, had pretty much figured out that (and to some degree how) Soduku-like analysis of the thief clues would give you tactics. And I shared that, but by then the experience of playing mostly blind to what to look for had frustrated the less dedicated players, probably beyond recall... And it's Queen Games fault. The only suggestion that I can find as to what tactics might be appropriate is the sentence, BEFORE you're told how to apply stickers: "On the lower edge [of each caravan board] there is an overview of the thief cards..." Don't stop to ponder the fact that only only -some- combinations happen, and you start with hardly any idea what you're doing. How expensive could it have been to include some hints and a preprinted pad for recording clues? ...  I'm rather dubious (admittedly, after not much experience) about much gameplay there is here. The player-interaction elements are weak, so the experience seems a bit like playing simultaneous solitaire. I am considering variants like playing with the clues face-up (no rotation) to see if the players have effective (not merely marginal) ways to play against each other rather than merely avoid thieves; transfer goods captured by your set of thieves to your camels (or maybe even capture whole camels); trade between players, etc. to see if there's a stronger game to be made with these rather nice (and not cheap) components. Does anyone have a line on variations like this?

Juego de deducción. Cada jugador deberá avanzar sus camellos a una de las 5 líneas disponibles en el tablero siguiente, sabiendo que al final de cada etapa, las caravanas de camellos serán asaltadas cuando se detengan en un oasis. En cada línea serán asaltados 2 de los camellos los cuales perderán 2 tipos de bienes. A medida que avanza la tapa, los jugadores irán recibiendo más pistas, las cuales deberán agregar a sus conclusiones acerca del comportamiento de los otros jugadores.
Algo interesante es que al final del juego los bienes tendrán más valor, mientras más de ese tipo de bien a sido robado en total.

Played this a second time and pulled the rating down some.  

I found myself spending more time thinking about how to write an AI algorithm to play the game well than really engaging with it myself.

It's novel and it presents interesting logic puzzles.  Maybe that would be fun on my own, but I really don't feel like scribbling notes and doing heavily analysis while my friends wait.  But if you're not solving your move, then what's the point?


-----------------------

Rating based on just one play.

What I liked about this most was that it was different than other games.  Beyond that though, I enjoyed myself but I'm not sure how thrilled I was.

My biggest worry is that we all got pretty close to optimum play, which made the game feel like it came down to luck.   Any of us could have played even better, but not without slowing the game down in analysis.

So I'm a bit worried that the game is choice between too much luck or too much analysis paralysis.

Ötletes a mechanizmus, de mi a hossza alapján amolyan átvezető játéknak szántuk, a dobozra írt játékhossz alapján, ehhez képest fárasztó, komoly odafigyelést igénylő játék. Kicsit a Cluedo jutott eszembe róla, de ez annyiban kiegyenlítettebb, hogy mindenki pontosan ugyanannyi információhoz jut hozzá. A logikázás mellett persze elég nagy a szerencsefaktor, mert vannak információhiányos időszakok, és még minden infó birtokában is kirabolhatják a tevéinket. Egynek jó volt...

I'm afraid I was harsh in my rating, but that reflects the fact that I was frustrated during the whole course of the game. During the 2nd round things were a bit better. It seems like a promising idea that remained abstract and just doesn't work as well as planned. You can play the game, it's not bad or broken, but I for one did not enjoy it.
So far the only Dirk Henn game I very much enjoyed is Shogun.

RATING: 6
A deductive reasoning game which reminds me of clue. You are trying to get camel caravans accross a dangerous desert where robbers are waiting to steal your goods. Whoever has the most goods at the end typically wins. You are given cards which provide information on one robber, so through positioning your camels you can typically avoid it. But the other robbers are hidden but through some game mechanisms you will usually get to see 2-3 of the robbers by passing cards. To do well you must remember who the robbers were and try to deduct which robbers are on which caravan routes from other player actions. Its clever but single minded, thus slightly tedious. A plus is that I find the game presentation attractive.

I really enjoy deduction games (see my #1 game) so Timbuktu (or "Tombouctou" as my box states) is right up my alley. Move your camels to the safe spots and at the same time make your opponents put their camels on the theft areas. Cool game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A unique an inventive positional placement game with an appealing combination of deduction and risk management. During each round, players will slowly get their hands on more information about danger spaces, but perfect information will never be available, so a certain amount of educated guesswork to base strategic placement decisions on will always be needed. Movement is driven by simultaneous camel selection. Track length and herd-size are adjusted to suit different player amounts.

Players lead their own camel herd through a desert stretch in one communal pack, trying to hang on to as many of their carried goods as possible by keeping them safe from thieving hands en-route to Timbuktu. The board is split up in a series of grids and players will move all their camels from one to the other. Movement to 2 of the 5 nearest columns on the next grid is free. All other columns can be reached when a camel lengthens the load by ditching a good. After a grid is completed, 5 teams of thieves move in and rob 2 predetermined spaces in each column, from 2 team-specific goods. Scarcity increases the value of goods, and the herdsmen who gets the most valuable goods to Timbuktu is the winner.

I'm becoming a huge fan of Dirk Henn's designs and the way Queen transmogrifies them from decently self-produced kits to superbly produced games that skilfully merge strong visual appeal with play-friendly design.

By allowing people to take notes during play, Queen also tackled the weakest rule in the original head-on. Otherwise the player in the group best capable to memorize a handful of simple but confusingly similar combinations will win, and you probably won't need a game to know who this is. It would have been nice if rub-off note aids had been provided, but it probably would have tipped the production cost over the edge, as the game is awash with high quality playing pieces, including very cute camels. Ziplocks are provided, which is great service.

Between camel turns, players will look at their notes over and over again, making this a fairly slow playing game, but thankfully the camel selection is simultaneous, keeping downtime issues off the board. There isn't much variety in your actions though, and there is a risk that the longer 4 or 5 player game will become repetitive. Simply removing a stage board is an option, but that does reduce catch-up opportunities and strategies that only come into play in the latter stages of the game. Camels who have lost most of all their load can be used in many interesting ways, something that also only comes into play on the longer treks across the desert. Throughout, there probably as many things to be learned from careful observation as from the information cards, and it probably hides more placement strategies than you might realise initially.

Players who react well to deduction elements in games will lap this up. A bit of luck is needed, especially initially when placement is guided by patchy info at best. But as this game progresses, it becomes more and more strategic and involving. That it has next to no games that play similar is a bonus, but it is best played occasionally as frequent replays will increasingly highlight its static and repetitive nature over the clever deductive and strategic elements that will seduce most newcomers to it.

1 playing with 5.  There's an interesting deduction game in here, but its trying to get out...  The deductive parts are interesting but the lack of control is so huge that what you know seems to play far less of a role than it should.  Also feels quite long for what it is, with our first game clocking in at around 3 hours.  You could probably get in two games of Slueth in that amount of time...

Boring camel placement game shining for its lack of theme and setting: why would a raider only steal, say, salt and pepper out of a couple of camels in a caravan packed with gold and spices?
More than a game it feels like a poor excuse for an IQ showing off, since it forces you to remember the combinations of the soon-to-be-raided camels and wares and guess those you didn’t check.

A nice deduction game if you're into that type of game. The robbers can be quite painful in the game which you notice then it's time to calculate the final score.
Some tactics are obvious, but I feel there is something deeper in the game.
Can be a real brain burner if you like, but we always play with the famous gut feeling instead. Usually quite close games.
Can be played quite.

I've only played this once. It's a game of deduction as you try to work out which of the positions on the track will be attacked by raiders. You have limited information and are restricted in where on the track you can place your camels and have to juggle the placing in such a way to limit the number of thefts you suffer. It's a good game but requires a lot of thought and you never have enough information to be totally safe.

4/24/06 - camels are all saddled up and ready to ride! Cool camel bits; nice board(s) there are 4 gameboards - 2 are used in a 3-player game, 3 used in 4-player game, 4 used in 5-player game. Components are top notch in this game. I want to play this one NOW!

Update:
1 play - 3 player. We played this without pen and paper (contrary to what is suggested in the rulebook). Need to play this with pen and paper which will eliminate the memory aspect of the game and allow players to focus on the strategic and tactical play which I can see would be a huge part of this wonderfully produced game.

Further update:
1 play - 4 player game. This is a tough one to understand. After two plays of this I'm perplexed by the game. Not sure yet if there is much control over the value of the goods since when you lose a good it becomes more valuable so, if you play to lose some of your goods then you'll be left with very few but they'll score big - but your opponents will also score big or bigger than you since they didn't play that way. A lot of effort is needed to play this game and it is a longer game to play - there are more oasis's added for more players. Need to try this again to see if there is something I'm missing.

An excellent game this of deduction to avoid where the thieves are hiding and what they will steal. Gte as much goods as you can to the city of timbuktu. The points are then awarded at the end where each good is worth the amount that have been moved out of the game. 1 Play.

RATING: 9
I really like this game.  Deduction games are great when they work.  This game works.  The only problem with this game is that the deduction doesn't click with everyone.  I think they deprive themselves of the depth of the deduction, relying on luck, when they could think a bit more and make a good play.  Some say that the decisions you make towards the end of the round are luck based, but I disagree.  Part of the game is minimizing your loss based on information.  Bayes theorem stuff.  This includes prepping the play in future rounds by playing certain camels in earlier rounds, and not being afraid to lose a good to move into a non-allowed pen.  Every move by every player has good information in it, it's just a matter of not being lazy and choosing to use it.  Some people will not like this game because they don't have the attention span.  If you play the game right, you cannot play this in 45 minutes....try 2 hours.  I went through a whole game only losing 5 out of 20 goods.  Trust me, this game is not about luck.  Don't let the neighsayers fool you.

I'm starting to wonder if I'm handing out too many 8s -- every time I like a game a lot on initial plays, I seem to give it an 8.  But so far I really like Timbuktu.  It's the sort of deductive problem I lose myself in, but the deduction is combined with some decision-making.  A truly adept player would not only deduce but would also induce, based reading on his opponents' plays.  Simple rules, big role of memory, deduction, and heavy brainburn.  I could see others finding it a little repetitive but I think the game plays at a nice modest length.

Received via a math trade for the base copy of Puerto Rico.

After one play, this is a solid 7. My wife and mom both enjoy deduction games, and so I was curious to try one other than the Clue hidden card mechanic.

It's a bit hard to rate this game after one play. The key indicator will be if repeat plays enables us to read each other's choices better... using player choices as more information for deducing the good and bad spots. I think this is the case, so I expect this game will improve with familiarity and a little extra brinksmanship.

Update: Well, I got impatient and sold this one in an auction. One play was not enough to tempt me to try this one again. Ironically, I think the best deduction game I've played is Mystery of the Abbey, despite the fact I traded that one away previously!

This game I first played on some forgotten Spiel; and I didn't renew the acquiantance for at least a decade. I played with a slightly wrong rules interpretation causing the game to become quite thinky and not all that unpleasant... at least until you figured out how to make the most of the hidden information and delaying placement for as long as possible. With the correct rule in place the game would become decidedly more chaotic (and lighter). As such it's probably not one of Dirk Henn's worst designs (which is damning with faint praise, to be honest), but it [i]is[/i] very repetitive and probably not sufficiently interesting to play more than a few times. There's simply very little to see, much less plan for.

I've had mixed results with deduction games: the standard Clue is a game that I have always enjoyed, even though because I find it too easy it really hasn't satisfied the deduction itch; Mystery of the Abbey has proven to be a game that I find boring - not enough player interaction with the number of players that we play with at home.  The game seems almost artificial with three players.  Will Timbuktu serve my interests or will it prove too much deduction and not enough [fun] game for my family?  

My only play was a big success.  It was fun, without being at all tedious, like some deduction games can be.  Want to play again.

Played once.  So far, I like it a lot, and would definitely like to try it again.  I played the Queen version, in which note-taking is allowed, so the game becomes more deduction based than memory based.  I don't think I'd like it nearly as much without the note-taking.  Also, the Queen production values are excellent.

Someone on the listing for Timbuktu asked if guessing the right space to land your caravans on was the only decision you have to make in this game. Well, yes, essentially, that *is* all you have to do. But you never have perfect intelligence as to what is where, and outguessing your opponents either works or backfires right in your face. The game is not the deepest strategy game I've ever played, but it is fun, takes a short amount of time, and is accessible to virtually everyone. And the new Queen Games edition is gorgeous.

How can I think while my brains are burning?  This is a tough deduction game, in a similar vein to Sleuth.  Sleuth is more elegant, of course, but whereas in Sleuth, one person's error can mess up the game for everyone, Timbuktu only lets you mess things up for yourself.

Good blend of deduction, simultaneous cardplay and sequence timing. The deduction element isn't overwhelming since you can play well with just educated guesses and taking account of what your opponents are doing. At specific times, the actual sequence of who plays when can be more important as trains fill up.Plays quite fast (unless you're playing with people who want it to be a full on deduction/calculation game).

RATING: 6
With five players, the downtime as everyone consults his notes comes close to outweighing the enjoyment. With fewer players, what at first seems to be a bland experience with a few straightforward deductions becomes in its later stages quite a compelling game. Camels that have lost most or all of their goods can be used in interesting ways to acquire information at fairly low cost.

Rating after 1 play. I don't think this a brainburner like everyone else mentions.   Of the 5 paths, you know information about only 1 of them at the start.  Maybe by the time you place your 4th camel, you'll know info about 3 of them.  The rest has to be guessed by interpreting other player's actions.  You can combine goods left on your camels with the goods info from the thief cards you haven't seen to help make your selection.  So that's worth a little info, but still that only manages the risk, not eliminate it.  So in the end, you generally have to make some guesses.  That's not altogether bad though since it's not a long game.

Players are running their camel trains, carrying goods, across the board.  During each round of camel movement, from one waterhole to the next, several thefts will take place.  Players are given Cluedo-like advanced warning at which spaces the theft will take place, and what will be stolen, if your camel is occupying that space.  At the end of the game, any goods you're still carrying are given a point value based on what was stolen (clever!).  For years I'd heard about this as being a brain burner, and it is to some extent, but in reality it's not bad at all.  Good game, part deduction, part playing the odds, quite quick too.  The Queen edition has lovely bits.

First of all, I suck at this game. I have never won. Ever. Yet, I own it and I keep suggesting that it hits the table, because the components are some of the finest I have ever seen in any game, the theme rocks and the creative twist on the deduction mechanism rules! This is a keeper.

[b]9.28.09 Update:[/b] I finally won at the last F5 game night. It was a 3 player game and it was the first time we played the customized side of the player board. It was way more fun being able to set up your camels any way you thought was best. It provided more strategy and depth. However, that being said, this game still has far too much luck for me to enjoy much. I will still play it sparingly.

This game was a pleasant surprise. I enjoyed my game of Tombouctou. I played it for the first time on the big gameday on July 1st 2006. This is basically a memory game. I am not a huge fan of memory games, but Tombouctou would be an exception to the rule. The reason is that Tombouctou is a bit different than your typical memory game.

Basically in Tombouctou, at the end of each turn, a thief steals stuff off the camels. Their is a thief in one spot in each row. The goal of the game is to keep as much stuff on your camels as possible. Each item is worth something at the end of the game. The most points wins.

Have both editions. This is a very interesting deduction game, with informnation passing clockwise each round. You must bring your camels through the desrt without being robbed. Very cleverly, the stolen goods are counted up at the end and set the value of what reaches the marketplace. As I played, I found that there was more to be deduced from the other players' decisions than first appears. A very interesting game I will enjoy testing further.

RATING: 8
Nice deduction game where the deduction isn't the ultimate goal (although it certainly HELPS).  Careful camel placement & loss reduction are other key points.  A lot of thinking between moves makes this better suited for "gamers" than the family crowd.

Queen's new production looks great and doesn't feel "dated."  Hopefully, this will keep the game alive for years to come!  With 5 players, I recommend reducing the length to 3-4 rounds.  Grade: B

This game is decent fun.  I had high expectations for it.  I really like Dirk Henn, I respect many of the people who gave it high marks.  However, the chance elements can be really irritating.  On the one hand, it's part of the nature of the kind of game it is.  But I hate when you get a streak of "bad luck" with a game like this.  I guess after many plays it balances out.  I've only played this 4-5 times or so.  However, these irritating elements increased with each play and I liked it less and less.  I'll continue to play it, because it is captivating and fun.  But can also be very irritating.

I may upgrade this rating the moment I feel I'm getting some degree of control over what is happening.  As it is, I'm playing more on instinct as the sparse information must be inferred from other players' moves and the clues I get from the 3 hands I get to see (too late sometimes).  But the game itself is wonderful as it really feels like a game.  I guess note-taking could improve the quality and efficiency of every move, but this would remove some of the charm of trying to guess which road is the safest.  I also feel the game would be tedious and repetitive with 5 players, 3-4 works best I think.

I like deduction games, and this is a good one.  Unlike games such as Mystery of the Abbey, or Clue Timbuktu uses the mechanic in a fresh way.  Having a good memory helps, as does a little luck, good deductioning skills, and as the game progresses being able to bluff well also aids in play.  I like the stretching of brain cells this title offers that most euros shy away from.  Timbuktu offers great laughs, and a lot of fun for a reasonably quick play time.

Fun game - especially if you name your camels and have to remember them each round.

Also ignore the rule which says you can write down where the thieves are going and what they are going to steal - this makes it far too easy. You must remember this yourself when you hand your cards along.

Lots of fun packed in this game. Components look great, but I did not like the fact that you have to apply all the stickers to the 40 camels and I wonder how long they will stay stuck without having to glue them later down the line.

As you have heard this is a deduction kind of game. I didn't find it nearly as brain burning as a lot of people have claimed. I almost didn't buy it. Due to so many people mentioning the brain burning aspect of the game. I however did use pencil and paper to keep track of the thieves. This didn't seem to detract from the game at all. I am out for a fun experience with other players. Not a mental meltdown of wits between each other.

There are a lot of laughs when someone has a lot of their goods stolen and also a lot of bad words when it happens to you continually, but OMG what a fun experience. I am very happy that I took a chance and decided to get this game. 

I highly recommend this game for everyone. It can be a fun family game with non-gamers or a heavily matched battle of wits when played with the advanced variation without the pencil and paper to keep track of the thieves. There's a lot to offer here to please most people.

First and most importantly, you absolutely must allow the players to take notes during the game.  I've trod the path to Timbuktu with and without note-taking, and its desert flowers only bloom when notes are allowed.  There is way too much to remember without notes - every round you're learning three different combinations of two goods/two stops/one caravan, and then the entire thing is repeated again and again in different permutations in future rounds.  That's too taxing on my memory.  By the end of the game, I'm lucky if I can recall just one of the three-card sets, and I'm better than most at memorization.  But with notes, Timbuktu is terrific!  With players' brains freed from the drudgery of memorization, they can pay attention to what their opponents are doing and make smart guesses about what information they might have.

This is strictly a five-player game in my opinion.

The new Queen edition is so gorgeous that I'm tempted to dump my db-Spiele edition.  The Queen edition explicitly allows note-taking, smartly eliminating a point of contention in the old version. [b][UPDATE][/b] Yup, I went ahead and bought the Queen edition.

RATING: 7
Very colourful deduction heavy game. Components are good even if, in the copy I've seen, stickers on the camels where falling off. Overall good production values. 

As for the game this is a deduction heavy, brainburner. There is also a certain degree of hazard and cutthroat which makes playing this game cognitively hard. I can also see that there are many layers and nuances not immediately visible, some practice is needed to play well. And, if all play well, this may well produce analysis paralysis even in the habitually decisive players. 

That said, I'm in no rush to play this again, but I don't think I would turn down a game as long as I don't feel tired or mentally exhausted (something that, alas, happens too often).

An interesting idea that just didn't do much for me. At the time I was reminded of some other games, but I can't remember now what they were.

Players control camels bringing several different goods across the desert. At each stop, thieves will take particular goods from particular spots. With limited information, players must try to avoid theft and simultaneously increase the value of certain goods so that by the end, their remaining goods are worth the most points.

Pretty dry (excuse the pun) and not very engaging. The amount of control was limited to such a degree as to feel it didn't even matter what choices you made.

For first time players, the first set is often enough for them to get a handle on the rules, strategy and tactics of the game.  One could almost play a special "reset" and give everyone back their goods after the first set of thefts and continue the game from there.  It might make some players less frustrated that they lost so many goods while getting the hang of the game, and everyone feels the game is moving along and not really resetting.

Not your run of the mill deduction game. Very clever design where players can intuit or be bluffed by each other's moves. A nice elegant scoring system as well. I played without any note taking, not sure if that's the rule or a variant, but I suspect it's quite playable either way.

One usability gripe: Stupid squiggly lines! Why? Make them straight.

I'm good at this game, but I just don't enjoy it very much. It's an interesting logic problem, but it seems less like a game and more like a puzzle to me. Maybe I'm missing some aspect of player interaction, but it mostly seemed like others can't really get in your way because they have the same limited information as you do. In terms of strategy, don't be afraid of the spots that make players pass cards - the more information you have, the more likely you are to make valid inferences.

Wow, Timbuktu is the first deduction game I've ever played that didn't suck.  Man, I'm glad I bought it.  The bits are super nice (although make sure you get those stickers on real tight or they'll peel) and the gameplay is smooth as butter.  There's just enough information to make some sure guesses, and a little bit of information to make some shakey ones.  I particularly like the economic effect of scarcity on goods that develops the final scoring.  This game just feels tight, elegant, and plenty mean enough to avoid the regular problem in deduction games - make one wrong turn and you're out.  Here, many wrong turns will be taken by all!

Did I mention I love the bits?

Update:  There are some issues with seating order that can unbalance the game if some people aren't good at deduction games.  Timbuktu can also become very brain burning if played over analytically.  Make sure you have the right group before attempting otherwise it won't be nearly as good.

RATING: N/A
Mixed feeling: 
It can be played as a heavyweight brainburner and it works (mostly at full complement) or as a sort of happy-go-lucky memory game and it works. 

It's a little dry (ba-dum-tss), but I wouldn't say no to a game once in a while.

Wow.  This one really caught me.  I really like it.  Unprecedented depth in a Euro game.

Updated - downgraded mostly due to not being able to get anybody to play it.  If nobody likes it, why do I like it so much?

RATING: 6
After 1 play.

Much better than I thought it would be.  I expected 100% deduction with no fun.  What I got was a lot of deduction and a bit of fun.
Of course if you play with pencil and paper (which I don't recommend) and think heavily over every move it might be 100% deduction.  And 100% of pure boredom and insane downtime.
If I'm to play it ever in the future, it will be not in this 'total brain burning' manner.  I'm not going to miss the fun.

Played once and need to play again.  This is a deduction game kind of like sleuth where you have a limited amount of information about which of your camels are going to be stolen from, and you have to guess where to place the rest of them based on this information.  Fun but takes a little long with a full complement.  I would like to play it with 3 or 4 instead of 5.

During my first play of this game, I knocked over a wine glass, covering half the board with red wine. Undeterred, we wiped everything down and started over. I think I've determined that deduction games aren't my thing. It wasn't a bad game, but it wasn't terribly fun, either. The hidden information and forced guessing makes the game feel too random even though there's technically not a lot of randomness in the game.

I've played it a second time now with a different group and I might have warmed up a bit to this game, but not so much that I'm dying to play it again.

Could be the best deduction game I've played.  Not sure I would want to play with less than the full 5, which means it won't hit the table as often as I'd like.  Also, there are some types of gamers that I know just won't enjoy this game.  The audience is slim, much like RoboRally.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (November 2011)

I didn’t want to play this (and still resist it sometimes) based only on the theme. For me the theme is dry and very boring but the gameplay is good enough I can ignore that. This is a deduction/memory game (my kind of game). I understand the rules allow for players to take notes but I have not played that way because I feel the game would be much easier. I will try it with notes sometime in the future so I can comment on that but I think I would not like the game as much that way.

The game components are gorgeous, except for the stickers that (constantly) usually gets unglued from your camel. The mechanics are pretty simple but the gameplay is very tense. You have to manage the risk as you begin only with 1/5 on the information and as the round progresses you can get at the most ½ of the information of where and what the robberies will occur. That means that many times you will have to move without knowing if you will get robbed or not. As I have pretty good memory I think I have an advantage over most game mates, however as the game progresses you can mix up the information in your head, making this a bit of a brain burner (Which I like).

I feel the game is a bit longer that I enjoy. I would like if the game finished 1 leg earlier. 

The scoring system is very clever, you get more points for deliver the kind of goods that were mostly stolen, however, the player with most goods at the end (no matter what goods) will probably win.  

I want to play it again and I would love to play it if the theme was more appealing to me.

A definite brainburner. Players afflicted with analysis paralysis should stay clear.

At the beginning of the game, I felt there was too much information (both hidden and revealed) to make calculated decisions, but by the end, I could see opportunities unfold in front of me.

Keeping notes with pen and paper is a bit fiddly. Use the player aid found on BGG!

NOTE: There is an issue with stickers coming off. Recommend using a glue stick to fix the problem.

Even though it's definitely a lot easier than some of its more hardcore deduction game brethren, this can still definitely be a brain burner.  Depending on your opponents, it can be really easy to deduce where the thieves will strike.  But it gets more interesting later on as the camels have their stock depleted - it is possible to bluff your opponents.  The main problem with the game is that it is subject to A/P problems, depending on the player.  I would really enjoy this game in an hour, but if it lasts too long some of the fun disappears.  I have to admire Dirk Henn for being such a versatile designer.  I really like the camel meeples in the game - the whole package is very nicely done.

RATING: 8.5
Semi-blind camel placement game. In a way, I see this as a better, more fleshed out version of Palatinus. There's quite a lot of information to track, but players basically just need to make educated guesses until they deduce where the thieves will strike.

Fairly short and easy to learn, although the game can slow down a bit if the players want to "overthink" their turn.

Talán kicsit túlságosan absztrakt, de mivel eléggé oda kell(ene) figyelni a játékmenetre, nincs sok alkalom azon sopánkodni, hogy nem elég tematikus.

I'm not a deduction gamer but this is a deduction game that I don't stink at!  It's doesn't have nearly the complexity of Code 777 or Sleuth but I like it.  It does burn your brain a bit but I can actually figure most things out.  For a less longish game, play with fewer boards.

An elegant deduction game where the actions of the bandits are cleverly controlled and the value of the goods are based on the scarcity when the camels reach their destination.

07/25/06 Played about 45% of a game, once, of Tombouctou. A bit like Clue in that there's a large memory/deduction element. Its not a brain burner, but it does seem prone to analysis paralysis. A little tedious. Though its a nice looking game. I might play it again, but I wouldn't ask for it. There's nothing wrong with it. It just didn't grab me. I think I played enough to form an opinion; "eh".

I enjoy the gameplay and design of Henn's take on deduction.  However, every once in awhile you just don't have enough information to know where to go... and this is where luck comes in.  The other problem is that if you really want to play this the right way it should be a brain-burner and that's just too much paper-work especially considering the fact that some of your deductions are often based on what the other players are doing.  Problem being that your opponent's may not have a clue.  My feeling is that if I tried this again with experienced players my rating would go up (a bit).

This is a great deduction game that rewards a little bit of risk taking but also good memory

Can be played as a two player game, but it really shines with more.  Good amount of 'arms length' player interaction and strategy with a little AP if you are prone to it, but still it means that you can chat to the other players between turns, making it a great game to play with people you haven't caught up with in a while

Gameplay is really easy to grasp after a turn or two as well.  It isn't a heavy thinky type game, so suitable for all ages

Really like this one and hope to get to play it more as the years go on

Played once.  The game is based on moving camels up a series of tracks over five rounds; some positions on the tracks have negative effects occur to camels on them at the end of each round.  The movement of each camel is restricted by its position on the board, and players only know 1 to 3 of the 5 possible negative effects that will occur each round.  The number of possible moves/positions that need to be analyzed before deciding which camel to move is extremely large; players must consider the information they know for certain about which spaces will get negative effects at the end of the round, the probabilities that other spaces on the board will have negative effects (which requires analyzing other players' prior movements and all possible combinations of unseen negative-effect cards), the effect other players' movements (during this turn) will have on their movement options, the resources each of their specific camels is carrying, and the restricted movement possibilties of each camel.  Thus, to play well, each player must agonize over each camel's move, and since each player must move at least 25 camels during the game, if the game is played strategically it will necessarily slow to a crawl.  And, thanks to the high impact of stochastic events (the negative effect cards and how your camel placements at the end of one round match up with the negative effects of the coming round), the game is not worth playing at a crawl.  

What frustrates me most is that there is (almost certainly) a single logically optimal move for each player at each point in the game, yet it's tedious and time consuming to figure it out.  I'd have much more fun programming a computer to play through the game for me.

2nd edition from Queen Games. Since the 2nd edition allows you to write down information, you can focus on deduction part without worrying too much about your memory. It's not guaranteed that you can deduct all the information(some cards you will never see, and sometimes you just have to guess from other players' moves). This was a bit of a dissapointment to me. Overall a good game, but feels a bit old.

A fun, highly interactive deduction game that's marred significantly by its play time. The game page claims a 45 minute playtime, but with 5 it's likely to run twice that, which is probably too much for a game that runs so similarly from start to end. House-ruling things to reduce the number of rounds seems wise, even if it might create minor first-player advantages. Clever and cute, to a point.

It took longer than I thought it would, but then again our initial play included a hopeless non-gamer and a known APer. So not quite the quick filler I was hoping for. The game itself is repetitive by nature, without much of an arc through 5 rounds, although it does get easier to avoid being stolen from as the game goes on. The best part is the thief reveal at the end of each stage. I'm hoping it plays much faster next time.

Interesting puzzle/logic mechanic. It seems that you'll probably want to sacrifice one camel to probe unknown areas or drop into a bad position. Only played with the default camel setup, but if you choose which goods to load on the camels it seems like it might be a good idea to specialize. I might suggest this next time we play.

After more plays, I'm not sure this one is worth it. If I want a good logic/deduction game, I'll play Sleuth or Zendo. As it is, this game is a bit too random and the logic only comes from guessing what other people know.

RATING: 5.5
Nice deduction game (there are not that many fine deduction games).

The components are nice, except for the camel badges (the stickers lose the glue) and the graphic design is functional but beatiful.

The theme is not perfect, but it works fine :-)

I wouldn't like relying on memory to play it. There are nice handouts that allow you to take note of the clues you see every round, but then deductions are too easy. This is for me the biggest issue, and I have not found any workaround for that.

RATING: 6
Deduction game with a hint of memory game (I like to play without notes). Playing is a bit on chaotic side since you don't have ever full information about thieves and you even don't know which camels are moving after you. It seems to be almost a perfect fit for my gaming taste with these elements. Biggest annoying thing about game is that stickers on camels don't stick with their original glue. I superglued them onto camels!

Update (19.11.2007): Five player game can take quite a while and there doesn't happen too much moving from second-to-last oasis to final one as almost everyone can hold their precious cargos a bit and/or play to safe spots. Yes, a couple tiles will be lost because of moves you must make to avoid bad positions or by bad luck. Game is also quite repetitive as every journey is exactly the same. I'll try to play next time with one board less than five players normally would to shorten the game a bit.

This is a nice mid-length game. I tend not to play with the camel cards because managing so many things can be a bit unwieldy for a game that doesn't have that much strategy. I have found that this game goes over well with those who enjoy puzzles and deduction.

Based on one play: A game of deduction. The mechanics are fairly simple, move your camels from one section to the other and try to avoid the five thieves that will steal your goods in each of the next three section. You get to see three thieves per section, however not all at once, so you need to make some deductions and sometimes just hope for the best.

Semplicissimo e cattivo al punto giusto. Il meccanismo di calcolo dei punti privilegia i giocatori con le merci più razziate, e a ogni turno possono cambiare le quotazioni. Da non giocare col mal di testa: tutte le cose da ricordare memoria fanno friggere il cervello.

I enjoy the simple mechanics and the deduction aspects, but it feels it goes on a bit too long and the game is about 1/3 chaos and 1/3 luck.  Add that when someone gets a lead, about all you can do is hope they make mistakes.  I think the game needs 5 rounds though to help even out the luck/chaos.

Players guide their herd of camels laden with goodies through roads to the titular destination. However, thieves will steal certain goods along certain spaces in the five roads. As to which goods, which spaces and which road that is provided by packets of info passed around the table. But you will only know 3 packets for sure, the rest you have to deduce from opponent's movements of the camels. I love deduction games but trying to determine what info could be in each packet is a bit heady, as not only could an opponent give clues by avoiding a space in a road, but also occupying a threatened space (because the camel doesn't carry the goods desired by the thief)can throw you. Once at Timbuktu you sell your goods, in the same way in King Lui, neatly showing scarcity increases price. So interesting, but too much of a mental stretch and until packets start being passed, you can be (un)lucky.

Extremely good game.  The hand-made (dbSpeile) edition I had had some mis-printed cards, so I am glad that I also own the newer, over-produced Queen edition.

Thought this was the "brain burner" everyone spoke about until the second round - it's not. It's simple deduction (note: simple, not "Murder in the Abbey" wait-until-the-last-round, not-enough-info deducation). You get som pretty good information coming your way each turn, and then it's about risk management. Enjoyed it more than I thought I would.

Can be a bit of a thinker. Get your camels to Timbuktu without losing too many of the goods they carry to thieves waiting in each section of the board. The information of where the thieves will attack will gradually become known each phase, still leaving some deduction work. Good fun.

A rare beast - a deduction game where winning requires best use of imperfect information.  You have hard evidence (what you've seen) and soft evidence (what you deduce from others' action) and statistical evidence (X is less likely than Y).  You factor these together to find the safe play, prioritising the highest risk moves.  Good fun.

A brain burner, chaotic if players don't take notes. A game of deduction and odds management.

Provisional rating after one play.  Because of the brainpower necessary, it's clearly not a game that can be played for 'fun' all the time; however, every now and then, I can see how much fun this would be, trying to figure out info based on other people's plays, taking calculated risks in sending your camels out, and simply hoping that everyone else doesn't play 'rock' when you play 'scissors'.  A very interesting mix of issues.  My only concern is that it might be a very slow game when played with the right rules.  Time will tell if this is the case.

RATING: 5.5
Each round starts with too little information and not enough maneuverability to utilize the information you do have. Anyone that opens a round with a "1 pitch" thief card is stuck playing a guessing game with the other four pens. I was stuck in this situation 3/5 of the rounds and guessed wrong twice to devastating consequences. Nothing like getting knocked out of the game due to simply guessing wrong. Once more information becomes available, the deduction aspect of the game comes into play and it does become an enjoyable, though agonizing, exercise. It won't matter if you guessed wrong in the earlier blind guessing part, though.

One of the best deduction games that I've ever played.  Players guide caravans through the desert trying to avoid thieves at the oasis.  They have to deduce where the steals are going to be made by their card hands and by the movements of the other players.  To consider the different probabilities about the information that is not known by them is a crucial part of the game.

Az első játékom alapján gyorsan kiderült, hogy az ilyen dedukciós játékok igazi rétegjátékok. Nekem személy szerint nagyon bejött, de a játékostársaim közül volt akinek egyáltalán nem. Ami szerintem teljesen érthető. Az ilyen típusú játékokhoz más hozzáállás kell, mint egy Ticket to Ride szintű játékhoz. Fontos a gondolkodás, ami lefáraszthatja az embert, de szerintem nagyon is kellenek az ilyen játékok is.
Gondold ki, hova viszed a tevédet a következő oázisban, az apró információk jó végiggondolásával kerülheted el a fosztogatókat és áruid így juttathatod el a végső célig. Aki a legtöbb értékben juttat el árut a végcélba, az nyeri a játékot.
Jegyzetelős, végig gondolkodós játék. Mindenképp olyanokkal érdemes játszani, akik kellően rá tudnak erre a szisztémára hangolódni, de ilyen emberekkel szerintem nagyon kellemes játékélményt fog nyújtani a Timbuktu.

[2013-04-15]
Nos folytatva a két és fél évvel ezelőtti gondolatot. Gondolkodós, a játékot komolyan vevő játékosokkal viszont igazából szerencsejáték. Ugyanis mikor nincs információ, akkor a szerencse dönti el, hogy ki melyik helyen mit fog elveszteni. Második játékra már egyáltalán nem éreztem, hogy ez kimondottan tetszene. Nem rossz játék, de nagyon sok jobb van nála. A kivitelezése viszont nagyon kellemes.

A brain burner to say the least that somehow manages to combine deduction with a bluffing element.  I like how it grows increasingly difficult as the game progresses, creating more tension and drama in the race for victory.  My brain still hurts!

I love deduction games!  "Mr. Jack" and "Fury of Dracula" are 2 of my top 5 favourite games of all time.  However, when "Mystery of the Abbey" failed to provide the fun factor I was looking for, and I discovered that "Timbuktu" was a group deduction game, I was excited to give it a try.  After reading the remarkably simple rules I was wondering how on earth a player would be able to "deduce" anything, but the first time I was able to figure out all 10 thieves in our first game was a great eureka moment!  It turns out this actually is a pretty decent little deduction game with an interesting economic element thrown in.  The production quality, while not quite as spectacular as "Mystery of the Abbey", is still top-notch.  You just can't go wrong with camels.  Or penguins.  (Hey!  That's my camel!)  The only thing you'll want to add to the game is the player aids created by BGG user BigWoo:  http://www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/22959.  Do yourself a favour and print them off, cut them out, laminate them, and purchase 5 "dry erase" markers.  Then you'll be all set to play a very fun game!

[1 play] Initial reaction rating.  Really more of a logic puzzle covering as a game.  I love logic puzzles so I did really enjoy this game and my rating reflects that I would love to try this game again.  The one thing I don't know about is that the game was pretty repetitive.  You move the camels to the next oasis and then the next, and then the next, and then the next.  It is always the same thing repeated five times.

RATING: 7
[Queen Games 'Timbuktu' 2005 edition] {Desert, merchant; memory, deduction, blind-action selection; optimal 5p} A nice deduction game with a strong Arabian theme.  It's unique enough to be in any game collection. It's funny to see other players are forced to lose goods or have their goods stolen.

The game rule is clear and intuitive. It is not a pure deduction game - it needs strategy and some tactical (or nasty) moves to score points. My game group does not take notes, which makes Timbuktu more challenging.

The component and artwork are elegant. The camels are cute. It'd be better if I don't need to work with the stickers.

It's not easy to design an interesting and functioning deduction game. Deduction games are inherently boring and brain-teasing.  This game, nevertheless, provides fun and good player interactions.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.25
An ok deduction-based game.  I like that the deductions aren't the victory condition in themselves, but rather a means to an end (getting your stuff to the end safely).  You don't get all the info for any round, and so have to make some educated guesses, and you can get lucky or unlucky early in a round, which adds some tension and groan-worthy moments when you realize later in the round that you just set yourself up to get totally robbed blind by the raiders.  We played a shortened 5-player game (four rounds instead of five), and I'm grateful in that I think it was starting to wear a bit old by that time.  It's not a bad game, but it started to get a bit repetitive.  Still, it's nice to have a deduction game that the winner isn't just the first person to declare it was Father Bruno in the Lobby with the Cube Tower or whatever, but rather who can put that info to the best use.

Really cool and really tough inference and bluff game.  Trying to figure what exactly is going on is very interesting.  I see some people here say this game will melt your mind, maybe they are right.  This game usually has a AH-HA I GOT IT moment for every player. Really good game,  the best Queen has offered for some time.

Fun, light deduction game. Certainly not a brain burner. Some things you know. Other things you can easily figure out. The rest you make reasonable guesses at. Another plus is that I don't have anything else quite like it in my collection, so it's "safe" in that regard.

Update [11/11/09]: Dropped two points to a '6'. Played today and thought, "meh -- I could do the work to figure this out but I just don't care. Too much work and not enough payoff.

Pros: Great for those who like deductive games. Fairly unque gameplay in that the deduction element is not a goal in itself but a means of helping you transport your goods safely.

Interesting game.  I'm not sure I'd call it deduction; there's just not enough information for that.  Its more a risk-taking game with limited info.  Its NOT a memory game, despite what some people comment; the rules even tell you to write things down!  The luck element can be annoying at times; sometimes you just don't have information you can really do anything with and must make a mostly random move.

A little intuition and deduction with a little bit of luck thrown in for good measure. Nice theme and bits in a fun game where you try to sell your remaining goods at the end of the game for the most profit. Beware the theives!

Not a bad little game based on the first outing.  The first play seemed chaotic, more like we were taking wild pot shots in avoiding the thieves for the most part.  But at least I could taste that there was more too it... much like I felt about Ra when I first played.  Subsequent plays have show me that isn't as chaotic as first percieved.  A solid game.

Timbuktu is a delightful deduction game.  It moves quickly and offers a large physical board (a rarity in the world of deduction).  Experts at 2nd and 3rd level deduction can gain an edge, but not one that prevents all of the players from enjoying the game all of the way through.  About the only thing missing from Timbuktu are erasable player aids, and those can be downloaded from the Geek.

I haven't really played a good deduction game. I have played games with elements of deduction, but not the real deal. This is the real deal. No yelling or arguing it plays quite at the table. It's a bit long. I also think it's a bit short on game mechanics. Not a bad game, just not a headliner.

Although the 45 minute play time is a bit of a joke, this is a pretty solid game.  As with any competitive deduction game, it can sink rapidly into AP territory, which might be alleviated a bit with a sand timer.  All-in-all, an enjoyable, and very handsome game.

This has too many things to think about. I feel like I could make the optimal play every time if I took 5-15 minutes per decision, but I don't want to spend that long on this game, so I felt like I was making substandard plays the whole game. No fun.

At the end of each stage, thieves will steal goods from the caravans when they stop at an oasis. Each player must engage in a Sudoku-like analysis of the clues he is given to determine which pitches in the new oasis will be struck by thieves and which will be safe places for him to rest his camels. As the round progresses, you gain more information about where the thieves will be. The object of the game is to be the trader left with the most value in goods when you reach Timbuktu.

RATING: 7
Timbuktu is a deduction game by the highly acclaimed Dirk Henn of Alhambra and Shogun fame. There are not a lot of well designed deduction games out there in the market. Timbuktu works extremely well in subtly providing various layers of partially hidden information for players to tease apart. To be successful in this game, one needs to tap into all these layers of information, including those that are directly (rotating thief cards) provided and the information that is indirectly observed from player choices. To be fair, luck can affect the game in the way caravans are being assigned in each row which can restrict placements in future rounds and when the partial information is revealed to you during each round. Early in the camel placement each round, there is often not enough information to completely place your camels in the safe manner. Late in the round when more information is available, there is often inadequate safe spots left for camel placement. Needless to say, you need several plays to discover how to extract the hidden information during gameplay to excel in Timbuktu.

fun; everyone should like this; thematic desert scene; kids will also love;  try to get your camel to the end without getting robbed of all of your goods after 4 or 5 rounds of movement; secretly see some of the areas that will get robbed and try to avoid them - bit of area control going on here and some pressing your luck; would be a most enjoyable to a broad section of gamers; I think the more players that you have playing it, the better it is

A light deduction game with a significant helping of chaos and luck.  It's probably my favorite of that type.  There's just enough deduction to keep be interesting and allow some control.  Educated guessing is the name of the game, and it is almost always pretty close.  A very good gateway game.  Nothing is too complicated mechanically, but there is enough thought to be had with only a very few rules.  Best of all, it's just plain fun.  Really a strong, light game.

Rated after five played games, where the first game was played with notes. Making notes about thieves pretty much ruins the idea of the game, it is better without notes. If there were more interaction, the game would be better, but I don't know how interaction could be implemented. The components are nice, but stickers won't stick to camels, which is quite painful. And camels in blue look horrible. Simple game, which is intuitive and easy to explain to new players. Deductive memory games are not for everyone, but there is a target audience for this game.

RATING: 7
Interesting but agonizing as your caravan is being robbed turn after turn. A quick guess will reduce the risk of being robbed considerably - figuring out exactly which route is safe to take should be possible most of the time, but is very hard to do. Quick competent guesses and a bit of luck will probably beat failed analysis.

Buen juego de deducción "tipo Cluedo" o "Misterio de la Abadía". Pero con muchos enigmas, lo que permite que el liderazgo del juego sea más disputado. Bueno para novatos en eurogames

Nice deduction game similar to Clue or "Mistery of the Abbey". There are multiples misteries to solve, and this allows to have many changes in the leadership of the game. Very good for newbies

A movement/deduction game in which you want to avoid the thieves on the path to Timbuktu. Unfortunately, you know only a drop of information and learn more only twice in each round -- then the round begins again and the thieves hide anew. Too long with five players, especially with those who ponder at great length; good with four or three.

I'm interested in trying the game with no notes, as suggested by Dan Blum, who always plays this way. Very curious...

RATING: 7
An okay deduction game, which is definitely not for the AP crowd. When played carefully, you can actually work out all the bad spots on the route, and in your setting up beforehand it is possible to make the most advantageous combinations of goods on your camels. Tactics seem to be along the lines of either positioning your own camels to avoid the thieves, or positioning your own camels so other people have no choice but to take the bad spots. Presumably can be played with pen and paper to keep track of what is where, but for a real challenge you'll want to do it without.

RATING: 5
A game from the "thinky if you want it to be, but ultimately not worth it" family.

That is, if players are sufficiently motivated, they can perform the mental acrobatics necessary to figure out the likelihood of each thief combination being each column (based on the actions of other players, all available combinations, etc.), and then play accordingly.

OR, players can decide that the game's middle-to-low level of enthrallment doesn't warrant this extravagant mental effort.  Having made this logical decision, said players will then make superficially reasonable plays based on whatever stray information they happen to remember from the card sets that they were passed.

You can probably guess which category I fall into.

Played once (with 5 players). Some very nice base ideas, which have been fleshed out into a too intense game. Maybe it would have been more enjoyable (and easier) with less players, but we had the feeling there was too much information and trying to play accordingly was more painful than enjoyable. Having more rounds with more players makes the game much longer (although it is good for balance reasons to have everyone start once). I will try to play it with fewer players next time.

Love the little camels! A brain teasing deduction game that requires a lot of thinking. Enjoyed the game but some parts were very slow and the lack of control over moves can ruin a very well thought out plan.

RATING: 5
Deduction game with camels. Try not to have goods stolen from your caravan as you cross the Sahara by avoiding dangerous spaces on the board. You'll need paper and pen, otherwise it becomes a difficult memory exercise. 
It can be annoying to have to make a move without knowing anything about where you are moving to. This is fair enough if your opponent played so as to put you in this position, but is worse when the game randomly forces you into it. 
There's an interesting scoring system where you get more points for goods that have been stolen from other players (representing their price rising due to reduced supply), but this aspect of the game is hard to control or play for. Trying to keep all your goods intact is probably a recipe for disaster. Instead, maintaining a couple of unaffected camels can be better.
Requires a sort of thinking I don't particularly enjoy. It's not a brain-burning game as such, but something about Timbuktu irritates me. It's as if it makes you use a different part of the brain; a part which also induces mild annoyance.

RATING: 7.9
Interesting deduction game.  Over the course of a round, 3/5 of the information about impending thefts will be revealed to you.  Through careful examination of the known information, you try to avoid the other 2/5.  Be the player who delivers the most goods to market.

A game of deduction and calculated risk. I didn't delve deeply into the logic puzzle elements, just skimmed the first level and avoided risks. Can cause paralysis of analysis and being forced to choose between two (or more) bad moves. Too deep to be a light game, but lacked the anxiety and aha! moments of deeper games.

Interesting twist to your standard deduction fares.  Since you won't completely figure out all of the card combinations available, and you definitely need a bit of luck to protect the goods you are carrying from being stolen.  I personally found that by allowing note taking, you take away a lot of the tension from the game, but I also realize some people are just not good at providing themselves with memorization cues.  Very tough decisions between occupying a thief space you know that's safe for your caravan or leaving it open for an unsuspecting opponent.

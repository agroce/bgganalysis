RATING: 4
:)
• Artwork is playful and semi-gruesome (+)
• Neat concept

:soblue:
• Game play is slow and drags on (prone to analysis paralysis with 'lite' gamers)
• The humorous nature of spell titles are ruined by the lack of funny/'punny' titles
• Dead Wizard cards provide little benefit to KO'd players
• Blood bonus points are earned infrequently, while many card effects utilize this feature

Slightly more complex.  Not sure how I feel about this game.  Might be better to just combine it with the base game, to dilute the creatures a little.  

The treasures and dead wizard cards seemed to not be that useful for the most part.  Didn't get through all of them though so can't be definitive about that statement.

I can definitively state I like the base game better, but the character cards in this addition are just as nice if not nicer.

I like the addition of creatures but Im not a fan of the blood magic. Plus they made the game more crass than the first. The first was fun and silly enough. It pushed the limit. This edition was to forward and obvious with some of the cards.

RATING: 8
Expands the base game in about as many ways as it could need, with Blood and Pets and making use of previous game components. I doubt I would play these separately, so I'll just mash them all together and hope they come out with even more later...

Copying verbatim my comment for [thing=112686][/thing]:

The name and art set very low expectations for me, so I was actually surprised when there ended up being more game here than I expected.  As far as gameplay goes, I could rate this a 5 ("I'll probably find it better than not playing a game."), but the utter juvenility of said name and art drops the game to a 3 ("I'll actively lobby to play something else instead.") for me.

RATING: 7.8
if you are willing to get into te silliness of this game and pretend you are a wizard with ridiculous spells, then this is a lot of fun. The downside is that this game has been designed with 4 players in mind, and that is where the sweet spot is!

RATING: 5
Pro's:

1) Even more spells!
2) Art is still great.
3) It is still pretty fun if the group is actually willing to go all out and do the voices.
4) Actually works well with alcohol.

Con's:

1) The added rules don't really do much, in fact it makes the game harder to teach and it feels like they are trying to take some of the elements of total luck out to make it slightly more strategic, but it doesn't work most of the time.
2) You never seem to get enough blood points to get the most out of the effects, unless I'm really not playing it correctly.

UGGGHH!! You had one job cryptozoic: make more Epic Spell Wars, but you tried to get fancy and add a bunch of new rules that just don't make the game better.

Blood: a "win more" mechanic that helps those who are already ahead.
Creatures: they make the game longer, which this game did not need.
Standee: hardly matters most of the time.
Reaction: something that is forgotten about half the time.

I might be able to salvage some of this and shuffle it in to the original AWESOME game, but I will have to be very careful.

RATING: 7
Loved the first game, but didn't like this one as much. The addition of creatures didn't seem well balanced at all, and since they stay out after having played them, it seemed that those to first play a creature almost always quickly knocked out anyone who hadn't.

This is supposed to be anarchic fun. I DO want to play a silly, anarchic, fun game.
 
"Epic Spell Wars of the Battle Wizards: Rumble at Castle Tentakill" is nothing of the above.

I don't mind the gross humor. I don't mind making a fool of myself by voicing out the crafted spells. I don't mind the rulebook that is so full of itself.

But behind the abundance of game elements there is not one interesting mechanic. The game offers neither the joy of going through motions (I would play any roll-and-move game over this) nor the joy of making tough decicions. You just pick the best combination of cards from your hand and play them, that's it. It's more of a tiresome administration effort than a creative thinking process.

It's more Epic Spell Wars, which I love, so.. can't really go too wrong.  The new mechanics of pets and blood don't add a ton to the game and, honestly, might even take away a little bit of the fun simplicity of the original, but it's a negligible change.  The black heart and metal soul of the game is still there, having new combinations and wild spells to play with is great, and it's still lots of fun at the core.

Played this with about 9 (combining with the other set). I can see it might be fun if you're in the right mode, and people are reading out their spells with appropriate zeal. But it's very swingy, and you don't have much control over what happens after you've chosen your spell. Maybe it's just better with smaller player count.  With so much damage flying around (esp the spells which travel round the table with increasing damage), we didn't last long enough to make any use of creatures.

I can see it getting a bit tired once you've laughed at all the silly spell names.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A lot of the same, with a few extra bits thrown in. I probably don't really, truly need both 1 and 2, but...

Also? As much as I like this game, one or two rounds is about all I really enjoy. If you're playing a four player game it gets pretty stale, imo, unless someone just steam rolls everyone...

I prefer this to the original, but mostly I enjoy merging the two sets. I was able to store them all in the same box and it's working quite well. The new blood, creature, and standee mechanics make the game really new and fresh. The second game also feels more cut throat and plays faster, especially once people get blood and/or the standee.

RATING: 5
Interesting concept, poor execution. There is not much strategy involved, really. You just draw cards and hope for the best, the luck factor is really high. If you are unlucky, you can be eliminated very quickly. It feels too long, particularly if you are out of the game in a couple of rounds and you have to wait an hour until somebody wins. The art is nice, though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fun, random game of matching powers and looking for power plays. Gaming purists might not enjoy it because it is incredibly luck-based, but games go fast and combining both Epic Spell Wars games mitigates the faults of both: Skullzfyre can drag on too long, and Castle Tentakill can be much too fast and deadly.  Good luck shuffling both decks though.

RATING: 5
Mostly funny, but sometimes less funny than it thinks it is, Epic Spell Wars is a silly game that reminds me a bit of Munchkin, if a bit more twisted. 

Players will play spell cards to attack one another. There are three types of spells (beginning, middle, end) of which one of each can be played to make a single powerful spell. Ostensibly, the various combinations would lead to interesting game play, but mostly there's so much randomness and take-that that it really doesn't matter much. 

There's no particular strategy to speak of, but the brainlessness can be an okay diversion. It's much shorter than Munchkin, as it should be, but it could probably stand to be shorter still. It's a gateway length game with less-than-filler weight choices to make.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Epic Spell Wars is one of my favorite card-based games and this expansion is definitely a must have. More wizards, more spells, more gore, more ridiculousness. If you like the original, you need this in your collection.

This is the cards 'n dice version of Sailor Jerry, Charles Manson and Walt Disney taking turns making Aleister Crowley airtight while the third wheel does the Buffalo Bill dance in the PCP space helmet.*

[b]Look, there's no mystery to it—if you're not sure if this is for you, it flat-out ain't.[/b]  I mean, c'mon—the title is a dead giveaway in this regard.

For me, the game effortlessly evokes the sensation I strive for in [i]every game I play[/i], and underscores my perennial disappointment with Euros.  [i]Epic Spell Wars[/i] is pure theme, entirely unmoored and aggressively in service to itself... and somewhere beneath that country mile of sparkly-pink frosting is a tiny, skull-cracking nut of impossibly compressed chaos of the [i]take-that[/i] variety.

[imageid=2531956 original]
[size=7]Fig. 1 — [i]Pretty much the exact opposite of this.[/i][/size]

You won't win because you're smart or good at games, but because you were balls-out lucky.  [i]Just like a real wizard.[/i]

In the end this is much better thought of as a party game where the goal is to entertain your friends—throw yourself into it and get that done right and everyone at the table "wins".

(Like other games of this ilk it benefits from being [i]as short as possible[/i] and played infrequently; I highly recommend the "Quick Match Variant" over the normal—and potentially overlong—rules as written.)

[size=7]*Part of a purloined spacesuit with the life support system jury-rigged to freebase PCP, ayahuasca and powdered toad; getting in and out of it is something of a chore, what with the mummified cosmonaut stuck inside.  Well, most of him, anyway.[/size]

Fun, silly, sometimes inappropriate.  Great card game, with tons of possible spell combinations.  Works well as a 2 player game, but plays better with 3 or more.

Each version/release of the game can be played as standalone games or combined for more spell variety.  Each expansion adds at lease 1 new mechanic to the game, which adds new spell tactics.

This version adds creatures, which can be kept either as a "bodyguard" to take damage for you the next time you take damage or can be added to your next spell.

Blood magic is also a new addition, earning blood allows you to add traits, usually more damage, to certain spells.

Also, the Standee now matters.  Owning the standee will let you add traits to various spells.

This version is better than the original, Duel at Mt. Skullzfyre because of the new mechanics, in my opinion.

Now I've combined it with Mt. Skullzfyre I'm going to record all plays against this instead.

I enjoy the crazy combos in this and the tactical element of deciding who to target and when to try and go early in the turn order. It's too long a game really and I just call it when people look ready to stop most of the time.

Do NOT play this with rules lawyers as some of the cards have slightly ambiguous phrasing and they'll always jump on the interpretation which best suits them and you don't want to be referencing FAQs (if one for you question exists at all) every time a player gets hosed.

See Epic Spell Wars of the Battle Wizards: Duel at Mt. Skulzfyre.  Pretty much the same thing with a minor mechanic added in that adds a little flavor without complicating things.  I like to play it as a stand alone however so the cards from the two sets do not get mixed up, as cards from this one have mention of that new mechanic on them.  I suppose you could ignore that part if not playing with expansion rules, but I am a little OCD that way.

This game exists only to let people watch their friends making a fool of themselves as they try reading the tongue-twisting spell headlines in the stupidest voice they can muster, while watching brilliantly disgusting art on the cards.

Good Work!

This is an amusing beer-and-pretzels game, mostly on the strength of its art and theme (which is PG-13). The gameplay is solid, too, since combining spell components is a lot of fun. Sadly, this is very much inferior to the previous installment, since it provides more incentives to knock other players out of the round early. This means a lot more dead players are stuck sitting around, waiting for the round to end.

This expansion and standalone game was a great one! Adds monsters and another mechanic to make spells more powerful by collecting blood off of dead wizards. The mountain/castle standee is now useful as well.

About [thing=173200][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=173200]Epic Spell Wars[/thing] simulates a battle between wizards. It is a bloody thing and the spells are like cornered wild beasts - it will hit anyone on their path. And they have some crazy names.

Wizards must prepare their spells at the same time, and these can be made of three parts: a source, a quality and a delivery. The shorter the spell, faster it will be and quicker your wizard will be able to cast it.

Once there is only one wizard standing, it will be the winner of the round. When a wizard that once was the Last Standing wins again, the dispute will be over and this wizard will be the greatest of them all!

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
Every player has a hand of cards, and can use up to three of them (a source, a quality and a delivery) to create one spell. Each card has an icon, and matching icons will make the delivery stronger. Everyone will make their spells simultaneous.

The first to cast will be the player that made the quickest (shortest) spell. In case of a tie, will go first the player that have the higher number on the delivery card used. If there is still a tie (be because of same numbers, or because none of the tied players used a delivery in the spells), the players roll a die and the higher number starts. Order will follow this way until everyone with wizards still standing has executed their spells.

There is a blood mechanic in the game, which makes possible to spend blood points to enhance the effect of some spells. No wizard starts with blood points, but these can be gained during play.

Spells usually have weird effects, but most will hit one or more wizards and do damage. Every wizard starts with 20hp. If any reaches 0, the wizard will be out of the round, and starts to collect, for each full turn in which there are still wizards standing, some tombstone cards, that will give the fallen wizards some bonus for the next round.

Once a wizard is the Last Standing, she takes a token to remind this, and a new round, with every wizard, starts again. The game will end once the same wizard is the last one standing again. This wizard/player will be the winner!

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
Which cards to use to make the spell - not only for what they do, but also considering the combo of icons (to make the delivery stronger) and pondering about how quick you want it to be. This is very important, as the longer you will have to wait to cast your spell, the bigger will be the possibility that your wizard won't be standing when your turn comes up. These considerations are even greater when there are few wizards standing and the life of everyone is low - while a big fireball is usually better, sometimes all you need is a fast magic missile.

Also, there will be some decisions regarding who to hit. Several times the spell will say to hit the stronger wizard, the weaker, or someone with a creature - and there can be ties for these conditions. It is up to the player to decide which person to hit. However, in many times, this decision was left to chance - by the roll of a die, not because the player couldn't choose, but because going this way, was harder to create an enemy.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- An unique (and, for me, amazing) art style;
- A good sense of (dark) humor;
- Easier to play than expected, considering all the different effects of the spells;
- High interaction between players.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- Has partial player elimination - a person is out of the round (but not from the game) when her wizard falls, and this can happen quickly and the player can be left watching the game for quite a while;
- Can be crazy long - the said time frame of 30-45 minutes [b]is a lie[/b] if you are playing with more than 3 players (and maybe even with 3). Three rounds, in a 6 players game, lasted around 2 hours! And mercifully it ended on that third round, otherwise it could have lasted twice as much;
- High luck factor - coming from the blind draw of cards, the random effect of some spells and several dice rolls throughout the play;
- A player can be out of the round before even playing;
- Worst than bash the leader, due to the random nature of some spells, the game also includes "beat the loser".

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Like in a magic Thunderdome, but when many enter and one leaves. But then everyone enters again, and one leaves. Repeating the process until the same one leaves twice. There is a reason why they didn't do this in the Mad Max movie. It should be the same used to not use this rule here: saving everyone's time. Sprinkled with watching the others play for quite some time.

[thing=173200]Epic Spell Wars[/thing] is not a great game. But it is fun and has laughs and can provide a good time. For a while. Why do some designers like to harm their own games? I can't really say for sure, but seems clear that, if in the game every wizard had around twice their initial hp (so 40hp) and the game was played until there is only one standing and then it is done, it could be a whole lot better. Sure, you could still die before having two turns - but at least one you would have, and probably two also. And there would be no chance for the game to cruise past the 90 minute or 2 hours mark.

Yes, that would make the tombstones mechanic mute and the elimination, final. None of which would be a big problem, specially the final elimination, as the person can leave, if they want to, and if they watch the end, well, that is what they would do anyway.

The humor, of course, won't last all that long, but the gameplay is good enough to keep the players interested after it is "gone". There is a game here, not only a gimmick. But, man, oh man, that end game rule is bad for the whole thing. And to make it a little longer, they added creatures, which absorbe damage. Neat.

If playing by the rules, I simply can't recommend [thing=173200]Epic Spell Wars[/thing]. Too long, too andom, with partial elimination - a triple threat. With some variant for the game to end in one round, it can work and is enjoyable and different enough for a quick play of around 30-40 minutes.

Adds some mechanics which help to fill in the depth vacuum of the original game.  However, games still take too long.  I recommend always playing this, and the original game, on the "quick play" rule set.

RATING: 3.5
I love the artwork. That is the ONLY thing i like about this game. There is basically NO player interaction until everyone has studied their hand for 15 minutes and decided on a combo. Speaking of, the combos can just go off randomly and string several cards from the deck. Too much luck, not enough variety surprisingly, on top of a very pvp heavy take that game makes for a mean, chaotic, un-fun experience. Oh, also, you have to win TWICE.

The added minion mechanic and utility of the tower adds some advantages in the round-to-round fighting.  The blood mechanic as a resource system seems a little much since the life counter could have just been used for pay-to-wound cards.  Being able to mix or play independent from the first box makes it a lot more versatile and keeps the play open for new player.  Still as hilarious and entertaining as the first.

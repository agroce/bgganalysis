Rated it a 3 because the artwork deserves to be recognized. The game itself is derivative, mundane, disenchanting, droll and inspiration-less journey into apprentice level design. Unless you want to be a bad design's guinea pig, don't waste your time with this "wizzers of the wild" adaptation.  

The artwork is so rich and amazing, I wish a capable designer would take the art and create a real game out of it.

Filler muy entretenido con compra de cartas, tiradas de dados. Le falla un poco mas de puteo entre jugadores y tiene un gran componente de suerte (dados y las cartas que salen) pero es bastante divertido.

Fun light card game, especially if you enjoy cards that give unique abilities.  The main game-play is quite straight forward, and the real challenge is in using abilities of individual cards and trying to find combos.  Love the theme and artwork too.  Not something I'd play often, but a decent game, and best with 2 players - can drag with 3-4 players.

See my pictorial review: https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1515721

Described by some as a mixture of Seasons and King of  Tokyo.

Wizards of the Wild, like others already commented on, is somewhat of a cross between Yahtzee and Seasons: lots of different special effects cards that you try to build powerful combos of, and the typical dice mechanism we all love or hate.

While I'm not a fan of either of the two inspirational games, Wizards of the Wild works a little better for me than either. The decision which dice to go for isn't as automatic as with many other Yahtzee variants, and except for the skulls there are no bad results per se. The card effects (and the considerations surrounding them) are a little simpler than in Seasons. That is quite an advantage, especially with higher player counts and players new to the game. Extending the game to a fifth player in the Kickstarter campaign was a mistake, however.

Great with 2 players, and now that I've played it with 4 I think it is best with two. 4-player has too much downtime as there is little player interaction. 3 is still fun as the game goes quickly. There is a lot of replay potential here! 10 different characters to try (in the Deluxe Edition), and each has 2 ways of playing. Plus you don't play with the entire deck each game, so you get different Spells/Challenges at the beginning of every game. I look forward to trying a longer game sometime by playing with ALL of the Acolytes instead of just 7. It's nice that there is no "hand" to manage too.

One of my new favorite filler-type games, and it gets bonus points for being something that my non-gamer girlfriend is into as well. This was a very smooth Kickstarter process, and the game looks great.

A light game that is quick and very fun.  More than a filler but is so quick its hard to place.  There is quite a bit of luck mitigation and depth to the game but with seven rounds it moves really quick.

This is a fantastic, stripped down hybrid of "King of Tokyo" and "Seasons." The only problem I have with this game is the lack of content in the base edition. If you don't have the Kickstarter Collector's edition, the game will wear out after 3-4 plays.

This is a great entry level game for people who hate the simplicity of King Of Tokyo and want to introduce engine building to new gamers. While it is still possible to be a slave to luck, there is a lot of flexibility to get around the dice if you are familiar with the cards.

I only play this solo.  Love the game.  I haven't played it enough to get really good, but I pulled it out again this weekend and have logged several plays.  I'm currently giving myself extra acolytes (turns) both to make this easier and in order to allow time for more combos.  I've found the extra acolytes/turns can help if good cards come out and I get good rolls.  I hope to get this down to the standard number of acolytes/turns soon.

Wizards of the Wild is a light dice-rolling, card acquisition game with a few nice twists. Acquiring Spells and completing Challenges is the main aim but a few extra goals such as bribing the Acolytes (referees) and not acquiring the most skulls each round is also important. 

The game blends all of these elements as well as asking the players how far they are prepared to 'pres their luck' as extra rolls brings the risk of extra skulls. 

A nice game and the artwork is perfect for the family market, which is where this title is pitched.

The art is absolutely amazing in this game. The game play is solid. I don't think I'd ever play it with more than 3 players and 3 players is probably pushing it for me as there can be some down time. However, I do like trying to figure out what is my best move on my turn, while at the same time trying to employ a strategy for the whole game.

Great game . My kids love the art work and the theme. Its simple enough for them to enjoy gaming with me but the game has some interesting Card combos so you can play with some gamer who are not looking for a hardcore game . Its a little bit longer then a standard filler game but that could be because i play with kids.

My deluxe copy arrived today. Big congrats to Crosscut for a very smooth Kickstarter experience (my very first one). Now I just need to play the game to leave a comment on gameplay.

So far I felt a little disappointed with the game. I will definitely try it out more often to see if it sparks a little more enthusiasm. It felt very reminiscent of Tom Lehmann's "To Court the King". Things are inverted in that you can "store the powers" for more regular use. Still, I prefer Lehmann's game by far because all the cards are laid out on the table so the tension is higher and it doesn't feel like luck is a big issue.

Also felt that the interaction is very low in this game, so not sure how more than 2 players is going to work out. Time will tell...

Overall disappointing. Looked great and promised a lot but didn't keep it up. Unfortunately not going to get many more plays (I might give it another go but most likely to trade it away).

I was pleasantly surprised.  There is subtle interaction, risk mitigation, and special powers.  Not all the cards are balanced, but there is enough control for players to mostly average that out with careful play.

25-04-2015. Rated after 1 play. Wizards of the Wild is a cool dice game. In the game, you compete to get an acolyte card, this card is worth some VPs, gives you a penalty for having the most rolled skulls.

In the game, you roll and reroll dice. You do this, to get new resources (mana, gems, skulls). All skulls you roll and reroll are counted immediately and are punished later. You can also roll arcane and tome, which allows you to buy two diffferent types of cards. Tome gives you better abilities, Arcane more VPs.

I kind of liked it. It was easy and fun way to roll dice and do something else as just dealing damage.

RATING: 6
Provisional rating based on just one play.

The downtime in this game with 4 players is excruciating, I can't imagine ever wanting to play it that way again.  However, having said that, I enjoyed the gameplay in your turns - rolling the dice to buy cards to make combos to get VPs - so I'm interested to try it with 2 players to see if it works that way.  There are also some concerns about balance - some of the cards/abilities seem much stronger than others, making luck of the draw on your turn an issue - but we have yet to see if this is a long-term problem.

As a solo gamer it scratches the itch for something light, with enough decision making and randomization to be playable several times in a row. Haven't had a chance to try it out as a multiplayer game yet, so the rating is based on being a forever along gamer.

2 player play is too random and luck driven.  If you happen to have the right card come up you can easily win- all based on luck.  There is tactical play involved in choosing which card to purchase and which dice to re-roll and a few other minor decisions.  Still, with a 4 card selection to purchase from and many, many cards in the game the luck of the draw is too much.  It breaks the game.

A fast paced engine-building card and dice game for 2-4 players that plays in about 30 minutes. Players roll custom dice to acquire spells, defeat challenges, and bribe acolytes. As the game progresses, your spells and special abilities combine in a unique way to increase your power. Dark magic gives you the ability to enfeeble other wizards, but you have to avoid too much of it lest it turn on you!

it's a bit like a stripped down version of Seasons, but it has its own thing going on and its own charm... I love "Yahtzee" style dice use in games and it works well here...

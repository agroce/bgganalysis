GAME: Die Pyramiden des Jaguar
RANK: 3270

RATING: 7
Rating is provisional based on 1 solo play of the game to learn the rules.  Wife interested in playing based on the pictures of the pyramids.  

Update: played a couple of times now (still not with wife!). Brutal thinking game.

RATING: 6.5
This isn't so much a game as a framework for a game.  Contrary to what others have said - there's no luck here.  A rarity for a card game, I know, but you're dealt a hand of 15 cards and that's all you get to play with.  Figuring out the strategies is key, and is the entire game.  It's ALL strategy.  The rule where you flip over a card to determine the end game - that's just stupid and we leave it out.  All that said, it's some good strategy, and will take many playings before we become good at it.  

Traded away.

I liked it.  Sometimes it's best to lose a few points so that your opponent will be forced to advance your explorer to one of the special spaces on the scoring track.  Fun game.

Nothing much of a game actually. It might be worth to play a couple of games but that's all I think. There are better games even in the Kosmos series like Lost Cities for example. Jaipur and Battle Line are two more that come right into my mind so I'm not coming back for this one...

RATING: 5
If you do not like numbers games, stay away from this one.  If numbers are your friends, then track down a copy.  Game play is a series of card plays that fill your pyramid with sequential numbers.  The catch is that each turn you must pick 2 cards which could be played, but your opponent chooses one first and thus decides which of the 2 you will actually play.  The opponent gets the other card.  This aspect of the game works well.  The scoring track and its special actions feels more forced.  [GTI Code: AGSL]

After several games now, I have to say this is a bit disappointing. Maybe the game is simply deeper than I can fathom but there just doesn't seem to be any real strategy to this. Nice components and cool splitting mechanic reminiscent of San Marco but ultimately not something I find all that enticing.

A more complicated and deep Kosmos 2 player game.  The people that I play with didn't like it as much as I did.  The cards should have had an upside down number to in order for the opponents to more easily evaluate each other's pyramids.

Anothe Kosmos 2 player. My girlfriend absolutely loves this game (she's a numbers person). Me, I can take it or leave it. Maybe I just don't play it well enough, she has thoroughly trounced me every time we have played. Edit: played the GF again 12/30/11 and destroyed her! 1 round win (usually our games go 2-3 rounds). Winning strategy: use the power to remove your own cards wisely to more easily complete your pyramid.

A wonderful little game, at first I thought it would be fairly boring---but it's actually a nice thinking game, and very short, which is a definite plus these days.  Great components, with enough strategy to satisfy, even if you can only fit in a small game.

A nice tense game...it takes a few plays to learn how to read your hand and to have others decide to pick the card you want them to pick.  Glad I picked this one up.

I have decided to play a series of hands and 86 the random ending.  Still a great game tho.

RATING: 7
Only played this twice, but we've enjoyed it so far. It is definitely different from other games, which is a real plus in our house. There is strategy here, but also a significant amount of luck. It is possible to win the game in one round if the "Jungle Check" card is low enough (not sure I like that little sudden-death mechanic), but as a result it means I can't see a game generally going more than two rounds, three at the most, which makes it a welcome quick filler. Average rating seems low to me, perhaps that's more a function of the game not having been printed in English? Definitely not a bad game, look forward to playing again.

This is one of those dry, abstract games that you feel satisfied with yourself to actually play.  But in the end, it's just not that interesting, and the scoring path mechanism really feels at odds with the abstract numbers-game.

RATING: 7.5
Only played a few times. Interesting mechanics where you're trying to complete a set in numerical order but you only get to choose which cards are played every other round (and then you get second choice from the two you picked) - and vice versa. It's a vicious game :)

RATING: 6
I find this game original and interesting and I like the artwork a lot; nevertheless, after many games, I still can't figure out a good strategy; every time I play it I feel like I'm making random moves and this reduces the enjoyment; may be I'll rate 1 point more if I get a good way to play it

This is a 2 player game that my wife and I could never get into.  It's the sort of game that you need to look up the rules every time you play because it's not very intuitive.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I can see why people compare this to Lost Cities, because there is a similar bluffing/information management aspect to the game, where you don't want to give your opponent cards he/she wants while simultaneously trying to hide what you have. Deciding where to place your first two or so cards is critical, and can be the decisive factor in whether you win or lose a match. There are a lot of interesting things going on in this game.

I don't like the scoring system, and think the end-game conditions are just stupid. In our matches, the round usually ends when we are both very close to losing, so it feels neck-and-neck until we score. At that point, however, one player shoots far ahead on the track even though it had been a very close match. It gives a strange lopsided/runaway leader feel to the game even though the other player has ample opportunity to catch up. It must be psychological, but it bugs me just the same.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Tactical Rack-O.  Enjoyable.  Don't care much for the "flip a card to see if the game is over" mechanic (I call it the "game end gun shot" because of its similarity to the Wyatt Earp mechanic).

RATING: 5
To me, this game feels a little pointless, maybe because I don't entirely "get it."  It largely seems like a matter of weighing probabilities and having the right cards to force one's opponent to take unwanted cards.  I like the concept of having an unknown game end, but this game can end a little too quickly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
An intriguing game idea.  It took us a couple of plays to understand the rules for ending a round.  It seems like there should be a winning stategy to this one, but we have yet to find it.  Every game has played out quite differently.  An interesting game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Two plays with different opponants: this may be one of my heaviest thinky games. It's not hard to play, but seems to offer optimal performance for optimal brain erg effort, therefore makes me sweat.  Not a lighthearted ha ha ha fun type game, not Battleball, but a game of staring at cards calculating and fretting, thinking, hesitating, rethinking.  I like the opportunity to play a Pacal type basic game with the components.  Something about that Rack-O type number strategizing is fun.  This game asks for strategy in a way that's a little different than most Eurogames - number squeezing. It's not possible to wing it. The true Pyramiden de J. game with the score path and its special powers adds another dimension of thinkiness.  Component quality is good.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
An excellent addition to the Kosmos 2-player line.  Brutal, brutal, brutal!  Don't play this with somebody whose feelings are likely to get hurt!  The mechanism of offering two cards for your opponent to choose one works extremely well.  The window dressing of moving along the path is mostly pointless.

RATING: 3
I bought this game because it was on sale cheap somewhere, and I'm not sure I should've done that. (Yesyes, I know, cheap usually doesn't mean quality, but you've got to take the bad with the good, right...?) After a few plays with the sweetheart, I'm in two minds about this game. The part where you build up the pyramid is quite cool and quite psychological too, with some interesting conflicts and tensions along the way. The part where it is determined who [i]won[/i] the game is not cool: in fact, it's boring and annoying, having very little to do with the game itself, and feeling utterly out of place and simply tacked on for the sake of having something to measure the end of the game with. That's why I simply ignored this part (just as one should do with the bizarre action cards in Knizias Tower of Babel), and just played 3 games in a row to determine the winner. (Later I learned that's more or less what this game's predecessor Pacal does.)

[b]Update[/b] Even with the weird 'jungle test' eliminated the game is not particularly appealing. It is hard to force the other player to create two blocked cards next to each other, and by the time such a situation arises the game is nearly finished anyway. I understand that the original Pacal used cards marked from 1 to 50 instead of 1 to 40, thus artificially creating larger intervals which cannot be bridged by cards with a value 'in between'. The result is that the new installment loses out on all counts: the game as-offered is contrived, and you can't easily turn it into what I suspect is its better older brother. Leave it on the shelves of your FLGS, and don't add it to your shopping basket to break through a ceiling above which you get free shipping. 

[b]Update 2[/b] But of course [i]do[/i] buy it from me. Which despite all odds happened.

Production: Attractive board, explorers, and wooden jaguar stones. The cards are functional, but nothing special; they would be cooler if they each depicted a Mayan occupation, somehow representing the social classes. As is, there is basically zero tie-in between mechanism and theme.

Play: This game is like Racko-extreme.  At times, deciding which cards to offer or accept seems like a meaningless crap-shoot; at other times there are very strategic decisions to be made, both to plan ahead for future moves, and to decide how to manage the movement along the score track.  I enjoy the uncertain game-end condition. (2+1+3) (3 plays)

Racko with a bit more strategy. Each turn you offer your opponent a choice of two cards to place onto his open 'rack' (pyramid), so you always know the cards that he needs and the ones that will hurt him. The 'jungle test' is a silly way to determine the end of the game, though.

Insidious two player game. Players are given fifteen cards each of a 40 card deck numbered 1 to 40.  On their turn they offer up two cards; the opponent takes one for their pyramid, while they get the leftover. Pyramids must be constructed in ascending order of cards, and if this is broken the opponents is awarded victory points.  Add in some special actions and you have an addictive little game.  Good stuff.

RATING: 5
I think this is a decent little game for two.  It certainly belongs in the Kosmos series of games and I'm saddened that the game never saw a North American release.  You are simply trying to arrange a pyramid of cards so that they follow a specific set of rules.  There is almost a 'cut and choose' mechanism in this game but not quite the same as there will only be two cards to choose from.  I think the thing that brings this game down a notch is the random draw off the top of the deck to see if someone has won.  This is easily house-ruled to whatever you want ending conditions to be.

[b]Rating based on - 5+ plays, 2 player[/b]
A game that feels like a cross between The Game, Qwixx and Lost Cities with an 'I choose, you assign' mechanism involved. On your turn you choose 2 cards from your hand and place them next to the board, your opponent will choose one of the cards, place it in their pyramid and then you take the remaining card and place it in your pyramid so that the values increase from left to right, and from level to level. Play goes back and forth like that, and depending on the consequences of your placement you may get to move your explorer token deeper into the jungle where you can encounter events such as removing a card from your own or your opponent's pyramid or removing a card from your opponent's hand etc. At the end of every round there is a 'jungle test' and if certain game end conditions are fulfilled the person with the explorer deepest in the jungle wins! 

Has a nice level of tension (deciding what cards to select, the puzzle of where to place your card, the jungle test etc.) and the game in general has a nice pace and flow to it. Super easy to learn, fast and fun to play, and the jaguar stones are very cool! However, all of your strategy, tactics and clever card play can be negated by a card flip which decides if the game continues another round or ends immediately so the end game can be a bit anti-climactic.

An interesting take on the "Rack-O" system, but uses San Marco's "I split, You choose" mechanic.  This game was just okay for me.  It's not completely random as you can force your opponent to suffer a stone.  You can also look out for special spots on the scoreboard for a special action.  Grade: C-

A decent little two-player hand management game. You try to build your pyramid in order while at the same time sabotaging the pyramid of your opponent. The way this works is that each turn players play two cards from their hands. The opponent then gets first pick, and both have to integrate their card into their own pyramid. If it doesn't fit there's a penalty. Engaging and quick. The game end trigger is a bit odd, though.

The core of the game is like a version of Rack-o with less luck, more choices, more interaction, and a much greater ability to plan ahead.  And it's very good.  The other part of the game is the movement along the "jungle path" (scoring track).  That part is weirder and a little less successful, but it works.  There needs to be some way to get the special actions into the game, but I'm not sure I would have chosen to base it upon landing on designated spaces on the scoring track.

Interesting design, reminds me a little of San Marco in that you offer cards and your opponent gets 1st choice.

RATING: 7
This one doesn't get the credit it deserves in the Kosmos 2-player line.  It requires a lot of thought -- it's more akin to Schotten-Totten/Battleline than Lost Cities or Balloon Cup (and drier than Jambo).  What makes it unique and interesting is the way that out of the two cards you select on a turn, your opponent gets first choice.  It would be easy to pick one card that hurts you opponent, but it's quite another to pick two, with the wrinkle that at least one shouldn't hurt you as much (and, of course, you have to assume your opponent will see which hurts you more).  Plus sometimes you can figure out something about your opponent's hand based on where she plays the card she took.  There's real depth here for such a quick game.

Players attempt to place cards on a pyramid-shaped template in ascending order. When unable to, the opponent is awarded VP.

Pyramiden des Jaguar is a small, abstract, and extremely dry card game. The theme is so pathetically thin, it might as well have been left out. The game didn't grab me at all, and (at the risk of sounding like Tom Vasel) simply wasn't much fun.

It will take considerable persuasion to make me play it again...

RATING: 7
A 'hidden gem' of the Kosmos 2-player games with an interesting 'I offer 2 cards and you choose 1 first to place' mechanism.  These cards are then placed in ascending numeric order, from bottom left to form a pyramid with the ultimate goal being to get ones token furthest along the jungle path.   Endgame rule seems rather...odd...and we do without.

One of the more underrated games from the Kosmos 2-player series. Somewhere in between Rack-O and Lost Cities but more opaque in gameplay. The push-your-luck mechanic of Lost Cities is replaced by playing cards in the right order. After first play this is more interesting than Lost Cities (which admittedly has lost some of its interest with more plays). Too bad that Pyramiden didn't pass the girlfriend test and will have a hard time getting more plays.

Love the Jaguar Stones. Most turns, it feels like some cards are drawn and then stuff happens. Every few minutes, you are able to either pull off a devastating maneuver or be forced into shooting yourself in the foot.

This game might prove difficult for someone to come from behind.  It plays very quickly and easily.  One is trying to stack and place in order number cards from 1-40 or negative effects may happen.

Seems to have a really engaging fun mechanic ALMOST like Medici and Strozi in that you take 2 pieces out and your opponent gets to pick one, leaving you with the other.

Depending on availability, it might be worth considering Pacal (one person commented: "You might like to try Pacal, which is the forerunner go this game and is simply the pyramid-building without the special actions. It makes for a very fun but quick card game. I would think you can play it using the same deck that you have with this game.")

Seems expensive for what you get. About 10 tokens, 30 cards, and a board.

11/20/07 Played once. As soon as I heard about half the rules I said this is nothing but a gussied up Rack-O (a game I played as a ten year old, and which wouldn't interest anyone above about age 12). Hearing the rest of the rules and playing it once left me with the same impression. I kept saying to the owner, "There must be more to this game than this." But... there wasn't. My overall thought on des Pyramiden des Jaguar is "eh". I see no reason to ever waste my time with it again. Oh, and one more thing, the theme is quite silly. Explorers are trying to reconstruct a pyramid in the jungle?!? Uh, I could see them taking the pieces back to their museum and doing so. But doing it in the jungle? Ridiculous!

A vicious, mathy two player game where players are trying to fit cards onto the pyramid (Rack-O) style.  The San Marco method of card selection is used where you choose which 2 cards to play and then your opponent chooses one of them leaving the other for you.  Once you cannot fit a card sequentially onto the pyramid (cards cannot be moved once placed), it's placed over another card, still in sequence & a jaguar token is placed onto the card.  This is when scoring happens and the score track includes some special abilities.  Once a pyramid is filled, the cards run out, or a player is forced to play a card onto a jaguar token, the round and often the game, is over.

On présente 2 cartes de notre main, l'adversaire en choisit une et on conserve l'autre. Il faut les placer sur notre pyramide, toujours en valeur croissante de gauche à droite et de bas en haut (carte de valeur 1 à 40). Si on ne peut pas, on recouvre une carte précédemment posée et on met un jeton jaguar, selon la ligne ou on l'a posé l'adversaire avance sur la piste (seul moyen d'avancer)Les événements ajoutent un petit plus.
Pas un 'grand' jeu mais stratégique quand même (toutes les cartes ne sont pas distribuées) et on essaye d'inciter l'adversaire a prendre une carte et il choisit l'autre. Simple et assez rapide. Juste une partie jouée, mériterait plusieurs parties.

Didn't realize this was a re-hash of the game "Pacal". Players attempt to build a pyramid with numbered cards, and cards must be strictly increasing. During your turn, layout two cards for your opponent, they choose one to put in their pyramid, you put the remaining card on yours. Points are scored by opponent if card cannot "fit" into the pyramid and game is lost if two cards are put in the same spot. Various abilities are gained on the scoring track. Game reminds me a bit of "Take 6" in which you try to estimate where your cards will fit into your pyramid. Light game.

This is a very nice-looking game with quality components.  I also like the concept of the game, and almost even get it--but not quite.  Apparently I will need to play it several more times before I can hope to rise above total mediocrity.  Nevertheless, it was enjoyable enough that I would welcome another opportunity to have a go at it.  There are two things I don't like about the game (besides the fact that I'm no good at it).  1) The fact that your opponent's pyramid is viewed upside down (I would have placed them base to base, myself). 2) The scoring.  As in Liebrary, your performance in each round determines how much progress you make along a pathway, which presents the occasional perk or pitfall depending on where you land.  When you reach a certain point, you've won.  I would prefer a cumulative point system, myself (even though in my case that would be even more humiliating). (4+3)

Excellent and fun 2-player game! I don't know why this game never made it to the American market. It is unique and has a tricky mechanic of making card offers. The components are nice...especially the Jaguar tokens. The game has great replay ability. Another great Kosmos 2-player game.

RATING: 5
A mini-Solomon's choice is provided by one player to the other player each turn. The opponent chooses one card and places it in one of their 10 Rack-o slots, aiming to get 10 cards all in correct number order. You're trying to force your opponent to take a card they can't fit in, and the higher it is, the more points you make. If you can complete your Rack-o first, get more points. You may have to do more rounds if the random game-ender card is low. Solomon's choice is arguably the most boring and non-interesting mechanic in the gaming world, so this game doesn't grab me. It works as a time filler maybe, but the decisions aren't that interesting, there's little tension, and putting out dry old cards and repeatedly doing the same choice mechanic doesn't make it work as a spouse game either.

I love the 2-player games of Kosmos, this one is my 9th game in this collection, of which I found Catan card game and Lost Cities somewhat disapointing. This one though, as expected, is quite nice. It has some broader range for strategy, since both players play an open game but need to speculate on possible cards to be in the game, since ten are left out. So you can't always be sure. This makes for a fairly exciting match which isn't brainless at all. So congrats to Kosmos for a further great game in this overall (some minor disappointments, but nothing's perfect) great collection which I find very pleasing. Way to go!!

Interesting idea of one player offering 2 cards and other player getting first choice of one of them, then having to fit it into their pyramid.

WARNING: Can perhaps become too calculating/mathematical.

Racko with a whole added level of strategy.  The two-card plays, the Jaguar blocks, and the events along the scoring trail makes this superior to that game however, the randomness of the deal can make this a guessing game at times. More plays could easily raise this to a 6.

[Kosmos German 2002 Edition] {couple, adventure; I-choose-you-pick } PdJ is a lightweight couple game. Players compete to finish a 4-level pyramid so that the winner can explore further down the jungle. PdJ uses the "I-choose-you-pick" mechanic, which works well in this game.  PdJ is a quiet game and is not for huge fun (similar fun as Lost Cities, Battle Line and the like). It's not nasty and not confrontational is low, which suits a couple.

PdJ is quite abstract. Its exploration theme is weak. Basically, it's a card-counting game. Thus, it's quite dry if you don't like card-counting games or only like games with good themes.  However, the game length is around 20-30 minutes, which is a nice choice for occasionally play.

Except the icon, there is virtually no other illustration on the cards. Yet, the board is colorful, sturdy and quite pretty. (for a 2p card game, the board is really large.) The researchers and jungle stones are cute and the graphic of the insert is also good.  However, the bits are too small for children.

PdJ is not an outstanding couple game but it's still a nice addition to a 2p game collection for its uniqueness and theme. It's sad that it's not available in English but I also doubt if it will be released in English in future. I really would like an illustrated English rule.

Serviceable hand management game where you and your opponent try to fill up a pyramid with a common set of cards numbered 1-40. On a turn, a player offers a choice of two cards to their opponent. Cards must be placed in ascending values similar to in Musee. You try to set up scenarios where your opponent can't fit in cards without overwriting them. You get rewarded if they have to overwrite or can't play. There is a game end check at the end of each round, which becomes more likely as the game progresses. Quick playing and puzzley.

RATING: 6
A simple game for which I have a hard time wrapping my head around developing a cohesive and consistent strategy for. The rules are really simple: players choose one of two cards offered by opponents to build a pyramid in ascending order. The numbers must rank in order and cards can only stack once. Once the pyramid is completed or the cards cannot be placed, game ends and scoring ensues. With these basic set of rules, I am still having a hard time synthesizing a logical way to play my cards to secure victory.  Not clear if the game is way too chaotic or unpredictable to formulate a strategy or its because I just cannot figure this one out yet. Need to further explore this game to figure it out. However, the scoring track is a mess. I do not like how the game ends abruptly with the "jungle test". Totally unreasonable and anti-climactic. The events on the track is also quite confusing and swings the game around way too much. Luckily, the game can be played a few hands and the winner decided based on the number of points won.

Weird abstract game. The jungle test is completely useless and can be omitted. Also the cards should have had numbers eligible for both players.

One of may 2-player games from Kosmos.

There are better ones in our opinion.

I'm torn with this game.  It's a brain-burner, which makes it appealing to me.  But the theme is meaningless and the end of the game (the inane "jungle hunt") is random.  Plus there's no "oomph" factor which makes it a great game...very "mathy"; not altogether a bad thing, but...I dunno.  Just not thrilled to play it, I guess.

I enjoy the pyramid aspect of this game but found the movement track a bit weird.  Not enough interest in our household to hang on to this one, traded Oct 2005.

After 2+ Plays: This feels similar to Lost Cities with some special powers.  The rules aren't aren't that close, but the two games just feel like siblings, much in the same way as Lost Cities and Battleline feel similar.  I think I prefer Lost Cities, and I know I prefer Battleline, so I doubt this one will see much play.

You need a while to get hang of the strategy for picking the cards. Feels a bit like Flaschenteufel when you try to pick the cards to play. It really is very hard to decide...

Cute little memory game with the added bonus of a cool gimmick for the player who wins.  My daughter teaches this to her friends now.  Ages 6+

RATING: 6
There are clear reasons why The Enchanted Tower is very fun to play with kids. It is fun to the degree that even adults might enjoy it. 

First off, I find the asymmetrical setup interesting. One player knows where the keys are hidden while the the other gets a decent head start in the hunt. This creates very tense moments for both players when the possible hiding places are narrowed down one by one. Both sides also play very differently. As the evil sorcerer you are trying to give away as little information as possible while actually feeding some false hints to the good guy. So, a bluffing element there.

Secondly, the first player to find the key does not necessarily win since the key has to fit the lock as well. After an unsuccessful freeing attempt, the number of possible hiding places is reduced by one, thus creating a dramatic arc to the game as each consecutive round becomes faster and tenser. This is a great choice since, it evens out the impact of luck over a greater span of time and single (un)fortunate rolls of dice do not get to dominate the experience.

Third, you have have to admit that the gadgets in this game are simply cool. Magnets that reveal the location of the key. Locks to fit the key in. And the dramatic fly of the princess out of the tower when freed. 

The Enchanted Tower satisfies a number of most primitive needs of primate species. That is the thrill of discovery, the excitement of racing, the satisfaction from making the right guess and the use of a bit of magic and machinery (=magnets and locks).

BUT, this game is for two players only, despite what the publisher claims. Multiple players taking turns to guide one character simply is not fun.

The designers of these games are great. It's such a cute game, kids love it, and the setup is so easy. The use of magnets in this is genius. Really admire this one.

Along with The Magic Labyrinth, I consider this just outside the top level children's games I own. I'd give The Magic Labyrinth a slight nod over The Enchanted Tower. I say this only because, so far, the kids have always chosen the former to play when given the choice between the two. 

I own the big box edition which I consider slightly superior because of the expansion.

At 2, our daughter is still too young for this one, so a true estimation of her enjoyment of the game is hard to reach. She LOVES the tower and the key and "freeing" the princess, though.

UPDATE (2017): Now nearly 4, daughter still LOVES freeing the princess. Getting a better grasp of how to play "for real" (as she says).

One player (usually one of the parents, but after a few games a switch is possible) is the sorcerer and conceals the key under one of the tiles. The other players (the kids) together use Robin. Both teams must find the key (the sorcerer knows where it is hidden, but starts faraway), moving using the results of a simple die roll.
The team finding the key can use it in one of the 6 locks of the tower, and the first that chooses the right lock and unlocks the princess wins.

The mechanics are simple, but clever and engaging. My 4-and-half years old loved it at first sight!

Another game from Drei Magier wins the Kinderspiel des Jahres (after Magic Labyrinth), and it definitely deserves the prize!

Not as good as the others from the same publisher, but still fun on occasion.  The kids don't request this as much as Geister or Magic Labyrinth.

Great game for kids. As an adult, it's fun to play with kids (I wouldn't play this in an adult-only group) and it's random enough that the kids have equal chance of winning. However, I would consider this to be for two players only.

The components for this game are quite nice with magnets and keys and towers.  However, the game leaves a Lot to be desired.  It is highly random.  It could be fun for the youngest gamers, but my kids (6, 9, 11) are clearly not going to have fun with this.

Pretty decent kids' game.  Like the introduction to information asymmetry, bluffing.  

Ignore the box, this game is only for two players, not 2-4.

Components are *almost* a perfect 10: the keys sit too high in the holes, so you need to lift your pawn to discover whether the key was found or not, but otherwise are great.

Un gioco molto semplice e veloce che si indirizza ovviamente ad un pubblico di giovanissimi, anche prescolare. Non privo comunque di qualche sottigliezza. Se avete bambini da iniziare al gioco da tavolo, assolutamente consigliato. Dopo i sette/otto anni tende a risultare troppo banale. Grafica e componentistica di altio livello.

Really enjoyed playing this game with my daughter. After Magical Labyrinth didn't go over so well I'm glad this one worked. This has the right amount of hidden information for my daughter to work with and the built in handicap worked really well for us to keep the game challenging and fair. In two plays it's taken us all 6 tries each time to find the right spot in the castle to free the princess. Very charming game, very happy to own, and hopefully it gets a lot more plays with my kids.

After a few more plays this is one my daughter continues to ask for and knows the setup and rules, which tells me she is hooked as well. Moving up to an 8.

Ahhoz képest, hogy az van ráírva a játékra, hogy 2-4 fő között játszható, szerintem ez egy tisztán kétszemélyes játék. Hiszen az egyik játékos irányítja a varázslót, míg a többiek Robint megosztva, ami egy embernek sokkal érdekesebb. Ráadásul még az sem fordulhat elő, mint a mi múltkori családi játékunk alkalmával történt, hogy amíg én próbáltam valamilyen irányban keresni a kulcsot Robinnal, addig a kislányom (4 éves) inkább mindig visszafelé közlekedett :). Kislányoknak tetszetős lehet a hercegnő kiszabadítos témája miatt. A Kislányom előszőr mindenáron a hercegnővel szeretett volna lenni, majd miután felvilágosítottam, hogy a hercegnő nem játékos karakter, a boszorkányt választotta :) (aki ugye a varázsló). (2017.04.10)

RATING: 8
Persze nem az enyém, még ha úgy is jelölve: a gyermeké. 
A játék egyszerű, de ötletes verseny játék a hercegkisasszony kiszabadításért, a varázsló és robin csapata közt. De hiába van meg a kulcs: a helyes zárat is el kell találni, ha nem ikerül: újabb kulcskeresés....
Mindkét gyermek élvezte, és a lassan 5 éves imádta is nagyon, de a 6,5 éves fiúnak is bejött. A játékidő: 15-25 perc valóban, pont annyi, amit kényelmesen élveznek.

Wonderful asymmetrical children's game. It says 2-4 players, but really it's only a two player game. The components, art, and box are fantastic. Games take 5-10 minutes and have a perfect pace and tension. Lots of luck, but it feels like the right amount since it's designed for kids and parents to play on an even level.

Excellent choice for kids about 3 to 8 years old, before digging into family weight games like Carcassonne or The Little Prince. This game is even a little bit lighter than Magic Labyrinth, but also as much fun. Some asymmetrical power appears - Mage against others, Mage knows more but have longer path to key. There is quite much luck and randomness involved but not too much.

Hm. The first game lasted about 3 minutes - Robin found the right keyhole on the first attempt before the wizard had even entered the board. The second game was a bit more tense, but I am not exactly enchanted yet.

Update, after a few more plays: The game is broken. My six year old can SEE the correct keyhole. I didn't believe her at first, because I didn't see any differences, but then she showed me. Unplayable, at least with my kids (and I didn't like it terribly much even before this).

Cool children's game. The movement system is splendid. In Robin's team you on the other hand want to move first, but on the other hand you want the sorcerer to move first so that he would give you a clue of the key's position. Could be cool for a parent to play as sorcerer against kids too.

I like this game a lot. Simple, elegant and beautiful. The magic from drei magier isn't as present than in other of their games, but still there.

In Der verzauberte Turm, one player plays the sorcerer and at the start of the game he hides a key under one of 16 spaces on the game board. The other players collectively take the part of Robin, who tries to find the key before the sorcerer can reach it. No matter who finds the key first, though, that player gets to try the key in one of the six locks on the tower; if he chooses the right one, the princess jumps free of the tower and that player wins. If not, the sorcerer hides the key once again, and everyone moves back to their starting locations.

Charming art, great components, and fun theme - all what you expect from Drei Magier.  The girls (6 and 4) enjoy playing the Evil Wizard more than Robin - it's the hiding of the key that does it.  Simple and fast, this one is in the regular rotation, but unsure about its longevity.  May end up on the shelf next to the equally good-looking but ultimately bland Magic Labyrinth.

whimsical, well-produced game that speaks to things that delight -- a magnet on the bottom of the player figure that attracts a key, a princess that springs out of the tower when the right keyhole is chosen. At the same time, it is very much a children's game.

Rated as a kids game. Not really for adults alone.

Basically 2-player game. "Can" be played with 3 or 4 but it's 2-3 players playing as a team then against one. Has been a hit at our house but theme "(save the) princess game" helps a lot. Can be played well with adults and it is rather fun for child when s/he knows something that adult doesn't when playing as the witch. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

[Children's Game] A nifty little deduction/bluffing concept. I can see both the magnet gimmick and the tower gadget being quite exciting for children. 

Regardless of the player count listed on the box, this is basically a two-player game.

RATING: 8
My daughters (eight and eleven) love this game. They played it at least four times in a row when we first got it and still ask to play it frequently (especially my eight year old). Always a hit with their friends as well. Even had a friend's eleven year old and fourteen year old play this game several times in a row.

Hide the key and find it before the witch does.  Finding the key doesn't guarantee a win however.  Use the key to try unlocking the tower that holds the Princess captive using one of the six keyholes.  An unsuccessful try means the key gets hidden again and the game restarts (with a one in five chance of unlocking the tower). 

This was the KinderSpiel des Jahres winner for 2013. Current ranking on BGG is much too low in my opinion.  Yes, it's a kids game but an excellent one!

[i]Obviously this game has been a hit and this is a game my whole family enjoys playing. This is my absolute, favorite children's game.

[i]- Amazing family game that you can play with young children. 
[i]My youngest daughter was almost 4 when she started playing.[/i]
- The components are top notch: the wooden prince and sorcerer and a cute plastic princess with a crown. 
- Beautiful game board.
- The tower: The princess "jumps" out when you select the right slot to put the key in.
- The prince can be played by a few people to help the younger ones remember where you have looked.
- Nice variation on roll and move which involves 2 dice, one for movement and one for which player moves first.
- I could see us playing this with only adults for some light hearted fun.

This game will never leave our collection, I hope to play it with my grandchildren some day![/i]

What a well designed children's game. One player is the sorcerer while the others play Robin as a team. You roll two dice and both move around the board looking for the key that the sorcerer hid, but since the sorcerer knows where it is, he is on a time delay. Once the key is found, there are six locks but only one frees the princess you you must try your luck. Free the princess and you win, otherwise the sorcerer hides it again and we start the search again. The kids love hiding the key and searching for it. Plus the princess actually pops up when freed so it adds that sense of anticipation as you push in the key. A great game for the whole family to play together.

Very good introduction of the semi-co-operative mechanic into a childrens game. The child who played along went really crazy when she won as Robin :)

Superb game which can be played in teams if needed; some deduction and opponent-reading, along with a cool 'princess tower'. Absolute winner of a kids game.

At the moment this is one of the few games I own that can be played with both my 6-year-old and my 3-year-old, as you can play on teams very easily. One team is the evil wizard who has locked up the princess in a tower; this is represented by a plastic tower where a yellow princess figure quite literally locks into a base and cannot be removed. The wizard team then hides a key in one of about 20 holes in the board, and all holes are then covered with tokens. (The key fits into all 6 locks on the tower, one on each hexagonal side). 

Then the Robin team has to move their (magnetic) pawn all over the board, hoping to hear the tiny "click" as the key sticks to the pawn through the token. Then the Robin team takes the key and attempts to free the princess. If they are correct, they win the game. If they are not, the wizard hides the key under another token and the game continues. The wizard is also trying to get the key, except the wizard knows where it is, so there's a bit of hilarity as the wizard fakes out Robin. 

This is a good one. Quick and fun.

Jogo muito bonito, onde tudo foi muito bem pensado (apenas a arrumação dos discos foi esquecida) e cuja jogabilidade é um hino à relação custo/oportunidade. Componentes de boa qualidade, grafismo apelativo, uso da própria caixa do jogo muito interessante e interação entre jogadores a um nível soberbo, apenas a lamentar o facto de tentarem passar um jogo claramente para 2 jogadores como apto para 2 a 4, pois, se jogarmos xadrez em equipas, também dá para 4!

A charming thematic experience for a relatively simple roll and move game, with the usual Drei Magier Spiele trick - magnets. Evil Wizard has locked the damsel into a tower and the hero tries to save her, before the wizard returns. 

It's a game for two teams - 1 evil wizard, other people play the hero who tries to find a key wizard has hidden somewhere on the board. Wizard of course knows where this is, but the hero has a head start. This sets up a neat space for mind games and trickery. Once somebody gets to the key, they try to unlock the tower - one of 6 keyholes has a magnetic mechanism which will eject the princess up in the air (!!!) and hooray for whomever won. 

Firstly the story of the game, the visuals and the flow of the game are beautifully evocative. There is a space for luck, for psychology and thus for exciting events. Girls in particular loved the game. And it's nice that it can be played just with two players, but also more (so, perfect kid and parent game).

A nice asymmetrical game of "guess where I hid the key", easily accessible to even the youngest of players. Playable with any number of players, but best for two. Rated as a children's game, not enough there for grown-ups.

Rated for its age bracket.

This game is stunningly good for children.

Received as my birthday present, 2017!  Wee!  I'm sure I will play this often with our little girl, who was sooooooooooo excited to hide my "birthday party"... then help me find it :)

Basically, this is a modern euro "roll n move" game for kids with deduction elements, plus it is best 2P but ok with more. 

One person plays the wizard who secretly hides a metal key under one of the locations. Players then take turns to try and get to that location using movement dice. The "Robin" player doesn't know where the key is but can use the path taken by the wizard to help deduce the key's whereabouts. The Wizard of course knows where the key is but is handicapped by Robin always having an 8 place head start over the Wizard.

My 4.5 yr daughter loves this game, one that is requested often! She always wants to be the wizard though, prefers knowing where the key is hidden :)

Nagyon ötletes kis játék, grafikája kiváló. A varázsló 8 lépés hátránnyal indul, de ő tudja mekyik mező alatt van elrejtve a kulcs. Viszont meg kell fontolni merre indul a varázsló mert azzal nyomra vezetheti Robint:) Érdemes elterelő hadműveletekhez olyamodni. Na és persze hiába van meg a kulcs, még meg kell találni a jó zárat is:)
Ajánlom minden kisgyermekesnek, szerintem nem véletlenül lett év gyerekjátéka.

[b]Kukacoskodás: [/b]Amire még nem sikerült rájönnom: miért kell a varázslónak egyáéltalán eldugnia a kulcsot?:D De ez már amolyan kákán is csomókeresés;)

The components are really neat, but this game is tedious and boring even for children. The one interesting bit about the gameplay, namely the Prince trying to deduce where the key is by watching the Sorceror's movement, just happens too rarely. The Prince has a head start of eight spaces, meaning he's halfway across the board before the Sorceror even enters the board. Rolling the dice all the time is tedium, guessing the one correct keyhole pure luck. All that glitters is not gold - avoid.

THANK YOU SANTA 2014!


this is one of those games that I still don't quite get but it looks like it takes a lot from the Magic Labyrinth.  Basically I want this so that my son can be an evil wizard, and my daughter can be a princess, and they can take out their anger and resentment on each other in a cute wooden and magnetic package.

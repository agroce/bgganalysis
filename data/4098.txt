RATING: 3
Only played this twice and I am just pulling out of the 'hate curve' of this game.  Maybe its just because I was the only newbie playing in games full of unhelpful sharks, but this seems to be a killer game to be a newbie in.  Expect it to be painful.   Update: played for the 3rd time and I just don't find this game fun.  It doesn't click with my brain the way it does with some people and I find that a huge amount of mental effort is required to play well - and I just can't be bothered.

RATING: 10
If I'm going to give any game a 10 it has to be this. Strategy, tactics, balance, depth, player interaction. It's got everything and all in 2 hrs. The base game has loads of replayability and is worth the rating on it's own ... and then they go and throw in all those extra maps thereby creating such diversity. Outstanding.

The game play is good, but the down time is just way, way, way too much.  Just played a 5 player and it took over 3 hours.  There was 15 minutes at a wack where I waited for the other 4 player to finish their turn when building track.  Just makes this game a complete turn off.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I do not care for this highly rated game.  The economics are too tight, the bidding mechanism is brutal for newer players, it is very easy to fall into a debt spiral from which there is no escape.  And to top it off, I found the game to be exceedingly dull.  I spent all that time auctioning, laying track, upgrading the train, and going deeper into debt just to pick up a cube and move it for a couple points?  What are we playing next?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Auctions, role-selection, tile-laying, route-planning mechanics, and challenging economics (too challenging?) make for a very strategic game.  The only real downside is the terrible rulebook.

RATING: 8
2 games played. I'm not sure this game will be popular with our group because it is simply too long. We play it inside of four hours max but not below 3 hours, which limits the number of different games we get to play in our 6 hours of Friday night gaming.

The game itself is good though, a lot of options, not enough cash, a lot of thinking forward.

The fact that the game is so unforgiving makes this game really fun for me - you're deep in the red and you really need to huff it to make some dough by the end. I'm getting better at reading the board and making sure that the gap is constantly narrowing between income and debt, but still am having trouble reading what other players are up to.

RATING: 3.5
This game is a tough one to rate. It works as written (rules are a bit foggy but the FAQ's clear that up) but as written, it's a hostile, unforgiving, math-heavy game. This isn't a typical railroad game which moves at a leisurely pace and feels a bit like multi-player solitaire. Get 4+ players and this game is nasty and strategically difficult. Hardly a smile cracks anyone's face for nearly 4 hours of play. And when it's all over, your back hurts from leaning over the map  and your mind is fatigued from going through turn after turn of excruciatingly difficult economic decisions. So is this a good or bad game? Gaming can be an enjoyable time socializing, munching and playing a game or it can be "serious face" time where bathroom breaks are infrequent and every difficult decision adds another gray hair. The question is: how do you want to spend your leisure time?

See the GLG variants which help make the game a little more forgiving and a bit more friendly. Oh, and play Volldampf if you can find a copy.
  
After several plays, my original opinions stand and my rating has even gone lower. The game simply isn't any fun. It's a great mental exercise like multi-player chess but there isn't any real railroading flavor to this game. Plus, it has the problem of "runaway leader." You can't play cooperatively to stop someone. And even more problematic, if a player starts in a bad position (maybe gets cut-off early) then its basically game over for him as he'll limp along for the rest of the game. That's a game balance problem. And then there's the wait...calculate...wait...calculate... style of gameplay. 

Honestly, if it was a choice between spending an extra half day at work or playing this game, it would be a difficult decision.

RATING: 9
Brilliant. Low luck, 2-3 hours to play, plenty of tough decisions right from the start as you try to get from your initial loss-making position to a break-even position and eventually a profit. I can see why there are so many maps though, as I feel that (i) each map would play optimally with only a small range of player numbers, and (ii) map variety would add interest anyway.

A brilliantly conceived and somewhat abstract game wrapped with a train theme and set of mechanics that works incredibly well. The game possesses a brutal economic system and bidding mechanic. All of the elements of Age of Steam combine to make this one of Martin Wallace's finest games.

Superb train game with an excellent mechanism for setting playing orders fairly. This is fairly complex, though, and will require a lot of explanations (and perhaps a couple of rounds of play-through) for novices.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Martin Wallace's best economic game.  A turn opens with an intense bidding round followed by laying track tiles, shipping cubes, earning income and paying expenses.  Plenty of opprotunity to jack your opponents.

The only real weakness in the game is the urgency has a tendancy to drop off in the middle to late game.  Players are making so much money there's no threat of financial failure.  Instead it becomes a game of who can be the richest of the rich and the mightiest of the mighty.

Age of Steam is a wonderful game, and less intimidating than you might think. The game rewards careful math and long-term planning, but is very enjoyable to play even if you know you're not going to win. I hope to play many, many games of AoS in my lifetime.

In addition to the official/authorized expansion maps I own, I also have put together these internet releases:

Alpha Centauri - A New Hope: A fun 2-player map that doesn't deviate from the rules, but provides an interesting landscape on which to play. A great place to teach a new player the rules. Apparently this is the first in a series of Alpha Centauri maps that will throw in more special rules as each map comes out. A very cool idea. 

Hong Kong: not played yet.

India: not played yet.

Japan: not played yet.

Northern England: not played yet.

Scotland: This is a very enjoyable 2-player map. It is tight, so don't get crazy with the locomotive. Urbanization can be very powerful here. I would like to try it using the Reunion Island locked action mechanism, but unfortunately I don't know how it works.

Spain: not played yet.

Classic rail roads game. It has two weak points: serious king making possibility and danger of long turn time, especially when at least two experienced players analyse the situation on board.

RATING: 7
I am not a great fan of Age of Steam. There are multiple barriers which lead to this situation: first of all, the quality of the artwork is very poor. It's an important factor for me in the purchase of a game and Age of Steam is not up to my standards (I'm not into fine detailed but an overall flavour and style is very much appreciated in a game). Then, I came to this game a bit late with players who already knew it. This made my first games not that much enjoyable. Still, I've now enjoyed a first (shared) victory at that game. Finally, there is a lot of interaction in that game and it is not always easy to foresee. That added to some complexity in the games itself (calculation, auctions) makes it a difficult game to get into and a long game to play prone to some analysis paralysis. Still, I'm sure it's a game worth working on... I'm looking forward to the next edition to solve some of the issues I have with the game. I can't wait for it.

2011-07-12 (rating 9):

9 for the game itself rather than this particular map.

I just love this game. And it has the "catch them all" expansions feel so there is always something to look for. (Sadly the expansions are very expensive considering components quality.)

I will rate the base map once I play it few times with more than 4 players.

RATING: 8
Complex and rewarding game. The only aspect I don't like about this, is that you have to know exactly how much money you're going to need in the next round (several phases), because you only can get loans from the bank at the beginning of the round. This slows down the game a lot.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
In a way, this is a "gamer's game" par-excellence.  It's deep, edgy and precise.  You needn't bother asking Aunt Maude to play this one after tea, in fact even amongst your gaming friends only the most serious would enjoy it.

I may change my rating as I play it now, but as I see it at present, the plusses here are:
great depth, agonising decisions, cut-throat play, replayability, room for lots of different strategic thinking, subtlety.

On the negative side:
get behind early and you struggle/get ahead and you're hard to stop (in some games of this, it can be a total killer), badly written (though simple) rules, dull art work, a fairly high degree of luck for such a strategic game, some players may think there's no fun involved in it (you won't get smiles just a lot of head scratching).  And it's pretty dry and very mathematical.  The last third is rinse and repeat after setting youreself up - just ship as many goods as you can for the maximum you can make.  That might be something that burns your brain in the planning, but in terms of the spin off at the end, it's pretty dull in terms of fun.

For myself, I sort of enjoyed it the first time, but felt less good about each time I played it thereafter.  I wouldn't say that it was enjoyable as Wallace's other highly acclaimed heavy game - SoE, though it's about as deep.  But that depth is in very different ways, and whilst this is good, it's not one I then long to play again, which I do with SoE.

Having recently played Railroad Tycoon, I marginally prefer that...but I'm not big on that one either.  RT is not as pure, but it's slightly more fuhn.  Actually, I'd say the game where about 80% the same, which makes RT more "AoS midi" than "AoS lite."

RATING: 9
Excellent game, sort of a melange of many different elements of various other games, but fun and deep with just enough of a random element.  Rulebook is not the best and could be improved, but with the FAQ here on the &#039;geek it&#039;s easy enough to work out what&#039;s going on and fill in a few blanks.  The &quot;Puerto Rico&quot; of the Railways set :-)

I really want to play this much more, like most of Wallace's best games (i.e the brain burning ones), people avoid it and go for something like Steam instead but it's the tense, tinkering on bankruptcy, make a mistake early and you are dead in the water sort of system that I enjoy the most. I need to recruit more followers now that Steam has trained up some of the fence sitters in how to play pick up and deliver games, they can try this as there is really nothing to be scared about?!

Qui si entra nell'Olimpo.
Capostipite della "serie ferroviaria" di Wallace (gli altri sono Steam e Railways of the World), è il classico capolavoro senza tempo (qualcuno dirà che si vedono gli anni che si porta appresso..). 

Age of Steam non perdona alcun errore, pena la possibilità di essere eliminati dal gioco (e questo può accadere già alle prime fasi, in seguito a scelte scellerate) e mette di fronte ad un continuo adattarsi al mutamento della mappa e alla situazione patrimoniale propria e degli avversari (grazie al particolare meccanismo dei prestiti da richiedere ESCLUSIVAMENTE prima dell'asta di inizio turno).

Scala diversamente bene a seconda della mappa scelta (ce ne sono decine) e non è adatto ai neofiti (per i quali consiglio il più "soft" Railways of the World)
E' un gioco essenzialmente di pick and delivery, con una cattivissima asta iniziale e una continua sensazione di non avere tempo nè soprattutto soldi per fare quello che serve. 

Mi ripeto: un capolavoro.

This was the most frustrating and painful game I've ever "played."  It was like when you are a small child and your mother gives you some vile medicine -- you know that it's probably good for you, but that doesn't make it enjoyable.  From your very first move, you are in "the hole" and it's next to impossible to climb out.  Just painful, and mind you, I won!

Really good game, but really heavy, and since I played my first game with three people who have played the game many times, I felt really lost and confused. I'm still not certain what the best auction strategy would have been. The scoring at the end of the game is really convoluted as well. It's pretty ugly to look at too. Strangely, despite all of these complaints, I want to try it again asap.

AoS has a very good balance of strategy, tactics, intuition, and optimization. At its best with a group of equally skilled gamers, the game is quite unforgiving.

Enjoyed my first play at 4p. Felt perhaps a bit long, and also that there is a lot of parity and that it's difficult to make inroads on another's position until later in the game. Going first is a huge advantage that is somewhat mitigated by the special actions. The auction can be brutal to take position high in turn order. The diminishing returns from the income track seem like they will inevitably produce scores that are bunched together, as they were in our game. Also some concern about the randomness of cubes coming out (which seems to make the production bonus action close to useless unless you have literally nothing else to do). Still, a fun experience and I'm very interested to see how the plethora of expansion maps change the experience.

Age of Steam is a game full of decisions on priorities, on where and how to expand, and on how much you dare spend.  Oh, and woe betide the player who does not pay close attention to what his opponents are doing. I find playing AoS an engrossing experience.  It benefits hugely from being the fourth iteration of the Early Railways system; a much longer development cycle than is usual. 

Having said all that, the game is not faultless. Management of resources in the early game is absolutely critical - to the extent that there can be no way back from a poor start. The final victory point count of track segments is really fiddly. And the rules, while better than the usual Warfrog standard, could still be better organised.

Great pick up and deliver game. Money is tight. There are a lot of interesting decisions and the game flows nicely. Rules are easy to teach for a game of this weight (on the other hand the rulebook is badly written and can be confusing at times). There are some minor production issues like the colour of cubes not matching the colour of the cities on the board. Some might say that considering the high cost of this game, these problems are unacceptable.

Fascinating game. Fighting the system to financially grow is very satisfying and a challenge that should be found in other games. I also like the planning at the beginning of the game, when you choose your course of action and the general axis of your development. Furthermore the games are different every time thanks to the random seeding of the cubes to deliver.

Everything a heavy euro should have. But it's almost too unforgiving. It's sucks to know you don't have a shot at winning halfway through the game due to early mistakes. As a "gamer's game" I rate it a 9 or so. But overall, I have to give it a 7.

RATING: 9
Wonderful game of building connections.  Unlike many games this rewards strategic planning, i.e. sitting down at the start of the game and deciding where your deliveries of various lengths are going to come from.  This plan rarely survives completely intact, but there is often (just) enough freedom to keep it together (assuming you win the turn order auction at the right time).

Significantly better than Steam, in my opinion, as the production rules in Steam remove much of this long-term focus by making it easier to get the cubes you want when you want them.

RATING: 2
Too many phases and too much going on for my taste. Game takes far too long (about 3.5 draggy hours) because everyone must wait until his turn to analyze all the possibilities. A demon-seed offspring of its enjoyable, playable and fun predecessor Volldampf.

Unlike many I don't give knocks to the production.  Cube control seemed to border on worthless for me on my first and only play, the game took forever with 6P, and I found the open calculations boring and not clever.  Toward the end of the game everyone is bound to try not to kill the other players with AP as they try to figure out what they should ship.  Years later I've now played Steam, which is an improvement for my tastes but still not great.

RATING: 9.5
First play was pretty interesting; I got crushed; one player nearly doubled everybody else in score at the end. Definitely enjoying this already, interesting to see how it feels after a few more plays.

Now that I've played it a bit more, I love the game. More than that, I love how it makes a game system. The base game is great, but different maps make the game amazing without much additional expenditure.

It's loose and forgiving, compared to some other train games, but I think that's okay -- this is a nice game that rewards the skillful play, but won't leave your casual gamer friends feeling completely crushed if they screw up.

The massive quantity of additional maps prove the game out as more than just a game, but as a modular game system -- this keeps the game extremely fresh, yet people playing what feels like a whole new game need only learn 2 or 3 new rules and they're ready to go. Really can't say enough good things about the game and game system, may make it to a 10 in time...

The main problem with Age of Steam in our group is runaway-leader.  Maybe we are not evil enough to make 6ing out the last couple of turns difficult.  With our typical 3 player group, AoS will probably go up with a smaller map in an expansion set.

AoS is an extremely meaty, tight, grinder of a game. The components are not bad for the price but certainly not what I'd consider "pretty", especially with the ridiculously obvious error on the board. When you first look at the scoring board, you wonder how you're ever going to make any coin. But fortunately it is possible - just keep on your toes! The words cruel and unforgiving come to mind. The game is a bit long for my tastes (3hrs) but I prefer this to Volldampf.

A legprofibb lapkák ehhez a játékhoz vannak, azok közül, amit valaha láttam.

Tudom, hogy nüansznyi különbségek vannak csak, de nekem ez jobban tetszett elsőre, mint a Steam. Azonos pontot adok ennek, mint a Railroad Tycoonnak, tudom, hogy nem egy kategória, mert ez mélyebb játék, de élményben kb. hasonló mint az. Ami az Age of Steamben nekem jobban tetszik, az az, hogy fix körös. Utálom a Railroadban, hogy csak úgy hirtelen vége lehet. Ami viszont az Age of Steam gyengéje, hogy elég hamar eldőlhet az eredmény, nálunk a játék felénél már elég nagy összegben lehetett volna fogadni négyünk pontos sorrendjére. A szerencse szerepe az áruk lehelyezésénél nem kicsi, a játék komolyságához képes talán túl nagy is. A tábla elég gagyi, meg abban a kiadásban, amivel játszottunk, a segédtáblák is nagyon puritánok. A neten sokkal szebb felhasználói változatok vannak. Összességében jó játék, máskor is jöhet.
Még egy megjegyzés: megdöbbentő egy ilyen szintű játéknál, ami ráadásul szerintem Eurogame akar lenni, hogy akár rögtön a legelején is ki lehet esni!

A lapkák tényleg irtó profik. Viszont 6 főnél durván szűkös a játék, mindkét partiban kiesett valaki. De bő 2 óra alatt lement. A játék az elhúzókat segíti...

I've upped my rating after a few more plays. This is a tight game (the Ireland expansion makes it worse). An extra $1 bid can be the difference between winning and falling out of contention. Unlike 18xx, the game varies (based on the cube setup), but most of the variation is known ahead of time. The luck of when cubes appear means that everything is not completely known, however. Anyone liking 18xx will probably like this. Perhaps even more. I may up my rating again, once I get to 10 plays. 

[Update] Now that the expansions are out, I've upped my rating again. If you get the base game plus all three expansions, you get 7 different maps for $120. Seven different 18xx games would cost $350 (or more, for kits). This is a great game and great value.

My first exposure to the whole railroad simulation thing was Railroad Tycoon 3 on the computer. When Railroad Tycoon: The Boardgame came out, I was pumped and ready to play the heck out of it. I’ve played it twice. It just feels a bit “dumbed down” as compared to the video game. But AoS, on the other hand, replicates the feeling of RT:TVG wonderfully. I strongly believe that AoS belongs as the patriarch of this somewhat convoluted family tree.

Final word: If given the choice between AoS and RT:TBG, I’ll take AoS every time unless my brain is already so fried that it would be an exercise in futility.

RATING: 7
My Favorite game. I love the great balance between tactics and strategy.  Every turn you have to make sure you have goods to deliver and at the same time build your train network so that you can have longer deliveries next turn.  I love the blocking and rush for precious real estate and the clever moves all around.  The special roles add a lot to the game as people vie for the needed quirks.  The game has relatively straight forward rules for its strategic depth that new players can get into the game within a turn or two.I too, was hesitant to purchase this game because of possible player elimination but it is much a needed check to keep the feeling of someone making foolish decisions in starting a company from the ground up.  A lot of thematic complaints are really unfounded.  Income reduction is the game version of inefficiencies found in larger corporations and taxes by Uncle Sam levied on the more profitable companies.  Goods Cubes are contracts from manufacturers to deliver their products to their retailers.  Long deliveries = more income is the game version of the train company delivering passengers also in those cities and towns on the way to make good deliveries.  Why would the manufacturer care if the train company looped the country 20x if their good is delivered on time?  Like I said, this game is dripping with theme if you actually think about it.  Also take into account the impressive number of expansion maps for the game, you'll likely find one desirable.

Update: Feb-3-2010
Now that I have Steam and played it, I much prefer Steam than to AoS.  The amount of time saved by getting rid of the auction is totally worth it compared to the amount of the strategic depth it provided.  Just ranking it down due to the existence of Steam.

I prefer Railroad Tycoon over this, this is too much cutthroat/punishing for my taste. Too monotonous too. In RT you have similar stuff to this but additionally there are cards to acquire, there are race elements when trying to be first to something, etc. This one is rather bare-bones. And when I want to play something serious I would much rather play an 18xx games which (again) beats this with scope and sheer number of things I can do but at the same time I don't find them as punishing as this one.

Now, I am becoming a sucker for train games, and the whole family of Wallace designs is very enticing...
Age of Steam is a (very) less friendly game than Railways of the World: it is filled with agonizing decisions, and every moment in the game felt like you're walking on a tight rope. If only one of the things you planned for the turn goes wrong, you're doomed!
I still have to decide if I prefer the more casual oriented relaxed gameplay of Railways of the World, or the tightness of Age of Steam.
The answer is probably the latter, but it is easier finding opponents for the former...

for me a perfect game. I like the basic map the least of the 6 I tried so far (other than to-me-broken-Italy), which just means you not only get a perfect game, but the expansions'll make it even better. 

[edit] after getting more experienced I am starting to see more in rust belt map than I did at first

[edit2] rust belt is definitely the second worst map I've seen. it's kinda amazing people got to love the game having just this map in fact.

ohio map: very big map, big even for 6. extensive rule changes, with factories being the highlight of the game. seems it could use small changes to the rules, but overall extremely interesting to play. much more chaotic than korea

Age of steam is probably the best railway game. It's tactical, it's not too long, there's no real winning method and it's hard against hard. A typical game where you want to do more in a turn, but unfortunally you can't. 
Playing this game more and more, it has become one of my all time favourites. In the beginning I liked more the easier Railroad Tycoon, but now Age of Steam gives me everytime a thrill. Fantastic game!!!

The game itself is very tight but that isn't such a great thing being that a simple mistake can end your game before you even start.  Looking beyond that though it's still a great game until you sit down and play it with people that know how to play the game.  

I swear everytime i get suckered into playing this i want to punch most of the players at the table in the face.  It's like playing Diplomacy with people that are just naturally sadistic!!!

The appeal for some Age of Steam players is trying out the sometimes clever, sometimes not so clever changes brought on by the expansion rules/maps.  Age of Steam would probably get really stale if there were no expansions.  I now have a large collection of maps and a set of poker chips.  

My rating for Age of Steam is for the entire collection of maps and my interest in trying out new maps.  Keep in mind that the Rust Belt map would be rated lower than an 8 and certain maps would be rated much lower, such as Netherlands and Italy.  The difficulty level for a particular expansion map can vary widely depending on the number of players and the goods distribution.  

The downside is that AoS has a potential run-away-leader problem.  Unfortunately the random goods production contributes to this outcome perhaps a little more so than it should.  However, if you do find yourself out of the competition early (which I often do) you can still enjoy yourself by playing for 4th or 5th place.

This what I want all of my gaming experiences to be like.  Fast moving, intense, thoughtful, with tonnes of decisions on how you need to accomplish your goals.  The financial aspect of this game is as tough as it comes meaning you need to be really careful with how you spend.  Planning can be deterred by others taking your actions or building where you were going and so on, leaving you to languish.

I've yet to play a game with all experienced players, but I do look forward to it.  This ranks up there as one of my favourite games.  

Play the base map with four or five.

This might be a gamer's game, as there is little luck and lots of possibilities to maximize your points from each set up, but it is also rather long and dry. I couldn't help but be a bit bored and wishing it was Railroad Tycoon instead. So I can definitely understand the high ratings and I would be willing to play again but I would rather plays lots of other things. Further the components are all rather unexciting.

Update: shocked that I once preferred Railroad Tycoon to this! Now I do prefer Steam. Both are good games but Steam I find removes unnecessary comeplexity.

Zeer economisch waarheidsgetrouw spel.
Aandelen uitgeven (niet te veel, niet te weinig) om voldoende geld te hebben om sporen te plaatsen.
Doel van het spel is vooral om goederen in de juiste steden te krijgen.  Naarmate het spel vordert, moet je tevens zorgen dat die routes lang genoeg zijn opdat je dollars voldoende renderen.
Eind van de ronde vergoed je de aandeelhouders en onderhoud je de sporen (beiden kosten!).

TIP: Leg de korte samenvatting bij elke speler; anders wordt het moeilijk om de volgorde der fasen te onthouden.

Toch maar weggedaan omdat ik vreesde dat het onvoldoende op tafel zou komen...

Age of Steam is an incredible game, two hours of brain melting deliciousness.  If you only win one game per year with your group, this is the one you want to win.  It requires a good bit of concentration and calculation, but what Euro worth its salt doesn't?

One of the very best games.  End to end strategy, calculation, and planning.  It plays more like a heavy 4 hour game than the 2 it actually is.  I currently head to gaming sessions hoping to play either 18xx or AoS...

This game has a good balance in having easy to learn rules but a lot of deepness and possibility once on the map. The only random element is the goods placement and this gives a good touch of replaybility, for there is not a fixed and perfect opening.
The expansion maps give even more long term value to this game, being a nice adaption to different player numbers.
AoS seems the definitive 18xx way to german games

Excellent train game.   I do tend to like the cutthroat stock market of 18xx games more, but very tight decisions and a multitude of game options make this a real winner.  Play 4 games of this to one game of 1830.

This game just doesn't seem to have what I seek in a game. It's not fun, it's work. Feels very constraining. Where's the freedom? Where's the fun? Unfriendly, unforgiving, unrelaxing, unexciting, and far too serious. If a game doesn't give me something to smile or laugh about, there's something wrong, and it's not me. Pass.

First two games were chuckers. I'd probably give it one more shot. It would take some heavy convincing though.

Finally played for a third time. I broke even and came in 4th out of 6! That is good for me. The game is starting to make more sense. Seems like the idea is to get locomotive up early without killing yourself in the process. You can't win without a locomotive of at least 5. So get it up to 4 as soon as possible. Watch cities for closing up of hex sides because if there is an open hex then you can probably get to it. Go for cities away from others and with few open sides. In this way monopolize the connections to them.

My rating for this game goes up and down with each play. It's been as high as 8 and as low as 3. Right now its at 5. I'm afraid if I get too geeked to play this that it will blow up in my face. I'm approaching this game with caution.

Played game #4 of this. Felt more in control than ever (had a little good luck too), but it was still a tough tough challenge. I'm definitely getting better at "seeing" the board, where the cubes are going to go, etc.

Game #5 and I feel like I've taken a step backward. But maybe it's because I taught the game and proceeded to play down to 3 newbies. I just can't seem to teach and play well in the same game. Grrr. Was a fun game though. My rating has improved from a 5 to a 6. Sucks, however, when all your plans hinge on getting the locomotive and someone outbids you for it.

A competitive and sometimes brutal game of constant debt! I somehow think that keeping track of shares and engine could be done a bit differently to make the information acessible by all players, maybe individual player mats? The maps are smaller than Railroad Tycoon, which I think is a plus. I also like the discs better than the little fiddly trains in RRT. In general AoS seems an easier game to play in terms of space and logistics (i.e. I find it hard to be sitting at one end of the table and building in the Northeast in RRT.)

I'd played Steam a few times before I played this and they are very similar.  I see the good parts of both games and actually feel like Steam is a better fit for me as I'm not going to play either one a lot.  Steam is a bit more forgiving.  If I were a hardcore fan of these games then Age of Steam might be my preference.

When I started learning 18xx, this system just fell apart in my mind. There is so much to not like, by comparison. I would play AoS ONLY if there were not enough players to get 18xx to the table, a very unlikely event since AoS plays poorly with 2...

A gamers game. This train game by Wallace is deep. I love the fact that the game is modular as new boardmap expansions add varients giving the game a great replay aspect. This is turning into a favorite with each play! "If it's not Wallace it's Crap!"

Update: Not Wallace's best of the system. I find the restrictions on player selections too gaming, mainly the loco action. This one has been rooked at WBCs for years by the Steam Brothers. I'm glad it won't be returning in 2013. They can beat each other up in Canada and save some travel money.

Perhaps it was because I had read the rules prior, but to me, it wasn't a hard game to pick up at all.  The bidding for turn order makes the game.

RATING: 3
A very disappointing game after the massive praise bestowed upon it. Ignore the player scale, this really only works for 4-5.  With three the game loses interaction and recedes into boredom and with six the downtime exceeds tolerance.  Still, that leaves a game wholly unfulfilling and laden with blatant design problems.

First, though I can not demonstrate exactly what mars the turn order auction , it fails as an interesting mechanic.  Second, the role system feels tacked on and unbalanced.  Third, though rarely coming into play, the track-laying rules are quite complex.  Most egregious, however, is the production system.  Random goods placement?  In a heavy game like Age of Steam?  Without the Producer role the game falls into stagnation, yet that role suffers endemic weakness and will likely never appear.  A decent game is buried within, but it's not in this box.  A box full of relatively poor components for the price.

I have really enjoyed my limited plays of this game. It is very unforgiving and tight, but I find that enjoyable with the right group. I purchased a 2nd edition copy with discs. I find the 3rd edition components to be really terrible, but to each their own. A ton of variety and a very flexible and classic game system make this game a must play for any gamer. If this is too mean or difficult for your group, try Steam or Railways of the World which adapt the system and soften a few of the edges.

Good game with alot of thought required.  I think the graphics are very dull (main reason for lower rank).  I like Railroad Tycoon better.  Much easier to introduce to others and has better bits.

Update: Now have played 3 games with the last being a 6 player game with a score of "0".  Was cut off on first turn that cost me big time.  Was lucky to stay in the game.

Update: Now have taken off of my wishlist.  I purchased Steam since it will be more likely played with my typical gaming partners.  I like the stream-lined play of Steam.

Okay game.  It's less cut-throat with 4 players.  Games can get very harsh with 5 and 6 players.  After 3 full games, the debt-building first half of the game doesn't seem as terrible.

Martin has moved this system ahead with the publication of "Steam" which has, arguably, smoothed off some of the rougher edges of this entry in the series. This is still a decent game but I will likely be playing "Steam" much more often now,
------
Meatier and more thematic than the lighter "crayon rails" or "Railways of the World," where the emphasis is on building and operating rail lines with several clever design hooks at work: bidding for turn order and "role" selection; financial planning that requires thought yet without the need for a calculator; track laying skill; planning goods shipment; and, maintenance management.

This game does have a degree of randomness, and can be unforgiving, particularly in the early stages, making surviving the first couple of turns an accomplishment in itself for novice players. Martin gives us a rail game that is relatively easy to learn but requires some dedication to play well.

A number of annoying "quirks" (the blind cube draw Production role, dice driven goods replenishment mechanic, need for the grey disks (sometimes) to mark towns, and the gamey income reduction device, detract from my full admiration of this game, and my game rating has gone down markedly since the publication of Steam: Rails to Riches which polishes the jagged edges of all these things.

For some reason I'm not that fascinated by this game. It might be because some of my friends are real train fetishists. It's a good brain-warmer though, I probably won't (and can't) buy this game, but since three of my friends have it, it's really not a problem. Rating might rise in the future.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Good railway game, but very very unforgiving in the 'early' game - which makes it hard for new players to play with a group of veterans. Some gamers will hate the mechanic for adding more goods cubes to the game (dice rolls).

Shine has come off a bit - at its heart this is a 'nasty' game, it rewards negative play, you want to build track to make your opponents pay more (unless it's costing you more to do it), you want to ship cubes that are in 'shared' cities etc. I find the mental calculations this game needs combined with the 'screw' factor take the fun away a bit.

** Update, enjoyment varies with the map, but I'm getting increasingly frustrated with the Auction mechanic, as it is in effect 'blind' (you don't know what your opponents want, so you have to guess) and it really hurts to be 2nd if your opponent picked the action you wanted ... just not playing it as much now.

Even put the lot up for trade.

** Update - the lot is gone now, and I don't miss it. Saying that I'd play it if someone else wanted to.

RATING: 10
The gold standard of pick-up-and-deliver games.  Players build track and deliver cubes form one city to another to earn income.  The game is brutal in several ways.  First, depending on the map, there are lots of opportunities to block other people from laying track into cities and lots of opportunities to steal cubes other players need to deliver.  Second, money is very tight and it is easy to go bankrupt early in the game.  Managing money and deciding at the beginning of the round how will be needed for the auction and then to take advantage of the special action you'll get because of the auction is challenging.  Finally, the analysis of the map and the cubes in the growth area and then applying it to decide where to build/expand/deliver is deliciously difficult.  This game knocks you down and the better you do, the more it knocks you down.  I've really enjoyed my first two plays and am looking forward to more.

2nd Edition. This might have more replayability if not so long. There is very little if any room for error in this game. Learning curve one of the steepest of any games I have played. I had to be coached on my second play from experienced players at the beginning so I did not drop out. The bidding seems limited in that only two, or maybe three actions seem to be very productive. It is crucial to decide where to begin and develop your own links. Very engaging, but not extremely exciting.

When I first played Steam, I was not specially impressed, but the system did eventually grow on me. Later I discovered AoS and odds are I will never look back. Every part of the game is full of tension, be it the auction, building tracks or delivering goods, and you'd better not lose sight of other players' intentions. A masterpiece I expect to play a lot in the future.

(July 2011) I am hooked on this game. Can't get it out of my head.

Reasonable game but my main gripe with all the Age of Steam and new train games is they actually are NOT train games. They are in fact cube pushing Euro's masquerading as a train game. Give me a real stock market, crashes, epic track construction and ability to own and manage your own company anytime. In an effort to accelerate and smooth out play, all the above mechanisms from the original 1830xx series have been removed. So take your pick which u prefer.

One of the best games I've ever played: interesting decisions to be made each and every turn; need to balance long term stratey with short term optimisation; indirect interaction which feels like anything but; tense and tight economic system. There's nothing better than the relief you feel when you finally manage to get your head above water in a game of AoS.

The wide variety of maps also ensures plenty of replayability.

Great game, I'd love to play more than I have.

I enjoyed the toughness of the game and the fact it was a real struggle.  Our first play was marred by the fact that we had 6 players on the rust belt map, one refused to pay attention during the rules explaination, one went bankrupt in turn two or three and one has a very good maths logical brain so crushed everyone else.

I would love to play again properly, although I feel this is probably not my ideal style of game.  I like games like Powergrid and others (more maths based/logic/strategy games), but don't enjoy playing them with a group who must optimise every turn.  I would like to play again, but we will see...

Update: I traded it. Didn't really enjoy it, and I don't think I probably would 'love it' - there are a great many similarly styled games I would prefer to play (Powergrid, Ys, Hermagor, etc)

After the first (and only one) game I was very impressed; but now (i.e. after several months), strangely, I'm not really eager to play it again; may be too many rules to remember and too much brain consuming; but I can change my mind if my friends will convince me to give it another try; unfortunately the minimalistic graphic doesn't help at all

12/20/05 - 4 plays to date. Great game, I will never get tired of playing this game. Auctions for turn order, exclusive action selection/confrontation, build your own railway lines, deliver goods all wrapped up in one game - there is lot here to like - very, very much.

RATING: 5
Age of Steam is an auction game that's reminiscent of doing your own taxes.  It's not so much a railroad game which is why I much prefer Railroad Tycoon and 18xx as the auctions compliment those games rather than become the point of those games.  If you like lots of brutal calculations and struggling against a tough and unforgiving system then this might be for you. Just keep an open mind and don't drink too much Martin Wallace kool-aid from the Euro-snoots.

RATING: 10
Age of Steam is one of those rare games that is always tense, always inspires the flop-sweats, and burns the brain hard. At its heart, it is a pick-up-and-deliver game with route-building, but it is the auction mechanism that makes the game what it is. The auction determines turn order and a once-a-turn privilege of some type: the ability to move first, or build first, or increase your delivery range etc. Both turn order and these privileges are the key to winning, and money is incredibly tight, so the auction becomes the central dance, the real game-within-the-game.

What really makes the game great, beyond the tightness of the design, is the amount of maps for the system. Because the game is generally rules-light, individual maps add on chrome or change/augment mechanics in ways that completely rework the game without the disruption of a lot of new rules. Some maps change the available privileges, some change the costs to build, some constrain play simply with tough geographical design. There are many maps, and many new experiences, in the system, such that regular play is rewarded with new challenges that nicely don't take more than 10-15 minutes to learn.

This is by far Martin Wallace's best game, and easily deserving of its reputation. I've played at all counts, and as long as the map is appropriate, it scales well. The 2er can be lame, depending on the map, but the Alspach maps are great with 2, and it's worth playing as training for the multiplayer game.

I found the board and art awful.  They really could have made this game more attractive.  I enjoyed the game well enough, and would give it another shot.

I've given it another shot.  There's definitely a game there, just not sure I love it.

Very nice mix of the best of 18xx and the empire builder series.  Build your tracks, move goods from place to place and sell stock to fund it all.

It leaves out the complicated route finding and stock manipulation of the 18xx series and all of the innane and boring parts of the empire builder series.  Throw in a good dose of Voldampf and you have three hours of fun.

UPDATE: After finally coming to grips with this game in mid-2006 (before I was logging plays) ... I haven't actually played since. There are just too many other, much better economic/money-management type games, like Power Grid, 1825, Goa, or now Container. Heck, in all honesty, I'm more drawn to Monopoly after re-discovering it in 2007 (I am now starting the timer on the arrival of the lynch mob). None of these games have quite the mix that Age of Steam does, but all are much superior games (and yes, that includes Monopoly, played correctly and with 4). So down the rating goes.
---
Moreso than most games, Age of Steam is tough to rate. It's definitely a flawed game: the endgame (especially the bidding) is unreasonably wonky, since cash doesn't count for anything in the final scoring; the early game is too unforgiving, and it's basically impossible to recover from a bad start; the theme is basically a paste-up job; and the roles are poorly-balanced, especially (again) in the endgame, where everyone is bidding for the Train and the second-place bidder gets completely screwed. It's definitely a niche game: unforgiving, analytical, and gratuitously difficult.

For all these reasons, it took me a long time to accept Age of Steam at all. But eventually I did, and despite its problems it definitely has some charms. The economic feel - that of constantly flirting with bankruptcy and disaster - is unique. The route management is interesting if completely abstract. The variety of maps gives it an excellent range of experience (too bad the map actually included in the base game is one of the weakest). And it's in a heavier weight class that doesn't have a lot of good entries.

In this category of games, I definitely find Goa and 1825 much superior, mainly because they are more interactive, more textured, better-themed, less grindingly analytical, much better-balanced, and just more fun. But Age of Steam is a good entry too, and despite its flaws, does provide a unique gaming experience, which is worth something. This may sound like damning the game with faint praise, and maybe I am; but it seems to have just enough there to keep me playing and enjoying it a few times a year.

This game is brutal!  One of the tightest games I've ever played, as the slightest mistake or miscalculation can royally screw you over.  Now, I love this sort of thing in a game, where not only the opponents are out to get you (and yes, they will royally screw you over), but the game itself is out to get you as well (and yes, it will royally screw you over).

The numerous maps available for this game also make it awesome.  Every map set has a couple minor rule changes, but results in a totally different puzzle to solve, requiring different strategies.  The base game is pretty replayable as it is, but add in expansion maps and this game stays fresh no matter how many times you play.

It's all done within a fairly simple rule set as well, which is great!  The base rules are simple, which allows the various maps to tweak things a bit without it being complex.

Overall, just an awesome game.  If you like games that make your head hurt a little while simultaneously kicking you in the crotch, don't pass this one up!

Updated 12/3/10.

1 play.
6 players.

Thanks to the Greater Boston Guild for allowing me to crash one of their game nights this month. 

Six players is almost certainly the wrong way to learn Age of Steam, but, despite the chaos, I could tell I was in the presence of a brilliant design. I had played basic Steam once, and I recall enjoying it, but Age of Steam is a different beast altogether. I'm not exactly enamored with pick-up and deliver games, but I love tense ones, Age of Steam's turn order auction, action selection, and share mechanic are things of beauty on that front. 

There were a few drawbacks to the game. Despite my impassioned defense of Dominant Species a few months ago, I still appreciate quality, attractive components and Age of Steam was unquestionably devoid of them. (FWIW, I think we played with the first or second edition). At one point, I overlooked a great opportunity because I had mentally divorced those weird-looking mountains from the buildable area. I'm also not sure how I feel about the random goods distribution and production action, but one play is probably far too little to understand the relationship between those mechanics and gameplay.

I made some really obvious first-time blunders, but I'd love another shot.

Age of Steam is a masterpiece. One of my Top Ten boardgame favourites. Tile laying, tight money management, logistics, technological advances (better locomotives) and competition for various privileges all combine into what is a challenging game without excessive rules or playtime. It's situated in the central ground between the lightweight Zug um Zug/Ticket to Ride and (super)heavyweight 18XX series.

That said, it is not my favourite Martin Wallace game (my favourite designer). I happen to like Princes of the Renaissance even better. Yet AoS is a wonderful system and new boards/expansions have added new twists to the basic game. Of those I've played, the Scandinavian and Korean maps are currently my favourites.

One of the greatest train games. It is almost like work. Hard, long, exhausting, but like other hard level games very satisfying. Shame that it requires minimum 3 well-known with the game players and a few hours to play. It is hard to hit AoS on the table during the week  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A fun euro style train game by Martin Wallace that differs from the 18XX series of games by focusing more on deliveries than stocks. Lots of good expansions exist (with rule variants) that cater to different playing styles and different numbers of players. The basic map is so-so and not very well balanced IMO, except with exactly 4 players. I suspect my rating will go up when I play the expansions.

Note: Remember that you're establishing routes, *not* making deliveries. That's why you get more money for maximizing connections.

UPDATE: 18XX has subsumed Age of Steam for me, although I still think it's a good game. I sold my copy and the expansions.

UPDATE: I'm a philistine. There is much more game here than I thought when I last left it, when in fact I had several plays under my belt. I need to revisit AoS NOW.

I have various problems with total tactical games, especially this one.  I don't appreciate the "I screw you, so you screw me back and screw that other guy" thing.  I like to be able to do a bit more planning, and be able to predict what people are going to do.  In this game, unless you play to isolate yourself, which is rewarded, you are always in reactive mode.  I also don't like the economics either.  If I take out shares, shouldn't I be able to buy them back?  Also, I probably had to take out a loan because somebody stabbed me in the back last turn.  I will tell you that whoever sells the least amount of shares will most likely win, which means they had the least amount done to them.  I appreciate "crayon rails" games more than this, because at least the theme means something.  I mean, I don't know much about railroad infrastructure, but I am pretty sure that more than a few select rails can make it through Chicago.  This game is just tight for the sake of being tight...and that is fine, but don't make the game last 2.5 hours then.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Good theme, tight economy, lots of player interaction, great replayability. It's just a little too long, especially considering the fact that it's pretty easy to get stuck halfway through the game. And i have to say the efficiency of ineffecient routes is jarringly anti-thematic and feels like cheating. I still think the perfect version of this system is somewhere between RT and AoS, so I anxiously await 3rd edition, whatever they call it.

I kind of feel like this game is to me what Puerto Rico is to some other people who are latecomers to the game - a deep strategy game where you can feel left behind if you weren't on the bandwagon early. I have been to game groups and been somewhat intimidated to join a game of obviously experienced players. My friends never really got into this, so I basically just never play it. One day I would like to revisit it in earnest.

Probably the best railroad game out there.  I can see how playing this among experienced (non-over-analyzing) players would be a very fulfilling gaming experience.  Obviously a game for thinkers who probably care more about the functionality of a game, but it would have been really nice for an artist familiar with gameplay to have redone the Income Track display, and even the board, for that matter.  There is something that is counter-intuitive to me about Towns, breaking a single link into 2 more valuable ones, as well as being worth 2 VP or 3 VP because of the way final VP are awarded.

Train games just don't rock my boat. There, I said it. Whether it's stock market games or pick up and deliver games, it seems that those games just don't tickle my fancy. I'm not exactly sure why, but I just find them boring... And I love dry eurogames, but it seems I'm more in the "worker placement" camp than the "economic eurogame" camp. And that's fine, please don't hate me for that :)
Age of Steam is much more unforgiving than the later game Steam, which I like more as it's a bit more loose, but in the broad perspective they both play out in almost the same way with a few notable exceptions.

I've played both games a couple of times just to see if there was something I missed, but I have come to the conclusion that these types of games just aren't my cup of tea. If I'm playing a train game, give me Ticket to Ride (oh, I said it!) or Russian Railroads.

Age of Steam is a brain-burner that shines through with elegant interwoven mechanics.  Every time I play I feel like I just took a final exam and I need to unravel, but for me that is much of the appeal.  I have come to learn that before we sit down to play this, I can't have any beer until around the second to last turn because I need all of my wits to win.  This one is tense, scary, fun, and just plain wicked cool.  Even when I'm getting stomped on I enjoy every second of playing this one.

We've only played once.  It's just so hard to get to the table since you need 4-6 hardcore gamers with over 3 hours to play.  I just got the expansion, so maybe with the Ireland map we can play with 3-4 more often.  I suspect my rating would go up after more plays.

Now played it twice (almost 1 year between plays), and I'm raising the rating to 9.  Really a fun 3.5 hrs.

RATING: 8
Last night I finally got a chance to play Age of Steam and it really intrigued me. I started writing my comments this morning, but decided to post as a review. A game of this depth deserves many more plays before a review, certainly. And I always envisioned my first BGG review being of a game whose nuance I’d really explored. But this game made me want to contribute my initial thoughts, for whatever they are worth, in a more public forum.

In the first minutes of the game, you are confronted with crushingly stressful decisions: How many shares? What to bid? Where to start? And it doesn’t get better from there. I admire this game. It takes a planning and logistics backbone, shakes it up by adding the instability of the action auction, and puts the whole thing under extreme pressure through a compactness of geography that ensures cruel and unusual network interactions. All this in the almost impossibly unforgiving environment of the economic framework.

Every single moment requires that you struggle. You fight for survival in the early game like a drowning man, swimming for shore. Gagging and choking but relieved, you haul yourself up on the beach only to discover that food is in short supply and you’re not the only one that made it to the island.

Inevitably, as I think about the game this morning, I compare it to Power Grid. The relentless jockeying – both spatially and for turn order. The grinding cash planning required to survive multiple phases of a turn while accomplishing all that you need to, given the turn order and needs and opportunities of other players. The sense that there is always someone ready to ‘steal’ what is ‘yours’. We’ll see what happens with more plays, but I believe AoS wins this head-to-head. Spatially, the tactical possibilities seem richer. The asymmetrical needs of players in the action auction of AoS seem to generate more exciting situations than the ‘laggard leads’ method of PG. Cash planning in AoS seems much more unstable – and thus interesting – because of the degree to which other players decisions impact your plans (versus the ‘shopping list’ feeling I get a lot from PG). One area where I think PG wins out is in the players’ control of game length and work it to your advantage. Moreover, this variable game length gives each play its own palpable pace and character.

As much as I admire the game, however, I realize that it may never be a favorite. I’ll give it more time, certainly. And, at least for the near future, I won’t turn down a game. But ultimately, I think this game is too much of an exercise in competitive optimization for it to really shine for me. As such, it seems to be at or near best-in-class. But the heavier games that I have been drawn to (or maybe just dream about) have an emergent brilliance, a strategic ebb and flow that permeates the game, that allows leeway for artistry, for the ‘beautiful game’. So, I’ll end with a question to those that have played more than I: Played by experienced players, can a session of AoS be a work of art?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Just so you know, I rated this a 3 based on the BGG recommended ratings: "Likely won't play this again, although could be convinced. Bad." I don't really agree with the 'bad' part, I just think I don't get it, or it's not my kind of game.

Excellent economic/train game.  My first game lasted about four hours, but it was exciting from start to finish.  I could certainly see the possiblity for some brutal and unforgiving play, but the four-player game I was involved in was really close all the way to the end.  Rating likely to increase with more plays, which I look forward to.  

UPDATE: I increased my rating to a ten after many more plays.  This is certainly one of the better heavy eurogames (or mid-atlantic, I suppose) out there.  It's on my short list.

RATING: 6
Granted, this is after one play, but I don't see whatever all-fired-important distinction people are drawing to say that this is so far different from/superior to Steam. (It probably didn't help that our game was a rather tame affair with minimal fights over cubes. One person was quite a bit behind the pack but no one even flirted with bankruptcy.)

As a result I rate this on a par with its little brother. If you put a gun to my head I would say I prefer Steam over Age of Steam but that's really hairsplitting. Both are good games that I enjoy without slavering over a return engagement, possibly as a result of the very thin overlay of theme on what is essentially an abstract.

This is a very fun 6 player game. I have not tried the expansions yet, but am eager to do so. The strategy is similar to a crayon game, but tiles are placed instead cutting down the time in track laying and making for strategic track blocking. The goods come out randomly which can be a bit frustrating if you are not on the reveiving end of the die roll. However, you can compensate for the luck factor a bit by careful planning of your track early on in the game.

RATING: 10
I haven't gotten to play this as much as I'd like to...but I've been very impressed by the game. I can't imagine my rating deteriorating over time, but I can imagine my game experience getting richer. The typo in the first edition is even forgivable.  Wow!  This game is quickly vaulting up into the top tier for me. There is so much going on.  I love Power Grid, but whereas the turn order mechanic there seems kind of clunky.....the bidding/withdrawal method of selecting turn order in Age of Steam is so appropriate.  Add the 'exception' privileges and there becomes so much wrangling for position and outfoxing your opponents.  I love how the player interaction flows simply and purely from that jockeying for the right to do things.  Money is tight in this one.  

I'm rambling and need to write more coheerent comments sometime, but I'd play this game anytime.  I also found the player aids on the Geek here to be indispensable.  The Geeks come through again!

I appreciate a lot of things about the game, but I think I am just not very good at it. I have yet to see how to stop runaway leaders, and usually feel that I know who will win within a few turns. Still, I enjoy the game and will play when it is suggested.

Wallace's crown jewel. Takes the railroad track building and delivery mechanics, and boils them down into a manageable 2 hour screw-a-thon. Viciously tight money-wise and has a ton of long term planning, occasional auction intrigue, and just works well with its challenging economic system. The first few turns are critical, and having a vision (with back up plans in mind) seems to be the way to go. I was originally concerned that variability of the game might hurt it in the long run, but the burgeoning horde of alternate boards and random cube set-ups substantially change things up so this has not become an issue.

The reason I love this game is because of its tightness. One starts the game in debt, and the entire early sequence is dominated by the desperate need to pull out of the red and back into the black. Depending on the board and the goods distribution this can either be a matter of time (given solid play) or excruciatingly challenging. The need to plan ahead also appeals to me, particularly the pre-auction/round share issuing scheme which makes players really sit down and evaluate where they are and where they want to get to prior to doing anything else in the round.

If there are quibbles here, it is mainly with the initially fiddly rules. The upside is that the fiddly rules *are* there for a reason, balance. Trying to get people used to ideas like non-around the table in clockwise order auctions can take a bit of work, but the payoff is high, and most definitely worth the effort. I find that the towns also can be difficult for new players to fully grok, though again, I also consider them crucial because of the way they affect track building.

Age of Steam, since I first picked it up, has become a lifestyle game for me. My core gaming group loves this as much as I do, and we play it every time that we meet. My secondary gaming groups are also fond of it, and so I also play it with them. There are just so many available expansions for the game now that even playing this game every week, even multiple times in a single day, has not managed to burn me out on it.

This is the king of heavy weight 'pick up and deliver' games, and is highly recommended for people who like their games longer with a hint of sizzled brain tissue in the air.

(Note: the rating on this entry reflects my overall feelings on the game in general whereas my ratings of the expansions reflects them relative to one-another. The Rust Belt is hard to rate because it feels so basic compared to some of the new ideas, and it would likely deserve a 6 on its own merits) which it receives for being solid gameplay wise, but unspectacular in execution.)

RATING: 6
I really enjoy this.  Probably the best train game ever made.  The only problem is the random distribution of cubes at the beginning.  In a game with such a difficult opening (ie working up to the point where you are making more money then you are spending), you don't want to have a randomly generated start.  Players will get hosed.  People will lose before the game even begins.  That's not great.  But in concept, a tremendously good game.

Wow, after several games I realized how great this game is.  Incredibly tight, mercilessly unforgiving, and tremendously rewarding...why bother with nonsense like Ticket To Ride when Age of Steam isn't that much harder systematically to play. Thumbs down to the production- jumbled up goods/players colours, an ugly board, and horrible typesetting!

RATING: 10
So much heavier than Railroad Tycoon.  Lots of fun for two to five.  Haven't tried six players on the standard map, but five was very interactive and thinky.  Three is a pretty open game for the first half of the turns.  I think four might be perfect for me.

Later - played six. ooooof.

RATING: 10
Definitely the best train game out there and I think I have all the popular ones. I may have to lower my rating on the rest just to be fair to this game. There are some similarities to Volddampf. This game adds a fair number of new elements and it provides a very intense level of angst on how to manage with limited resources. It includes actual rail line construction, shipment of goods, engine upgrades, bidding for turn positioning and other elements.

Lots of calculating if you play seriously, number crunchers will slow down gameplay (and its already a long game). Looks like it is hard to stop an early leader. Early calculation mistakes are very difficult to fix. Player elimination might already happen in the first rounds! 

Just updated the rating after a few more plays.

One of the best train games, [u]tight[/u] and brain-burning.
2 player games can be played using one-half of the standard board (without purple stuff and with Scotland map rules or using the 2-Player Variant for the Rust Belt Map) or dedicated 2 player maps like St Lucia, Austria, Scotland, Umbria, Ohio. Untested 2 player maps: Alpha Centauri, Mongolia, Jamaica, Sicily & Malta, Sardinia, Corsica, Hong Kong.

RATING: 8
Great brain burner. Some players will dislike this because it brings more anxiety than fun and the amount of planning needed before starting each turn may cause analysis paralysis to all players simultaneously. It hardly hits the table in my group.
I think that AoS is higly improved by the Steam Barons expansion*, the stock market makes this a lot more fun and agile, taking part of the focus away from the logistic optimization and most of the money-counting burden.

* Note: Yes, Steam Barons expands Steam, not Age of Steam. But come on, this is just a new display of counters for the stocks and dividends. You have enough trains and markers in the AoS 3rd to play it.

I do think the game has some flaws (tough learning curve, defacto player elimination, some components mediocre) but I love this game so much that those points can't dissuade me from giving it a 10.

I can think of no game that rewards creative problem solving any better than this Age of Steam.

Update (2/11): Still love Age of Steam, but since I've gone over a year without calling for it I guess it gets knocked down from a 10 to a 9.  I've learned so many great train-themed games that maybe my hunger for the game has diminished.  Also, with the plethora of expansions ... something I once saw as a strength now just seem to muddy the issue.  Probably need to play again soon to see if my spirits are re-energized.

I love boardgames where the board actually "matters", rather than just acts as a record keeper.  Nowhere does the board matter more than this game.

I found this game easier to learn than I expected, and totally involving from move 1.  The only thing stopping a 10 rating is the possibility of a Kingmaker problem in certain situations.

This is a stratage game but less different between repeated playing in the same map. There is always a better location than others, which might be a little advancetage in the beginning. However, player could choose diffient privileges to make up the gap. I like this game because I enjoy in a feeling of starting a company from scratch and the nightmare of bankruptcy is always bothering in my mind. If you have a dream to do a business, you have better to be good at this game.

RATING: 7
Though this game predates Steam, I have less experience with it and so tend to focus my comparison in that direction.

[b]Comparison to Steam[/b]
At first my main fear was that the randomness in AoS would detract significantly from the game. This is not really the case, since most of the resources that actually enter the game are on the production chart at the outset. The only real randomness is the timing, and given all the other decisions that a player has to make it should rarely be noticeable.

Upon playing, I found out my *real* criticism lay in a different direction. The notion of limiting the number of loans that a player may take is a good one, but the number is much much too high. Players have to be fairly incompetent not to build up a positive income fairly early, and so with 7-8 turns players shouldn't be allowed to take more than 7 or 8 loans (probably lower to be effective). 

On a similar note, I rather like the VP vs. Points decisions in Steam. Having only one track is a bit odd, although the `income reduction step' is wonderful (perhaps not punishing enough though).

As expected, the difference in delivery rules goes in favor of AoS. Although I haven't seen it come up, since players usually do best in this sort of game by scoring max points vs. the field. I have seen a number of situations in Steam where it would have been quite nice.

([i] June 2010, we played Steam with the original AoS delivery rules ::thumb::. It not only makes it easier to teach, but is a better way of playing.[/i])

Unexpectedly, the tile set for AoS is more brutal/limited ( :D ) than in Steam. Unfortunately the prices for laying track or upgrading is more difficult to keep in mind as it is not quite as uniform as in Steam. Also the points scored for track at the end game are stupidly done (per hex each link rather than per link).

Overall, the system is less forgiving of error. You will need a high income to deal with the loans you've saddled yourself with early in the game. This in turn means that you will be suffering income reduction for the bulk of the game. In Steam your economy essentially pays off your loans early, and then you shift to a focus on points. In AoS your focus is to get up and running as efficiently as possible. In AoS it is easy to inconvenience your opponents' track lays due to the restricted tile set, thus lending more importance to the turn order auction. In Steam your focus is on building up long runs to make late in the game, you will almost certainly have a 6-locomotive rating. In AoS your focus is on making sure your opponents have to give you points on their long runs because you will probably NOT have a high locomotive rating.

[i]Surprise Verdict[/i]
The perfect information, no randomness, version of the game (Steam) loses out. Age of Steam manages to be the better game. Though there is a better game out there still to be had. I see no reason that the Production and Urbanization actions in Steam can't be ported backwards and played with the AoS game components and core rules.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
So far, I have only played the game with 2 players. Once you get over the feeling that this game really, really doesn't like you, it is fun to play. In fact, the most important realisation is that the game really doesn't care whether you ever break even or not before it ends; it merely compares relative performance to other players. The only [i]real[/i] threat facing players is ending up with no cash and a maximum amount of issued stock, but most maps are so friendly that you really have to make an effort to make this event occur. There are maps designated in the correct AoS jargon as [i]tight[/i] where you do have be on your guard, though. 

[b]Update[/b] Finally, I've been able to play the game with a larger number of people. There is more contention for resources, and that makes it more interesting as a whole. There is competition for turn order, and for prime railroad expansion. Overall, the game is a nice one, if a bit long and boring for the final 25% or so (on the Rustbelt map, that is). The problem as I see it is that at some point people will obtain sufficient money from moving goods to cover for their expenses [i]and[/i] still have some cash left for extension for their railroad imperium; and from that moment on it's just semi-automatic incoming hoarding, and trying to squeeze as much points out of track laying as possible. Income is far better, though. I also noticed that a lucky dice throw can really make or break your game, meaning there's a bit of kingmaking near the end. That doesn't sit quite right with me: Railroad Tycoon simply does away with replenishing alltogether, and that might be preferable even if it means that railroads become quite useless.

I think Age of Steam is a nice game, certainly one of Martin's better and more accessible ones, even if John Bohrer did most of the development—perhaps that's the reason why it plays better than the average Wallace. All I need now are a few more maps to cater for different amounts of players, and I'm all set for the future. I'm not going to revise the rating, although if you want to, you can read the 7 as a '7+' or even '7++'. The base game is a bit of a slow starter and lacks good options and tension near the end. Different maps may alter this, of course.

[b]Update 2[/b] I've since played the newer edition of the core mechanics Steam, and concluded that to me the way Steam handles points and shares, and goods replenishment, is clearly superior and more playable. (Yes, I am aware that some game scope is lost in return.) See my comment for Steam for more information. As a result, I've downgraded my rating for Age of Steam by 1 point to reflect my updated opinion.

[b]Update 3[/b] I auctioned off this game, and will now begin to look for a replacement copy of Steam.

Great game, with lots of interesting stuff. The auction is really well implemented, and the question whether to issue that extra share or not makes for crucial decisions during the early turns. Money is very tight, but after the first play, it's hard to go bankrupt. And the random setup provides for excellent replayability.

This is a real brain burner. It is hard to believe that it is so similar to Railroad Tycoon from a mechanical point of view and yet feels so incredibly different to play.

The game's mechanics are very simple but the game-based decisions are quite varied and difficult.

This game was a good purchase despite its high price.

RATING: 7.5
The appeal of the game comes from two things: the simple fact that it has a huge following, that it is a classic, "must have" game and from the nature of the deliciously difficult decisions to be made in this game.  I like games where decisions made have real impact.  This is reputed to be one of those games.  2007-06:First play (of someone else's copy) was with three players.  There were a couple of things we did wrong initially, but the game played well.  Have been thinking about this game ever since playing, so that has got to be a good sign.  Am very much looking forward to a second play. 

As this game is just not getting the play it deserves, I traded it to Chris (Qbert) for Roll Through the Ages and Stone Age.

RATING: 6
I like this game but it is teensy-weensy brutal and thus decided to give it a 6.

I like games that are fair and designed so that players of all skill levels have a chance at victory (even if this chance is much higher for the more experienced players). This game fails at that. I've had games were people who knew the rules and had playd before lost after round 1 because the game makes it possible to sabotage them so badly that they go bankrupt and get tossed out of the game. Do we make them sit on the side for two hours while the rest of our group finishes the game or do we just restart everything? Usually it's the latter. This restarting is not fun for anyone. (ok ok, I admit, I did smile when I caused the bankruptcy on purpose).

In this game you need to calculate a lot and understand where to take risks which can possibly hurt you but still not make you bankrupt if the worst comes. Doing these calculations can sometimes take long which tends to drag the game. Thus the game is not very smooth at times. Also, some of the possible actions are just so much more better than others that whoever wins the action auction naturally picks those. That is a bit boring.

The components are ok while not anything striking. There are better games out there with the same-ish theme and mechanics.

Played it twice now (Mississippi & England). As it is very meaty, I enjoy it enough to want to play again. As I am generally not taken by train games, I will probably not suggest it. Rating might go up after repeated play. It is very cutthroat and unforgiving in the first few turns.

Once you get past the crappy rulebook, there's a great game hiding inside.  Money is UNBELIEVABLY tight at the beginning of the game. Your first game of it is definitely a learning game.  But it grows on you.  LOTS of tough choices to make as you expand your railway lines.  As challenging as it is, call me shallow,  but I prefer the more accessible descendant of Age of Steam,  Railroad Tycoon.

One of the best games I have ever played. I like the combination between the abstraction of the theme as a mechanic and the theme itself. You represent a railroad company struggling for make profits by creating a net of rails and picking up and delivering different kinds of commodities between cities.

Truly heavy brain burning game. This is Railroad Tycoon on steroids. A great game about train and delivering goods. It needs heavy foreplanning, and very unforgiving game. You could be entered into death spiral if you are not careful. 

The great things about this game is how you plan your move and track building, into the last turn of delivering maximum length of route. The production part of the game really handled well by some luck, might affect your strategy if you are not prepared.

RATING: 7
Age of Steam is a mixed bag. Its tight focus on income and debt management through board control creates a series of interestingly agonizing decisions. Players will often have to choose between addressing virtually equal priorities, with disastrous results for incorrect or suboptimal decisions.

But at the same time, the game also feels like work; it feels like the system itself, and not the other plays, is the prime antagonist. There are huge disparities in the usefulness of available actions, particularly the overwhelming importance of the locomotive action, which makes the auction relatively transparent and highly dependent on positional elements. Since actual cash counts for nothing during scoring, the auction also becomes less interesting in the endgame, deflating the arc of the game. In addition, the game features a counterintuitive income system that rewards the most convoluted track placement.

But most frustratingly of all, it most definitely drags on for longer than it warrants. For instance, in many cases the first round’s outcomes carry such significance that players will effectively be eliminated from contention on crowded boards, and know it, forcing them to play against the game system to merely keep from going bankrupt. This is not necessarily a bad thing in a tightly designed economic game, if the length is right - but it is a particularly frustrating occurrence with three more hours to go, much of it downtime. End scoring also features one exception to the simplicity of the rules; counting track markers is fiddly and of marginal use in a game when players generally build the same amounts of track in the course of each game, and adds to the length.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Components: Sturdy pieces, clear symbols, and interesting board layout. The graphic design is a bit drab and Armyish, but the game is certainly functional.

Experience: There are several interesting elements to this game, such as trying to build inefficient networks, and despite the game's complexity it is fairly sleek; really the only fiddley part is the special powers toward the beginning of each phase.

I recognize this as a game that rewards careful play, and I think I see what others enjoy about it, but it runs long for my tastes, and I'm becoming turned off from the point-maximization mechanism found in this and other games. La Strada captures all the elements of Age of Steam that I like, but without the length and without a few added layers of complexity; I would choose to play La Strada rather than this title again.

Not a game for the faint of heart. Not a Eurogame stressing equality, this game grows economy on an exponential scale, and many opponent actions can be downright nasty. But this is what fascinates me about this game, that fear of falling into the abyss (it is scary and deep). Winning this game feels like a struggle, a fight for survival. The experience is always rewarding, even if you have to wipe the sweat from your brow at the end.

I've always found this game horribly unbalanced (i.e. if you get a bad start you're never going to win), unsuitable for more than 3 players (there's never enough stuff to go around and there's always someone who gets left behind early on) and it always seems to decend into a puzzle solving contest with all the players trying to work out the most tedious and un-likely routes to get their goods transported.  This is a game that should be fun to play, but you might as well sit and do a cryptic crossword puzzle.

Tentative rating based on one solo play of Barbados map. I can see why this game was immensely popular back in the day, as it's very evident that AoS likes to repeatedly kick you in the genitals while you struggle to generate a positive income. Can't wait to get some real games happening.

Lot's of agonizing decisions to make most of the rounds. Furhtermore, you have to constantly try to out-smart and out-think your opponents.

Artwork... artwork? The graphic design is functional, but not esthetically interesting in any way. 
Another bad thing: this game can stimulate Analysis Paralysis in people. 
And finally: there's a good amount of interaction in this game, but no way of directly harming other players.

Preliminary rating after 1 play. An extraordinarily tight game that never felt boring and was extremely engaging for the whole two hours. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Good brain burner of a game. First few plays can be brutal, as can be extremely unforgiving of early mistakes, and the game is fairly lengthy (2+ hours). Need to have all experienced players to make this game shine.
After 3 plays, upgraded to 9 and may go higher. When introducing new players we have been giving severe warnings about risk of bankruptcy, and also allowing emergency loans at 3 dollars, and restarts of the games within the first turn or two. Ok with this to start, but the risk of bankruptcy places such interesting constraints that I am sorry to lose it permanently. Still, this is an amazing design that I am increasingly enjoying. Upped rating to 9.5... probably make it to 10. Hope so, with the number of expansions I am acquiring.
Update: made it to 10. Formed a monthly AoS group to ensure this gets the ongoing plays that it deserves.

Update after many plays dropped to a 9. The system is amazing, and some maps definitely go to a 10. I would like to see more forced co-operation in the games I have been playing rather than the dominant meme of single player longest route biggest train. My favourite games have been where the winner has NOT had the best/longest route, but helps others  and FORCES them to help him along the way. This happens more rarely than I would like, and why it is no longer a 10. I am interested in 18XX as a result, as I think it provides that sort of interesting mixture of co-operation and competition that I love.  AoS is MUCH easier to get to the table though!

Initial impression is that the game wasn't anything like I was expecting. It's a slightly more involved Railroad Tycoon. While some of the mechanics are pretty interesting I was also surprised by the luck factor on when cubes come on the board. Certainly much more of a brain-burner than Railroad Tycoon.

With Rails of Europe out (the expansion for Railroad Tycoon) I think I'd pretty much always choose that over Age of Steam.  The fun factor is just more instantly accessible.

Played for the first time. Some nice mechanics, but had a feeling that the game wasn't quite finished and more playtesting was needed. Strangely, 3/5 games have been decided by who is given income in the last turn! Gone to a 5 now - the kingmaker aspect struck again - why spend that long on a game just to have somebody decide who wins!

Played a second game after 2 years, this time with 5 players. The first game was with 6. The 6 player game is definitely more tense. Even with 5 players, the players are financially comfortable from the mid-game onwards. Th 6 player game makes it tense and players are constantly broke.

RATING: 7
I used to love this, but lots of plays of the Steam app followed by plays of Age of Steam have convinced me that Steam is a better system. I have never cared for the random cube replacement mechanism, and the ugliness of the game is a factor as well. And the catch up mechanism is perhaps a bit too in your face--if I get a lead I feel like Dagny Taggert being dragged down by the man. Steam is streamlined and more intuitive, and better looking.  Railways of the World also tweaked it into a epic feeling, fun game. Many intense plays of AoS over the years, though.

If God had to give enemas he's administer them in the form of this game. 


A well deisgned game, but with a total abstract feel, lack of nice pieces or graphics, and totally unforgiving economic system its not something I will ever suggest.  The decisions to time factor is pretty low, another negataive going against this game.  I tend to enjoy RRT for the fact it is a tad forgiving. If I want unforgiving economics I'll look at my checkbook.

RATING: 7
Hmmm...  As I play it more, I have to downgrade my opinion.  It's a great idea and I want to like the game, but I think it's ultimately flawed.  There's very little incentive to cooperate, even in a limited way.  It's difficult to hurt anyone other than by delivering their loads, so you try to set yourself up for exclusive routes.  Unfortunately, I think the game plays you more than you play the game.  Perhaps a new board might help...  And there's definitely a "rich get richer" problem with the turn order bidding.

RATING: 8.9
This a game demanding wise balance between taking loans and investiments, as also demands capacity to plan own future actions (as actions from other players) while there is a great interaction between the players for area control and turn order sequence.
It´s not a very hard game to play but it´s perhaps a game hard to be well played. It´s a great mental challenge, a kind of blend between an abstract game and an economic/euro game.
However, visually the game is awful, it really needed some improvments here. New versions of the game ended with the randomness of the available resources, but i think that feature gave an interesting spice to the game, though, of course, making it less clear cut.

A bit too deep and mathy of a game for myself and my group.  I enjoy games that have a lot of thought but I don't enjoy games that severely punish you for doing one bit of math wrong on one turn near the start.

This was a reasonably fun game, and basically felt like a smaller version of Railroad Tycoon, which I also like. Would play again.

Update: After playing this again, I'm not sure what I was thinking or if I possibly confused it with [i]Steam[/I] when I wrote the above comments almost 10 years ago. The money is too tight, and the game too unforgiving in general. The resource seeding mechanism is terrible, and the production action is lame. Too add insult to injury the tiles are only one-sided for some reason.

Give me [I]Steam[/I] or [I]Railways of the World[/I] over this any day.

A hard outer shell with a chewy center. Some players won't get past the 3+ hour play time, the random goods distribution, the mildly confusing board layout (color-matched track tiles would have been nice), or even the basic turn structure, which can be a bit hard to remember (player aid cheat sheets are a must for the first game). Once you do get past those issues you find a very meaty game; competitive bidding, resource management, excruciating decision-making, and varied strategies. It has a steep learning curve, but boy is it worth it. This truly is one of the best boardgames that I have played.

I recognize that this is a very good game, however, I have some problems with it.

1. Track scoring: All the way through the idea is to go for efficiency; getting the most bang for buck out of all your limited number of actions, including laying track. 

Then at the end you get more points for having built inefficiently, for having built more track. You even get points for building unusable tracks that go off to empty towns. 

Why is that? The last turn of looking for a build that has nothing to do with your rail network or the goal of the game, delivering goods to cities, seems particularly tacked on. (The same stupid last turn exists in Brass and Age of Industry.)

2. Why the fixed manifest of track types? Yes, I know there's only so many tiles they could shove in the box, but thematically how is it possible to build a certain type of complex connection and then not be able to do it again? Was the technology lost to humanity? It's part of the general constraining atmosphere of the game. There are so many things you want to do that you can't do. No reason, you just can't.

Normally I like heavy games. I like to dig in and figure the darn thing out. But for some reason I sit there looking at AoS thinking, "Oh, who gives a f@#*?" Maybe it's the fact that even if I do figure it out either someone will wreck my plan accidentally or it will start to work too well and someone will wreck it on purpose.

Elegant and unforgiving economic/railroad game, full of difficult and meaningful decisions.  One of the best games around, and with all the expansions it will probably never grow stale.  It is however, a bit fiddly with the dice rolling for goods growth, and the final scoring is a pain in the arse with all the track counting.  All this has been fixed in Steam, which is basically the same game, but with a bit more polish.

I used to like brutal games as much as I like pancakes with fruit and a cup of fresh strong coffee.  In fact, the first game I spent years designing is one of the most brutal games ever designed.  I learned really quick that only a small group of people shared my love of tricky games.  I wish I got to play this more when I was still a hard core Magic player and before my brain got mushy.

If you like deep games (and you probably do since you're here on the BGG), then this is a great game for you.  If you want something to play with your family, or a fun game to relax into, this is not it.

Oh wow.  So this is what all the fuss over train games is about.  Analyze the board, set your long term plan and a few short term plans, and bid to make sure all of your short term plans aren't shot to hell at the same time.  This is a perfect economy sim; production, infrastructure, long and short term income.  I'm just blown away, but I should have seen it coming since their is a whole genre devoted to this cute little theme.  (Okay, to the mechanics.)  

The one thing that I would love to see added (and I'll look for a game that does it) is a second level of resources.  Ship a blue to a city, and it becomes a purple or something.  The fact that the cubes just disappear left me a little wanting.

Lots of decisions to make in this game.  Combines the fun of bidding, role selection, tile placements, and resource management.  Lots to like about it!  In addition, it plays fast (2 hours for our 6 player game) yet has enough meat to keep true to the theme.  I've upgraded to a 9. Updated...I just like this game more and more each time I play. I'm very stingy with 10's, but I can't deny it...now that I've discovered expansion maps, this one is deserving of a 10.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
While other games can be filled with tension, none embodies tension in my mind like Age of Steam. Almost every moment of every game is filled with this impending feeling of doom as you stand on the edge of a cliff, where a single wrong step can send you hurtling to your doom as other players rush past you into their ultimate victory. 

The reason for this tension is the game's tightness. The game feels like it is actively working against you, and any action the players take that can disrupt your plans can push you off the metaphorical cliff. It is possible to make it so other player's plans are less disruptive to yours (by taking more shares), but in doing so you reduce your odds of victory, as each extra share taken reduces your victory point total by 3 at the end of the game. 

Age of Steam is a largely strategic affair, and it is typical for experienced players to spend a few minutes before the game starts mapping out what the general structure of your track should look like by the end of the game. But this planning is based on an ideal state of affairs, and the actions of other players are usually sufficient to force you to desperately revise your plans in mid-play forcing you to try to juryrig something together that won't result in your loss. It can be beautiful to behold.

Meaty upgrading of the Lancashire Rails system, moving it across the Pond.  Coloured cubes still have to be transported to a city of their colour, upping the income of the owners of the railways used.  However, the railways are now constructed 18xx style.  Money is as tight as ever.  Victory points are awarded for your income and track, subtracted for your issued shares.  Lots to ponder, lots to like.  Very good 2 hour rail game.

RATING: 5
There's a lot to think about in this game - money management, building track, moving goods, map development.   So, in that sense, there is a lot happening and it makes the game pretty involving and intense.  That's an important point, because there is a huge amount of downtime in this game, and it can be very unengaging unless your brain is on overdrive.  The play itself is awfully mathematical and quite repetitive.   The network building is abstract enough that it doesn't really feel like a "train" game at all, it's more like circuit building.   It's also counter-intuitive in that long circuitous routes are better than short efficient routes.  It's well known that the game begins on a tightrope and you can be knocked out in the first couple of turns if you overspend by even $1.   The system works well enough, but I'm surprised that people are so passionate about the map expansions.     I suppose that really gives the game it's life and longevity, however.    Enjoyed it well enough, and would play again, but I'm not blown away - it's cold, mechanical and ugly.   

After 5 years of play, I enjoyed this more than I expected to.  The fact that player colors are the same as the cubes bothered me more this time.  The cold and mechanical elements bothered me less.   I'm pretty sure that I like Steam a bit better than this.

AoS has a great core system, but the game built around it is just too punishingly difficult to enjoy.  There are so many artificial restrictions: when you can take shares, or upgrade your engine, or whatever else you want to do.  Not only that, but there are always at least 2 players wanting to do the same thing, so you have to slit your own wrists in an auction just to get start player or the right to do the thing you need.  Even if you're finally riding high and making money, the game keeps pulling your profitability back.  
Delivering cubes is fine, but I'd rather play one of the friendlier and less-irritating revisions of this than the original.

Age of Steam comes with a game board  representing Eastern USA. Today, there are many expansions available to the public due to it's popularity over the years since it came out. Even some  expansions are made by real Age of Steam fans!

I enjoy the Eastern USA map with 5 or 6 players the most. I find that with less players, it's less of a challenge game wise (not to be confused with less fun). 
Since there is lots more room on the map with less players to build your railroad network and less goods that being moved each turn, there is less confrontation between players railroad networks for certain spot and goods.

It's very tight on the map and it's more aggressive with 5 and 6 players. Specially where move goods is concerned. It can be very important. Sometimes you could lose a game with a certain good is taken before your turn when deliveries are tight. Have the first build can also be a huge factor in some turns.

Now a days I rarely the basic map. Expansions are very interesting for some and is worth a look.

Down graded Age of Steam a 1 point. Rarely play it in Montreal. Play it most often in Quebec City and at the WBC. Doesn't mean it's a bad game, just a lack of interest with Montreal gamers.

Traded one copy.

My biggest gripe with Age of Steam is how it smacks you in the face if you are doing well.  The game tries way too hard to slow down the leader, that it almost doesn't make it fun to be doing well.  I like train games, but I'd rather play either of the other two games in this series, Steam or Railroad Tycoon.  Both of those games also incur bigger penalties for those doing well, but it's more of a tap than a smack.

I like this game because it's very brutal in terms of what the game does to you early on and what players end up doing to each other.  I like the only random aspect of the game has to do with the goods.  I thought I should try RRT but after reading about it, I know that I would just be disappointed after having played Age of Steam since it has more randomness and lesser competition over space.  The main thing I dislike is that you can be in a rough spot in the early game and have to continue with it. Also this game has dated graphic design.  Even the 3rd Edition of the game which has updated design can't compare to games like Chicago Express.

Well, that's what I used to think, but I think it's pretty crappy to make a small mistake in the beginning of the game and effectively be out of the. I do respect the design, but no longer feel it fits my refined preferences.

A great game - perhaps one of Martin Wallace's best...It tends to get a bit unpredictable with many players, but trying to predict the moves of the other players anyway is a lot of fun. Comparable to "Puerto Rico" in the "constant attention drawing factor" - and the rules are even quite simple! Conquered my sympathy by being the first train game I ever fully enjoyed (usually the theme bores me to bits) and made me fall in love with it because I usually win. That's how bribable I am :-)

A fantastic game.  Tough decisions and the early game tension is so palpable, you can cut it with a knife.

Out-and-out economic game. There's a real thrill of building your company and especially getting that sense of satisfaction once you reached the break-even point and it's smooth sailing from here on... But it's an overly serious brain-burner and the pacing is not as tight as, say, a Knizia game. In the beginning, everyone is struggling and counting pennies and then... everyone is blowing their cash for starting player at the end game. I'm also not a big-train game fan so perhaps my rating does reflect that.

Observations after playing the two player variant. I must say that I am very excited about this game and can definitely see that there is quite a bit of strategy involved in it's play.

Have only played Scotland with 2 and Scandinavia with 3.  Undoubtedly would enjoy it even more with more players.

There are just so many ways to punch yourself in the face in this game.  Pretty simple rules, but tough, unforgiving game-play that is just about the right level of difficulty for engaged new players who like confrontation.  I played with my brother, who had never played a modern boardgame before, and he had no trouble getting it quickly and destroying me.

This is a great game that never got traction with my group (though I’m holding onto a copy with hopes that I still might be able to grow a subset group of us). I used to prefer Steam but that petered out due to the simple logistical nature of it and I’ve come to appreciate the risk management exercise that AoS is. 

[q="JC’s Comment"]We can also argue if the randomness is justified, and the question is mostly irrelevant. The use of randomness in the game is a design-intent function that pushes the primary focus of the game back from any tendency it had toward strict logistical planning, back toward contingency planning and execution. In short the random production re-affirms that the central question of the game is not pick-up-and-deliver or even simple execution efficiency but multiply fraught logistical planning. It is not a game of logistical cube movement, it is a game of continuously managing risk on punishingly thin margins -- and if that's not what you're looking for, then AoS isn't the right game for you.[/q]
[q="JC's Insta-Production Variant"]Upon each cube delivery, the active player takes the top cube from the production chart for either the source or destination city and places it on the matching location on the map. If the active player selects an end of the route that has no more cubes left on the production chart, then no cube is produced on the map. Instead a random cube is drawn and put in the relevant empty column on the production chart. In the special case that both columns on the production chart are empty, the new cube is drawn first and the active player decides in which column to place it second.[/q]
[q="Juho's Comment on the economies of AoS vs Steam]Income reduction makes the cost-benefit calculation of taking an extra loan much harder. The loan cap acts as a way of forcing players to profitability at some point, rather than allow them to indiscriminately borrow more and more while below break-even. Because you'll probably run out of runway before that. On some of the tighter maps (e.g. NorCal, London) that struggle to profitability alone can be exhilarating. [/q]

This rating is for the game as a system. The game rules are tight, it's fairly easy to learn, but makes for an incredible play experience. Every move is a tough decision and the variety of maps available, each with their own set of rules makes this a game with A long shelf life. One of my favorites as of today.
If you are looking to pick up this game, look to get the treefrog edition. The plastic trains from the eagle edition really are too large and clutter the board somewhat. 15mm discs can be purchased online from several retailers, but it will generally cost between $18 and $25 after shipping.

Excellent and challenging game where a single early mistake can annul any brilliant plan one could have.  The first 3-4 turns are spent reaching an equilibrium between income and expenses; then ideas of profit can be entertained.  Since money is the focus of most of the early concerns, it seems odd that in the endgame the only real use is to build like mad or bid for a favorable play order position.  The different roles are interesting as their desirability varies greatly from turn to turn.  Keep an eye on that goods display as it pretty much tells you what is in store in the near future.  Good tension, excellent challenge and definitely will hit the table again some time soon.  Minor issues: components are bland for a game of this price, an error on a game map is never a good sign when something that obvious is forgotten; for an avid 18xxer, the luck factor in the Goods Growth phase can be severely irritating, it might seem like a small thing, but since everything has to be painstakingly planned out, it bothers me to no end that a fortuitous roll can create instant wealth for a few lucky players.  As a major peeve, we had a hard time figuring out some details during our first game since some of the rules are not clearly written at all.  In one example of the goods movement a red cube is moved and stops in Cincinnati (which is a blue city) and the income track is adjusted, whereas the rules say that a cube must be moved to a city of its colour.  Links along the way contribute to the income growth, but to do so, the final destination has to be of the same colour.  For a game that requires such attention to detail, I find that such egregious oversights are silly at best.  Thankfully a quick trip on BGG allowed to clarify such problems and we had a really good time our first time around.  I look forward to trying it a few hundred more times.

Wow, I wouldn't have believed it, but I liked this way better than Steam, primarily because there was more planning to be done in Age of Steam.  In Steam, things just got ridiculous because you could totally screw over another player and then save yourself by parachuting some new cubes almost anywhere you wanted them.  It's much easier to gauge others motivations in this game.  Despite the tightness of money, Age of Steam actually seems like the less brutal game since people are much more worried about running their own lines.  You're never going to go bankrupt in Steam but sometimes you'll wish you would.

RATING: 5
[Trains, Pick up and deliver, Track-laying, Special powers] [6P:4, 5P:5, 4P:6] Good game with a simple economic system compared to the usual 18XX. Limited action angst is present. Not a lot of ways to screw thy neighbor. Unforgiving in the economic facet; it's not hard to drive your company into bankruptcy. Six too crowded for the map, seems like four or five is best number of players. *** UPDATE: The random goods placement weakens a pretty good entry-class rails game. It's still a decent game, and I'll gladly play, but I'd never suggest AoS over 1830, despite the potential play time savings. *** UPDATE: Okay, really hate the random goods placement, and since that's essentially what drives your income, it turns this game into something more about getting lucky and less about playing well. Knocked down from 7 to 6. *** UPDATE: Knocked down again due to the annoying departures from the theme. Why am I going around the countryside to deliver something to the city next door? And who's the moron paying me to do this? I really prefer 1830, which makes so much more sense. I think it'll be a while until I play this again, if ever. Maybe the upcoming Railroad Tycoon redevelopment will be the Power Grid to the Funkenschlag that is Aos (i.e., it needs a bit more development). Yeah, the Wallace fans are free to disagree. *** UPDATE: RRT doesn't fix the "more links=more income" problem with the original AoS, so that's out the window. Bleh.

I have only played a couple of games of this (along with a full game on the England map), and I find it a very engaging, rather puzzle-like game that I would jump at the chance to play with anyone willing.  But that is kind of a problem - finding someone willing.  It's definitely a gamer's game.  The look of it probably won't garner much attention from anyone else, and I find it a stretch to call it a railroad game - the analogy doesn't completely work.  But it is an awesome pick-up and deliver game system, fraught with very difficult decisions and a great auction element.  Someone - please play this with me!!!!

I really didn't think this one would be as good as it was.  I was very worried at first that the rule for player elimination would upset things, but now I can see that rule is obviously there just to prevent players taking ridiculous risks and starting again without any real penalty (which is what would happen if we allowed players to do so).  With the elimination rule, players have to watch their tight capital isn't dwindled away on player turn order bids, excessively expensive track building, or careless early engine upgrades.

I expected this game to be less exciting, but it's touch and go all the way.  More plays have pushed this up to a ten for me from nine.

It's great to see a game with rules this simple, yet offering tons of difficult decisions at each step of the way.

I've played this a couple times now and I feel like I've become pretty good at it. Most of my plays have been with 4 people, which seems to play well, though I always feel like the game ends too soon. That could just be from wanting to play the game a lot which is why I give it a ten. It works out great because I have been able to teach the game to relative non-gamers with not a lot of trouble, and they enjoy it a lot.(I'm not cut throat against them when they are new. Don't want to turn them off.) Still not sure if I love this game as much as Power Grid, but they are close to even and sometimes switch places.

Age of Steam, like Power Grid, is a game enhanced greatly by expansions. While I think that I could play the base map dozens of times without boredom, the fact that hundreds of more maps exist is a real draw for me. I'm not really an expansions fanatic per se; instead the draw of Age of Steam (again like Power Grid) is that it's a non-obvious game system as evinced by its proliferation of maps. As my regular readers probably know -- I'm a total sucker for systems.

I purchased this at CANCON 2010, but to  be honest, by mistake (I thought it was Days of Steam - - a very much lighter train game!).  I have subsequently bought and played Steam, which I understand is more forgiving than AoS.  Yet, it is a deemed classic, and maybe some time in the future, it might get a go, so till then, it will sit in archive (and hence be rated 6) (14/9/11).  UPDATE: I simply will never play this game as I like Steam and would prefer to explorer the different maps using this system.  Further, this apparently is a very unforgiving game, and this apparently is just too brutal. So it is gone (final rating 5) (Dec 14). UPDATE 3SF 4.687 Jan 17

I guess I like games with a bit of math, and with trains apparently (I wouldn't have thought so, it sounds so much less exciting that bloody battles). I also like games where life is difficult and in this one you're really only outrunning bankruptcy by a few steps usually, and sometimes it feels like you're just circling the drain. Tough game. But really gripping I find. Mistakes are unforgiving though, so if you don't like planning your turn carefully and making a budget kind of thing, definitely stay clear of this one.

I thought I'd enjoy this one more.  I'll admit, I was in last place the whole game, but I don't think that affects my rating as I could sort of put myself in the seat of the winner and get a sense of if I would enjoy it anymore. I think not. I think the people who love it make excellent points for them and the people who don't also make good points. I'm in the centre. I like economic games, with some heavy thought and intriguing mechanics. I rarely have a problem with auctions and I don't have a problem with them here. But here's the shit: I admit, I made a bad move on the second turn. I built a track where I shouldn't have and it didn't get me anywhere. Here's the problem: at that point, the second turn, I had already lost the game and was 99% certain that I'd stay in last place the whole game. Everyone concurred in the next few turns that there was nothing that I could do to build up "steam". I was forced to rack up too much debt early (or just sit around with zero dollars hoping for something random to happen with goods.) Age of Steam is absolutely punishing. To those who avoid the punishment, it rewards those who count the best and get lucky with the goods distribution. Yeah, not my type of "fun". I would never say AoS is a bad game or a broken game or anything like that. There's lots of goodness here for those who love it. But for me, with so many games, I need to be having fun. Something like Power Grid- another economic linking game- I actually smile throughout it. No so with AoS. It is a mean, unforgiving, stroke the leader sort of game, and I can do without it.

Get out of town! I played Steam before this one and I can't say AOS is better but I like the income track and the loans system a lot more. Although I don't like the use of dice in order to populate cities. Great game nonetheless and I would never turn down a game.

Age of Steam is a game that gets the true gaming blood pumping.  The tight economy, the agonizing decision making and the strong ability to hinder others as you provide small growth for your own rail company lends Age of Steam to be one of Martin Wallace's strongest offerings.  The player interaction is medium, but it never approachs a feeling of solitaire.  My initial rating is an 8 but in all likelyhood, with more play time this one could easily rise.  Less accessible than it's younger brother Railroad Tycoon (not to mention less glitzy) yet it shows the wisdom and grace an older sibling should have by being a better all around game.

I had one try at this game and didn't grasp the rules or strategies. My rails rusted, engine boilers blew, and I was out of the game after the third turn. I need at least another playing to be able to judge the game. Maybe next time I can keep a viable company.  That would be a victory in itself.

RATING: 10
Pretty close to perfect.  It really hurts the brain and forces some interesting decisions.  The random entry of goods is brilliant, the bidding for turn order and choice of roles is fantastic, and in my opinion, leaves a lot of room for differing player strategies.  

Ha.  I'm finding it hard to find more than one or two people who want to play this AMAZING game!  Plays best with 5.

I can see why some people really, really do not enjoy this game.  It can be quite long (unless people go bankrupt) and there is a lot of screwage involved.  But boy - the first round you actually make money, you get a great feeling of achievement!

Played again with five players and it was incredible.  Five players on the original board is the perfect number, providing just enough interaction, conflict and competition for cubes.  I can't wait to try other boards!

I enjoyed the simplicity and elegance of the income / debt management.  I also enjoyed the way in which players could generate income simply by owning key tracks that other players required.  The pace of the game was a bit frustrating (partially due to analysis paralysis of other players).  I also found the delicacy of both the global and personal economy to be dissatisfying.  One player nearly went bankrupt (except for the kindness of another player using his track to run some goods) and at one point the entire game was in jeopardy until someone graciously decided to select 'Production'.

Excellent game, but needs all the group to know the game to get it flying, is hard to get newbies into it.  Makes my brain hurt at times.  We started with the "easy" variant, allowing selling of shares whenever at a $1 penalty if not in phase, which seems to speed the game - less of the mental addition before each turn.  However playing original rules is better once you know the game.

RATING: 5
I can appreciate how other may love this heavy game, but to me it comes across fiddly, punishing, and dry.  It is definitely a brain-burner and I enjoy the roles, but one bad round can exponentially kill ya especially when income is multiplied by 3 at the end.  The colors of the components are really a hindrance.  The player's colors are the same as the generic goods and it is easy to miss a town when it is covered with a gray disk.  I much prefer Canal Mania over this.

A brain burning train gain that can be a lot of fun to play if players don't drag the game out to long by not thinking on other players turns and then taking very long thinks on their own turns.It is sort of a combination of the 18xx game's track layout style, with Puerto Rico's role selection mechanic and its own unique goods setup system.

[b]Age of Steam[/b] [i]Martin Wallace 2002[/i] 
A wonderful system that mixes one of the best auction mechanics in the market with a bunch of interesting and difficult decissions in the actions phase. Just a masterpiece. Its new version (Steam) is also a great game, more forgiving, but I prefer the old version over it because it is more demanding for the gamer, although its production system is less dinamic than the one in Steam. Expansions add replayability to this excellent Wallace design that is only second to Brass. Hard and demanding game that I have been enjoying it for many years and I will keep on doing, may be it is time to add an expansion map to my collection, since the Rust Belt map has been played thousand times in the last five years...

Age of Steam is unrealistic and confusing for beginners.  If you get your economy going early, you will do well.  In fact you'll probably win.  How your economy gets going is quite irrational.  In the end the scores will look close, thanks to the income-levelling of the game.  In reality, whoever gets a good early run will win.  My recent experience was of a good relaxing night tarnished by playing a board game with inane rules.  To start with you are hamstrung by your economy (you actually go backwards despite the fact that you haven't bought anything yet; also, shares that you buy can never be sold - they just cost you money forever; when other people have built railway track, you can't build there too -- we are talking about track separated by many kilometers/miles; if you use other players' track you pay them all the benefits that you would have received from using the track anyway; when one railway business buys an engine, no one else is allowed to buy one???  What? - is there one manufacturer and they only churn out one engine from their factory per turn??  So unrealistic).  When your economy gets going money counts for nothing because you have vastly more than you need and nothing to do with it than bid for turn order.  Why waste your time playing this?  Have a lemonade and talk about something productive or do some exercise.  Thanks for the introduction to this game, but there are plenty of games where you have a real chance based on skill and not on how many people steal the resources you want to use.  A big thumbs down for this game.  Not recommended.

An intense, cutthroat economic game with a small splash of luck.  It has only gotten better and better as I've played it more, and the expansions have really helped it avoid growing stale.

An interesting pick up and deliver game where the most interesting thing is the different actions you bid for and the different choices you have during a turn. It’s tight, but not as brutal as some players report.

I really don't dislike the rust belt map, but at the same time I don't find anything that I really like with it either. It just feels so vanilla as there are no real quirks with it and the cubes are distributed so evenly. The games I have played with it have turned out to be pretty even though. I think I prefer to play the map with four players. There isn't enough tension with three players.

Played twice, one a six-player face-to-face game and the other a PBEM game on a homebrew map. Certainly it's a nice design, but it's not really my type of thing; outside of two-player abstracts I'm not a fan of perfect-information games, and overall I find the game to be far too nasty and unforgiving for my taste. Still, I'd be willing to play again.

It's not the prettiest game in my collection, but play is deep and rewarding. Simple systems combine in unexpected ways ... it takes a game or two before you see everything that is going on. Suggest you allow each player a mulligan as you learn, as starting positions can be fragile, and inexperienced players can go bankrupt in a hurry. I'm no damn good at this game, but I sure have fun losing at it. I have more fun losing at Age of Steam than I do when winning many a lesser game. It remains a favorite after a dozen plays and I am confident I will continue to enjoy this game for years to come.

4-player for the original map (all maps have a particular player count in mind; only a small amount of research here will find you that number).

Touchstones: Tight money; Plotting the turn order; Deficit spending; An austere pick-up and deliver; Curious and unique auction; Predictable resupply of cubes; Sharp rule set.

This game responds to extortion by pushing someone to spend crucial dollars.

I'm torn. Age of Steam is mostly a great game -- I like most everything it does. It's very meaty and (seemingly) rewards thoughtful play (i.e., it can be a brain-burner). However, this weight is let down by the end-game where kingmaking raises its ugly head.

Players can usually choose whom they help when transporting cubes. Too often this leads to deciding who wins the game. Most multi-player games suffer this to some degree but it's very pronounced in Age of Steam and especially egregious because of its heaviness. Why bother devoting all that effort if the result is a popularity contest?

Came up with a 2 player Scotland map that gets some praise here but it's fairly crude.

RATING: 7
Was warned about the unforgiving nature of the game so my wife and I first played the game by taking two colours each and playing like they were teams.  Team play is actually pretty interesting.  Playing to have the most total victory points on your team is better than trying to have the colour with the most victory points, because you are less likely to sacrifice one colour to kingmake the other.

Playing two colours does three things to the game:

1. Player elimination does not kill the fun.  You still have one colour to play, and the game then becomes how well can you place among the remaining colours, even though you likely won't win.

2. You can take advantage of having colours that help one another.  You take moves where your first colour gets 2 income and your second colour gets 2 income, which you might avoid in a normal game so as to not give too much income to another colour.

3. Less blocking moves.  Tracks are likely much less criss-crossing because there is one less colour to block the best paths into a city.

The first point is likely the most significant, which is why my wife and I are most likely to play this game as a two colour each "team game"  and introduce it that way to third players.
Still, I would not hesitate to jump into a regular game with experienced players now that I have a feel for the game.

I understand why this game has so many high ratings.  For me, I'm just not a train-game fan, and other themes are more interesting to me.  It is a very solid game, and I recommend others try it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Brutally unforgiving economic, tile placement and pickup& delivery game, with a well done railway theme. Mistakes in the early turns are almost entirely unrecoverable, but make a decent start and this becomes a fascinating strategic battle to outmaneuver and outperform the other players. Competition is incredibly fierce and the smell of frazzled braincells fills the air by the time the game is over.

The first time I played, I was completely destroyed by Geoff Brown, and one of the other Warfrogs... and I was like 'Eh? WTF!!! How do I do this?? By my second game, against more normal but still pretty experienced players I was more up to speed and actually won the game. A good start is essential though.

Huh, can't believe I haven't yet rated one of my most played games yet, I just assumed I threw it a perfect score already.  This is one of the pinnacles of the train game genre, which is quite saturated in fantastic games.  I'd take off a point for the cube distribution uncertainty in the base game, but so many maps tweak this that the point is long moot.

The newer Steam is a fine game for people who prefer that kind of thing.  But nothing beats the original.  A great work-out for the brain.

Needlessly brutal. I mean, does Martin Wallace hate us? I have played lots of games where the system fights you and dares you, mockingly, to score any points--but AoS brings it to a whole new level. It feels as though someone is punching you in the gonads over and over for the first few turns. 
That having been said, it's a very tight game; a bit too much like a puzzle for my tastes, but a very tight game.

Elegant and relatively simple to teach train game.  Of course, saying it's relatively simple to teach doesn't mean that it's easy to develop a winning strategy.  Lots of short links seem to be the way to go, and the only spot on the board to do this is smack in the middle...so whoever gets that spot... Looking to play this more, so far only experienced 4 player game, any more players and I think the board would be ultra tight.

Good game, a bit long, but that might have been because we're inexperienced (1st round of 1st game took 1h, whole game clocked in at 4h15). A second play using the Scandinavian map went just a little bit faster, but there is still a little something missing I think from making this a great game as opposed to just a good one. Later games have improved my impression of it: now up to 5 plays, but still over 3h/game which I think is a little too much for it to see regular play.

Although the rules are not too difficult it's a demanding game. The money management is challenging. In two of the three games I have played one player crashed out of the game bust - it's easily done in this cut throat game. Railroad Tycoon is a bit lighter and more forgiving because it doesn't let you go bust.

RATING: 7
Punishing for a first time player, very difficult to approach and play on the first turn. After that however, decisions are constantly interesting, the auction is interesting, though I am undecided whether I like it. Track laying is vicious and fun, felt like a much more key element of the game than 1830. The cube display was confusing and ate up a fair bit of time looking at it and wondering what was coming and trying to calculate. Overall, lots of good pieces, but could be so much more elegant.

Brutal but fun game... you start in debt, and get further into debt the longer you play, with no hope of buying debt back!  But despite that, it's a fun challenge (though not for the faint-hearted).  This game desperately needs computerization; it takes too much effort to figure out which goods can be delivered by yourself (and sometimes other players, because you definitely want to steal their goods before they can deliver them).

I've played this with 3 players, and it's still quite competitive and lots of fun.  4 players is a good number, 5 is pretty tight, and 6 is insane (never tried it).

I like this game well enough, but it's very unforgiving for new players, as it's not hard to go bankrupt. In fact, that's probably my biggest issue with AoS - I'm not a fan of games that eliminate players. However, it's the next step up from T2R but not as complex as 18XX.

RATING: 3
Finally got to play my first game with the correct rules!  Nice components, and although I like economic games, this one simply did not work for me, as I found myself playing last way too often (6 turns out of 8!).  Not being able to afford to stay in the bidding race essentially meant that the game was already over, as the only available options would not help me catch up with the leaders.  Would work better if it used a system such as POWER GRID, where the last player gets to choose first.

Do note that I played with experienced players, and we had a runaway leader.  By turn 4 the game was already decided, so the last hour+ was pointless.  The bidding for the turn order killed it for me, and the randomness of the goods draw did not help.  Rating reflects the fact that I am not interested in playing this again.  If you have the 12 hours or more needed to learn to become more competitive, then perhaps this game could be of interest to you.  For me, there are too many better alternatives.  The lengthier 18xx games are, in my opinion, clearly better.

Really brutal but pretty darn good nonetheless.  It's not short, but I find myself utterly absorbed throughout. The depth of this game is incredible. It demands repeat play.

Alas, the player base has been divided up into separate, warring factions. I curse the day Railroad Tycoon was created, and I further curse the day Steam was created. Everyone has their own preferred version, and getting people to agree to play has become more a chore than it is worth. I will continue to play AoS when I can, and savor it, but I doubt I'll ever get to play as much as I'd like.

[Initial Impression: 8]
Age of Steam is a very "thinky" game - it requires long-range planning from almost turn one.  However, those plans must be at least somewhat flexible, as there is a lot of competition for certain routes, and a winner can sometimes emerge by avoiding the most obvious areas for exploitation.  There are a number of interesting mechanics in the game, including income reduction, the auction for player turn that provides for each position, and special powers that can only be chosen by one player per turn.  Some of these feel a bit clunky, but you can see why they exist and it's interesting to see the player strategies that develop in response to some of the mechanisms (e.g., actively trying to not end a round with a score that is in the lower rungs of an income reduction section).  It's a game you won't always be in the mood for (or have time for), but that leaves you with a rewarding sense of accomplishment or of having learned something new, even when you lose.

Fantastic! Have only played twice and it wore out my mind.  Love the tension, the tight economy, the cut-throat nature of it.  Really enjoyable - if you like that kinda thing :) 

Edit: March 2017 - Just amazing. 

Edit: September 2017 - Since getting into 18xx I just have lost the desire to play Age of Steam... is this strange?  Perhaps the similarities make it less interesting?

Rating this a 7 on 1 solo play -- very like Steam's reimplementation, with lots of room for careful bidding and manoeuvering, and very little mercy for those who overstep.

What I like less about this is (a) over-crowded off-board charts, and (b) the randomness of goods growth. I like the simplicity of the 2ed Warfrog art.

But with only one play I expect this all could change, as I grow to know and understand the subtle strategies and differences between the games better.

Definitely a classic!

RATING: 9
This is perhaps the best economic railroad game!  It has a depth in a reasonable sized game and can accomodate 2 - 6 players.  Most notably, it has over 50 expansions that add/modify/ or enhance aspects of the game.  I don't think I could ever tire of the game.

The only down side is political.  It has had a rocky start including feuds between designers and companies.  It also has many "limited edition" expansions or small run expansions.  This makes much of it inaccesible to all but the best funded and connected gamer.  This drawback is really unfortunate for what is in my opinion a top 3 contender for "Best Game Ever".

Tentative score after one play. In our first game, I got the lead in the first round, and my advantage seemed to increase turn after turn. Maybe it was our inexperience, but it seemed that the catch-up mechanism is not strong enough: there were few ways for people to gang up on the leader, and one bad move can kill you.

I have hopes that when every player has some experience, this kinds of things would not happen very often, but I'm not all that sure. My rating can easily move 1 point up or down depending on this.

Finally managed to teach and play THE train game for the first time. 4P took 1/2 hour to teach, despite all being RRT veterans, and 3 hours to finish. 2 players did well (~75 and ~50 VP), I did poorly (20~30 VP), and one did abysmally (~5 VP).

A sadomasochist's wet-dream come true. Do you have a can of kerosene? I would like to torch my copy of AOS right now. This was more painful than having my teeth pulled out, or giving birth (if I was a woman). A bullet to the head please. An accountant would LOVE this game, as this game is as dry as crunching numbers on a spreadsheet. Am I running a railroad empire, or am I constantly bailing out what is an already sinking ship? Where is the joy in that?

Although we were all RRT veterans, I think we've been spoiled by the rather forgiving nature of RRT (except when one is dumb enough to issue 25+ shares of stock--I've done it, it's not fun). RRT is expansive, the board is huge, so you really feel like you're building a railroad empire, sort of like building a N-Scale model railroad diorama. It's creative and intuitive, and it flows. AOS is reality slapping you in the face, and entropy kicking you in the gonads. You start out with $10, but you will lose $3 a turn for overhead (2x shares outstanding, plus a '1' speed locomotive), so if you do nothing, you will be bankrupt by Turn 4. There is a sense of urgency, so you'd better get busy livin' or get busy dyin'. Even if you break out of the lower 10 income spaces, you get hit with income reduction (think taxes and depreciation).

The board is tight, so tight that you'll resort to bizarre track layouts to meet your objectives. You have to foresee the future and accurately anticipate how much money you'll need for bidding and track building, and you'll need to anticipate your overhead costs at the end of the turn. The turn order reads like a turn in Squad Leader. There are 10 phases, and everybody does their thing in player turn order, which is determined through bidding, much like RRT, but unlike RRT, if you stick your nose out and bid, you'll pay at least half if you drop out later in the bidding. The one interesting aspect, however, is the selection of actions, like urbanization, going first in deliveries, going first in track building, or upping your locomotive speed (or "links" as they say in AOS), or seeding the production schedule. These actions are selected, like any worker-placement game, on a first-come, first-served basis. Some allow you to "bud in line" and go first, regardless of your position in the turn order. Some are important early in the game, and some are important late the game. Bidding can be furious, as these spaces are crucial to winning, er, surviving the game.

The flow is different between the two games by nature of their turn phases. RRT is like an open framework or a la carte: it essentially allows you to take any three actions per turn, where you select one of six actions. You then collect your income and pay your expenses (dividends). AOS is sequential, like pre fix, and constrained: Three track hex build; two deliveries. Urbanization and upping the locomotive are divorced from this, as they are selected prior to this. New goods cubes may show up randomly on various cities, afterwards instead of the "city growth" card in RRT, which is an action.

RRT flows better in my mind, since the actions of the various players can intertwine, much like the meshing of both strategic and tactical impulses in TI3. RRT play rotates clockwise, which is straight-forward, but is somewhat not as satisfying. AOS play bounces around, much like TI3 per the strategy cards, or like the play order in Power Grid. But regarding the actions themselves, AOS plays like TI2. Everybody does X in this phase, then everybody does Y in next phase, etc. Tedious. 

I noted that Power Grid is a brain-burner, as is AOS or 18xx. But I don't like AOS. It's too analytical and too brutal. At least 18xx, I feel like I'm running a railroad, through the buying of stocks and manipulating the market. The RRT experience is much more vidid than AOS, like I said before--it's like a diorama. Presently, I hate it as much as I hated PR the first time I played it--it just doesn't make sense to me. It has no joy, or at least, I didn't derive any joy out of my first play. I'm willing to try it several more times, as some of my gaming group (the ones that did well) liked it, but I sense this will go the way of Agricola or worse. Get the kerosene ready. I rate it a "7".

I really don't like this one very much. A poor version of 1830 type games in my view.

At this point I think Railroad Tycoon is the better game between the two because of the beautiful board and components, and the fun factor.

This is a game of moving as many cubes as far as possible.  Building track and getting the roles are means to that end.  The turn order auction is often crucial.

RATING: 7
A tough business game in which you start out, quite realistically from a deficit position. The problem is the actions available in the auction are by no means equally attractive, you win with the 'locomotive' and 'urbanize' choices. OK, you pay top whack for those two, but it puts too much emphasis on the auction and that's never going to be my favourite game mechanism. Bland artwork and pieces and it's a shame that the standard map is one of the weaker ones in the series. Deprecated now by the Steam release, which is much more elegant, but I'm sure some will prefer the original.

I finally got around to playing this, and it turns out I really like it.  The relationship to RRT is very strange, it's like they took the same rules and made a completely different game out of it.  I like the planning, but it's tough. I like the smaller scale quite a bit too--not just the smaller map, but the shorter game play, the game phases that slightly constrict player options, and the lack of crazy unnecessary rules like RRT has.  Interesting. Worthwhile. I can tell I'm not very good, but I'd like very much to play again.

An excessively brutal/unforgiving game that needs to be played and then studied and then played again - or do a lot of research to find out the best openings for any given map.

Unless you're going to play with people of a similar skill level, try Railroad Tycoon instead, which is a much more forgiving game for average players.

I just cant get my head round this game....its not complex or anything. I just feel its one of those games that when you know the game it seems ok but when your learning its counter intuitive. Some of the mechanisms are great (player auction in reverse order) but then how does the soft pass work properly when two players are left?? (pass becomes useless as you dont outbid yourself?) Other mechanisms feel like bolt on fixes to problems rather than elegant game structures. I love wallace games and later games are much more elegant, fair, polished and better.

This game is almost identical to Railroad Tycoon with some minor differences.  AoS takes a much more Euro route with some VERY tight share/income mechanics, added roles, and a smaller tactical board.  It is very easy to slip into an economic death spiral if you aren't careful with your finances.  The roles are a nice variation from RRT and it's also nice to be without all those random, game changing cards to choose from.  In the end RRT gets a bump up for components and another for easier-on-the-user share/income mechanics.  Don't get me wrong though; they are both great games.

Not bad after further play. I do not like how income reduction affects points though, but that is easily solved with a house rule, a points marker and an income marker. I still like RRT better, but this is growing on me. I can't wait to see what Steam holds in store!

If you get a bad start, you will be lost for the whole game. (If you select a place to start build, where it seems good, but then one or more players also build there and more or less block you.) The players may issue new shares of their company, but you may never buy shares of other companies, what I really miss in this game then.

Age of Steam is at heart a game of resource management and tile laying. This solid underlying game is enhanced by mechanics such as the auction for turn order, selection of actions, and goods growth. As with any Martin Wallace design there is some fiddly complexity which adds relatively little to game play (here the pricing system for track-laying is more complicated than it needs to be). The game is punishing to players who fall behind and can sometimes be overlong. But, overall, this is a one of the very best games of its type.

p/u & del:auctions:network connection: role-selection:tile-laying:economic: screwage 

initial rating, don't expect much movement until other train games are played....

Brutal, competitive, unforgiving, punishing, brainburning, enduring, agonizing AND......

GRUELLING, out of all the words this is the best one to describe this game IMO, a real tight economic battle of the minds that will leave you frazzled if you played to the best of your ability, maybe too frazzled and too brainburning reducing the fun somewhat, don't even think of playing this highly strategic game if you haven't eaten your wheaties. You could play haphazardly or half-fast but then you are not playing the game the way it was meant to be played, why bother, just play something less grinding if you aren't up to this challenge and a challenge it is! 

A very good game of balancing long and short term planning versus tactics and very little luck. I'm not sure yet but it looks to me like the leader is too hard to catch which others complain about as well, then the person losing has a long wait until the game ends which is no good and this certainly detracts. Whoever planned the best at the beginning has the best chance to win but its too bad that by midgame if your 'set-up' is not already up to snuff then it will be too late for you unlike some other games where catching up is possible.

I liked the punishing economic track, this and everything else was very balanced but you are forced to take out shares just to keep afloat, what I couldn't figure out was why you couldn't buy them back later? No biggy there though and it sure felt good to finally get into the "black" after a few turns at least. Playing with more than 4 must be ridiculous by midgame on the regular map, I would try 5 players maybe once just to see but 3 was good and 4 would be much better and probably the sweet spot for me. 

For reasons stated above, I'm not sure how often I would want to play or even get to play even though its a very good game that I do want to play again, otherwise rating could of been a little higher. I hope further playings will cause me to up the rating

Let me start by saying that Martin Wallace has established himself as my favorite game designer. And it all started for me with Age of Steam. That's not to say I'm his biggest fan, he's certainly put out a few stinkers (Way out West springs right to mind) but overall I enjoy his games very very much.

That being said...Age of Steam is far and away the best of the bunch!  It's very enjoyable but VERY tense at the same time. You're under an extremely tight budget which makes it tough to get going and to keep your head above water...at least initially, well...not for ALL maps. 

Once you do get going the other players will start crowding your space and "stealing" your goods, making it that much more difficult to stay ahead. You spend a ton of resources and time to prepare for some long deliveries and someone jumps in and ruins your plan! Of course, you can, and will, do the same thing to them.

With the number of expansion maps catching up to (surpassing?) the number Formula De maps, the versatility seems endless! If you include the player designed maps available here on the geek, you could play this every week on a different map and STILL not have playing them all in a whole year! 

It's no longer just a simple board game, this is now a game system. If you like train games and you enjoy deep strategy than this is a great choice. 

I prefer this over Railroad Tycoon without an hesitation. In fact, I avoid playing RT to some extent because I want to play it as I would AoS and that just doesn't work. I know a few people that play RT all the time but only because it's softer and easier than AoS.

I haven't played any of the predecessors to AoS and frankly I plan to keep it that way. This is the pinnacle of gaming. Nuf' said.

Lots going on--in a *good* way. Very clever game. Tense. Bluffing. Screws. Fiddly. Like Power Grid in these ways, but more accessible and allows much more creativity. Takes 1/2 a game to understand what's going on, but then the rules make sense.
 
Nit: I don't like the "public domain" track idea--you built it, you own it.
 
Play with quick thinkers, though.

Update--not really that fiddly. Setup is a bit so--initially placing all the goods is annoying, but after that it's not fiddly at all.

"Let's get the basics down: First, this game doesn't like you. It doesn't like anybody else either, but it particularly doesn't like you. If you ever have a question on the rules or how the rules apply to a particular situation then pick the answer that hurts the most. You'll almost certainly be right."

This game is absolutely brutal in its punishment of mistakes.  Small mistakes early can knock you out or put you in a death spiral of debt from which there is no escape.  I know that sounds horrible, but some of my most memorable games are the ones where I managed to hang on until the end without going bankrupt.  I rode the death spiral and survived -- dead last place, but alive.  The game itself is that much fun for me that even knowing that I've carelessly knocked myself out of contention I still have an incentive to see it to the end.

The mechanism that provides the largest chance for death-spiral-type mistakes is taking shares (i.e. loans).

A share provides you with a one-time payment (varies based on the map) in exchange for interest being due every turn, including the turn that the share was taken out.  Taking out a share also permanently reduces your end-of-game score.

Everyone starts the game with two shares, which means that interest is due at the end of turn one.  The clock has started, and everyone is behind the curve from the beginning.

How many shares to take out is a difficult decision, because you have to do this before you do anything else that turn.  Therefore, you'll have one chance to take out the right amount of debt before you have to perform the following:

* Auction for turn order   roles.
* Build track.
* Collect revenue.
* Pay interest on debt   locomotive upkeep.

The last three can be mostly calculated out ahead of time, although opponents could block your track routes or steal your deliveries.  When you add in the auctions as well, it becomes a lot cloudier.  You have to be able to make educated guesses about what everyone else wants to do, and how much you think they're willing to pay for it.  You need to balance that with your own needs and how much you're willing to pay.

It sounds complex, because it is.  But it's so agonizingly awesome.

I like this game more with each playing; however, a game is easily ruined by one player's inexperince or lack of skill.  So much has to happen right from the start and continue building each turn.  And positioning on the board is a major aspect of the game, creating opportunities for yourself while limiting those of your opponents, watching the distribution of resources carefully so you don't come up short at the end while someone else is allowed to go unchallenged across the board with an abundance of unshared resources.

Rating based on a few games only. The game is fun, exciting, has plenty of player interaction, an elegant design, and it *feels* like you're running railroads. On the bad side, it has quite a bit of downtime while players ponder their moves, and it feels like players can get screwed sometimes, through no fault of their own.

Also, the physical quality of the game leaves a bit to be desired. The game could use a bit of "German" shining up; nicer board, a bit of graphics on the charts, etc., just to give the game that bit more "chrome". Doing the "Attila" thing and using the same colors for players and goods was also a bad choice.

All in all, a nice game. I think I prefer it with fewer (3-4) players, rather than with 5-6.

This game is extremely unforgiving to first time players or early mistakes.  This wouldn't be a big deal if it weren't such a very long game and the people who are in the lead at the start tend to stay there.  The rest of the game is just going through the motions for another 3 hours.  I'm sure it's a thrill for those top 2 out of 5 players... oh wait, I'm not, because they still have to wait for the 3 people who have no shot to keep thinking about their turns.

I may play it again when I wouldn't rather play 2 more fun games in that time.

I think my main mistake was trying to maximize my output of the deliveries and turns that I had in the current round, rather than looking two to four ahead.  But without playing the game before, I didn't really know what to be looking for.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Brutal, in every sense of the word. I love the tight economy, how you have to eke out every ounce of profit, and can't waste anything if you intend on winning.

What I don't like is how random the cubes are.  Relying on a few dice rolls is never something I like - if you roll them a lot, it's not such a big deal, as everything averages out, but when they're only rolled a few times, and it can drastically affect the game?  I'll pass.  Steam handles this aspect of the game better, though not tremendously so.

I also don't particularly like that the game is so single-minded. You build track, and move cubes around, take loans (or, er, issue shares), and, well, do it all over again!  It's nice and simple, easy to pick up, but it almost feels to me like Age of Steam is a part of what should be a more complex, involved, complete game system.  Maybe I need to play an 18xx game.  I'd like to.

Initial Rating: 7.5 (November 2011)

It´s been a while since I played Age of Steam, so I don’t remember much about the game. I recently bought it so I hope to play it again soon and then I will properly re rate and re comment. However I DO remember that I liked the game, it has very low luck and it rewards the player who plans the best. It is also a Wallace game, a designer I respect a lot. All of this is right up to my alley so I think this has a lot of potential to go up in my ratings. 

On the bad side, I remember that I thought the game components were kind of regular. Also, I (more or less) dislike the theme.

For now I really want to play this game, in fact I already have 6 expansions for it :D.

At last I got to play another AoS game. Sadly it was as long as the first one and that detracts from the fun, lots of downtime. Still I recognize this is a very good game. The components are very flimsy and uninspired, but the gameplay is very meaty and heavy. Lots of complex decisions every time, I like it a lot. I will play again soon and comment again. The truth is I enjoyed my Steam play a lot more than my AoS play, but I’m pretty sure I will enjoy my AoS plays with faster gameplay.

I love that AoS is a more harsher and unforgiving game than Steam, also I love that you have to auction the roles. I’m not sure I like the random aspect of the Goods Growing Phase. For now I want to play again soon. I will try to get this to the table soon.

After more plays, Age of Steam is the undisputed train game for me. I prefer it over Steam because it is harder and transmit much more tension. I like that you need to ask for money at the beginning of the turn (not at any moment as in Steam) and the auction is very tense, you begin with so few resources that each dollar count. You have to carefully plan your moves in AoS. Sadly the game has a bad reputation among my friends because: 1. Some of them have lost in the very first turn :devil:, that is, the game can be very unforgiving of mistakes (a plus for me). 2. It is too ugly.

Bottom line, I enjoy Age of Steam a lot, it is Wallace´s masterpiece for me. I will try to play it more in the coming months. I think I currently have over 20 AoS maps I haven’t tried yet.

The map that comes with the base game is not suitable for six player IMO. In our games, the last player in the first round will always be hosed. I need more plays to verify this, but that’s my current feeling. In any case I don’t like to play complex games with more than 4 players so that’s not a problem for me, however, as the game has been hard to get to the table, my desire to play it has decreased a bit over time. I’m downgrading its rating.

Not for the easily frustrated, Age of Steam is not a game intended to be played as a multiplayer solitaire.  I admire this design a great deal but sadly I'm rarely in the mood to play it anymore.  I enjoy focusing on what other players are doing and adjusting my play to accomodate, but I'm less enamored of the direct blocking moves that are necessary to rein in other players.  A great title for those who aren't bothered by confrontation; personally I find I need particular environments to enjoy this title.

What I like less is that everybody builds his own rail network without sharing any other rails. This is not realistic.
The action for new goods have nearly never been chosen. In the game, it's better to build some more rails to cities having enough goods than supplying new goods to cities. For me, it's a sufficient strong action to bid for.

I doubt that I will ever play Age of Steam with 5 or 6 players ever again... you seem to lose control of what you are doing.  One mistake and you are completely shut out from scoring big for the rest of the game... and you just sit there like a schmuck for another two hours, twiddling your thumbs while the other players gain from your misfortune.  And regardless of what others say... it always happens, even with people who have all played the game before.  Fun?... I don't think so.

Even when playing with fewer players, if someone takes an early lead, it's VERY hard to catch him, especially if he's lucky enough to get a few quick random goods placed on his connected cities.   

The penalties in the game far outweigh any benefits.  Starting capital is way too low and upkeep is too high.  You cannot win the game by trying to keep shares to a minimum (a serious design flaw), and the 'income reduction' rule, which penalizes players for doing too well, is just plain silly (the only reason I can see why this rule exists is because of the stated 'runaway leader' problem... it's an attempt to fix).  Too many house rules are required to make this one better.

A lot of people here on BGG applauded 2nd edition Funkenschlag (Power Grid) for trimming down the chrome and extras in a fairly complex game system and distill the original game down to its basics.   However, Age of Steam could be well be considered as a redevelopment of the Early Railways system (e.g-Lancashire Rails, Volldampf, etc.)... which had much cleaner, simpler, and more elegant designs.  There seems to be a double standard here for BGGers who like both games... give me Volldampf over this bloated edition any day of the week.

I'll still play this game with a little coaxing, but if other games are available, I'll probably pass.

I should add that now that I've played Railroad Tycoon, if both RRT and AoS are being offered, it's RRT all the way.

Update:  I played AoS again after a long hiatus.  Even though we played a rule slightly wrong (which didn't affect the outcome), my original evaluation of this game has not changed... it is still much too dry and demanding... not fun at all.

My rating of AoS has dropped with each playing. My initial impression was genrally favorable, but I was concerned that the game had far less player interaction than either of its predecessors and far less elegant mechanics. I had hoped that repeated playings would reveal cooperative strategies, or at least strategies that allowed opponents to have a more direct impact on one another. After 4 plays, it&#039;s still largely multiple-player solitaire as the board layout and tile-placement rules make cooperative track-building unprofitable. The income reduction system is very clunky compared to Martin&#039;s earlier offerings and, disappointingly, it usually dings the trailing players as much as the leader. A real disappointment; not nearly as strong a game as Volldampf or Lancashire Rails.

AoS is not a 'nice' game... though once this is fully understood it slowly transcends itself into a very satisfying experience.

3rd edition, (Rust Belt) US Great Lakes area map (in my neck of the woods, twixt Michigan City and Ft Wayne).  I first owned/played Steam and later picked up AoS, just to find out what all the fuss was about.  I currently tend to favor Steam over AoS as I'm not a big fan of auctions in general and the Goods Growth/Production mechanics seems over the top, both of which are rather time consuming IMO.  I've noticed in subsequent expansion maps that it's the Production system that is changed in an attempt to simplify or improve upon seeding the board with Goods.  My rating will most likely increase as I'm able to get my family members to spend a little more time to appreciate and embrace the dollar auction method of Turn Order which I'm truly intrigued by and feel is especially important in a multi-action network building type game like this.     

I'm not crazy about the general layout and lack in effort with vague examples and illustrations in this '3rd' edition rulebook.  A full area map in the beginning of the rules illustrating setup would have been most helpful allowing for further referencing throughout.  For example: GG/P, page 12, proper illustrations could have easily cleared up any misconception regarding the current convoluted instructions to the light/dark in relation to starting/new cities in the Goods Growth phase of the rulebook.  There is no excuse for a game in it's 3rd edition not to have addressed pre-existing loose ends or FAQs.  No intro and/or ultimate goal?  ...seems rushed.

UPDATE: I'm getting to enjoy the harshness of this game, even more so than Steam.  Something about the challenge... just to stay afloat, win or lose.  I read an interview (by Matt Thrower) with Martin Wallace and he mentions, "I don't like player elimination, I would like to think that some of my games are still enjoyable to play even if you know you cannot win."  I like that.

Tricky mental exercise here. With a limited number of turns you really feel pressured to choose the right role each time. You want to build track and move goods, but pay as little as possible to do so. Issuing shares can give you a cash boost, but at a continuing cost in dividends paid out.

With this game in particular the vagaries of the dice rolls led to a paucity of goods in cities that linked up well with players' networks. The mid-game devolved into a simple bidding war for the Locomotive action, won of course by the player with the most cash on hand at the time. Monopolizing this action let him block out the others who had longer potential links stymied. 

There is probably a great reason for it, but I wasn't digging the point reduction at the end of each turn, since it acted like a catch-up feature in a video game.

RATING: 7
Well after several more plays I've decided to downgrade this game to a 7.

I still think it's a very solid game but it's hard to bring new players into it and a bad start in this game just kills you. There are times where even an experienced player gets into a bad spot early and then he's just playing out the game. And playing a game for a two hour period and knowing you're hopelessly lost is not fun for anyone at the table.

AoS is not complex rules-wise, but it does force difficult decisions in almost every phase of the game. The game challenges you to think in both spacial and economic terms, devising profitable (often circuitous) routes while keeping expenses manageable. As a system, the game is remarkably versatile - as is evidenced by the many expansions, most with their own rules variations. The rating of 10 is for the system, even though the game as published would only have limited replayability with just the base map. If you enjoy this and think you will play it a lot, there are a lot of great expansions out there, both officially and unofficially produced.

Yes, the scoring and the income reduction reek of "gaminess". The production action is too weak with the use of dice to determine which cities produce. I used to rate the game lower for these reasons, but now that I've enjoyed a few expansions, and I've seen how flexible the rules are to allow all sorts of different game play, I can only throw up my hands in admiration and say that this is one of the best games ever conceived.

I do prefer the harsh economics of AoS to the softened up version, Steam. Even still, Steam is quite excellent and if Age of Steam sounds too punishing for your tastes, I highly recommend giving Steam a try.

RATING: 7
Rating for the system (not base map).

AOS is highly confrontational, extremely cut throat and filled with anxiety. In general, a very good time. My only issue is finding a map that scales well from 3-5.

Base Map:
I've now played at all player counts (3-6) on the base map; my preference for this map is 5>4>>>6>>>>>>3. 5 player sessions are the tightest, 4 player sessions maintain tightness but with more more elbow room, 6 player sessions are too long and too crowded and 3 player sessions are too loose and open. I'd be hard pressed to play it with 3 again as the overall experience feels quite watered down.

I know there are different maps for different player counts; however, most maps change fundamental rules which means having to re-learn the rules each time out and that sucks. My group isn't dedicated enough to make owning multiple maps worth it. I still really like AoS but until I get a map that scales well from 3-4 players AoS will spend more time on the shelf than at the table.

WIFE RATING/Comments - 5
It's just too hard and unforgiving.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Played alot after it first came out, but frankly I think its progeny (Railroad Tycoon) is a much better game, with more freedom and choices for the player.  Two rules in AoS I really don't like:  (1) a player is allowed to take something he/she can't use (like a loco bump with a 6 engine) just to deny it to others and (2) you don't have to own the pickup leg to move a cube.  For these reasons, I much prefer RR Tycoon although the new editions (like Steam) which are more of a hybrid between the two may promise an improvement.  Another problem I see is the proliferation of different maps, all of which seem to cost an extra $20 or so, that is my view kind of de-valuing the game like you see with Formula De and other games.

RATING: 7
An easy 8 after one play. Rating could go up. 

A turn of [GameID=4098] is quite simple. You begin by deciding how many shares of stock to issue. You can't go too overboard because you can only issue a maximum of 15 shares over the course of 7 turns. You owe 20% interest on each share during each turn of the game, so you need to balance operating capital against potentially overwhelming debt. The money is only used to bid on drafting order for a set of once-per-turn advantages (like making the first shipment or upgrading your shipping capacity) and laying new track. So you need to be able to afford what you want, when you want it. Beyond that you need to position your track on the board so that you can ship the most lucrative goods before other players, make it difficult for other players to connect to key cities, and make it likely that other players will occasionally use your own shipping lines. That's Age of Steam. Simple, challenging, [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thing/4098-Age%20of%20Steam#linkeditems]expandable[/url], and probably addictive. For what it's worth, I think this game is night-and-day better than [GAMEID=17133]. 

Several aspects of its reputation are overblown. Some find the game too punishing, and harp on the possibility of player elimination. Maybe if you were introducing the game to a casual player and didn't give a simple explanation of the game, you [b]might[/b] see a player eliminate themselves. Otherwise you won't. Moreover, I don't find the game punishing, because for the first two-thirds of the game, your goal is more or less to break even as you lay more track and upgrade your shipping capability. Profitability comes later. 

Update: the coming of Merchant of Venus has really made me question whether this is an 8 for me. I need to give this a couple of more plays to distinguish it from the RTT family. I'd also like to try the new Railways of England map and I suppose Steam as well. But this whole Wallace train game clusterf*** is growing tiresome. Perhaps just not my genre.

RATING: 9
Age of Steam is a game of meticulous planning: You need to size up the entire game at the beginning, assess the board and decide what you will try to do both short-term and long-term. At the beginning of each turn you need to estimate how the entire turn will play out right down to a few dollars, as one share too many is the frying pan and one share too few is the fire. Throughout the game you need to be well aware of the entire board state and tweak your game plan according to opportunities opening and closing.
 
Sounds like a lot to take in? I didn't mention yet that you're not just doing this for yourself. You have to have a good idea of what all your opponents are up to as well.
 
If that's still not enough, each expansion map introduces a few twists to the basic rules. I finished a distant last in my second game of Age of Steam not only because my tactical mind is not well suited to the general task of the game, but also because the little plan I did have ran against the rule tweaks for the map in question.

If I had to pick one single game as my favorite, Age of Steam would be it. 

The combination of having to decide in advance how many shares to issue (to get working capital), followed by a brutal turn order / special power auction is delicious. And while some people seem to think that the board play is near-trivial, I think there are some really interesting and hard decisions on short term vs. long term optimization in track building. 

And that feeling of claustrophobia and desperation when turns come and go, but you're still not profitable and are starting to run out of expansion options. Many of my favourite gaming memories involve games of Age of Steam gone horribly bad, and trying to claw myself into profitability by the end of the game. Not to win, but just to not suffer the humiliation of not even being able to break even.

One thing to beware is that AoS does require careful map selection for the optimum effect. With enough new players, you can play on the rust belt map and have fun. With experts, you really need something a lot tighter to get that "knife fight in a phonebooth" feeling that few other games can provide.

Luckily I have friends who are obsessive enough to own just about all published AoS expansions without actually owning the game. So it's a symbiotic relationship: I provide the base game, they dig up the perfect map for the occasion.

I really enjoy the economic struggle, being on the edge of bankruptcy for the first half of the game, then breaking even, then finally making money!  It's definitely a difficult fight, but well worth it in the end, regardless of who wins.  The plethora of expansions provides enough variety that I can imagine playing this for many years to come.

Update: Age of Steam will continue to be a favorite.  The mix of a brutal economic system, need for FLEXIBLE planning and a very cutthroat auction makes for an experience that not all will enjoy.  But for those that do, there's not much that's better.

A good game, but not as good as I'd hoped. The tile laying is very reminiscent of the 18XX series.

This game is too long and too unforgiving for my taste. I don't find the decisions compelling enough to want to spend time trying to learn the nuances of play. The puzzle element is too high for me. I can see why others like it but I really don't want to play it again.

Very interesting game.  Similar to Princes of Florence in a number of ways -- the limited total number of actions forces you to make the most of your choices and you want to be achieving longer and longer routes as the game proceeds.  Special actions don't seem balanced but each does have its place and there are times when you'll want to bid to secure each of the abilities.  Some athematic funniness that's pretty forgivable.

Spending a whole game digging yourself out of debt reminds me a bit too much of real life, thanks. Sadly, this just isn't my game. It's a bit procedural for my taste, and it tends to be long.

I'll happily play this or any of the AoS-derived systems once or twice a year just to be reminded of why I haven't spent money on any of them. 

Although, if a copy of AoS came up for cheap, I'd probably reconsider...

RATING: 10
Based on 10+ plays (35+ if you include expansions).  Yes, it's brutal to beginners.  Yes, I play with a pen and paper to keep up with the math.  And yes, it's not exactly the Mona Lisa of board game graphic design.  But despite these foibles, AoS is still currently my favorite game.  Unlike a number of overly tactical Euro games, it demands that you plan many turns ahead.  And unlike the excessively strategic Euro games, it inserts enough chaos (via auctions, goods growth, and other players) to force you to adjust those plans every turn.  My only real criticism of the game is that occasionally it forces a player, who may have no real chance of winning the game, into an explicit king-making role.

I also own:

I bought this game after playing it at our local gaming club.  I really enjoyed it.  This is an awesome game.  One definitely needs to plan and think ahead.  There is plenty of player interaction and plenty of strategic depth.  This is a heavy game and can be very unforgiving if one makes a mistake early on.  This game was the basis for Railroad Tycoon which I also like very much.  Railroad Tycoon is just as difficult but a little more forgiving for newbies maybe.

Huge kingmaking potential. More so than any game I have ever played by far.

The game not only allows for situations where one player has the ability to choose the winner (to me, a sign of a poorly developed game), but actually generates these situations intentionally as a "mechanic". The winner of each of the three games I played was essentially chosen by a non-competitive player. I find this to be an unforgivable design flaw.

Excellent game, lots of cut-throat decisions. You need to plan carefully at the start. The whole going bankrupt thing is a little over stated, you would have to make a bad mistake to do this in the first 3 turns. When we play with a newbie we always point out to them how much money they will need to survive and take the shares to ensure it does not happen. We have played twice, with 4 new players and no-one has gone bankrupt.

Excellent strategic economic railway game with track laying and pick-up & deliver mechanisms. Generating a selfsustaining economy is crucial, so don't be afraid to take shares (but don't overdo it: you might go bancrupt or regret it during the victory point count if you end in second place by one point). Get as fast as possible to the point that you earn more money than you spend. Bump up the links for your locomotive as fast as possible, because more links will result in higher income. Keep on building track, as this not only results in points at the end of the game but also provides alternative options during the game. The initial random goods placement ensures variability in game play. Look also for the expansions!

This is were my taste is evolving to.
People that claim that the economy is to tight and than play games were they have to pick one out of a possible fifty actions that score a zillion points...
Well lets just say that I like games were choices matter.

I don't mind snowballing games if the games snowball because of decisions made.

I've only ever played the included map. With 4-5 players it's a wholly engaging experience. With 3 or 6, the game board is respectively sparse or overcrowded. Unfortunately, AoS lends to A.P. quite easily and it can get horribly tedious if players agonize too often. Honestly, it probably takes too long for what it is, but it's still a thoroughly enjoyable experience from start to finish. [b]8[/b]

I've played several times now and it's about peaked for me.  The whole railroad theme is pretty much pasted on.  Sure, I expect an abstract flavor from a simple Euro-game, but I wish this had more meat to it.  I keep looking for a great railroad game and I never find it.  I like AoS, but it's not as great as I had hoped.

I like it and I'm always ready to play it (still don't need to own it). But there are some minor issues: it can takes a bit too long with 5-6 players.

Martin Wallace's masterpiece, I think. It's a very tense game, with all players scraping for every last penny.

After playing without the turn order auction I never want to go back to it.

Very good if you enjoy tension and difficulty. The game rewards long-term planning most, but there still is possibility for a few tricks here and there.

To quote Dorothy Parker's review of the The Last Post; 'It is a novel to be read with a furrow in the brow . . . Yet The Last Post is a novel worth all its difficulties.'  Age of Steam matches this experience.

Beautiful pain.  AoS has beaten me up so bad, I feel on some moves I have been in a collision course with a steam engine, but I will always come back for more. If you come out the other end intact with your wits about you then you have earnt it.  This is a game which gives no one an easy ride.

Avoiding further puns I feel this game is closest to a classic modern novel from a powerhouse like DeLilo or Pynchon.  Maybe difficult to grasp at first but captivating and ultimately rewarding.  A game for those boardgame literate, not a starter game, who wish to challenge themselves as much as their friends.

What a delicious struggle this game is!  You struggle to start turning a profit (and not issue too many shares), to do well enough in the auction to get the action that you *really* want, to get routes before others do, to ship goods before others do, to find the right times to upgrade your locomotive (having to pass up on some other juicy action or income in the process), and to find & create clever routes that will earn you the biggest income.  A Top 10 game for me.

Never having played any "train" games since Rail Baron (as a kid), I was hankering to break in to the genre. I'm glad we selected this one to try first! If you love Euro games and are also a fan of the rail theme you are in for a treat. Network building, pick-up and deliver, bidding, tile placement - this one has it all and uses these features to fabulous effect.  A quality play!

I think this game s very solid (in alignment with its reputation), and I found it to be very finely tuned, the most finely tuned of any Martin Wallace game I've tried.  I enjoy the "random but with some foresight" of the goods cube distribution table, but do find that when combined with the random cube distribution at the start of the game, mixed with the tight geography, the map itself (basic map) can prove to be an unbalanced play area.  I am in love with the auction/turn order mechanisms.

Tight economics. Played on the France board with three players. A couple of good last runs can decide the game. Beyond that, much better now that I've given it another try. I think I still prefer the Early Railways series, but this is a good mass market version.

This game has been replaced by Steam.  If you were considering whether to get this game or Steam, I would get Steam.  The mechanic is pickup and deliver and plays almost the same as Steam, but city growth is too random and Steam does city growth much better.  

Age of Steam requires that bid for turn order and it is difficult to value the bid if you are new player.  It does have dozens of maps.  If you want to invest in many maps, you may want to get Age of Steam.  

I have sseen that players who like Steam tend to find the AoS rules annoying.  AoS players don't like Steam as there are simplifications that AoS players find annoying.

Brutal and unforgiving, which could be a good thing.  I wish the theme were as strong as the game play.  I dislike the mechanic that you earn more income shipping goods via a longer, more circuitous route than the shortest and most direct route.  I'd like it better if it was an abstract.

....because sometimes your hobbies need to be masochistic.

My first play was fairly disastrous, but subsequent plays have been great.  I understand why it's rated highly, and after a few more plays I'll probably give it a similar rating.  It does require a group that's not prone to ADD among its gamers; it's a serious, in-depth game that will brutalize someone who's only giving it half their attention.

CUT THROAT and UNFORGIVING...just like the train business should be. MERCY is for the weak in this one.

GREAT game, with several elements I enjoy.  I don't know how to play this well, but look forward to exploring that and trying different maps.

The bidding mechanic is great, and the tension of grabbing routes, managing debt (a very tight game) is great from beginning to end.

I would not place this above Brass, but it is right there.  It could be as good as Brass as I learn to play this well, esp with the other maps available for fewer players.

This is not a game for babies.

This is my favourite 'pick-up and deliver' game in a time frame of 2-3 hours
+ 
little luck
Enormous variability with dozens of expansions ; with one ruleset you can play more than 30 different games.
Extreme tension begins already in the first round ; I have always that feeling of doom hanging around. Will you have a cube for next delivery or not ?  Is somebody else going to take your goods ? high screwage factor.
In every round you have to take tactical and strategical decisions ; you have to plan many rounds in advance. 
Money management is crucial ; every dollar counts.
- 
1)Not suitable for every group ; very harsh and brutal game ; this game creates sometimes a negative atmosphere in the group when somebody is blocked or when somebody picks up that crucial cube just before you...
2)In many games there is a sort of anticlimax curve; the first 3 rounds of the game are  often crucial and very tense ; you can then already predict who is still in the race ; so in many games there's a runaway leader problem. The last 2 rounds are in many cases a parade round for the future winner. If you are coming from behind, you know you can win... next time !
3)Luck factor plays a certain role at the start of the game ; if others players start in the same or neigbouring city, you can be blocked out for the rest of the game and you can forget your winning ambitions !
4)There is sometimes  a problem of kingmaking because you can lend a route from other players.A not skilled player can give points to one player because of bad play and so give an unintentional  advantage  to some one else. 

Ideal number of players for 'standard' expansions : plays best with 4. 
with 3 : too much open space. 
with 5-6 players : game is too aggressive and chaotic ;only tactical play is possible.  

Some expansions reduce significantly the mentioned disadvantages of the game.

Favourite expansions:
- AoS Mars : 
The track laying system is very complex and excruciating. 
You cannot be blocked in the first round ; the preprogrammed start position is a big bonus for me ; fixes the mentioned problem.
- AoS New Hampshire : 
Very brutal route building system
Kingmaking is impossible in this expansion because you may not borrow a track from another player. In this expansion there's a heavy struggle for acces to key cities.
- AoS New England : 'crossing interstate lines' and 'smuggling action'  is a very clever mechanic ; this system is first used in AoS Moon but I still never played this expansion.

So why do I love this game ? Yes, there's some kingmaking, yes there is sometimes a runaway leader problem, and a(too) high screwage factor... but this is the most exciting game I know, full of tension and "turn angst".  Strategic decisions are in many cases more important than tactical interests.  In fact it's a sort of a "train wargame"

I've said in my review of Wikinger that Eurogames have themes because nobody would want to play an abstract game of that complexity. Age of Steam is, to me, a complex abstract, and unsurprisingly I don't want to play it (again).

I can see that it provides a rather unique challenge and how experience might help to get quicker at the tremendously fiddly endgame, thus improving the density of actual decisions. However, there are just too many excellent and far more accessible games in my cupboard to make me delve deeper into this.

Played once.

Oh, the tension, the drama, the agony!

This game makes you feel like you're losing almost the entire time, and I love it.  Maybe it's the masochist in me, but I find the money tension in this game to be very enjoyable.  It's not for everyone, though.

After many plays I have moved my rating from an 8 to a 9 due to the number of expansions and the variety they bring to Age of Steam.  

Mean, but productive, play in this game is often passive aggressive.  The tactics are subtle.  Overt attacks will often just hurt you more in the end. 

Based on 10+ plays from 2 to 6 players on various maps.

I like this game, however I need to be in the right mood for it. The game can be a little dry and I have never been thrilled with the production. I am not going ot get into the AoS vs RRT thing, but I think they both have their pluses and minuses. There are a few things however thatI am not sure of in this game. 
1) its unforgiving. if you make a mistake on turn one it can be over. You may not go bankrupt but you have little or no chance of winning. 
2) it is possible for someone to king make easily in this game by running block they do not need on someone elses track either to deny someone winning by using a block they need or to prop up aother person's score.
3) some of the roles seem next to worthless for most of the game.
4) some of the scoring seems over complicated for no reason. The income reduction, the track bits at the end. None of it feels like it belongs and people lose games due to not knowing about it or not having mastered how to max points out of it. That feels a bit gamey to me.

Brain-burny, constant involvement, with expansions it scales well from 1 to 6, just the right length, the ability to get better, the chance for doing so poorly you get kicked out, no super-heavy calculations. Freaking genius. Best graph/economic game.

Although I enjoy this, playing AOS is very exhausting. Auctioning for turn order and special action is too tense, money is too tight. Losing on an auction or a cube can be quite frustrating. I think it is the special feature and attraction of AOS. Although I enjoy it too, I don't want to play this too often.

First impression 7

My brain burns after my first game. Is a brutal and punishing game and you have to hold a lot in your brain while playing if you don't want to go broke, or worse, get so far of the leader that you will never even dream of catching him (and in a 3h + game that's awful). But if you are seeking deep strategy in an open information game, this one probably will fit your expectations.

Maybe not the coup of tea for everyone, but definitely a great game. (But if you ask me I'll recommend Steam way better)

After the first play, wonderful game. Very mathematic (with the $$) and complex. It was not soo difficult to understand the rules; I think there are quiet intuitive.
After the second game, (I won), the opinion of everybody about this games is quiet good.

I think this is a very solid game, although it can take a couple of playings to get good.  The game is very unforgiving if you mismanage your money, and mistakes in the beginning can be hard to recover from.  The game does have a runaway leader problem, but I think most of these railroad games where your score is accumulated income have that problem.  There is less cooperation in this game than in Voldompf, but I think that is the point.  I think the game is supposed to be less about cooperation, and more about competition for goods among competing links.

Brutal towards new players. Unusual for a Euro in that players can be eliminated (through bankruptcy) and it can be difficult for new players to value the different actions. Without a grasp of how valuable the actions are, bidding for turn order is tough. That said, it's a fantastic game with nearly infinite replay value especially if you pick a couple of the expansion maps.

This is a brutally wonderful game.  Its heavy and it wants to hurt you. That said, I love every second of it.  

I really like the tension of having to decide how much money to take in loans before bidding for special actions, it really ratchets up the tension as you wildly calculate your potential moves before your turn to bid comes around.  I like how equal the game feels between low- and high-ball loan and bidding strategies.

I like trains, so there’s that. This game is fun – different route choices, creating your rails as you go, tough decisions and ability to block. But it’s also long and the variety of goods setup can be annoying. The board, components, and rulebook are nice. The theme fits in great. It suffers from length and AP though and doesn’t make it out to the table much. 

update: I have found this is certainly almost a niche game in that only certain people like ad will play this because it's heavy mathing on the front end. I'm finding myself liking this version (vs the other train games) more and more.

The rules seem so simple, yet playing it is complex and intense. So little cash, so many decisions. Each turn is agonizing; upgrade, deliver, buy? I think this one is going to take a long time to master. Its a masterpiece, seems perfect in every mechanic and how it all integrates into a whole. The only reason it is not rated higher is that it is a bit heavy and intense to want to play it all the time. And I'm just not really enamored of train-heavy economic games.

Steam seems to be a better implimentation of the game. The 'auction everything, always' mechanics can slow this down, and there aren't many options for wild plays that can change games and strategies markedly. Far less brutally share grinding than coeval train games though.

Where to start?

Ok, this game is really deep.  It's like there are two games - one where you are building rails and shipping goods and so forth and another alternate universe game where you are playing against each of the players psychologically.  It can be pretty cutthroat, but if you fall into the trap of playing against each other, you can be beatenn pretty easy by a bystander who is never far out of the game.  Close scoring!

I don't like train games. Played twice. The first time, 09/09/03, was "eh". The second time, 12/30/03, was the worst gaming experience of my life. It was 3 hours of just getting further behind, with zero chance of getting out of debt. That this can happen is an extremely serious design flaw.

And what really irked me was when the designer was asked how to get out of this situation, all he had to say was don't get in it in the first place. That ranked right up there with the tired old joke, "Doc, my arm hurts when I do this (swings arm)". And the doctor replies, "Well, don't do that."

Game in a Nutshell:  Borrow money, lay track, and deliver goods to earn income and score the most points.

Played as:  3,4 player

Pros:  Has a great blend of planning with some player and game unpredictability thrown in to make it interesting. The game is a stream of constant important tactical decisions where adapting as the game progresses is an absolute must.  I love the constant interaction through the auction and into the building/moving goods phase when name-calling is almost obligatory.  The best part is the satisfaction associated with taking your little train / handful of money, and grinding your way to building a large rails network, with a vastly upgraded train, that’s competing in a spaghetti bowl of other player’s tracks to hopefully turn the greatest delivery points. 

Cons:  Poor presentation values. The ugliest of all "Steam" games with poop-y artwork and the third edition plastic trains only seem to clash with the whole package. The gray-scale mats also look cheap.  Needing a formula to tally the final score is kind of a drag. It’s not as natural of a flow to the game as I would have expected. A well presented but simple player aid would seem like a no brainer however is not included. 

Other:  It appears to me that way too much is made of the threat of going bankrupt early in the game.  Any game explainer worth their salt should be able to easily avoid this with a little warning and minimal hand-holding. I thought the game was a little too wide open with three players and much preferred it with four as bumping heads became almost immediate. What keeps the game from scoring higher marks for me is that gameplay comes across as more of an ever-changing puzzle than a game that allows for creative tactics.

Best Use:  When you need the most solid of train games.

Tough, unforgiving, but delightful game. Asks for an investment but gives an excellent reward. The exact right amount of randomness injected, with different cube spreads at the setup ensuring replayability and avoiding "standard opening moves".
Requires both a long-term plan and short term optimising / adjusting to play properly.
Play basic map with 4 or 5 only. 3 is too little to interact and induces huge cash flows, 6 is too much and players will only bug each other instead of also building something themselves.

Better than Railroad Tycoon, and I beat Lajos, so that was an added bonus.  Not a game that accentuates my best play- the economic ones always get me.  Some tough decisions and chances for screwage, but sometimes did not feel like a 'train' game, with the odd movement of cargo for maximizing points.  In all, a solid game.

9/15: now, years later, I finally understand the game, I think.  Like the agonizing choice of taking loans.  Action selection juicy, all except adding cubes to the board which seeme too chancey to waste an action on.

3/17: Stays tight and challenging.  Early game money woes very stressful.  The shares aspect of the game great...

Good, but I didn't love the mix of role selection in my train game. It felt like a mix of mechanics for the sake of mixing mechanics. I recognize the gamer qualities of the game. Tension. Decisions. They are all there. But I prefer Railroad Tycoon more. It's just a freer, faster, crazier version.

Classic from Martin Wallace
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This has to be the most excrutiatingly tightfisted game I've ever played ... and this is what makes it so great.  Wallace's design is flawless and I'm astonished at how he worked out the math to make it such a perfectly tough money management game.  You basically start off in the red.  You need to issue shares to get money but you have to pay back 20% of each share issued for the rest of the game.  You need money to bid for turn order, etc and to build tracks.  Overall, you need a great strategy and probably need to use your opponent's tracks (which pays them) to deliver goods in order to make the money you need to hopefully get out of the red before the mid-game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Very involved game that handsomely rewards players for planning well thought-out strategy ahead of time.  When I first started playing, it was definitely very heavy for me to get into... however over time the flexing of those mental muscles have been very rewarding.  The sheer amount of added material that comes with all the expansions is mind boggling... this must have quite a following to capture so much additional work!

Sometimes I rate a game higher because of the bits, and sometimes I lower a rating because of some issues in the rules or some mechanics. Even with some tiny imperfections, this is the best of the almost 200 games that I've played since I've discovered the Euros. With the correct group, it really shines.

Update Sep 2008:  

No longer my fave train game and an overrated game at that imo.  Unforgiving of mistakes, prone to AP, but yet plans can be undone by goods movement and the random nature of goods replenishment. 

Also, quite difficult to recover from a weak position or if you're well off, hard for people to attack the leader.  

Wouldn't mind some of the above negatives in a shorter game, but not in a game that runs for over two hours.

---------------------------------
Probably my favourite train game.

However, I've had problems in persuading other gamers to play this game.  It's rather unforgiving of mistakes and relatively abstract.  

It is less demanding than the 18xx series and plays faster, but really, these are two quite different designs.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I am currently obsessed with this game.  I love the tension in auctions and track-building, and I love the difficult decisions one must make in order to stay afloat financially.  In addition, the random cube distribution means every game is different, and players must adjust with different strategies to suit each starting condition.  Against strong players this really is a fantastic game.

I've been meaning to play this one for a while as a Steam fan. Taking loans at the beginning of the turn was not as painful as I suspected, but it does lead to a bit more AP. The way the goods trickle out across the board as opposed to being manually dumped onto spots was definitely an interesting contrast. I even liked the bidding for turn order and roles. This is a strong contender to Steam, and I'll have to try Steam's "standard" game before determining a winner.

I've only played the England map which was definitely too loose even at 5p. I would like to try a tighter map soon.

This is an excellent game. But if you don't like games where economy is a factor, don't bother. I do like economy games and of the train games I have played this is the best so far.

At the moment I'm more steamed about 'Steam' though, but which of them deserves the train game title I don't know yet.

RATING: 7
Not as enthusiastic as I once was about this one, and after a multitude of playings, am coming to the conclusion that the game is flawed. Things I like: Its a brain burner. Tight resources make for an intense gaming session, requiring constant thought and planning. Players teeter on the brink of bankruptcy early on, and its a challenge trying to avoid it. Things I dont like:1. There can be a runaway winner problem in some games; players left alone in their own regions can sometimes become very powerfull. 2. Bad starting board position can ruin you for the whole game. 3. Rules need lots of clarification in some areas, as well as better examples. 4. Bidding doesnt seem so significant anymore as players tend to just drop out and still get what they want. 5. A lot of complex track tiles never seems to get used. 6. Whaddya mean you cant buy and sell shares?

Played once on the Korea map and once on the France map.  This was as enjoyable and meaty as I was hoping it would be.  Players must issue debt to get money to build track to transfer goods between cities (getting income in the process).  My first game was on the Korea map, wherein the goods that cities want is determined solely by what goods are currently in the city, which makes the game even more challenging (and changing) then the original.  This was a long game requiring a combination of tactics and strategy; I definitely want to play more.  The second game was on the France map, but unfortunately one player got ahead on the money early, and thus was able to nearly monopolize building in the spaces that required the engineer.

RATING: 9.5
I often tell people that this is my favorite game. In a lot of ways it is. There are "game-y" elements to it that aren't great and the dice rolling to seed the map isn't my favorite mechanism. Having said that, there are few games that create the tension and real competition of decision making to the extent that AoS does and within a very reasonable time frame. I wish I could play more often, but most economic/train game players prefer 18xx titles and I can't say the same.

This is an excellent game that I just can't bring myself to love.  I just can't seem to "get" the pattern recognition and brain frying choices you have to make as the map gets more and more complex.

Age of Steam has a wonderfully simple ruleset, but it's extremely difficult to play well (I'm only just scratching the surface myself). The game is brutal and doesn't make things easy on the players one bit. It also features a hefty dose of (sometimes nasty) player interaction. This is an absolute classic.

It's been a long time since i've had such a good impression about a game. It is a game of managing a railway company. You build tracks and link cities in order to create a transportation connection between 2 cities and produce income. The mecanics are simple, intuitive and not too brain burner. You play easily in less than 4 hours. I enjoy the theme. Very good simulation. One of my favorites longer games.

I used to love Age of Steam and ranked it a 10.  But it is so hard, so unforgiving, that whenever I consider playing it, I start to get a migraine and just have to move along. I still like it, but don't find myself in the mood to play anymore. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Based on comments here, I thought Age of Steam would be a more "strategic," "tighter," and more "tense" game than Steam. After trying it out, my reactions are "barely," "not really," and "Who cares?"

Yes, the Production display shows where goods will be going, but we're talking about a difference between knowing the location of three (Steam) and five (Age of Steam) goods per city. If this is such a big deal, why not just place five goods in every city to start? The answer is "tension" and "uncertainty," but I call this "luck": some cities will get their goods early, while others will get them late, based on random rolls. Sure you can "calculate probabilities," but that doesn't make me any more interested in guessing whether a coin's going to come up heads or tails. If allowing players to place goods via Production and Urbanization preserves the "tension" and tosses the luck at the expense of a little strategy, so be it.

As for being "tighter," this seems almost entirely based on the share limit. While one player nearly went bankrupt in my one game of Age of Steam, as a whole it didn't feel that much more stringent than Steam (Standard rules). If this is really important to some players, then just apply a limit of fifteen shares in Steam. (Age of Steam die-hards readily dismiss Steam's Basic Game by using similar tweaks.)

Finally, there's more "tension" in the auction, which I suppose I can actually understand. There just aren't as many good actions in Age of Steam, so third and frequently second place in the auction get hosed. Were I more interested in turn order auctions, I might appreciate this, but generally I find them pretty boring, especially relative to the additional time they require. In this case, I actually like Base Steam's action selection and am curious as to how this would work with the Standard Game's financial rules.

Ultimately, as others have pointed out, there's really no need to own both. Personally, I recommend getting Steam and then printing out the Production and Income charts for Age of Steam if you ever want to use the latter's rules.

RATING: 10
Played one game.  I've a big fan of Steam.  And I liked Railroad Tycoon quite a bit.  I think I may like this one the best.  Yes, it is brutal.  I think I may like to have Steam just for a little friendlier game for some.  But when you want the real thing, this is it.  I can see why it gets such high praise.

Update: I've played several games on the Rustbelt map as well as half a dozen other maps and AoS has become maybe my favorite game.  I've bought about 50 more maps and started a monthly game, trying to make my friends into converts as well.  Just love it.  

Some favorite maps so far: Northern California, Scandinavia, Europe.  I have a dozen more I really want to try but I keep getting newbies so I'm hoping soon we'll get a regular group that will be up for the challenges of new maps.

As an aside, I take a little issue with the cost of some of these maps.  I love the Bezier designs by Ted Alspach's because I consider they are reasonably priced.  I hate the unmounted boards of some other designers and I don't care how rare some of these are. Spending $60 or more for thin paper maps is just ridiculous and I don't understand why these people print such limited quantities.  I've bought a few, e.g. Madagascar/Holland, which I look forward to trying but I just can't stomach paying so much for them again.  They just look cheap.

This is one of the best game i ever played, i like the biding and the planing. The theme is just great , who doesn't like train and rail-roads :) with great amount of custom maps specially designed for concrete amount of players. You can find the best map for you and your friends. The game have some very little things i don't like but you can change it to avoid snowball efect, kingmaking and make the game more competetive. Just a superb game i really like it and suggest it to any person who like eurogames , rail-road and biding :)

I really, really wanted to like this game but it fell flat on the first play for me.  I was hoping that it would be a playable 1830, but instead it seems like 1830 minus the part that I like best about 1830 (the stock market).  I understand why people think that this is a great game, but it just didn't have the sizzle for me.  I'd like to try it again before I pass final judgment, though.

I played this only once and here goes my impressions: This is a totally mercyless game, if you don't make enough money in the first rounds you're out of the game. 
Apart from this I think that it's a brilliant railroad management game with many choices. I need to play it more times to see if it is true.
The rulebook is badly written, a friend of ours compiled the english version of the manual with german version to get a more complete understanding of the rules.

RATING: 4
Rating of 4 based on one 5-player session. I don't understand all the hype over this game. It just doesn't feel like a train-game at all. There's WAY too much downtime while players minmax their choices. 6-players is far too many for this game - I think its really a 3-4 player game. The game system has a non-sensical goods delivery system, an over-random economic model and counter-intuitive scoring system. The income reduction rule seems like a kludged check on breakaway leaders, but its ineffective. It reminds me of an awkward implementation of the Power Grid system. The production values seems to be at odds with its high retail price, too, but I guess you're buying all the bits for use in the expansions. Its shorter than most 18XX games, but I'd rather spending 6 hours on 1830, for example, and come last than play AoS and win. I can't see myself leaping at the next opporunity to play AoS. However, I'd be willing to play this game again to change my opinion, but only with a clear explanation/reading of the rules beforehand.

RATING: 6.7
Probably "the" train game. My personal preference though is for a faster and lighter game such as Ticket To Ride. The only real issue with this series of games is that regular players have a significnat advantage over newbies and that it is difficult for players to catch up when people develop a lead.
After a second play in 2014, I think this game is showing its age. Airlines Europe hits the same share based area and is so much smoother.

This is such a well rounded game with loads and loads of re-play value, especially with new maps coming out regularly.

The mechanics are pretty simple but it took me a few plays to work out how everything interacts.  

Game play is very competative with lots of scope for screwage and plenty of high-impact decisions to be made.

Financial mangagement - when to take that extra share and how to make it count - is critical, as is planning for those future shipments and longer links.

Will be a firm favourite for a very long time.

A really tight and unforgiving design that is indicative of Wallace Games and really not my cup of tee.

There is still the lingering issue from Railroad Tycoon where less efficient routes can get you more points which still bugs me to no end, but taking out the arguably broken card system and useless western link are very good things. Giving the players more control in the turn order auctions is also intriguing. Looking forward to playing on more multiplayer maps.

As with many other BGG users, my rating of 9 reflects my feeling of the system as a whole. I would rate the vanilla Rust Belt map a 7 by itself. It's a decent map to learn the basics. Once you've played it a couple times, it's time to move on to some of the other ones.

Having played Steam prior to this, I have a feeling that Steam is a more streamlined system, particularly about manipulating income track instead of issuing bonds so there's only one money system, and the way goods come (not at the mercy of the dice). That said, it's still an extremely solid system and I will be happy playing both Age of Steam and Steam.

Another train game from Martin Wallace that is similar to Volldampf. Issue shares for money, build track and deliver goods. This could be Wallace's best game. It has a very steep learning curve, and best played with experienced players. Difficult decisions on how many shares to issue, how high to bid in the player turn order, and which tracks to build. The tight income throughout the game makes it a very tense game. It's a good game, but it does clock in at least 3 hours.

A very satisfying game of tight fiscal management and occasional blatant shafting of your opponenets. I particularly like it how the first few turns provide a fantastic/horrifying feeling that a single financial misstep could send you spiraling into bankruptcy.

The only drawback is that by the end of the game the board starts to get very hard to look at - it's a mess of tracks and counters; I'm thinking of experimenting with coloured yarn to better show track ownership, but then again, that might just look horrible.

Normally I don't like pick-up-and-deliver game. Just too much puzzle thinking. But AOS is not bad for that genre. I like the auction aspect. I still don't like using other people's track. Not as good as 18xx or Stepheson's Rocket but not bad at all.

Very good game, I'd like to try playing it a few more times to get the hang of things. The guys I played with are pretty nice but I can see how it could become cut-throat.

I don't like how easy it seems for someone in last place to become a kingmaker in this game. I've seen it happen a few times.

In many ways Age of Steam is the kind of game that scratches most of my current itches: no worker placement; a good, sound economic engine that awards planning and punishes sloppy decisions; and I love the theme. The only downside is that it's one of those games that ends just when you've got things rolling. One of the few games where dice actually works for me.

Although I don't have enough experience of other older train games, I can clearly understand why Age of Steam is such an innovation over its ancestors. Every part of the game works really well with each other, and everything makes sense too. The expandability(we have seen several expansion maps so far) is a big plus too. Each expanded version all works well; a slight change of rules often gives the game a totally different feel.

One of the best games from Wallace. The 3rd edition is cheaper (28€) than Steam (33€), so I bougth this one. No bad choise, I think, but I dont know Steam. AoS have very fine mathematicle mechanics. You have mutch to calculate and don't have to lost the general view of the game to win, or like in the first plays, to don't get the chop of the game. I realy like this game, which Wallace brandet as an capture of the 18xx Traingame series.  

Pro:
+ Easy way to play 18xx series
+ Nice working mechnism
+ Working with Groups from 3-6
+ Cool components (3rd edition)
+ The leader could be stoppt

Contra:
- Komplex game, only works with geeks
- Long game time from 2-3.5h
- In a three player Game it could be that 2 persons have a conflict, one is the lucky third person

Time consuming, but well worth it. I like that it is similar to Volldampf in many ways, yet is a totally different game overall, which will appeal to the more hard-core gamer. It's got a lot more "hands-on" systems at work than in Volldampf, and I feel I am always in control of my own destiny with multiple ways of accomplshing my goals available at all times. Once you learn the game, it flows very smoothly, and rewards the experienced player. New players can still have a great time, too, as long as they understand that a game like this needs to be played a couple of times before it starts to sink in, and that just being competitive in your first few games is a victory.

RATING: 8
Just not seeing it.  I get so little out of playing compared to the investment required.  The income reduction is artificial and gamey, and the gameplay is unnecessarily cruel.  I can see why some people might like it, but this falls into the category of 'work' for me, not 'play'.

---Update---
Rating bumped up based on two things:  1) Playing with 6 players is far better than 4 or 5 IMO.  2) After a few plays, seeing the networks emerge ahead of time is easier to do, which decreases the amount of braindrain experienced.  Not a lot, but enough to improve the work:fun ratio.

--update---
Game continues to make mincemeat out of me, but at least I have some desire to improve rather than simply burn it.

--update--
The steady rise in my ratings of AoS is a testament to the veracity of statements regarding the game's learning curve.  Taking the time to get over the hump is definitely rewarded.

I like complicated and analytical games, and this one of that kind. This one didn't click for me. Too long and too much downtime for too less fun. You need time during your turn to play it well, and meaningful thinking isn't possible during the other players turns. What I especially dislike is that it seems to me that those players having a bad start are struggling dummies for the rest of the game, and for that the game is too long.

My only qualm with this game is the same as I have with Railroad Tycoon (amazing isn't it?  Since they're both basically the same game).  There seems to be a major concern about a runaway leader.  I know that the income reduction does something to mitigate this, but I think in order to keep it a nail biter to the end, you might need another mechanism to keep it close.  I really enjoy the planning aspect of the game, as well as the difficult decisions on how to spend your money and what special actions to take.  A lot of fun!

Played this and Steam. They're both excellent. Mildly prefer Steam, as it seems less random (in AoS, you roll for what goods get produced).

This is a very good game, but not great, despite its super high regard on this board. I find it somewhat fiddly and the luck factor is too high for such a long strategy game. It gets too slow with more than 3 players and the luck and randomness go up too. Furthermore, to mitigate the runaway leader problem, which the game is highly susceptible to, an 'income reduction' mechanism has been devised. I find this tool inelegant and even crude. I wish this was handled differently. Still, the game is very engaging, has high replayability value, and creates a tense and competitive mood.

Wow. Finally played this for the first time and something about it has got me thinking about the game long after it ended. I disliked the player elimination that is possible, and it seemed to suffer from a slight runaway leader problem. Downtime was also more than I would like, but it was a 6-player game. My feeling is that this game would shine with experienced players. Strong desire to play again.

The father of Steam and Railways of the world. It's similar to the advanced mode that comes with Steam, and in fact the tiles and trains are usable with Steam. Many of the maps overlap as well. The big difference between this and advanced steam is that die rolls determine which cities restock. The rules are written are a little ambiguous. It's also hard at a glance to tell how many players maps are appropriate for.

RATING: 8.5
Very tight design with the overall gameplay taking players through multiple phases. Initially ultra-tight finances and very short contracts. Then, as the short contracts are used up the money crunch eases. Finally, only the long contracts can sustain the players position in the income track, money is much more available, and this causes both extreme track building and extreme bidding for roles. Game length with three or four players is very good (haven't played with more yet).

Good Game. Different flavor than Rail Road Tycoon. More complex, lots of variables, very low margin for error. Requires very tight resource management abilities, much more analysis and planning.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Ouch. Just, ouch. This game simply despises you, despises your family, your hopes, your dreams, your cat, all of it. As a game system it is really, really mean. Everyone bids for different abilities with money they can't afford to lose, then they all build unaffordable personal track on a shared board to try and move precious cubes between cities for desperately needed income. Money is tight, your plans can be utterly ruined by another player's bid being a dollar higher than you were anticipating, and someone can easily steal a delivery you badly needed to avoid spiraling into debt. It punishes mistakes, gives you choices between horrible things (so you choose the least bad), and it requires money to move forward yet is incredibly stingy with it. 

One of my favorite things about this game is how money is scarce until the very end, when the surviving players finally become profitable…just in time for cash to immediately become valueless (the rules state "money is just a tool"). Sometimes I lose this game and lose badly, finishing in 5th place out of 5 players, but there is still a sense of accomplishment at having made it to the finish line. 

By last count I own 25 Expansion maps, which is patently absurd given how infrequently I've played this and given how grim my prospects are for getting others interested in playing this. But that merely demonstrates how compelling I find this, that I am willing to give it a leash of almost unmeasurable length purely on the  off chance that some day someone else falls for this exercise in self-flagellation the same way I have. I will keep waiting, for some day my prince will come.

I have played this only once and with the Ireland expansion, so my insight into Age of Steam is rather limited. I do like the game however. It is a solid game. I must say I would have preferred more theme and artwork, I am not a Eurogamer after all. Furthermore, the leading player has an advantate due to the accumulative success. Once in the lead stays in the lead. We played a three player game and one player was doomed from the 4th turn whence he could not recover, as he was tied up in cost and could not build etc. There should have been some sort of houserule which helps the last player back to his feet (the last player cannot "lose" income" or so). A nice game which is a tad to dry for my taste, but I am happy to play it again.

RATING: 6
I'm somewhat ambivalent about Age of Steam.  Some games it seems like the best game ever with players vying for resources, racing to build track and competitive bidding for turn order.  Other times it feels like a tedious math exercise.

Players bid for turn order at the beginning of each turn, then they select special actions, build track and ship cubes.  The farther you ship cubes the more you income increases.  Finances, especially in the beginning, can be very tight.  It's even possible to go bankrupt and get eliminated from the game.  I find this to be an excellent and invigorating part of the game.

The end game feels less tense to me.  Likely because I haven't figured out what I'm doing yet.  But also because there comes a time in the game where you can lay the spectre of bankruptcy to rest.

I used to have the Warfrog version, but traded it.  Recently picked up the Eagle Games version.  I thought the plastic bits would annoy me, but the production values are amazing and I'm forced to admit I like it better.  Though I think the box isn't as thick which means less room for expansions.

March 2011: Downgrade from 6 to 4. Simply not fun. 

Winning strategy: Deliver the most 6-link goods!

----------------

My dad prefers playing with half the board rather than playing with two colors. (The game is less fiddly and plays much faster.) I think my dad likes this game the same reason he likes Puerto Rico: intuitive rules, turns go by quickly, good theme and game mechanics integration.

I'm worried about replayability, though: Because we play this two player (no other willing opponents in the house), and the locations of the cities are fixed, the tile-laying aspect might get repetitive. A more significant problem (but this might be because I’ve only played this two player) is that some of the actions are totally useless, making many of the auctions for turn order bland affairs.

UPDATE: Downgraded from an 8 to a 6. This is *too much* of a gamer's game! You need highly competitive auctions right at the beginning of the game in order for the tension to last throughout the game. If that doesn't happen, then the most experienced player would get an insurmountable lead. That's probably the reason why I think this game feels a bit too long, and why some of the auctions feel useless near the end of the game, that insurmountable lead problem.

I actually prefer this game the most as two-player, with the half-board variant.

Just play 1830 instead!

The upside:
-It's the closest you'll ever get to a Cinderella's mother-in-law kind of experience. It's mean, demanding, unforgiving, makes you cry, and doesn't care to recognize how pretty you are on the inside. 
-How is the last point a plus? Well, when It ends, no matter what, you feel rewarded, you survived (hopefuly), and that must be like getting a prince...like Cinderella.
-There's a lot of expansions which, apparently, surpass the base game by far, either in quantity and quality of decisions. And adapt to every player count.

The downside:
-Wouldn't this be improved, at least 1%, by taking the production to more deterministic levels?

Difficult game to rate. As with Puerto Rico, I'd almost refuse to play this with slow players and/or newbies. Just too frustrating, as the tactical nature of the game means you have to tap your fingers waiting for each move. Don't mind doing this, but my first game took 3.5 hours. I really enjoyed my last game that was played in two hours, as the downtime was (just) kept to a tolerable level. Typical Wallace game: lots of decisions, multiple game mechanics and the ability for some un-typical euro meaness. Like to play the Irish expansion, as a 3 player game would rocket along. 

Main problem though is the bidding. I much prefer playing RotW without it, so this game is essentially a dead game I suppose!

To be honest I`ve never been particularly into railway games, but this one is a true gamer`s gem. AoS is tense, gripping and hard. It constantly pushes you to think thoroughly about your and opponents` next moves. If you want to win that is.. Not just tactics but subtle strategy with a strong theme on it too. This game is not for casual players though and playing time is two hours minimum, 3 hours on average with more players. Learning curve is at first steep, but the game mechanics in itself are quite simple once you get the hang of them. Production qualities of the components are ok but could be better: coins and wooden tokens are very nice and track tiles are sturdy and functional, map is thick but not even close to being beautiful, income track and goods chart are just thick paper with black print on them. So don`t expect a pretty game with fancy graphics & chrome but instead a more spartan look. Anyways gamewise this is getting better play by play and that`s what matters in the end. IMHO even better than Puerto Rico. Highly recommended.

Great Martin Wallace train game. Economically very unforgiving and enthusistic beginners often find themselves bankrupt. However the wealth of boards is an abundance of riches testifying to the success of the design.

RATING: 6
I really enjoy the way the different mechanisms come together in this game, especially the issue shares, pay for shares balance.  Also the satisfaction of building a rail network can't be overlooked!  It's a tough game and can be an unforgiving one as well.  I'll play it from time to time, but I'm not quite as dedicated to the game as a large following of the community.

The game probably deserves a score slightly higher than a six, but I honestly have to be in a "mood" to play AoS.

I have now played a second time. The first game was bad due to bad application of the rules, learning of the intricate strategies and the difficult map. Second game was better. It definitely is a gamers' game, one where you can involuntarily be thrown out of the game, by making unluck or bad decisions. Players are struggling to stay alive for half the game, and can (finally) work on a strategy that may give you the victory only halfway through the game. Better players may work on a strategy early on.I suppose that as far as that type of game goes, it is a good game. However, in terms of complete playing experience, I could not avoid feeling down after an hour of struggling to make it to the end of the turn.I would increase my rating from 4 to 6.6. I would not mind trying this again.

Played only a few times but it is very good. I read about it (here on bgg) and got high expectations and was not disappointed. I am a 18xx fan. AoS is a perfect game to introduce experienced gamers (playing Puerto Rico etc) to this type of game. But it also stands out on it's own. It is slightly lighter than 18xx and should be playable in 3 to 4 hours. Just can't wait to play it again!

This seems like a real brain burner at least for first time players.  I'm not sure I really get the gist of this game.  Got beaten really bad.  Seems like a good game but has a bit of an abstract feel to it which for me reduces the fun factor.  Not a bad game just not as great as I was hoping.

April '09: Really enjoying Age of Steam (mostly Rust Belt map).  Played first game a month or so ago in anticipation of Steam's release.  Tim borrowed Tom's copy and we've probably played 8 games so far.  Love most of it.  Wish you didn't need such a non-efficient track system to gain the most points, but it's still a great, great game.

As an aside, I've been pretty disappointed about the way some hardcore AoS fans keep jumping on the Steam threads with more and more negative comments.  But that's life, I guess.

Once Steam comes out, I see myself enjoying it even more than AoS.

I have only played this once, at the local games club in November 2014. It's definitely not my sort of game - I'm not into train games or economic games in general, and am also not a fan of Wallace. It didn't actually seem that bad, although incredibly brutal (the other 5 players were all very close with 30-odd, I ended up on minus 20-something, and what is worse is that it is not clear to me what I did so wrong, I just knew by halfway through that there was nothing I could do to avoid losing money and points) - I'd certainly not refuse to play again, although I'd also never choose to do so. There are certainly tough decisions throughout, and I can just about see why this game is highly regarded - but it's not really for me.

One of my earliest exposures to games in which you have to fight the game almost as much as you have to fit the other players. A big part of the winning comes in your early analysis of the board state, but you have to think on the fly and adapt to what the other players are doing or you are doomed. So many expansion maps have been made, I want to try more!

RATING: 9.5
My favorite game. Simple rules, but highly strategic and tactical, brutal. The game is won and lost in the auction.

Clearclaw describes it best:
"Let's get the basics down: First, this game doesn't like you. It doesn't like anybody else either, but it particularly doesn't like you. If you ever have a question on the rules or how the rules apply to a particular situation then pick the answer that hurts the most. You'll almost certainly be right."

RATING: 9
Brutal.

A struggle to remain solvent. Players begin saddled with debt. As players take loans to pay for track builds and to bid for turn order, that debt inevitably increases.

Worse, a player can become stuck in a vicious cycle. He or she might take more debt to pay for the debt they've already accrued.

A satisfying pick up and deliver financial game that creates brutal player interaction and rewards good planning. The train theme is well integrated and fun to play. The auction mechanic creates fantastic agony in deciding whether to stay in or drop out.

Dislikes
I really dislike the way cubes enter play. The randomness in this one area is so glaring in light of the pure choice driven gameplay of the rest of the design. The special action of placing random cubes on the city growth chart so that they might come out is such a ridiculously underpowered choice compared to the other actions that it bothers me to no end that it is there.

Based on one play.  Feels like a man vs. nature novel, maybe something like Robinson Crusoe, if Friday were a friendly but competitve companion.  You get a sense of accomplishment just by surviving.  Pleasant, brisk, despite the somewhat long playing time, reasonably intuitive rules.  Meaningful interaction, fun infliction/sharing of agony in trying to survive.  I made big mistakes my 1st game and can't wait for the opportunity to correct them!  It's not the hard, brutal game I was expecting based on the reviews--it was very pleasant to raft along wild economic waters, navigating your way to solvency, all the while watching others struggle and flounder a bit.My rating of 'Power Grid' may have to go down after playing this--Age of Steam offers many of the same emotions and challenges, but at a stronger level, and with more player control.

Difficult pick up and deliver game that has you on the verge of bankruptcy through the first part of the game and it really feels like an accomplishment when you finally break through and make a profit. I've been playing some of the expansion maps on this lately, and find myself missing some of the refinements introduced by the newer Steam. I don't like the way goods come on to the board in this game, and, while I appreciate the tension involved in issuing stock and deciding how much money you need for the turn, I think that this game is much more prone to AP and longer play times because of it. I do enjoy the auctions, but, again, the enjoyment of them comes at the cost of a longer play time. Longer, more brutal, less refined, more brain-burning and with more downtime, I give the edge to Steam as far as implementations of the system. I DO like this game though, I would just prefer to play Steam if given a choice.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
First playing very good.  I can see why others enjoy this game so much.  The rules are quite simple, but lots of thought on how best to proceed in a turn as money is so very tight.  It might appear that some choices are obvious, but considering what your opponent's might do makes it less so.  It is an intense game as a result.  By intense, I mean I finished game as if my brain had just run a long race.  

Because of the intensity, this is a game I will need to be in the mood for to play.  My rating is starting a bit low as I think I need to learn a few more strategies in the game before I notch it up to an 8 or higher rating.  Right now - usually willing to play but might turn down a game if suggested if not in the mood - and that makes it a 7 in my book.  I find that I am thinking about what I might want to do differently in the games played, which is usually a good sign that the game has some traction of appeal for me.

This is a very enjoyable railroading game.  It plays in about 2 hours and features gut wrenching decisions most of the way.

Brilliant!

RATING: 4
Simply not as good as the original (Lancashire/New England Railways).  The combination of an income reduction (tax the leader) system that no longer works as originally intended and a complete lack of route sharing makes this game, well, not fun.  Perhaps if players could own individual track tiles instead of entire links?  Also, some of the actions you bid on are simply dogs.  Restocking of commodities sucks, requiring amazing planetary alignment to benefit the poor sap who took the action.  Won't ever ask to play this again.  Lancashire Railways, anyone?

(Update) Rating bumped up slightly after another play.  The "rein in the leader" mechanism flat doesn't work (perhaps twice in our three player game did it actually benefit the trailing player at all), and the fact that money doesn't count leads to degenerate turn order auctioning at the end.  This game could be seen from orbit to be a Martin Wallace game: you want to love it, you can tell it's almost fantastically good, but you realize it's just another flawed game.

Interesting system. I'm still getting used to it, and keep playing with the different rules of the different boards that Maks (who owns it) keeps bringing, so I've still never played the "standard" version.

2009-07-03: I've now played the standard map a few times, and continuing to enjoy AoS. I got obsessed enough to make the wiki page [[Age of Steam FAQ]] and to download some more maps to try out. The game does not feel elegant to me, and it's not ideal as a 2-player game, and it's a tough one to teach to newbies (because of its brutal "the game hates you" nature, and because it's a bit long for more casual gamers) - nonetheless it's an excellent game that I'm glad I am finally into, and I expect to keep playing. I'm also happy that my SO also enjoys it, despite it being longer than her normal preference.

2010: I've played on a variety of maps now and still like it. I wish the production weren't random though; that's my main gripe with the game.

Classic route-building game competing for delivering goods.  I know there are tons of different maps and tweaks to the rules, but I feel it is a bit dated and the way income and turn bidding works it's possible for one or two players to snowball and know who's going to win a couple rounds before the end.  I'm interested in eventually trying some of the other versions like Steam but I think I will likely always prefer Power Grid/Wealth of Nations and full-on pick up and deliver games like Crayon Rails.

I just... I just don't know.  I need to play against better competition to get a feel for the brutality of the game.  My wife isn't competitive enough in the bidding, and it's not too tight with 2 players.  I feel like I'm missing out on the experience until I play it with 4-5 experienced gamers.  I want to like the game, and it seems to have all of the pieces in place for me to enjoy it, but right now, I just can't enjoy it.

And that reads "much better than I originally thought", too; the potentials of bankruptcy are not quite as omnipresent as I had originally presumed.

I've never had so much fun being nervous.  I think this is the consumate 'plan ahead' game.  If your unable to plan out at least a turn ahead AND have back up plans...  then you may not do well.

Age of Steam myths:

It is complicated:  sure, it has some rules depth, but i wouldnt definately not call this a complex game.  No moreso than many medium-heavy euros.

It is brutal.  This isnt so much of a myth, but it is overstated sometimes.  Unforgiving would be a more accurate word.  Theoretically player elimination can happen, though anyone who understands the rules(green or experienced) can easily avoid it.  

Long term planning is why i love this game.  It seems that so many games are more tactical in depth anymore and dont reward a sound long term strategy. 

This is a great game for people who like to burn their brains on upcoming turns.

This is a very good game, and I can see why people like it. You need to manage your resources carefully by working out what others are up to, predicting what you can do in the coming turn and making sure you have the money to achieve that. There also seems to be room for some creative play in spotting the best combination. 

For me, there's a little too much heavy thought, staring at the board, doing sums in your head and so on. I'll play again gladly to see if I can do better the next time, but it's not something I would request.

Unthematic (in that you try to avoid delivering to an adjacent city over your own track, lay track to nowhere, etc), but enjoyable. Nice wooden bits too. I quite like the share angst, and am looking forward to trying out some expansion maps. 

It's a bit light and tactical for my tastes, though, due to the weird auction and the aforementioned track-to-nowhere laying. Railroad Tycoon is the better game, IMO, but I suspect an 18xx will be the only rail game meaty enough to get a 9 or 10 out of me.

So, a good game, but basically overrated.

Update: ...and indeed that was the case.  One game of 1830 is a better time investment than three games of AoS.

This game does a great job of requiring long term planning. One must be concerned both with where there cubes for next turn will come from, but also where cubes for the end of the game will come from. 

The loan mechanism is great. A player can get the money he needs for a given high cost turn. But, the opportunity cost is high. This comes out especially well in the auctions, where there are real benefits to be gained.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Disappointed with this game, there is far too much luck in it to make it worth playing. All the planning players seem to be doing is undone by the random drawing of cubes (alright if they suit your network, tough if they don't) and the random distribution of goods (nothing for one player while another is handed a game winning booty).

Unlikely to play again, two hours for the outcome to be decided by the final two dice rolls? No thanks.

WAY too punitive to be fun.  Why bother playing if you MUST do certain things the same way at the beginning every time?  Just get to the "fun"!  Which, by the way, isn't fun.

This game single-handedly turned me off the whole of train-themed games.

Picked this up after trying RRT and really liking it. AoS isn't better or worse, its just different. Despite many similarities, AoS is much tighter economically, and there is more competition for available resources. RRT has the easier economic model, and feels more open (due to larger board) but you really get the feeling of building your own little empire.  I can see playing either one happily depending on my mood.

Record: 3-3

I hate income reduction. It's ridiculous that your late game big plays that you built up to are worth less because you bumped into the next income reduction bracket. It's ridiculous that you sometimes want to do otherwise sub-optimal things based solely on your position on the income track. And it's also ridiculous that your opponent might deprive himself of 2 points just to push you into the next Income Reduction bracket.

The game uses this income reduction to force players to upgrade their locomotives and keep doing bigger deliveries (because each turn your deliveries are worth less once you hit income reduction)... so you are not only playing against your opponents, but also the game. I don't see how that's necessary, you win if you outscore your opponents - why does the game need to step in and kick everyone back at these discrete intervals?

Railroad Tycoon's version of income reduction is brilliant - as your score goes up, your income peaks and then comes down. In AoS, you [i]VPs[/i] get reduced, not just your income. Income and VPs should be split, as they are in Railroad Tycoon, or in Brass.

Having to take shares of stock up front is also a point of contention for me. All it really does is make the game take longer, as you have to meticulously plan out your turn, and probably a backup plan, because taking 1 share too many is brutal, and being short $1 can be an [i]even bigger[/i] kick in the nuts.

I guess I will preface this by stating that I really like games with a train theme -- everything from Transamerica to Ticket to Ride to Empire Builder and 1825.  I had pretty high hopes for this game.  Unfortunately, I was very much disappointed.  I'm not really sure what to say other than that the game was simply not fun.  Yep, we were playing by all the right rules, just no fun.  So, I would certainly be willing to play again (and have) with someone who really wanted to play, I would much rather pull out either Volldampf or Railroad Tycoon or any number of the other train games available.  [07/13/2007] [5]
------------------------------------------
It seems my opinion of Age of Steam has undergone something of a transformation over the years.  While it is not my favorite train game by any stretch, it is one that I do enjoy playing from time to time.

I will say that I absolutely will not play on the original map with six players again.  I suspect that I will avoid five as well.  However, three and four seem to work out just fine.  I am even now interested in trying out some of the available expansion maps.  That is a far cry from where I used to be.  [05/18/2009]

Good but not great game.  Almost total lack of ability to affect the leader and many of the abilities you bid for are very weak in comparison to the best ones.  The game really seems to have only one valid strategy (issue stocks and build lots of track).  Virtually no cooperation between players.  Even with all these failures it is still a good game, especially if you play with a few house rules which make some of the abilities better such as engineering giving one addition *free* track instead of just 1 free track, the first turn ability allowing you to always go first the next round not just allow you to pass once, and production allows you to force a reroll of the goods dice once.

Now own 3rd edition after selling 2nd ed.

2nd Edition. Apparently still on a sllloooowww boat to the US. Seems like Warfrog doesn't think much of the US market...

The game is very intense. Players need to be aware of every element on the board (city placement, goods placement, etc) and have alternative plans.

Yes, money is TIGHT but sell shares (not too much though) to balance it out. No point going bankrupt just because you don't want to pay the extra few dollars for shares.

This game has an auction, building, 'role selection', money and resource management. Wow. What more can you ask for? Bloody cerebral game. Eager to play  more. Have the second expansion and it looks tougher!

This has the potential to become my favorite railroad games. Our first game was particularly brutal, but I am ready to give the game a second go and fix the mistakes I made the first time around. 

2/27/11: After 6 plays of the game, 3 on the Rust Belt, I am ready to say that this is a definite 9. It is fast becoming my favorite railroad game and has become my newest obsession. It is certainly in my top 5 games. This one has the potential to go the long haul and grab a coveted 10 rating. More time will tell.

RATING: 7
I enjoy the "richness" of this game, that is, how the game's mechanisms interact with the theme to create the feeling of actually building railroads and transporting goods. I am also a fan of the spartan graphic design. But Age of Steam possesses a real downside for me. First, the game isn't very forgiving. You need to make truly optimal decisions each turn in order to triumph over your opponents. Second, the game only really shines with a table-full of experienced Age of Steam players who also enjoy the game. This rarely happens for me. Age of Steam is a very good train game, but it isn't my holy grail of such games. I suppose I'm still waiting for that.

Örülök, hogy adtam még egy esélyt a vonatos játékok királyának. Igaz nem a Steamet próbáltam ki újra, hanem a nagy elődöt, az Age of Steamet, amit még nehezebbnek írnak, mint az új változatot. Ennek ellenére most esett le a játék minden apró és kevésbé apró mechanizmusa. A tavalyi rossz élményeket most a szinte tökéletes játékélmény váltotta fel, szinte minden megvilágosodott a játék alatt, pedig már semmire nem emlékeztem szinte a Steam szabályokból. Így kezdem látni a játék mélységeit és azt miért dicsérik annyira ezt a játékot. Ehhez biztos hozzátett az, hogy azóta sok komoly gémer játék megismerésén vagyok túl. Az előd egyik régi változatával játszottam, aminek kivitele nem éppen mondható szépnek, de valahogy ez is eltörpült most a játékélmény mellett. Különbség az új változathoz képest, hogy itt az árukockák kockadobással kerülnek föl, de egy nagyon jó kis mechanizmussal a városokra, a pénzszerzés is más kicsit. Valahogy nekem itt minden jobban bejött, mint a Steam esetében, bár lehet ha most játszanék azzal újra már sokkal jobban tetszene az is. Összességében aki egy komoly vonatos játékra vágyik, annak bátran ajánlható az Age of Steam, jó kis komoly gémer játék, de azért a nehézségétől nagyon megijedni nem kell.

[2012-07-29]
3-an is működik a játék. Kicsit az árukockák felkerülésének szerencséjét lehet hibáztatni, amit a Steamban kicsit orvosoltak is, de ha jól belegondolunk előre lehet látni milyen városra milyen kocka kerül így minden számolható. Nagyon jó játék az Age of Steam. Emelek is a ponton.

RATING: 10
Certainly, one of the most brilliant games I've played.  Perfect for what it does.  This game is like treading water hoping to keep afloat before the rescue squad comes.  The joy in the agony of making crucial decisions is only surpassed by watching your fellow players squirm.  Easily one of the most brutal games created.  For how complex the decisions are, it is amazing how simple the gameplay is.  Perhaps a little long and exhausting for regular play, but this game has now become an event.  I foresee this taking up a long evening once every six months (which in my book doesn't get much better).

UPDATE: I find myself wanting to play this all the time, and have found that I can now get some regular play out of the system.  The more I get games on the table the more I want to play this.  With all the maps out there I just can't get enough...  

UPDATE:  I've come to learn that this is my favorite game.

I rate all the maps on their own scale compared to each other, so a map rated 7 is still a ten in my book as it is more AoS and therefore better than anything else in my book.

[b]PNP:[/b]
JAPAN (7): Like all other games set in Japan, the maps restrict movement and the long banana makes for difficulties when everyone wants to get through.  Normally this is fine, but there are essentially three distinct parts of the map with the center able to handle two players and the two outer regions able to handle one each.  The problem with a four player game is that if one area can't allow for a good starting position with an uneven spread, you end up with two players cutting each other's guts out while the other two build a wonderful network.  Sharing is usually a good thing in AoS, but when the Locomotive action isn't permanent to lose a ship to the upgrade makes for less inclination to share.  Players stuck in the back have a much harder time advancing as they need both ships to stay afloat, whereas lead players can very easily afford to upgrade their locomotive.  I'd play it again, but only with three.

Very hard game, 1 mistake in the beginning and you're screwed. I like this game but I can't help to notice some very big design flaws...

Great mix of tile laying and money management, with a pick-up and delivery mechanic.  Knowing when to take a particular role, as in PR, is as important as figuring out where and when to expand your empire. Very accessible despite its depth, and plays in 2h.  Plays well at different skill levels.  Age of Steam is very strategic, but you always need one or two backup plans.  Downtime can be a factor as you have to determine your financial needs prior to each round, often down to the dollar.

The game is too tight and the options too limited to be all that enjoyable for me.  While I can see its strategic depth, it's just not for me.  I'd rather play something that is a little more forgiving and has a bit more freedom - it was too difficult and limited for me to achieve my goals and the game rapidly devolves into having only one or two options.

It's still one that I need to play again to get a full opinion, however.

I really don't like the planning that you have to do in taking out shares, as a mistake there can pretty much ruin your game.  I like the variant that allows you to take shares at any time, but only giving your $3 per share.  That fixes the brutal nature of the game.

A GREAT game - one of my favorites! Newbie games can be 4-5 hours, but much faster after some experience.  Has much of the tension of 18xx games (from my one play of 1846) but more streamlined, less fiddly. You are constantly involved - in auctions, in looking to see if someone is going to steal the cube you MUST have. Lots to think about, plenty of tension ... and I have only tried one board of ONE expansion so far!

12/7/06: finally bumped it up to a 10! With so many different expansions, I doubt I'll get tired of this any time soon!

  You really have to manage your money carefully, especially in the first few rounds.  Since money is so scarce, your expenditures must pay off-wasting money here is costly!  I loved the game except towards the end, when the calculations for which goods to deliver are a bit cumbersome with so many lines covering the board.  Looking forward to playing again and I can see my rating possible increasing to a solid nine.  Update:  upon further playings, my rating dropped to 6.5 then shot back up to an 8, and has now settled at a six.  My main quibble is the endgame, which can become an exercise in calculations.

This game is too cut throat and unforgiving for my preference. While this game has only a few minor differences from Steam, I would much prefer to play Steam. instead. In Steam, you bid for your role whereas in Age of Steam you bid for order. By bidding directly for your role, it helps to alleviate some of the tension because you know exactly what you are bidding on. I also prefer the loan system in Steam as you can repay your loans whereas in Age of Steam you cannot.

Excelent game. Full of difficult choices, very hard to manage. Martin Wallace at his best. Maybe his most balanced game.
The thing is that I can't win this game. I love playing it but I suck at it!

Rated it a bit lower because that's a game that I don't ant to play very often. It's one of those cases where the game is better than its rate.

I don't play this game more often for two main reasons: first of all because it's too much dense and difficult to play feeling a bit like real life.
Secondly because after Steam was released we all think of it as a more simple and playable game. It's not a better game it's simply a more easy and friendly experience.

UPDATE:
Still find this a very good game although I can point it some defaults now that I probably didn't see at first. The main issue with the game being the fact that an early winner can be found which makes the game really uninteresting at some point. Why should I bother playing a game if I know who's going to win it? 

I still like the share issue thing and the auction. These are better things comparing to Steam. Goods growth however doesn't convince me in Age of Steam. I still prefer Steam's version on this matter.

I tend to dislike Martin Wallace designs, but this was pretty good. The constant struggle to avoid bankruptcy and still getting ahead is quite some experience. Too bad that once this struggle is over, the last few turns end up being nothing more than optimizing exercises and eking out a few more points (something many of Wallace's games suffer from). But still, a very fine game that I'd like to play more often.

I couldn't see big differences between this and the 'standard' version of Steam. I like the basis maps of Steam better, so I kept that and traded away AoS. AoS has the definite advantage of having more expansion maps abvailable, but I don't see myself playing this often enough to warrant purchasing additional maps.

I'm not sure where to rate this.  On one hand, I thought it had good potential, yet on the other hand nobody made even a single dollar of profit in the first half of the game.  I'm confused that there would be so little money, and people have to take that many shares.  Maybe I'm just used to railroad tycoon.

RATING: 9.7
Best train game? well, it can't replace 18xx in my opinion, but I can't see eveer turning down a game of AoS.  18xx is a much deeper but also longer game, and unlike this, has no luck whatsoever.  That said, this is about as close to as fun for me as it's possible to get.  The hard scrabble for funds at the beginning is fun and interesting--compared to the brutality of a vicious 18xx train-rush it is more player-friendly.  And although it is possible to go bankrupt and get removed from the game it will only be due to poor math skills vs game-mechanics.  In 18xx you can be forced into bankruptcy by the competition if you don't adequately protect yourself--ability to add cost vs income on the next turn isn't what'll kill ya.

[3 plays] This is just the type of game I like.  Fairly simple to learn, but lots of hard decisions to make to get the best move.  All three plays have been 6 player games.  I love railroad themed games.  I love the calculating, planning, management style game this is.  Really I would love to play this more often and get better at the strategy.  So far I have played it about one per year and have forgotten how it works and need to relearn it from scratch each time vs getting better at the strategy.

RATING: 8
[Warfrog 2nd (2002) edition] {Railroad business; dice-rolling, action-drafting, auction, variable-player-order, pick-up-and-deliver, player elimination; optimal 4p} AoS is a nice pick-up-and-deliver game. The many expansions add different 'tastes' and fun to the game, which makes AoS highly replayable. It's highly interactive, depending on the maps and # of players.

AoS is deep and unforgiving.  It requires careful planning for at least the next 2 turns; otherwise, one will have trouble in maintaining cash flow. Players have many tactical options. Building definite long-term strategies is slightly constrained due to the random goods assignment. Goods growth is the only random factor in AoS (Martin Wallace doesn't like perfect information game). Some players may find it too random to control; esp. when they are not good at making decisions based on partial information or calculating risks. 

AoS is a really good game. It's a pity that I can't bring it to table often because it's difficult to gather an appropriate group of players.

Would like to play more. I like the game length, simple mechanics , and interesting decisions.  There is something about the goods replentishment scheme that I dislike.  It adds a significant random element to the game.  If there was a slight modification I could see this as being even better.  Update 06/06  still a good game and while I don't feel it's 100% there, I still would play upon request.

This game has a fair amount of depth.  Takes a little while to figure out the rules becuase there's a lot going on but once you get over the inital learning curve it's great.  Trick seems to be finding the right balance between going into debt (selling shares) and maximizing returns on the capital you've raised.  Note to newbies: the economy in this game is BRUTAL!  It's very easy to go bankrupt fast.  I could see my rating going up with repeated plays. I can't imagine my rating going down.

Classic game that suffers from a few major problems. The dice rolling to determine cube allocation can really give one player a huge advantage if they get a few cubes at the start with an already existing track.

Plus, the game is overly brutal which says a lot coming from someone who enjoys "In The Year of the Dragon." Still, "Age of Steam" is an interesting game I do enjoy playing from time to time... but mainly as a nostalgia factor and not as a "good game" one.

A great game. I don't fancy the risk of player elimination, but I guess thats all part of the nature of the game, and could be seen as a strength too, as if people take a big risk, they will need to face the consequences. I just need to take care, that this isn't the first game to hit the table on a game night, potentially putting someone outside early on.

I was afraid about a game based on hex map with train, similar (in appearance only) to 18xx series. No problem, this is far away from 18xx games.

Lots going on and still learning.  The situational bidding is really interesting. Taking the correct action at the right time can really turn a game around or lose it for you.  The randomized placement of cubes for delivery make every game different.  Knowing where to start laying track and having an idea of your end game state  is key.   

Rust Belt: Played this with 4 players and it felt pretty good.  The placement of cities along the perimeter forced interaction between players.  Good introductory map.

AoS has evolved into one of my favorites that I don't get to play often enough.  Long term planning, short term tactics and cutthroat play make for a great game.  The main reason that I can rate it a 10 however, is the availability of all the expansion maps.  I cannot see this game ever growing stale.

First game based on solo, looks like a cutthroat strategy game. Might raise its ratings with actual plays with more players. 

070709 - Played the 2nd game as my friend decided to teach the game to me, lost horribly. But i found out that he taught the game wrongly, was a rather sour experience.
After re-reading the rules, found that its a gem waiting to be uncovered, and somewhat feels samey to Brass, though is slightly heavier? Only more plays will tell. 

100707 - Played with a better set of rules, came in 2nd in a 3 player game, also felt a better game this time. Rules are however still not 100% sure, some more abiguities but surely a great game already. raised ratings to 8.5

This game is unforgiving of mistakes. On my second game I bought one share less than I should have and lost four income (a lot for early in the game). I spent the rest of the game just trying to keep from going broke. I still think that it's a good game.

It seems common for people to forget who's turn it is and take their own before they should. This may be due to the turn order changing and some special cards, but I like to think it's because people are excited to take their turn. Someone in our group observed that three people were standing up while they were playing. I think that's a good sign.

Games tend to go long with 5 players (~3.5 hours).  I can never do as much as I want to while playing the game, and I can't stop trying to figure out strategies when I'm not playing.

Huge brain burner - I love this game. Add in the expansions and you now have a game that is more accessible to new players and quite varied for the experienced player. I finally bumped it up to a 10 - its not perfect but I'll play this over other games almost every time.

UPDATE: After giving it a 10, I'm dropping it down to a 8. I still love it, but I think Steam fixes a couple of things (mainly the goods and production action) and makes for a much more streamlined game. If I wanted to play Age of Steam with the Steam game, I could do so very easily.

After numerous plays, my assessment below still pretty much stands. However, I traded the game away nonetheless because it wasn't making it to the table. The game length always felt one or two rounds too long in a game that is already on the longer side. In addition, it doesn't handle lower player counts as well as some of my other economic games, which is important to me. Finally, as far as train games are concerned, this fit an odd middle ground between something like Chicago Express on the shorter end and 1830 on the long side. I'd still gladly play, but I don't really miss owning a copy. Such is the life of a man lucky enough to have a robust game collection.

---

After two plays on the Rust Belt map, I can see why this game is so highly regarded. Very tight. Unforgiving in a good way. I can see this becoming one of my favorites. The only downside is the runaway leader issues that some people dislike so much. Personally, even when I'm losing I tend to enjoy the game because I can always challenge myself with secondary objectives. It plays to my cutthroat gaming preferences I suppose.

Additional plays leave me wondering if this game doesn't go on for one or two turns too many. Even when the game is close, it does seem to take a while. Many times, though the winner is clear. Are those last two turns really necessary?
	
"Let's get the basics down: First, this game doesn't like you. It doesn't like anybody else either, but it particularly doesn't like you. If you ever have a question on the rules or how the rules apply to a particular situation then pick the answer that hurts the most. You'll almost certainly be right."

This game was my obsession for a while, and I'm glad to say that after playing it a bit, the obsession is over, but this is definitely still a game I will play.

The only serious problem with the game is that it's easy to fall out of contention early in the game, and once that happens, you just go through the motions for the rest of the game.

This rating reflects the game system as a whole; the Rust Belt map that comes with Age of Steam rates a 6 for me (though I think it's a great map to teach the system).

What can I say? I like to ship things! But I also like the beginning of the game when things are so tight and tense and you're furrowing your brow double-checking your math to make sure your brilliant opening plan won't bankrupt you. And I like the middle of the game where you are racing to beat your fellow track-layers to your preferred goods. And I like the end of the game where your eyes are scurrying about the board trying to find that one 6-link delivery that will seal your victory. Oh, right, and I also love raucous auctions! And multiple strategy options! The only thing I don't like is those weird intersecting track tiles. Don't understand them, don't like them. Back in my day, we just built one straight track and blew up anything in its way, even the depot if we were feeling ornery!

My number one game for so many reasons. It's tight, tense, and mean. There are tons of expansion maps available and they all change the game a bit. It's great!

It feels like this is a big puzzle.  If you spend enough time studying the cubes on the board and in the resupply chart, you can figure out the best place to start -- and after that, there aren't as many real decisions to make.

 I love this game but find it hard to bring it to the table. The wife does not like it very much. It just feels very tense and can get very crowded with rail networks on the board very quickly. Plan to play this again soon.

 Just got this to the table again and man I do miss playing this gem of a game. Very fun.

Tight economics and tense jockeying for position (both on the board and in the auction) make for an excellent game.  The multitude of expansions keep every game fresh - I don't think I've played any board more than twice yet.  Even with the same board, the cube distribution alters the landscape so significantly that I can't imagine two games feeling the same.  So much of the game depends on early choices that we always take our time at the outset to let people decide on their course of action.  I have the second edition, and prefer the wooden components and minimalist board and tile design.  We do play with clay poker chips, as the tokens that come with the game are rather cheesy.

Hard to believe that I didn't play this until 2011 given my love of heavy economic games, in particular those involving trains. I had previously played Railroad Tycoon and its successors a handful of times, Steam once and the Early Railways once. I quickly saw this as the best of the lot for me. Wonderfully brutal, necessitating short-, medium- and long-term planning, and cutthroat.  This has all the elements of heavier games that I like. The huge number of expansion maps seem to offer almost unlimited variability among different numbers of players and small rules variations. I own perhaps a half dozen other maps, but haven't even had the opportunity to break them out yet. I'm really hoping to get more regular plays of this in 2012.

RATING: 9
Initial rating based only on short plays, but this game is exactly one for me.

RATING: 10
Intense game.  My head hurts just thinking about it.  Challenging, interactive, alot of player control.  Decisons, decisions, decisions.  Interesting looking board to look at.  Who could ask for more?  The decision now is what expansion map to pick up.  Its actually really nice for the fact that a sixth player adds a considerable amount of chaos, which subtracts from downtime and necessity of skill.  The fact that the game can be a no luckbrain burner or a skill game with minimal luck depending on the number of players is fantastic.  Incredibly well designed, and scaled.  Thanks.

5 plays in, I feel like I am beginning to see the clever moves.  I am by no means an expert after five plays, but the game play has started to "slow down" and the amount of information and decisions are becoming quite managable.

UPDATE:  Yeah, its awesome.  Its the only game I can think of where I sit there and stare at the board looking for my best move instead of a good move.  Lots of fun. Lots of think.  Lots of railroad tracks.  I need to get up to speed... keep losing.

RATING: 10
Brutal, challenging, and completely unforgiving game... I can't wait to try it again! -- UPDATE: I've now had a chance to play Age of Steam 21 times, and I can say for certain that it deserves a solid 10.  It is undoubtedly one of the best board games ever designed.  The game presents players with countless decisions to make and the decisions are meaningful, which is really what I want out of a game.  However, it's not a particularly "friendly" game, so I suggest only playing with people who won't mind a pretty vicious game (Ticket to Ride this is not, by a long shot).  Finally, I should say that the additional maps available for this system make it even better.  I love how each of the other maps can completely change the game without forcing you to learn an entirely new ruleset.  You simply learn one or two rules changes and then you're ready to try Age of Steam on a totally new map.  I have a feeling that this will stretch the replayability of this game immeasurably.

I own the following 16 maps for Age of Steam: Rust Belt, England, Ireland, Western US, Germany, Scandanavia, Korea, France, Italy, Scotland, Alpha Centauri, Japan, Disco Inferno, Soul Train, Sun, and London.

UPDATE: I did not remotely understand how interesting this game was from reading the rules. It seemed like a whole lot of phases per turn, but it all just seemed to boil down to building track and shipping cubes to cities of the same color, which didn't sound all that interesting or compelling. I let this one sit on the shelf for much longer than it ever should have and I didn't think I'd ever need any expansion maps, but now over 20 games later and with 14 maps in my collection (paltry compared to some I know), I get it, I get why this one keeps people, including me, coming back and playing it again and again, and buying more and more maps. It's finally a eurogame that rewards long-term planning and not just short-term tactics, it's a game where you can have a completely new experience on a new map without having to learn a whole new set of rules, just a tweak here or there and you've got an entirely different experience, but 4 people who've played the base map before can just jump right in without any noticeable start-up time. The rules paradoxically make it seem both overly complicated with lots of phases and intricate rules for replacement/redireting but also too simple to hold my interest since it's just laying track and shipping cubes, but it turns out it's neither of those things in practice, but instead is one of the most interesting and engaging board games I've ever played.

I don't understand why I suck at this.  No, wait.  Yes I do.  It's because I keep forgetting to look at the replacement cube distribution before I build from a city that's going to end up with the same-colored cubes on it - when the same-colored cities are on the other side of the board.

RATING: 7
(1 play) Wow. What I really like about this game is that there are lots of non-obvious decisions, and the decisions matter. It's true it's rather vicious in the opening, until the income gets going, but with a bunch of players that can deal with that... I can't wait to play again. Not a 9 only on principle of no more than an 8 on the first play.

RATING: 10
A brilliant rail game for gamers. It is meaty, cutthroat,  with tantalizing decisions every turn. Best rail game from Martin Wallace. His other creation (Railways of the world) is the most fun rail game for casual play. Best rail game for families is ticket to ride.

RATING: 8
The game is about building track to get irregularly appearing cubes from one city to a city of the same color as the cube. You make more the further the cube travels, ideally on your own track; you can use others' track as well but they get a corresponding cut. The deliveries you make pay from then on, not just one-time.

It feels like running a business: You have expenses to pay off but it may be hard to estimate how much money you will be able to bring in at a given time. If you can't pay your bills with cash, you must take cuts in income. It could result in a downward spiral.

I like this type of non-combat but map-based game where the particular map used makes a big difference, and players' actions on the map affect each other greatly, though perhaps in subtle ways.

...Some things I don't like: It's hard to incorporate the randomness of regenerating products [or rather, the complexity of the production situation] into my planning. Two, when delivering goods, you may have to stare at the board and count up rail links for a long time to figure out the indisputable best move. And three, the scoring doesn't take many things into consideration, making it tie-prone. Perhaps also the income reduction mechanic acts as a rubberbanding (catch-up) mechanism. (Some say its purpose is not to be a catch-up mechanism or even that it doesn't have that effect, but I disagree with the latter, as it does work towards eliminating distinctions among players' income. Taken to an extreme no one would ever pull ahead of anyone else.)

...Having played a few maps I'm upping to 8.0 and adding to my top 10. I like how each map feels like a new puzzle to figure out.

...I think in theory I don't care for Urbanization (player ability to create new cities on the map). I feel the effect of it is so great that it lessens the feel of distinctiveness of expansion maps. Also not really in love with how much analysis is required to understand the Production situation in a given game.

...I think this game is a brilliant example of incorporating long- vs. short-term considerations in a game. You know what you want your network to look like and that you need to race other players to get the best spots. But you also have to be mindful of what deliveries are actually currently available, so that you're not funding everything with loans.

Six plays in and I still do not get this game. When I think I have learnt something and try to put it to use I still lose badly. I see the greatness in the design (despite the use of dice to determine which goods will come out when) but I fear it might just not be for me.

Be warned, this is the cruelest train game I have played so far! It's quite difficult to just manage your game, you constantly have to take loans and have to be able to bare the costs. One wrong decision and you might quite soon lose the game with bankruptcy. I would still like to play it again but "Railways of the World" is undoubtedly better choice for easier gameplay.

[rated 2008/02/13, based on 4 logged plays and several pre-logging]

Scratches my tile-laying route-building itch, without the stock-market shenanigans of 18xx, but substitutes goods-shuffling and very tight money management.  Makes my brain hurt, but in a good way.

Still an excellent game, but really no reason to own both this and Steam - sold.

A favorite of friends, and (so far) hard (impossible) to win.  It is full of problems I find with multi-player games (death spiral, having your goals completely eradicated before your turn comes up, being ganged up on, king-making, MONEY IS EXTREMELY TIGHT, etc.) Still, it stands as the very best of its kind, with many expansions to add to its allure.

Lots of interesting stuff built around a core mechanism that is essentially flawed: namely that the most lucrative way to deliver something from A to B is not to go directly from A to B, but to instead go through irrelevant cities C, D, and E.  Now, there can be situations where hubs and spokes make sense; unfortunately, this game doesn't present one.

The result is a completely artificial game that, along with its various cousins, just doesn't work for me.

Good game (2nd ed.). And despite the poorly written rules quite easy to explain. The game has a very solid feel to it, and it seems to be very well balanced. Considering the many options you have each turn, downtime is minimal due to the fact that all players step to the phases of a turn together. All in all, the only thing that bothers me about this game is that it is quite unforgiving for its relative length.

I want to play this more, and I want to play this well. The feeling is fantastic as you fight yourself out of the mire of debt.

One of the most disappointing things about this game are the components. The third edition has terrible plastic trains which I replaced with wooden pieces similar to the ones found in 2nd edition. The wooden cubes for goods come in terrible colours (and by terrible I mean, distinguishing between blue and purple is a nightmare) which I've also replaced. And not to mention the awful paper money which I've replaced with a poker chip set. 

If I didn't love this game so much, I wouldn't have gone to all the trouble!

This seems like a very strong game, but it seems like a poor beginning strategy can really sink you quickly. Still, despite the royal last-place thumping I took, I enjoyed the game. It's a little similar to Powergrid in some aspects, I think. Presentation keeps it from ever getting to the table, and it will be replaced by Railroad Tycoon, more than likely. I traded it away since I think that RT will hit the table much more often when it comes out.

I didn't go into debt on my first play.  That counts for something.  AoS gave me that tense stomach churning feeling that indicates a good game.

Update: I love it.

RATING: 8
Amazingly intense game. The economic system is as tough as described but is actually one of the coolest parts of this game. It gives a real world feel to building a company while trying to stave off the bankrupcy. My 8 rating is due to having only played one game and dur to the fact that there are some serious 'screw you' tactics available in the end game. Not being able to urbanize for four turns in a row (despite bidding 3-5s for starting position) seriously impacted my position in the end game. I'll try out Railroad Tycoon before making a final decision on which to buy!

It's a real breainburner and seems a bit unforgiving. There is a lot of tension on hoping your cubes don't get stolen. I kinda like it, but the train theme isn't my thing, it moves too slowly and requires a bit too much accounting to feel fun. Perhaps if I played fewer than 6 it would move faster, but then it might not be tight enough. However, it's fun to build tracks and ship cubes.

The artwork is kind of bland, but it's functional.

My impressions of Age of Steam have certainly been going through a bit of a rollercoaster.  First, I was really impressed.  But playing it a few more times, I grew disillusioned with the gamey-ness of certain parts of the game (in particular the cuts on the income track - I'd rather seen it split in more areas for a smoother progression from 0 to -8 or more - and the gamey effects of how payments for delivery work; which brings the effect that when taking a goods from a city to a neighbouring city, it's to my benefit to transport it via a long circuitous route).

Then, finding and playing 1825 made me see by comparison how tacked on the theme feels here.  Even though I had been negatively surprised when playing this before by the number of 'gamey' tactics that were needed, things that made no sense according to the theme of running a transportation business, but helped one perform well in the game, it wasn't until compared against the robustness of 18xx-games that Age of Steam really fell in my opinion.  Also more of a glaring annoyance in AoS when compared with the 18xx are the random elements, which even though small can still wreck carefully laid plans.

1825, on the other hand, it feels like things make much more sense, in the term of actually running railroad companies and investing in them.

As of lately, however, I've come to appreciate Age of Steam a bit more again.  Yes, it still tend to devolve into very gamey playing at times - but the early turns, struggling to make a profit, evoke an excellent feeling of being on the brink of financial ruin rare in economic games.  Some of the 18xx games match this by virtue of a harsh train rush... but apart from that, not many games come close as far as having to struggle against a tight economy to even survive goes.

RATING: 7
Not the type of game I like, but such an excellent specimen of its type that I enjoy myself anyway.  I see why there are people who play this and nothing but this.  It really has the potential to be that absorbing.  I really dig the positional and spatial aspect of this game, something which an economic game needs if it's going to keep my attention.  Took me one play losing terribly before I was able to be competitive, but it was worth it.

First game of Age of Steam. Great game, great tension, and there are obviously some mistakes that are not so obvious that I will not make next game... So I might up the rating somehow, because this game was won around turn 5 (out of 7) by a friend...

I fell in love with the blandness of the visual aspect. Very sparse, terse and inviting. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to get the amount of play time it deserves as players are lacking. I've even made several maps for it. Must play this delightful game more!

I finally managed to play this game. One play of Railroad Tycoon years ago and a fresher 1856 behind I was not totally a newbie, but there were still lots of things I couldn't handle. A gamers game, don't play this with casual players during a nice evening.

Small amount of rounds make every turn very important and you need to optimize your moves and money. Clever game. Looks good.

AOS has a bit of a steep learning curve first time out, but is well worth learning the ropes.

It is a demanding game but also a very rewarding one.  I find myself wanting to play it over and over again to correct my mistakes from the last game.

It is an engaging game that constantly forces you to make agonizing decisions and plotting and changing  strategies.

The original cube transport game.  I've played its successors (Railroad Tycoon, Steam, and Via Nebula) and yet I still prefer the original, warts and all.  I love how unforgiving AoS is.  The struggle to get a railroad empire up and running feels more realistic.  I love how operating costs continue to impede your income forcing you to continually find ways to expand.  Love this game!

 'Age of Steam' is similarly themed to that old Waddington's standby; 'Railroader' where players are American rail barons competing to lay down iron rails between cities and towns, to create the lengthiest, and therefore most profitable routes, over ten turns. They can use various card options, drawn in player turn order, that changes over each turn,according to the priority (one through seven) on the card used from the preceding turn. Like any new ganme, it will take a few plays to learn all the nuances, one of which is to maximise the number of links, short or otherwise, that allow you to ship goods along your own lines rather than somebody elses. You also need to watch out for building links across hills and rivers ad these cause your creditors to come a knockin' all too soon and can cost you victory points for going into debt. I would certainly play again.

The base game has some niggling issues, but the core ideas that have found themselves implemented into a plethora of variant maps are nothing short of brilliant. My favorite map is Montreal Metro, but there are other great maps, each with their own unique and interesting twists. The Age of Steam "universe" certainly has a place in the hall of fame of games.

RATING: 10
GAME SYSTEM: This is, remains, and will always be a 10 for me.  After about 6 plays, I realized that I loved this game for many reasons, and I simply can't imagine ever not wanting to play this game.

Age of Steam gets a bad rap for being a heavy game, but it's not really that bad.  I think people see that the game is UNFORGIVING, and assume that it must be a heavy game, but the turn order makes sense, and flows logically from one point to the next.  There are certainly some angsty moments as the game attempts to squeeze the life out of you, and there are some incredibly tense moments as you attempt to out-think other players in what special action they may choose, and then wait to see what they're going to do.  Overall, though, this is probably better classed as a medium-weight game system, with the possibilities of certain expansion maps making the game that much harder.

Speaking of expansion maps, this is a large part of what made this game a 10 for me.  The base map is fine, and is a great introduction to the system, but that the system is versatile enough to allow for different adjustments and tweaks for different maps makes the game that much more appealing to me.  There are so many different maps, that provide so many different takes on the system, that it's hard to imagine the game ever getting old.  Even if you wind up playing the game on the base map, if it's been several months and several games since you played on it, the experience will still be new.

Furthermore, playing different games on the same map will show you how the system really adapts for replayability, because a previous game may have given the impression that a particular map was easy, when in reality it was the goods distribution that made it so.  Play the same map again, and you may find that the goods come out in such a way as to make it impossible to make a first turn delivery like you were hoping to do.

Versatile.  Replayable.  Challenging.  Crushing.  It's everything a game should be for me, and THAT is why it's a 10.

-----

RUST BELT: This is probably the best map to introduce new players to the game, just because it's the least quirky and the most accessible.  France is gentler, but not as challenging, and the Rust Belt doesn't have all the wild rules to wrap your head around like some of the later maps.  It also plays well with larger numbers, which is good, since many of the later maps work best at lower numbers.  That being said, though, I tend to play the expansion maps more than I do this one.

RATING: 10
My favourite game. It's intense, no game plays the same. Every time I play the game I'm really impressed by it's sheer possibilities of choices. Understanding the game system isn't that hard, but to play it well is! To get the best out of your turns is a game on it's own; where to build, which goods to deliver or withhold, when to upgrade your engine, how many to bid for turn order for getting the role you need, should I sell more shares...choices, choices! It's often called a gamers game, but I really think people who like to be challenged will enjoy this game. If you only play to win, it's a gamers game... but if you like playing a game because it starts possessing your body and soul than AoS is a must buy. After each session I've played I feel like I've been in a gamers rollercoaster. Every game it astonishes me how inventive other players can be, making moves or builds I didn't see. The first sessions AoS played with me, after that I've learned to play with AoS. That's the moment where players recognize it's sheer brilliance! AoS is the only game I've bought twice (the new second edition), a truly 10!

Nice game wrapped in grotesquely dull trappings. Mildly fussy due to poor rules, but really flows nicely after practice. Wish the roles were a bit more balanced, but I guess that's a feature and a bug. Given it, I wish finer gradations in bidding were possible (e.g., converting all payouts, debts, etc. to x10 would enable a vastly more interesting auction).

Volldampf taken to a new level. Only the extra time to play will stop it from completely replacing the earlier game. Very, very tight money management and never enough actions to achieve everything you want (need) to do. Turn order auction and roles integrate well to give a lot of tension.

Welcome to the Wallace/Bohrer war!

Potentially interested in the FRED edition,  but equally interested in the Rails of the World/Steam.

But this (the meatier older brother) might do.  Deal-breaker for me will be presentation (and things like if the map is mounted)...and if I can play with a more relaxed ruleset.

Although I love auctions,  they're also what I perceive as "designer laziness", so maybe Steam is what I'm looking for...

AoS is a great game with lots of interactions between players. The rules are super-simple despite its strategic depth. However, since (cooperative) kingmaker problem does exist, this game is far better when played among experts.

That said, the downside is that beginners can easily get knocked out. Also, first-turn moves, including starting position, is so important that it often determines the winner by the early stage of the game. Then, the rest of this LONG game is quite pointless, unless people care about the second place.

The basic system is wonderful -- and that's why I love Steam.

But in AoS, if you make ONE mistake, you probably won't win. And if you make two, you'll probably get eliminated altogether.

Remember when we said that Euros were great because everyone kept playing until the end of the game (and everyone had a shot at victory, unless they really screwed up)?
Well, in that respect, AoS feels like a serious step backwards. 

People saying they prefer AoS over Steam *because* it's much more brutal and unforgiving sounds to me more like macho bullshit than anything else.
Take my first game: in turn 1, I made a $1 mistake, and it was immediately clear to everyone around the table (including me) that there was no way I was going to be able to recover from that mistake.
And that's supposed to be fun? 

To me, Steam's a 9. But I have to take one star away from AoS for its "make one mistake and you're dead" attitude, and a second star away for introducing randomness (goods cube distribution) in such a long-winded, calculatory game.

A rail game that involves optimization of shipping goods from one city to another.  Very similar to Railroad Tycoon.  The queued production boxes, and fixed future cities are nice elements that allow a player to formulate an early strategy.  Probably the trickiest thing is getting initial money from shares is not an instantaneous operation, hence AOS punishes a player more for bad planning.

My #1 top-rated game.

OK, I'll say it.  I like games that are mean-spirited.

If there's ever a rules question in AoS, the rule should always be interpreted in such a way that it punishes players the most - and that will always be the correct interpretation.

In AoS, players are also given the opportunity to be mean to each other.  Repeatedly, but in a strategic way.  I like that.

The original version, without expansions, would probably get an 8 or 9.  But the original + entire line of expansions gets a 10, since I have a hard time separating one from the other.

Played quite a lot (including plays of expansion maps). A rather demanding game, but well worth the effort in my opinion. It has interesting mechanisms (such as the auction system or the turn order with First build and First move actions) and the basic system is really adapted to expansions tweaking a few rules at a time. Unfortunately, the game might be a bit long (meaning there can be a runaway leader early enough, or on the contrary that an early mistake is likely to keep you out of the game for good). Also, the base map is not the most interesting one. I would rather suggest France or Ireland with 3 or 4 players, and England or Germany for 5 or 6 players.

- At times the production die can help a player to win.

After my first game of AoS I can understand why this game is such a succes and bought one copy down here at the marketplace. I loved the game for 2 reasons: i/ I didn't bankrupt, something I thought I would in my 1st game and ii/ My brain felt tired for 30 minutes after the game ends and I had to drink a couple o good beer to get back on my feet again. My major mistakes were: i/ I didn't use the 3 tiles for buiding links twice (and I coud have); ii/ delayed to improve engines and iii/ actually a minor mistake, playing using the Force, haven't paid much attention how much I should have paid on Auctions.

Initial comments circa 2006:  Tight and challenging game.  Not as brutal as I thought it would be given its reputation.  Plenty to think about.  Very engaging throughout.  No downtime.

July 5, 2012: Well, I've gotten 19 plays of it in, and I think I've got a pretty good sense of what the game has to offer and how to play well.  I've just decided that what it takes to play well isn't something that I find that fun.  While I like a lot of games in which you have to think hard, I don't enjoy the things that I have to think hard about in Age of Steam.  With the level of play in our group, it's become a very deep, cold calculation of route-planning and cube-seeking.  That's starting to seem too much like work.  So, I either can try to play optimally and not have that much fun or play sub-optimally and just enjoy the experience.  There are certainly games--Through the Ages comes to mind--that I enjoy for the experience even when I'm doing poorly, but Age of Steam isn't evocative enough to fall into that category.  So, while the different situations that Age of Steam and its various expansions offer are diverse, I don't find the central engine of the game engaging anymore.

A brain burner of joy!! Shorter than the 18xx games I love, but has a great many decisions to make and almost always keeps my brain working when it is not my turn. Luck is greatly reduced (only really involved in 'Production'). The initial layout of goods, while random, is there for all to see and bid what they feel is reasonable.

Age of Steam ('Rust Belt' – the original) I am using as the representative for the entire series of maps published. My current favorite is Exp#3 – Korea.

What a fantastic game! Got it in a math trade, played it for the first time and couldn't stop thinking about it for two days. Tons and tons of depth without unnecessary rules complexity. Slight hint of randomness means no plan is entirely fool proof, though the better player will definitely win. From 'never considered it' to a favorite in only a few weeks. This one is here to stay!

Ooh.  A game with some real meat (i.e. little luck.

As there are more than 100 boards, I expect my rating to increase to 9/9,5 once I'm more experienced.

Actually "painful" at times.  Very unforgiving, and not quite fun.  Although train-games not my bag, this still lacking something more than just not tickling my fancy . . . and I cannot figure that out, as I really like Railroad Tycoon.

Fantastic game! Played a 4 player session recently that was exciting and very involving. This is a game upon which you have to focus your attention constantly. Some might call this brain burn, but I it&#039;s more like intense fun! Our session lasted about 2 hours...2 hours very well spent. Highly recommended!!...UPDATE: Played a 6 player game recently. A bit more chaotic than playing with 4 people, but still quite manageable and enjoyable!

Absolutely great train-game. It beats 1830 because of the easier rules and more options. Also, it's a tad more random, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Allways willing to play this one, though after some plays it tends to become a bit repetitive. Time to play the new maps!

One of the best games I've ever played. Players try to make the most of his rails, by transporting goods from one point to another. Lots of competition in a very simple yet though to master game. Must have!

Rating just the base game it would be around an 8. Easy rules to learn and play, the interaction is excellent, The mechanisms work incredibly well together. The expansion maps alter the game slightly and make it feel different and add to the replay ability.

Eagle Games edition, which includes the bonus Barbados/St. Lucia map. Complete. Game parts are sorted and bagged. Includes extra locomotives. The game box has no dents, dings or shelf ware. (It looks like a just opened copy.)

Played my first game of this - 3 player. I was very pleasantly surprised by how efficiently the mechanics are implemented. Viewed from afar it looks like it's going to be quite complex and heavy with lots of rules. There ARE a whole tonne of choices to be made each turn and it's hard to recover from a poor start. The mechanics are great and teh game flows well. VERY LITTLE luck and genuine equial opportunity for players at the start of the game. GREAT. I may even buy a copy! (Update: I did)!

The fact that 'Rails to Riches' exists curbs my desire to play this fine game.  I'll certainly still enjoy when it hits the table, but given the choice, RtR is played.

This feels like a game that needs more than one play to appreciate, so I'm still wanting to give this one another shot.  The auction for turn order left a bad taste in my mouth with the player to your immediate right playing a HUGE factor in how well you do.  The track placement and good shipping made for a lot of tough decisions.  The production quality is just pathetic compared to your average Euro.  Maybe I'm spoiled by the likes of Power Grid or El Grande and the generic money counters and bland board were influencing my opinion of the actual game hiding beneath it all.  The kingmaker element seems out of control, but maybe if everyone is fairly competitive it won't be such a big deal.

theoretically i like this game more than a 7, but i'm so bad at it, that it pisses me off, so i take off a point or so.  i've done better in recent games, so i bumped this to an 8.  the expansions seem like cool fun too.  doesn't this game just grow on you, though?  bump again.  more maps == better.  always willing to play.  On third thought, after many years, this game is almost too harsh.  Steam, the reimplementation, is much more fun, and softer.

RATING: 5.5
Very disappointed in the game. I've played very few games with more down time and less to do while you twiddle your thumbs waiting. The game rewards over analysis, and has no pace or cadence. Each turn can be analyzed to the Nth degree, and it boils down to mathematical projections and an ability to locate mathematically superior moves on the board. So rather than making clever or strategic plays, it's about spotting mathematics. I'm not good at these types of games, as I'm not willing to spend the time (ie, drag the game out) to map out every possible permutation of my turn actions. Horribly unforgiving game, as it seems like early mistakes can doom you from the start. That wouldn't be bad in a short game, but for such a long game, you could easily find yourself playing with no motivation for a long time. I can also see how one player feeling out of it could simply call it quits and declare a winner by shipping along another player's route, as the game features several elements which could be exploited for kingmaking. There are far many better games where I feel more involved and have more fun along the way.

I finally had the opportunity to play a game of Age of Steam at Incognicon 12 with Johan (30ought6) and one of his friends. The game is a brutal economic game, and I tend to enjoy games that are unforgiving, but this one didn't thrill me to the point of feeling like I need to seek it out again or own it myself.

Possibly the most notable and well received of all the pick up and deliver titles.  Age of Steam offers a rich gaming experience filled with frustration, angst and at times satisfaction (your mileage may vary).  It is one that rewards those that can plan ahead without being distracted by the immediate gratifications.  While the game is very unforgiving, I don't think it's extraordinarily difficult to perform well in a given session, especially with good money management.

Fairly steep learning curve, but I was proud that besides the opening move, I played the rest of the game without any assistance.  Kudos to a fantastic design, I am still thinking about strategy long after the game is over, totally eager to play again soon!

Phenomenal train game.  Emphasize to new players just how tight money is at the beginning of the game, and how costly mistakes are early in the game.  Update: After more plays, this definitely gets a 10.  I would play this any time, it's just that good.

It's a good clash for hard boardgamer, but not much to replay.
You have to plan your obs very well and hope that nobody is thinking to reach the same goal.

Brilliant mechanic. Even if there is a kind of "rich get richer syndrom" in the last part of the game. Could have given a better rating, but, despite my admiration, it's a little bit too abstract to become one of my true favourites.

RATING: 7.5
2008-11 [b][bgcolor=#99ffff] 7 [/bgcolor][/b] In my first play, like my first play of [thing=9440]Maharaja[/thing], there were several rules I'd misunderstood, and it took the first couple of rounds (a significant percentage) to unravel those misconceptions.  Unlike [thing=9440]Maharaja[/thing], [thing=4098]Age of Steam[/thing] will kill a man for mistakes like those.  I stayed in the game, financially, but was not competitive for first place.

I think there's an excellent game in there, but one that requires seasoned players to cleanly and quickly bring newbies up to speed if they are to be competitive - although it's more forgiving in this regard than [thing=483]Diplomacy[/thing], no question!

2015-05-05 [b][bgcolor=#80FFCC] 7.5 [/bgcolor][/b] I relearned the game with [thing=30929]Barbados[/thing], and am into it again. Getting to learn it from the rules, instead of a [i]meh[/i] teacher, has allowed me to enjoy it without brutality through misunderstanding.

After first game, I loved this game. I love that this isn't overly complicated, but keep things basically pretty simple. And I love that this can be pretty ruthless, it doesn't forgive mistakes easily. That's not always a good thing but for this game it works (at least it seems so after first play..).

Bought at GenCon 2010, I was hoping to have Martin Wallace personally sign this at a lunch we set up with him.  Only problem was I didn't know the back story of this game and felt it wasn't appropriate.  Great game though!

Best economic management game I know.   Another train game, that is deep and fulfilling.  The game can be brutal but I think that is why I like it.  I like the mechanic that you have to plan your turn and if you over spend it deeply hurts you.  Overall nice design and functional pieces.

After 1 Play: Brutally tight on money, but thoroughly enjoyable.  Don't be scared off by it's complexity.  This was my first train game, and I did just fine.

After 5+ Plays: Has become one of my favorite games.  Just a really interesting economic system that overlays a cutthroat placement game.  I am in the minority in my game group as regards my opinion of this game though, so I struggle to get it played.  So often I have to settle for Railroad Tycoon, which is enjoyable but just not in the same league as Age of Steam.

Simply superb! This is just the way I like my games, heavy and interesting all the way. The game ends just at the right moment when it would start getting dull and the map is full and all. The agony of not having enough money, not the correct 'role' and everything makes this great.

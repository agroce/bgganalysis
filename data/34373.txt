A slightly-lighter version of Knizia's [b]Formula Motor Racing[/b], except in a bigger box.  Seems that you have very limited control of the game, but the production quality is rather good.

Probably won't buy this, as FMR fits the same bill.

RATING: 6
Sometimes you come across a game targeted to the masses that isn't just a lousy game.  I had almost no expectations that this game held promise as much of anything other than an exercise in trying something new.  I was much surprised by what emerged.  There is some interesting manipulations made in the game play that actually make this an interesting filler type game.  It won't rock the world, but you can find a pretty engaging little game.  If you like ladder style scoring where you shift the value of fixed set of items, this is worth looking into.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The board and cards look a little cheap and feel that way but the Tiki's themselves are wonderful. I love the Tiki Toast action, the feel of doing it and seeing the clenched jaw. You can be very high end analytical and tack each persons play to figure out what they are trying to do or just move your Tiki up and theirs down. Quick, light, can be more, but fun. A 5 year old can play, but 8 and up are good.

A nice light game with secret goals.  I like how you have to use stealth to avoid getting your tiki's toasted.  The names are funny to say, and the game is really fast to play.  It has a bit of the feel of King Me, but with slightly different execution.  It makes for a really nice blend and is very easy to teach.

(KIDS) Not really fun enough to play with kids, but the production is of good quality.  I've updated my rating of this game after a few more plays.  It's disguised to look like you are making choices when really this is just a big pile of chaos.  The components are nice, but the game is not.  It didn't sound good from the description but a lot of recommendations from BGGers encouraged me to give it a try.  I'm disappointed with this game.

Love it and hate it! Was beaten every time I played it. There should be some tactic that I didn't/couldn't grasp.
Updated: might always have to follow the same pattern to play. If that's being the case, then it is a game heavily relies on luck. I think the action cards are too few to play it different way.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I really liked this one; very fast, the 3 rounds were over in a flash, but the rapid destruction of the tiki and the scramble to get your colours to the top was really good, if chaotic fun.  Will certainly want to play again.

This has become a family in-joke. No matter how great any game is, it doesn't hold a candle to Tiki Topple. I payed about 2.50 for it at a BN clearance sale. Had I payed more, I'm sure the joke wouldn't be very funny at all.

RATING: 5
Silly game to play either as a filler or with non gamers.  Plays fast, there appears to be some strategy, but more often than not strategy is lost because of the limited choices and the necessary for opponents to kill pieces eventually, even if they have no reason to suspect it is yours.

Not a lot of strategy "take that" game, but bits are great, and play is simple. This will make a good game to teach newbies with.  I teach a lot of games to newbies at boardgame meetups and this has earned a spot in my bag.

Only played with three.  Ok game.  There's really nothing wrong with this game; yet somehow it's not a game that I like.  It could be that I only have so much control over what happens; the rest relies on the other players not hurting me or accidentally helping me.  But I'm not sure exactly what.  I'll play it, but it's not one that I'll pick to play.

Similar to Knizia's Formula Motor Racing but more random.  Very difficult to exert any kind of control over what happens.  Victory is mostly about lucking into getting a score card with tikis that match other players.  Great components, mediocre game.

I find this to be a clever game of timing. You have to advance your colors without making it obvious what scoring cards you have.

Thrifted my copy in 2012 in perfect condition for just a couple of dollars. Very light strategy game that we have only ever played with adults and everyone has enjoyed. This is also the only game that my mother-in-law wins. She is a trooper and plays whatever we put on the table but always plays from behind so to speak and usually comes in last. For her sake this game will never leave our collection.

RATING: 5
Somewhat enjoyable, but I am not sure.  I don't know how many times I would play this game.  This game is more akin to something like Tsuro or Pentago, where you play it once with a certain gropu of people, then 2 months later you introduce it to a different group of people, and never play it again with the first gropu of people until a year later.

It is an interesting game, but it doesn't seem to have a lasting power that I would like to see in a game.

Production value is top notch.

RATING: 6
Not bad for a game that was picked up at a discount store. Tiki Topple is a very light family-weight game that involves playing cards to rearrange nine totems in different colors. Your goal is to get three colors in the top section.

I'm actually curious if there's more depth to this than at first blush. Because everyone has the same card set, it's possible to start to gage how much flexibility other players have. It's not the best thing since sliced bread, but there's plenty of other games that are worse.

RATING: 8
Another great Gamewright game for the family.  Easy enough to understand that our 4 year old can play and do well, enough going on to keep everyone interested.  Very nice components - thick cards, nice board, great wooden tiki pieces.  Another game my non-gamer husband really enjoys!  Using the Tiki Toast cards early has seemed to be a good tactic in most cases - the other cards become more powerful as the number of tikis on the board decreases but sometimes this gets you into trouble if you have to move a piece you don't want to.

Thanks Jae!  The strategic decisions in this game are overshadowed by the tiki destroying cards...at least in a 4-player game 1 of these should be removed so that the gameplay feels more meaningful.  This game woke us up after New Year's dinner and got us in the mood to play better games, so that's something, but on its own merit this feels like a game that needs to be redesigned a bit.

A good game featuring hand management and hidden objectives. Splendid components. It can be chaotic with 4 players but it's fun and plays fast. Game length is variable since you can play a set number of rounds or to a set number of points, so it can be a filler or it can be a very light main event.

I would strongly suggest removing a "Tiki Toast" card with 3 or 4 players instead of the recommended "Tiki Up" card. Otherwise the game can quickly turn into a series of toast cards played with almost no strategy.

Having said that, Tiki Topple is a great filler. The components are top-notch, the gameplay offers a bit of strategy and a bit of misdirection and luck while playing in fewer than 15 or 20 minutes. It's a fun diversion every once in a while.

This is the prettiest GameWright game I own! The pieces are solid & heavy, cards are thick & sturdy.

Play reminds me a little of Phoenix, which I also like.  Rules are few & easy, play is short.  Bought it as a child's game, but it is a good family game for all ages. A player way behind in the first half of the game can end up winning.

Looks nice and wanted to love this game, but I feel it needs houserules to work well. Certainly when playing with only 2. Perhaps make it less easy to make Tikis drop all the way ? Or play with several goal cards and keep the order after each round, so you can already work towards what will become your final goal card during the first game ... But I wonder whether in the end it's even worth the trouble ?

Tiki Topple is a silly little game with quite a few similarities to Knizia's Formula Motor Racing. It is even more chaotic due to secret player colours but on the other hand it has a little tweak to weaken the last player advantage a bit. Unfortunately, it doesn't work equally well with all player configurations (ie. it works best with 4, otherwise the most chaotic number with the smallest amount of player influence in an already rather uncontrollable game).

Quite fun to play. I was initially attracted to the silly box (admittedly). Easy game to learn and teach. Would be a good one to start the night out with for simplicity. You have a secret card for each round that defines how many points you get for having your 3 appointed Tiki at the top of the heap. Play your set of cards (everyone has the same set) to keep yours at the top. Score at the end of each round. Round depend on the number of players, but you can extend the rounds if you want to play longer.

Incredible. First I thought that it had been designed by B. Faidutti. It has some similarities with China Moon and Schildkrötenrennen, but it's shorter, it has more depth, it gives more fun and is a little bit more challenging. Pure fun.
I don't know if the ,,change positions" card doesn't give a better hand to the last player.

I've only played it once with 2 players.  I hope to try it out with 4.  But, not sure I find it that interesting.  It just seems to be 'luck' of the draw to see how close your goal compares to your opponent.   Plus, a bit of 'are they going to take one of your colors away before you move it.

Still, it's quick so that's a plus.

This is very similar to Niagra, but in a more compact form.  You have a bunch of action cards (instead of paddles) that move wooden tikis up and down a totem pole. Each player has a secret objective to arrange the totem pole in a specific fashion, in order to score the most points. However, other players are trying to do the same. At first, this can be chaotic, and seemingly random, but the keys are determining what action cards to keep in reserve, and when to make your move. Somehow, order emerges from the convoluted mess. Easy to learn, accessible to family and friends, young and old, quick to play, yet provides enough tactical depth to please more serious gamers.

One of the first Euro-style games I ever played back before I knew what that was.  Move the Tiki totems around and try to get your colors into the top slots and winning victory points over three rounds.  Fun to play every once in a while but not every game night.

RATING: 5
It seems like a player often has no play that will help that player's own position, so that player makes a play more or less at random which helps or hurts another player significantly.  Failing that, it often comes down to being lucky enough to have another player working on the same color.

Initial Rating: 4.0 (August 2017)

I bought Tiki Topple on 2013 so it took me 4 years to play it. I wasn’t expecting much from it, and, at the end of the day I didn’t like it very much.

The rules of the game are very simple, you can explain them under 2 minutes. Playtime is around 30 minutes.

The game´s components are gorgeous, the tikis (tikies?) are amazing. The art is pretty good as well.

Tiki Topple is a family level game. The game´s decisions are rather easy and obvious. It offers mainly tactics. Planning is next to impossible and if you are too obvious all other players will attack you. The best you can do is to try to bluff your way to accomplish the secret goal.

For some reason (the tittle? the cover?), when I bought the game I thought it was a dexterity game (in fact I thought it was Click Clank Lumberjack), but it is a card game.

Bottom line, Tiki Topple can be a good family game and it can be great with small children. It is way too light for my current tastes. The decisions are too obvious and you don’t need to think at all. You don´t have much control. The game can be fun with the right crowd, but I already sold my copy of the game. My desire to play it again is very low. Mindless fun.

Very simple game. Interesting idea, but I would kind of prefered to have more cards that moves downward and less cards that destroy pieces, so that you could fake pushing piece upward by pushing piece downward.

You want to be able to manipulate the board without making other suspect that you need a color. Any card that pushes you up will reveal you immediately.

Else there could be more varied action cards, like move a group of totem, switch the place of 2 totems, reverse a group of totem, etc.

*****NOTE: There are 2 different editions to this title.  Schmidt edition (square box) is different and has significantly different mixture of cards and does NOT have the same tension & gameplay.*****  

My rating is for the Gamewright (rectangular box) edition: A fun Tiki Totem Pole game of trying to outwit and outguess your opponent using movement and chopping cards.  Plays briskly and has a nice fun factor to it with outstanding game bits.  There were more strategy nuances that I discovered in several re-plays.

First, the production is top notch. I love the tiki pieces. Tiki Topple is a hand-management and line-management game that's surely influenced by [gameid=635]. Unlike FMR the tikis you're trying to score are hidden information. What's interesting is that other players are likely to be trying to score those tikis too although perhaps not in the same order. Only the top 3 tikis score and only if they've finished high enough on your score card. For example if the blue tiki is in the 2nd place position on your score card it only scores points if it finished 2nd or 1st (not 3rd).

The game feels chaotic at times but you play three rounds so it allows the nuanced strategy to influence your overall placing. My son really likes it and I can see how it's a good game for kids as the decisions to make can be quite advanced (and older children will begin to pick up on those). I'm not a huge fan though.

RATING: 6.5
An all-right filler that involves being dealt a win, place, show bet each turn, only instead of horses, you're betting on the order of tikis on a totem pole. You can influence the order of the totem pole by using action cards -- move a tiki up 1/2/3 spots, eliminate the tiki at the bottom, or topple a tiki to the bottom spot from anywhere. It's a bit rigid after a few plays, in that the game doesn't seem to open up much farther after that.

Very nice components - the tikis are vibrant colors and have a nice weight to them.  The cards are durable and should last a long time.  My boys enjoy it, and that was the goal of purchasing it - so it succeeds as a family game.

That being said - I, personally, am not a huge fan.  I feel pretty out of control as tikis get moved around and burned despite my best efforts.  I understand this is not meant to be a deep strategy game, but I am having trouble seeing much strategy at all.  Maybe its just me?  I don't think I would ever choose to play it with a group of my friends over other games in my collection.

Good game for families, not so good for gaming groups (unless your group has kids in it ;P )

I thought this game might be a light filler game.  I was disappointed with it even though I wasn't expecting much to begin with.  Seems like it could have been more interesting if the players were to draw cards from a deck instead of each player having the same cards each turn.  This would  give the game some surprise element.  Boring game with no excitement.  I can't believe it won awards.  Boggles my mind.  Wasted 20 bucks on this one.

This is seriously a cut throat game wrapped up in a seemingly kid friendly package. Easy to understand and easier to play, the real frustration can come from all your pieces being picked off before you get enough turns to impact your own score...  more mature players take that opportunity to screw their opponents back, but kids seem more apt to sulk about not scoring.

Fun "row-manipulation" game ala [b]Family Business[/b], [b]Guillotine[/b], [b]Parade[/b], and [b]Sitting Ducks Gallery[/b]. Despite there being less chance involved in many of them, it's not quite as fun as the aforementioned titles. Also, I would not play this with two players - it was somewhat dry and at times it seem impossible to get a tiki you need to the top if it starts on the bottom. With three to four, it is more fun (yet more chaotic).

[b]Update: (11/2016)[/b] Increased my score from a 6.5 to a 7. It ended up having more staying power than the other games previously mentioned (aside [b]Parade[/b] which is the best of this type of game).

An amazingly random game in which players attempt to get pieces of their choice to the top of a totem pole to satisfy secret objectives. The movement of pieces is limited by action cards, and the destructive nature of the cards places players at the mercy of each others' objectives. 

Tiki Topple has vivid visuals and the 'click-clack' sound of the totems rearranging is surprisingly soothing, but the mechanically similar [thing=7806][/thing] grants players more control and is generally the superior game of the two.

Love this one. A basic manipulate the line game where the goal is to get as many of your colour Tikis in the top 3 in a certain order.

Wifey a big fan, and goes down well with Friends and family. Great Tiki pieces as well.

This game confuses me.  It looks like it should be a dexterity game, but instead it is a hand management horse racing game with heads.  

Way too chaotic for me to enjoy it.  I'm fine with a good light game, but this just doesn't have enough control for me to feel like I'm really making a conscious difference in whether I win or lose.  The Tiki Toast cards are just too easy to use if the piece at the bottom isn't yours and too difficult to get out of your hand if your pieces keep ending up there.

Meh.

Both King Me! and Formula Motor Racing do the same kind of thing but much, much better.  Another example of what how worthless the Mensa Select Award is.

Very clever game and mechanic -- definitely useful with the kids in teaching them bluffing and strategy.  I have to say that I'm really enjoying this game -- one of the best games in the kids aisle.

Similar to many games(Formula 1 Motor Racing and Abandon Ship come to mind), but the fact that every player as the exact same hand of cards makes this a much cleaner design. 

Really fun, even more when you add tour own sound effects for topple and toast!

Not a bad filler, with some interesting elements of trying to outwit your opponents.  Still, it seemed that once people got the hang of the game, the rounds ended pretty quickly, so I'm not sure there's quite the opportunity for bluffing that the game might first present.

This one is alright, it's very chaotic, and it is very difficult to gain control on the situation in each round.  Rounds can also end very quickly, especially with more players I think.  I'd like to try it with less players, as I believe the chaos will be less, and the game will be more tactical.

I want to like this game because it involves strategy, but its lifespan on the table is extremely short. After 3 games, I just want to put it away. The game gets repetitive and boring, as we keep moving the same few pieces back and forth. Still worth playing, but is only the kind of game you put out on a coffee table for occasional guests to meddle with while waiting.

RATING: N/A
Pros: Simple, easy to teach
Fast to play
Great components and board
Works well with 2 to 4 players

Cons: Almost too simple
There should be an easier way to get lower tikis up

Conclusion: Tikki Topple reminds me of Formula Motor Racing.  I like the scoring track as opposed to a score sheet.  I wish it would have more player interaction like Formula Motor Racing.  I guess when the tiki heads are not owned by a specific player, interaction is difficult.  It's a good game for non-gamers.

6.5 for the gameplay (which reminds me of Knizia's Formula Motor Racig - but not done quite as well), and 0.5 bonus for the components which really are beautiful. The family loves it, and I like it as a family game, but it has limited plays IMO.

It's one of those games where even with a relatively low rating (currently 6.5), I'll keep ahold of it. It's in a smaller box so it doesn't take up much space on the shelf. It's quick and easy enough to teach/learn that I can use it as a unique filler. And it's aesthetically pleasing enough to add to the experience too. It's no brain burner, or anything special in terms of game play, but the sum of its parts is greater than the whole.

We actually play this with a blind draw for each player. Since it is a light game it works fine and in my opinion is far better.

RATING: 7
This is a "light" game geared toward children, but it is not random. You have a set number of cards with which to affect the tiki tower order of colors and they are the same cards your opponents have. As a result, strategic gameplay is all about knowing which cards have been played and trying to ensure your pieces wind up at or near the top of the tower at game end. The game is very accessible to children because of the simplicity, but most young children will lose overwhelmingly to adults due to the advantage adults will have at being able to "count cards" and plan moves in advance. I like this game because it encourages strategic thought in young players, but I would not play this with only adults as it would get old very fast.

RATING: 3
This was a random and senseless exercise. I cannot fathom how games like this manage to win the Mensa Select award (except for the fact that their selection process is fairly ridiculous). It's a game where everyone is trying to rearrange nine colored blocks to match their secret and randomly drawn card. Players take turns playing cards that allow them to modify the arrangement of the blocks in some way. It takes too long, builds in artificial length by requiring multiple unrelated rounds (see, e.g., Rum & Pirates), and is boring within two minutes of starting.

Quality of components is fantastic. Choices are somewhat interesting, but a lot can happen that can make this game seem a bit chaotic. Which is OK for a game that takes less than 30 minutes to play.

To be fair, the rating reflects a game that was meant for kids. The rating is meant from an adult's perspective. I personally won't play this game unless it is with other kids.

From a kids view point, it is actually a decent game. They learn how to anticipate and also bluff in terms of moving pieces. I do not like, however, the way the game is too random in terms of removing pieces.

It's almost a game, but ultimately with the card distribution how it is, it's a pretty random and frustrating exercise. It's a teal shame too, how neat the components are, but how you're not actually stacking them, nor at any point does a tiki actually 'topple'. The other shame is that this is unmistakable a horse-racing game, and the re-theme is just weird. Perhaps children found it traumatizing when the horses are shot and killed mid-race.

I bought this after seeing a positive review by Tom Vasel.  I normally appreciate his positive reviews, but on this game I feel like he might have been overly influenced by his kids - and kids tend to overly excited about games like this.  I played this with three teenagers and not one liked it.  The fun was definitely lacking - and I'm a sucker for kiddish games.  When you get beyond the colorful board and tikis there's just not much there.

Super-ultra-fantastic bits. OK, I've said something nice. It makes me feel slightly uncomfortable to bash this game, because I did  mildly enjoy it (like a "5" rating level of enjoy.) The problem (and hence the 3 rating) is because for a family + kid game it is just too mean. In Tiki Topple, each player has a set of 7 cards that re-arrange a stack of totem heads. Two of those cards remove pieces (entirely) from the game if they are at the bottom of the stack. No surprise: another card moves pieces to the bottom, making it easy to ruthlessly crush the hopes of your opponents. Both my child and my spouse (non-gamers, but we are working on that) became totally demoralized at having their absolutely-must-have-for-secret-goal pieces removed from the game for good as they were trying to accomplish said secret goals with them. For me: mean in a game can be great. Bring on Manhattan! Bring on Lifeboats, Intrigue and Diplomacy! But when I play with non-gamers the last thing I want to happen is for them to get discouraged and feel miserable. It is all about the Pavlov: make gaming feel good for 'em... make 'em drool for it! "When I ring this bell, you non-gamer, you will demand we play Age of Steam!" Or at least this is always my hidden agenda when I play with non-gamers. This game kills that project cold. So if you think TT might be interesting, help the gaming proselytizing and buy Phoenix instead. For, while the bits in this are spectacular, the bits in Phoenix are also fantastic and Phoenix does what Tiki Topple does, but much, much better-- and without the nasty spirit crushers. (What about this game for gamers? Nah, we have so many extremely great games to play. Why not just play those?)

The components are really cool, and this is a good way to introduce the concept of secret goals to your kids.  It's just the right length for what it is.  It's one of those games I don't always think about playing, but after I'm done with a game I am always surprised by how much I enjoyed it.

Like Ka-Ching!, this is a game that's a little trickier and thinkier than one would expect, given the theme, artwork, and publisher.  It's no surprise that this was a Eurogame first, because while the turns are simple and straightforward, the tactics needed to play the game will surprise you.  It seems to suggest that you should try to bluff with colors that aren't important to you, but you don't really have enough cards in hand for that sort of play, so it's all about positioning the tikis you want where you want them, and making sure you hold on to the right cards until the end of the game.  There's a neat way that you can move up a tiki using the "move to the bottom" card in your deck, which is good, since you only have four cards that allow you to move them up.  I'm not sure how much staying power it has, but it's certainly more of a game than I expected, and the tikis are some of the best bits I've ever seen.

My initial impression after playing 2 player is that it will probably be even better with 4 and that the strategy is subtle. If either of those turn out not to be true, the rating will probably drop to a 7 or maybe even 6. This is a very tense, tactical game, and not a particularly nice one either. I liked the bluffing aspects, but I fear that the game will not be able to support highly aggressive play (or that the scores will end up very low).

[b][i]Tiki Topple[/i][/b] is pleasant enough, I suppose, but compared to other pleasant, simple games, such as [i]Qwirkle[/i] or [i]Uptown[/i], I never feel like I'm making clever moves in [i]Tiki Topple[/i]. Instead I'm just doing what I can to survive. As soon as the round begins, the tide starts to push through a barrier and threaten your three tikis. You raise one tiki to safety, then another, but the water keeps flowing and soon the round ends, leaving you to survey the damage with a shrug and say, "Well, maybe it will work out better next time."

For the manufacturer recommended age of 10+ (what a joke!) this game would rate about a 5 for me; there just isn't a lot of gameplay there to keep an adult or even older child interested.  However, I think this would be a wonderful family game to play with younger kids (maybe 5-8?).  The components are also great - colorful, chunky, and fun.

I don't mind this once in awhile. I do hate that the bottom several totems can be burnt before you even get a turn, guaranteeing that you have lost one of your scoring totems. If it is your first place totem, you cannot make up that point loss for the whole round. So random luck DOES weigh in at about 65/35 against strategy. But, for being a "manipulate things in a line" game, its' theme really carries it through

This is a great light strategy abstract game for all ages!

First off, upon opening the box, the first thing anyone would notice are the very attractive game components!

The miniature tiki pieces are of superb quality, heavy and durable!  They each have a unique name (amusing at that) printed on BOTH sides which facilitates finding your "secret" tikis.

The board is also very nicely illustrated and even contains a indentation for the tiki tower to be constructed!  Gamewright thought ahead and did an excellent job making sure the pieces stayed in place during game play.

The cards are excellent as well and play into the theme quite nicely by featuring woodgrain, vivid colors and even tiki font!  

I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys light filler games, screw-your-neighbor game mechanics and the tiki motif.  You will not be disappointed!

After 1 Play: The two-player game is completely pointless.  It could be better with more players, but I doubt it.  There is no way to hide which colors you want at the top, because there aren't enough turns in a round to make progress if you spend any of them disguising your intentions.  The biggest problem though is that only the last couple cards really matter.  It reminds me of Formula Motor Racing in that respect, which is definitely not a good thing.

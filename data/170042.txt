Not a bad design, but it felt pretty abstract and there was very little tension in the game.  Found myself going about the motions.  One player also fell behind the others and there was essentially no way to catch up because of the types of workers and resources you need later in the game.  Left me not wanting to play it again.

I love this worker placement game! The mechanic of placing a worker to take an action and removing another one for 2nd action is great! With this, you don't feel like you are stuck with taking whatever action is left like other worker placement games.

Regular retail edition.  I thought I'd enjoy this more and it's a decent worker placement, just prefer Waterdeep.  Will revise rating after a few more plays.  Played it 3 times and I'll play it again, but it's not as good as Tyrants of Underdark, Waterdeep, or Agricola, imo.  It's got some fun elements and it might go up with time.  But not that 8-10 range of my favorite games.

It seems like it's raid the harbors ASAP and the the other raids aren't as interesting or profitable.  I also don't like that you have limits of 8 food and 8 coins.  I'd prefer you could collect a ton of food and coins with optimal crew builds and then go out raiding and swap out for raider crews vs. bonus crews.  Might change that from the rules so there are no limits.

RATING: 7.5
After playing again, I started to grasp some of the strategies and was also able to see the strategies of the other players based on the choices they were making.  I like this as a fairly flexible, mid-weight worker placement game, and would gladly play again.

Have played with 2 and 4 players, each was fun in different ways.  2 player was a tight race that required strategy, while 4 player had more chaos and required different tactics/strategies to be competitive (as more raids are done by people other than you).

I wouldn't need to own it, as my family isn't yet too interested in worker placement.


Cons: There's basically no theme, you're gathering cubes and trading them for things.

There's a few turns right away where you don't really feel like anything you do is meaningful (pure prep work).

It is absolutely horrible at 5 players (with expansion), as the board state changes so much between your turns that there isn't much point in planning ahead (increasing downtime and randomness).

Um WP leve e que chega quase a ser descontraído. Nada de profundidade aqui, mas extremamente gostoso de jogar. Ótima pedida para novatos e boa pedida para jogadores experientes pelo tema.

RATING: 8.5
First, the negatives:
-a pasted-on theme; but they used a very, very high-quality glue! And the metal coins are remarkably true to the Viking Age!
-the card art is extremely cartoonish, almost to the point of being annoying; but the rest of the art is very well done!
-the end-game is somewhat dull, but not overly; and the end-game doesn't last very long

Apart from that, this is a surprisingly great game! A very good (and I think unique?) worker-placement mechanic, where one places a worker (i.e., slave) and then removes a worker, and this is where the game's player-interaction occurs. Engine-building made simple: just add vikings to your crew, and their special abilities kick in whenever you raid...and sometimes even when you're not raiding. Just a hint of randomness with the card drawing.

This is an excellent introductory worker placement game. There's depth behind the simplicity, and interesting flow to the rotation of pursuing your strategy while tactically responding to your opponents.

This is a reasonably interesting worker placement game that felt a little bit scripted at times on my first play.  Assuredly, the script is altered by cards with asymmetrical effects that you hire, as well as dice rolls, but then again, did these improve the gaming experience?  I am not sure.  Certainly, if you are a fan of card combos and card effects.  

Gather things, make raids in the right locations, in the right order, and that, it seems is how to win.  It felt a bit rinse and repeat, rinse and repeat.  The variable worker color mechanic produced some moderately interesting decisions.  I found the death mechanic to be thematic, but not particularly fun to play with!  Kill my cards that I paid for?  No thanks.  But you can earn victory points!  Still, no thanks.

I was not impressed with this one. There is absolutely no tension in the worker placement part of the game and there is a lot of randomness from the card draws. The game arc doesn’t feel polished as the game can come to a standstill, because no one has enough gold to raid the last fortresses.

Very good worker placement, with an interesting place and pull double action system, and lots of tricky decisions. A lot of folks will compare this one to Champions of Midgard, and justly so, but I feel that this one is the more compelling worker placement mechanically, whereas CoM is a more fantasy-driven take with the spells, monsters, etc. I love both and will keep them both in my collection!

RATING: 7
Fairly accessible worker placement game with a few neat twists, especially the place and pull mechanism. Raiders plays smoothly. It's complexity is probably a step beyond Lords of Waterdeep (Lords is a bit more straight-forward in its game play). Raiders provides an enjoyable experience that, however, can play too long if players lose focus on moving the game towards the end game conditions. The game is best if players are experienced with its systems and ruthlessly march towards the game ending condition (while being sure to end the game when they believe they have the advantage). 

As the game progresses and the different color workers come into circulation, the analysis slightly changes, due to certain raids needing certain workers. The change in worker circulation provides a subtle, but decent, arc to the game. 

Finally, the base game could get a bit stale after a few plays, since the board barely changes between plays. The two expansions greatly help the longevity of the game. First, the suggested draft opening in the expansions' rule book is a great way to get players into the raiding phase more quickly and I'll probably use it moving forward at every player count. Fields of Fame provides opportunities, both scoring and otherwise, if you stack military power to greater heights. Hall of Heroes adds different ways to score victory points that aren't strictly raiding-related. Both expansions add a bit of time to the game. Hall of Heroes is probably my preferred expansion, but both are good and make the game, in my opinion, a bit better than Lords of Waterdeep. The different paths in Raiders are a bit more interesting and varied than the more simple triumvirate of questing, building and faction card focus of Lords of Waterdeep. Lords is still better as an entry point to worker-placement if you are worried about a player's ability to handle more advanced strategy and game mechanisms.

Worker placement game that does somethings very well.  It plays a lot like lords of Waterdeep but does "raiding" vs "building".  The cards could use some more variety and while a good game, it is no stone age when it comes to worker placement games.

Kickstarter. 

Raiders of the North Sea has some of the highest production quality you can find in a game. Incredible artwork, metal coins, custom meeples, unique resources, linen finish on everything. Bravo. 

The game play is fun as well. It's light to medium Euro-style worker placement with the interesting mechanism of placing a worker, taking an action, and then picking up a worker and taking an action. So you can never really be blocked, but you can have the order in which you do two things affected.

Various ways to try and achieve victory - raid as often as possible, climb the valkyrie track for glory, collect offering tiles. The beginning of the game feels a bit repetitive, as every game your first few turns are always going to be collecting silver, provisions, and hiring a few crew. From there though you can really change things up depending on which crew you draw.

Definitely a game everyone should check out if they like Euros, worker placement, and/or vikings!

Fought over 6 or 7 for my rating,  but went with a 7 for now.  The worker placement part is interesting, but the game feels like it needs more to be something that I would want to keep coming back to.  The end game is a bit weird, as everyone is kind of fighting for the right time to grab a white worker to be able to do one of the final raids.  Felt more frustrating than fun probably, which might be why this felt a bit overrated to me.  Am interested to see if the expansions will fix a few of the issues I have with it.

RATING: 10
Firstly, let me just say I'm not much of a fan of entirely worker placement games, which is what this game is with a minor role from drawn cards.

That said, it is easily one of the best games I own. This is the highest rating I've given a game.  Honestly I'm typically a fan of heavier games (Eclipse, for example, is a favorite) but I think, considering all  factors (design, quality, cost, etc), it's probably the best game I own.

Putting aside the game itself this is one of the few games I would ever call out for spectacular quality. The punch boards are top notch. The game pieces are wood.  The coins are metal.  The box is of the best, if not the best, quality among my games.  The box is small for a game this size, which I friggin' LOVE... no huge box with loads of extra space.  The insert is actually USEFUL.  You get extra bags. I also love the artwork, not at all anime, but cartoonish and very colorful.

Now, game play.  If you are a worker placement fan and you like the Viking theme, just stop reading and go buy this.  If you can find it.  I'll touch on that last.  The worker placement function is unique and losing members of our crew (them dying) can be... are you sitting down... actually useful!  The way the resources are laid out on the board, to the side, and used is near genius.  The limits on how many resources you can hold at once keeps anyone from hogging anything.  There are multiple ways for the game to end.  The mechanics are fairly simple, but do leave you really thinking about your next three or so moves up front.  This game also plays well with only two players (2-4 player game).

So, about actually FINDING a copy of this game. You'll likely have to get it off the designers web page as it's not in distribution as of yet.  And that's in New Zealand.  What's that going to cost you?  For a game of this quality being shipped to lords knows where? $48 US.  That included shipping.  Yeah, that's it.

Only possible issue, if you play with people who have AP (think too much) it could potentially go long.

Kickstarter it came from?  Shipped two months early.  Good design, top notch components, shipped early.  Sorry, were you still sitting down when I said all that?

Go buy it.  Now.  Seriously.  http://garphill.com/

I have been presently surprised by this game. It is lighter than my typical game fare, but the gameplay is silky smooth and the components and art are gorgeous. This is a great game to play with newer gamers as well. It is a race game and there are a few ways the game can end, which adds a nice tension and timing to the end game. I think it is a great worker placement game that keeps things simple, but adds enough interesting tweaks to keep more seasoned gamers involved. Also, two expansions will surely add some depth and variety.

A pretty neat worker placement game. Decent theme. Nice components. Recommended if you like Vikings, worker placement, a little take that action....
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Playtested this throughout development, and it's become my favourite of Shem's titles to-date. The twists away from similar games is that you don't typically gather your resources by placing workers; you raid settlements for it. Although you can still produce through workers it is much less desirable. These are vikings, after all. 

This puts an almost limited quantity of resources in the game, and a premium on blocking opponents by raiding FIRST, even though it might not net you as many points. 

The game flow is very easy, with its simple "place one, pick one" worker mechanic. It sounds simple, but combined with different grades of workers and forcing opponents to change the order of their actions (never truly blocked), it has a considerable amount of depth. 

I won't even get started on the gorgeous art by The Mico.  Wonderful follow-through on the theme from Shipwrights of the North Sea, while offering up an entirely different game to the series.

I played the game 3 times and it was very enjoyable.  This is a solid worker placement game.  There are some good actions to choose from but often you are limited in what you can do based on whether you have a black, white or gray meeple. But even with this restriction there are tough decisions.  I liked the game and it is a welcome addition to my collection.  The art is wicked good too and the components are top notch. My girlfriend loved the metal coins.  The card stock is good and the card board is relatively thick too. It would have been nice if the viking meeples looked more like vikings like what Meeple Source provide but this is a minor complaint.

Raiders did some neat things, especially with the pseudo-worker placement system where you often get two actions per turn: one for placing a meeple, and one for pulling another meeple off the board.

However, I felt like the game got very repetitive as the game went on. Gather some stuff, go on a raid. Gather some stuff, go on a raid. Rather than feeling like a build up toward an overarching achievement or grand goal, it just felt like a cycle of repeating the same things, never really progressing into anything, and scoring a handful of points every time a mini-cycle was completed.

Really great artwork and presentation, and a neat idea with the worker placement-ish mechanism, but the overall game just ended up being OK for me.

Unique Worker placement, place a worker/take a worker is clever. The pasted on theme could have been anything. Game can start to get repetitive but ends before it overstays its welcome.

This seems to be like another next step worker placement game similar to Stone Age. Lighter than I thought it would be although with a unique twist on worker placement of on your turn only placing 1 worker and picking up 1 other worker. Because of this the game moves fast and can lead to some tough decisions about what actions to do since the worker might not be where you want it in the order you want it since you must place first. You slowly build up your viking crew to take on progressively harder raids which involve a resource payment, skill check, and dice roll to determine how successful you are. Beyond that there are not many decisions and I also didn't like the random take that of being able to pick on a specific person depending on the cards you play.

Quite interesting worker placement. The main innovation is the 1-2 cadence (drop a worker, pick one) to do 2 actions, which works quite nice, combined with the different color of the workers having significance as to what actions you can take. Seems well balanced too. Nice, solid production, great table space and shelf footprint. Careful though, there are lots of take-that cards, so not all groups will like it. Recommended.

RATING: 9
A great game that has many routes to victory. Most of it is strategy-based, but the set-up has a bit of randomness and each turn is unpredictable because what your opponents do on their turn can dramatically affect what you can/choose to do on yours!  My casual-approaching-medium-core-gamer!sister, super-point-counting-efficient-turns!brother-in-law, and YOLO-awesomeness-fun!I all thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and ended the game with 59, 58, and 58 (tied!) points respectively. 

I love games that require thoughtful play but still have enough bits of randomness/tactics to equalize the playing field between players of different skill levels.  Great game design, and the components are top-notch quality (those metal coins!) and really cute (viking meeples!).

I really like worker placement games and this one adds confrontation between the players if they want to, so i like it even more. It will please those who like  competitive games and those who don't. You can attack the other players and raid like a bloodthirsty viking or you can just raid a bit and simply accomplish quests to get victory points from your jarl and there is no clear advantages for any style of play. the game is beautiful, the rules are simple, it's not too long, there is a lot of variety and each game is different. Come on go and get it!
A big advantage for me is that my 7 years old and my wife love it too!

Not sure why I'm not more enthused about this one - it's a very clever take on worker placement, and I played 2p so the take-that cards weren't a problem. It did feel a little like I had to spend most of my time just gathering money/supplies to only occasionally do cool things; perhaps that was it.

Raiding the name of the game. All strategies focus on raiding. Like the worker placement twist--you can't really be locked out of taking the action you want but you might not get to do it WHEN you want to. Plays quickly and is easy to teach. Beautiful graphic design. It's also nice that game basically packs itself up by the time you're done!

Cons: I can see how this could get samey after awhile. Kinda wish there were more variety in the crew cards.

Fun theme for a Euro game. I like the art style, it's cartoonish in a fun and appropriate feeling way. Board is beautiful. (I'm jealous of some of these Viking beards.) The components are solid quality, cards have nice vinyl finish. (It has serious metal coins and custom meeples despite one of the resources being cardboard punch-outs which is an odd juxtaposition.)
Bit of randomness with drawing from the crew deck, which perhaps contributed to my win. But given the large gaps in score, I think it was more choice of strategy paths than randomness?

Worker placement. Players place a worker and take a worker, each round taking two actions in the viking village OR raid a harbour, outpost, monastery or fortress to earn victory points and/or take loot (cattle, iron, gold). In order to raid you have to gather a crew by drawing cards. These cards can be used in 2 ways: place the character in your longship and use its strength and special power OR play the card to take a one shot action. The strength of your crew can be augmented by means of armour (as you progress on the armour track you also gain victory points). Some raids lead to the glorious death of some of your crew. As the vikings went straight to Walhalla in such a case (doesn't that ring a contemporary bell?) this also leads to progress on the Walhalla track, and...victory points. Extra points can be bought in the viking village by means of combinations of iron, gold, cattle and money.

[16 Jan 2018] - 7.5 (6 plays)
It's a worker placement game with some unique twists. First, every player gets two actions - one when they place a worker and then they pull a worker back from a different space and take the action. This means you need to really feel out the tempo of others and pace off what's available. Second, your crew (the engine) keep getting killed off. This means you have to pause every so often to gather basic materials before heading out to pillage again. Just like racing, timing those refreshes/pit stops it huge. The rules are fairly simple to explain to others and the art work is wonderful to look at. My only complaint right now is that it's a tad too long for the game play. I'm never sad to see the game come to an end. I'm hoping the expansions add enough other concerns to make the additional time worthwhile.

Enjoyed this, despite coming last. Like the mechanism of one-worker-on, one-worker-off. I think I wasted too many turns in the armoury building up strength, since the game finished before I'd had a chance to use it. (Had forgotten that one of the end conditions was last black plunder taken.)

Won second game, by buying quite a few tributes.

Cool theme (Vikings!), with a unique (to me) take on worker placement. You only get 1 worker at a time.  You place a worker/ take the action.  Then, you remove a worker from a different location and take that action.  That's your turn. You can also start raiding to get commodities, and more versatile workers.  I'd really like to play this one again.  The one glaring problem is the "diminishing returns" effect.  As the games draws closer to the end, there are fewer and fewer raiding opportunities, so less things to do with your turn.  Which means that, if you're behind near the end, the likelihood of catching up starts decreasing dramatically.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The most interesting part of the game to me is how the different Meeples interact with the game arc.  Otherwise, it's a fine Euro with tried and true worker placement mechanics mixed with a little bit of die rolling to simulate the risk of battle. I prefer more streamlined games at this point in my life (with small kids and a growing company to manage) or something that is more evocative of theme.

2016-10-03 : Very nice action selection game where all actions aren't available all the time. This makes it at the same time very thinky (good) but it also means that planning ahead is difficult as the board will change a lot before it's your turn again (bad). So treat the 70 minutes playing time with a truckload of salt - it's more like 2 hours. Therefore I wouldn't play this again with 4, but the game was tight, there were multiple strategic paths to victory and the best player won, so I'm absolutely willing to give this another go with 2 or 3, especially since during and after the game I was kicking myself for playing sub-optimally a couple of times - always a good sign.

RATING: 3
Raiders failed to deliver on its Kenner- nomination. The game is incredibly narrow, and players all seem to do the same things, which makes the game feel like its on rails. Gather money, plunder, and provisions, then hire warriors, and finally pillage, rinse and repeat. Since every player is performing these exact tasks to achieve exactly the same goals, the game fails to create stakes. Each action reaps the same reward for all players for the entirety of the game so the game gets stuck in the rising actions and fails to reach any sort of climax. The place and pick up nature of the workers is interesting on paper, but Raiders fails to implement it in an intriguing way.

As soon as I saw there was a standard (TTR) box size I jumped on the kickstarter. Had emailed the designer early on about size and am super glad about this new box.  KS 3.8.17.

Great art & nice components!  There's something fun about *raiding* for resources.  We liked it a *lot* -- hope there is depth for replays as right now I think I'd use the same strategy each time (despite having slightly different crew members, raid opportunities, etc.).  This is one that, owing to scale, may actually play better with two (though it was fun with 3) to create room for different actions.  [PS Credit to the publisher for making it available through the mail from NZ at a reasonable cost.]

I really, really like the IMO innovative worker placement mechanism (I haven't seen it before at least).  It means blocking, which is always irritating, is substantially mitigated.  You generally cannot get blocked out of an action space, at most you may have to execute your two actions in a suboptimal order.  There is some "take that" in the cards but it's situational and didn't come up very often.

2017-09-12: I won 1 measly point ahead of the others!

Worker placement with a neat 'get another kind of worker when placing your worker'-mechanic but nothing revolutionary. Reminding a little, little bit of The Manhattan Project but not a lot.
Highly passively interactive where 'your' spots are always stolen by some other guy.

We all ended within 5 points of eachother which was really surprising!

And also surprising: Such a 'big' game in such a small box. Well done on saving shelfspace there!

Munkáslehelyezés némi csavarral, és kártyákkal megbolondítva. Tetszik a munkáslerakás/felvétel kombináció, mert így szinte mindig bármit megtehetsz, csak a sorrendje kötött a dolognak, illetve az, hogy mit mivel tudsz egy körben végrehajtani.
Jól hozza a vikinges hangulatot a foglalgatás nomeg a valhalla trekk. A grafikák nagyon szépek, különösen a kártyákon. Játékidő, nehézség kellemes.
Két negatívum is volt: a kocka a harcban nekem erőltetett. Egyrészt játékidegen, másrészt pont annyit számít, amennyi eldönthet egy-egy partyt. Illetve a kártyák között azért elég nagy különbség van hasznosságban az játék egyes szakaszaiban. Ez lehet, hogy nem akkora baj, mert azért lehet pörgetni őket, de az elején jókat kapni nagy előnyt jelenthet.

Interesting twist on worker placement games, yet ultimately a rather standard resource conversion exercise. It works, the tempo feels right most of the time, yet too many turns seem to be spent just gathering resources in order to finally go raiding. At that point, small swings of fortune can result in rather large VP spreads.

In theory I like the new worker placement for taking actions. Place a worker on an empty spot to take that action, then remove a worker from a spot and take that action. 
But you only have one worker of a colour and there can only be one worker on a spot. And spots have colour requirements that make spots worse or impossible to use with a worker of some colours. 

So when it is your turn you first take one of the non occupied spaces about 5 in total. Then one of the occupied 3 spaces. Often you cannot do what you want, or you can do one action that you want but the other is usually not something you need. 

And you can be quite restricted and wait for food for a lot of turns until you can use it once to do a raid. Doing rades give VP but always cost hard to get food, and give things that mostly can be traded for VP. 

Getting a few VP now or possibly more later is another mechanism here that I am not a big fan of. You can try to set something up but if there are no worker of the right colour available someone else may do the raid before you and you are left with things you cannot use. And the last raids give so many points taking them before someone else ususally wins the game. 

Also it does not feel like you can create a good engine. You recruit vikings but they mostly give attack points that are needed to get VP on raides. Few give bonuses for doing actions and very few combinations or engines with any real meaning can be made. 

It was quite easy to get into but quite uninteresting to play. Meh in summary. IMHO.

RATING: 6
This game has some very cool things going on, but ultimately I didn't like it so much. It has no engine-building aspect - all of your assets are your crew, who can die or be killed if they look like being useful at all. There are no multiple paths to victory - you've got to go raiding to get anything resembling VPs. The game bogs down towards the end as raids become progressively harder, and as the rewards become bigger small fluctuations in fortune can cause large variations in VPs.

The system of location / worker selection is a brilliant mechanism, I just wish the rest of the game was better.

Streamlined, fast and easy to learn worker placement, yet at the same time complex and engaging. There are multiple ways to score and the idea of having three different kinds of workers works very well (fortresses can only be attacked with white meeples). The art is really inspired. I'm looking forward to playing with the two expansions.

Edit: played with Fields of Fame expansion and enjoyed it more. Now the Valkyries have a more obvious purpose (kill your own crew to get rid of wounds) and the townsfolk cards (and their abilities) are much more valuable. This is a truly outstanding expansion.

Better, and heavier than I thought it would be going in. This game offers interesting mechanics, a cool theme, and tough decisions. My only gripe is that this game is a bit too tactical for my liking. Some times you can't do anything interesting for a couple turns depending on which color meeple the player in front of you left for you or the spots where they left those meeples. I think picking a strategy pretty early in the game and sticking with it through thick and thin is vital. I definitely want to play this again. It is also different enough from Champions of Midgard to justify owning both.

RATING: 5
Worker placement with a twist that plays more like a German-style euro with an action selection feel. Collect resources to build up a tableau of warriors that each give an ability, then use those warriors to "raid" camps and collect resources to gain more warriors. Reach higher and higher up the board as the game continues. The pacing feels a bit off for a race game. If you lose control of your engine, the game slows and seems to continue longer than it feels it should.  Players must stay very disciplined and attentive here. Otherwise, its a nice efficiency game with quality components.

RATING: 6
The variation on the worker placement mechanic is mildly original, but the restrictions that it causes feel random and more annoying than interesting. One thing that bothers me is that number of victory points from raids ultimately depends on the dice, so that a tight game may be decided by luck. Also, there are a few unecessary and unthematic take-that elements (why does a certain viking dying in battle cause the death of another who didn't even take part in the raid?). Otherwise, the game is a reasonably strategic race to get the best raids, even if in the end it's basically another resource conversion affair. The production features nice shaped wooden pieces and metal coins, but lackluster cartoony art.

Fine game with a somewhat unique worker placement mechanic. The cards are a nice addition, even though I don't like the "take that" ones much.

Everything in this game feels pretty scarce and the game runs faster than one might think at first. I guess this can be extremely cutthroat if all players know the game very well.

All in all there's nothing I really dislike, but it's still nothing great in my book. Solid game, though.

Original worker placement mechanic : place one, take one.  Turns are fast.  Any card can be discarded for a one-time effect, however, the effects on some cards are strictly better than the effects on other cards.  Drawing cards allowing bonus actions is almost essential to avoid falling behind.  Dislike the "take that" element on some cards,

A worker placement with a single worker.  You get two actions first by putting your worker on an empty space (of the correct colour) and doing the associated action and second by picking up a different worker and doing the associated action.  This put and take idea expands on an mechanic in Flee the Scene.

Интересный worker-placement.

Gorthauers (Tesera):
Ну там вроде второй тираж вышел осенью, должна была появиться на полках. Плюс скоро будет Кикстартер на базу + 2 допа.
В плане способности конкурировать c Agricola и Puerto Rico: нет, точно нет. Игра другой весовой категории (примерно уровня Замков Людвига), да и играется в районе часа.
В плане реиграбельности: персонажей пока не очень много, в допах обещают добавить, так что пока основное различие между партиями - в рандомном раскидывании лута по местам рейдов.

I played this one twice. The first time, it was fun enough. The second time, I was physically unable to get the correct color workers for half the game, leaving me to drudge through inefficient or completely useless actions. So I'd say the game has severe design flaws, especially at higher player counts, and it's an insult that it got nominated for an SdJ.

Solid lighter worker placement. It's a pretty simple, breezy game, and there is some minimal take-that cardplay, but the place your worker and take another mechanic is pretty clever and kept my interest well enough. Sometimes you need a particular color worker and so you have to take a suboptimal action, and other times you need a certain action and so you end up with a worker that can't go on the raid you want. It's an interesting dynamic. And the way that raids upgrade workers and give the game a natural progression is really nice. Otherwise a pretty standard family/gateway worker placement, but there are enough interesting twists to elevate this above your standard light worker placement.

After several plays Raiders still feels fresh. The place a worker/take a worker mechanism is pretty cool. The art work is great- the vikings on the cards and the landscape on the board bring the fun theme to life. Production value, generally, is top-tier (e.g. metal coins). Rules are surprisingly easy to explain and grasp, particularly for a game that justifiably earned a Kennerspiel nomination.

Another enjoyable worker placement game though nothing outstanding and I'm not the biggest fan of the genre. There's a random factor with dice being rolled to check whether a viking raid is successful. Another specific feature is that a turn usually consists of placing one dice on an empty spot to do an action and then taking another dice from one spot to take this action. Different colors of dice give different strengths to the actions. The first New Zealandish boardgame I've played.

I love the "put one pull one" mechanism, but the actions these allow you to do are... boring. Also, you spend most of the game gearing up for the "exciting" turns, which probably take about 10% of game time. Certain situations also come up where you have no good options to no fault of your own, which reeks of lack of playtesting/development.

This game is a weird kind of worker placement, because you can't actually block spaces from the other players.
But that is some of what i really like about it, because that makes it less lucky to be the first player. You can play any strategy you want and still be able to win, unlike in games like caverna where someone can block your strategy early on and you have to wait until next time to try out that last one you have never gotten yet

1 partida.

Somos vikingos y queremos saquear. Para conseguir los saqueos nos exigirán un número mínimo de vikingos en el barco, unas determinadas provisiones o monedas y un concreto color de meeple.

En el turno de un jugador puede, o saquear o hacer algo en el poblado. En nuestro poblado podemos hacer distintas acciones para aprovisionarnos; primero elegiremos una acción done no haya previamente ningún meeple y luego quitaremos uno de los que están colocados y haremos también su acción correspondiente.

Al principio de la partida iba un poco perdido y luego ya vas viendo lo que necesitas. Al final realmente no sabíamos quien iba a ganar. Bastante entretenido para ser un euro.

Nice twist on the worker placement mechanic. You place your worker during your turn, the workers have different colors and do different things based on this. Then you pick up another worker already on the board and activate that spot as well (for a total of 2 actions).  Then when you have enough resources you get to do a "Raid" to gather plunder and more resources. The game takes about an hour to play and has a nice amount of variation to want to play again and again. Easy to teach, only a few pages of rules.

Very enjoyable and I liked the mechanism of doing two actions, one for placing a worker and one for taking back a worker. Also liked how the cards worked, either enhancing your crew or to be used as special abilities. Also liked having to factor in which crew die on missions stopping one player with a strong crew gaining an easy victory. Colourful board and surprisingly quick play time even with 4 players.

Feels very well balanced when 4 players finished within 4 points of each other despite different strategies and different crew cards.

Raiders of the North Sea is set in the central years of the Viking Age. As Viking warriors, players seek to impress the Chieftain by raiding unsuspecting settlements. Players will need to assemble a crew, collect provisions and journey north to plunder gold, iron and livestock. There is glory to be found in battle, even at the hands of the Valkyrie. So gather your warriors, it’s raiding season!

It's a decent game and the competition for the right workers, the best resource collection spots and the raiding targets generates real tension. The crew cards are a nice addition, although the comic-style artwork doesn't look right. 
I would rate it higher but the worker placement mechanic just doesn't fit the theme, either at the resource gathering end or the raiding end. Apart from the neat Valkyrie pieces it doesn't feel like you're pillaging, it's more like you're going on a two-week holiday to Britain and collecting Scarborough rock and those snowstorm in a globe thingies rather plundering gold and iron.
Still, I can probably have my arm twisted to play. After all, there are some decent beaches on the east coast and Whitby fish and chips are legendary.

Ein Arbeiter Einsetz bzw. Wegnehm Spiel im Wikinger Universum!
Ein sehr schönes Spiel, bei dem man seinen Arbeiter aufs Brett setzt, dort etwas bekommt und dann einen anderen vom Brett nimmt und ebenfalls etwas tut. Sobald man genug Sachen gesammelt hat geht man auf Karperfahrt und erhält noch mehr Dinge und höherwertige Arbeiter, die einmal auf dem Brett gesetzt auch den Mitspielern zur Verfügung stehen *gnarf*!
Im laufe des Spiels werden Siegpunkte gesammelt und am Ende abgerechnet. Fertig.
Mir hat das Spiel sehr gut gefallen, aber ich fürchte ein solches würde bei uns vielleicht noch 2-mal auf den Tisch kommen und dann versacken, leider!
Es ist gut und ich spiele es jederzeit mit, aber dass ich es mir jetzt kaufen muss (wie mein Gefühl vor dem Spielen war), das ist vorbei. Ein sehr schönes Spiel mit verschiedenen Wegen an SP zu kommen. Leider nur für 4 Spieler.

The best thing about this game is that you always have choices that are a perfect balance of not too hard, not too easy. Great light strategy game. My wife kept saying "it's just fun!"

It really puts a couple of twists on the worker placement genre. I liked the different workers, and that every turn you can either do normalish worker placement stuff OR you can go on a raid. I loved the feel of putting together a crew and of getting loot. I liked the armor and the Valkyrie tracks, although I was miffed that tha v track caps out. But all those things made this game VERY THEMATIC. And it does all this rather succinctly with 2 hrs or less of gameplay. I'm impressed.

Art is beautiful and a perfect balance of iconic and yet soft. Outstanding.

Component quality is great. The coins are actual metal.

I've found that this is one game with 2-4 player support that actually plays really well with 2 players.  I really have enjoyed it.

Because you only do 2 actions per turn, you really don't fill overwhelmed with options and details.  And yet, what 2 things you want to do varies from turn to turn based on several factors.  It's not that hard to piece together a workflow though.  

Speaking of which, the first few rounds are a bit predictable, almost scripted.  Before you can do any raiding you need at least 2 crew and at least 2 provisions.  So you need to draw, get silver, hire, and get provisions.  That's how it always starts.  But that's a quibble.

Part of me wants to have expansions for this game just because I love it so much, I want more.  But it doesn't NEED any expansions; it's very concise the way it is.

The wooden items looks a bit strange or weird, that means, cattle, gold, iron and Valkyries.
Maybe the setup would be a bit longer with nice shaped wooden items.
It is a straightforward game.
That means, place and get a meeple, then take the resources and convert it to points.

The fresh twist on workerplacement works fine. I played it 5 times now - do not play with only two. My biggest concern is the lack of variety and the therefore the weak replayability.

lighter than lewis and clark but same feeling in gameplay.

great art great component quality. any better and picking out during random setup wouldn't work.
mechanics are simple and enjoyable while being complex enough for players to be engaged 
The differnt workers work well but I don't get the theme connection, seems to be the only disconnect.  Not a big thing but just a nit pick I noticed.

happy to see how enjoyable it was with 2 players.  Some worker placement games just are not fun with 2.
overall game might not change much with variable set up but the drop and pick up worker placement seems to make it work well.

-Interesting Viking Crew
-Innovative  worker placement double action mechanic
-Easy to teach but strategic to play

Cons:
-Some "take that" elements

Pros:

+Easy to learn
+Interesting central mechanic--place one worker, remove one worker
+Beautiful art on board and cards
+Quality production 
+Small footprint
+PLAYS WELL WITH 2!!!

Cons:
-Not my favorite viking game. For my collection, I'd say something like Vikings > Fire and Axe > Blood Rage > Yggdrasil > Raiders of the North Sea. 
-Although the central mechanism is different and fun, the game doesn't feel that original. 
-Setup is a bit fiddly 
-No "wow" factor
-Theme is rather pasted on

Overall: A welcome addition to my collection. It's at a disadvantage being both a worker placement game and a viking game in a crowded field. But with the small footprint and great production, it will maintain a spot in my collect for the time being.

KS backer, the game was promised for december 2015, and was delivered to Colombia (South America) on October 28th 2015, almost 2 months earlier than promised.  The game is colorful, the production quality is outstanding, and it's very fun and quick.  Plays a bit like a faster and less AP-prone cousin to Village, with some variable powers and just a bit of take-that introduced by the crew cards.  We liked it a lot.

It's just worker placement with only a slight mechanical variation from what we have seen before. Nothing to rave about.

Just another friendly WP game and I am not a great fan of that genre.

Beautiful components, really unique worker placement mechanic where you place a worker on an available space to take an action, then must take one that is already on a space somewhere else on the board and take that action as well. Mixed in with this are three worker types, representing how they gain experience as the game goes on. There is take that in the card play (sacrificing a card from your hand to do something to your opponent, or gain other items). 

You build up your crew and provisions, then raid harbors, monasteries, and keeps in an almost race like fashion - each of these raid areas getting progressively harder, but providing more rewards. Multiple ways to score points, but the heart and driver of the game are the raids. On top of that, some raids allow you to roll dice to add to your chances of scoring victory points in a raid.

Love this game. Takes worker placement to a whole new level.

this is a very very cool game!

It's simple, each turn you place a viking on one location of the board and perform it's action and then you take one other viking of the board and do the action of the place he was in. Very simple!

You start the game gathering supplies and forming your crew to get on the boat and cross the North see to go Plundering and Conquering new lands and it's riches, so you stick to doing action on your village, then you go and Raid... and prepare for the next raid and so on!

This is another game that's accessible to new comers, it's also beautiful! The Board is very well laid out and the artwork on the cards is stunning... amazing jog on the art aspect of the game!

I have had a couple of plays of a fairly advanced prototype set of Raiders of the North Sea and must say that I quite like it. The game plays well and offers some pretty interesting choices to be made. The theme of raiding work really well and. As with all good euros, there are multiple paths to victory.

There are a lot of well thought out gaming mechanisms in the game which greatly augment both play balance and replayability. For example, way that the Valkyries work (i.e. they kill a raider but there are victory points to be had for glorious death in battle) is another nice touch to a game that is simple to learn but has a fair bit of depth. 

Interestingly, the KickStarter campaign went really well and hit all the initial stretch goals so other ones had to be added. These new goals (PnP boards & digital wallpaper) were a bit ordinary which, to me suggest the game is pretty much the finished product and needs neither additional variables nor chrome.

Like Victor Kiam and the Remington shaver, I liked Raiders of the North Sea so much I backed the game. The KickStarter campaign has now finished and I await fulfilment. If it’s anything like the prototype (and I'm betting it will be) the finished product should be a winner.

Excellent worker placement game. This is what Champions of Midgard should have been. The place a worker, take a worker mechanism works really well, and raiding different spots on the board really helps reinforce the theme. At the end of the day though, this is most definitely a cube-pusher. There's some dice and crew cards to add some pzazz, but otherwise this is a somewhat overpriced worker placement that is less dry than most other cube pushers.

UPDATE: Definitely best with less players. This would probably be a 5 with the full player count. Nothing is really added except downtime with more people.

RATING: 5
A hybrid of worker placement and card combination. Place workers to collect resources and cards then use the resources and the cards to raid. However, it feels like this hybrid is neither one thing nor the other. 

The random cards make long term planning hard and you're often forced to play tactically from the given cards. Since the raids cost both resources and cards you never build any engine and there is no sense of progress. Instead, you have to "start over" for the next raid. This is particularly the case towards the end of the game, when you may have to visit the same places several times to collect enough for the last raids (with increased risk of someone else accidentally getting before you). 

Raiders of the North Sea may be a good introduction to worker placement for card fans and vice versa but there are better games within each of the different categories.

RATING: 8.5
Great worker-placement game with an interesting "place one, take one" mechanic for the workers. On each turn you either do two actions in the village to gain some benefit, or you go on a raid to gain victory points and loot. You always start each turn with one worker in hand; if you go to the village, you place the worker in a building to take its action, then pick up a worker from another building to take a second action. On a raid, you place a worker to do the raid, then pick up another worker as part of the loot. The trick is that there are three different kinds of workers, and the more advanced ones are only awarded as raid loot (and are required to do harder raids), so they don't enter into circulation until later. Pretty easy to learn but with a good deal of interesting strategic choices and lots of ways to get points.

Solid worker placement game with a little bit of tableau-building.  The "take that" cards tend to be rather mild, but I really dislike the fact that you can be hit with them (via the Town Hall) as soon as the game starts, before you've had a chance to do anything.

Enjoyed the game, liked the mechanism of placing and removing a worker to do your two actions.

Felt the game was a little limited as you had to hope that the player before you did what you wanted them to do so you could do an optimal move for you. For certain actions you needed to do things in a certain order (get money to hire new crew) and if those actions were blocked, you didnt get to do what you needed this turn.

Raiding was pretty much a foregone conclusion as long as you could afford the pre-requisite cost.

Generally no tension and a fairly pedestrian game, nothing spectacular

Was a bit let down with this one. Looked great, but felt ... kinda bland. The theme of raiding vikings is totally lost - this feels nothing like war and there isn't much excitement involved. Fairly standard worker placement and first-come-first-serve goals on the board to work up to, yet there is very little blocking and not much you can do to get in each others' way. Even the "take that" card powers are weak at best. There is some interesting stuff: double-action workers by placing one and taking one (but again, the coloured workers don't have as much effect as it first seems), and losing warriors to Valkyries in many of the raids ... I just felt all of the mechanics were done weakly. Will play again though.

Worker-placement waarbij je in je beurt de keuze hebt om te roven of je viking te werk te stellen. Bij het te werk stellen kan je dan 2 acties doen ... bij inzetten een actie en bij het terugnemen van een andere werkende viking mag je ook die actie doen. Super cool gevonden.
Ook zit er een zeker pest-gehalte in, wat de interactie op peil houdt.

Raiders is the second in the North Sea saga series of games. After Shipwrights and its building of boats, you get to use those boats to raid new lands! The game is fun, includes some balanced mechanics, and leaves you with a feeling you could have won if only for one or two moves. 

The game does suffer from a multiplication effect in the final tally (no spoiler; find it for yourself), but what bothers me more is the complete state of unknown around who has won. Basically, at the end, you count all these points and wind up at 57 to 58 and wonder if you counted right or if it was total luck in the cards and which outposts the first person raided. I suppose this could be seen as part of the charm in trying to trick others into thinking you have more points, but it comes off as not as properly contrived. 

I have heard the expansion greatly adds to the game.

It's not the best game, but for the price I would recommend it, I would buy it again. Great quality, there is what to think about. What I don't like a little is that sometimes you'd better do what you pponents, especially when killing valkyrie. Sometimes after ending the play I feel like playing once again

Wonderful art and metal coins. Interesting take on worker placement.
BUT... there's something off with the rhythm of the game. Players were very unsatisfied with what they can achieve within a turn, it felt like a race with untied shoes.

Raiders of the North Sea is a fast-flowing worker placement game in which every time you place a worker, you take a worker off another spot and execute the actions of both places. There are also three different colors of workers, the more advanced of which come from conquering various settlements on the map. However, you can get also get these advanced workers by picking them up as others play them. Once these settlements are conquered, those spaces are no longer available, which acts as kind of a game timer. There are also cards that give players special abilities, and whose strength values are needed to conquer the various settlements. On the whole, I liked this game--it was pretty light, but it was very easy to learn and I really liked the flow of putting down and picking up workers--no rounds necessary.

This is an excellent introductory worker placement game by designer Shem Phillips. A thematic follow-up to Shipwrights of the North Sea, this continues the saga of your band of vikings. Having built the ships for your invasion force in Shipwrights, you now have to send your intrepid vikings out a raidin'. As your raiders gain experience, they can raid increasingly more valuable settlements and bring home more and more prestige (victory points). The plunder collected provides needed resources to outfit your next invasion, but can also be used to appease the chieftain by providing him with generous "donations".

The gameplay is a fast playing, novel take on the worker placement genre. Each player gets one or two actions per turn. They can send their worker to the village to prepare for the next invasion or they can send their representative out on a raid. When working in the village, two actions are taken, the first when the worker is placed and the second when a different worker is returned. This makes for an interesting push and pull of available worker placement sites with available locations changing constantly. Another interesting aspect is that the workers needed for specific actions in town and different difficulties of locations to raid is not fixed. Initially you have black workers that have access to most locations in town, but can only raid the weakest settlements. Once you send them out on a raid, however, they get "bloodied" and become a more experienced raider. This additional experience opens new locations in town, but provides a lower return at other locations. After all, that worker's experienced now and has better things to do that running errands for you! There are three tiers of workers, which I think of as "green horns", "experienced", and "veterans." Thematically, I think this is brilliant!

Overall, this provides for a tight, thematic worker placement game that is quick playing and just a ton of fun. The production quality is immaculate (the hefty metal coins are so incredibly satisfying to use) and the artwork is beautiful thanks to The Miko. This would be the perfect game to keep on the shelf and break out as an introduction to the worker placement genre.

Didn't know much about this one. A friend wanted to play it so I agreed. It was actually a nice resource collection to turn into points game. There is the working phase to build up your stash of Vikings and provisions. But you are gearing up to go on the raids to get better opportunities for better raids. It all leads up until you had the strength and crew to go on the best quests for the most points. What I like about the game is that you get 2 action when  you are "working" you place your meeple for and action then you remove a different meeple in the same working area for the second action. You always end your turn with a meeple- might be a different color depending. Very cool idea. I enjoyed this game a lot and would definitely play again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Beautiful. Makes it to the table often. The endgame is a bit monotonous. The place and pull mechanic is a lot of fun, as is the killing of crew for points. It's great for a light-mid weight worker placement, and the theme will attract any new gamer. The setup is easy, but there are a lot of meeple to place and it does take a while. All in all, a keeper.

This is a worker placement game that has the best beards in a board game that I've ever seen. The gameplay is quite light, but it has a clever core worker placement mechanism. In this game,workers don't belong to the players. Rather, on your turn you place a generic worker and resolve the action, and then pull a different generic worker and resolve the action it was left on by someone else. Through this method, actions become available or unavailable in a semi-unpredictable manner that makes things pretty interesting. The game also has dual use cards, where the card as a play effect that can be strong, or you can add it to your tableau where it can be used on resource/point collection raids, which you have to do to ever win any points. 

There's nothing about this game that's completely mind blowing, but it's very smooth and fun with very little downtime between turns. There are a few different paths to victory depending on what cards you get and how hard you choose to lean into them for your strategy. After 3 plays I sort of felt like I had seen what this game has to offer, and while I still like it, I don't know that I need to keep it.

Interesting worker placement mechanic where you place a worker and you pick a worker to activate 2 action spots.

The place one, take one twist on worker placement was very cool and a neat touch. Unfortunately pretty much everything else was rather bland in my opinion. 

It's not too hard to learn and there is a good flow to the game making it a decent choice for those newer to worker placement games. But I fear that even though there is plenty to consider there really isn't that much depth underneath it all. I could be wrong, but I'm not keen on playing enough to find out. 

The theme is relatively weak and for the most part you're just converting bits into other bits like many modern Euro games. I'm ill convinced there's much player interaction here. In general each turn you'll analyze the board state and make whatever move is best for you. Sure there is a bit of different board states you can leave for your opponent, but in general they can do whatever they need or want to. 

Overall the game is fine. It was fun enough but doesn't have me rushing back for more. I'm a bit confused by the great love some have for it, as I don't see anything to make this exceptional.

This is my favorite worker placement game. The restriction of different color workers limited to various action spaces in combination with the place one worker do the action, pick up a worker do the action makes for some interesting decisions.

Its a real shame this game isn't more widely accessible to everyone. There is some real planning involved with your turns. I like how the "better" workers allow for certain actions, but can actually block you from doing the other "basic" ones. I can't wait for the two new expansions that are on kickstarter. It does seem like the "Hall of Heroes" is going to be the slightly better one over "Fields of Fame".

We picked this up from Kickstarter and have gotten through a few games of it now, so time for a review.

Visually, it is great. The box is perfect size with the components, as well as being sturdy, and the outside art is well done. Inside, the board is great. Nice quality and more great art. The ingame cards are of nice quality and, once again, the artwork is excellent. 

The pieces are very well done as well. The green/brown player colours are different enough not to be an issue for most colour blind players (not that these pieces would cause much of a problem with play). The resource pieces are quite distinctive too. We got the metal coins with the set, which are fantastic (though we only got 31 instead of 32, not a big issue with play limits ingame). 

The game has the basic idea of worker placement and resource gathering. It has a great mechanic of place a worker/take a worker. So you can't really be locked out of a resource tile in the starter village. This is a big plus for me, there's nothing worse than being locked out of the "best" tiles in a game as the last player. There is still a lot of strategy involved, where you can leave a worker on a zone so the next player must do it as his last action - you can also leave a level of worker that he does not want to annoy him too. 

Gameplay is relatively simple once you understand what the icons on the board mean. Essentially, you use your workers to build resources and a crew - then use them to go and raid increasingly difficult targets. You will lose crew, but they die gloriously in battle - which gives you bonus points at the end of the game, though you do get setback a little early. Your crew will all bring various benefits. Crafting crew bring bonuses in resource terms, but have no strength and are less useful when attacking later. Warriors bring plenty of fighting strength, but provide little economic benefits. All in all, their abilities do seem decently balanced.

Crew cards can also be played as an event. This either brings an immediate benefit directly, or can provide a hindrance to one or more opponents. This can provide a useful balancing effect when one player starts to move into a lead.

So far - it's all good. However, there are issues with this game. The main one for me is that, despite the ability to use crew cards to hinder your opponents, there is often little interaction with other players in the game. In a 4 player game, once you have your turn there is very little reason to pay attention until the player preceeding you is taking their turn. You cannot really plan too far in advance, because what you will do often depends on the last action he does in his turn. The game can also suffer from balance issues at the start too. If you get a good initial hand of crew members - you can get an explosive start compared to someone who gets unlucky. So pulling any of the Jewelcrafter (+1 coin from silversmith), Recruiter (-1 cost for crew members) or especially Forager (+1 provision when going to mill) will give a superb early game. Choosing 3 from an initial 5 cards gives some insulation from bad luck. But, from experience, I see that getting early luck with your crew can roll into an easy game. Perhaps some kind of draft for early cards might have been useful? Because of the lack of interaction and the inability to plan far in advance, the game can seem to go on a bit. This is because, as the games goes on, people need a little longer to think out their turn. As they cannot really start thinking until it is literally their turn, a 4 player game can be quite some time between when you need to be involved in the game. 

The little annoyances above aside, this is a fun worker placement game with interesting mechanics. It is one that I'd certainly play from time to time.

I will probably sell this soon. Interesting to play by a very one dimensional worker placement game. Feels repetitive and lacks replayability. In an overcrowded genre this is a poor cousin to so many others. 

Maybe the expansions help but is it really worth spending another €75(min) to find out?

Its an innovative worker placement game, really hampered by its lack of theme. A lot of people seem to see/feel the theme, but I can't seem to figure it out. For me, the theme and mechanics must go hand-in-hand for me to really get into the game, and this really doesn't. How do the vikings know exactly what each fortress has, resource-wise? why are there 3 shades of workers/what do they represent? how is it that when i throw my champion into the town hall, i make all other vikings lose a provision? 

that being said, as a pure mental thought exercise, its pretty good. sits near lords of waterdeep as an entry-level euro

It's very good!  Smooth and attractive, with just a couple cool innovations to worker placement that keep you engaged and provide fun, meaningful decisions.  The features I enjoy the most:

1. Building up a crew of characters (great artwork!) and then sending them to raid monasteries.
2. Each decision you make is fairly quick and not too brain-burny, which makes for a fast-paced game.  After you get a play under your belt, you can definitely finish a game in just over an hour.

RATING: 6
An interesting take on worker placement where players put a worker into action space and takes a worker from action space each turn. This means that there is no concept of rounds where all workers are taken off and the board resets. There is a slight engine building in it where you are building your army to raid outposts and fortresses. The issue I see with the raid is the diminishing returns, so as the game gets closer to the end you have very limited options. If you are behind, it gets increasingly difficult to catch up which is a let down.

Viking harcosokkal töltjük meg fantasztikus vitorlásunk, majd portyázva bejárjuk a környéket és kifosztjuk kikötőket, kolostorokat és erődöket. A játék érdekessége a munkáslehelyezés. Azaz egyetlen munkásunkat felhelyezzük egy akcióra, azt végrehajtjuk, majd leveszünk egy fent levő másik munkást és azt az akciót is végrehajtjuk. A portyázás során szerezhető nyersanyagokat a vezetőinknek felajánlva gyűjthetünk győzelmi pontot az egyes építmények kirablása mellett. Hajónkat maximum 5 harcossal tölthetjük fel, akik össz ereje határozza meg hány győzelmi pontot kapunk egy-egy fosztogatáskor, amibe még némi véletlen is hozzájön plusz kockák használatával. Érdekességek a valkűrök, akik egy-egy támadás során letámadják katonáinkat, de veszteségünk a játék végén győzelmi pontot hozhat. A felvehető katonák között előfordulnak hősök is, akik tulajdonságai lehetnek nagyon erősek, viszont teljesen véletlenszerűen húzzuk a lapokat, így előfordulhat, hogy valakihez egyetlen hős sem jut, más pedig tobzódik bennük és ez eléggé meghatározza a végső értékelésnél elfoglalt helyünket. Ezt a negatív dolgot az kompenzálja, hogy a játék gyors, így lehet még egyet játszani. Elsőre legyen hatos, aztán lehet még jobb is.

An interesting twist on worker placement - put a worker down to take an action on an unoccupied space, then pick up a different worker that has already been placed down prior to your turn.  It took a little time to get used to, as one player continually signalled the end of his turn before picking up, so we would have to rewind.

Nicely balanced for points acquisition, with several luck elements that make for varied gameplay.  However, there is not a huge amount of depth to the game, and I can see needing the expansions to make this interesting after several plays.

WTP 3/4 [WORKER PLACEMENT] 2-4 players; 60-80 minutes; A viking-themed worker placement game of collecting provisions and crew to go on raids with some nasty player interaction
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I was really impressed by this game.  It is quick-playing, easy to understand, and clever.  I'd much rather play it than Stone Age.  You will do two things on your turn, and at least one of them will be the thing you really wanted to do.   That's a simple but genius way to go about worker placement.

I'd rate it higher, but I don't really care for the small amount of 'take that' on the cards, and I think the card balance might be a little lacking.  Otherwise, I was really impressed, and I'd play it again.  It would be a great game to introduce someone to worker placement.

[Garphill Games Kickstarter 15 edition] {Viking; worker-placement; optimal 4p} This is a good game. It allows tactical planning with a strategy.  It needs careful resources management: workers, livestock and provisions.  The game is right but not too daunting.  Player interaction is good too!  this is more like an action drafting game than a worker placement game.

The quality of this game is awesome.  The illustration is clear and vivid with nicely crafted resource meeples.  The iconology is clear to me.  I am glad that I pledged it.

Had one good game and one bad game so far.

It is possible for games to lock up/ slow down in a couple of circumstances. Just not sure how often that it would occur or if there is a counter measure. The issue is (i) if the random set up of resources leads to limited supply of a particular resource in the harbour and (ii) players hoard a resource as they are encouraged to by the Merchant and other cards. 

This could stagnate the offering cards that may all require a resource that is not available. 

More games needed to see how big an issue this becomes.

Solid game with a unique worker placement mechanic. There's a lot of different options and paths you can take, but the lack of actions (even further limited by the mechanic) make it that much better. Definitely some interesting and difficult decisions to make. Really easy to learn teach as well.

tl;dr: been there, done that, but well executed

Worker placement and variable cards to spice things up. Nothing new here. But it does work pretty well and there's some nice tention that Shipwrights was missing.
There is some good planning needed to pull off a victory because if you don't pay attention, you might lock yourself out of things you really want. The WP system where you take a worker from an other location does add a nice dimension to your choices.

Kickstarted this one. Worker placement game with an interesting twist: three types of workers (white, grey, black) which can all choose different actions. And also the mechanic of getting two worker actions a turn by first placing a worker and performing its action and then taking another worker from the board and performing its action makes this game stand out. Played it with two: great experience. Played it with three: also great, but the game ends sooner than expected, and sooner than we wanted because it is a great game with a nice Viking theme. Recommended!

another viking worker placement game with some nice ideas

I like the different types of viking warriors you can have in your crew giving different bonuses.
The worker placement with the twist (place+pickup) is interesting.

I don't like the artworks and graphics style. The card design needs to be improved (e.g. make text more readable)!

+ some interesting ideas (viking types, worker place+pickup, Valhalla skulls and points, cards usable in multiple ways, ...)
- artworks, graphics style, card design
- almost only looting and you can't fail which is odd and unrealistic
- way too expensive for what it is

I found Raiders to be an enjoyable and relatively quick-playing game that implements worker placement and a type of economic snowball effect for quality thematic gains. There is a little too much "take that" in some of the special abilities, and a little too much crowding in the basic worker placement stations, but these seem more like blemishes than outright faults.

On your turn, you place your workers on one of the basic stations at the lower end of the board. You take the action (gaining provisions, viking raiders, etc.), and then you get a second action. For your second, you remove another worker from a station, and again take the corresponding action. So you place and then remove, taking an action each time. Workers stay on the board, but because you get to place and remove, it may seem like you get to take whatever actions you please on your turn. Not so, because workers come in different colors. Placing a worker of a particular color on a space activates different abilities. So if you want the white action, but there's a grey worker on the space, you must remove the grey worker and take the grey action. Thus, it's still possible to clog up the works.

The point of all this worker placement is to eventually gather enough resources to push inland (i.e., further up the board) to better and more valuable point-scoring stations. These stations represent viking raids. The father inland you sail, the more points you earn (in addition to gathering things like gold and different color workers for use back on the basic action spaces).

Finally, your raiders have special abilities. Some last the entire game, or until you lose the raider. Others are one-time shots that vary in power. More valuable raiders are more expensive to acquire, but come with better fighting scores or more powerful special abilities. And some of the abilities are quite potent, allowing you to, for example, steal from the other players (especially nasty when you can tell they are about to launch a raid inland for big points).

Overall, the game felt fun and thematic. While it's really just a snowball of an engine, Raiders manages to avoid feeling dry or rote. I've left out a number of other point-scoring opportunities in my description, but the heart of the game is still gathering resources for more points.

That said, I did feel like the "take that" special abilities felt tacked on. I'd have preferred the mechanic to feature more prominently or not at all. As is, there is a feeling of unfairness to getting hit with a nasty card after spending so much time building up the perfect set of resources for the perfect raid. That's fine in a combat game where fighting is expected, but it almost comes out of nowhere in Raiders.

Likewise, it can be tough to gather resources. Because the stations get so crowded so quickly, it can feel like you're simply suffering from bad luck rather than bad timing when you lose out (yet again!) on the one station you need to complete a set of badly needed resources. Why should Arthur get to use that station but not me? He didn't plan any better. He just happened to be sitting next to Jim when Jim uncovered the space. -- Frustrating.

That final quirk pushes the game down a bit for me, but overall, I'd gladly sit down to another game.

Ths game has an interesting take on worker placement.  Also, I thought that the theme was implemented well.  My only complaint is that resources get tight at the end of the game, so it feels like it slows down at the end rather than speeding up.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Not bad. The best thing is the fast, easy flow of the game. You just place a worker to usually take some resources, then you remove a worker to take some other resources. Then onto the next player. There are no long combos or complicated actions to slow things down.

My only concern is some of the take-that cards. Resources can be tight and sometimes you have your next one or two moves all lined up, but somebody can steal a resource from you that messes up your whole plan. Those attack cards feel out of place in this type of game.

I would have to play more to see how those cards affect the game in the long-term, but this is a fine game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
A solid worker placement game. There is a clear progression as you start to go raiding. There are a ton of different crew members that each add their own little something. The base mechanic of placing a worker and then removing a worker adds a nice bit of interactivity between the players.

Didn't love it the first time I played it. I feel that it gets a bit repetitive in terms of actions in the game. Second time through playing it though was much better; and I have come to enjoy the simplicity of the game. Still wish there was a bit more too it but overall not bad.

I didn't know anything about Raiders of the North Sea but there looked to be a lot of resource management involved, so I was intrigued. The board and cards were pretty as well, which always helps.

In the game you play the role of a viking leader who is planning a series of raids. On your turn you place a worker on a spot, and do the action. Then you pick up a worker from the board, and do that action. The exception is that if you raid, you pick up a worker from a raid spot, but do no further action. Additionally, the workers you pick up come in three colors: black, gray and white. Many action spots are color coded. Most of the actions in the game involve getting money, provisions, gold, iron and cards (which represent crew).

Crew cards can be played to your tableau where they will help you raid, or can be played for an immediate effect. Crew members usually give you a strength and some special ability.

When you raid, you'll need the appropriate number of crew members, provisions and gold depending on the spot. Raiding gives you stuffs (which are randomly assigned to different spots at the beginning of the game), and points if you have enough strength. Sometimes you can get more points if you have a higher strength as well. Strength comes from a combination of your crews strengths (or special powers), your armor, and sometimes a die roll (or two). You'll always get the goods on the spot, even if your strength isn't sufficient to score the points. Some spots will have Valkyries randomly assigned, which force you to kill a crew member, but you get ever increasing victory points for sending warriors to Valhalla.

There's an alternative to raiding, where you can spend resources to claim victory point tiles if you have the appropriate set of goods.

The game ends when all but one spot have been raided, when all the Valkyries have been taken, or when all the victory point tiles have been taken.

The game was interesting. There's definitely a race aspect to the game where everyone is rushing to do the same things. There's some swing to the game as crew card draws are random. You might luck into better cards or at least draw the right card at the right time. There's also a take-that element where you can play crew cards to steal things from other players. Those elements were a little bothersome and were right at the border of how much luck/slapfighting I want in a game of this length. Overall I enjoyed it, but I don't know how often I'd seek it out.

For a near entry level worker placement, I found the gameplay more fast-paced and interesting than most in it's league.  Once people understand all of the facets, turns are lightning quick.  There's never any wall-pounding decisions to make but there are trade-off's.  The constant pressure is there as raid targets are getting snagged up around you.  

Components are top notch, and bonus points for the compact, and jam-packed box.

We played a three handed game of 'Raiders of the North Sea' which is essentially to do with organising a Viking raiding party/fleet in competition with one or more similarly delinquents!
Players start with set income, a ship and the favour of Odin (say that with a mental image of Tony Curtis and you'll catch my drift) and begin to assemble a crew and set their plans.
Each turn, they will place a bondsman (I don't like the term worker here!) into the village where each of the seven or so buildings allows their raiding party to perform certain actions.
These can include visiting the silversmith, to get more funds, recruiting crewmen, securing provisions (the North Sea is rough, after all) and meeting your jarl (clan leader) for favours....
Not those kind of favours, methinks, as this ain't no game of 'Bus Stop'. You then remove a bondsman piece and 'activate' that ability. It cannot be the same one you just placed.
Once a raiding party has sufficient crew, provisions, and in later stages gold, they can then set out to loot the coast, usually starting with the harbours and working further inland.
The requirements to raid are shown against each settlement so it may be easier to raid harbours and outposts, but, the pickings are the monasteries and the fortresses. Bear this in mind!
A successful raid yields a mixture of loot, randomly selected according to pre-determined numbers, and include items like gold, iron, livestock and Valhalla tokens as well.
More on these later. When raiding a settlement, the player takes all of the goodies plus the 'attached' bondsman piece. These are different colours to the original black ones.
This is because players will need to use the grey and white pieces to perform raids to gain the better victory points that are associated with monasteries and fortresses.
Attacking these requires the raiders crewman strength - shown in red at the top right hand of each card - plus any bonuses mentioned and two average dice to exceed its defence.
Higher valued attacking results gain more victory points. These are scored immediately the attacks are concluded, whatever settlement type it may be, so don't forget to do this!
When selecting crewman, these are added to a player's initial hand draw of three, I think, and can only be readied by paying their value, shown on the left hand side of the card.
Each crewman have two abilities. The left hand ones are usually bonuses to raiding applied when the criteria are met. The others are one-time benefits and then the card is discarded.
There is a building in the Viking village allowing crewman purchase and secondary ability activation. These latter ones can be quite useful to obtain abilities required urgently as I found out!
Players also accrue victory points for improving their standing on the prowess track, allowing bonuses to be added in raiding, and the Valhalla track. The latter works as follows.
Within some of the settlements are tokens. shaped like skulls, which when exchanged, mean a crewman dies, so choose wisely, but your clan's valour increases each time.
Some crewman dying gain additional victory point bonuses in the same way that others add to combat or taking settlements. The crewman combat values range from '0' to '4'.
The crewman deck is random, so whilst it is possible to get some higher value ones, the cost of employing them is greater, and longer-term if you choose to 'raid big' later on.
You can also gain victory points by trading loot to retrieve favours from the jarl, measured in victory points, and when the last three of these are placed, the last turn is played by each player.
The game also concludes, with one final turn, when there is but one fortress left unraided, so timing is key if you are to secure ultimate victory in the form of Janet Leigh.
A good game, that with a few plays should be completed within ninety minutes. It was well explained, so no KRO's to report, and one to be recommended to all those hairy wannabe Norsemen.

Wow, did I dislike this game. First off: The core ideas are cool. This could have been a good game. BUT...
1. The start player has an advantage that is not balanced in any way.
2. You all do the same thing until someone can finally go and raid. Then at least the options grow.
3. The characters are imbalanced and luck decides if you draw the good ones. 
4. There are characters where a player can seriously hinder ONE player, 
5. There are no diverging paths. You can't play differently than the others. You all do variations of the same strategy. Also, the game is super linear. I see no replayability on this.
6. The iconography isn't good.
7. The different colour workers are mechanically ok, but themtically...? 
I disliked this game from the first turn.

Silky smooth feel to the turns, with both long term and short term objectives in terms of raiding.  Subtle shifts in tactics as money tightens and fewer black coloured meeples are available.  It's one of those "I shoulda" games ("I should have..." thoughts that pop in your mind minutes or hours later).

RATING: 7
This is an enjoyable, pleasantly thematic resource management game. It's competitive without being particularly mean, so that's a point in its favor. The custom wooden bits are great. Having to juggle not only where to place/pick up workers but also what color worker to use adds a nice layer of strategy and planning. If the game were just a touch shorter in length, I suspect it would get played more often. As it is, the lengthy setup process makes it more likely that something else will get played instead.

Clever advancement of the worker placement with wicked interaction. I love the placement and pull off mechanic of worker actions from a shared group of vikings that become more seasoned further into the game--brilliant. Without a traditional cleanup phase this game creates an uninterrupted race to hire crew and gather provisions for progressively demanding raids. Plenty to consider; build your armor rating, gain recognition from gifts to the chief, lose warriors in the glory of battle, time viking card effects for maximum screwage of the other players, and above all time the usage of the placement and pulloff of your viking meeples. I cannot overstate how much I like the continuous play and pull action. This game kills some of my old worker placement games.

A fine worker placement game with the twist that the workers become a shared pool and the colour of the worker matters. Not sure why they chose black, white and grey as the colours - seemed a bit dull. I found the game to be a bit restrictive, strategies of all players seemed quite similar - one player focussed on building VP chits but lost significantly. The cards were interesting but I think we had a promo card in the deck that came to the winning player and it was unconditionally better than the other "rare" cards in the deck.

A unique twist on worker placement here where you don't own a certain color of dudes, but place one and remove any other one from the board to activate two abilities a turn. This makes a different decision space than other similar resource converters and we were all impressed by the smoothness of the game overall. It did drag a little at the end as none of us had prepared well for the end game.  If that disappears in subsequent plays this will be a strong addition to my middleweight Euro collection.

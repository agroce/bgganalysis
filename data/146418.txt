This is an excellent low-budget alternative to tabletop miniature wargaming.  Obviously you miss out on all the assembling and painting and heavy breathing, but you still get a big army that looks a lot better on the table than *unpainted* miniatures, and critically the gameplay is solid.  The two available expansions are quite generous and expand the "good" and "bad" sides independently.

If you like the idea of tabletop wargaming for the gaming and not the collection aspect, I highly recommend picking this up.  

Oh, and though I love Shut Up & Sit Down, their review of this game is basically useless (they didn't understand several rules).  Tom Vasel's is much more fair.

RATING: 3
1st play: this game ended up being better than I expected. Combat is fast and the army building might be fun. The rules could use some work, plenty of ambiguities, but for a quick scrimmage game it was decent

No 2nd play: Too fiddly and just not enough 2p opportunities. Neat idea though.

Haven't really played this game enough to make a final judgement, but giving some comments and a rating anyway. I really like the warhammer fantasy battle universe and have played it tabletop. So I want to like this game. My first impression was of frustration and dissappointment since the rules are badly written, making one look at FAQ and discussions to interprete rules. Also I dont really like that one can for example make ranged attacks as normal when in close combat. Also pinning is improportionally important, line of sight simplified, one can move over owns units, and other things...things like that is not really "realistic". But after played the game a couple of times, it wasnt such a big deal and seems to work ok. But have to play more to give my final verdict. But since I like to play the game at the moment I give it a 9 for the moment. Will see if this changes after more plays. Have both expansions and they are fun also.

I like how it's basically a mini's game but without any of the painting/modeling I don't like. Also - the rules are much simpler than playing regular Fantasy. Shame there's not more lizardmen though. All games need more lizardmen.

RATING: 9
I am making this a 9 right now with the assumption that it may become a 10 for me shortly. There are a number of things I have been looking for in games since I started my non-electronic gaming renaissance almost ten years ago. Number 1 was a miniatures game without miniatures. That is the reason I like Summoner Wars so much. Other titles have had a similar goal but I always found them lacking in one respect or another. I had never heard of the Diskwars system before but I have to say I am incredibly impressed. The streamlining of basic miniatures gaming tropes makes this extremely accessible and the units (so far) feel varied and exciting in their own regard. At the time of this writing I am in the middle of a multi-week plan to start a BattleCON league at my work and am now having a crisis about an all consuming desire to switch to Warhammer: Diskwars. Sigmar preserve me.

RATING: 9.1
When I was younger and had the time, I really enjoyed playing miniature games. This game definitely gives you the feeling of playing the tabletop game with none of the hours of painting & modelling. I used to enjoy the painting, but the game was always more fun. Some parts of the game feel wonky, especially scrums when multiple levels of units fight and the rulebook does a horrible job of explaining how it works. The set-up and terrain is interesting and the unit building feels a lot like building an old army list. Some of the units seemed really powerful, but I chalk a lot of it up to not having knowledge of how the game works and prioritizing targets poorly. One of the great things about the game that makes it feel very tactical is that melee is not dice based (primarily its just ranged attacks that use dice) and so it makes moving the disks to get proper position incredibly important. I expect my initial rating is heavily biased by Warhammer nostalgia (the theme comes through great) but the mechanics were still fun and with the new races & expansions, I think that it will continue to be a favorite; especially since it handles multiple players easily.

A game that surprised me in a good way. Less preparation than Warhammer Fantasy and units that came right out of this universe.

Fast playing time and set up makes this an excellent skirmish game for 2 Warhammer fans.

It costs 10% of the miniatures game to start playing ... what do you want more ? Perhaps a sturdy, non gliding playing map, but this game is great for its cost !

It's got the feel of a miniatures war game, but it plays a lot smoother and I can actually remember all the rules! That said, it does suffer a bit from keyword overload. Every unit has special abilities that you need to reference the rules for--but at least the keywords are printed on the discs!

Warhammer Diskwars is to minis games as Pathfinder Adventure Card Game is to RPGs.  It takes an all-consuming hobby game and boils it down to something that can be played in an hour but still captures much of the essence of the original.

Others have tried to do this for minis games, but none that I have played succeeds as well as this one.  Rich in strategy and theme, with a huge variety of options just 6 months into the release (6 'full' factions and 4 'teaser' factions, all of which feel different), this game really fires on all cylinders for me.

okay game. moving disks is a bad mechanic. very inaccurate. Units die way too fast. By the end of the third turn (out of five) both armies have been lost the majority of its units. At this point you'll have more orders to give out then you have units available. By the end of the game there is hardly anything left on the board. 

Works if you like that sort of thing. But it wasn't for me.

It's also another FFG game where to have real army building options you need to buy multiple sets.

The manual is terrible but the rest of this game is awesome. I love boardless combat, and this does it very well. The only house rule we use is to make it so you can't measure until you declare your target so you have to use your judgment to move and shoot (and naturally you can't backtrack once you start moving given it's boardless nature so you better be sure you can make it).

Tried too hard to be a miniature game that is really just a CCG style, lots of special combos type game.

Fun and fast game.  I find set up takes almost as long as game play.  First you have to buy your army then pick you activation cards then pick and place terrain then place spawn cards then place your disks.  Sound long - ya it is.

Once you are done with this longish set up the game play is pretty fast and fun.  The special abilities are unique and require modifying you play style

Brilliant concept: a minis game w/out the minis! While minis are cool, they're expensive. Also, the discs used in this serve to measure movement, have all the necessary stats printed on them, and are in full colour right out of the box! Simple rules, lots of variety, plays quickly. Loving it with my kids ages 10 and 13. Can't wait for more!

Good miniatures game without actual miniatures.

So it is a shame that this game fell a bit flat overall for people because it really does what it does well. It gives you that feeling of playing a miniatures game, moving regiments around, forming battle lines and protecting flanks in an easy to digest system. The biggest perk is that what I have for this game would amount to thousands of dollars in GW product but without the issues of procuring, assembling and painting. It gives me that Warhammer feel at a fraction of the cost with none of the hassle. I just wish it did better and opponents were easier to find.

Sits awkwardly on the boundary between a beer swilling action game and a tedious precision tactics game. Doesn't really satisfy either.

like warhammer, but fun. It does actually feel quite a bit like warhammer. Very simple ruleset but with lots of fine print and special effects spread over the top. This can be a bit annoying in the early games until you know the armies well.

One the face of it this looks like an attractive quick-playing wargame. The movement mechanism is a great way to speed things up, but there are still numerous fiddly rules and modifiers to apply to prevent this from being truly accessible. In addition when all the discs just pile on top of each other it all becomes a bit tiresome.

I am hugely impressed with this game right now. I was surprised by how deeply strategic it feels, more strategic than any other game I have played of this ilk (Battlelore 1ed, Heroscape, Summoner Wars). The system is very original and I feel it will take me some time to fully explore it. 
I expect this game to become one of my all time favourites.
--------------------------------------------
Every game it gets better and better. I love the army creation aspect and the unit movement (with the freedom that comes with not using a hex or square board). Feels much less abstract than in similar games.
--------------------------------------------
For me, three regiments per player and fight to the death is the way to play this game. LOVING IT!

This could have been a great way to scratch that miniatures gaming itch; unfortunately, it hasn't been adopted by many in my area, and I have a hard time roping in new players when scrum-resolving winds up with such twisted, non-intuitive rulings being made.

Tried this evening. I really enjoyed the game and hope to play again!

UPDATE
Played it again and it captures the feeling of the miniatures game very well. Bumped up my rating accordingly. I only wish they didn't put these big heroes and kept to rank-n-file. 

UPDATE
I find this game very well done - if not for some details - and a lot of fun. That said, I think this game is also something I'd call stressful. It is almost chess-like in its moves, one mistake and you're dead. It requires too much brainpower from me, while I prefer more relaxing games where I have to make bets on what's the best course to take. 

I've bumped this up to "8".

First rating after only a SOLO scenario (will edit at a later point)
Coming from a "Warhammery" background as a player, this game didn't appeal to me when it first came out, as I believed it was a washed down version of WFB. I recently picked it up at a very convenient price, and I 'm glad I did: in fact I was totally wrong! This game is in a league of its own, all the while keeping high the thematic feeling of Warhammer. I only just soloed the learning scenario (which comprises just the bare-bone mechanics of the game) but it is already evident to me that it might be better than "normal" WFB (the one with the minis). Highly tactical but not as convoluted (and dragging) as his more famous brother. Alternating turns between players is achieved through the selection of "command cards". This grants the game a "flow" which is WAY more exciting than the "I go-You go" rule of old. ALL randomness has been stripped from this game, leaving it only to "missile" troops. Which lends to Warhammer: Diskwars a very tactical, yet vibrant feel.

will edit as soon as I get to play it against other players (I sure hope thats soon)

What I didn't like about Warhammer miniatures games was all the rules, stats, measuring, etc. that you had to handle. All that and the money and time commitment is fixed in this "version". Still, I dare we'll have to wait some time untill we have several different armies and many units for each of them. Army customization, with the base set, might fall short for many people.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (June 2014)

I was keen on trying this but I was sorely disappointed. I have to confess my only play was with 4 players and there were big rules holes so I need to give Warhammer: Diskwars another chance.

In theory I should like the game a lot, but in practice there are 3 things I hate. 1. Lots of downtime playing with 4 players. I think this is only a 2 player game. 2. The movement is great on paper, but very clumsy in practice, many times we accidentally slide the unit in a wrong way and you can’t correct this with a 100% certainty. This matters a lot when you are trying to pin an enemy unit. Diskwars definitively needs a mat to avoid this. On this same point, it seems I hate games in which you need to move with great precision (X-wing, Wings of War) and have a ruler to see if I’m in range or not. I much prefer the way Summoner Wars and Mage Wars handle this issue, that is, I love moving by areas and not worrying about millimeters when I’m moving. 3. I really hate the way initiative is handled on this game. I’m pretty sure there is some underlining strategy to this, but from my limited vantage point it was pure luck who went first. To make things worse, in my only play I didn’t have a steady tactic in my human army (we played with the recommended sets), so when it really counted my opponent always went first as he was the number 1 player. This seems to me as a very unfair advantage. To me, a player shouldn’t go twice in a row just because he got lucky with a card. I have never played the actual miniatures game, but I hope pure luck isn’t the way to decide initiative. 

Still I´m rating Warhammer: Diskwars somewhat highly because it is the kind of game I should enjoy. Love the game components and the idea behind it. It is great you can make your own army so it seems it has lots of replayability. It was weird to me this FF game didn’t have any expansion, but I just saw them as new arrivals today. As a whole, this is very similar to me to games like Wings of war and Star Wars X-wing. For now I prefer Warhammer over those ones but just barely. It seems this is just not my kind of game. Love the art and the theme.

Bottom line, I need to give Warhammer: Diskwars another chance, but I don’t have high hopes for it. I’m very glad I didn’t bought it. The clumsy movement and the initiative rules (probably) killed this game for me.

Current Rating: 5.0

Surprisingly solid game, though at first it looks like Pogs (they're back, in Alf form).  Diskwars does a couple of things right that I enjoy.  It captures the feel of fantasy armies clashing.  I don't feel the need to own this, and, say, Warmaster.  I love the command card system, and the game doesn't use many dice, which is a pleasant change of pace from most fantasy battle games.  There is a lot of depth to the game, and lots of potential for army building.  I'm honestly surprised the game hasn't caught on more.  I strongly recommend Diskwars.

Only play this with 2. 3 and 4 is way too chaotic. Even so, you should probably just go play Battlelore 2nd Edition cus it actually has cool miniatures and the game is much more strategic than just flipping disks from one side of the table to clash in the middle.

Diskwars is a very solid system (unless you play on a slippery surface). The flipping of the disks is an easy way to handle movement ranges without having to resort to a ruler for every single move. I also like the combination of deterministic melee and dice based ranged attacks. The Warhammer Fantasy theme is another plus.

Miniatures game without the need for miniatures, but any ambitions of streamlining are struggling to make themselves felt in a permutational vortex of situational abilities, conditional bonuses, activation sequences and estimation and consideration of millimetre-scale distances; good play means precisely processing all of this without fault. A lot of game in a small box, though, and high-quality components. Would like to try a four-way battle royale. Limiting turns to, say, 90 seconds per activation could also be worth trying.

Fast playing version of Warhammer Fantasy Battles miniature game. Much lower barrier to entry as well.

Does need to be played on a mat or something. On a normal surface flipping the tiles is very unnacurate.

RATING: 9
Feels like a real battle in the Old World. Some say it's chaotic, but which battle wasn't? Some say the disks are fiddly, but this is a battlefield, where nothing is measured with a measuring tape. For me it's better than the WFB, because you don't have to roll 40 dices anymore to solve a single clash of 2 units. Instead of that you have 20 units on the table and may really feel like a general moving his troops against your opponent.

A very satisfying experience, even if you have just lost to your opponent. The game is fast paced, so you can always try a new strategy in the next game right after. Totally recommended.

Warhammer: Diskwars is a game of ferocious, fast-paced tabletop battles for two to four players. At the heart of the game's conflicts are its disks, which represent heroes and units from across the Old World. During the game, you activate these disks, flipping them end over end to move them across the battlefield, position them to attack, and interact with terrain and other disks it overlaps. When one disk covers another disk, the disk on top is considered to be "pinning" the disk below it; this prevents the pinned disk from activating, and at the end of the round, overlapping disks must fight one another. By maneuvering carefully to pin your opponent's units, you can strike them down, seize control of the battlefield, and win the day!

* The rules have some "holes" in them: 

- http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/15615891#15615891. The order of resolution for melee could have been better defined. This definitely requires some serious thinking. The rulebook does not include the result of such thinking: it contains rules that cannot always be applied (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/15755653#15755653). Maybe the Scrum Melee resolution rules should have been written differently, with a different method of resolution. The rules should have at least recognized that there are ambiguous cases. It really feels like they did not think thoroughly enough before writing the rules.

- Do ally disk participate in an Engagement (there are hints that no, they don't, but it is not spelled out in the definition of Engagement)

* Components

The dice are beautiful, very well made (feel heavy, nice embossed drawings, nicely delineated).

The disks are a little blurry, especially in low light, and a little dark.
The printing on the extension boxes (Legion…, Hammer…) is also blurry.

The corners of the box, inside, have lost their ink: this does not look good, but this is a detail.

The ruler was bent (the deck of cards pushed on it during transport). FFG was prompt at sending a replacement.

The rulebook looks very nice.

* Rules

The rulebook uses graphics to mark some sections, like for interpreting battle dice results (in addition to using text): this is very convenient, as it makes finding the information quite fast.

I did not like the presentation in two steps: some important rules are only described in the presentation of the intro game, some are repeated: this makes the information scattered, which is not so convenient as a reference.

The index at the end helps. Unfortunately, it is really not complete.

* After 1st game:

The length of the terrain is not a big problem, even without really standing up often, despite the fact that most of the action too place on the side opposite to me.

I liked the strategic placement of the terrain (much harder than placing the deployment cards).

I liked the timing in 5 rounds: it adds an element of strategy (timing, when the goal is to occupy the opponent's zones at the end).

I like how the game accelerated thanks to the fact that there are fewer and fewer troops: this gives a mounting sense of urgency, and this makes every move more important, as a single disk dying is a bigger deal, relatively.

I liked the meta-game of Bold-Steady-Devious. We laughed a few times when revealing the cards when the timing was crucial. I did not feel cheated: it is normal to sometimes lose the race, because I sometimes win it.

The command cards each had a special feel, this was nice.

There were no rule problems, really, that was good.

I liked how it did not feel right that a disk with flying would have to stop on the swamp, as I thought… and the rules confirmed the thematic interpretation. More generally the theme is well conveyed in the mechanics. For instance, embattled disks must defend before attacking: this means that if a disk came to the rescue of a friendly pinned disk by pinning its attacker, the rescue will have an impact: it will be resolved first, which gives a chance to the originally attacked friendly disk to survive.

* After the 2nd game


I like the complexity of the gameplay brought by the large number of individual statistics and powers. Individual powers are varied, some trigger in specific conditions (Empowered,…), that can be triggered by cards or through other disks placed at a certain distance, etc. This creates a complex mesh of possibilities: imagining all the future combinations is too hard, would be too long. This makes the game look more like life, like its more complex/messy/real-life side. I like probing through this mesh of details and finding good ways of grasping them, of understanding the tensions on the battlefield, of sensing where the danger is, where the synergies are or how I could create them. I am attracted by the idea of mastering better and better a situation which is too complex, but where choices do matter—often in a decisive way, since no dice are involved in melee.

I did make a few strategic errors. Stupid ones. There is no going back, shifting gear, mostly: a blatant loss emerges some time from the complexity of the battlefield, and I realize my mistake, but it's too late.

I realize I am a bad Diskwars general, the game is challenging: I keep making many small strategic errors.

I do not like making a strategic error, in another miniature game like Lord of the Rings: Combat Hex: a bad choice of army is a *single* strategic mistake with an effect that reverberates throughout the game. But in Disswars, strategic (planned moves/placements) mistakes often affect only a single unit, or just a few, so there is still hope that it can be recovered from.

Again, I liked how the battlefield cleared up along the way, with faster later turns: I was eager to see the conclusion of the game, of capitalizing on my previous successes (many disks killed => easier job for me now), of having to think with a simpler board situation (qualitative change).

One element of the game feels light: the mess of scrums (with pinning, counter-pinning, entanglements,…), the importance of turn order in pinning. These things feel like they are hard to control. But there is a layer of thinking around these more chaotic aspect: for melee, keeping the troops apart so that they are not pinned by a single enemy, preparing a rear-guard that can come to the rescue of the frontline; for the turn order: knowing your opponents (few) command cards. So, again, "soft" skills are needed, for this game, guiding principles that give a good control of a messy reality, despite all the situations in which it can branch. An abstract game like Tash-Kalar can even feel more random, to me: it is hard to know where the opponent will strike, with so many possible shapes that can be made, it is hard to know where the blow will land, for the same reason. In Diskwars, these things are a little more legible.

Feels messy, compared to another miniature-like game like Claustrophobia, or even Earth Reborn: there are many more units, with more special powers. This is not meant as a negative: it's only the difference between working by oneself, or with a very small team of like-minded people, and managing an army, a large team of people with very different skills and personalities.

In both cases, though, I get the pleasure of making the troops work together. This is harder to do in Diskwars, with all the interplay of ranges, powers, activations, etc. This pushes me away from Diskwars: I get less of this pleasure because it is simply harder to pull off, synergies are harder to use (maybe the characters are too far away for a good reason, and they'll never use their synergy).

What I get in exchange in Diskwars is the mess of a larger fight, a fog of war that's intriguing, that I want to lift with more practice, skills that I want to get in order to handle the complexity better and better.

* After game 3

I like how the amount of damage done by ranged attacks makes sense thematically: 2 for arrows, 3 for a crossbow, for magic arrows, for big weapons.

I did not feel so excited, maybe because individual actions do not feel so consequential. Killing units when the goal is to kill heroes did not feel so good: I wasn't sure how this would benefit my goal.

I still want to play it: I want to learn to stop making mistakes (either tactical or strategic).

The terrain placement is very strategic, and can have a strong impact on the game. It is important to have an idea of how the battle will play, in order to make good decisions here.

The pre-built regiments do a very good job at presenting the available disks and command cards: they are apparently all covered (or almost).

In Tash-Kalar, I could see my skill reach a higher level with every first few game (in the number of Legendary beings summoned, and in the number of successful goals)—I observed the same for Race for the Galaxy. Not in Warhammer: Diskwars: I only see new mistakes, there is so much to learn in order to be good that I can't use much of what I learn in the first few games for the next one. In that sense this is a harder game.

The initiative management through the selection of command card is much more than a game of rock-paper-scissors: the distribution of card speeds (?) of my opponent compared to mine really makes me/him feel faster or slower, and it is possible to play around this distribution. For example, my opponent had Steady, Devious, Devious, Slow and I was 1st player: if I needed to play first, I could always use my Steady card and have the initiative. This adds a nice layer of theme and tactics to the game.

* After game 4

This is the first game where I had the feeling that I "knew everybody" well enough (not perfectly, though: I had forgotten that Teclis has the amazing Immune (Arcane), that the Bloodthirster has Resistant (Arcane),…). This was also the first game where we had no new disk or command card to discover.

We *both* placed the terrain in a strategically sound way, maybe also for the first time.

We both played in a sound way for the first time, except for a failed evil plan I had: I am still learning about basic strategy.

I did not read the goal of my opponent in their actions, but this is crucial information: my opponent had only 9 disks in their custom army, with the objective of 5 VP/hero killed; by killing 2 heroes (and not dying) my opponent had an assured victory: having guessed his goal would have made a big difference in my strategy. This is a nice layer of reasoning.

We used the various powers of our heroes mostly once or twice, which is great: it means every game is different: maybe the Sun Dragon will blow fire 3 times in a game (that would be a lot), maybe none, etc. For instance, Teclis never used his powerful magical attack, in this game: this will be for another game.

We laughed a few times when selecting cards: the game of double-guessing was fun (like in poker, etc.). This is where most of the social part of the game is, for us.

The command card initiative mechanism is nice: initiative does not matter so much during the first round, and the player can discover each other's cards and learn their speed and powers. When initiative starts to matter more, around round 3, where melee is generally very important, the players can strategize around their knowledge of the opponent's cards. These learning and strategize phases give satisfying tasks: first learn, then apply the knowledge gained.

However, I am still not enamored/awed by this game. Maybe because I still find it a little too complex (not complicated): I can't help finding a game like Claustrophobia more elegant: it gives a clearer vision of what has to be done, the challenge is not in knowing details, but more about making the right choices without having to learn a lot about the game. It's almost a choice between a game that rewards culture/experience more (Diskwars), and a game that does so much less (Claustrophobia). Or a game for initiates (Diskwars) and more democratic/directly accessible/enjoyable/manageable (Claustrophobia, Tash-Kalar, even Race). The main problem I see with Diskwars are the *errors* newer players can easily do (by forgetting about the existence of some characteristics of disks or cards [only to get a big Magic 4 in the face on their opponent's turn], etc.). Diskwars gets a visible part of its complexity through quantity: this is nothing remarkable (put enough moving/varied parts and you get something that takes time to explore).

The turns evolved in the usual, varied way: 1: positioning, a few siege ranged attacks. 2: a few skirmishes. 3: big melees. 4: end of the fewer, remaining melees. 5: conclusion, last "details", fast.

* Some time after game 4

The richness that Warhammer: Diskwars brings in term of situations attracts me and makes me want to play again. I remember the couple of last games, which showed vastly different situations. 2 games ago, there were High Elf archers peppering my troops with arrows, my Orcs trying to hide in the woods, which also delayed them too much. The last time, my troops were slowed downs by two narrow passes, and we had a nice episode where Kairos intimidated a Sun Dragon, freeing an important piece, with Archaon (?) coming to the rescue, pinning the Dragon and giving it the final blow—very cinematic. There two games were vastly different, qualitatively. This what makes me come back to Warhammer: Diskwars: the variety between games, and the breadth of the strategic principles that I must learn in order to stop making mistakes.

The paradox is that I want to return to Diskwars more than I want to return to Tash-Kalar, even though I have a better grasp of Tash-Kalar, even though I don't make mistakes in Tash-Kalar, only sub-optimal plays—meaning that I only feel like each game is better than the previous one, whereas in Diskwars, my fate in a game can be decided by one bad strategic choice (like reinforcing with Kairos the Bloodthirster just too short of the Elven troops).

* Even later after game 4

I really like how each game is qualitatively very different. The variety of possible terrains and terrain placement, scenario cards, command cards (and units) has made each game very different.

I also like the customization that we can do at the beginning of the game: that's something which is not done in so many games (it can be done in Magic (with drafting), Lord of the Rings: Combat Hex, Heroscape (in a more limited way),…), so Diskwars holds a special spot in my collection, with just a few other games that share its (quick) customization feature (even with the base game, where each Race has enough units for 3 regiments with different units, so there is a lot of room for customization within each Race, and by using 1 or 2 races in one army).

* Current conclusion

+ Rich board and hand situations, full of little details that do matter (remembering that the Plaguebearer removes Empowerment at short range…). Puts players in a more "real life" complexity than a euro (where the complexity is more puzzle-like, or clearer maybe). The skills required to play are different: options seem to be more open, in Diskwars, with so much freedom to move, to position oneself in the right terrain, to read your opponent's moves, to sense the very real danger, etc.

+ Wide range of key tactical situations: I remember quite many such situations from previous games, which is not something offered by so many games (even games with cards and variety in the "tableau" like Agricola or Race for the Galaxy). The high number of memorable situation is a bit like in Magic: the Gathering, where some games are just epic, to an even higher degree.

- Setup is a little long, with the disks to fetch.

+ Interesting powers, disk variety, and synergies.

+ Nice increasing round speed. In my games, most of the moves were played in the first 2–3 turns.

- The moves feel less consequential than, say, in Yinsh, in Innovation, or even in Race (with a good 6-cost development). Maybe the role of each move is less obvious (like killing units when the goal is to kill heroes).

+ The task is to use pieces strategically, to understand the specific good uses of each disk together with the other disks, cards and terrain, to anticipate the opponent's moves. This is a nice change from resource management/planning/resource engine games. While you win with victory points, the way they are awarded does not transform the game so much into a race to the highest number of victory points: it remains a battle (this is accomplished with secret goals, which gives points either individually for each casualty, or in lumps of 5.  If you get victory points in lumps of 5, the goal is not as much to make points as to kill the right disks or to get your own disks in the right position. If you get them one by one, then the goal is not as much to get one more, but to pass thresholds of 5, 10, etc.—unless you think that your opponent also gets VPs one by one).

- Not complicated but a little complex, with lots of little details that can trip new players (crucial powers that are not used/that surprise, etc.). A visible part of the complexity lies in the number of details (powers and statistics on disks).

- After ~10 games, I find it a bit inconvenient to have multiple action during the turn: some players can be bored while waiting. I am not, though, as keeping in mind the powers of everybody and having a clear perception of them on the board keeps me *very* busy (not to mention handling and preparing combos, etc.).

As a tabletop battle game, it gets the job done, though some aspects of it (Impact is a ridiculously OP ability, the cards are an interesting idea but not developed enough, regiment size is laughably small) are less than ideal... if you're looking for a boardgame equivalent of the tabletop battle game though, look away. The rules are a mess, in a typical tabletop battle fashion there is a flood of special abilities and you have to remember how ALL of them work to make good decisions.

The lessened randomness of the combat is both a blessing and a curse, and more of the latter. It's just not very fun. You land on an enemy disk, the combat phase comes along, everything has already been resolved even before you begin. This would've been a sort-of interesting puzzle, but the way you resolve combat is dry and unexciting.

Don't even try to play a 3 or 4 player game. The rules are so unclear and muddled that you'll lose an hour to set up even before you take your first move, and then another hour looking for answers to questions which aren't in the booklet. There's a reason that battle games have thick manuals with zounds of examples on different situations...

I'm barely enjoying this game, and I don't see a way for it to hit the table very often. Chances are I'm just going to sell it as soon as I get the opportunity. The game nominally works, but I don't think it's very good.

Sold it, I wouldn't be able to play it regularly and I wouldn't want to spend any more money on it. Disappointing.

After being utterly disappointed with X-Wing, due to its fiddlyness and the prospect of spending hundrets of euros on it, I decided to give these kinds of games one more chance with Diskwars. And this time I was not disappointed :)

Instead of getting pathetic 3 units, I get over 60!!! and 4 factions, with which I am actually able to play a real session of this game, without needing to buy 3 more core-sets and a bunch of expansions. Thus the cost-benifit ratio is rediculously better with Diskwars.

The fiddlyness of X-Wing was another bothersome aspect of the game which I could not bear. Using these movement templates was utter frustration to me. If several units are clustered together, it is simply impossible to move your unit properly, without having to lift up several other units, which is no fun at all. And "landing on" other units is especially annoying and poorly solved by the rules imo. Diskwars is far more intuitive in this regard. Flipping is much easier to use than having to apply movement templates. And "landing on", i.e. pinning other units is a core mechanic in this game instead of being a problem that needs to be dealt with like in X-Wing. So Diskwars beats X-Wing in this regard as well.

There are many other aspects in which Diskwars is better than X-Wing imo. In Diskwars there are ranged as well as melee attacks, wich is more diverse than just having ranged attacks. In Diskwars the special abilities seem far cooler and have a larger tactical impact on the game. At least melee attacks do not require dice rolling in Diskwars, which reduces randomness by a considerable amount. Terrain plays a more dominant role and can better be utilized in Diskwars. And more.

So, if you are looking for a miniature, table-top, skirmish type of game, buy Diskwars. It is rather cheap and you will definitely get your money's worth.

I've only played this a few times, but my impression is that there is as much complexity in this game as in a regular tabletop miniatures game, even though the rules are more streamlined. It's a lot cheaper to buy, obviously, demands no time investment to prepare, and can be set up and played rather quickly (unless you're AP prone). The base set includes four complete armies with a lot of possibilities for different combinations, which seems like great value to me. Just like in regular tabletop miniatures games, there can be some problems with measurement and the like, especially if you play on a smooth surface where the disks easily slide out of place. Also the mix between random ranged combat and deterministic close combat is a bit weird. Altogether it's great fun though, and I would recommend the game to anyone who is interested in tabletop minuatures games, but think that regular ones demands to much time or money.

Coming from a Warhammer fantasy/40k vet (played for a good 8 years) this is my favorite skirmish style game thus far. Simple yet full of tactics and dirty tricks! Don't let the silliness of flipping disks fool you - there is an awesome game in this box and it's backed with amazing Warhammer lore and art. Superb!

A fun and light "miniatures" game without miniatures.  It is fun to field an army without spending 100's of dollars.

The game would be rated higher if there were reference cards for the various units and abilities. For such a simple game at its core there is quite a bit of looking up rules, and picking up disks to check disks in a scrum.

In theory, it's [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/4192/warhammer]Warhammer Fantasy Battles[/url] without the need to paint your miniatures and with a lot of units for the price (plus the expansions, or a double core, whatever).

[i]In practice[/i], it's quite flimsy: imagine to flip the disk where you place the beer at the pub, many and many times. Now overlay it with other disks. Yes, that's it: a nitpicker player can wholly destroy your experience because you'll be (inevitably) inaccurate.

It's a pity because the mechanics aren't that bad at all, but the final result is rather bland.

----- Preliminary thoughts -----

Mini battle game without the minis. The disks seem pretty stupid at first, but they are a great idea:
-> they are used to calculate movement too
-> they have the stats and special skills printed on

The abundance and variety of skills make it a highly tactical game.

Also, it has a very good price and it is not long to play.

The problem is that it is really a 2 player game.

Incredible balance between ease of play and tactical depth. And, as a once miniature gamer, I'm quite surprised by the physical quality of the disks : a massive scrub of disks gives you a physical sensation of the massive fight that is taking place (quite like you would feel with miniatures). Except the fight is resolved in a couple of minutes (against tenth of minutes for the original Warhammer Battles). An impressive game by FFG.

Disclaimer:  I haven't played this game much yet.  The high rating reflects my excitement to try it again!  Also, I am not especially a War Hammer universe fan, but I enjoyed this game thoroughly anyway.

The game is like a miniatures game, but much more affordable, and much flatter.  Although you can customize your army, there is plenty to work with in one box.  It isn't merely a miniatures with counters though.  The disks move and attack using the shape of the disk itself.

I'm excited about this game because it has a good mix of tactical thinking, and chaos through random elements.  Plenty of dramatic moments, but plenty of careful thought as well.  Army design also allows for strategic thinking, but I haven't had the chance to play with my own army designs yet.

Also, despite using disks instead of miniatures, the game really does feel like a messy battlefield, with shouting soldiers, charging screaming orcs, horrific demons, and elegantly lethal elves.

31-08-2014. Rated after 1 play. Warhammer Diskwars is basically a miniature game with disks. You flip disks to determine movement. You roll dice for ranged attack and melee damage is resolved and assigned deterministically by overlapping disks. It's actually a fun tactical game, but it's really a mini's game with a different implementation. Fun, but I am not sure if it fills a niche that I need to fill in my collection.

It has a lot of the fun parts of minis games, the tactical gameplay, the physicality, and the fun combat, but without the headache of painting and buying minis. The core set has a good amount of content too, so even casual players (like me) will find plenty to enjoy here.

Don't like the melee rules, since they boil down to range estimation. The player who can estimate range more accurately will have an advantage over his opponent, especially as pinned disks cannot activate.

Also a 3 x 3 foot playing area is required to play, which I don't have. Additionally, the game comes without any kind of board or felt and is unplayable on a smooth surface due to the disk flipping mechanic.

Diskwars is like a miniatures game for a quarter of the cost of a miniatures game.  In this game players control armies of disks that move across the battlefield by flipping end over end.  If a disk overlaps an opponent's disk then they perform melee combat against each other at the end of a round.  Each disk also has a slew of other abilities available to it and the map consists of terrain and special deployment zones as well.  There is a lot of strategy and choices to make in this game and it's not terribly complicated or long either.

There are a couple things I do dislike, I kind of wish there was a little bit more content in this first offering.  Also, measuring out a 3'x3' square for the battlefield and marking this with cardboard corner pieces is both inaccurate and easy to disturb.  This can be remedied by buying a piece of felt and cutting it down to 3'x3' but felt is cheap, is this really not something they could have offered us in the box?  But the amount of play you get out of the box for such a reasonable price is hard to beat.

After playing some more I have come to the conclusion that this game is a bit more trouble than it is worth.  I have a lot of other 2-player dueling games and the flipping of the disks in this is a bit wonky even though it seemed like a really neat idea at the time.  Also, there isn't as much depth and variety to the abilities as I initially thought/would have liked.  Still a good game, I just have better and don't need one more 2-player dueling game.

Need to play more, but it seemed cool.

The movement mechanic is really cool, The base game comes with a lot of units and you can have some pretty big battles with it, and it happens to be very cheap.

The rulebook is pretty bad, random footnotes scattered throughout the 'learning-game', the 'regular-not-learning-game', and the 'random-information-that-we-couldn't-figure-out-where-it-belonged-because-this-rulebook-is-so-horribly-organized' sections of the rulebook. It is often very to find that very specific rule you're looking for because it is buried in one of the three nonsense sections sitting in a little box next to something barely related to it.

There are also several poorly chosen keywords, especially the initiative deciding rock-paper-scissors thing, Devious/Steady/Bold.....

I bought this game because I love the Warhammer universe but hate GW. It is deceptively challenging and gives you a nice taste of miniatures combat without the added cost and time. 40 bucks gets you 4 complete armies which is a good deal. It also lends itself to tournament or league play. Two more positives: games only last 30-45 minutes and the factions seem fairly balanced. There is no need for two boxes unless you are playing competitively. I am looking forward to the two expansions.

The only negative comment is the rulebook could have been better organized and the explanations for some aspects of the game i.e. resolving scrums could have been explained better. My rating may go up with more plays, but the rulebook knocks it down a notch.

Played a scenario with thee persons. Game captures the flavor of Warhammer really well, and eliminates the constant range checking.

What remains though is the constant rule-checking, it still has a lot of small little rules. It is an enjoyable rump. However, getting yourself pinned not only stops your movement, but your activation completely which can really be decimating.

The strange thing about this game is that the balance doesn't seem to be as good as in 'regular' Warhammer. As the range (the 'flipping' distance) is really easy to estimate, the small amount of action card options available sometimes give you no choices with which to avoid defeat. Also, if your units get killed, your options reduce further as to the point it is irrelevant to participate (what happened to one of your players).

As a result, choices are quite obvious a lot of times, so even though it is a quick, fast and free flowing skirmish, the whole game can (and usually) comes down to turn order.

Good try, enjoyable, would not mind another play. But not a game I would seek out or need to own.

There's no way around the fiddliness of flipping slippery disks over each other; a felt mat makes it better. 

Positively: Diskwars maintains the core experience of fielding and commanding an army in epic grimdark combat, minus the jank of stat sheets and millimeters and adult toysets. It's all on the table!

For context, I'm not a minis wargamer, and I likely never will be. This game is my opportunity to scratch a similar itch.

If the fluff weren't Warhams, I might not give two effs about the game system.  But the fluff is Warhams: thus, my sun dragon can cook himself with his own flame breath to murder the regiment of orks and plaguebearers pinning him astride their massive Hellcannon. Eeee.

The more I play this game, the more I really like it.  It gives you the feel of a faster miniatures game, and you don't have to use a tape measure or spend time painting.  

Although, it seems this is trying to fit a niche that isn't there.  Folks that want to play a GW miniatures game will spend the time painting and those that want a lighter, more compact game will play something like X-Wing (pre-painted minis).  It seems like this game may not get the same support from FFG as others as I assume they are worried about sales.  We'll see what kind of turnout the 2014 Worlds will bring in a few weeks.  I'm hoping to get some good games in!

This is usually my type of game, but this one doesn't make a very good first impression.

There are a lot more keywords than you might expect for a game of this weight. Meaning that your early games will involve a lot of looking through the manual constantly to see what everything does.

My other issue is the fiddlyness. You might have a disc with several tokens on top of it (wound tokens, activations tokens, etc) then you can move another disc on top of it. Now you have a stack of discs and tokens and you need to move everything around to see the printed numbers on each disc. It probably gets better with more plays, but again, it doesn't make a good first impression.

I would play again, but I would always reach for Summoner Wars, Battlelore, or any number of other dudes-on-a-map games first.

Rating is based off of initial play.

I see tons of potential here, and the core mechanic is cool.  It really does approximate a miniatures game, which is nice.

My biggest gripe, by far, is that melee combat is fixed (ie, given how much damage will be dispensed and received) where as ranged is dice based?  This seems to make no sense, particularly since the ranged shooting can deviate and hit your own guys.  

Cool system though, and there is immense value since the chits are the pieces.

Very good mechanics. Easy to prepare and play but deep in strategy decision and army building. Hope to see new expansion both for the actual armies and totally new ones.

This game is so clever, and I love how it's objective driven so you have to be very careful with your army composition. Thumb up.

An excellent reworking of the whole disc system. Great for folks like me who don't have the time or inclination to paint WH minis. A deep, but not overly complex tactical system that does a decent job of recreating the minis game.

Fantasy battle without miniatures? Count me in. Needs more play.

With only one play, I don't think I've quite scratched the surface of this one, but I also wonder if I should be getting into other miniatures games with this one around. The appeal, of course, is that the miniatures are disks so there's no assembly, no painting, and no measuring. There's still some fudge factor due to the disks skittering around, but in general there's a good, maybe great, game here.

I definitely want to play this some more.

RATING: N/A
A huge strategic battle clash of opposing armies using a board-less battle system. Random terrain tiles. Select a general and units of different sized disks. Play command cards to control units. Special dice resolve range attacks. Unique flip-disks movement system to position and pin opponents for melee. A four player game is susceptible to thumb-twiddling down time. You must use the no-backsies rule--it is impossible to remember original positions of the disks if a player changes their mind.

Like: Warhammer Fantasy! Disk Movement. Involved setup. Army Building. Hidden Goals. Melee Combat.

Dislike: Ranged ruler came bent. Ranged attacks. Highly Underrated. Bleak future of expansions.

Aside: The involved setup and hidden goals of this game take it from a mediocre skirmish game to an epic war game. A very unexpected shining gem of a game.

A good tactical fantasy game. The combat system work well and each army has a distinctive fill. The special abilities on the different units is where the game really shines. 

The game has a weekness in the objective cards that isn't as interesting they potential could have been. 

Overall it's worthwhile game with lots of possibilities that don't take up too much space on the shelf. It's quick to set up and gives a good bang for the buck.

I was skeptical on this game until I played it.. And now I think it is great!
It gives you the same feeling of a standard miniature wargame (like Warhammer Fantasy), but without the required amount of money. You can focus on building your army and you are immediately ready to play. Obviously, it is not as good looking or customizable as a miniature game, but it is functional and very rewarding. 
The only reason the rating is not higher is that I want to play it more before the final rating.

Mehhhh.... Not what I'd hoped. It's playable and provides a Warhammer fix. I just didn't feel it.

Basically Warhammer fray in a flat (thus portable!) format. Very nice substitute when you can't play Warhammer: wether you are on vacation or traveling.

A tabletop miniature's experience without the expensive and time consuming miniature's. This is the best thing to get for someone who wants to have epic table top wars but doesn't want to invest all of their time and money into miniature gaming.

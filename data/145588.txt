What seemed like a filler was think-ier than I expected.  The decisions can be agonizing, and I like how the mechanisms interlock.  Red and orange plantations are a little close, and some of the tile icons are TINY!  Otherwise, a solid game.

Fun tile laying game. Simple rules, lots of variability from game to game. One problem is that the manufacturer made an effort to make the tiles reminiscent of citrus. Unfortunately, the red, pink and orange colors which were chosen for the tiles are hard to distinguish if the light isn't bright enough.

A very pleasant tile acquisition and placement game that played quite well with 5 players on first play for 3 of the 5.  I like the simplicity, length, appearance and ease of the game.  Citrus might serve nicely as a gateway game, though it plays a bit on the abstract side of things.

I felt, after one play, the game played you. That could change after several plays but there where unfortunately nothing in the game that compels me to play it again. In Tigris and Euphrates everything this game attempts to do is done better... Mainly you have 2 actions each turn.

Just read the rules.  Seems interesting.  Like many of the games I've been interested in lately, the rules are simple but the play and the interaction look fairly deep.  However, the rules make it feel like an abstract and I'm not sure how much traction I'll get at home to play it.  At its heart, it's a tile laying, area majority/enclosure game; however, in order to buy tiles you need money and to get money you need to harvest previously laid tiles, removing them from the fight for area majority/enclosure points.  I'd be very interested to play it and depending on the box size and the price point, I'd potentially be interested in owning it.

Fantastic abstract Euro game. The constant dilemma of deciding whether to pull a worker for cash or leave it out for scoring is really the heart of the game. Gameplay is tense, tight, and offers very difficult choices, but the rule set is incredibly simple and ultimately the game feels pretty light, which is why I like it so much. You could teach this to just about anyone, but it's still very satisfying for gamers.

Citrus is a tile-laying majority game with some modest similarities to [person=2][/person]'s [thing=127997][/thing], [thing=63759][/thing] by [person=7][/person] and [person=173][/person], and (so I am told) [person=7]Kramer[/person]'s [thing=19100][/thing].  Players pay coins to draft rows of colored "plantation" tiles that they then add to the board.  Your options for placing tiles is quite limited.  You can start a new plantation region orthogonally adjacent to any finca (a small house on the board), but only so long as no player has already started a plantation region of the same color next to the same finca.  Alternatively, you can add tiles to your own existing plantation region of the same color, but regions of the same color owned by different players may never touch.  You quickly run out of money to buy tiles (and meeples to mark your regions), so the game allows you to spend turns "harvesting" your regions, earning a combination of points and money but ceding control of the tiles.  However, whenever a fina is entirely surrounded, it scores points to the players with the largest adjacent regions, so harvesting too aggressively hurts your ability to compete in finca majorities.

And thus you have the central tension: you want to buy a lot of tiles to make big regions around fincas, but you have to harvest regions when you run out of money; buying fewer tiles allows your smaller regions to persist longer.  The game adds a little bit of (to me) needless complexity, however, by adding special tiles that you can build over which allow you to take special actions on your turn, and by adding impediments (called "rocks") to building on certain spaces.  

The game continues until every tile is built, and I found this to take far longer than I wanted for a game of this weight and depth.  Part of the blame for this lies with my group.  A couple players seemed to have some pretty slow turns, especially at the beginning as they pondered all the options. But part of the blame has to be put on the shoulders of [person=8935][/person], who decided to turn a colorful tile-layer in a 90-minute game with a plethora of options.  Because it was a learning game, I think our session clocked in at well over two hours, which is a bit longer than I would want to play something like this. 

At the end of the day, the scoring structure is pretty rudimentary, and seems slightly out of balance with the complexity of placement rules (including special cases for encountering neutral--i.e., previously harvested--regions).  If I can find a group that can process this breadth of options quickly, I think the game could be a lot of fun once we know what we are doing.  But the first few learning games are going to be tough sledding, simply because there is not enough excitement for me in the game to justify the length and rule complexity.  It's a game that feels like it's competing in the wrong weight class.  I can't see any situation where I would choose [thing=145588][/thing] over, say, [thing=42][/thing].  And while it's better than games like [thing=127997][/thing], it's also four times as long.

Citrus presented itself as a friendly tile laying game with a few advantages over the Spiel 2013-competition (most notably Palmyra and Atacama). I won't go into the reasons here, they would take me too far afield. 

The game itself is a combination of fairly time-worn mechanisms (majorities and tile laying) which is in itself refreshing. There are a few rules which govern the addition of tiles to the game board, the most limiting of which is that each of the 4 exits of any finca or finca building spot must connect to a different type of tile area. There are bonus tiles on the board which entice the players to move in particular directions: not original, but still tried-and-tested. The author created a nice little circle of life in this game: having a majority in the size of a plantation around a finca nets you points, but in order to add to it you need money to purchase the tiles from a rather odd-looking market, and you only get money if you withdraw your meeple which denotes ownership of a plantation... which subsequently becomes neutral and can be claimed by other players (or yourself, using a different plantation).

All in all the stars are right for me to like this game, but while playing I found it limited me as player too much. At one point you simply have to withdraw meeples from the board in order to get money which is a bit boring; and a lack of new fincas means that at times you find yourself adding to planations you have little use for. There doesn't seem to be a clear difference between the start of the game and the end: you just solve local maxima for a while and then count up the proceeds. It's a shame, really: I had rather wanted to like this game, but as far as I could make out it wouldn't let me.

Players grow citrus fruit around finca's and try to maximise their victory points.  A tile laying/point scoring game that reminded me a lot of Euphrat & Tigris, however it took twice as long with half the tension.  The open information and myriad of points scoring opportunities have rise to lots of careful thought.  By all rights an acceptible game, but to me it just hightlighted how good Knizia is (or was?).

Has been compared with Seeland.  Although I like both games, Citrus rates a bit more highly owing to the potential interaction between scoring points.  Prefer it with 2 to 3 vs 4 to 5 players.  Solid tile placement.  (Thank you to the BGG member who agreed to ship to the US.)

[b]Rating based on - 5+ plays, 2 player[/b]
A tile placement area control game in which you are a citrus farmer trying to grow and expand groves of citrus with limited resources. You start the game with 5 workers and 6 pesetas, and you can earn more money only by harvesting and giving up claim on land around a finca. On your turn you can either build or harvest. When you build you must respect the placement rules and you can earn action tiles placed out on the board to be used during the game or saved for end game points. When you harvest you earn the number of coins to the right of your worker on your player mat which increases the further right you go. So the toss up is having a lot of guys out on the board helps you get area majority but having a lot of them on your board helps you get more money.

Plays great with 2 – I might even venture that lower player counts are best for this game because of the way the market refills and later players not having enough choices, agonising decisions to be made – should I build or harvest? what should I harvest? where should I place my tiles? is it likely that if I give up on this region I can get back in later? what bonuses do I want? what tiles do I take from the market? do I want to trigger a market refill? As the game continues, your options expand exponentially which can lead to some AP. The board is double sided so you can choose either a short or long game. A fantastic puzzle to solve with a high degree of replayability – the landscape tiles are randomly distributed and not all of them are used (in the short game anyway), the fincas, building locations, and the tiles drawn out of the bag will all be randomised as well. Great quality components, and the tiles are also colour blind friendly (different designs per colour) – also helps if you are in low light because the orange and red are quite similar. Has that 'feel good Euro' feel that we love - my gaming partner says it reminds him of a cross between Seeland and Finca but it reminds me of a cross between Walnut Grove and Qin. Either way, we really loved this one.

This was a really fun game, with loads of variability which I love, but I just realised that I had a LOT of farming themed games and as such decided to reduce my collection of those to introduce more unusual themes in my collection. Sadly, when you are trying to keep only a small collection of games some really great ones must fall on the sword to make room for others. It will be missed.

Elsőre pofonegyszerűnek tűnnek a szabályok, de van egy két apróság, amibe azért elég részletesen bele kell menni, utána kell nézni, hogy ha jól akarja játszani az ember, illetve menet közben is nagyon résen kell, hogy szabályos legyen minden lapka lehelyezése. Az egyszerűségéhez képest nagyon mély játék, iszonyatosan durva döntések jellemzik Muszáj hatalmas áldozatokat hozni, de hogy mit és mikor az a kulcsa a játéknak. Emiatt kicsit AP veszélyes. Játékmenetre kicsit hajaz a Haciendára, de pont csak annyira, hogy mindkettőt tudjam nagyon szeretni.

The basic tension in Citrus is between wanting to own large plantations because they score points and having to give up plantations to earn money which is the only way to grow your (other) plantations.

This is a tried-and-true dilemma so it obviously works (to some extent) but it is also very basic and unexciting (adding to the drab presentation). Coupled with a bit of, it seems to me, unnecessary rules overhead the game simply takes too long for the depth it is able to provide. The best move is often rather obvious, it is just the scarce money throwing a wrench in your plans. Thus, the game becomes a string of tactical timing decisions rather than allowing players to follow any sort of long-term strategy.

I've seen someone comparing Citrus to Tigris&Euphrates. And Citrus is completely not T&E. :) Nowhere the same tension. Nowhere the same ,,things to do now, right now, no matter the costs". The point distribution system is a little too flat. And this is what makes - for example - Thought the Desert a magnificent design is that you really want to get somewhere with your caravan. Nail biting want. 
Not in Citrus, which is much more family friendly in these terms (although rules are more complex than in Through the Desert).
The game is good, don't get me wrong. But it's just not enough in >40 games collection.
ALSO - the colour palette for the tiles is horrible (orange/red(brown))!!! I am not colorblind, but this just frustrating.

RATING: 7
Tile placement, block the others, score one way by surrounding, the other way by taking meeples - sounds like Carcassone crossed with Finca, but is very much its own game.  The dull board is soon filled with colourful orchards, and the gameplay is not nearly as simple as first appears.  Market mechanism is clever, but the random draw will annoy some.  The random nature of the finca pull will also swing some games, but played with a light touch I think it is fine and an interesting game.

This scratches a similar itch as Carcassonne, for me, except that you have more control over what tiles you get, more control over what tiles *other* people get, and oh yeah it's even more cutthroat.

An area majority game with multiple underhanded ways to control which regions are in contention and which aren't.

Also, pretty colors.

Very much an abstract game.
Players place tiles of various colors to create connected sections worth points.
It has a unique tile selection mechanic.
Players need to pay attention, as some of the placement rules and restrictions are easy to forget.

Seems such a simple premise - get the majority in your plantations surrounding a finca. But your money runs out quickly and you can't buy any more tiles, so you've got to return your workers from some of the plantations, which means you no longer have the majority, and the finca's nearly ready to score...still a great game though from 2 to 5 players.

This is quickly becoming one of my favorite games...  this is a puzzle game and the joy in this game is when all the possible little combinations jump out at you as you plan and strategies your best move. My friend and I learned this game very quickly as the rule book is so clear and easy to follow and understand. The components are of a great quality and are very colorful (although two of the colors are very close, pink and red); although the board starts very plane and dry looking, it ends colorful and vibrent. The game plays quickly on the smaller side of the board; the larger side offers more strategy and plays just as well with two players. This is a game I will be bringing to the table often. Just a joy to play.

Citrus is an almost abstract tile-laying game. The basic structure is simple. A player either buys new fields or harvests existing fields for points and more importantly money. New fields either extend existing plantations or form new plantations. The goal is to have the largest plantations around finca tiles when they are scored. Ideally, large plantations connect to multiple fincas and score multiple times. A few landscape tiles with special functions spice up the game.

The purchasing grid is a clever idea to limit choices and introduce trade-off decisions. Forming plantations from the tiles can be challenging. At the same time, the game pace is sedate. The type of choices doesn’t change throughout the game. For experienced strategy gamers the game can be too long for what is on offer. I like it as a casual non-stressful game with simple rules but still meaningful gameplay.

I really enjoyed this game. It's a tile laying game with an open market for your tiles and a clever mechanic for purchasing them.

Interesting little abstract tile laying game which feels very familiar, but offers still something new too. If there is even one AP-player, then prepare for some downtime issues, but with fast players the flow is good. 10 years ago I might have liked this better, but right now it's just ok. Which MIGHT mean, that it'll take some time before Citrus comes to the table next time.

Although after my first play I was enthusiastic, my second and third play made me a bit less enthusiastic. There is just not enough there to keep this interesting.

Some problems I experienced 
- very difficult to keep an overview of the situation with 4 players (or 5). I guess this game will be even better with 2 or 3.
- hard to recover from a bad start. Being blocked in the beginning will haunt you the whole game
- being last in play order is a very big disadvantage.

Nevertheless, this is a very original area control/majority game with a very original tile buying mechanism, elegant, colorful, thematically credible and easy to play game. Also the way you can earn money during the game is original and elegant.

Initial price was too high (40+ EUR). 
The English translation of the German rules contains some errors.

Minus: 1 - 4 (hard to keep a good overview) - 5 - 8 (no compensation for player order (dis)advantages?; errors in the english rules)

Nice activity to do, this game. Buy tiles, sell a man to get money back. Score majorities when a farm has been surrounded. Simple rules, but I am looking for some more controll. You always want to have first choice out of a market that has just been refilled. In our 4 player game the first two players had this all the time, while the others had to go for the leftovers. Also the bonus tiles in the field are not that useful. The points tiles are, but the rest, no need to go for them. So, some balance and controll issues. I need to play this again, as I do like tactical tile-laying games. Rating will be adjusted.

Update: I like the two player game much better than the 4 player, upgraded.

Interesting tile placement game that feels like a blend of Kingdom Builder, Carcassonne, and just a splash of Reef Encounter. In reality it most firmly occupies the Kingdom Builder territory but fails to match its variety and strategy. Citrus is Jones-ruled pre-collection.

I was skeptical that the comparisons to Hacienda and Through the Desert would end up helping Citrus all that much, as I tend to have an aversion to the "been there, done that" feeling while playing games. But in this case, it worked out. As with those two, you're trying to carve up the board in your favor, cutting others off, connecting yourself in key locations. There's an interesting aspect of picking which color to invest yourself in and where and knowing which ones you're going to bail on to collect money. The muted tan grid with an alphabet soup wasn't the most attractive board I've ever seen, but things spruce up nicely with the bright citrus-colored tiles. Diagonal adjacency was easy for me to forget, but whatever; it's certainly not a strike against the game. All in all, I felt like there were interesting decisions and enough here to merit multiple plays.

I guess I'm not much of an Allers fan, having traded away this, New Amsterdam and Heartland, with no intention of re-acquiring (possible exception of Heartland). That kind of medium/light-medium tile-laying abstract-euro feels very dated (2006 era?) in its gameplay, and Citrus is no exception.

I do like Piece o' Cake & Alea Iacta Est though.

[b]Citrus[/b] was traded away in a math trade 12/12/17. (Received Azul)
Received in a math trade (2/15/17)

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]I had heard about Citrus a while ago, but then it fell off my radar until it popped up in a local math trade. I was lucky enough to get a copy in the trade and so far I've really enjoyed playing. This game feels like a classic Euro in terms of the rules, player interaction and the artwork. 

The rule set is quite simple and straight forward, but similar to some of my favorite games there is plenty of room for clever play and planning without having to wrestle with a rule book. This is a huge plus for me, especially if I plan on introducing a new game to my wife. This is a game you can start playing and teach while you go, the rules are that straightforward. 

Citrus is definitely not a multiplayer solitaire experience; if you only pay attention to what you are doing on the board you will get crushed. You have no choice, but to respond to the moves your opponents make and plan accordingly. Even buying tiles from the market can trigger certain events which may benefit your opponents. 

As far as the artwork goes this is a Klemens Franz game, but it doesn't jump out at you when it's on the table. The tiles are bright and colorful and definitely the highlight of the whole production. Everything else is basically shades of brown with very little artwork on the boards or other tiles. It took me a long time, but I've come to appreciate certain games despite their appearance with Castles of Burgundy being a prime example. Unfortunately I think this will be a deterrent for some folks, especially if they dismiss it as an "old" game.

I am extremely happy to have Citrus in my collection, especially since it is a game my wife enjoyed. Citrus now  sits on the shelf with games like Finca which offer similar experiences in terms of rules complexity to depth of decisions.[/i]

RATING: 7
It has a Hazienda feel about it, where most turns are about spending money to expand your fields but you also need to take turns to score/abandon fields in order to gain the money needed to acquire the next set of fields. So the race is on to enclose the scoring huts with your fields before you're forced to abandon them for lack of money. You also want to get a big long tentacled field if you can that scores big-time against multiple scoring huts. The game doesn't easily allow/encourage defense against this kind of approach so may as well jump on board. I liked the row vs column choices of how to buy tiles - it provides a nice decision each turn without generating AP. I thought the game played cleanly and fast enough that it would encourage replay. Yes, it's Euro-y and the board appears bland to begin with, but the luck mix is good and it provides enough twist on area majority that it feels fresh.

Quite celebral tile laying game with a cool market mechanic. As often with Jeffs game this offers a non-obvious dilemma of two ways of scoring, where one scoring is better, but leaves you with less money and more restricted choices - perhaps somewhat comparable to the dilemma in Patchwork with the choice bnetween buttons and time. Its my kind of game. Ratings may rise if I bring it to the table more often.

After first try, a five player game:

The mechanics are easy and work fine. We played with the promo expansion and the well seems very strong. three players got a weel in their first play and they ended up 1st, and shared 2nd. 

I think this game suffers a bit from the fact position makes a different and there is nothing you can do about it. I got to place one Finca and never got to choose tiles from a full board. The player who won had a full board to choose from several times.

Medium-weight plantation tile placement game, with area control mechanisms. Plays very nicely with 2-players and has mechanics that resemble to [thing=822][/thing] (you place tiles) and [thing=27173][/thing] (you buy sets of tiles from a market), along with some bonus actions that can be taken by claiming special tiles. I had fun playing with it, but it wouldn't score high in my list, as I find [thing=822][/thing] and [thing=27173][/thing] much more interesting and with more options.

In Citrus, players either buy tiles which they then place on the board in chains of the same color tile, and then place a meeples on one to show claim, or they remove one or more claim meeples and score points for the length of their chains, and money for the number of workers they are not using. As the game progresses, when a house tile is completely surrounded by tiles, it scores for whomever has the first and second place in number of tiles included in chains where those chains are in some way adjacent to the house. This creates a really interesting dynamic of trying to snake chains of tiles between multiple houses. This gets tricky as each house demands a different color on each of it's orthogonal adjacencies. Not only that, but you can't merge your chain with a chain of the same color belonging to another player. You CAN merge with an abandoned chain of the same color however. Add to this that the board is littered with one time use special action tiles you collect when you build on top of them. You play until all the houses are placed. The game has a fantastic set of short term planning with a lot of tactical choices.

Well, you really don't feel like a team of orange picking workers but on the other hand the theme is present when you wisely have to decide whether to harvest or to buy and plant. There are intersting mechanics such as the market and weird rules such as the neutral tiles which from time to time block a lot of space. A more than ok game that stays abstract, low-weighted and relatively short in playing time.

So, spatial gameplay, should be fun, right? Only the board is swarming with (for me unwelcomed) gameyness - the special tiles, the mechanisms and cogs and whatnot. Which results that supposedly very interactive game (well somewhat at least) gets the VP salad treatment – too many points (a bit here, a bit there) are only gained in small increments, resulting in very close score with a high number. Meh. Carcassonne is still the king. 

Ranking went down for the mediocrity.
Rating down to 1.0 because: uninspired. Yeah it's a crime.

I really like the bright, colorful box cover; very nice!  I was hoping that game inside the box would instill the same feeling that the cover art invoked, but unfortunately it did not.  That's not to say that the game isn't good, but I definitely didn't feel like I was out harvesting citrus in a plantation or anything.  The game itself is easy to understand and play, but isn't necessarily overly exciting.  The market mechanism was interesting, but the tile placement and scoring reminded me a lot of "Through The Desert" (not a game I like) in some ways.  The tiles are colorful, but the red and orange are REALLY close and can be tricky to distinguish depending on the light.  The board itself is not very attractive, but it serves it's purpose.  My feeling is that the "SHORT GAME" is plenty long enough; any more and I think the game would have just been more of the same and felt too long for what it is.

This is an area control/tile placement game where players take turns growing citrus groves (oranges, blood oranges, lemons, limes, and grapefruit) in order to get the most points.

This is a very tightly designed game.  Each round you have one of two actions, build new citrus groves or harvest your groves for money (to buy more groves).  There are very specific rules for where tiles can be placed and there seems to be a lot of strategy to mine here.  I got a big Tigris and Euphrates vibe out of this game, which is one of my favorites so this one really resonated with me.  I especially like that the rules are reasonably accessible.  Deep strategy and accessible rules is an awesome, somewhat rare, combination.

The graphic design, due to the colorful tiles, makes for a pretty pastel picture.  If I had one minor complaint it is that the orange and blood orange tiles are two different shades of orange.  They weren't so close that I couldn't tell the difference between them but it would have been better if they were more different colors.  They could have made the blood orange tiles easily a deep red and all the tiles would be much more distinguishable.

I have yet to play a game from [person=8935][/person] that I didn't enjoy, so I had to give this a try as well. Like most [company=10848][/company] titles it is a well developed family friendly strategy game. And this one has a very classic feel to it. Like those games they made about 10 years ago. I quite enjoyed it, just like enjoy those games from back then. The only knock I have against it, is that it's happy being what it is, not trying anything new, not trying to stand out. And I wish it did try a bit harder, because it now gets lost in a crowd of perfectly fine games that fail to stand out. But it's a fine game that is certainly not a waste of time!

Citrus is a pretty simple game; buy tiles from a shared market and add them immediately to the display. You score for how big your plantation is.

What makes it clever are the little wrinkles; limited numbers of workers mean that you have to manage your purchases and your finances. Having to remove your workers means that there is a timing aspect to scoring fincas.

There's a lot to think about here, but all wrapped up in a neat, 70 minute (or so, it felt fast) package that played very nicely and was enjoyed by all.

This is a tile laying game that is kind of a cross between [thing=822][/thing] and [thing=42][/thing].  You score points by controlling the most tiles around specific locations and you need your workers on the board to control the tiles, but you need to take your workers off the board to get money and buy new tiles.  Fairly clever design that I would recommend if you like tile placement games.

Another fine example of quality and simple but elegant complexity from the Maestro Mr. Allers.   

Buy, plant, and harvest plantations.  It's just that simple, but the strategies are much deeper than that.  Plays great with 2 as well as with more.  The small board is great for 2 players, Although the bigger board really allows for more options to develop as the game "grows".

I really appreciate the option for a long or a short game,   with all the games trying to get to the table this is great.

Excellent game.

Citrus will remind you of many different tile laying games - Carcassonne for one.  It also has some obvious roots in Through the Desert.  But the game it most resembles IMO is Seeland.  

I've played Seeland many times.  I've wanted to really like Seeland, but something was always lacking.  It basically came down to how turns felt repetitive.  You lay tiles, score, rinse, repeat.  Never felt like there was a a bigger picture.  IOW, very tactical.  I don't have a problem with tactical games.  However, I do need such a game to not feel repetitive from turn to turn.

Unfortunately, that's also exactly what I see in Citrus. I do think Citrus is the deeper game and perhaps even the better game.  However, the rules in Citrus are less thematic than Seeland.  For example, in Seeland you get a bonus for surrounding your windmill with different crops. The thematic reason is that crop diversity is good for the soil.  In Citrus you are disallowed from having the same crop from connecting to a finca.  Why?  There's no thematic reason at all.  It's just necessary so as to make the game more playable.  While that's fine, it's annoying, especially for a lighter game such as this.  It makes the game feel very abstract.  And that's not the problem per se.  I love Kingdom Builder, a game extremely abstract compared to Citrus.  But KB is deeper with more strategy.  

It's the combination of factors that detracts from Citrus.  It either needed to be more strategic or less repetitive.  Either one would have fixed the game for me.

I'm reluctantly giving Citrus a 6.  I'd play it, but I don't need to own it.

Very nice simple game like they used to create some years ago: simple yet extremely interesting and somehow original mechanics: you place minions on regions and they score more points if the regions get big, but to buy tiles to enlarge regions you need money and you get money from taking back minions, then scoring less points... great!

Scoring the fincas can get tactical and if you don't have majority you should see if you get atleast second place to score some points.

Balderdash is one of the better "party games" out there. If you have a few drinks in you and you have a group of silly friends, it can be a lot of fun.

The premise is that you are given a word, movie, person, etc; and then you write down a definition or description. For instance, if it's a famous person, you write down what that person is famous for. Then after everyone is down, one person reads all the answers and everyone is required to guess which answer is the real answer.

A lot of the real answers are quite ridiculous sounding, so it can be difficult to tell your friends' answers apart from the real answers if people give clever enough responses.

This is one of my favorite party games because it does have some variety. I can get frustrated with games where you are just doing the same thing over and over again. This one at least has some different categories that have slightly different dynamics.

But it's definitely the type of game that depends on the crowd for the level of entertainment. If you have creative and silly friends, it can be a lot of fun. If not, it could be very boring.

I love this one.  I used to play this as a teen growing up with my family sometimes.  It was regular Balderdash back then, but the game is pretty much the same.  

It's a lot of fun, and some good laughs, especially when you're trying to read some of the absurd definitions people will come up with.

RATING: 5
To my way of thinking it is a curious thing indeed that this game is rated so highly by many of my fellow Geeks.  Indeed, many folks who like this, hate Cranium.  I just don't get that at all.

This game is much slower than Cranium, it's mostly less funny (there are some hilarious moments, but they are less than 20% of the time); the scoring mechanism is ungainly and cumbersome and makes the game drag out further; the actions are pretty samey - make some wordy, possibly pseudo-intellectual and ridiculous answers that sounds vaguely plausible in that they swim in a pond where none of the answers are that; repeat for 40-60 minutes.

Hmm, well, it's ok, but I bought this after hearing the buzz here, and like with Wits and Wagers, I feel I've been mislead.  It may be a well-known party game, but I think it's the slightly intellectual side of it that has appealed to people here.  Alas, the fun side of it doesn't balance that up.  As regards intellectual party games, Cranium Hoopla is VASTLY superior.  For fun, pick several others.

RATING: 6
Great for a silly party. You start to remember the answers after a while though. The real answers are sometimes truly ridiculous! Once, I accidentally made up the 100% correct answer to one of the film questions out of my head when trying to think of the most ridiculous thing that it could be about. (I was just having a laugh) I couldn't believe it was actually true!

A decently playable "family/party" game, as long as all players are of similar level of play.  If one player is unable to write as well as others, they may not enjoy this one at all.  The "movie plot" category is interesting, but the others (names and dates) are of dubious value.  This game is VERY group-dependent.

This game is a timeless classic. It will always be fun and have infinite replay-ability...really! People are always laughing at the ridiculous answers. It takes a lot of cleverness and strategy to get people to vote for your answer. It's a type of strategy a lot of people aren't used to, but it is there, believe me. One con is that you have an advantage if you know the people who you are playing with well. For example, if there are two sisters playing, they probably have an advantage because they know who wrote what.

Balderdash does provide fun, but it tends to devolve into nothingness and is rarely finished. This tendency to devolve can be a good thing or a bad thing for its intended party setting. But, to me, this feels more like an ice-breaker than a game.

One of my absolute favorite party games.  It expands on the Balderdash idea, allowing players with different strengths to shine.  For example, I love creating movie synopses, but always hit a mental block when it comes to the abbreviations.  We always get a lot of laughs. It's bizarre when three or more people come up with the same ideas, and lets us know we've been spending way too much time together.  HA!  [Thrift $1.09]

Definitely adds something by separating the game into categories.  But we still run into the issue of creativity dropping off about halfway through the game.  Also, it often becomes more fun to simply make the other players laugh instead of actually making a strategic guess.  The board is much too long and drags the game out longer than it is fun, so we usually play only halfway up.  Played that way it can be a fun little party game that only takes a half hour to an hour.

Good party game. Some aspects are sloppily designed - the 'double move' space is a bit silly, the scoring track could have been any length but the letters of the alphabet make the game a little too long. Word definitions, movies and acronyms are great, people and dates not so much. Being a history PhD gives me an advantage on the latter!

One of the best party games for the creative bunch. Before each game, I have a difficult time imagining how this game can be as humorous as I remember it being; however, I'm never disappointed.

Unless you have a couple of unthinking types in your group - this game will be a blast.

Pros:
-You get to make ridiculous things up.
-It is often hilarious.
-It is fun to see others' creative side.

Cons:
-Sometimes someone in the group gets writers block and takes a long time to get something down on paper.
-Occasionally you get someone who can't read the answers without giving away which one is or is not the correct answer.

I once played this game with my step-grandfather who was in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease - that was a disaster. Every other game of Balderdash that I have played has been wonderful.

I have the Canadian "Absolute Balderdash" edition.

This is my absolute favorite party game.

I have combined the cards from all of my Balderdash-style games into one game that I call "Ultimate Balderdash", standardizing the guessing rules.  The other rule change is that each game, the players choose five categories from to play during that game.  To win the game, you must score a point (or choose when you're the reader) in every available category.  

I've combined cards from Absolute/Beyond Balderdash, Tabloid Teasers, Wise & Otherwise, Sniglets, Gagline, Famous Last Lines, Liebrary, Ex Libris, Bluffers Beware, Quips & Quotes, Origins, Malarky, Fictionaire, All in the Family, and several others.

Not a game that I want to play frequently, but with the right group of people, and with the creative juices flowing it can be quite fun. We used to play this semi-regularly with some drinks, but it has long since fallen out of favor in favor of more modern designs like Say Anything and Wits & Wagers.

At its best by far when votes are simply popularity contests based on the funniest response, screw the real definition being worth anything, I honestly feel the rules as written distort this game and try to make it competitive which in this case just falls flat with me. Have had some fun sessions, but it never sounds good. This goes double now that the far superior Say Anything has been printed, as that takes the best part of this game: fun, off-the-wall responses, and makes the scoring system work better for groups that want that out of the game.

Good party game that becomes more interesting as the players learn to more closely mimic the style of the real answers. 

The Words, Movies and Initialisms categories are the best. People and Dates are fairly boring since they don't really give the players anything to work with, and the Laws category that replaces Dates in some more recent editions isn't much better. Still, there are about 500 cards, so even if you only use the three good categories, you'll still potentially get 1500 rounds out of the game.

(As titled Absolute Balderdash here in Australia) a great game of improv and creativity. Like other socials of it's kind, game play is highly influenced by the group you're playing with. With the addition of dates, acronyms, etc over the standard word definition, adds more to it.

je stelt een vraag. iedereen schrijft een antwoord op, je mengt de antwoorden met het echte antwoord en leest ze voor. de spelers moeten nu het juiste antwoord vinden. Films (plot verzinnen), data (wat gebeurde op die datum), initialen (waarvoor staan de initialen). de echte antwoorden zijn dikwijls nog meer vergezocht dan de blufantwoorden. 1,5

(As of [b]?[/b] plays) A decent party game whose obscure, off-the-wall trivia inspire a great deal of humour in the participants.

Would like to see how it compares with other, more BGG-friendly party games such as [GAMEID=20100].

I *REALLY* have to be talked into this game, and more importantly *REALLY* have to be playing with the right group. I used to play with my family, but everyone just made up the silliest definitions and had fun laughing as they were being read. That's all and good, but you're not really playing a game anymore. As a game it's bearable, but there are hundreds of games I'd rather play.

RATING: 6.5
The reader absolutely must review all the entries to get the gist of them, and be able to read them fluently and clearly and with the right emphasis (thus understand what they mean) and this must happen QUICKLY.  It's no fun if everyone playing is either too dumb to make a sentence, stone cold diehards, or if one quack-o starts trying to be funny and then people vote for them just because it's stupid.  It's best if everyone's setence is funny while remaining firm possibilities, or if all of them are quality entries and there is perhaps 1 off the wall one that has you keel over.  Otherwise the game SUCKS.

And I've only played Beyond Balderdash which just seems like Balderdash with more topics.

Apparently goes by "Absolute Balderdash" here in Canada. Picked it up at a thrift store while on vacation, only to find out that my wife hates the game because she "sucks at bulls***ing, and besides was one of the games we all had to remember to lose for grandma". 

The rest of the family loves to bulls*** though, so it'll probably get some mileage.

[Party Game, Creative] [6P:6] Nice party game for creative people. Making up answers isn't easy for everyone, and the game may drag if a player or two struggle to come up with answers at the spur of the moment. With the right crowd, it's a pleasing party game that can elicit laugh-out-loud moments. Sometimes, the most absurd answers can be the most plausible...

I have yet to play this game with more than 2 people so my rating may not be valid... But I think it greatly depends on the group you are playing it with.

RATING: 8
The addition of pre-printed cards does wonders for this traditional parlor game.  The "Beyond" version adds some variety.  The acronyms and movie categories are a nice changeup pitch, but the people and date categories are a bore.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Simply put: all players are given a strange word at the beginning of a round and each secretly writes down a definition for that word and gives it to the leader, who then reads aloud all of the responses and the players vote for the definition they believe to be the real one.
That's it. You get points if someone picks your definition, or if you guess the correct one.
To be good at this, you need to be a fantastic, self-absorbed, lying sack of BS, and/or able to write definitions using the terse, to-the-point style of Funk and Wagnalls. (Look it up.) 
It also helps to be a charismatic charlatan when you read the responses and gently persuade the group away from selecting the definition of whomever is currently in the lead.
It's fun, but it takes too long, and with the wrong mix of players, some of your group will be woefully behind in the score before you're half-way through. This means they aren't having fun, and the rest of the night will just be a slog for them while they sit there, feeling inadequate, repeatedly asking for cheese puff refills.
If you want to have fun with a group, and get a laugh out of them, there are so many better games out there. But Balderdash is a safe bet at gatherings of people who would dash for the door if you dared suggest playing an actual "board game," or who are too timid for charades, or who lack basic social skills and/or limbs. 
Hmmmm.
Paraplegic charades.

Beyond Balderdash is a creative bluffing game that is actually pretty fun at its core (the extra categories really are much needed).  This game is definitely more for the merrier and requires a certain type of player, namely party gamer.  The game may have some length issues as it's a little long for what it is and the scoring is a bit of a problem, but it succeeds where it tries and that's enough for me.

Instead of just obscure words that you have to make up bogus definitions for, this includes obscure dates, initials, people, and movie plots.  Fun, but I prefer regular Balderdash.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Make up definitions, what happened on a date, the plot of a movie, or what an acronym stands for.  Still more fun to make things that are funny than try to win the game.

Initial Rating 8.0 (May 2011)

What a surprise. I enjoy Beyond Balderdash a lot. This is a hilarious game you can play with almost anyone as it is very easy to teach. It is not about who has more knowledge, it is about who can bluff better :D. Perhaps it is a bit longer than it should but it is a very good game, one I can see myself playing in the near future.

This is a great party game, reminiscent of Dixit. Still I’m downgrading its rating because I cannot play it as much as I want. 

The language is not a high barrier for most English games we play, but this game is too American for us. Every one of us understands English, but many references are way beyond us (mostly the initials), also the movies` names are differently on our language. I thought this wasn’t going to be a problem, but it bothers me a bit now.

I love that there is always a correct answer, that is, the game is judged objectively, otherwise I would hate the game (as I do with Why did the Chicken). As with most party games, you need the correct game group to enjoy the game.

This is one of the few games I really wish was available in Spanish, however I still feel it is a great game and I would always say yes to a game of Beyond Balderdash.

I still enjoy Beyond Balderdash and I don’t think it will ever leave my game collection, however there are better party games out there so bringing it to the table has been very hard. Also, my own desire to play the game has decreased a bit over time, so I’m downgrading its rating.

Current Rating: 6.5

I’m downgrading Beyond Balderdash rating once more. I have a system to select which game I should play next and Beyond Balderdash name just came up, but as soon as this happened, I realized I don’t really want to play the game again. It remains a solid party game, but my desire to play it again has decreased a lot. I´m selling it ASAP. I would play it again if requested though and I will probably buy it again if it were available in Colombian Spanish.

An ok game. Plays best in "the right group" of people. You get a bunch of people that are willing to get into the moment and have a good time it can be a pretty fun experience. 

Not my favorite party game by any means.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A good party game, but highly dependent on having the right crowd. Some people simply aren't especially good at creating humorous and/or good guesses, in a small amount of time. There's also potential for people to generate inappropriate responses to questions...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I like this game alot, but it increases the problems with the original:  if even one person is less skilled at bluffing or hiding their style it can hurt the experience.
Also, it tends to last longer than the fun by about 30 minutes.

Update - this game is best played just for the points (lose the board) and choosing to play only a couple of categories at a time.  Movies is by far our favorite, followed by acronyms and words.  Dates feel too random, as do names.

Good solid game as long as you are with creative people, or better yet those that don't whine about not being creative.  Whether this version is better than the first, it's a toss up to me.

I was so looking to playing this since I'm a huge fan of the original Balderdash, but sadly, the new categories just don't work the way that I thought they would. I think just having a pure word category makes for a more enjoyable game. Its just not as funny as the original.

Takes a creative group of people to really have a great game.  But when you have the right people all putting a lot of effort into their bluffs, this can be a really fun and entertaining game!

The original Balderdash is better, as it keeps the focus on unusual words, rather than branching out into obscure films or other subjects. Still, with the right crowd, this is a fun and funny game. Fairly right-brained in that it takes some creativity to come up with bogus definitions or descriptions that will fool the other players, but still a real "game" in that there really is a competition to score points and prevent others from scoring, if possible.

Beyond Balderdash is the expanded second edition of Balderdash. Balderdash is based on bluffing your opponents into guessing your false definitions to obscure Words. Beyond Balderdash adds several new categories to the mix: Movies (make up a plot), Dates (say what happened on it), People (say what the person did), and Initials (make up what they stand for). The real answers are often even more outrageous than the bluffs, so the game offers plenty of laughs. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I really liked Balderdash as a kid, but I don't care for it as much anymore.  I think it has to be played with a certain type of people, and then it's hilarious.  Otherwise, it's almost painful.

This game has been a hit with our kids aged 12 and 14, as well as the grandparents. A fun family or party game - not to be taken too seriously. We usually don't even bother scoring.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I love this game, but you HAVE to play it with the right people. If any players aren't clever enough to come up with realistic alternatives, then the game becomes too easy as the number of available options is reduced. With those types of players, the game drops quite a bit. With able players, it ranks highly. This score is basically the average of those two levels.

RATING: 8
Still a favorite mainstream party game, but the "write your own" concept is (as always) dependent on your group. Writers need to be able to approximate the style of language that the game uses (or else the correct answer stands out rather obviously), and the reader must must MUST read all the answers silently to himself first, before reading to the other players, so that all possibilities are read with the same cadence and confidence (else, again, the correct answer stands out).

When played with creative people, this game has me literally crying with laughter. I've seen my dad creased with laughter to the point where he has been on the floor on his hands and knees hitting the ground. I've seen people spit out drinks and nearly wet themselves from laughing so much. The game always seems to "degenerate" into writing funny things, but who cares, it makes it the most mazing fun! Great party game that seems to be expandable far beyond it's recommended maximum number of players.

01/08/2013: This is one of our "classic" party / family games.  We've had this one for a long time in our collection...long before I knew boardgaming was a hobby.  It's a fairly easy game for most to play.  There is a bit of an age factor to it as you must make up definitions and events for words the the majority of people won't recognize.  Some younger players may not be able to wrap their creativity around it in a gamerly enough fashion to score well, but they should still have fun.

This game has consistently been a fantastic laugh with my friends and family. It is especially good when the group loosens up and answers become a little bit sillier and/or risqué. 

A favourite party game to play among the more casual board gamers and larger groups.

RATING: 8.7
Another great solid party game that is a delight to play over and over again. Like several others on my list it relies on the creativity and fun-loving nature of the people playing it rather than cold calculations. This is a fun game and one of the truly smartest out there.

RATING: 5
Dixit has a similar voting mechanic to Balderdash, but Balderdash inverts the creativity aspect. Where Dixit limits the players with the cards in their hands as the only answers to the main player's clue, Balderdash is limited only by the guessing players' imaginations. The lunacy this allows can lead to big laughs. Unfortunately, Balderdash's execution is very clunky and dated, making the duration between laughs long and the game feel lengthy. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

One of the better partygames if measuring how fun it is. Might take too long with bigger crowd. Better to play just one full round with 7-9 players so everyone is once the one to read answers.

Fun game if played on occasion. Like most party games, depends on who's playing. This is best with people who have a facility for the written word plus a sense of humor. So, on one hand, while I don't feel like playing this a whole lot, I also much prefer it to other, more standard fare. My family and I usually play a game that does not last as long as the printed track. Acquired used, in trade, February 2010.

Hilarious! We have not played a game yet where everyone didn't reach a climax of slap-happiness! Great with family and friends! This is a little challenging for younger kids in terms of earning points...maybe not quite fair to them! But, even so they really still have lots of fun!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I love this game!  The B-Movie blurbs are my favorite option.

I like everyone trying to be funny--sometimes just funny or insulting to one of the other players (usually a sibling), and sometimes just the right amount of funny, but maybe, possibly serious enough to be one of the true, goofy answers.  

And the meta-game is great because it can't hurt you.  I tend win a lot in my limited circles, or at least be in the running.  So people will sometimes purposely start choosing the answer they think is not mine.  But then the fun challenge becomes mimicking the other players' types of answers to get guessed anyway.

We rarely finish this one--we usually get about halfway through and enjoy it the whole time when playing with the family.

Funny creative group game! I find this better than the original because of the more catergories. One of my favorites, primarily for the challenging of players to be creative in coming up with a false definition of something and making it sound feasible. Yes, I realize that this seems like it encourages lying, but I think of it as a fun unique exercise of creativity in a way I enjoy. Bonus that it fills an evening with laughter.

Such a simple concept - but tons of fun. This game makes me proud of my friends with the amount of BS they can come up with to either make extremely believable, or utterly ridiculous - either way, making it so difficult to figure the truth from the fiction. A true classic that always results in belly laughs and sometimes tears. Love this simple game - even if the edition available comes with the most useless and ugly game board you've ever seen in your life (spinner included)! A must have regardless!

Being a creative sort of girl in general, I like Balderdash's concept a lot and always have fun coming up with funny and interesting definitions. I've brought this to a lot of parties and had some success with it.

A reasonable party game.  The more, the merrier.  Somewhat of an improvement over Balderdash in that there's more variety, but sharp writing skills will give you an advantage; for example, in the "movie plot" category, it's important to replicate the summary styles used on the cards!

The question is, is this better than regular Balderdash?  I say yes and no.  It is fun that you get all the extra categories.  This keeps the game fresh, yet the movie synopsis category somehow comes up way more than anything else, and can make the game last a really long time.  We usually just play to the halfway point on the scoreboard.  The trick to this game is knowing how to sound like the game, which you learn with time and gives newbies no chance.  Sometimes you just want the word definitions, which you can always just use and make this regular balderdash.  This game has given me endless fun growing up with my crazy brother as we made ridiculous answers that nobody ever picked.

How much fun you have with this game really depends on the crowd you play with. If everyone has a good sense of humour and enjoys thinking creatively then you're guaranteed a great few hours.

RATING: 6
Rather than just fabricating bogus word definitions, this game reaches further than the original Balderdash and asks players to also make up bogus historical events for a given date, plots for a given movie title, Claims to fame for a given name, Or bogus definitions of acronyms.  The variety helps keep the gameplay fresher than Balderdash.

RATING: 6
You need to play with the right mix of people, as writing to bluff is more difficult than it seems. Gets the creative juices flowing, but I can't always take it seriously - I like absurd answers rather than trying to win.

On the downside, the voting is inelegant and awkward compared to, say, Dixit. Nobody seems to remember what the answers were. Overall, the game takes too long.

As a legal-type, I'm annoyed by the "laws" category, almost all of which are fictitious.  When I can't convince my opponents to exclude the category, I tend to use answers like "In Florida, it is illegal to use an elephant to...commit bank fraud."

The acronyms and movie titles add a great deal, though; the "famous" people, somewhat less.

With the right people, early enough so people don't get tired, this game is great.  Inevitably, this game becomes not about winning, but having the most ludicrous answers.

Another of the "standard party game" set.  Lots of fun, IMO, if it's not taken out too often.  They've also apparently rebranded this, because my copy is just called "Balderdash," but it contains all five categories from Beyond Balderdash.

RATING: 5
The appeal of the original is the language aspect.  That is greatly diminshed in the sequel, which to me makes it less enjoyable.  However, it is still fun in its own right.  As my siblings and our spouses have all achieved a fairly uniform level of "creative writing" in this game, it can be a real brain burner trying to determine what to avoid.  But I guess that is not really the purpose of this game.

Beyond Balderdash -- Played once; four-player.  The light-hearted feel of a party game, but for a smaller crowd -- say four or five players.  I expect that any more than six players will lead to too much time spent reading (and re-reading) the definitions aloud.  Ideal for a relatively small group of gamers whose goal is not competition but structured fun.

This game may have caused the greatest laughs out of any game I've ever played. You try to bluff your opponents with your definitions of strange words, plot synopses of obscure films or knowledge of infamous people and dates. The only category I'm not keen on is the acronyms, but that's because I can never think of any good ones. It's a really well put together party game but sometimes it can take a little too long to finish.

[50-100 plays] We learned this from Aunt Nora and Uncle Reed as kids simply by taking turns picking obscure words out of the Dictionary. All other players would write a fictional (sometimes rdiculous) definition while the turn captain also submitted an accurate definition. All entries were read, voted upon, and if no one voted for the correct definition, the turn captain would receive 1 point for every player in the game. Fictional definitions voted upon would get that player 1 point per vote. Played to an agreed upon number of rounds. Very fun, and wow, didn't require the purchase of a board game.

Most recent play was 2003 ?

A family favorite!  Always leaves us in stitches.  Will play anytime with any group.  The only flaw in the game is that the reader can stumble over the hand-written answers that they can't make out. However, I use this as a tactic to throw people off of the real answer (I'll purposely stumble on the nicely typed game answer, as if was a poorly hand-written...heh heh heh). Love this game!

Beyond Balderdash is much better than the original. It brings more variety and creativity to the game, it adds dates, movies, people, and acronyms instead of just word definitions. 

It looks like a trivia game, but it's really a bluffing game for creative thinkers. It's similar to Dixit but with words instead of pictures. It's not for everyone though. Players can easily suffer from writer's block and/or put really lame answers that are obviously ridiculous. 

I enjoy the game sometimes.

The original Balderdash was a better game by a good deal, I think, and as a party game, I rate it much higher than Beyond Balderdash. If you don't have a copy of either, I would recommend playing Fictionary, as described in Bruno Faidutti's Ideal Game Library. This kind of game is truly hilarious with the right group of people - escpecially when 2 or 3 are intoxicated. (I hate saying that, and do not say it to encourage drinking - but mildly intoxicated people do come up with hilarious word definitions.) The original Balderdash is essentially a formalized version of Fictionary.

Beyond Balderdash diminishes the fun, in my opinion, by introducing categories other than word definitions. The three or four times we've played it, it just fell flat when compared to the original.

I think this game has a place in the world, just not in my collection. It is accessible to non-gamers and requires some imagination but is infinitely better than trivial pursuit. I would play this if other non-gamers wanted to. My main criticism, after 1 play, is that it seemed to take a while.

Like Balderdash but in addition to word definitions you can also do initials, dates, people and movie plots. It's an OK game, but there are a LOT better party games out there! It drags on too long and I don't like having to just make up random crap.

This game, along with "Quip It!" and "Why Did The Chicken...?" are among my favourite party games because they allow me to try to be creative and funny.  Something about me just loves the challenge of improvising funny lines on the spot.  Mind you, I don't exactly play this game as it is meant to be played.  Rather, I just attempt to write the funniest answers I can think of, and give my vote to what I think is the funniest of the other players' answers (although every so often it ends up being the correct one).  Thus, this is one of those rare games which, for me, is not about winning and all about having a good laugh.  My version of the game is called "Absolute Balderdash", but it seems to be identical to "Beyond Balderdash".  It takes the original game of "Balderdash", which was all about inventing word definitions, keeps the definitions as one category, but also adds four more fun new categories: People (gives a name and asks what that person was famous for), Initials (gives some initials and asks what they stand for), Movies (gives an obscure movie title and asks you to write a brief plot summary), and Dates (gives a date and asks what significant event happened on that day).  This adds a really nice variety to the game so that you don't get tired of simply trying to come up with definitions of weird words.  Of course, the one thing that can really ruin this game is if at least one of the other players are not at all good at making stuff up on the spot and take forever to come up with an answer, all the while feeling completely stressed and making everyone else feel a little stressed too.  And while the importance of keeping well-hydrated cannot be over-stressed, a long evening of playing this game while consuming several beverages can cause it to quickly turn into Bladderdash.  Game design: 4.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 4.5/5  Total: 9/10

I prefer--and miss--the purity of the original Balderdash.  However, that one is cringe-inducing if some players have less verbal prowess than others.  Beyond Balderdash dilutes this problem by adding other goofball categories, like dates or acronyms, and the result is more accessible.  It's still not for insecure players.

Unlike the original Balderdash, Beyond has only drawback:  The answers don't read like definitions out of a dictionary, but instead read in a very casual style.  That makes it kind of obvious what the real answer is until players can get a feel for how they should phrase their answers.

I recommend reading a couple of cards before playing this game to get a sense of how the answer is being presented so that the player answers blend in.

The category idea:  brilliant!  And puts this version ahead of the original.

Beyond Balderdash (now printed as just Balderdash) is a light and entertaining party game. The active player, the Dasher, choses one of five categories and reads the clue. The other players write their own balderdash answers to the clue, and then as the Dasher, who has written down the correct answer, reads the all clues, take turns voting on which they think is correct. 
The five categories (movies, names, acronyms, dates, and words) provide plenty of variety to cater to different players' strengths, and depending on the age and creativity of the group, fake (or real) answers range from deceptively real-sounding, to laugh out loud hilarious.

I will readily admit that the game has flaws, but this has been the premiere boardgame in my family all through my childhood.  Well, starting with the original Balderdash which I somewhat despised, but still played.   

I have a much easier time with the new categories such as Initials and Movie synopses than with the original word-definition.

It's been years since I've played, so my opinion may lessen if I pull the game out of retirement again.  The game isn't for everyone, almost every game you have people who are perfectly attuned to  BS'ing well, and are well read and run away on the board, while others sit frustrated the whole match, but at the very least you can have fun with ridiculous definitions.

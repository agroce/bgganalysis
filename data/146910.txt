Medium-heavy economic eurogame about drilling oil and transport it to refineries around the world by trains and tankers. Each player controls an oil company and must use his shares of his company as best as he can.

Lots of interesting host/parasitic moves. Only problem is that the open cards selection ends up mudded down to areas where nobody has any interest. The 4 vp reshufle is too expensive, but 2 might be too cheap. 3 is on the verge..
Might also be a game-group related group-thinking problem. We are a bunch of leeches.. ;) Good game.

Easily the most interesting of the Essen games I have played so far. Feels like Splotter doing area majority. The way shares work as a resource feels weird, and I'm not sure I like it, but it's definitely something new. I can't think of a game in which players divest parts of their uniquely owned company as a resource. I'm also not sure I like the way turn order stays the same through the first scoring round in a game of area majority. I could see this going to 8 or even 10 if with repeat play I found that the parts that seem rough are, in fact, well-developed and not just rough edges.

From what I have heard, this had a "Wallace" feel to it, and that worried me a bit, since I am not a huge fan of Martin Wallace.  Screw all of that non-sense, this game is a ton of fun!  If all 4p have played, this can get done in 2 to 2.5 hours easy, so it for sure does not overstay its welcome.  Tons of paths to victory, with a cool theme that felt some what thematic.  Very interested to play more.  Too bad its not widely available in the USA.

April 2015 - first play.  Thematic game that has money and stocks (in which you spend stocks in your company to do things).  Once we got through the rules and got going, the game started to move quickly.  Four hours for four of us.  The balance of the game, gaining your stocks to spend to be able to get oil to the countries to be able to get some end game points and knowing to keep other stocks for those same points is a tough balance.  I made the mistake, I think, of not getting as many barrels out there or really diverifying so I'm doing something on everyone's turns. 

The management of all of this really made the game for me as well as the theme and production.

It's a shared incentive set collection game.  Although the mechanics are simple, how they're put together isn't.  On player's turn, he gets 10 bills (they could just as easily be workers).  He spends some/all of them to build stuff and/or do stuff (each thing costs a different number of bills). Any extra bills carry over to future turns.  After 5 turns there's an intermediate scoring for 1st and 2nd of the different sets.  After 7 turns, there's a final scoring for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd of the different sets.  

Players are building oil rigs which can be converted to barrels of oil and then delivered to refineries.  Once a refinery is full, the oil is automatically placed in the box for that continent.  There's also two different modes of transport, trains and ships, that players can build for moving oil from rigs to refineries.  

So, here's where it gets interesting.  Players start the game with 20 shares in their color.  Whenever they use other players' stuff or leech off of other players' actions, they give those players one or more of their shares.  In addition when players deliver their oil to your refinery, you also have to give them 2 shares (the reason you give them two shares is that when the oil is moved from your refinery to the continent box, you get 4 shares (your choice for colors) for each other player's barrel at your refinery).

So, player's are collecting shares of each player's color.  They are collecting money bills and they are "collecting" their barrels in the different continent boxes.  

So, what's the strategy?  I'm not sure.  There is some negative interaction.  If a player has to give you his shares (e.g., when you deliver barrels to his refinery) and doesn't have enough, he has to take out a loan which gets progressively more expensive to repay (at end game it's 25:10).  However, for the most part, it's about placing your resources where other people are going to use them.  

There are a couple of other niggly bits.  I won with 80+ points but my guess is normally winning score is is the 50s or 60s.  There are wildcatter chits that are periodically auctioned.  Each one is worth 2 points.  Each round, you take a card from a set of 8 face up cards that tells you what half of what continent you can build/act in.  The cards also either give extra money bills, extra shares, 1 - 3 VPs or a special "clear an unfilled factory" one-use power.  If you build a 3rd refinery you get 6 points, a 4th refinery 8 points and a 5th refinery 10 points.  However, they are both expensive to build and require you to maintain a large number of your own shares to pay for when people use your refineries.  And finally, you can at any time, pay for actions by converting 3:1 shares to money bills.  

The niggly things probably make the game more interesting and probably generate strategic separation, but I'm still not convinced.  I enjoyed myself, but I'm not sure how heavy it is.  I am interested enough to want to play more.

I'm a bit conflicted on Wildcatters, as I kind of really like the game, and I kind of don't.

The neat thing is the whole structure of the game, which feels very much like a financial game, but then interestingly takes it and makes it an area majority game.  That might sounds lame to some, but I thought it was kind of neat how I had to balance a tight economy to reach the area majority goals.

The other neat thing is that you care about nearly everything everyone does in the game, since you nearly always are using other peoples' stuff or piggy-backing on their actions.

On the down side, the rules are quite finnicky and often can get a bit muddled (especially when it comes to transporting oil).  It all makes pretty good sense once you have a clear explanation, but it's a bit of work to get to that point.  The game has a pretty long FAQ that helps you get there, but it's frustratingly difficult to understand from the rules.

It's also pretty tough to achieve the listed 2 hour play time.  I would budget 3 hours, and closer to 4 for people who are learning.  I don't mind long games if they're really good, but just a warning to others who get a bit worn out by long games.  I'm not sure I liked this game enough to play it for 3-4 hours a pop, and it definitely affects my rating as I think I would have liked this more as a 2 hour game.

Overall, a neat game if you don't mind investing the effort to figure everything out.  For me, I was slightly disappointed giving the effort it took to iron everything out, but I still like it and would play more now that I went through that effort.

For those of you who have never heard of it, Wildcatters is one of this year’s great dark-horse candidates for best game of the Essen SPIEL fair.  At the very least, Wildcatters will probably prove to be this year's "hidden gem" for me.  I had not heard much about it going in, and preordered only because I wanted the extra wooden trains.  

Outwardly, Wildcatters is an area majority and network-building game about oil drilling.  The game has terrific components, great artwork, and plays extremely smoothly.   It spent nine years in development, and the designers’ passion for the game shows.  In fact, even though I had pre-ordered the game and had already paid, Rolf Sagel, one of the designers insisted on giving me a personal walkthrough of the gameplay and then offered to sign my box lid (he even interrupted his co-designer’s demonstration to get me a second signature.  

My first play of the game was a lot of fun, and I have high hopes for its longevity going forward, though it remains to be seen whether it can elevate from "very good" to "great" with experience. It's certainly my favorite of the (relatively few) games I've tried so far.  

While it isn’t a train game, I think Wildcatters will appeal to the train-game crowd. It has some very interesting incentive-based board play, with a lot of tough tactical decisions.  Basically, you build oil fields in a way that (hopefully) incentivizes other players to pay money to produce and transport your oil. You also build infrastructure on the board to encourage other people to use your infrastructure when transporting their oil. If they use your infrastructure, they pay you shares of their company. The point of all of this production and transportation, though, is to garner majorities (either of oil in each region or of shares of each company or of money). So there are some interesting incentive issues, even without control changing hands. Scoring is ultimately just 13 majority games (first and second place) underneath all the spatial board play and infrastructure-building, however, which may seem like a letdown to some.

In the world of Eurogames, Wildcatters evokes memories of Wolfgang Kramer’s Maharaja and the Ostertag brother’s Kaivai.  In Maharaja, players strategically construct infrastructure both for their own use and for use by other players, all in the service of a series of area majority scorings. The same is true in Wildcatters, although the timing of the scorings doesn’t shift like it does in Maharaja. Kaivai is another design that ultimately proves to be an area majority game, despite a bunch of board play that is interesting in its own right. I also think both Kaivai and Wildcatters encourage a kind of parasitism, where you hope other players will do some of your work for you.  I think if you like both Kaivai and Maharaja, I would be surprised if you didn’t like Wildcatters. I rate both of those games an 8, and I currently rate Wildcatters an 8 as well.  

It was a good game - my favorite of the show - but it is not without its flaws. It is not always easy to track where people stand in their majorities. The regions are easy to see at a glance, but money and shares are hard. There is no way to spend shares in other players' companies once you acquire them, so you end up with pretty large stacks of cards (15-25 by the end).  The shares have the same back, so players who like hidden info in heavy games would likely love to play Wildcatters with closed shares. If you like open info (which seems to be how the game was intended), you may need to work out a convention with your group to make things easy (stacks of 5, etc.). It's a minor hurdle, I think, once your group knows what they are supposed to be doing.  It was also just a bit fiddly component-wise, with little oil barrels that seem prone to rolling everywhere.  

(I will note that I think it is a 4-player only design, although my initial play was with just 3).

Having played half a game I found the rules very finnicky and would definitely have appreciated a better organized rulebook. With that said I do like how the game makes you care about everyone's turn (auction, using each other's stuff, trading stocks) so you are constantly involved, but understanding all of the details was almost too much to take in on a first try for me. 

I'd enjoy it if the game was a bit shorter or offered more insights on how to best start a first game that maybe would be a bit more streamlined.

Very impressed at the production quality. Even if I don't have the energy to sticker all the drilling rigs. Rules, on the other hand, I am not impressed with. Language is not as precise as it could be, there are forward references (leaving you scratching your head until you get to something later), and redundancies. Having played it, I liked it, but the rest of the table did not. It feels like there's something worth exploring there, but not sure if I'll get the chance.

It's been many years since I played this game last, and unfortunately Time has not been kind to my memory. I really would need to play again to see what it was all about.

What I [i]do[/i] remember is feeling quite restrained by various choices in how cards interacted with the rest of the game which may or may not have been Good Things; that said, the designer patiently explained to me and my fellow players that one way out of that trap was to take loans. This was also the message in the second game we played under his tutelage. Still, it came down to design choices I wasn't too enamoured with. Then there were some odd choices in how finances and transport worked out, and the end of it all was that Wildcatters felt like something which with lots of added care and attention might be worthy of the 'Splotter' moniker, but now came woefully short. 

And that is as far as my memory will take me, unfortunately. Perhaps I'm being overly harsh; and yes, of course I will revise the rating if the opportunity presents itself. Perhaps, one day.

This is a good game I bought a few years ago. It is a little complex but has a deep strategy. Had the change to play it with one of the designers (André) and it was no surprise he won. But a very cool game indeed. Lot's of interaction and continues choices between helping each other or making it hard for the other players. You need other players to win, but do they have a hidden agenda? I know they are working on a new game about coffee, can't wait to play their next game.

[b][FirstPlayOn20thMay2014][/b] Wildcatters is a game about pick-up-and-deliver, with area majority thrown in. It has some very neat mechanics especially how shares are exchanged between players. 

On your turn, you perform a number of phases in sequence (quite a number of them), only then it's the next player turn (which he/she repeats the same thing). At first I taught there's going to be a lot of dowtime because of this. It turns out it's not the case at all. Due to certain action, other players get to response. Also with repeated plays, the flow becomes quick so the downtime can be reduced. 

Great game!

RATING: 7.5
Wildcatters is an interesting game and very different from most Euros being published. It is more reminiscent of a classic economic game of years passed.   At heart it is an economic area majority game.  And a very good one at that.  Drill for oil, pump the oil then deliver oil to a refinery.  Once the refinery is full you put your barrels into the area-majority marker region from the region whence it came.  So area majorities on these oil deliveries are all open info.

The game falls down only on the share-majority part of the rules.  The rules don't state it but it is implied that the amount of shares you own is secret. This is far too random and simply benefits any card counters out there.  What the game needs is a counter track to keep track of share ownership by player.  I recommend finding some system of keeping this info public for a purer more satisfying game.

The production quality is great.  And I love the paper that the rule book is printed on.

After one play, this game is a near miss for me. It has so much promise but the simple majority scoring pretty much undoes it for me. On each turn, you choose 1 of 8 public cards on display to use that turn for your actions. That card tells you which region you can take actions in and gives you a small bonus along with it. Everybody starts with 20 shares of their own stock. Just like Brass, you use each other's infrastructure, but here you pay each other with shares of your own stock. And here's where the game makes a fatal turn. 

If I could use the stock I get from other players to buy new stuff or do new stuff that was previously inaccessible to me, I'd find it absolutely fascinating. The game would be about unlocking new actions and creating new possibilities that other players may still not have, but instead all we're doing is collecting sets of stock for 1st-2nd-3rd place payouts. 

Here’s an example after the first turn of the game of how much stock players A-D have:
A: 17 of his own, 6 of C's
B: 20 of his own, 3 of A's
C: 14 of his own
D: 20 of his own

Something like that and even more involved is going to happen on everybody's turn over 7 game turns and you have to keep up with it at least to some degree to get a sense of where you stand in the scoring phase. To make matters even more confusing, certain actions reward players with shares of stock from the bank -- in any denominations they want. So gobs of new stock are coming into the game in addition to all the stuff changing hands. Who has how much of whose stock?

So why not just play with open hands then as far as stock? Well, you could, but I'm still not inspired by the idea of creating profitable infrastructure patterns for the purpose of collecting bigger sets than other players, and I'm not sure that turn order wouldn't just kill things by the last player knowing how many shares he needs and therefore knowing exactly what moves to do/not do -- and turn order is static until the last turn of the game. 

I think the secret shares is intentional for this "fog of war" reason and to speed up play. You don't need people asking each other every turn, "How many shares do you have? And you? And you? ... How many do you have again?" Does keeping track of shares all game sound fun to you? Not so much to me.

Do you like area majority?  Do you like intertwined actions and share majorities?  If so, this game is for you.  Each phase, from exploring for oil to building pumpjacks to shipping oil to refining oil is all with an eye towards end of the game area majorities and share majorities.  Feel free to have the Acquire debate (open vs. closed shares) before you start :)

My rating may rise with future plays, but I don't want to give it an 8 just because I won my first game :-) This was a tough game to learn both in terms of the rules (tough to get used to what costs what and whether you need to pay shares or money) and figuring out what the heck one's strategy should be. Took several turns for me to grok it, but this game falls into the special category (for me) of "complicated but worth it." Gameplay is sort of 1/3 shared networks and 2/3 area/stock majority, but there's a shared/interactive aspect to getting into areas and getting stocks. Echoes of Container in that you're doing stuff partly in the hope that other players will help it pay off, and you're likewise watching and trying to anticipate what they'll do. I love that.

As with Acquire, I think the game would be more interesting, for me at least, with open (face-up) share holdings.

Se puede interactuar en el turno del jugador activo cuando este realizar unas determinadas acción,(una de ellas desencadena una subasta). Además de dinero y puntos directos, tienes la opción de obtener shares tanto de tu color como las de otros jugadores. Al final de la partida se puntúan mayorías

Ojo, no es un juego de gestión de acciones con control sobre empresas

Unique game.
I'm sooo f*cking tired of Feldesque-style Sahara-dry euros that I welcomed Wildcatters with open arms.  It IS a breath of fresh air.  Very clever game, full of interesting and nuanced decisions where nothing is obvious and the gameplay can unfold in a way difficult to predict.  Demanding, nerve-racking game, hard to win, but the satisfaction is great.

If it regularly clocks in 2-2.5h (our first play took 3h 20min) this is an instant winner.

an interesting game that reminds me of a bit of Brass logistics and a bit of Acquire scoring.  There is a heavy dependence on the players to have a combined presence in each area, and to draft off of each other's actions. The gameplay is very interactive, which is refreshing after playing a few many multiplay solitaire Eurogames.  One major flaw is the suggestion to play with closed share ownership. This would be hidden but trackable information that determines a huge amount of points.  If you play with shares open, it's pretty hard to count piles of certificates, and a little tedious to always be asking how many each player has, but if you can get past that technical difficulty I think the game will shine.

Love the period, theme, map, bits, and general artistic production. All of it right up my alley. 

The game itself has one very interesting decision; do I piggy-back off others this turn or take the initiative on mine? Also players are forced to spend stocks or cash (essentially vps) to the bank or to each other to do actions. That's always nice.

However, the card drafting bit feels like a constrained Brass and the arc of the game concludes in a less than thrilling series of area-majority contests. In the end, I wish it had just a few more interesting decisions and/or a more robust conclusion.

Fairly interesting gameplay, but not an economic game in anyway despite the theme. More like an area control game with a couple of twists. The network building part is very light, but the parasitic interaction works well.

However the rulebook is substandard, and there are a few very annoying component issues. The oil barrels are thin wooden cylinders with rolling abilities that make completely unsuitable to be used in large masses like here. There are some color reproduction issues on the printed materials (yellow is way too red). The money is very clumsy, and the share certificates aren't well suited for the endgame (too hard for people to stay up to date on the current share holdings).

I'm of two minds on whether to dock a point off the rating based on these production issues, but in the end decided not to. But that's just because my feeling is that I'd never play this again with out of the box components. (And luckily won't need to try to learn the game from the rulebook ever again).

I like the game, but was not wowed by it. I enjoy heavy economic euros alot, but this one didn't quite live up to my hopes for it. 

I typically don't enjoy when games make you rely on other people to enact a plan, if luring people into working with you feels arbitrary. If two players are alone in an area, and someone new decides to invest in one, then the winner will be at a significant advantage to the loser for no real good reason. The length of the game makes this randomness start to border on chaos.

The Wildcatter chits are hugely important, and you can't always control/ predict when they come out. This created some wonky swings in my game when the player that had the most of them waltzed into two chits because both of the other people in the auction were caught off balance.

All in all a good game despite these gripes, and well worth trying if you like economic euros.

First Impression:  

Really enjoyed exploring this one and highly desire more plays to explore this one more.   Two currencies exist in this game in both cash and stocks.  The interplay of these two create some interesting decisions.  One spends stock to transport oil using other people's trains and ships, also to piggy back on building a pump station if an opponent activates an oil field, and finally gives away stock when opponents "sell" you their oil by sending their oil to your refinery (this can be both helpful and hurtful) - hurtful if you haven't kept enough of a reserve of your own stock to pay your opponents for their oil as you must then take a loan which is often very expensive to repay...particularly late in the game!!!  

There is a fair bit of incentivizing attempted in this game.  The ships and trains allow one to move oil to other continents to fight for oil majorities that are scored twice in the game.  Stocks and money are also scored twice in the game.  Expect the first learning game to take 3-4 hours, but I expect future games to go a bit faster.  

*** As you play, be aware that each area can only be activated a certain number of times as limited by the cards on display.  I think each area is available to be activated a maximum of 6 times (unless people pay the points to constantly clean out the tableau and force discards to be shuffled back into the game).  So, avoid entering a region and investing in it if there are little to no returns available in the future....

Another thing to note is the process for moving oil... ***

Annoying aspects included the fact that South America looks very much like the three white continents (light gray vs white).  Also, there were numerous times we recounted our stock holdings in order to help people make decisions about which stock to claim when oil was refined.  Might try and figure out some sort of convention to help see what everyone has in the future since all info is public.  (wipe board and marker perhaps?)

Turns can feel very limited due to the scarcity of workers and the card row dictating which regions are available for players to perform their actions. The game plays longer than necessary and at times it can be impossible to follow other player's action despite being a shared incentive game.

The economic engine part is very interesting, but the fact that the game is all about majorities (in regions and in shares) destroys my interest in it. To make it even worse, the connection between your actions and the getting those majorities is not intuitive and hard to wrap my head around.

That would be worth a 6 or so, but the extreme fliddliness of the game (need tweezers to move those barrels) and the ridiculous downtime if you're only in one or two regions of the world, make me never want to play it again.

RATING: 6
Solid game with basically two different currencies (money and shares). Thematically the overall oil drilling and processing is well done, the detail mechanics and the shares less so (e.g. why do you pay some stuff in shares and other stuff in money? Why can't you buy shares? Why don't you get money when selling your own petrol? Why are all companies' shares worth the same?).

The mechanics work well enough, although I would have liked to have a way to earn more money (there is a fixed income, with a very small variable part based on a card drafting mechanism). The scoring is a pretty standard majority mechanism (most shares per company, most money, most sold petrol per region ...).

Played once. Fascinating game. Seems you are forced to work together with other players to get enough done, and anticipate their moves if you want to profit from the cooperation. I love that concept, even though I am pretty bad at it.
The scoring is more majority than economic, which sets it apart from other games with a similar feel.

Was invited to play this game with the author. Played a pre-production copy with final rules. Economic game about the oil industry. It covers all the steps: prospecting, winning, transporting, refining, delivering to various continents. Very good game from first time designer. There is a lot going on. Although the mechanisms are not revolutionary, they work very well. Smart economy with shares as the main currency. Logistics are important too, to get your oil to the right refineries. Most points are earned through majorities in the various shares and majorities in oilvessels delivered to the various continents. Recommended this game, a positive surprise for me.

Good Looking Game, Plays Smoothly most of the time. Cool auction and piggy back actions. Run for the Majority and how to get shares of others.
But every turn is on rails (the same over and over again). Also the player order is fixed until last round. And the rulebook has some word and rules issues so that it gets confusing at the first time.
I like the game and would play it again and i see lots of strategies to do, but what you do in your turn is very limited and if another game would give you more flexibility and the rest is the same. It could switch places with this one. But until then i love to see my  wooden pieces (2017 version) more than often on the board from now on.

RATING: 7.4
+ Beautiful looking board and card graphics, games really breathes it's theme
+ Interesting (positive but yet sometimes very confrontational) player interaction which gives the game an original dynamic and makes it stand out.
+ different ways to approach the game
+ game 'builds up' towards the end

- Some randomness. For one there is the chance dat regions do not get developed in which you have invested earlier, which is really painful, as money is extremely tight. More importantly, there is luck in the draw when the region cards are drawn. These cards limit the regions in which actions can be taken. Investing heavily in one particular region can be very powerful when that card comes out often, or it will be your downfall when that region doesn't come out anymore. This is not a very solid mechanism in an otherwise very cleverly developed game in which strategic planning and carefully balancing things of is key. I will have to play the game more often in order to assess whether this mechanic could be used to mitigate luck of the draw. In our second play we used 16 cards: an 'active' row and a 'future' row (like in power plant cards in power grid). This seemed to significantly improve the situation...

- playcards have real nice graphics, but they are printed on super thin card paper, maybe to reduce weight or cost?

- one gameturn of a certain player can take a long time, causing some downtime. However, opponents will usually also play a role in other players turns when searching for or transporting oil. Overall the game takes a little too long in my opinion.

- majority game in cards? This is really unhandy: players must count their share cards regularly and let each other know how many they have. It would have been better to track the number of shares of each player on a track-board or something...

Approx gametime: +- 45 - 50 min / player

2nd edition: This is not a stock-holding game.  You want to get shares of the other players to buy up consolidation chips, but you just get those naturally in the process of loading and unloading oil from refineries and opponents using your trains/tankers.  You are constantly in need of more of your own shares, which is the way you pay other players. Money, which you use for all your construction and driving drilling/transport, always goes to the bank and is very tight (you basically have 80 for the game + 0-14 or so that you will glean from taking cards).  It feels a lot like Brass to me, but with a bit more direct player interaction in the trading shares and vying for area majority.

Wildcatters reminds me of some old simple games I used to play when I was a child but in a complex way, with the same building up and money management feeling. It has some characteristics, such has the downtime between turns, that may hurt the experience a bit and probably won't work for some players or even for me all the time. But it has its virtues, specially some of the intricate strategies along the play and the above stated hardcore 80's gaming feeling, for sure.

It's one of those games that could be more elegant and properly developed in all its forms but this rudeness inherent to it makes me travel back in time and learn again why I love boardgames this much.

I've played it twice so far, both times with 4 players, and have seen different approaches to the game in both occasions too. And the final scoring was tight and with the feeling that a perfect move in one previous turn would completely bring a different overcome to the endgame. Players feel that, unless having to deal with loans, there is a strong possibility in winning the game as there are lots of changing positions on what scoring has to offer: money, shares, wildcatters, buildings or influence majority.

One of the good surprises from Essen 13 and a good game to play from time to time, if one doesn't have problems dealing with downtime and bad play penalization (loans).

tl;dr: good, rather heavy

This is quite a heavy economic euro and some actions need you to go through them a couple of times before you can remember all the steps to take and what happens when. This makes it quite hard to explain and as a result it has quite a big learning curve.
But that's OK as long as the game is good and engaging. And it is! You need to keep a lot of moving parts in mind with every move and you need to think ahead to be successful.
I think it's quite interesting that managing your own shares as a sort of money is a tricky thing all by itself. In most games you receive and sell shares that have a changing value. None of that in this game. Shares are something for you to pay for stuff but it also plays a smaller role during scoring.
Another interesting part is that you can monopolize an area and do everything for free, but the up front cost is very high. You can also work in the same area as other players and piggy back on their actions. So you're competing and working together at the same time, but this does not feel like a co-op at all!
Our first game took almost four hours, and that's quite long, but all of us were engaged all the time and it was very enjoyable. I can see this speeding up significantly on our next plays.
All in all I'm very happy I got a copy.

One play. Need to read some reviews/strategy. While all the individual actions are clear enough, the effects seem odd, somehow. Paying stock instead of money to transport or refine oil just feels wrong--anti-thematic.

What VPs are available where is unclear in overview. Wildcatters has both literal perfect-knowledge area control and figurative (stock and money) imperfect-knowledge "area" control, as well as wildcatter and refinery bonus points. It's unclear how these balance; probably no fault of the game.

I knew even before we got started that this is a game I would suck at. The whole dual currency is something I have a hard time wrapping my head around plus what's even more more important: the decisions you have to take are subtly nuanced. Go for a too widespread strategy: Wrong! Bring refineries to the board too early: Wrong! Miss the point when it's right to bring further refinieries to the board to offer your opponents space to deliver their barrels to: Wrong! There's a lot of room for suboptimal moves and few chances to do things right. I strongly dislike the mechanic of swapping the cards for 4 victory points. This is way too harsh, when you don't see anything you need (which is quite likely during the last rounds) and are forced to swap vs.someone who gets the exact right card with the one card being drawn from the draw deck tow or three consecutive rounds. 
On the plus side: This game looks stunningly elegant and beautiful during gameplay. Achieved by the colouring and the illustrations of the map and the game components.  

On a sidenote I have to mention the rulebook. I appreciate the effort of including a german translation but if you decide to include it, see to it that you get it well done. No one wants a rulebook medium. See to it that all translations are identically structured and see to it that it is not missing several important points/rules. My advice to native-speaking Germans: Since the german translation is faulty skip the crossreading and go for the english ruleset right away. It'll save you some trouble and the rules will be much, much clearer.

Interesting pick-up-and-deliver, shares and area majority game. Gameplay feels a lot like Container-lite (although this is longer and possibly even more opaque) with value chain construction/exploitation and a significant dose of randomness.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I can see this being a hit among people who like deeper economic games, like maybe Container or Age of Steam or the like.  It's not quite as unforgiving as those games are, but if you put yourself in a position to have to take a loan without a means to pay them back, you're going to lose a bunch of points.  It's risky, with a higher payback rate on the loans the longer you wait to take the loan.  Since you won't find how stock-poor you are in the game until near the end of the game, though, it would be easy to get stuck in a very unforgiving situation.  We didn't play that aggressive of a game, so we didn't see it happen, but we did see a situation where it could have destroyed a player's chance.

The rules are troublesome, and really require that you print out the FAQ and the "What Do I Do to Get..." file to help learn some of the concepts in the game.  There's a lot of ambiguity in the official rules, which led to us playing the game incorrectly for much of our first game.  Luckily, there's enough here that's intriguing enough to keep us interested despite the mistakes we made, which is good, since I want to play again.

I'm not entirely sure how I feel about the region cards.  I understand that they add to the replayability of the game, but it seems like so much of the game is tied in to being able to do what you need to do in a certain region, and there's no guarantee you'll get what you need on your turn.  Also, with the cards as they are, you're only going to be able to use a region four times, not counting the dark-backed cards (which you will only barely touch if no one refreshes the card row).  Four points seems like a big price to flush the cards, but maybe I just don't have enough experience with the game to really see it.

I'm also not convinced that there are enough different strategies to pursue to be competitive.  Having the most money won't win you the game, and having the most stocks in the companies won't, either.  Having the most in the regions [i]might[/i] get you enough points, but I'm not sure that the game allows enough time for you to pursue that as an exclusive strategy.  The game requires you to do well in all aspects, which means everyone is playing the same game.

Wildcatters is a tough nut to crack.  I wonder if I have the patience to crack it.

Oil tycoons position themselves to become the dominant global producer of black gold. Strategic euro on a world map game board combining several mechanics; stock holding, area control, networking, and pick-up & deliver. Card driven oil development areas adds a small random element. This game does a great job incorporating the option to pay for the use of competitor infrastructure and facilities, and shared resource development for lower cost. Those darn oil barrels are fiddly. Why do game makers continue to use round wood pieces? Very interactive strategy decisions.

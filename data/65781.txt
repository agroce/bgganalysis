Feels Race for the Galaxy-ish, but with less of a luck component (a good thing).  As expected from Martin, there are interesting economic elements to be had, such as poverty cube management and balancing when to run the city and when to add more building stacks.  Choosing which cards to play and which cards to put on the display (where your opponents can get them) can be tense!

I really like this game. It has a fun card drafting mechanic for managing your cities that I enjoyed. 
I also like how you never know for sure how far ahead or behind you are. In the games I have played you may think you are behind but end up winning by a landslide, or the opposite can happen. But it is not random, it really depends on how you run your city and how efficient you can be.

I do not know what to think of this one. I really enjoyed it, but I rarely find myself in a situation where I want to pull it off the shelf. I will give this one some time.

Update: The solo variants for this pumped some new life into this. It's very good with three, two, or one. I didn't really care for it with four. This is a great game though.

Based on just one three player game but I know a game that I like when I see it. Really enjoyable and pleasant game with enough to think about and the rules are very straightforward. Looking forward to playing this a lot more.

Update - played this a few times now and it's very good indeed - although very unforgiving if you make a mistake. The range of strategies is impressive. My only concern is that you can feel hosed if forced to take the last card in the deck without being able to activate your city, although I guess more experience allows players to see this coming. A harsh lesson for learners however.

Okay, a quick final update and this gets better each time I play it. Played 2 players recently and really enjoyed it - different strategies, finely balanced, wonderful story etc. I'm on the verge of rating this a 10...

London didn't hit the mark for me. I cannot say that it missed the goal completely but it's just nowhere near the level I would require from a boardgame for it to find its way into my shelf. So London isn't a bad game, only so-so.

The reason for this was in the cards. It just doesn't make sense to me why to have two identical cards when for the other one you have to fulfill a prerequisite for using. That just makes the worse cards useless.

I also found the I'll slap your face cards totally artificial. To me, they look like a blatant attemp to introduce interaction to the the game.

Surprisingly for an eurogame the theme was maybe a little more present than what's usual.

I quite like it, it is practically multiplayer solitaire and the strategy always seems the same, get boroughs, fill up your hand, play them all out, run city, buy boroughs, fill up on cards, rinse and repeat. If played quick enough it works okay but not really much left in the system to uncover.

[2-4] Tried once with 2p and loved it. At first it seems fairly rigid but it quickly comes together. The overall production is quite beautiful and my wife happens to really enjoy it as well. So, my Martin Wallace purchase was a success! I've exchanged the original plastic money pieces for 1-pence and 5-pence pieces and it adds quite a bit to the game. Really looking forward t exploring the card dynamics further...

+ Greatly difficult choices on how to spend your actions and which cards to use versus which ones to use as currency.
- The different strategies are a bit hard to see and balance.


Why it's previously-owned:
Rather than getting a feeling of accomplishment as you build your engine, I felt continually let-down by the fact that most cards were single use; as soon as I got excited, they were gone.
This was traded for the very difficult to find first-edition printing of Morels.

I like this one!  It's all about building your engine (city) and running it better than anyone else, but it works.  It just works.  It's pretty much boiled down and the theme is rather loose, but the game works for what it does.  And I like that.  A lot.

A strange game.  I gather there's some suspicion about the balance between the card play and the purchase of board regions, which is a shame because the card side of things has its original features (the city running) that deserve development.  It's one of those games that at best is satisfying rather than positively pleasurable.

"No, Sir, when a man is tired of London, he is tired of life; for there is in London all that life can afford."  (Samuel Johnson)

London the game is a heavy card game, with economic and area-control elements.  It's a pretty great game, and my only concern is long-term legs (less variability here than in, say, Jambo).

Good points:  the theme shines through.  The graphics are subtle but nice, and the card names and functions combine with the overall mechanisms to really evoke London's history if you like that kind of thing (I do).  Want a capitalist dystopia, Dickens-nightmare of workhouses and poverty but lots and lots of cash?  Can do.  You can educate the poor if you want, though, and elevate the ton of your city (or City).  The south bank is different from the North.  The underground matters, etc.

The second nice thing (though this ties in to the bookkeeping problem) is that YOU GET TO RUN YOUR CARDS.  Most "build stuff" card games I've played end about when an engine runs.  This game starts you out with no money, lots of poverty, and little going on; by the end, you can churn our massive VPs or cube reductions or money-making or underground building, and feel like you really did something.  In that it's like a more controlled Glory to Rome.

Genial! I'm not a expert of card games, but I really enjoyed this one. The building deck system works great, the poverty point track is very important and affects your moves. The last 3-4 turns are decisive and may change the odds of the game. Highly recommended. Wallace did a great job!

RATING: 5.5
First off, I'm not a fan of card games, and London is most definitely a card game!
Secondly, London is commonly criticized as being multi-player solitaire, and a "rinse-and-repeat" game. It's not, on either account. In fact (on the first charge), it's downright cutthroat at times!
The artwork and general quality of the cards is fabulous: it almost makes me wish I liked card games! The board, however, is fairly drab, like in Mr. Wallace's "Princes of the Renaissance". But London, you're no Princes of the Renaissance.
I was foolishly expecting a sort of London-civ building game, and it's not at all a civ game. It's a card game, pure and simple. While the theming of the cards is sound, it just doesn't feel like you're building up London over the centuries.
I had read somewhere that the hand management was kind of an afterthought on Mr. Wallace's part, and that he had originally intended London as a tile laying game. I would have MUCH preferred it that way, without the excessive fiddliness of hand management that we get in this incarnation. 
And now, I must wait for someone (perhaps even Mr. Wallace himself) to come up with a true London civ building game for me. London was not an unmitigated disaster for me, but it was a considerable disappointment.

Excellent abstract tableau builder, that lends more than a little thematic rational to the actions you're achieving (e.g. using a pauper card to pay for the placement of a Blue monument by "sending them to school" -- i.e. using the ability of the school card to alter the rule that normally prevents paupers from being used in such a manner).

Wonderful balancing acts are demanded by the poverty mechanic -- before play I wasn't aware how much of the game hinged on the application of this. Demands the 'Ben-Luca' variant to play well with 2, but a quick search on the Geek will illuminate you on those particulars. 

Note, only 2 games under my belt, both at the 2 player count. Excellent experience, despite being destroyed in both games by my partner. :) 

Only negatives are the components: they're a bit cheap. We quickly replaced the money included, and I'd love to find wooden replacements for the building tiles.

RATING: 8
Another great wallace, though not as great as Brass. There is real tension in how big to make your tableau and when to buy up boroughs, but the latter is pretty much it for player interaction (there is some interplay with what you play/discard to the market, but there is a lot of parity in the cards so it never felt that meaningful). It's the lack of interaction that I think means I don't need to own this one, though I certainly enjoyed my play.

RATING: 3
2-4(3)

2p variant (Ben-Luca, recommended by UnknownParkerBrother). I'm not sure about this quite yet. There are plenty of interesting cards here, and there are several interesting dynamics to manage. You've got to handle your poverty, build up an engine (both pounds and VP), get boroughs and underground tokens, and try not to leave juicy cards out for your opponent.

It plays reasonably fast, with a card draw and a single action on a turn (sometimes we forget the card draw, and sometimes we forget we are limited to a single action on a turn) and the mechanisms are pretty well integrated. Well, I don't know, it still felt long for what it was (even with the neutral player speeding things along) and was thematically thin. Innovation "feels" thematic (even if it's just cardplay and the components don't convey a civ feel), RftG feels "sort of" thematic, but this somehow doesn't.

Also, turns feel sort of forced in that you almost know what you "ought" to do. Gee, I guess I better get a borough. I've got lots of cards so I guess I have to build. I just built all these cards, time to activate. Sure, this happens with RftG, San Juan, Innovation, etc. but ... well ... let's give it some more goes, shall we?

RATING: 6
Comparisons to Race for the Galaxy are almost inevitable, since this is Martin Wallace's take on the build a tableau, pay for cards with cards game.  So, imagine a game like RftG in which turns are consecutive rather than simultaneous.  Imagine the down time with four players. Now imagine a game like RftG in which the card effects are much blander; they all make money, earn vps, get rid of poverty cubes or some combination of the three.  

In London, the game lies in balancing your needs for money and vps, while minimising your poverty.  That's actually more subtle and interesting than it sounds.  Blind card draws and the rate at which the deck runs out add a degree of uncertainty. As with RftG there is little player interaction.  It mostly amounts to taking care not to discard cards of high value to others, although there are one or two mild take that effects as well. 

Overall, there is some interest in the game, but for me it feels a bit over-extended; compare a 90 minute stroll through London to the 30 minute warp speed of RftG.

Production quality is decent, although the cards are a bit thin.  The artwork is pleasing.

I am a big Wallace fan but I feel this game misses the mark. There are a lot of different cards that have abilities and rewards attached, but there just aren't enough varied card mechanics to justify the length, and the interesting theme can't carry it enough. I feel like Race for the Galaxy pretty much accomplishes everything this game wants to, and in much less time per game.

Found the rules pretty bearable.  Presentation, blah.  Card rulings were pretty clear from the appendix, but I found it maddening that many of them looked like they could have simply been printed on the card.  Relatively enjoy the look and feel, and think it's pretty accessible.  Would never want to play with 4P again, due to virtually non-existent player interaction and downtime.  Enjoyed it with 2P, might enjoy it with 3P with fast players.  Think the game system is fun, but overall I consider the game to be too tactical in nature and a bit too long.  Probably one of my favorite Wallace titles, though.  Have kind of a soft spot for it.  Hope for a PBW version.

RATING: 6
+ An ok exercise on cardgames by Wallace. The theme and the mechanics are somewhat interesting.
- It doesn't allow many strategies, the options provided by the cards are extremely limited and the number of choices each turn is also too small for my taste. Sold it, and bought Race for the Galaxy. I prefer London's theme, but RftG offers a lot more of "game". It's a shame Wallace is now focusing on light family games. There are already plenty of designers focused on creating mediocre games.

PS- And what's the deal with mentioning this game's economics? Economics, really?

This is a solid title from Wallace and a nice return to a meaty-feeling mid-tier game.  Its very approachable, not to hard to follow the actions and yet rewarding in play.  Has a feel in weight of Liberte, but with a little less plotting.  Still, there is plenty of planning and good play will be rewarded.  Balancing Paupers and Loans is key and to maximize those - you have to choose carefully and perhaps remember to be a bit patient at times.  Solid showing in design.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Nice card game about the city of London. The game is  squeezed into its mechanics, which make it feel like some kind of bastard child of Race for the Galaxy and similar games - there's some added currency and anti-VPs (poverty points), and most of the cards are one use only, along with some more twists, but it's essentially pay cards to play cards to run an engine. 

But while these mechanics make the theme feel pasted, what gives true flavour to the game are the different cards, which are quite evocative of the city. The boroughs you buy are also a nice addition.

Typically for these card engine games, it plays pretty fast and usually with little downtime, providing lots of variability because of all the different cards. All in all, a pretty nice game, though the end can feel a bit abrupt - the cards you'd prize most for the rest of the game then become essentially useless, and you might not even have the time to run your city one last time.

A nice advantage is that it plays pretty well with two: it's less tight (particularly in terms of buying boroughs), but it also flows faster with less downtime.

Update after 2nd play (again 2-player).  Much the same feelings as before, but definitely the game is too long for me.  It would be crippling with 4 players.


Only one play (2 player) so far.  Hard to form an opinion at this stage.  There are so many options, it is somewhat bewildering.  AP players could grind to a halt on this one!  Beautiful artwork on the cards.  High replay value.  Obviously some "luck" on which cards you draw,  but there are so many I doubt there is a killer combo.  Excellent,  but I will reserve some judgement about a 4-player game - it may be a little long.

+ Really good card game with a growth engine. You need to balance point, money and keep poverty low.
+ You get cards, build them and activate them, earning you points, money and poverty but then you need to start all over again because the activated cards are lost. 
+ An asset of the game is the three stacks of cards, the cards get better as you progress through the stack.
+ As always with a Martin Wallace game, the theme of building London is fairly integrated.

- You really need to play London a couple of times to get to know the mechanics and appreciate the game.

I'm really enjoying this game. Probably the most intuitive Wallace games to play/teach but has a significant amount of depth, replayability and several paths to victory (I've seen wins with as few as 5 piles and as many as 13). The card "cogs" work well together and give the players a sense of accomplishment and a certain thrill when a combo comes together.

Ez nagyon jó! Amolyan táblás kártyajátéknak mondanám. Vagy kártyákat szerzel, vagy leteszed őket, vagy aktiválod. Van egy logikus üteme a játéknak, arra vagyunk ösztönözve, hogy váltogatva hajtsuk végre az akciókat. Ha túl sok kártyánk van, nem érdemes többet szerezni (maximálva van), ha túl sok van kijátszva, érdemes aktiválni, stb. Nagyon ügyes húzás a szegénységi korlát, ami ráerősít arra, hogy nehéz legyen megtalálni az egyensúlyt. Hiába olvastam a játék előtt több embertől is, hogy a pénz a végére elfogyhat, mégis így jártam én is. És tök utolsó lettem. Ötletes játék, az első Wallace, amit volt szerencsém kipróbálni, állítólag nem annyira jellemző rá ez a játék, de ezzel együtt kíváncsivá tett, milyen lehet a többi játéka:)
Szép, kicsit nyelvfüggő, átmenet a könnyedebb és a komoly között. Interakció nem igazán van benne. Nem túl hosszú (másfél óra). Még játszanék vele!

Gyanús, hogy van benne nyerő (vagy nevezzük inkább túl dominánsnak) stratégia, ha ez beigazolódik, az nagy kár érte, mert amúgy jó játék.

A magnificient, more compatible, less weird, but all Wallace game, with artwork this time :) and Wallace classic balance, with beautiful mechanics that tie in with the theme. Draft, combos, tight decisions- all in just above 1 hour. The game deserves a 10 and it will never fall. Cards are slightly different in print but tremendously so in play. At least 3-4 plays needed to appreciate and grasp the game. I was lucky to get it with the first one. 

Wallace owed himself such a game. It deserves top 30 rank definetely. Congratulations sir! 



edit: Out of curiosity I've read the comments of some users that rated this game low, and I agree with most of their observations. However I find these observations good rather than bad. A matter of taste obviously. I like Race for the Galaxy and the vp machine you can create by utilising cards. Race is my 2nd best game after Through the ages. London is the 5th best game I've played.

Basically a card game with a minor board component.  Using cards to pay for buildings isn't anything new, but it works really well for this game.  It seems to me one of the keys to win is to not be afraid of poverty.

London is a very strange beast: it's both so Wallacy and so atypical for Wallace! It's undeniably very different from any other Wallace game...
It's essentially a hand management game, where you want at the same time more cards and less cards. There are many meaningful decisions, a tight economy and several different ways to score points.
The rules are quite easy to grasp (compared to other titles from the same author), the game is short enough, and it has great potential for replayability.

Update march 11, 2011: it finally hit the table with 3 players. It is undeniably a multiplayer solitaire, but the different paths for victory points and the agonizing decisions make London a true gem! Vote raised to 8. Looking forward to playing it with 4!

Update november 9, 2012: the loan strategy seems very predominant, especially with w-players. Vote downgraded to 7.

Our first 4 player game took around 3h and I lost terribly by piling up on "misery" tokens (tried the no-loan strategy) early on that I couldn't get rid of until the end (-37 points there!). 

After that lesson learned, I got the feeling that the first part seems very scripted before it takes off (get loans & buy boroughs). I will have to see how it is next time although my excitement is lowered quite a bit.

First Play: For once a clear concise rule book from Mr W. 3 1st timers skimmed through the rules and launched in. We had the basics but the depth and strategy took a while to creep up on us. 

A game where scores will improve once the flow of the cards is appreciated and anticipated, there would appear multiple paths to victory.

For those who like theme this is dripping in it. All in an excellent game that looks like it may grow into an awesome game. The SE has superbe wooden buildings. 

Second Play: 4 players. Yes this one is as solid as a rock. Lovely game

Wow! This might be my new favorite Wallace game. It has depth, but the rules are easy to understand and the game is fast and fun. It has your usual loans and things to torment you during the game, but this is mostly a card game. My only small critique of this game is the board play. It almost seems like an extra add on and is good for getting some points, but it seems detached from the rest of the game. 

I can't wait to buy this one.

One of my all time favorites. This game is fantastic. I love games where you get to "run your engine". You know, where you (usually) get a tableau of cards that do all sorts of awesome stuff and you can choose to do them all as your turn. London does exactly this. Of course, it is a Martin Wallace game, so there is going to be some suffering as well. Poverty is given out for numerous things, including how many stacks of cards your borough has. There are cards that get rid of Poverty as well. The new version without the board does not intrigue me at all. I think the board adds a nice tactical element that the new edition is missing. The game also scales really well.

TN Game Days play, we had a teacher on hand and the pace was slow for our first game. This one started out thick and abstract, but came together for me while the first few players went. The elegance and multifaceted design that Martin Wallace has here needs to be seen first hand. The game progressed in weight of achievement, while not bogging down. and like all great games should, it teaches you something while it entertains. I will not soon forget my stay in London Town, and its surrounding boroughs, the many decisions of  each draw, each turn. Paying particular attention to my little corner of the world while only occasionally looking out at the greater good. The fancy shops, and new services that one can bring to a town, while balancing out the need to address poverty, is in itself a very fluid, dynamic, artful game, and should be played by any who seek excellence be set in front of them, both in task, and execution bravo!

Another min-maxer's accounting problem. Roll through the Ages meets Le Havre. Buy land tracts when you can. Never build unless you have a handful of cards. If you're gonna borrow, you may as well borrow 40 so you're never short of cash. When running your city, have a plan for ridding cards from your hand—or simply be empty or short when you do. You win again!!!

A good and meaty but slow game that has some (small) similarities with Race for the Galaxy and Uruk: Weige der Zivilisation.  There is a lot of angst on each turn/decision because unlike RftG, most of the cards are good (i.e. few are crappy and easy to discard as "money" to build other cards) and you constantly have to put cards out for other players to see/pick up from.  The fact that you only really have one action per turn means the game is slow to develop and you need to play once to understand the flow of the game.  To me, this game feels more like a more complicated version of Uruk: Weige der Zivilisation rather than a sibling of RftG.

UPDATE 2014: I always seem to lose, but I like the game because it's so difficult to decide which cards to use as "payment" to build your buildings.  The fact that your payment cards become available for opponents to take and build is a simple concept but makes the choices tricky in a good way.  The luck of the card draws can be a turn-off when you need a specific color, but you can mitigate this to a certain extent if you play "toward" the card colors visible in the face-up tableau (many of which are opponents' discarded cards).

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Another strong Wallace game, this one sees players developing part of the city of London by playing cards in front of them or by buying regions on the map. There's a "loss cube" Automobile element called poverty which can be removed with certain cards and incurred by utilising cards in the players city (cards in front of them). You have to use city cards to get money and so on, so you have to use the city. The poverty aspect is somewhat countered by buying regions, so the mechanisms link together neatly. 

We didn't muster a complete idea of strategy on the first play, but it seems that buying regions of the map is good and too many poverty cubes is bad!

Martin Wallace does hand management. It's the typical feeling many Wallace games give: Strapped for cash, needing loans to invest or get out of trouble, hoping that all your efforts eventually pay out. I like it how clever combining and timing gives you an edge over your opponents. There's a bit of luck involved when cards become available. But the game already balances this a bit by having three separate card stacks. Great, game and less dry than some of Wallace's other classics.

NB. Bought the [thing=236191]second edition[/thing] and this makes a great game even better.

RATING: 9
Another Martin Wallace brain-burner - this time with more cards and less tiles. Patented interaction between loans, misery (make that poverty now), income and victory points. It is a hybrid combination of board game and a tableau building card game (reminiscent of San Juan or Race for the Galaxy). As such there is hand management, tableau building and board position to be aware of. In the end it comes down to the construction of the most efficient victory point engine. Already we are seeing folks claiming to have found the "yellow brick road." That happened with Brass didn't it? We'll see...

Trust Martin to take by now familiar elements and twist them into something unique. I had it ordered before I was able to play it and breathed a considerable sigh of relief when the game play proved quite engaging. I'm hoping the playing time will come down considerably with experience, as I expect this to fit into the the category of "challenging filler."

Rating (8) is preliminary based on a single play (four players).
++++++
A couple more plays in and the game is impressing us. I was particularly pleased to find that it makes a fine two player game. There can be a bit of a scripted feel at certain stages but it is too early for me to conclude anything from that yet since it may just be group think at work as we all learn together. Great fun so far - thanks again Martin!

Rating is up to 9!

RATING: 4
Provisional rating after 1 play. Not my sort of game - multiplayer solo, but with downtime (unlike say San Juan or RftG). Not sure why there are 2 currencies for cards in the game - you need to ditch a matching card to play a card (so cards are currency) but some cards also need cash to play too.

Overall, too long, largely unnecessary board (boroughs could have been cards), lack of interaction and the theme is paper thin - many of the cards feel the same even if they are named different (pitch a card, gain 6 cash 1 vp, or pitch a card gain 2 cash and 2 vp) ... just got bored and wanted it to end (and I won ...)

Rating might change if I play again, but in no rush to do so.

Another Hit from Wallace here.
For Wallace a suprisingly very clean, streamlined and unfiddly design. 
Yes, the core of the game is a tactical multiplayer soltaire, but with some nice and enough elements of interaction. There are some dircet cards interaction to tame your oppositon, but the chance or threat to use the dicards of another player and the poverty mechanism are the spice in this game. 
Also is the London building theme well implemented.
Here some beginner tips:
Don`t lose sight of your or the others poverty! The penalty can be easily 30 pts (vs 20 to 60 pluspoints)
Keep your handsize down if you activate cards and to the end of the game.
Without boroughs it will be the hard way.
Don`t be afraid to use some loans.

The turn options- buying land, playing cards, and running your city have a great interaction.  First few plays, it seemed like land grab was a dominant strategy but the truth is you need balance to be really successful.  The poverty mechanic is really well done.  The game clicks along very pleasantly.  Some tough decisions and very satisfying to play overall.  The mechanics and cards do make a lot of sense thematically.  Art and style and theme may seem dry to some but I find them strangely appealing.

RATING: 6
The game is heavier than San Juan, one of our favorites, but seems to offer choices for scoring, in addition to the negative score for poverty. It also has a flavor of Glen More (take the cards you want), but is its own game system. I don't know all the cards, but buying land is the seemingly key to victory, which limits the strategic options. Building in the city and poverty points are a consideration, but the card placement, for activation with a mind, should result in income to buy land in the city, which seems to be the key for the ultimate victory. Decent card/board game that has a one-dimensional approach to victory.

I was a bit wary of London after Wallace's latest games and some of the comments posted here on BGG. Those worries were dismissed after playing a 3-player game, which apparently is the sweet spot. Hand management and control of the develop/produce/buy cycle remind me of Race for the Galaxy, and the poverty mechanic is interesting. Knowing the cards in the deck will probably help enjoy the game even more.

Wallace comes up with a very clever card game.

The innovative play made the game quite dynamic. Really like the poverty mechanism in "running the city". 

The rule book is clearly written, the game is non-fiddly, and there aren't pages of rule exceptions. You'd never know it's a Wallace.

One potential concern is the end game. No one wants to end it and get stuck with a handful of cards. That particular end game mechanic is quite punishing and prolongs the game unnecessarily. Whoever ends the game can also potentially be a kingmaker. This one aspect prevents this game from being a great game.

The board and the bits are minimal accessaries. Paying 40 euros for a deck of 110 cards is a bit steep.

Our group concluded unanimously that it's simply not a game that holds our interest. I think it is being traded away and likely won't be played by our group again.

Perhaps we have been spoiled recently by well designed games like Navagador, Dominant Species, and Seven Wonders, but London feels flat and uninteresting to me. It is on completely the opposite end of the scale of brilliance that Age of Steam was (Age of Boroughs?).

Personal thoughts: I feel that the borough design (cost, incentives, card discard mechanic) is poorly thought out. Even if players are buying boroughs moderately to heavily (as the game mechanics reward), you have rounds of players picking up cards, throwing out cards, moving cards to discard piles, for the first part of the game. Yawn.

The game suffers from a sameness amongst far too many cards, where the decision of whether to play card A or B results in me thinking "who cares?". 2 VP and 6 bucks vs 8 bucks vs 1 VP and 5 bucks. Whatever. I won our last game by buying boroughs like mad and playing any paired up colors I had when I had 4 or 5 sets. I didn't even particularly care what I drew. Two browns? Play them. Drew an omnibus. Free money. Whee.

Then there are a few cards that are simply overpowered compared to everything else (omnibus, underground), particularly in games with fewer players. So, if you draw well and score 2 omnibuses in a 2 player game you get a huge (unbeatable perhaps as alexfrog's initial thread posits?) advantage.

Wallace needs new play testers.

Ahh London, it seems like everyone is rushing to be disappointed with you.  The game is semi-broken (the card rush), or the replay value is limited (your turn options are limited to 3 different actions, the board never changes).  I've played the game with 4 twice, which was much fun, and all parties involved liked the game a lot.  With 2, however, the game is even better, as you have much more control, and can dictate what cards your opponent has access to much more.  The theme is nice (Ashar, as the resident Anglophile, particularly likes it) and the components very well done.  Yes, this is not a game that is radically different every play.  Many have complained that the cards are not different enough.  Well, I don't have a problem with subtle, and the cards have different values at different player counts.  This is one of those games with fairly limited parameters, but within those parameters everything is quite elastic - you could win running your city every third turn, or running it twice in a game.  This is not a heavy Wallace game - indeed, this is a light-to-medium weight game, but Wallace's best of those.  It might fall from the 10 in time, but as of now, this is my favorite Wallace design since Brass (although he's coming on strong lately, as First Train to Nuremberg is also pretty great).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
There is a nice Civ-feel to this game that I like a lot, especially because I'm a huge British history fan.  It reminded me a little of Through the Ages, though it's much lighter and the game plays much faster. I also think the design is really interesting: you both want and don't want cards, either in your hand or in your tableau, which means you both want and don't want to buy districts (because they make you draw cards). Buying smaller districts means you draw fewer cards, and thus take fewer poverty tokens, but they also earn you fewer victory points. Building more buildings helps you gain more wealth and points, but also can hurt you immensely if you have too many in front of you. The fun of the game lies in finding the right balance between these elements.

Relatively simple game rules-wise, but lots of interesting decisions.  Will take a few more plays to tell if I really like it though.

Second Play - Game really clicked for me.  I can see this getting a lot of plays.  Great engine building without being overwhelming.

EDIT - Still really like this one.  Just tempering my rating to an 8.

EDIT - Traded for Fresco.

One play left me a bit worried that this was a bit long for its weight but very much looking forward to more plays and I'm pleased that we've been able to fit them in.  Those plays have speeded it up and confirmed that it's mostly a question of familiarity with the cards - a perennial issue for all these 'rules on the cards' type games.  The cards are themed to the re-building of London after the great fire, but that is only window dressing for a light civ-building game.  As ever with Wallace, you have to balance the upsides against the downsides, with few choices being only 'good' and none of those easy options as lucrative as the others, which involve suffering something 'bad'. For me that adds a notch or two to what is, compared to most Wallaces, an otherwise straightforward game.

My 1,000th game rated on BGG, woohoo, and what a great game to hit 1,000 with!

I really enjoyed this game of hand management.  Very difficult decisions throughout!  Should I go with few piles I can operate more often, or build up for some big city operations?  Do I discard this card or that card?  Keeping a good balance between generating income, scoring points, and keeping your poverty down is a tough balance!

I thought the board play felt a little tacked on, but it was still enjoyable to have that option available, even though it felt a little detached from the card play aspect.

In addition to just being fun to play, the game is also gorgeous, especially with the limited edition buildings, which amazingly are in a different shape for each color.  Very unexpected and over-the-top, and makes the board look that much cooler as the game progresses.

Overall, one of the simpler to learn Martin Wallace designs in quite a while; perhaps the fist that hasn't produced a bunch of questions after the first read through the rules.  However, despite the simple rules, there are all kinds of interesting decisions as I've come to expect with Martin's games.  If you like hand management type games, definitely don't pass this one up!

RATING: 7
Both my wife and I really wanted to like London, in part because we like Brass so much, in part because of the artwork, theme, and subtle thematic details. It seemed like a very good game for us. 

Unfortunately, our first game lacked cohesion and any sense of progress. We were just sort of taking actions because we had to do something, but we were making the same small circle of decisions at the end of the game as we were at the beginning. We mostly felt along for the ride rather than at the helm of our cities. By about 1/3 of the way through the deck in our first game, we were flush with money and VP, and poverty was easily sidestepped. Yet we still had to continue playing with no goal to motivate us other than to continue to amass money and VP. There was nothing to build toward, no target to aim for, and nothing that depended much on our previous choices. It was just, "Oh, this card gives me more money and VP than this other one. I guess I'll discard the latter to play the former." My wife went the last 1/3 of the game without accumulating a single poverty point (even based on cards in hand at the end of the game). She had purchased half the boroughs, had made enough money to pay back all of her loans and then some, and yet we still felt trapped in the draw-a-card, pick-an-action cycle.

And I think under the tedium of this forced, but somewhat meaningless decision-making, my wife declared the game "soul-crushing." (She meant it in the same sense that you or I might declare a three-hour game of The Settlers of Catan "soul-crushing").

A geekbuddy of mine had the following comment on Tikal II: The Lost Temple, and was amazed at how much I could relate to it based on my experiences with two-player London:
enzo622 wrote:
I mean, it's just too easy to do everything you want to do. ... So each turn is, "I go here for 5 points. Your turn. I go here for 6 points. Your turn. Etc." 

... We all just went to the rooms we hadn't each explored yet and got our obligatory points. After all that going 'round, I pulled out two bonus cards for 15 points for the win. I kinda felt bad in the last few turns knowing I was sitting on 15 points and watching the other players make their moves. It didn't matter much what they did and I knew it.

Our last 1/3 of the game was pretty much: play all the cards in your hand, run your city to accumulate money and VP, buy a borough that gives you a handful of cards, play all the cards in your hand, run your city to accumulate money and VP, buy a borough that gives you a handful of cards, play all the cards in your hand. I was pretty confident that I had more VP cards in my stacks than my wife (I took many more loans early on, whereas she tried to tread water with money-generating cards), so the continued play felt pretty meaningless, other than the hope of her drawing to some 15-point mega card that may or may not exist. 

There's little sense of accomplishment -- just loop after loop of playing cards, running cities, and buying districts. Most of the stuff ends up face down at the bottom of a stack, so I can't even feel proud of my monument or my schools. There are some things I would do differently next time, and places where I now see that I could be more efficient. But given that I was pretty clearly winning, there was no incentive to win better (especially in a learning game). 

Thus, I found the game to lack an emotional payoff -- the sense of accomplishment that should come with a building-themed game. Despite the designer's clear efforts to make each card appropriately thematic, there wasn't a sense of narrative or cohesion that made me feel like I was crafting a city. I didn't dislike the experience, but I liken it to playing Dominion by shuffling 3 copies of every card from every expansion into a single, large deck from which everyone draws a new hand each turn. It's just sort of odd. 

Our second game used a 2-player variant to shorten the game, but I've concluded that London just seems to lack the per-minute entertainment value for me. The whole game is building your city to run, but running the city really only happens about once every 20 minutes, and the payoff is a handful of VP chits and a few plastic money disks. Something about that just seems wrong. But, unlike my wife, at least I don't find it soul-crushing. 


Update:
As I’ve gained experience, [i]London[/i] has become a game that I’m increasingly enjoying.  I went ahead and upgraded to the limited edition, which has produced a noticeable atmospheric effect for the better.  The game, especially with two, still feels like something of a relaxing stroll, rather than a frantic competition, but I’m continually understanding the game’s subtleties more and more.

Really enjoyed the first play of this one. Plenty going on but choices tend to be fairly simple on your go. Control the Poverty as much as you can while trying to gain points from every angle. Money comes and goes very quickly in this one. Great Stuff. 2 Plays.

RATING: 6
The most interesting aspect of this game is managing your poverty. Also, it is fun to build up your city, run it, and then rebuild it over and and over again. The combos that you generate aren't spectacular, or even cool really, but it is fun to do it over and over again.

It does seem though, that the rhythm you want to get into is build city, run city, buy borough, repeat. Which, while fun now, will probably get stale relatively quickly. Oh yeah, and get Omnibus and street lights.

This is probably why most times if I want to engine build, I'd rather it either be dynamic, like Dominion, or over the top, like Glory to Rome.

The biggest downside to this game is that it probably works best with four, taking longer to play with fewer and being much looser.

Note, the game is not colour blind friendly, as we noticed when one of the players tried to pay for a pink card using a grey card. They looked identical to him. Now, that was solved by simply pointing out that all pauper cards were grey, but if someone couldn't differentiate between any of the other colours, there is absolutely nothing else on the cards to help them figure out which colour is which.

Painful and overlong, but also kind of brilliant. It builds on the tableau style games in very interesting ways and adds the brutal debt/poverty/kick-in-the-nuts. I like it, but prefer my tableau-builders soundly in the 30-60 minutes range. Still, I'd play it again in a heartbeat, if for no other reason than to assure myself that I'm not as stupid as I felt after losing some fifty or more points in end-game poverty and debt losses. Cool design, nice artwork. I will reevaluate after more plays.

This game is what San Juan would be if it had managed to pass an 'O' level in British Social & Economic History. It is essentially a card game despite the board. There are four types of cards which provide income and victory points and increase or reduce poverty. Paupers annoyingly do nothing but clog up your hand unless you can put them to work. The mechanics work well enough but downtime between turns can drag as there is no real interaction. The end can become quite gamey as no one wants to trigger the last round. Not bursting to play this again though no doubt I'll be slightly more efficient next time round.

Finally got to play and wasn't as enamored as I thought I would be. I like card play and felt the combos were weak in this one. There is very little interaction, if any, and it's primarily a game of solitude. The game board felt a little out of place as well along with the boring art. There wasn't much interaction or decisions on game board. The game has good ideas and is entertaining enough by maximizing points while balancing the negative effects. Overall, it could be much better than what it is with refinement.

Long for a card game, but a very well designed card game nonetheless.  I have never been disappointed by a M. Wallace designed game that I have purchased, and now my library of non-rail based Wallace games is growing quite a bit.

Lot's of strategy as you build up your city "engine", but there is always enough going on within the confines of the game that you need to plan out a few turns in advance to take advantage of all the cards you have in play.

First (and only) play was 2-player.  I imagine it will play much differently as a 4-player game, as I think the cards would cycle out much faster.

Nice little game where I can get a glimpse of London as I rebuild it. At first it is a little intimidating seeing poverty counts go up, but you soon realize this is easily managed. I like the balance of adding negative score (poverty) with increasing actions (more stacks on building displays). Good timing and planning are essential for this.

I must have been nuts when I pre-ordered the limited edition. It's more than I'd typically spend on a game...certainly without playing it previously or reading the rules. 

Fortunately, this game is (for now) a solid 8, maybe more with more plays. I found the iconography and gameplay of Race for the Galaxy to be a bit confusing and lackluster. With London, sure there's text on the cards, but it's clearer what each card can do. On any given turn, you take four basic choices, but the various cards effects provide variety.

The game is a balance between money, VPs, and poverty. And, it's pretty tight. I really enjoyed my first game. It's a bit slow the first goaround, with everyone reading the cards in their hands, focused on their own little cities. 

There's probably a bit of solitaire to this game. 4 players might take too long, and 2 players might not provide enough tension on the board. But, I like how the theme comes through with the card types, and I enjoy the tough balance of resources.

Update: first two player game with my wife. Wasn't sure if she would like it, but after one play, she's definitely willing to try it again. A two player game is a bit "leisurely," with less tension on the board. It's more an extended exercise in optimization. But as a spouse game, that's not all that bad.

Update: after six plays, I traded it away in a math trade (for Claustrophobia). I like the theme, I like the cards. But ultimately, my knocks on the game are that two players offers not enough angst, and four players takes too long. It's a very solitaire experience. Those are ultimately the downfalls.

RATING: 6
A tableau card game with a little bit of board play and an interesting poverty mechanism. I really like the idea of to play a card to your tableau you must play a card of the same color that then becomes available for everyone. This leads to some tough decisions. Definitely enjoy this as a 2-player game with the dummy variant as it definitely helps move the game along which it sorely needs. A little longer for my tastes and I don't like how you burn through the entire deck every game a more variable end game condition would have been appreciated. Lastly, I do wish the VP chits were a score track around the board as keeping score would have been so much easier and no need to do it all at the end.

RATING: 7
:sugar: :( :) :D :D This is a tableau-building card game; the game on the board is of minimal importance and interest. (Though the purchase of boroughs is [i]highly[/i] important if you want to, well, win.)

A tough game to get a handle on: Race For The Galaxy is a more multi-dimensional and strategically rich game, Pax Porfiriana has a much richer theme and narrative drive, and Fleet is just a tighter and more focused design overall. London, while good, should by rights be a bit squeezed out.

But, I come back to London all the time, and I just enjoy it every go, and I don't think that's the nostalgia talking. Some of that is the presentation talking. The cards, with their hand-drawn images of Victoriana (and earlier, and later) stir a bit of Anglophilia I wasn't quite sure I had. And the game makes some hay out of a tight little rule set.

Money flows early and dries up late, so there's a bit of the old Dominion dynamic of setting up a money engine then concentrating on VPs later on. Most cards seem pretty balanced but in the best possible way -- they enable a good player with bad draws to overcome a bad player gifted with the good cards. There are a few combos (the dreaded double Omnibus leaps to mind, or an early draw of East India Company and Hospital) that are probably a bit overpowered.

Do you [i]need[/i] this if you're satisfied with your existing stash of tableau-builders? Probably not. But as of this writing, I've played this 12 times, it's the most recent game I've played, and if it was the [i]next[/i] game I played, I wouldn't be upset. That's some decent staying power.

1 play, 2 players using 3rd player dummy variant (BenLuca) ... Good game. Reminded me of St. Petersburg, though I liked this better. The poverty, of course, reminded me of Unrest in Struggle of Nations. Like the leverage that shortens game length that the variant gives.

Copy/pasted from my discussion here:
http://boardgamegeek.com/article/7136875#7136875

I am finding that games with a large set of cards you can't possibly learn without experience that all do wacky and unpredictable stuff, especially when players have hidden hands of such cards, just don't resonate with me. Although I still find the game interesting, just not terribly fun.

My "dream" euro game is one where anything random and unseen is at least easily understood up front, and/or comes up in a way that it can be understood when it comes up, before it directly affects any single player positively or negatively. Games like Dominant Species on the long end, and Troyes and Lancaster on the shorter end (just to pick a couple recent games) exhibit this property. That is, I want to be able to "load" the whole FSM in my brain. Modifying the FSM midgame (like in Troyes) is also ok, so long as it affects everyone, and everyone sees it before it takes effect. If some of the variables which certain transitions depend on are unknown to me, I'm ok with that, but it's the structure that I want to understand. And while the game obviously has a high level FSM that is easy to understand (how to get cards and build boroughs), it's not at a level of detail that includes any of the important state changes like gaining money or losing poverty. (If people looked at my collection, they could probably find counter examples. It's possible that I'm not articulating this with pinpoint accuracy.) 

This game also falls into another category of games that I'm finding don't thrill me. It's a specific subcategory of multi-player solitaire: games where you can base your decisions on what other players are doing, but it's really hard to keep tabs on what the other players are doing. In games like Goa, players bump up against each other for a while (a good thing), then do their own stuff. And if you look at someone else's stuff, it's easy to parse their state . There is a set of variables, and you can see at a glance what those variables are (just look at their levels on their board, and resources on hand). In London, on the other hand, if you want to actually compete with your fellow players, rather than just enjoy building your little corner of the universe, you need to really pay attention to what cards they have in front of themselves. And for another example game: Merkator, although London is much worse in this regard, as Merkator's cards are all consistent and only vary by a small set of fixed parameters, and are also longer lasting. But the cards in London are hard to tell what they do at a glance (impossible from across the table, unless you already know the card and can read the title--art is generally too detailed to be easily recognizable as a cue). And it's even harder to tell how they interact together. Because they are all interconnected. Not to mention that in London a large portion of a players cards in front of them (or even all of them) can completely change in a single turn. So if you want to base your play on what your opponents are up to, you have to do a lot of un-fun work (based on my definition of fun, of course).

This is a tight economic game that involves the rebuilding of London after the great fire.  There are limited ways to make money but a lot of ways to spend it, so careful management is necessary.

The other key mechanic is poverty - every time you choose to activate your cards, you will likely pick up these dreaded points.  So your goal is to find ways to reduce those points as often as possible.

Once the mechanics are understood, this game zips along at a good pace.  Most of the components are very nice (especially the artwork on the cards), although the money chips are a disappointment (the limited edition has better wooden counters).

On the whole a great game from Martin Wallace that I expect will get lots of play in our house!

I'm not so great at it, but at least there are enough gameplay mechanics in it. I liked it.

I don't really like the designers point of view in general, choice of gameplay feel (most of the time I don't but I do more in London), and I don't see sarcasm in the themes as much as out and out meanness. The ideas presented in many games by him particularly this one, well there seems to be an air of rudeness and elitism that I do not like evident. 

I find not so much in common ideas wise. I realize he is smarter than me. This is the 14th best game I have tried right now preference wise as far as me wanting to replay it. That is awfully good. My average rating for games right now is 6. London scored at this date an 8.6 so yeah that is a great game. It had a business like feel. It felt like a cross between Glory to Rome and At the Gates of Loyang.

The game takes a new twist about card combos. It's interesting building your cards for a while, and then run it altogether. And typical of Martin Wallace games, it's not abstract. There's quite a theme interwoven to the mechanics there, and it gives opportunity for clever play. I like it.

RATING: 7
Components: The board looks nice, and could only be improved by reserving a space in each borough for our building tiles. The backs of the cards should be more plain, to help differentiate them from face-up cards. The iconography is clear. The card images are interesting. Several cards are unambiguous, yet have clarifications in the rules that add an additional rule that we would never have thought to look for clarification on, because the card doesn't skirt the issue.

Experience: Tight budgeting game. I try to efficiently set up my city, then run it while my hand size is at a minimum and my borough buildings at a maximum. At the beginning money is easy to come by, but then suddenly it's very tight.

Like Agricola, the game seems to want me to dabble in everything. I'll be interested to see if strategies exist that focus on just a few aspects of the game (e.g. just on building in boroughs, or just on high-VP cards, etc.). Going through the entire deck each time might become a bit repetitive, but I'm eager to dive back in.

Überstrategy² with lack of luck, because even with very bad draw, you still have tons of possibilities how to use these cards in your own strategy. Theme is strong and fun during playing even stronger. But you must be prepare on game, which is played as a "multi solo". In fact it´s like hodgepodge of Glory to Rome/San Juan/Race for the Galaxy; just on board.

London is one of those games that seems well designed on paper, but when you actually play with real people the game just isn't exciting. The constant cycling and lack of buildup is annoying. I also can't understand why you are allowed to look at the top card of the deck. This just makes the game even longer.

A very interesting game flow marred by the need to play repeatedly before you can come up with good card selection strategies. However, I suffered from having rules leap out at me during play in my two sessions (I was not the 'splainer in either game), including learning *after* taking extra cards from the display on my last turn that that was *very bad*. I really want to like this game, but I fear it won't make the cut with my group after our most recent session left everyone feeling like an idiot.

Sort of feels like Race for the Galaxy, but it has mechanics that differ enough to make me want to play it. But there are some problems:

(1) If someone gets 2 Omnibuses in a 2-player game, they win. Two player sucks in general, but can be improved: http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/621605/the-ben-luca-2-player-variant
(2) Even though it's one action a turn, there's a lot of AP.
(3) Almost no player interaction. There are a few cards that screw your opponent but in general there's no need to pay attention to other people's tableaux.

One play, was tired, but struck me essentially as a economic building game vaguely related to RFTG or SJ, but without significant strategic planning.  Maybe that comes more with more knowledge of the cards, but the fact will remain that most cards are one shot only when they are used in your tableau - this sets you back to a near blank slate for each running of your city.  So you are just reacting to the cards drawn and available in the display area, and trying to maximize immediate utility.  The poverty tokens are a clever mechanism put to throttle back a players ambitions though - I will grant that.

Will give this another shot.

London is a good play.  We played with three, and it was a lot of fun.  It was a little long, but the up side is that you had time to get your strategy and engine going even with the first play.  Plenty of replay, as the different color cards have unique behaviors.  One of the guys said it plays best with two.  Definitely worth your time to try, as the rules & teaching time is very short.  Very well done.

2011-02-25:7.4>6 Starting to get tired of this game. I think random cards maybe go better with lighter games. I still love the mechanics that essentially require constant card evaluation to decide what cards to use for payments and which to use for their function. However, something about it is starting to grate.
--------------------
I'm in two minds about the presence strictly superior cards. On one hand, it allows for some easier choices and keeps the game moving. On the other, it definitely introduces more luck into the game (needlessly, in my opinion).

I think there could have been better-and-worse cards without having the strictly-superior versions of brown cards. It's just a few that I have issue with.

RATING: 5
High expectations for this game.

My limited plays never really allowed me to explore the depth of this game.  I made the mistake of reading about the "broken" "strategy" regarding the Omnibus card, and was always trying to pull it off (in my head I was comparing it to the "Money" strategy in Dominion).  It never worked for me, which made me happy, but it also meant I was never actually delving into the gamespace on a personal level.

Overall, I think there is a good, albeit slow, game that offers lots of depth and replayability.  I just never got the chance to find that out for myself.

A unique card game from one of my favorite designers. Here you have to rebuild London through card play, while buying up land and avoiding the constantly accumulating poverty cubes. I enjoy the clever ways theme is integrated into the play, and since I have visited London a few times and know a bit of its history I can appreciate the story it tells. I enjoy the occasional game...almost defines a 7 for me.

On the lighter side of Treefrog games with a 90 min. playtime.  Each player pretty much with head down on their own cards with blinders on.

Despite the rating, I do really enjoy this game. The dings against the game are really highlighted in the changes that the second edition made. The original had some very scripted opening moves - take loans, buy boroughs and then run the city without worry of poverty. The fact that boroughs could eliminate an entire concern of the game made it feel empty. The map of London, while nice looking, really wasn't that important to the game. Since boroughs could be bought adjacent to any player's borough and the map was then fixed, it was more eye candy than a functional part of the game. The tableau building was excellent. Important decisions to make about the size of the tableau vs. the negative effects it would provide. In all, I'm glad I played the original but even more excited to try the second edition.

Primarily a card game where you are managing money, poverty and victory points. There's a map portion of the game which also provides victory points and a way to deal with poverty and get extra card draws. Getting all this to work together the most efficiently is the object.

While I much prefer Brass, this is certainly a good game, too.

Very low interaction, but I like that in multiplayer games with lots of card text. Saves all that time reading everyone's cards.
As usual for Martin Wallace, there's lots of interlocking systems here all geared to tight resources. You want to do everything at once, but are constrained by limited money, growing poverty, hand limits on cards and a limited number of actions through the game. What to pick? More boroughs? Get more cash first? But need to earn points and reduce poverty. perhaps set up for the end game cards....
Flows reasonably fast. Good fun and leaves you thinking about what you could have done differently.

I've only played London in the two player configuration with the Ben & Zen - Luca variant (see end of comment) and I still feel that it runs a little too long.

All in all, I did enjoy the game, it's surprisingly thematic. I like the need to balance your VP and money needs versus poverty and debts. I still have to see, if I can run a larger city with ten or more stacks successfully. Until now, I had at most six stacks. Because of the poverty mechanism and the one-time only cards, the decision when to run your city is interesting. I'm looking forward to future plays but I'm still not completely sold on it.

VARIANT
-----------
Essential variant for two player game, otherwise two player game is too long/easy: Ben & Zen-Luca variant. Rule changes:
1. Every time you empty a full display, the player who triggered this adds a neutral building marker to any free borough, and draws and discards the appropriate amount of cards for that borough. (Alternative: do this whenever a player buys a borough - although then you'll only end up with 5 each).
2. No face up duplicate buildings allowed in a single player's city (not certain this is necessary, perhaps only apply to Omnibus?)
Alternative to try: start with 15 poverty points.

Brilliant design! This game and The Speicherstadt have opened a new category of games in my collection: the "Euro-Filler". 

Both are thoroughbred euro's with an economic theme but they consist of micro-turns and either can be played in an hour with 3-4 players, and probably 40 minutes with 2. 

And both games are perfect distillations of the designers' work: Wallace and Feld in their respective nutshells. 

At game nights what gets played is determined, at least once per night on most nights, by duration, so I generally have one of the two with me.

Edit: Raised rating to 9. Can be punishing, especially when compared to the point salad crap that's now in fashion. I love that this game doesn't baby you. 

Here's s little personality quiz:
If you get buried by a game and can't dig your way out, do you a) Blame the designer and say it's broken, or b) Want to play again to try to get it right?

London is strictly for type 'b's...

Only one 4-player game so far but was impressed. Lots of decsions and viable strategies, requires thought and planning without too much rule complexity. Deep enough to be a gamers game but still accessable enough to use on non-gamers and plays in a reasonably short time. Good components and art work - nothing really to dislike unless you are concerned about the luck element introduced by card variability or that the mechanics are perhaps not tied quite so well to the theme as MW often manages to achieve.

Looking forward to more plays and to see how it handles only two players.

Played two 4-players games today (Jan 29th, 2011). Very favourable first impressions. An easy 8. Want to play again.

The stack management mechanism is innovative and effective. The rewards and tradeoffs of various actions is very well done. Card draw "luck" is a factor but not overwhelmingly so. Several paths to victory.

All in all LONDON looks like a keeper.

I must admit, I was expecting more from this game.  The theme is really weak for a Wallace game.  Basically you are drawing some cards hoping for a good building combo at just the right time.  This will allow you to generate lots of resources (money/vps) which will hopefully allow you to rinse/repeat efficiently.  I might actually put this at 7, but I didn't care for the end-game.

The game ends a turn after when the deck is empty.  Not knowing if the other players will end it before your turn makes the final 2-3 turns painful.  Do you risk it and draw cards and potentially stick yourself with poverty on your final run?  Or do you take measly "build 1" actions?  Not much strategy there...and it drags as you have to do calcs on if this, then that, then if this...etc.  In the end, a player decides to take an action on a whim and it is all for nothing.

London, by Martin Wallace, is a card game with a small board attached to it. I have had a mixed relationship with Martin Wallace’s games. I am a big fan of Age of Steam and a moderate fan of Brass, but I have not been able to quite get into his more recent releases, and have found myself repeatedly excited about the idea of his games, only to find myself disappointed in their implementation. I pre-ordered London hoping it would break that trend, only to find myself disappointed when it merely confirmed it, and established Martin Wallace firmly in my try (multiple times) before buy camp.

London is fairly straightforward mechanically, each turn you draw a card, and then either play as many cards as you want into your city, which allows you to run your city, buy a borough, which gives you victory points, reduces the poverty you accumulate when running your city, and lets you draw cards, run your city, which activates your card’s special abilities, or draw three cards from the deck.

Further twists are added by the inclusion of loans, which allow you to fund your purchase of cards and boroughs, and poverty points, which cause you to lose victory points at the end of the game depending on where your poverty is relative to everyone else.

The cards themselves add much of the variety the game possesses, but they in themselves are much, much less interesting then something like Race For the Galaxy, Glory to Rome, or Innovation. In fact, my general opinion of the game is that, while it is adequate, it is much less interesting than most of the other games out there, lacking the interesting and crazy card combinations of Glory to Rome or Race For the Galaxy, and the in-depth interaction of Glory to Rome or Innovation. It is just sort of there, existing as a slightly boring game that is taking up a largely unnecessary niche. I can’t recommend this one unless you really, really like card games.

Players contribute to the re-building of London in the centuries following the Great Fire.  Card game, with a board.  Players take turns to draw a card, take an action, then onto the next player.  Actions are to build a city borough (costing you money, but giving you cards and victory points), play cards (onto the table into your beanfields, I mean building display), or run your beanfield.  Running your buildings mean paying any activation cost, earning a reward, and possibly flipping it over and out of the game - as well as earning some poverty points based on how well or how badly you've established yourself.  It's all about investment and return.  Nice game, quite simple, but still a bit of a weird beast - perhaps a little like San Juan in the card cost mechanic and building powers.  Tells a nice story, got me pleasantly wedged with some indecisive angst during the game, and the poverty points mechanics keep you honest.  Enjoyed it - perhaps a touch long and repetitive, and the board seems almost superfluous - but gives the game some nice context.  Fair bit of boredom in the four player game waiting for your turn, as interaction is low there is nothing to keep you engaged.  As a 2 player game, worth a look.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A great self-contained economy of cards. It is squarely in the same corner as San Juan and Race for the Galaxy, but I feel this is a much better game than either of those. 

The game doesn't so as deeply focus on divergent strategies as its predecessors, but it features some tight choices on debt, misery, and hand management. Fairly fast-playing once you've made it through a game.

As much as I admire the game, I find it a bit mechanical and lacking in fun. part of the "draft stuff and build a strategy" style.

RATING: 8
Themed around the rebuilding of the City of London, a deck of cards shared among all players is used to generate money and VPs. To play most cards requires discarding another card matching the colour, making it freely available to other players. The cards improve over three periods as the game progresses, changing the gameplay drastically. Money remains a tight resource the entire time, making it difficult to accomplish much without it. Players can invest money to take ownership over a number of districts in London, which help to alleviate the influx of poverty points acquired throughout the game. At the end players compare points from the districts, cards played and a comparison of poverty points to arrive at their final score. Very fun gameplay with plenty of excruciating decisions to make.

60-90m, best with 2-4 players. 5+ plays.

Excellent engine building game where you have to balance money, cards, building areas, points and poverty points just right. The theme fits well enough for some extra flavour, but is rather immaterial for this game. The rules are short and fairly simple and it's an easy to teach game. 
This is the sort of game I like so the initial rating of 8 could go up on subsequent plays. 
2016-06-13 : A 2-player game showed that there's really no deeper strategy than what was already obvious after the first play : buying boroughs early and often will win you the game. Score lowered to a 6 as a consequence.

London is in essence a tableau style card game.  I typically love this type of game and tend to try as many of them as possible.  This one includes a board.  I can't say that it shouldn't include one, but it does increase the cost of the game substantially compared to other card games.  Another noteworthy thing to mention about London compared to others of it's ilk, is that it's not a short affair.  This game is going to run about 30 - 45 minutes longer than similar games.

It's an easy game to learn.  On your turn, draw a card and do 1 of 4 possible actions: play cards, activate cards (aka running your city), buy land, or draw 3 cards.  There is a large balancing act in terms of getting money (there are also loans available), getting victory points, getting rid of poverty (negative VP at game's end if you do not have the least), as well as hand management.  There are many ways to do this.  You just have to find a way that's more optimal than your opponents.

Each card is designated by phase a, b, or c and the deck is comprised of phase a cards first, then b, then c.  While the game is enjoyable I'm hoping the game doesn't become scripted due to the composition of the layered cards and the fact that most of the cards in the deck simply revolve around vp, money, poverty or some combination thereof. Two-player games should use variants to prevent a dual omnibus strategy, and to tighten up some other aspects of the design.

While this is a good game, the length ended up being the biggest turn off for me compared to other tableau building games.

Spent half my adult life there & it has a good rating, so I got the game on merit alone.

It's possible that after a few plays you might become familiar with most of the buildings, but no more so than San Juan (which btw this game had some similar actions - such as paying for purchases and actions with cards held).  
Everyone enjoyed more than expected.

[2 plays] Came really close to winning the first time, then used the knowledge & experience I'd gained to do abysmally the second time.  Wait, what? 

London reminds me of some other games like RftG (and others that I can't think of now) that lure you into saving good cards in your hand, vainly hoping to be able to get them played.  I like London better than those games, though, because London forces you NOT to fall into that same doomed, self-defeating pattern.  

Like the theme, such as it is, and production.

This game is incredible.  It feels a little bit like Race for the Galaxy, with a constantly changing Tableau and other elements to keep in mind.  It takes a couple of plays to get the hang of, but it is really fun and there are lots of interesting interactions between certain cards.  Turns have a little bit of Merchants & Marauders syndrome -- some are very short and others are quite long, when the player decides to run their city.  Player interaction is low, but the discard area is a great idea in a game like this where the deck is cycled exactly once.  If the theme wasn't so awful I would probably give this a 9.5.  The artwork is good given the theme, but the graphic design of the card layout could use significant work.

Described by some as the most "euro" game of Wallace, like an advanced version of Saint Petersburg or even San Juan.  Seems best as a 3 player game - as two player game it gets too easy at the end with money/poverty points.  Outstanding in every way!  
See my comprehensive pictorial review: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/677333

Essential variant for two player game, otherwise two player game is too long/easy: [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/621605/the-ben-luca-2-player-variant]Ben & Zen-Luca variant[/url].  Rule changes:
1. No face up duplicate buildings allowed in a single player's city.
2. Every time you empty a full display, the player who triggered this adds a neutral building marker to any free borough, following the normal adjacency rules, and draws and discards the appropriate amount of cards for that borough. (Draw and discard four cards if all boroughs are already claimed.)

A simple yet still interesting take on the complex card game genre. The card-play mechanic of discard a (color) card to play a (color) card leads to very satisfying hand management decisions, and the way the cards interact differently in terms of VPs, money, and poverty keeps the game relatively tense. There’s a nice pull on adding cards to your city for those tasty benefits vs trying to control your sprawl as it leads to poverty, and I find a small vs large city both viable strategies which is nice. Poverty is the best feature of the game IMO because of the way it adds another constraint while forcing you to keep an eye on your opponents. 

It's an OK game with a moderately interesting challenge in terms of playing cards vs controlling your city size but the decisions aren't painful enough and the interaction isn't strong enough to provide the kind of experience that I think about between plays. On the other hand, it’s become my go-to gateway game for someone I think might enjoy the hobby or at least wants to try one of these games they hear me talk about.

This is an interesting game.  A lot to think about and a reasonable playing time.  And it's not clear to me that there's a single dominant strategy.  But after 8 plays, I'm not itching to play it---there's always something else I want to play instead.

4 and one half hours. It's an interesting if very very long exercise, but a lot does depend on the card draw. If the right cards are sat on the Display, you can build a nice tight city. Drive up your finance, harvest boroughs to offset your poor, then hammer them down with Sewers. If not, then it's a harder drag on loans, a slow slog building whatever you can get your hands on. After all the boroughs are taken, the game goes on another 90 minutes as we finally screw out the deck.

If you like this kind of thing, you'll love this kind of thing. If not, you won't find anything new here.

Theme almost present :
- the deck is made of 3 chronological decks that respect the history of the rebuilding of London
- poverty, represented by the cards, against which we must fight throughout the game (the more you have cards in hand and neighborhoods in the city, the more you must deal with poverty)
- subway building

The rules are simple, the game easy to access and fluid enough.

Three issues for me :
- games are a little bit long
- little interaction, apart some cards and the purchase of boroughs
- on 2 players configuration, it is easy enough to get rid of the poverty

Want to try 3 and 4 players configurations.

What can I say about London? I felt a bit like an economist/bookkeeper while playing, and while that didn't want to make me stop playing, when I walked away for five minutes I didn't want to go back either. My co-player called it dual-solitaire because of the lack of interaction, which I found spot on.

RATING: 8
Medium-weight card game with some on-board positional elements on the growth of London using historical events/buildings/effects on cards.  I particularly enjoy the poverty-cube element, and the apparent cause-and-effect on their accumulation (build prisons to reduce poverty; build a police force to send your poor folk off to burden someone else!).
Very satisfying gameplay, but enough of a learning curve to MtG-like card combinations that new players will likely be outclassed by experienced ones their first 2-3 games.

this is the best wallace game I have ever played (better than Brass due to its shorter playing time)
the only thing that kept me from giving a higher rating is the final round where - if you are unlucky - are obliged to draw additional cards which can give quite a few negative points.
After only games i cannot really say whether this was just coincidence but it happenend in both games and spoiled quite a bit of the game experience.

A fantastic tableau type game. You essentially re-build London following 1666. The cards and the history are great. Their uses and the way they slot together are very thematic. It's just great fun building up your city, getting cards to play into each other and managing the downside; poverty.

I really, really like this game. You could see my rating climb as I play it more often.

London is a combo-building card game. There is a board as well but it is pretty much unnecessary. Interaction is very low. There are a few card effects that also affect other players but those effects aren't dramatic, and each player chooses his actions solely for himself (in contrast to, say, Race for the Galaxy). As there are only a couple of basic effects, and usually many cards implementing them, card knowledge isn't essential, and you're not as dependent on specific cards.

Of course, that also means that plays won't be as varied over time. The main challenge in London is finding the right point in time to switch from build-up (i.e. generating cash and/or cards which are necessary to power up your engine) to VP generation.

Would seem to be more for collection than playing - still unopened, and so rated 6 (17/9/11).  UPDATE: finally one play - I can see why people might like this, I just don't. London game seems backwards. At 25% game time, the city pieces / locations are finished. At 75%, your at more mercy of random card draws.  That said, the other 3 players seem to like the board game London. I don't think I'm into card combinations / engine games as the others.

RATING: 8
London has a super smart card mechanic, connected strongly to the theme. I really love how all the parts come together. This is a wonderful game of balance and tough decisions. The learning curve is a bit steeper than expected, but you will get it before the game is through. This is more of a gamer's game than one would think given the paucity of the rules. It is not complicated but a lighter gamer may not have the easiest time keeping track of all the effects and repercussions of running their city.  There are familiar mechanics of gaining money to buy stuff and earning VPs, but London really plays like no other City Building / Economic game. I think what it does best is forcing the player to adapt to the cards in their hand. Each player needs to know what to sacrifice, when to sacrifice, when to reap and when to sow. I really do enjoy the decisions this game forces you to make. London still has a hard time escaping its rather repetitive "gain VP and gain money to do stuff" structure, but that point is far out-shined by everything else.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A card driven economic engine game based on building the city of London. The top 8 cards of the discard pile are displayed and can be drawn as if they were the top of the deck. When playing a building card, you need to discard a building of the same color, like Glory to Rome. Those two aspects help the randomness of the card draw and add a nice element of strategy to the game.

The board play wasn't very interesting, though a few cards gave bonuses to the location of your districts. The presence of the Take-That buildings seemed out of place. The opening plays seem a little scripted: unless you have a killer opening hand, populate a district for cards, taking a loan if necessary. Then, you need to build up some quick money in buildings and run the city. After that the game has more variability.

The longevity of the game will be the cards themselves. I could see this game gaining or losing my esteem based on how interesting the interactions remain.

RATING: 9
Another hit by Wallace. This is a light to medium weight game that has deck building as a core mechanic and adds a board/spatial element to the mix. I like how poverty works. You can have a lean machine (tableau with a few cards) or a huge powerful machine; one will not generate much but at the same time won't generate poverty cubes while the other will be punished for being so big. Each people's play style emerges here and it is so evident that I found it fascinating.

I never expected to like this a lot, but the first time I played I was mercilessly thrashed and could see the potential. The second time I played I was mercilessly thrashed again and realised I'd remembered nothing from the first time. The third time it was me handing out the thrashing, and the fourth time it was a good competition. Looking forward to playing more, it works very sweetly.

Yet another great Martin Wallace game. Very thematic card-based game that comes with a pretty board (though I think the board is somewhat redundant). Having to take care of rising poverty as you expand London is a nice touch that adds to the complexity of this game that's easy to play, but very hard to master - exactly what games should be :-)

Not a pretty game in any way.  Solid mechanics with a really taxing poverty mechanic (sort of like corruption in the Scoundrels of Skullport but much harder to get rid of).  Interesting enough, certainly solid mechanically, but not terribly interesting or thematic.

Surprising hit in our house. Although maybe not surprising as we seem to like Martin Wallace games.

Hard to categorise this game as you have to manage your cards, manage what you discard, try to reduce your poverty points and don't get into too much debt. Plus it's fun when you get Buckingham Palace - almost has to be built even at the cost of a loan! Just not patriotic to discard it.

Played twice so far, with 2 and 4 players.  Second game I thought I had it won.  I had built into the most neighbourhoods, I had the Underground going, I had the most cash...but I got crippled in the end with too many poverty points.  I ended up losing 28 points because of them, and finished dead last!  

The key seems to be finding a compromise between getting a lot of in-game points and using as few buildings as possible.  

My first impression of London is very, very positive.  This is his most streamlined and friendly game so far.

I am more impressed than ever after playing it for a third time.  It is a very simple game yet offers a good amount of strategy and planning.  The end game rushes up so quickly, but doesn't feel artificial.  This might end up being my favourite Wallace game of all.

Some concerns over there being too much of an optimal strategy.

I was really excited when this game came out, of course I was, I love Martin Wallace games. First play and I really wanted it, ordered it that night from GameGuru.
Played it twice the next night and discovered it lets itself down badly. It doesn't feel right, it doesn't feel like a Wallace and is way to random and rigid in play pattern.

It really feels like there is a right way to play and a wrong way, and if anyone who doesn't play it "the way" loses.

Basically, if you have money you should buy a borough.
Go through 2 to 3 play/activate steps to create a sustainable poverty model that generates VPs without adding poverty and play out whilst others end the game.

2) When a player expends a card forcing a clearing of a row in the card display, that player places a neutral marker of a third colour in a city borough of their choice. The appropriate number of cards based on that borough are drawn from the deck and immediately discarded.

My first proper Wallace game. (I did slump through a game of A Few Acres of Snow online but didnt get the feel.) 

London, however, was an instant hit. The rules are quite simple leaving the complexity to shine in the timing of the management of hand, city activation, burough acquisition, and poverty. The economy is tight but not too tight that you constantly feel frustrated. 

CONS
-End game scoring is a bit tedious.
-And my biggest beef is that there is very little screwage or player interaction.

Despite these, this a fun game worth owning.

RATING: 7
London is not a great game, but it is among the best and most replayable of the Treefrog games. I've already played it more times than any of the other Treefrog games - which often seem to be fun for one or two plays and then crash hard. I enjoy figuring out which cards I want in my city, and the wonderful draft/expend card display system helps make the decisions interesting. I don't think the two-player game works very well. Four is best, provided you have no slow players.

There seem to be two main approaches to the game. The first is to cycle through the stages of buying one or two boroughs, playing cards, and running your city. The other approach is to buy several boroughs right away, discarding most of the cards instead of playing them, then running your city repeatedly in the late stages of the game. The second approach will definitely win if it finds most of the best permanent, non-flipping cards: Omnibus, Omnibus, Lord's, British Museum (all from B deck) and Natural History Museum, Grand Hotel, and either Public Houses or Parliament (all from C deck). Unfortunately, this latter approach is robotic, ham-handed and uninteresting. London is a card game, so it doesn't bother me that favorable draws will sometimes (usually?) determine the winner. It does bother me, though, that one of the two major strategies circumvents all the interesting tactical parts of the game. I prefer to play with four players because this strategy is very weak with that number.

My second criticism of London is that the game system is too damped and constrained. Play falls into predictable patterns, with no opportunity to break loose. Your task is to identify and manipulate small efficiencies within the tightly scripted game flow. This scripted play really highlights the game's lack of depth. There isn't enough room to maneuver around the luck of the draw, and there isn't enough opportunity to outplay your opponents.

Some players will also criticize London for its very limited player interaction. For me this is a feature rather than a bug. But if you were disappointed with the level of interaction in games like Saint Petersburg, Race for the Galaxy, or 7 Wonders, then you will be similarly disappointed with London.

Played 3 times with 2 and 4 players. Martin Wallace games are starting to annoy me or maybe it is just Treefrog. Please employ a graphic designer. This time we do get nice illustrations but the effort is ruined because they are printed poorly and just plunked square on a flat coloured background. The cards are drab and this makes the game drab. Look at the Dominion cards or the Thunderstone cards or just about any professionally produced offering and they make Treefrog look like a bunch of amateurs. The game probably plays best with 3 which is a number I have yet to play with. With 4 there is too much downtime and with 2 the fight for least poverty losses its tension. July 2011.

The way in which the cards inter-relate with each other has given us plenty of options here on how to utilise these cards to form your Building Display and then you have to decide exactly when to Run the city. I have tried various strategies like taking out several loans in order to build the cards which have high VPs and then building over them, but I was caught out by not earning enough cash by the end game to pay off all my loans. Another strategy was to build cards which reduced Poverty Points but I didn't buy enough land to offset the generation of 'new' Poverty points whenever I ran my city !!

Martin W has given us a great challenge here to get the balance right to produce a winning score. Most of the folk I have played with have enjoyed it, the only 'moan' being about the game end trigger. I have produced my own one-page summary for this which I use to highlight to new players the need to plan ahead for the end game scoring so that they maximise their opportunities to influence their final score.

Played it once in Essen with 4 players, loved it, and bought it to play with 2 (since I found it had too much downtime with 4).

RATING: 7.5
London has fairly simple and straightforward rules.  It is easy to learn, teach and play, but it is very difficult to play well.  Players are forced to try new strategies each game as the cards will appear in a different order each time.  This keeps the game fresh, challenging and intriguing.  Although Wallace's games aren't traditionally prone to generating expansions, this could be an exception, as it is easy to envision additional building cards being made available.  That would certainly be welcome, as it will continue to add to the options and difficulties in mastering the game.  High marks to Wallace for designing a game with an intriguing historical backdrop that is easy to play, yet extremely challenging and enticing.

The financial system (loans/card cost/income) works well as I would expect from a Martin Wallace design and the penalties from the black cubes create a pretty good tension for decisions over the course of the game.  For being primarily card-based, though, I would have liked a little more interaction between card effects to chain together.

Nice game, but having to build up london asap is something I dislike, as it's a must.

Away from that, it's a cool hand management card game, but without much interaction, if at all. Reminds me of Macao (card play) and Notre Dame (rats/poverty).

RATING: 7
A simple game that does a lot with what it has. There are essentially only two currencies: money and cards. This means the game can move at a fair pace as at any time it isn't too challenging to assess in what way you want to change money into points. Poverty is a minor niggle, but it is effectively a form of points, just with some complications. The theme comes through impressively from relatively simple card interactions: paying the police to move poverty along feels thematic, as does sending your paupers through the shipyards for cash. A good light financial game that gives a decent heft of game in under an hour.

In the past, Martin Wallace has tried very hard to make his games look boring (bland art, dull colours, austere design), and London is no exception. Sitting on my board game shelf, it looks like something that was released in 1979. But hey, let’s not judge a book by its cover. This is an excellent card-driven game that seamlessly combines interesting mechanics and tough decisions. It’s simpler than most Wallace fare, and plays quicker too, but this gives it a streamlined feel that works in its favour. Overall, an enjoyable and thoughtful gaming experience, even if it does look like something I found in my Grandpa’s attic.

RATING: 8.5
Gives me the same feeling and satisfaction than swimming breast stroke:

1) Glide - Enjoy the money made in last cycle, buy some areas and fill your hand for a new cycle. The longer the glide the better it feels.
2) Pull - Play your full hand of cards in preparation of the next phase, load yourself like a coiled spring.
3) Kick - Run the city and release all that energy to start a new, loooong glide towards the goal, hopefully making distance to your competiton. And like in swimming, if your pull is not completely done when you start the kick you'll get punished (by poverty in this case) and it will affect your position in the contest.

Great game, where the enjoyment really comes from optimizing the technique and flowing seamlesly from one phase to another.

RATING: 8.25
I like the simple flow of the game (build city, run city, buy land - and repeat). Maybe there are balance issues with some cards, but as a light/medium weight card tableau game this is pretty decent. I have played three times, and while I give good rating for this game, I suspect there might not be endless amount of replayability here.

RATING: 4
After one play, I can see some of the strategies, especially some of the card combos.  This is a balancing game, where you can't ignore money or poverty or number of stacks.  Poverty markers can be overcome with the right cards, but will you get one?

My second play was a 2-player game with the Ben-Zen-Luca variant.  Even with the variant burning through cards, it took too long.  I think this game is rife with the opportunity for analysis paralysis.  There are too many choices with all the different cards in hand, similar to Race for the Galaxy or Glory To Rome.  Do I build this card on a stack for its powers, and if I do, what do I discard to the Card Display (which then becomes available to the other players)?

This isn't nearly as good a game as Brass or Age of Steam, which don't inspire so much paralysis based on the luck of the draw.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Decent.  I kept thinking, "this reminds me of Race" during the entire game, take that as you will.  Theme feels kind of pasted on and independent of the gameplay but the mechanics are interesting enough.  I would play it again but I wouldn't buy it.

The game works well with two, though it does run long for what is primarily a card game (new edition eliminated the map board). No real desire to return to it, though the new edition looks much nicer. Minimal player interaction combined with some Euro abstraction can make this feel more like work than play. Also, it felt odd/creepy to manipulate urban poverty to win a board game. Ditched it.

RATING: 6
This made a very good first impression on me and I immediately wanted to play again. Hand management, economic management, and time management come together for an intense game. The unremitting threat of poverty keeps the pressure high.

=========
Update: What I said above remains true, but the shine is fading off this one pretty quickly. The problem is downtime. With so much card interaction there's a LOT to consider, leading to a bit more downtime than I'd like. Especially on those turns where all you are doing is buying a property, you can spend a lot of time waiting for a turn which requires little thought. 

Also, I have a strong suspicion that the extremely rare special action cards are just a bit too powerful, which can really skew the game in the favor of the person who draws them. Either they ought to be weaker, so as not to affect the game as drastically, or more common, so everybody has a better chance to draw them.

2011 Christmas present from Mom & Alan.  This is a card game from Martin Wallace that I like fairly well since it resembles Race for the Galaxy in some ways.  Money is very important in this game and there is way to take loans.  This game takes at least 2 hours to play and it plays much better with 4 than with 3 in my opinion.

This is a longish (~2 hour w/ 4 player) game with a very open ended set of strategies, particularly given that there are only 4 actions you can choose from on your turn.  Pretty good quality game with nice, if minimal, components. 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.25
A kinder, gentler Wallace indeed, London is a card based tableau game with some area control, and some of Wallace's trademark economic managaement of 'bad stuff'. It comes across as friendlier in the end game scoring, even though it threatens to overwhelm in mid-game, and it also seems to play fairly close in score, at least based on my 1st solo play.  I like it- a lot, and I truly expect this rating to rise as I play it more, but I also wonder if kinder and gentler aren't Wallace's greatest strengths, and if I will like this one the way I do Brass, Steam/AoS and Conflict of Empires. But a terrific game, and one that will definitely get some plays going forward.

Reminds me of Railroad Tycoon. In Railroad Tycoon, you build your network, upgrade your engines so you can make a longer delivery, and then make the delivery to generate cash. In London, you buy territories to gain cards, play those cards, then run those cards to generate cash.

On the other hand, there seems to be a lot more luck in London than in Railroad Tycoon.

A hit from Martin Wallace. It's an area control game (you want to expand on the board faster than anyone and make sure you are ahead when the places run out), it's a deck building game but it's also an economic game...

finely balanced you must build your city carefully so that you can get combos and keep your cash flow up, but also make sure you can keep turning that cash into points

Moderated to a 9 in March 2015, it's still a fantastic game. I will not turn down a game of it. But the amount of in game text puts off some people

RATING: 10
This is seriously a great game, with unique card-driven mechanics and Martin Wallace pedigree. It is what San Juan is to Puerto Rico, as London is to Brass. The flavor is there, with just the right amount of abstraction to make the game speedy and fun to play. San Juan and London loosely share similar city building mechanics, where cards can be several things. However, London keeps the card morphing simple, leaving out the money and poverty as tangible items and not as cards. Also, London has a board component, giving an additional tangible element lacking in San Juan; players loosely engage in an area-control/VP grab through boroughs, but these areas are critically tied to the relative efficiency of running the cities represented by cards.

The game has a sizable footprint, for being a "card game", but it is manageable. The components are good, although it is highly recommended sleeving the cards, which get a lot of use.

Although there was concern that the game was broken, based on various comments on BGG, this doesn't seem to be the case. If players are alert, no single player will get away with the majority of the boroughs. The game offers what looks like a number of different strategies, each with a distinct feel. Players will likely pick the strategy based on their starting hand, so each game will be unique. There are also a number of tactical card plays available and waiting to be discovered. Agonizing choices, tight economy, and a fascinating balancing act between money versus poverty. As players get familiar with the cards, there may be a risk of scripted play, but this too doesn't seem to be the case. However, there are a number of cards where we wonder "why?", as they seem to serve no useful purpose. I suppose with more plays, the usefulness of these cards and how they interact will become apparent leading to even newer strategies.

This is one of those games that just simply "clicks". So, it is no surprise that it is in the BGG Top 100. A good game that is becoming great, that plays in 90 minutes, scales wonderfully from 2 to 4, with 3 possibly being the sweet spot. 2-player is more like chess, with more turns, more money, and more options. With 4-player, the game could end quickly, if players rifle through the deck for juicy cards. Other than that, I don't see any flaws. Quite popular seeing lots of play. Initial rating a '9', with very likely bump to '10' if re-playability isn't an issue.

Update (09/11/11): There been more than 2 recorded plays, I estimate 20 by now. This is brilliant, brilliant, brilliant. My friends who love Brass love this as well. It scratches the Brass itch in a different, unique, and unexpected way using cards in a novel fashion. Upping to a '10'.

Get. This. Now. 

Update (09/24/11): 3-player clearly gives the best experience in terms of length and tension. 2-player seems to be too open, while the 4-player speeds up the game pace, making specific cards less valuable, and resulting in a less satisfying overall city building experience. A minor quibble--the game can suffer from weak-right-player binding, where due to unfamiliarity with the cards the right-hand player may discard some juicy cards to the benefit of the player to his/her left. It is critical to discern what cards to throw away, as much as what cards to keep--"one man's trash is another man's treasure."

Update (10/10/11): 2-player is yet another totally different experience. There is little or no downtime, so play is quick, yet the game length isn't shortened, since the deck has the same number of cards. Since both players will be able to get more boroughs, this encourages even larger city footprints (number of card stacks), for more dramatic and exciting running of the cities. This becomes a perfect "battle of the wits" game, that doesn't feel deterministic and dry like chess. It isn't quite two-player solitaire either, as there is some interaction through the card discards. The game has many layers of strategy and tactics that may be tried and uncovered over a long period of repeated plays. Highly recommended for two or three players.

Update (11/26/11): A comment was made in that there is some element of luck in the draw of the cards. Yes, if you're lucky enough to draw two omnibuses, that can be devastating to others. Drawing University of London, and drawing Parliament later is surely a death-blow. They can be defeated, but rarely, and surely not in a 2-player game. At a surface glance, it would seem that the game boils down to how many new cards you can draw in search of these premium cards; I don't think it is a problem yet, as it is a legitimate, viable strategy. I'll have to observe more and see if this is a long-term issue.

Update (12/27/11): It seems there is yet another surge of comments that the game is "broken"; I am still not convinced this is the case. The game is about rebuilding London, so this requires buying boroughs. Duh! It is not a question of IF there is an optimal "strategy" of the necessity of buying boroughs; you simply cannot win without going into debt and buying boroughs. I strongly believe that this was the original intention of the designer. If one can get past this misconception, the game is then primarily about the pace, frequency, tempo, and finesse of buying land versus playing cards versus running the city. Ideally, each player will employ different tactics, different building combinations, different card stack sizes (I don't think you want to deviate too far from a one-to-one correspondence of stack-to-borough), different debt sizes, and so on to respond to what is discarded and what is played by the other players, as well as adapt to what is drawn by the player themselves. Also, preparing for the end game is sort of an art form in of itself.

Normally, I dislike card games that require memorization of a lot of cards to play well, such as Glory to Rome or Innovation. Yes, the first game may be a miserable learning experience (like mine was), but I believe the cards' worth are relatively easy to evaluate within a game or two. Perhaps that is why I didn't mind London's card variety at all. 

As for comments about this game being multi-player solitaire, I don't think you can play London in a vacuum. It definitely requires monitoring of the other players' building tableau and discards, which reminds me of "Riich" Mah Jong . In this sense, it has far more "interaction" than Empire Builder, Dominion, or Merchant of Venus. 

Update (04/14/12) 33 plays: In a 4-player game, the player to the right of me "gifted" me with 2x omnibuses. I then proceeded to get 7x boroughs. However, others got the University of London and Parliament, while Public Houses was trashed. I went overboard on getting boroughs, while rapidly depleting the deck. The right-hand player laid a "trap" by giving me those boroughs, and quickly killing the game, leaving me with 9x cards in hand (I managed to whittle down to 4x cards). 3x unpaid loans killed me despite top scores in boroughs and cards. Don't get too greedy, and always monitor how quickly the game can end.

Update (09/29/2013) 44 plays: Still a GREAT game. A number of observations--
1) The relative value and significance of building cards, money generated, VP range, and pace will be vastly different between 2P, 3P, and 4P games.
2) University of London, Parliament, and Public Houses are key buildings, since they allow you to control the pace of the game. but do not necessarily guarantee a win.
3) Seemingly worthless cards can actually be worth a respectable amount of VP, if you consider present cost/total VP gained (taking into account the absolute net value of money, VP, and poverty combined).
4) Small footprint cities (4-6 stacks) usually do not generate enough cash, nor do they have enough inherent VP (brown hex points) accumulated.
5) Large footprint cities (10-12+ stacks) generate lots of cash, have enough inherent VP, but must have a way to control poverty. Duh!
6) Card discards into the common display can make or break the game of your left-handed opponent.
7) Do not be afraid to take loans. However, you must have plans to generate cash during the "C" deck to pay them back. Duh!
8) Perma-buildings (cards that do not flip) are very nice, but don't get too attached to them.
9) Just because you have a lot of boroughs, or a lot of stacks doesn't mean you're going to win.
10) Cards that give you VP chits throughout the game can be significant.
11) Do not be afraid of too much poverty early in the game, but have plans to be relatively even or have less poverty than your opponents by end game. Duh!

A very Wallacian take on the discard a card to play a card genre. The cards feel a little bit on the generic side, most just give you money/vp/poverty reduction and are then turned face down, there's no sense of building an 'engine' here. The secret to success seems to be: grab some Boroughs early on then get down some good cards that don't flip. That's fine as far as it goes, but I don't get a sense of competing strategies, big or small cities, expensive or cheap cards, etc. The theme is pretty good, as is usual for a Wallace game, but I did feel that building the Underground jarred somewhat with everything else. Don't fall behind in the poverty stakes, it's a real vp killer if you do. A year or two ago I would have snapped this up, today I feel that I've got enough of Martin's games, so not a buy for me.

RATING: 8
This is great!  The main questions are how big you want your city to be and how often you're going to run it, but there is a lot to manage between these two things and the cards add a lot of character (I also enjoy the veiled Dickens references).  Despite the fact that all these decisions matter and there are a lot of options available, the game is NOT a heavy one. I'd feared it would be a stressful and terrifying experience like Automobile, but instead it is interesting, engaging, thinky and fun.  Highly recommended.  (1 play)

Clever mechanics inside but many things kills the game. First it is a multiplayer solitaire, too bad. Second, no clear wayS seem to exists to get a little hope to be back in the game (read : if you die, you are very likely to stay dead for the rest of the game). Third, in my last game no one except me borrowed money. Fourth the interest rate of 50% is simply too much especially when combined to the poverty system (you invest, you are likely to kill yourself.. huh ? WTF ? Is that game supposed to be a investment game ?).

Sorry but I do not see a rason to assign more than a 7 for London, rated 5 due to several frustrations hope to raise my rating in the future.

Martin Wallace se sale de su línea habitual al hacer un juego de combos con cartas con tablero, claro y nada intrincado. A algunos les suena a Race for the Galaxy con menos azar y con más gestión que Dominion. Emplea mecanismos conocidos en otros de sus juegos como la gestión de un "recurso negativo" (agua en Tinners, descontento en Struggle... pobreza en London) o la escasez de dinero en Brass y sus préstamos se reproducen aquí en plan "Cofidis" (pide prestados 10 para devolver ¡15!). Su principal mecánica es el descarte como combustible para poner en marcha otras cartas, algo poco novedoso, pero yo no tengo ningún juego así. Pros: sencillo que no simplista para ser de Wallace. Dominion 2.0 ¡sin expansiones! en el que hay más libertad de movimientos y más combos CONTRAS: cartas únicas que hay que conocer muy bien para saber los combos. Poca interacción. Sobreproducido. Precio elevado. Algo de texto de cartas en inglés.

Baja de 8.9 a 7.8 en Oct. 2011 tras la última partida en la que volví a ganar usando la misma estrategia.

After my first play I thought London was a clever game with some interesting mechanics.  After my second play I really started to appreciate the depth of the game.  Despite having a fairly simple rule set and gameplay, London is a shockingly deep and strategic game.  The interplay of money, land, poverty, and your cards leads to some really interesting inflection points (Do I go deeply into debt to build up on land and reduce my poverty?  Do I rapidly expand my City Display to rake in the cash, poverty be damned?), and it's very easy to imagine any one of those strategies being successful.  There is a strong element of multiplayer solitaire but for some reason that doesn't bother me much in this case, perhaps because of the ever-changing Card Display that may give you opportunities to snag great cards a la Thurn & Taxis.  London is a great option when you want a 1 1/2-2 hour game with a lot of meat to it.

London is a very interesting, unique card driven game with lots of theme. There are many interesting choices to be made--when to buy more city districts, when to play cards that provide cash or victory points or reduce poverty. The mechanics work well. My first play was versus two players well experienced in the game so I was at a serious disadvantage--similar to a first time Race for the Galaxy player against experienced players. I enjoy the game and look forward to exploring it further. I like the way the cards are played. I feel like there's quite a bit of race for the galaxy influencing the design--for example, paying to build cards by discarding other cards--yet it is very different in several ways. I recommend London, especially if you like Euro card games and or an appreciation of the city.

London is an interesting and original card-driven game. The artwork is attractive and somewhat evocative of the subject matter but the theme is rather abstracted in the game play itself.

Not a bad game, I enjoyed it while playing and it did keep my interest while playing. Note however after one play I'm pretty sure I seen all it had to offer and feel there is nothing left to explore (unlike something like RFTG) but I liked it despite this and would still play it and refine the little strategy there is.

It does have a couple things in common with Race, things costing cards and building a ‘tableu’ of sorts. VERY easy to learn and to play big pluses here, very little strategy is a big minus, mostly all tactical. Having said that, the game does remain interesting while playing and has a nice short play time, works well for 2 players so I would play again but not something I need to own. The board feels tacked on and mainly to get cards, you do also get points though and it is important to build early to keep poverty in control.  

Overall a decent light weight, likely not worth playing with 4 though I think the game would scale fine.

Edit - Have now played A Few Acres, that is what this game "should have been" and shows how this is just hugely pedestrian in comparison. Its not terrible at all, its just barely mediocre though imho and A Few Acres its a massively improved/upgraded version (with the caveats its only for 2, and the Halifax Hiccup...)

I was excited to finally get this game but after reading the rules I was beginning to think that the game was too simple. Not at all!!!  The rules are straightforward but the cards and the managing of resources are quite complex. Again, it's NOT a hard game to play but there are a LOT of tough decisions throughout the game.  There is nothing I enjoy more than difficult decisions in games. We all thoroughly enjoyed the game even though we knew we needed to play again now that we understood the cards a bit better. I can't wait to play again!  The only reason this is not a ten rating is the sometimes long downtime between turns. As I said, the decisions are sometimes hard and there is a lot to think about.

After opening the box, we wlayed three games in a row, each lasting maybe 75 minutes. We had a blast.

Easy to learn and teach.

Game is challenging and I did worse each time--overcompensating for something I did wrong the previous play.

As card games go this is thematic, but it's not like you're seeing the city grow or anything.

I have special edition #133. I might be willing to part with it for the right price and situation, because I haven't played this in years.

RATING: 7
Get cards to build up a set with useful effects like generating money or reducing poverty or victory points and then activate them when ready.  Then start a new set.  Also buy properties along the Thames to get cards and points but spatial aspect not really that important.  Satisfying but not a real sense of long term planning or coming up with creative strategies.  Just sort of play as you go along.  Not a civ game in the sense of building up, with the exception of a few cards that have continuing effects.  Not even as much building up as Dominion or interesting card effects.  Interesting choices though.

This is a game that you either need a card reference sheet to know what may be available, or you've played a couple times before.  Luck, as could be expected in any card game, can also have a factor.  In my 1st game one player had 2 of the 3 hospitals paired up with a $12 money card so it gave him $36 (same guy I hear in another game had the $12 money card with all 3 hospitals!).  This time however it didn't help him... him and I both had 20 poverty cubes which is -45 points (yes, minus!), I also had 3 loans I couldn't pay off so another -21... I ended up with a negative score :)

Theme loosely based on Monopoly.  Take some cards, put down some cards, some good stuff happens but as a result some bad stuff happens, then you count up the points.  Probably a 6, but a bonus .5 added as it's not as dull as really having to go to London.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (July 2014)

Wallace did it again. London is a good card game and it has a lot of potential to go even higher in my personal ratings. Truth to be told, I didn’t want to play London (not sure why) but I’m glad I did. London is (relatively) easy to teach but has a lot of meaty and interesting decisions each turn (which cards to build, how many buildings in a row, which card do I use to pay, should I get a loan? Should I build in the city? When should I run the city and get poverty?). 

Money is very tight in this game, so knowing when you should stop building or take a loan to build is not a trivial decision.

The game board is very pretty and functional. The poverty concept is great and it functions as another layer you have to consider when thinking about your moves.

When I played London, I felt I was playing Race for the Galaxy. I meant that in the sense that you have to choose which cards to play and which cards to spend, these cards can be then used by your opponents and you again, very tense, very hard. It is great!

I kind of like the theme, but I didn’t feel it much in the game.

I think it is best played with 3 players, with more the downtime begins to be too much for me.

In conclusion, at the present I don’t have anything bad to say about this game. I want to play more soon and I wonder why I haven’t heard much about it.

One of 2010´s favorites.

Uses a number of Martin's familiar devices: the card deck's split into sequential sections a la Liberté, you need to manage 'bad resource' in a similar fashion to Struggle of Empires (poverty in London, unrest in SoE) and money's tight (as it is in pretty much all of Martin's games).

However, this is all applied to  a card game engine similar in someways to San Juan in that you'll have to discard half the cards you draw simply as fuel to allow you to build the other half into your city. Other nice mechanisms include using scarce (at least in the early game) money to purchase sections of London which give you VPs and additional cards, the decision on how often you run your city (do it often and the poverty points could kill you, but leave it late and you'll run out of money), and the bonus points to be had from building the Tube.

And it looks good too - very nice card art.

Some have complained that there are a lot of cards to memorise (the majority of cards are unique) but the cards are largely self explanatory and are generally variations on a small number of themes. It's simpler than many of Martin's games without being simplistic, and doesn't have any of the counter-intuitive mechanisms that can extend the learning curve on some of his games (e.g. Ottomans and Hapsburgs in God's Playground),
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Buying land is an important part:
- it reduces poverty points at each 'run city' and gives VP at the end of the game.
- if you need cards, instead of taking 3 cards, consider buying land. Not only it gives you more cards (up to 5) but also VP.

Try to play with a lot of cards. Like this you have more choice to play better cards. If however you got too many, no problem, just discard them.

RATING: 6
A card driven version of Amun Re designed by Martin Wallace.  The randomness of the cards seemed to cause a lopsided victory, but I think repeat plays would mitigate that somewhat.

Not the best Wallace design and it's far from being my favourite.  It is very repetative... buy cards, run city, buy territory.  It plays a lot like a solitaire game... there is nothing you can do to stop other players from expanding into a new area or performing certain actions.  Wallace's negative victory points show up again here, too... it's a mechanic that has never made sense to me.

After one play, I'll give it a weak 6 rating.

RATING: 7
I like this a lot. Imagine playing Race for the Galaxy, except you get to remake your entire tableau every few turns. The tradeoff is, that the powers on the cards are not nearly as varied as in Race, mostly various combinations of get money or victory points or deal with poverty cubes. So compared to Race it's a tradeoff of less varied cards for the ability to remake the interaction of the cards and see more of them, more often.

The mechanisms interlock very well- drawing a card every turn makes it impossible to build a city where every card doesn't require flipping and play mindlessly to the end- the cards keep coming, which means poverty points are increasing, and you have to add to your city to deal with them. Very nice. The game forces you to adapt as the cards come, just as London was forced to deal with the increasing pressures of a large, industrializing city.

I also love the theme and think the theme is well expressed. But then, I'm working on a PhD in economic history, so if anyone on BGG was predisposed to like this theme, I suppose I was (and that was part of the reason I tried to get a copy). Street lights and sewers lowered the burden of poverty! Monuments are nice (VP) but did little towards running the city. 

This makes me want to try A Few Acres of Snow for another Martin Wallace card-driven board game.

I don't really know if this is considered a city building game or not. It doesn't really feel similar to Suburbia at all (which looks awesome as well), so I don't really know how to categorize it, other than to say it's fantastic. My wife and I love London and its history and this game has tons of nods to buildings and events that fascinate us. The cards you play are so thematic and just make sense. I won't say it feels like you're building London, more like you're taking a tour through London and picking up victory points along the way. It's a strategic game with interesting decisions, rich in theme and just plain awesome.

Card-based game in which London is rebuilt after the Great Fire in three phases and you choose the monuments based on what you can afford. A good exploration of the key elements of one of the world's greatest cities -- but this not an easy game to learn, requiring three or four plays to get the handle of. Our first play ended up with one player collecting negative cards without realizing it!

Card-driven economic game where strangely money seems to get more scarce as you near the game's end, which can leave you holding the bag in multiple ways if you aren't expecting it. The game is solid, with very simple rules. The cards aren't terribly interesting, but they are well-balanced and nicely laid out. The game, especially the special order version, is attractive. I think the card display gives an acceptable amount of control over hand-management. Solid, but not terribly exceptional, game.

Preordered.

From my Essen Watch List (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/58505/johans-essen-2010-watch-list/page/1):

I read the rules last night, and am really tempted to place a preorder. Somewhat simplified it's essentially a card game by the looks of it, but with some board play as well. It seems fairly straightforward: draw a card, then either play a card (possibly paying for it), run your city or draw 3 more cards. 'Running' a city means activating some or all of the cards you've previously played, and the more cards you have the more poverty cubes you end up getting (which gives negative points at the end). One interesting twist is that you can play cards on top of other cards, where only the stack counts towards the poverty cubes, not all the cards in the stack (while cards in the stack still gives points, this does prevent activating the overbuilt cards). The board play seems to amount to allowing you to subsequently play certain other cards, as well as giving an option for more points by having a presence on the board. An added bonus for me is that it works on two players out of the box.

Good solid game, some interesting ideas here (like most Martin Wallace games).  Played alot when the game first came out (Dec. 2010 - Jan. 2011) and probably would have rated it higher (a 7 or 8) then, but these days it doesn't seem to hit the table that much.  I think that, once you are familiar with all the cards, the replay value just isn't there.  There seems to be one kind of set way to play, which is to play cards early for money, then spend it to build districts to keep a check on your poverty, repeat for a few cycles, rinse and dry -- going for points, of course, later in the game.  There are more tactical nuances to the game, but that's about it.

Not as good as Automobile, IMHO.

This has caused some controversy at my club (London on Board), some people (like me) like it, some don't. Main problem people have is that you buy a borough to get cards, play cards to the table, run city, repeat until game ends.

Yes but lots of cards give lots of combinations to try.

A bit disappointing - I had high expectations.  Down time is too great and player interaction too little.  I like building and running the city but the game itself is processional - borough, build, run, borough, build, run, etc etc etc.  I really need to play more with 3 players - 2 players is too boring and 4 is too quick.

Update - 3 players is the sweet spot here.  Its a decent game and quite fun, but no real player interaction except in the race for boroughs.

Update again - played more and rating up to 7.  Works fine with 2 players.

No feel whatsoever about rebuilding London after the great fire... just buy card/VP on the board (don't worry about Loans) and then lay some cards (chosen from the tons os cards you drew), lay down the cards and run the city.
Whilest make the other players desperate when you're discarding, ehehe (good for the morale)

Martin Wallace game that is at its heart a card game, with a small spatial element added. Solid game, feels different than other games I've played: you build up your city, then "run" it, then for the most part you have to move on and do new buildings, never to see your old ones again. There is also a twist of "poverty" that accumulates as your city gets bigger and bigger, and as city manager you have to find ways to combat it. Very entertaining and looking forward to playing again.

RATING: 6
Martin Wallace has built an impressive reputation on unapologetically inelegant and convoluted games. Some are glorious; some are dreadful. Increasingly, his influence is felt elsewhere in the modern design space: Vinhos would be this year's prime example.

London is a stark departure from all that, an easy-to-learn, tableau-style card game that answers the challenge laid down by San Juan, Race for the Galaxy, and Glory to Rome, as well as newcomers Gosu, 51st State, and Innovation. A turn is simple: either play new cards, activate old cards, or draw more cards (mostly by claiming regions on the board). The deck is simple: three suits with mostly straightforward functions. Brown cards generate cash; pink cards generate victory points, blue cards mostly help reduce poverty. The cost to play a new card is consistent across the deck and throughout each phase of the game: simply discard a card of that color to the board display. Only the cost to activate cards varies much. Interaction between players is gentle, mild, and indirect, probably moreso than any other game I've ever played.

London has been described in my game group as "relaxing," and really, if you know anything about Wallace's previous titles, that tells you all you need to know about what a strange experience this is. It's "fine," it "works," it's "playable," etc., but I won't be going out of my way to explore it further.

This is a deeper game, but the rules aren't overly complex and it can be played in under two hours. Select the cards from the stack or ones that other players have discarded face up. Build your economy by playing cards. Don't build too many or have too many in your hand when you do or you go into poverty. Buying sections of the city helps prevent the poverty. I found it usually better to take from the random stack since players tend to discard the weakest cards. I like this game.

1. No face up duplicate buildings allowed in a single player's city display. Building something, flipping it, then building the same card again later is allowed. 
2. When a player expends a card forcing a clearing of a row in the card display, that player places a neutral marker of a third colour in a city borough of their choice. The appropriate number of cards based on that borough are drawn from the deck and immediately discarded.

The combo aspect is not as strong as I expected on first play which makes London more accessible for me. It's rather a game of timing money vs VP acquisition, relative positioning with regard to poverty tokens and hand management. While the two-player game is less tight it's probably my favourite due to the reduced downtime.
---
Martin Wallace does a card combo game. Not exactly, what I was looking for but enough folks will enjoy it. London is another prove that card combo building doesn't work for me. It's more enjoyable than Friese's parallely released take at this genre, Fürstenfeld, and I would play London again. But as usual I don't have a clue why my combos don't work as efficiently as others. I don't have the experience of Magic players in immediately recognizing good combinations and I don't have the interest in learning all the cards to play better. Too many games with better return on investment out there. London is a bit too long for the fun provided. After half the deck I wouldn't have minded an immediate end. I'm glad that I wasn't the only clueless around as until the final scoring it wasn't clear to any of us who'll win. Or what to do better next time.
As with all Wallace games, here's the part on quirky design decisions: The game doesn't scale between players. With the full complement of four players the burroughs will have been bought in mid-game. Players have less actions to choose from, the tension drops. Tinners' Trail had the same problem and therefore was best with three players.

The city building mechanic is cool, but I'm not convinced the engine building theme really works. The city engine is usually only run a handful of times; it is hard to control what cards you get; timing of key moments (when to run city, when to end game) is exceptionally difficult if not impossible.

The only thing separating London from the stream of mediocre combo-building card games is the basically unnecessary game board and the higher price tag. Other than that it doesn't really add anything to the genre, and doesn't even feel like a particularly good execution of the typical ideas.

The gameplay feels sluggish and the interaction is indirect enough (through the discard pile) to be non-existent.

I guess the one thing it has going for it is a strong theme.

Got a few plays out of it, but ultimately it is not convincing or varied enough to last over the long term.  The big problem is that the cards are too similar with only very minor differences.  This makes the decisions seem (though I admit they probably are not) trivial.  Also, it seems like buying boroughs is an absolute necessity, and you cannot compete if you decide to let everyone else buy up the board.  This leads to a highly tedious and quite honestly ridiculous series of picking up tons of cards and then discarding them.  A good chunk of the game is spent fine tuning your hand, discarding stuff and waiting for others to discard stuff.  This feels completely against the spirit of the game, but I don't see any way around it.

RATING: 7.5
Its interesting in an "oh my god we're all drowning in poverty and we can't get out" type of way. I really enjoyed the feeling of struggling against an unforgiving system (much like you do in Le Havre).

Thematically though, the game is dry. Very symbol-based and a little bit boring in terms of the cards. Also the map with the boroughs seem a bit wasted in terms of potential. All you do is drop your marker on the board and thats it. I think this is a pretty good game, but I would like to see how replayable it is after a few plays.

Limited edition #253 of #1000 signed. The wooden properties are great.
Very well thought out game.  It is mostly a card game, but the map of London is still an important piece of the big picture.  I don't believe I would enjoy it nearly as much with just the cards.  Multiple plays are necessary before you will be able to have a coherent strategy from the beginning.

Thematically a great game. I love how the cards and the artwork evoke the history of London and just the feeling to be there as well.
Although Wallace said and it is right that every card has a good use and every card is valuable, there is an inbalance in the cards.

London reminds me somewhat of Liberté with its age decks and card displays. This time the displays have been refined quite a bit and the gameplay is smoother and more about the cards than in Liberté. Board is really just an extension to card play. For a Martin Wallace game I see London as fast flowing and even quick. The theme is nice and well implemented and there's more interaction than you can see at first. Luck of card drawing may bother some, but the nature of the game is purely tactical and it's about timing your actions right and grabbing the opportunities. The starting player unfortunately has a bit of an advantage and there is no balancing mechanism.

RATING: 9
London's cards are simple: you have money, territories, cards, and poverty to manage, and so cards give or cost some of these. There are very few cards with powers which can't fit on icons and be described as a simple +X or -Y. That being said, the poverty mechanism still leads to a rich game, and the powers' simplicity makes the game very fast-paced.

Good engine building game that lives on the though decisions you'll be making.
Very big downside: really needs 3+ players. Otherwise a rather essential part of the game (the area control) is kinda borked.

Game is nicely thematic. The colours on the cards are clear but kind of ugly.

RATING: 6
I've heard a lot of people bellyache about this game, and I don't for the life of me understand why.

Most of the time you end up trying to turn a sow's ear into a silk purse. Loans are particularly punishing (Hello, Mister Wallace!), and the Very Special Lose Veeps at the End Condition (poverty) can be nasty if you don't really work at unimpoverishing your Dickensian masses. 

I like how there's a real sense of history and growth here. Before playing, it was hard to imagine how Martin Wallace would do with a predominantly card-based design, but this is exactly what I would've pictured, and it works very well. I can imagine burning out on it after eight or ten plays, once you've seen every combo and can ferret out the good ones, but until then I probably won't turn down a game if it's on offer.

UPDATE: I find this to be too long for two, even with variants. It's fun but a clunky one.

Based on one three-player game.  Interesting game.  I like the aspect of gathering different cards and building your engine.  Stressful trying to figure out what to do each turn.  This game could be fun if played many times and regularly in order to know the cards and work at the game.  But I don't quite feel the urge to delve into this one.  I'm interested in playing this again but don't have the desire to own it.

RATING: 6
A decent game with interesting mechanics, but with a terrible punishment for drawing the last cards and ending the game, leading to a game that generally forces the players to stall and attempt to not end the game.  For me, the game was interesting for about 2/3 of the turns and then just seemed to stagnate and get repetitive, right about the time the land was all purchased.  Also, as described above, the game punishes anyone who tries to end the game early by forcing that player to keep all the cards he just drew to end the game as poverty (negative points) in hand, rather than giving the person who ended the game another turn and a chance to at least dump the cards.

I waffled on whether to get this game.  I ended up buying it as I never had a chance to try it beforehand.  After one play I let it go.

For me London fell into that uncomfortable "pretty good, but not great" zone.  With only mildly good reactions from my regular opponents, I decided to pass it on to a friend.

I would play again if requested.  But it was not a game I anticipated ever requesting.

Played with two and it works great, three and four I'm sure is just as balanced because the deck doesn't actually run out faster because more cards can go in the display, giving everyone more choices to take cards from.

[b]My thoughts[/b]:
Love how the game is balanced between spending/saving money, playing/drawing cards, and building buildings/activating cards. The poverty level is intimidating but always seems to decrease steadily throughout the game, but if you spend all your time on correcting that you'll be broke by the end and have lots of loans you cannot pay off. A game of scarcity, which I am indeed a fan of (just like Notre Dame).

I had to downgrade my rating to a 7. While the gameplay is interesting I down't know at all if I'm rebuilding London.

Also it becomes pretty clear that you have to build a lot of property early on. 

so start is scripted.

-Build on the map
-Build on your building display
-Run city
-Build on the map
-Build on the map or on building display
-Run city

And it continues like that.
It can feel like you have many options but in reality you don't.

The strategy became apparent in my second game.
One player was struggling with the order to execute stuff.
The other followed an agressive loan strategy and picked mostly from the draw deck. Since no penalties are given for exceeding a hand of nine he got a lot of good cards which cemented his lead.

I would like to like this one more, because the card mechanism AND how they bring you negative "shit" is good. BUT the big issue here is that you need to wait too much before it's your turn again. The reason for that, is that couple of key elements in London are 'playing cards' and 'executing cards' which both takes significant time to resolve and when resolving those actions means that card display and board can change a lot just before it's your turn. And that means, that next player has to think his action again... So, this why such a low rating.

I like London quite a bit.  I think it's sort of like a more complex San Juan.  Sort of automatic play once you've played a few times, with different cards and buildings, it's fun to see what happens and how it comes out.  Can be a brainburner while planning the best way to build your hand, which cards to use.  I like the variety and the different ways you can make VPs.  Although I seem to usually always end up with the exact same score, just in different areas.  Weird.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
First, let me state that I think Martin Wallace has hit upon another really wonderful board/card game system.  I can see this design system becoming as popular as Age of Steam (which I'm a big fan of).  I do think this game, published as is, does need a little more fine tuning (or at least to my taste) and needs more work in balancing cards/buildings relative to the rest of the cards in the deck.  In my opinion, there should also be cards relative to or scaled to the number of players.

I think this is a really good card drafting and card combination (CCG-like) game where players are utilizing cards to make businesses/buildings in London while buying land to help develop London.  The keys are card management and running your city and maintaining a level of poverty that maximizes your victory points strategy. There's lots of choices here with several strategies to adapt and lots of card combinations to pursue.  

This seems to be a good for two and three players.  The game, nor the rules, allow for scaling for two versus three versus four players, which I would have greatly preferred.  With 3 or 4, I wished there were more cards added that were labeled for use/added during 3 or 4 players.  Also, I firmly believe that the "University of London" card is simply too powerful (and under-priced) and only one-of-a-kind.  I think it should just be ignored from the game or replaced as a gray card or shuffled into Deck C.

I do really hope that there will be expansion decks available in the future.  This system can work wonderfully with different maps as well with a card themes adjusted to the map according (for example, expansions could be New York, Los Angeles, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Paris, Munich, and so on).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Initial impression quite favorable after one play.

LIKES:

* Cards have very interesting combinations in how they work together.
* The way poverty interacts with your cards stacks/cards in hand brings an interesting piece that you must manage well in the game.
* Money is tight in the end game - be careful not to spend all your money and find out you don't have enough to pay back your loan (which results in -7 points per loan!).  
* Purchase districts in the city to help manage the poverty level and earn VPs on the board and draw cards.
* I also enjoy the tension between buying districts and drawing cards, playing city cards, and as mentioned before the interaction with poverty.

DISLIKE:

* The end game can become a bit stale as it drags on around the table until someone feels like they are at a good place to either end the game or have to end it.  Be sure you are prepared to deal with the possible consequences of the end game!
* I have significant concerns about the replayability of this game.  I'm also not certain if there is much variability to how one can play this game successfully, but time will tell.

Bit conflicted on this one.

On one hand, its highly thematic, I love the scenery of London, and I think the mechanics with the poverty combating a super tableau are kind of nifty.

On another hand, with repeated plays, this game kind of turns into a self-playing machine where certain cards get played and others ignored...so replays suffer.

Overall though, its not a game I will part with. Usually up for it every 3 months or so.

My wife and I tend to like tableau-building card games, such as games like [thing=8217][/thing], [thing=28143][/thing], and [thing=19857][/thing].  It's fun to try and build up your area as well as trying to make use of all the special actions on the cards.  As a result, we've been interested in [thing=65781][/thing] for a while, as it seemed like an evolution on these types of games.  Luckily, our Secret Santa gifted us a copy of this for the new year and we eagerly tried it out.

I was an immediate fan of the artwork.  The map design and the card art just felt very classy.  I liked the introduction of the poverty mechanic as a thematic way of subtly limiting your tableau.  The fact that most cards could only be used once before being flipped over was interesting as well, so you had to pick the right timing to run your city.  The card display, reminiscent of [thing=9217][/thing], felt like it could provide some options for player interaction---what cards do you leave there?  When do you try to pick them up?

We ended up using the [thread=621605]Ben-Luca variation[/thread] recommended on the forums and got started.  This helped make the game feel tighter for two players.  However, there are some design oversights that annoyed us.  It would have been [i]much[/i] simpler to have a score track instead of going through and counting all of your cards and boroughs at the end.  Most of the points are open anyway, so that would have saved a lot of time.  I wish there was an easier way to sort the cards back to the phase 1, 2, and 3 decks afterwards as well.  In terms of gameplay, the timing of when to run your city didn't feel as interesting as I had hoped.  Since you turn over, or inactivate, many of your cards when you run the city, the game feels less like a steady engine builder and feels more like trying to time different waves of action.  In addition, the map felt fairly irrelevant---although there are a few cards that make use of the map, it didn't feel very critical to the game.  The card display didn't feel very interactive---in fact, my wife commented that this felt too "multiplayer solitaire" even for her.

In the end, although there were some new ideas here, there was really nothing in [thing=65781][/thing] that we couldn't get out of something like [thing=28143][/thing], especially in a fraction of the time.  Still, it's a game that I probably admire more than I like...

In the wake of Race for the Galaxy and Dominion, resource management card games are all the rage and London is Martin Wallace’s entry into the genre. Nominally about the reconstruction of London after the great fire of 1666, London mixes things up a bit by having a gameboard featuring a map of city districts that the players can claim, rather than being a straight-up card game.

Nevertheless, the heart of the game lies in the cards. You play buildings from your which do nothing until you “run your city,” at which point all your face up cards do that thing they do. Those things include generating money, generating victory points, preventing poverty (which is damaging, but only at the end of the game) plus a few other special powers here and there. Some cards require an additional price to activate – although the most common price of discarding a card from your hand can be quite beneficial – and most are one-use-only, so you flip them face down after you activate them.

The catch is that there is tension between wanting to play as many buildings as possible and playing them in small numbers. Cards are played into stacks, and when you run your city you can only activate the top card in each stack (provided it is face up). You can build over other cards keeping things under control and you don’t want to create stacks willy-nilly because each stack generates a poverty point (whether you activate its top card or not) when you run your city. You also generate one poverty for each card you have in hand when you run your city, though, so hoarding cards for your next go round has a cost as well.

At the end of the game you tote up your VPs from buildings constructed (including those buried in the depths of your stacks), VP chits earned, the city districts you have claimed and money on hand, with a penalty for poverty which depends on how much worse you are than the player who best kept their poverty under control.

Overall I enjoyed playing London, but I’m not sure yet whether it has legs. There are some issues with card balance (already there seems to be a consensus that one player getting both Omnibuses is a gamebreaker, something I experienced in my game) and I don’t think the low poverty strategy is as viable as one would hope because of a flood of strong poverty-control buildings in the late stages of the game. On a personal taste front, I wish there were more cards that stayed around for more than one run to add a bit more strategy (versus working with what you’ve got), possibly including cards that you could pay an additional price (or accept diminished returns from) to keep in play. Also, I’d want a significant reduction in playing time once you’re familiar with the game (three of the four players in my game were first-timers). It feels like a 60 minute game, but the learning curve makes your first game likely to run to 90+ minutes.

I am definitely up for playing more to see how some of those “what ifs” resolve, though. If enough things fall on the right side of the line, London promises to be a rewarding mildly-strategic resource management card game, in the same vein as Saint Petersburg if a bit heavier.

One of my favorite card games. The common discard/pickup area offsets the huge randomness involved in a lot of other cards games, which for games of this length (60-90 minutes) really matters.

In my mind this is Wallace's take on RftG; not an entirely bad thing.

As a whole I have no issues with the design itself. The cards work well. The cards, while basic, blend together seamlessly with no "dead" ones in the mix. I even like the discard area and the player driven timer that it represents.

The game is, however, completely unintuitive and dare I say totally counter intuitive. This in combination with the classic unforgiving Wallace design sense in which there are usually few chances to catch up created a very frustrating and skewed-scoring first play.

Willing to play at least one more time to decide how disappointed I really am.

Update:

Play number two with two major changes:

1 - It's amazing how much better the game plays when you have the rules correct and play more than one card per "play cards" action.

2 - Everyone took loans. Another massive improvement and removed many barriers in the game's economy.

Those being said the game was wonderful, tense, highly competitive, and thoroughly enjoyable.

My rating rises from a 6 to an 8.

An card game where you are paying to put cards out in front of you.  When you put the cards out, you eventually can "run" your city and resolve cards that once run may stay out permanently and some you flip over and don't use them. Each card you play to your city creates a "stack" which will cost you at the end of a century with these poverty tokens.  You can also buy land in the city which will allow you to develop subways later.  

An excellent game where you try to expand but balance against poverty.

I have mixed feelings about this game.  I feel that there is definitely an optimal pattern for play, and most of the decisions are just what order to play the cards.  I do think that the decisions revolving around which cards to play and which cards to use for payment are fairly agonizing.

RATING: 8
I seem to be good at this game, which obviously makes me more inclined to rate it highly. The mechanics of the game are simple enough that the game is easy to teach, but there's still a good bit of thinking involved in each turn. There's lots of different things to balance, and while it's occasionally obvious what the best move on a given turn is, there are plenty of times where the decisions are delightfully agonizing.

The artwork suits the theme, and the game pieces are all of a good standard, although the plastic coins are too small and thin to not be fiddly, and I'd have preferred some cardboard tokens instead.

[Played a few times]

Nice card game, albeit quite solitair-ish.
Management of cards, money and poverty feels well mixed.

Unfortunately, it feels flawed with few players (too easy to manage poverty, too long given the essentialy repetitive sequence of actions, dominant strategy "take loan, buy land early") and also with many (lack of interaction, downtime in spades).

Unbalanced cards (for no real reason) are the bitter icing.

A Wallace card game with simple rules and gameplay. As with every Wallace, thematically (and historically) brilliant. 

Minus: It is a pretty solitary game, since your are collecting and playing cards that will bring you the most points and least poverty. So you don't know how you are doing until the very end, when points are counted. 

Minus: 3 (interaction) - 4

RATING: 5
Yet another interesting Martin Wallace prototype that somebody mistook for a finished and publishable game. The main problem apart from unnecessarily unbalanced card (especially for the starting cards, which leads to escalating effects over the whole game) is the length of the whole affair.

The rating is for the three-player game; with two it might even approach the enjoyable. With four it would probably be quite horrible, but I'll make damn sure that I'll never be in a position to find out.

What appears to be a pretty straight-forward game ends up scorching your brain in the typical Martin Wallace-fashion. Essentially a card game with economic and poverty management. Starting off with a 7 after one play. The end game seemed a bit muddled. Not sure.

UPDATE (9.21.11) - Played with 4 players, two who were new to the game. Downtime was a bit of an issues, but that may have been due to the newer players getting up to speed on the mechanics. I think this game is very clever and has a lot of very cool mechanics. I suspect with multiple plays and better knowledge of the cards this game would really shine with 2 to 3 players. I bumped it up to an 8 and will probably purchase, because I think my wife might enjoy the game.

RATING: 8
Martin Wallace is a prolific designer with a strong fan base and famous for his relatively complex (at least as far as finding the optimum stategy is concerned) historical and economic board games. London has some key elements of Wallace’s designs, such as tight economic system (once again a loan is inevitable), but on the other hand it is a very simple game to learn and play in comparison to what we are used to.

In my turn, I draw one card (from the display or common deck) and then I have one action to choose between play cards from my hand, draw 3 cards, run city or buy land. At the end of my turn I have to discard down to 9 cards.

Cards represent buildings and locations of London and provides us with money and VPs and also affect poverty, but some of them also have special abilities. When I play cards, I place them in fron of me in stacks and for each card played I have to place a card of the same color on the display, which is therefore available from any player to draw it later. Each time I take the “Run city” action, cards that I have played already in front of me are being activated (most of them once per game) and then I take poverty cubes for each stack of cards I have and for each card in my hand minus one for each property I own in London map. Poverty is important because can cost a lot of VPs at the end of the game. When I “buy land”, I pay the cost depicted on the board, draw as many cards as indicated on this location and mark it with my token. These properties are important because decrease poverty, worth VPs and are related to many cards.

The game ends as far as the deck is depleted, followed by one last turn and players count VPs (cards played with VP on them, VP tokens accumulated previously by run city actions, 1 VP per 3 money, VPs from properties, minus poverty penalty and 7 VP per unpaid loan).

So, the game flows well, it is an enjoyable game, but where is the catch? There is a standard strategy that you have to follow: Take loans, buy as many land as you can early in order to limit your poverty. Then later you can run city without taking poverty. If a player follows this strategy, then others should follow if they want to have chances for victory. You draw many cards this way that most of them have to be discarded. I don’t like this because many cards (about 40% – 50% of deck)are discarded without being played. But all in all is still a good game. Maybe too mainstream for Wallace’ fans (count me in) but London will appeal casual players who run away when Wallace’s games hit the table. If you like drafting, probably you will like this game.

RATING: 7
This could be a great game. Unfortunately it's not. The main problem is that loans are very cheap. Thus, you can manipulate this "bug" by getting a loan(s) and buy land. The other players have to follow the same strategy and after that there isn't much of a game left. 

So, in order to make it work as a game, you absolutely need house rules. I have tried a lot of them - some work better than others:
#1. Loans are more expensive both in money and VPs
#2. Remove some building tokens depending on the number of players (e.g. for 2 players, each player has 8 tokens, for 3 players 7 tokens, for 4 players 5 tokens)
#3. You can't buy land, if you start your turn with 9 cards OR you can't get a loan, if you start your turn with 9 cards
#4. You can't have two same cards simultaneously in your city (e.g. 2 omnibus)
#5. Getting a loan is 1 action
#6. You can buy a specific number of boroughs in each step (A-2, B-3 and C-5)
#7. For each card you have to discard above your hand limit when you buy a borough, you take 1 poverty cube
#8. Each time you buy a borough and you have an outstanding loan, you must pay some interest (e.g. 5 pounds). If you take a new loan, you must first pay off your previous one. 

I prefer #6, #7 and #8.

I've only played this game two player, but it felt broken to us. The person who won was the one who got the money production cards early (thus allowing them to produce enough money to pay to run/build more expensive cards and buy boroughs). That could simply be called a dominant strategy, until you factor in that this is a card game where luck of the draw has a huge influence on who gets those cards. Someone could hold a monopoly on them. That's what happened in both our games. The winner was different each time, but both times, the winner won because of that luck of the draw. That made the game feel very unsatisfying for us, especially considering how long it is. We weren't interested in ever playing it again.

Oooh, this is a neat game. Lots of moving parts with low complexity, turn angst almost every turn, a pleasant amount of interaction, and the constant feeling that the theme and mechanics are talking to each other -- over the course of the game, you really feel the competing pressures of the city, and the March of history is nicely conveyed.

I love that every component in the game is something that counts for or against you at the end. The game is a balancing act, and I often wonder if I'm making the best choice or missing a sweet spot, which makes for delicious tension. Its also fantastic with two.

Lovely game, but one that because of the card combinations, familiarity is a must to fully appreciate what it has to offer. After 1 play, I would rate it at a 8. Considering that Martin Wallace is my favorite designer, this rating will likely go up with future plays.

Update 2/1/15: 

Better than I remembered, still an 8 though. Erin and I played this last night. I got killed, but had a good time. The collector's edition (newly acquired) is quite nice with the wooden buildings. I love the Ssn Juan/Glory to Rome--pay a card to use a card element. I love the historical integration, and I love the production values. This game doesn't have a "fun" feel necessarily, but it does have a very enjoyable feel, if that makes sense. London is a keeper for sure!

RATING: 6.06
Wasn't impressed in a video review and playing it changed nothing. I don't know if you can win or not doing it, but I don't think you have to run your city. If you don't, there pretty much becomes zero tension in the game. It's basically taking San Juan, adding poverty, and changing up enough mechanics to further separate it. I would just rather play San Juan since it's far more cohesively done. Part of me wants to play it more so I can further wrap my brain around it to full understand the mechanics and limitations, but that requires playing a game I deem unfun. The fact that it currently threatens the Top 100 befuddles me.

Mentally walked though the idea that you really likely do need to run your city so that helps the game so that spun it in a more positive light. Boosted rating since I would rather play it than Settlers. It would benefit with a short play time. Again, San Juan does its job and in half the time.

Played DaveCon 2012.

Rating Potential: 6.5-7.5 It would take a lot of favorable plays to get it to 7.5 though. I can maybe see 7. There just seems to be a lot of well known games I would put in the 7 range, and I just don't see what makes this game stand out from the others.

Birthday gift: May 2012

As of May, 2012:
Played once with 4 at Great Lakes Games and twice with 2.

I think I'll try the Ben-ZenLuca variant next time when playing with 2.  The rush to build, build, build searching the deck for good cards is just too mechanical.  Last time I played I ended up with three Hospitals, 3 Undergrounds, and several high dollar cards that quickly paid off my loans I took early in the game to build 10 districts (by game end - I had 2 loans).  But I ended up running all 3 Undergrounds and still ended up with 19 points in just money left over by game end (101 points total).  We both had an Omnibus showing.

Seems to need something else to heighten the poverty tension when only two are playing.  Ban the double Omnibus! :-)

Sold Sept, 2015 due to lack of play time.

Finally played this with the wife, I may have a new favorite. This has a good tradeoff between dong what you need to to make money while trying to fend off poverty.

Played two-player.  I definitely think it would be better with fewer regions available, no duplicate cards allowed at the same time, and possibly starting with more than 5 poverty.  It sounds like we need to try the Ben Luca variant.

Played again three-player. Much better than two player as poverty is truly a factor and can be hard to get rid of. I also like that you can win with or without poverty.

Another great Wallace which is somewhat light.  There is much to like with this one.  For one, the art is up to par with and I must confess that I find that M. Wallace is becoming more and more good in choosing it's in-game art.

The mechanism is clever and I grabbed it soon enough without it being very clear at first sight.

I think it's a bit more complicated than Tiner's Trail but not very much.

In the first 30 minutes I rated it a 9.
The next 30 minutes a 6 and the last 30 minutes a 2.The reason is that the endgame does not give the player ending the game another turn. Therefore the game drags on and on. For me its really a disappointment, but Ilikethe basic mechanism and the beautiful cards.

Only small conflicts with the other players in terms of card interaction and board position so my wife enjoyed it. I lost my first game in my final turn by making a small mistake (93 to 90) and then I proceeded to lose three more times.  I can't find a sweet spot for my burroughs strategy.

* For this gamers money, Wallace's best design (and yes, I've tried other games by him)
* The strategy behind which cards to play and when to run your city is very enjoyable
* Just the right amount of complexity to feel meaty, but not too much to burn the brain
* As entire deck of cards will be exhausted each game, may have some replay value problems
* Good for those who like building something and seeing it perform

London is another strongly themed game from Martin Wallace. Players take turns in either playing cards (which represent buildings/ institutions) to their building display, or claim land in a borough or 'run' their city (by activating their played cards). Like most MW games there are lots of difficult decisions to make. Players have to generate cash, earn victory points, claim land and minimise the amount of poverty that builds up. This is essentially a card game with simple rules (no more complex than Tinner's Trail).

I guess this game does what it's supposed to. It's a pretty relaxed card drafting game that doesn't stack up well against its peers. Glory to Rome, while not a card drafting game, is loosely related thematically and far more dynamic and interesting, while taking less time to play. Even 7 Wonders wins, being about as interesting while taking a fraction of the time. Decisions aren't super tough; you're just coasting along, doing the best you can with the cards you're given. Initial plays take way too long, but, once players know the game (i.e., prioritize getting boroughs), it goes a lot faster. I'm okay with playing it again, but certainly don't need to own it.

London is Martin Wallace's take on the efficiency engine card game genre dominated by greats like Race for the Galaxy, Through the Ages, Glory to Rome, and the relatively unknown 51st State / The New Era and now forgotten Saint Petersburg. It's relatively straightforward as a member of this genre, being built mostly around the income / VP tradeoff central to these sorts of games and around Martin Wallace's trademarked focus on loans. It reuses bits and pieces of the pay-to-play mechanism and consumption phase [even the same "goods" icon!] from Race. Some cards give you infrastructure, others give you weird special powers, still others let you start burning the midnight oil in your engine to crank out the points. Lather, rinse, repeat and you're all done.

What it does very interestingly is place a limits-to-growth system on your engine-building in an organic way. The system is kind of like the Happiness mechanism in Through The Ages, but is much more explicitly linked to the engine-building. The central idea is that every time you "turn the crank", you effectively incur a cost / penalty based on how many cards make up your engine. To allow you to manage this, you're able to "stack" cards on top of each other; so, as you gain access to more efficient cube-churners, you can replace your old technology, etc. Thematically, the cost is dubbed "poverty" and the more you accumulate during the game, the more penalty points you will have to pay at the end of the game based on an increasing scale.

There are, of course, cards that give you the ability to reduce your recurring penalty or eliminate previously earned poverty. Effectively, the entire poverty system is one of managing administrative / overhead / fixed expenses, and it works quite well without the clunkiness of something like Through The Ages' maintenance phase or the tacked-on feeling of the more usual "feed your workers" phase in most larger efficiency engine board games. The penalty is directly tied to your efficiency, allowing you to make interesting opportunity cost decisions; you can clearly see what adding a new stack will do to your costs, and judge that against the expected gain to see if you'll net a profit or a loss. It's a decision type that is usually absent from games like this; in Race, if you have a good card and can pay the start-up fee, you just play it.

Where the game kind of falls short, and feels most strange, is that most of the cards you play down only activate one time and then effectively leave your tableau [they get flipped over, in reverse-Brass fashion]. You're left with the overhead, but not the output. This means you have to keep struggling to piece together new parts of the engine to manage the cost structure you've set up. It feels very weird, and is almost wholly unlike any other game in this genre I can think of. 51st State / New Era comes closest in that there is a hard 3-use limit on VP-producing cards, but that is nowhere near as game-defining. Martin Wallace seems to enjoy this thematic representation of growth by removing from play the source of the economic gain once used [see the new income structure in Age of Industry or the oft-confusing thematic interpretation of deliveries in Age of Steam], but it makes his games feel herky-jerky and this is no exception.

UPDATE: A second play, and the game continues to please. But several criticisms are also valid: the multiplarer solitaire of it, the downtime, and perhaps the lack of any long-range strategy. But since I still want to play and teach it, why quibble?

RATING: 9
I had convinced myself that I didn't need London, considering it was out of print and didn't seem all that innovative. Surprisingly, it turned out to be a perfect example of Wallace doing what he does best, which is presenting a simple rule set with a ton of depth. I tend to love games of his like this, such as Steam and Brass, where learning the game isn't difficult, but doing well is an entirely different story.

In a lot of ways, this feels like Wallace doing his own version of Race for the Galaxy/San Juan. The map element here is one I like, though the Poverty element is one that constantly keeps players on their toes. It's slightly reminiscent of corruption in other games like Lords of Waterdeep, but here it's far more punishing and difficult to get rid of. I really like the tenseness that it creates.

My initial research was correct; there isn't anything all that innovative here. The design itself, however, is one that I very much enjoy. It's a game of building a tableau of cards, but there's a certain balance and rhythm you have to maintain in order to do well. I know this game gets mixed reviews from people, but I believe it's one of Martin Wallace's best works.

Great quick card game from Mr. Wallace. Miles away from 7 wonders. Much more deep and strategic. A great one hour light game. It misses of interaction,it's a multi-player solitaire but flows very well.
It worth to keep exploring. 
Wallace is reaching for other markets now and is accomplishing his goals.

Thorougly enjoy this Wallace game, a distant cousin of Discworld: Ankh-Morpork.  The theme works well, and it plays excitingly with two, although be prepared for a long sitting.  Watching the city grow in the tableau is genuinely involving, especially if, like me, you know the city and its history well.

The rules are simple to pick up, but the decisions are deep and complex, and it hits the spot for me pretty much exactly.  Lovely cards and board and a real sense of history, but boo hiss to the horrid money tokens which are a pain.

A game of card management, in RFTG style. The rule is simple, and there is plenty of decisions to make. I like it especially in four players as the supposed "dominant strategy" mentioned by lots of people actually become less prominent. 

While I like card game in general, this gives me an impression that it can be "solved", as I feel that some cards are just better than the others. I need to play a few more time to see if that's true.

RATING: 9
One is attempting to rebuild London from the fire of 1666, in this card driven game. One either plays cards, activates cards, buy boroughs or draw three cards as their action. After you activate cards, some get flipped over, never to be used again, while some stay permanent. 

Money is very tight, and you can take loans when you need money. You can also accumulate poverty tokens from the cards or activating cards, so one also has to worry about reducing their poverty tokens, as at the end of the game, they reduce your score.

This is Martin Wallace's best game to date. The rules are simple, and the stacking of cards is a pretty neat mechanic. I really enjoy this game, and want to play this a ton more.

A structured multi-player solitaire card game with a restrictive engine building. Still, better than the overproduced 7 Wonders as there is much more to do and is also better than Dominion as there is more depth to it and no endless wretched shuffling.

First play, missed a crucial bit in the rules (which should have been included in a different section, IMO) which broke the game.  Pulled ourselves together and gave it another shot and there's something really special here.  Card management to (a) minimize negative points, (b) hold back your opponents (who can use your discards for their own actions) and (c) "build" a functioning city.  Great, balanced, interesting design.

First impression (4 players): Like in all games with plenty of different (almost) unique cards it's hard to say how balanced those are.

Really enjoy the core mechanics of this game -- especially setting up and then "running" your city.  I wish there was a little more player interaction, although I imagine with more plays, I'll become more aware of how manipulating the tableau affects other players.  (In short, cards you discard, usually to build in your city, become available to other players.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A real niche-filler. Somewhere between being long and political and being short and uncontrollable, lies London. It's a glorious exercise with just one variable more than you would like to keep under control and - of course - particularly apt to denizens of the city itself. Not RftG-esque, as others have claimed, the key management and timing strategies make it closer to Dominion, or even Carcassonne. The artwork is sheer class and the game wouldn't be the same without it.

Further Thoughts: the big issue starting to arise with this is the amount of downtime. You could go walk the dog and cook dinner in the amount of time it takes for three opponents all to run their cities. Above this, there's a bit of a question over whether the game is just playing itself. Downgraded from 9 to 8.

Further, Further Thoughts: Down again, to 7.5. The game is totally immersive, and I love that. But we've seen it all now, and in under ten plays. Shame.

A card optimization game with a nice theme.  Game play is solo multi player.  With almost no interaction between players.  Basically, pick the best cards available and play them.  The strategy is to optimize the cards for the most VP, but it's pretty fun to pursue different routes to victory.  After 20 plays, I'm ready to move on and probably won't ever play this game again, unless someone asks to, or if a wax nostalgic for it.

Random card draws can bring this game down. Need to try it with highest player count.

I highly recommend drafting the first hand of cards and then playing from there. That way it's less likely for a player to get the lucky early jump that rolls into a landslide victory.

This game is quite good - its a relatively casual puzzle game, where you are balancing growth and stability (poverty);  like many games, you play cards in front of you as a tableau - these cards are buildings that usually have some kind of special ability and/or point value;  ideally, you want to build things that work well with each other, or provide benefits which will help you grow further;

however, the more buildings you have, the more expensive it is to run your city, so you have to manage growth carefully;  also, you are penalized for keeping a large hand size, but too small a hand size presents you with little options - so timing when or how to play your cards is critical; if you play or activate your cards at the wrong time, it will be inefficient, to say the least

Some other features:

1.  there is little player interaction

2.  there is a bit of luck, but it seems especially manageable;  I never felt the cards were screwing me over

3.  game weight is about a 2.5 out of 5.0, maybe even a little lower

4.  the game will easily take the recommended 90 mins

5.  great as a two player game, especially if using the variant proposed here on BGG

[i]Not sure where I stand with this one. I enjoyed my play, but it ran a little long and I didn't have any prior knowledge of the cards so players with previous plays have a distinct advantage. In some ways it feels like an optimization game in the vein of Rosenberg's games with a much different thematic feel.

RATING: 2.5
Will no longer play the game without rule tweaks due to 'broken' strategy.  Even then it is just dull.  

Everything is simply just points.  You take a loan for 10 and pay it back for 15, or it is worth -7VP at the end.  Since 3 cash is 1 point, then if you take a loan and dont pay it back, it is simply -3.7VP. If you do pay it back it is -1.7VP.

Poverty seemed interesting at first except for the fact that this has no effect on the game at all, except it gives you -VP at the end of game.  

So, when you look at buildings, some of them give a mix of cash, poverty and VP, but in the end, all of that just easily translates to points.

Some of the buildings are just clearly better than others.  Some are broken.  If you get 2xOmnibus's you will proabably win.

But it is the fact that the building boroughs and discarding cards wins every game, that everyone needs to do it, meaning that all the A cards might aswell be blank.

Very much a rushed out game, must have missed some proper playtesting and just an all round disappointment.  Probably the worst purchase I made in 2011.  Sorry Martin.

My favorite game from Martin Wallace. A card game but not a deck-building game, London is a semi-heavy strategy game that fits different elements of property-buying, card-drafting, and gathering victory points in one swift package. The game plays pretty fast with any number of players and it plays differently every time. Do I eliminate poverty or try to accumulate as much money and victory points? Or do I try a little bit from both? My only issue with this game is the quality of the currency: cheap, little tiddlywink plastic pieces of shit. Sigh. But I can't fault a game for the cheapness of its components. Or can I? Not to worry, Paulo and I just bought the Brass deluxe coins to go with London. Phew! Problem solved!

Race for the galaxy, but takes up more space, takes much much longer to play, and has targeted attacks.  Despite that, still a really good game.  Race for the galaxy is not for everyone with its extremely steep learning curve, and this is an acceptable alternative to me.  I like this game much better than seven wonders as it seems to have a good deal less luck, and player order will not be as painful.  Would like to play again soon.

You pick up cards, you build cards Uruk style (discard a colour to build a card in that colour to your tableau) and then activate all those card powers to get money, get rid of negative-VP cubes (which are acquired every time you activate your cards), earn VP's, etc. Money can buy you more cards via buying a borough on the board, and some cards have placement costs, so you spend it to make it. In short, it's a pretty standard tech buying tableau game with a number of one-use-only cards which means you re-build your tech sets, providing some intra-game variety. All good and fine ... except for the killer downtime while each player on their turn evaluates whether to pick up from the display of up to 10 cards, all with different powers, or pick up blind. Then working through their options in their hand. Which can be interesting on your turn as you evaluate and move between different combinations and strategies, but urggh when it's not your turn. After a couple of plays, the promise of interesting strategies also seems to diminish - you want to make money, convert it into VPs via cards or boroughs, get your poverty cubes down. The cards you use may differ slightly on how you do this, but their effect is the same. And the cards just keep coming each turn, and you need to play them out to keep your poverty down, so the tactical card management process offers little variety. Lastly, the game doesn't provide much thematic pull and you play in your own little world with little player interaction or tension. It's for tech card game lovers only.

I like London, it is a very sleek and clever design. I get the feeling of being forced to fallow the same pattern - Play cards, run city, buy land. Sometimes it is possible to sway from this pattern, but most of the time it is expensive or sub-optimal. The historical background of every card is nice.

Update: Played with 2 players! Wow, this game takes long even with 2 players. Hopefully we can play this faster.
It is fun to juggle between lots of cards and povertypoints. Final rating still to be decided.
Update: Have played this game with 3 and 4 people. It makes a lot of fun. Still have to figure out if the black cubes really are that big a problem.
Update: After owning this game over a year I will lower my rating because this game doesn't offer much replay value! The black cubes difficulty seems to be too easy solvable in the game. It should have been much more tight. It seems to lack a little bit on playtesting. Still a good game!

Another tough game by Martin Wallace where you try to come out as best you can. This is a card driven game, where you create and activate buildings and try to avoid getting poverty cubes which are generated by having too many cards and buildings. Definitely worth a try if you are a fan of his titles, with the one down side that there is little player interaction.

London is an engine-building card game.  Each turn, you have the choice of either playing building cards to improve your engine, or actually running the engine.  Running your engine may give you points, money, or other benefits, but it will also create "poverty" depending on the number of cards you've played and the cards you still have in hand.  Poverty is worth big negatives at the end, but only relative to player with the least.  There are lots of strategic decisions about how big you want to make your engine, and how many times you want to actually run it, while trying to manage your money too.  Over many plays, I'm starting to find that opening hand luck is very important; the player who gets the most big-money cards in their opening hand seems to have a distinct advantage in the game.

RATING: 9
Pros:
+Simple to explain for rules.
+Plays fairly quickly.
+Nice artwork on cards.

Cons:
-Can be a bit simplistic.
-Plays just ok with 2. Not bad per se, but I would rather play something else with 2.
-The black backsides to chits are annoying.
-Plastic coins are pretty meh. Would have rather had cardboard money.

Note: This game gets a 7 for 2 players and an 8 with 3 players. Have yet to play it with 4.

Edit: Bumped it up to an 8 with 2 players with the variant. Took away a lot of the free boroughs and had cards that didn't show up because of that. MUCH better with that. I'm really digging this game more and more as I play it.

Edit2: This game is fantastic. It can get a bit boring if played heavily since the game doesn't differentiate THAT much. Easily a solid 9. Really would like to play this more and find some of the subtleties.

Unique card-driven game where you can anticipate cards coming up but need to be aware that opponents can cause them to fly right out of the game.

I got to play this at my local meetup and the weight of this game is out of my comfort level. And I knew I would have gotten a headache afterwards. The game needs a few more plays to be good but for now I am docking it at a 7 simply because I haven't grown to that medium weight gamer status just yet. For now I will enjoy my lighter games. The poverty is so rampant in this game and the punishing effect of them (get 1 for each card you have in your hand) is too much for my liking.

Another solid Wallace offering. Productive turns are painful but fun, and there are always cool choices to make.  Though the cards are balanced pretty nicely, there can be the occasional lull (though I'll confess that after two plays I don't know the decks well enough to anticipate the pitfalls).  It's enjoyable, and once it gets going it's fairly quick.  It's one of those I probably won't propose to play but really enjoy it once it's begun.

London is another fine Martin Wallace game, pretty easy to learn. It's all about card/tableau management as the players build up the city of London. You don't have to have too much of a "sprawling empire" as the cost can be come high. Interesting management decisions to be found here. Not bad.

Martin Wallace did it again. This time, it is a card game - simple rules, but complex decisions and game play. Only two complaints about it (preventing me from giving out a '10'): 1 - the downtime in a 4-player game is slightly too high; 2 - one more deck (a D-Deck) would have been fine - the game is slightly too short (IMHO and after a 4-player game). 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This is an intense and very deep city builder. The way it works is, each turn you draw a card. Then you decide what you want to do on your turn. You can build a building, by paying money and placing your house on an empty spot. This draws you cards. You can play cards, but each card you play you have to discard a card of the same color to the available pool of cards that other players can grab from. Your third option is to activate the cards you played on previous turns. When you do this, you get the cool benefits of your cards, but many are one time use, and it also generates poverty cubes for you based on the number of card "stacks" you have plus cards in hand, minus number of cities built on the board. At the end of the game, being stuck with a lot of poverty cubes punishes your score significantly, so you have this fascinating tension throughout your turns while you try to balance efficiency vs safety.

RATING: 4
If you look at my profile you'll see that two of my gaming loves are card-combos and Wallace-style economic games, so combining the two sounded like a dream ticket. But the absolute killer for London is the lack of interaction. I've played three times now and felt like I barely looked up from my hand and tableau at the other players. Unlike Race and Glory to Rome, the type of action you choose doesn't really affect anyone else, and waiting for someone to run a 10-card city has the same feeling as drumming your fingers while a Village Idiot finishes their turn in Dominion.

It's also less thematically integrated than most Wallace designs, and feels like it falls into a set pattern of optimisation. Buy boroughs to fill your hand with cards, play as many cards as possible (using the display to make matching pairs), run your city while your hand is empty to make money to buy more boroughs and so on. And the board, while prettier than the usual Wallace, is almost an afterthought, which could be replaced by more cards or a list of payouts without losing much.

The poverty system is the highlight, and it does make for some interesting decisions about whether to have large and infrequent or small and frequent city runs. But the cards themselves aren't interesting enough, some are strictly better than others, it's very hard to tell who's winning or why, and it's twice as long as it needs to be, with a particularly painful endgame. Of the card combo games, it feels most like Innovation (because of the stacks, and the play/activate separation) but with less interesting cards and all the interaction taken out.

This is mostly a card game with a bit of board game added on.  The large number of different cards means that reading all the text and figuring out how to play each turn results in doubling the playing time for the first game or three.

There is also a certain luck element, but it is very enjoyable to play.  And the cards do add a lot of flavour of London over a couple of hundred years.

Feels mechanically surprisingly fresh, though I can't quite tell why. However, the game might be a bit too long for what it delivers -- if only it was squeezed into 30 minutes (which it might be with only very experienced players).

The game only works with 3-4 players; with two players it is way too easy to get huge loads of money while getting rid of poverty automatically.

Martin knocks it out of the park again!  I love learning real history while playing a game. Typically you have to play wargames to do this, but Mr. Wallace does this repeatedly in most of his games

Meh.

Not particularly strategically deep, I think.

Money cards at the start of the game are incredibly important.

I liked the forced discard mechanism, but this emphasizes the pasted-on theme. Race for the Galaxy does it so much better.

Limited replayability thanks to the lack of interesting combos and the stacked deck.

Decent, but not great (at least as a 2p game with the Ben-Luca variant). 

Tableau building game with a bit of randomness and some interesting ideas (particularly the poverty, which serves as a punishment mechanic that forces you to plan for the best moment to activate the tableau). There's not much of an engine building here, since most of the cards have a one-time effect. Still, there are many things to think about - playing each card requires discarding a card of the same color, which can be later taken by one of your opponents. It has a very nice flow and is rather enjoyable, but for me, it doesn't have any WOW! factor. Also, the ending can be a bit awkward, when noone draws the cards to finish the game, instead activating the city again and again.

Was ok while it lasted, but for us it didn't have enough staying power. After a dozen of plays it started to feel a bit samey, even with randomness of the draw.

Was tempted by this after hearing Rahdo offer such a high recommendation.

Slightly daunting when you see all the cards, but all the information is there.

Interesting infrastructure development game, in that you must be punished to grow and how you deal with that effects your ending score. Easy to understand, though there is a lot to digest on the cards and AP inevitable in the early game.

It's a good stepping stone for people who want a longer and more challenging game than Race for the Galaxy.

On the downside, there is little player interaction (except game wrecking direct attack cards) and random card draw options. While both issues can be mitigated to a degree, the direct attacks just ruin the game.

It's a fun game with a solid combination of card mechanics and short playing time for a light-medium weight game. Unfortunately it's just a little dry. There's no real desire to break it out and nothing in the game is particularly memorable afterwards, even if you enjoyed yourself.

Came back to this recently after a few years, and for me it has lost it's lustre a little. The pacing can be disjointed, and some cards definitely veer towards overpowered. Another "nearly" game from Martin Wallace, for me.

Ranked after two plays -- both two-player, using the Ben-Luca variant. My fiancee's new favorite game. Lots of interesting decisions -- feels very dynamic, although the rules are simple and there isn't too much variability --particularly among boroughs. I'm giving it an 8 for what I can best describe as subtle, elegant mechanics. The only downside has been that it drags a bit, and there isn't a whole lot of interaction. As with Innovation, I'm looking forward to this game improving with time, as we get to know the cards more.

Edit: downgrading to a 7. Game length has become a very important consideration for us as of late, and as several other reviewers have correctly pointed out, this game -- at 90+ minutes -- doesn't pack a lot of punch per minute. Even with the Ben-Luca variant (which I consider a must), the game drags far too long, and the whole boroughs game is completely boring. We ended up just quitting our last game about 2/3 of the way through.

If it were a shorter game, I would be more excited about mastering the subtleties of the card interactions, but as it stands, I'd much rather play Innovation, Seasons, Dominion, Race for the Galaxy, or even San Juan, to get my card-game fix.

RATING: 6
I like the mechanics, but I don't know that this is a game that would have a lot of replayability for me. 

Also, I think, in a card game, you need to make meaningful choices with your plays and so the Paupers don't make sense to me. There is no choice to be made with them - just that you have to find a way to get rid of them. It seems redundant with the poverty mechanic. With both the Paupers and poverty, you need to step away from generating victory points and cash to mitigate the unpleasantness. It doesn't seem like there needs to be two separate kinds of unpleasantness.

And I don't get the Underground cards. It adds extra rules to the game, but it doesn't seem to add that much depth. Admittedly, I've only played the game once, but no one even considered using those cards. They just seemed to frustrate us when we drew them.

RATING: 3
Note: Just started rating games, rating may be subject to change.

Played twice, once as a 2er and then added a 3rd player. First game was pretty interesting - a lot of cards to read, but you had to make painful decisions about which ones to keep. I was surprised at my second game how obvious the choices felt, and how few decisions I felt I was making. Some cards are obviously better than others. Hospital feels broken - combos very well with a number of cards. In terms of gameplay, it really feels optimal to first buy a district to draw cards/score points, then build your city with your new hand, then run your city to make money so you can buy another district and repeat (except at end game, when you've run out of district and want to gear up for many runs). City size seems optimal around 6 - enough that you can build with most of your hand and keep a couple good cards around between builds. Really, this game does not feel like it has legs to stand up to too many playings. I'm willing to play it at least once more to confirm this, and maybe another time to ensure there isn't much variance in strategy, because two plays isn't necessarily enough... but I think ultimately under good play the game is going to boil down to who draws better cards.

RATING: 7.75
Fun game- reminiscent of San Juan, but only barely.  London has that great thing going on where you work on your own little world, paying attention to your opponents is needed, but you can't do anything much overtly aggressive.  The game forces you to keep an eye on quite a few factors at once, and lets you pull of clever moves and feel clever for it.  Daughter approved (high praise indeed), I think this one's a keeper.

RATING: 6.99
Best Wallace game I've played? Not sure, but it certainly has a better feel. This one has a strategic element, where-as a lot of the others feel like you just need to optimise each turn individually without considering future turns and that will work just fine as a strategy.
I could have fancied some more over patterning to the cards values, and wasn't entirely convinced it needed its three deck set-up. And the text of one or two special cards is initially tricky to get your head round.
However, the game is lighter, more immersive, and seems to offer a broader range of options to the beginner.
There might be a problem in that going a little more Euro some of the flavour of what makes the other games stand out may have been lost.

I really enjoy playing this game as it fits into one of those games that is fairly simple to teach but complex to play.  Having said that, after several plays I think there may be a winning strategy to the game which would turn the game into a race.  One to keep an eye on.

Quite interesting card-based boardgame - much more to my taste than Wallace's usual dull-as-ditchwater pure economic games. (That's unfair, I know - it's certainly an exaggeration. But I have a distinct "meh" feel about most Wallace games.) London is not a game I'm in a mad rush to play again, but I've played it quite a few times and tend to enjoy it.

RATING: 7.4
:) Remarkable depth and strategic possibilities for what basically is a card game with pretty simple rules. The mechanics in this title are original (you build a city by playing cards in a number of decks (you decide how many). 'Running' your city gains points, money and different abilities, but also tends to create poverty which you need to keep under control). I love the engine building part and the flexibility the game offers me in terms of creating a small city or a big one. There is also a strong focus on hand management: most of the time you need to pay a card in order to play another and you have to figure out ways in order to dispose of certain cards which you don't want.

:) I wouldn't call the game mechanics thematically grounded ('paying' (discarding) St Pauls Cathedral in order to build Nelson's column doesn't really make any sense, does it?), but still there is thematic flavor to be found in all the different monuments and buildings found in London. You can revisit your citytrip playing London :) What's more, many cards tell their own real story in the effects they cause: you can educate initially useless paupers for a price in order so they can help you erect other buildings - or you can dispose of them in your prison, reducing poverty ([i]in that sense, I wouldn't call this game really politically correct, but hey - thematically, it makes sense[/i]).

:) Money can be really tight, creating an engine whichs generates money is all the more satisfying because of it.

:) There is quite some excitement going on as the game nears its end. It can be difficult to predict when the last rounds gets triggered, and being able to run your engine a final time often makes all the difference of the world point-wise

:soblue: The mechanics are original, rather elegant and offer flexibility to try different strategies, but they are not without flaw. There is an annoying aspect of 'luck of the draw' which plays an important role in an otherwise strategic game. Especially when the game nears its end, the game can put certain players up with an impossible hand which can leave them with a ton of penalty points without offering them any way out.

:soblue: In a pretty futile attemt to create player interaction, a few cards allow for negative player interaction (stealing some money, giving poverty to other players, etc). I feel this is uninspired, annoying and doesn't match the flow of the game

:soblue: Some downtime can occur when players start collecting many cards and need to puzzle out which cards to keep and which to discard. However, overall, downtime is limited and reasonable in London.

I like the rule how you play your cards out. You decide how many card piles you create in front of you. Every card pile is an investment: it brings you money and victory points but on the other hand costs you poverty points. It's innovative, I haven't seen this concept in any other game so far. However interaction is limited: the players mainly look at their own cards and not so much on the other players'.

Much more clear elegant system than some Wallace games. Seems it would be very easy to remember and play again after a long time of not playing, e.g. if you get a chance at a convention. But a bunch of cards with unique descriptions to keep track of, and a little bit longer than we normally prefer - in that sense, it reminded me of a somewhat quicker/lighter Le Havre. Very nice components! Played 4-player and 2-player and enjoyed it fine.

RATING: 6.5
Pros:
Delightfully themed, very engaging game. There is an ebb and flow to the game that needs to be grasped before longterm strategies reveal themselves. It's also interesting how you have to adjust your tactics to the stage of the game (beginning, middle, and end). The winner is often determined by very narrow margins, which makes for a tense gaming experience. 

Cons:
Not good with only two players. Luck of the draw plays a prominent role in determining the outcome between two equally matched players. Also, the boroughs are central to any winning strategy, so with only two players the early game is dominated by a borough arms race. However, the game presents such an interesting puzzle that, win or lose, the journey is entertaining. You have to balance your strategy and hope that the next draw will be good enough to make up for lost opportunities. I just wish the game offered more ways to mitigate luck and regain lost ground. 

- The 2nd Edition of London addresses all of the cons I've listed here. The 2nd Edition is a masterpiece.

--Nov2010-- After one play, I'm intrigued - but it's not entirely clear yet to me where the game will land in the end.  This is a pretty non-confrontational Wallace (admittedly, with occasional modest exceptions) that plays in a reasonably small amount of time.  The decisions seem significant; the play is sensible; my kids enjoyed it.  Nice family game, at very least, with the possibility of more.

The interesting thing about London is that it's map really looks like my hometown Guangzhou. I've been dreaming of re-theming this game to a Canton background.

But the Card design is very good. Martin Wallace is a genius.

I really enjoy some of Wallaces' games and I would even go as far as saying that he's portfolio of games is currently the finest available. I had high hopes for London and some of them were fulfilled. The first game left me wondering though how good is the replayability and variance in general. Also it seems that there is not much of a strategic element to it. You basically take the most out of the cards you get. The length is a plus and I will definitely try it again but overall it didn't fulfill my expectations for it.

This Wallace masterpiece doesn't need a lot of components. More or less it's a cardgame that uses a board where you can set up your boroughs. The card draft mechanism is very delightful. Tense and with the traditional Wallaceque nastiness: you WILL get problems while playing this game ... poorness, too much handcards.
Unique: at the end of our first play one player made it to have 0 VP and 0 money.

EDIT: Second play left a not so good feeling because of the multiplayer solitaire lacking of interaction. Decreased my rating from 8 to 7.5 ... although it's still a very elegant game.

Wallace does the card-laying-tableau-building thingy, and does it well. Surprisingly light, with a game length, load of vp calculating at game end, and dour art reminiscent of the old Ladybird books, that don't quite match with the lightness; so in all, a slightly odd beast. UI am guessing that at one stage before being simplified, the poverty cubes and other things actually went down on the map; the cubes and the board itself seem to be slightly out-of-place relicts of earlier incarnations. 

I think it's likely that I prefer the game that exists in a parallel universe somewhere in which the board and actual location of developments (and poverty) have greater significance - but I do find I enjoy this version all the same. 

As is typical with Mr Wallace, there are lots of very neat little ways that historical peculiarities and detail are worked into simple, abstracted mechanics. 

Enjoyed 4 player the most so far (feels very urgent) - 2 player is excellent, but poverty doesn't quite seem to work (maybe we need to use strategies that take on loads of pov early on).

RATING: 7
Fun game, although I think it could use a bit more player interaction. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very little player interaction in this game that should max out at three players due to downtime. Rules are simple, but there's a fair bit of information on the cards to read through and lots of fiddly gathering and paying of cards, cubes, money chits and VP counters. Downtime is just a huge killer here. Because you take a new card on a building turn (sometimes more with special cards), you often need time to adjust your plans while building because money can be very tight (which is a good thing).

The game will reward further play as you begin to understand how easy it is to acquire money in the early cards, but how you'll need that money by the C deck when there's a lot of victory points to be bought and very little further money coming in.

The game also plays very differently with different player numbers. Poverty points are a non issue in a two player game as both players have plentiful access to poverty point reducing cards and many burroughs on the board. With four players you really notice the fewer number of turns and how much more difficult it is to reduce your poverty. With three it's something in the middle, but you've got enough turns for some control.

I'm not a fan of the endgame. The game seems to creep to a conclusion with little tension. I'd have preferred a seeded end card to add some drama and reduce the scheming.

All in all it's an engaging and simple game for exactly three players (because two players can chat about the weather while the other is selecting cards and calculating their money), but there's not much depth to it. There's a few different strategies to try out with building stacks and whatnot, however I can't help but feel that for the same feel you'd be better off playing Innovation with double the angst and half the clutter in half the time.

On further reflection I'd sum it up as: London is a wonderful game for three or four players as long as they are experienced fast players who limit the downtime.

----------------

Two player Ben-Luca variant makes the poverty points meaningful and turns this into an enjoyable two player game. Rating bumped up a point as a result:

When I first read the rules I didn't think that I'd like the game as much as I do. This is Martin Wallace's take on development card games, like [i]Uruk[/i], with hand and resource management in order to score the most points at the end. Very thematic and engaging, it can become addictive, even when it may lack from replayability after some plays because the same cards play every game. Nevertheless, so far so good.

Picked up at the Oasis 2011 prize table. Help to rebuild London after the Great Fire of 1666. It's basically a card game with some extras. It can be a punishing game if you don't manage your poverty issues - you know, workers need a place to sleep. It's hard for the new player to know how big to make your city - I recommend 4-5 piles, but really you can make it as big as you want as long as you're managing your poverty (better than everyone else is, that is). An unusual design from Martin Wallace.

I love the thematic chrome of the game - it does a brilliant job of evoking the development of London in some very subtle ways.  And the payment by discard system is very clever, enabling there to be inferior cards which will still occasionally be useful, not to mention having to keep an eye on your opponents actions, albeit only at a general level.

I absolutely hate the economic engine part, which is just silly in places.  Whilst it is crisp and intuitive, the inherent problems of having a VP mechanism are clearly visible here (most notably the relatively painless cost of taking a loan in order to buy boroughs given that they will return the "lost" VPs by themselves.)

I find the scoring system to be just right. It rewards and penalizes in a manner consistent with the rest of the resource flow and goals throughout the game.

After two plays with two players, I find the game a little too long and a little "flat", in that it's not surprising or exciting; it works just right, but without dramatic swings in apparent victory likelihood or with cards changing the rules too much.

I'd like to try it with more players.

I finally got a chance to play this and boy, was it worth the wait.  Has some elements that are typical of Martin Wallace and I ended up loving it as much as I thought I would.  A knock against it might be that it is really just multi-player solitaire, but it is one of those few games where you watch your opponents turns very closely.  It's a great game that has some screwage player interaction, but could certainly do with a bit more - perhaps some added cards that allow you to do things to your opponents.  All-in-all it is a super game that will adequately reward Wallace fans everywhere.

After a couple plays, I'm impressed. A relatively simple rule-set with lots of emergent depth.  Turns move fast, downtime is minimal.  Possesses a nice rhythm:  build in city/draw cards, play cards, run city, repeat.  More thematic than I expected - sending Paupers to school to build a factory is awesome.  Have only played 2-player games, with the popular variant posted here on BGG (which is definitely essential, as it speeds the game up and makes poverty more of an issue). Plays in around 90 min.  I definitely need to play this with 3 or 4.  Tight.

RATING: 7
Treefrog Edition.

Tentative rating for now.

Wallace's take on a RftG & Dominion with San Juan elements. PLayers are building the city of London with their cards. Draw cards, play it, activate it for money, VP, effects. There's another sub-game where players buy boroughs on the board. This helps give cards and reduce poverty. Poverty is a negative VP element that players need to manage. It goes up when you are trying to expand your tableau of cards too quickly or with too many cards left in hand.

The thematic link to gameplay is actually VERY good. You do feel like you're laying out the city and trying to manage the elements that go into it. Building sewers helps reduce poverty for example. Clever.

But jury is still out because of several negatives:
- too much down time in a 4 player game. It's essentially multiplayer solitaire.
- possibility of a 'broken' sure-win strategy. See this thread:http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/592475/can-someone-please-counter-this-for-me

Shame as the game can be fun.

Хорошая карточная игра с полем. Не являясь любителем карточных игр, ставлю небольшой балл. Хотя особо придраться кроме, самого факта "карточности", в игре не к чему. Всё по Уоллесовски продумано, элегантно и  оформлено, пусть и не так ярко, зато в тему. Хотя коробка, как впрочем и все издания Три-фог, оставляет желать лучшего...

RATING: 6.8
Undecided what to think about it. Clearly a game where you need to know the card deck a little to plan ahead. No clear winning strategy; I've seen tiny cities do as well as big ones; I've seen strategies that run their cities every two rounds do as well as strategies that never run their cities.

Another Martin Wallace I'll probably want.

Update: watched the Essen demo -- looks good, and not that complicated either, especially for Wallace.

Update: great game, one of his best I think. It is actually not that complex but has all the Wallace touches -- very tight economy, loans, accumulation of negative points (poverty in this game, unrest in Struggle of Empires), many ways to advance your position and score. Yet, with experienced players, this approaches 75 minutes play time. Terrific!

Kicsit Szent Pétervár, kicsit 7 Wonders de azért egyedi kártyajáték a London. És a kártya szót nem véletlenül írtam az első mondatban, mert hiába a tábla tulajdonképpen a szerepét akár kártyákon is meg lehetne oldani. Az eddigi Wallace játékokhoz képest nem egy bonyolult játékról van szó. Kártyákat gyűjtünk, majd helyezünk le magunk elé, amelyek különböző módon adnak pénzt vagy győzelmi pontot, illetve szegénységet csökkentenek. Az érdekessége a játéknak ez a szegénység rész. A lapokat a lehelyezés után aktiválnunk kell, a többségük egyszer használatos, ekkor pedig a kártyák számának megfelelő szegénységpontot gyűjtünk be, amit a táblán levő kerületeink számával csökkenthetünk. A játék végén a kerületekért és a kártyákért járnak pontok, csökkentve a szegénységgel. A játék jó, nem túl hosszú, második, harmadik játékra, mire a kártyák már ismertek könnyedén játszható. Sajnos kicsit nyelvfüggő. Kiemelkedőnek nem érzem, de teljesen korrekt darab.

Played this once at BGG Con 2010 but was only mildly impressed.  The board and components are beautiful, and the idea of building your own private London from a deck of cards is a very interesting one, but there's just too much solitaire going on here for me to stay interested.

Maybe if I played it a second time I'd change my mind, but as it stands I have no intention of buying it.

Nice tight little system.  It had a CCG quality to it that was fun without all the laborious part of trying to play a CCG.  Not a whole lot of interaction other than depriving people spaces on the map and what to discard (although these things are relevant).  

Three seems to be the sweet spot for this game.  I don't have any interest in playing this with four as the map is effectively smaller, downtime is higher, and there is less control in the card draws.

A neat little game with several clever mechanics thrown together.  It's almost what I would consider a light euro once you get the flow of the game going, and I enjoyed the different paths to victory.  I've only played Wallace's Runebound, and London was a nice view on what some of his other games might be like.  While I'm not crazy about it, I'd certainly enjoy another play anytime.

RATING: 7
i don't think this is a particularly impressive design, but i have a really good time playing it.  almost completely devoid of player interaction with the sole exception of poverty.  competition for buroughs doesn't seem that big of a deal and it seems to me there is always a useful card on display to take when it's your turn, so denying your opponent a card(s) doesn't have the same effect it has in other games with a communal card supply. i remember thinking after a few plays that there weren't many hard decisions to make, and that the game kind of played itself. all that said, it's wonderful fun creating an efficient city and then watching it do it's thing.  i'm also not sure that i've really tapped all the possibilities in this one yet.

rules complexity: 4/10
strategic depth: 4/10

RATING: 9
Wallace dips his toe in the card game genre and doesn't disappoint. Like his other designs, there are some agonizing decisions to make, especially regarding debt and poverty points. But it feels remarkably fresh and new. Played in about 90 minutes for our first run through. I can only assume this will run fast on subsequent plays. Fantastic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
I love playing London! But... There is a part of this game that bugs me a bit. Really, I love almost every thing about it: the card play, the awesome card stack mechanic, the poverty, the Wallace loan system, etc. 

But the map just really does not integrate that well with the game. Purchasing the buildings works as a mechanic, but it just doesn't seem to fit. In our games, everyone generally buys up all the buildings (regions on the map) in the beginning, because - well, you have to. If you let the other players get them, you'll be screwed big time. 

Having said that, I always want to play this and the issue mentioned just fades away into the background shortly after I start playing. 

As for the two player - that took some work, but after eliminating some cards and tweaking a rule, it's now quite good. I have even devised a two player version where I don't even use the map at all - the Burroughs are listed on a piece of paper with all their characteristics, bonuses and restrictions, and thats really all you need. In the end - a solid 8.5 in my book. 

Love the art style too -

London is the tableau building card game I was looking for. I had tried both San Juan and Race for the Galaxy before, but neither really clicked with me. London focuses more on hand management than card combinations, which impacts the luck-of-the-draw factor a lot. Also, the card deck is more or less structured so there is a sense of development and it offers some strategic play as well. Both the variable poverty scoring and the card tableau are great indirect forms of player interaction.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
The board really doesn't have that much impact on gameplay, the cards are a little plain, but the actual mechanics blend so beautifully well to create a captivating game. I think I enjoy its simplicity and that the general flow of the game is so wonderfully rhythmic; build up your hand, play it, run your city, repeat. Oddly enough, I consider it one of Wallace's best titles, but maybe that's because I'm not the biggest Wallace fan.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game is a bit lacking in player interaction, especially for a Martin Wallace game. That being said, I quite enjoyed my first play of London. It was a challenge to build and run my city while also keeping poverty in check. I liked the mechanic that makes players discard cards to the board, cards which then become available for other players to draw.

Unlike any other Wallace game. This is a card game that feels a little like Innovation (you are playing cards (paying with other cards), then using those cards to generate points and/or money) and Dominion (don't discard every turn, but you only use most cards once -- your card display turns over sort of like Dominion hands do, but in slow motion over several turns). Also like Race for the Galaxy: you can keep your head down and do your own thing, but you'll likely do better if you pay attention to what others are doing, and try to counter them. Despite all the differences, you still have a few Wallace standards: loans, which you cannot pay off till the game ends, and poverty penalty points, which cost you VP. 

Looking forward to playing this more! I could see my rating of this go up, especially if it becomes a system -- with expansion maps and rules -- rather than just a game.


--- Ben-Zen-Luca 2-Player Variant ---
1) No face up duplicate buildings allowed in a single player's city display. Building something, flipping it, then building the same card again later is allowed.

2) When a player expends a card forcing a clearing of a row in the card display, that player places a neutral marker of a third colour in a city borough of their choice. The appropriate number of cards based on that borough are drawn from the deck and immediately discarded.

--- Larry Levy Solo Variant ---
1. You take your turn
2. Discard the top 3 cards from the deck
3. Add the next 3 cards to the display
4. Take your next turn and repeat
5. You're limited to buying only 5 boroughs. You can buy whichever ones you wish. Don't bother placing opposing markers, just limit yourself to 5 borough purchases.
6. Use the full 10 card display

A card game about one of the most interesting cities of the world but with no relevant theme element IMO. The set is in London but it could easily be in any other city of the world.
It has some nice mechanics such as the way players run their city or deal with the poverty points but the real decisions tend to be too much obvious for my tastes. 
As a disclamer I should say that I don't like card games in particular. That said, London has the ability to make players play cards as a single important decision to take during the game: which cards should I pick up and discard and which should I play in my city. The rest of the game actions, the real actions their selves are too much obvious: Players build boroughs to get cards, play cards and run city. Get cards, play cards and run city. There's no point in taking a different than obvious decision because it's too much obvious not to take it, sort of speaking.

I like games that have important decisions to take and not obvious channels to follow. London seems too much like an obvious path in which players with the most experience/patience seem to do better most of the time. I prefer a game that explores some risk and decision making towards the flow of the game itself and towards the final analysis rather than a previous conceived decision taking (dull) game.

I don't know why I can feel disappointed and at the same time rate this game an 6 - its not a bad game. 

2nd play - the lack if interaction has a greater weighting than the interesting mechanics and theme. I enjoy playing the game and its quick but its Wallace's weakest game for some time.

3rd play to with borough variant and  more enjoyable than my 3 player games as there was more interaction

4 -6 not an unpleasant experience, but vaguely pointless solitaire exercise, mitigated by the theme being my home town

London, Wallace's 'card game', or so I was lead to believe.  Sure the cards are important and the board a little less so, but this is almost as much a card game as Brass.  ...And this is no Brass.  Take that as a slight, but let's be honest, Not much compares favorably to Brass, so let us not bury London yet. 

It is a solid design and gets to the meat quickly.  You can pound out a game of this in 45 minutes and it ends up being a satisfying if not memorably experience.  I always enjoy how Wallace finds a way to add some sort of action efficiency in his designs.  In London, you have to balance money and poverty with victory points; but it is not the best balance that wins, it's who accomplishes these things in a more efficient manner.

This a very good game.  It seemed, for some reason I'm not clear on after just one play, a little dry, but the mechanics and play were definitely solid.  I think the history tie-in, in typical Wallace fashion, is great and interesting, and does not seem pasted-on, but integral to the design.  

The rating could easily go up, but I doubt it would go down.  The main thing I could see which *might* prevent it from being an oft-played favorite is that it is nominally similar to Glory to Rome, but GtR plays quicker, and has an outrageously fun power-curve which puts it a couple interest-steps above "building while trying to get rid of poverty."
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Complex and finely designed challenge involving getting cards into play-ready position and then activating them.  Poverty points for surplus cards in hand when you decide to activate ("run your city"), and there's a hand limit to boot, so you can't just stockpile; you need to take advantage of what's in front of you in the most sensible possible way.

There are some things in this game that I like, and some that I hate.

I don't like: complicated poverty system and penalizing effects of it; some cards which once obtained by one player give him ultimate advantage over others (thus, randomization in this game sucks, very powerful cards are scarce and while these may not be a key to the victory, without them you may be in troubles); loans, which are another tool of punishment; downtimes; finally, turns and actions, which can be take in any order, usually work in one rhythm only.

I like the fact that the game forces me to find new strategies every time I play, to find some way to balance poverty, number of cards and building strategy.

In sum, there are some things that are raising my ranking for this game, but in overall it is not worthy enough.

First Martin Wallace game I have played. Pretty intuitive. I liked this very much. Reminded me a bit of Notre Dame. I got decimated due to going for money rather than staving off poverty cubes. Lots of agonizing decisions. Could have been improved with a three elements: more interaction between players (other than a few special cards, we are all pretty much playing solitaire), more use of the board, and elimination of the game ender being the end of the deck which could really draw out the game.

This one reminds me of Race for the Galaxy, but with more stuff built in and less variety.  You're basically trying to create an engine with cards while fighting off a very interesting poverty mechanism.  There's a nice balancing act going on and it seems like there are lots of ways to play well.

Jogo Medio de Wallace, em que tentamos comprar bairros em Londres para termos o maximo de pontos de vitoria possivel, mas por outro lado tentamos fugir á pobreza. Tipo de accões limitado e simples, com a particularidade de para se activar cartas que temos á nossa frente , temos a seguir que somar o numero delas ao numero que temos na mão e subtrair aos bairros que temos para obter a  pontos de pobreza! Pontos esse que são deduzidos no final do jogo aos pontos de vitoria que então ganhamos. Excelente jogo , muito estrategico.

Another card game, but not a standard one. You can build as many stacks with your cards as you want, but the more stacks, the more poverty. You don`t want poverty - minus points at the end of the game (just like in 20th Century).

You can use the most cards only once, so you can`t play a one combo the whole game. You need some luck, to draw the cards that you need. 

The interaction is on a very low level (discarding cards, that other players can take, and a few "bad cards"). 

London is different than other card games, but after one game i don`t see many ways. I think like in 20th century, you need to "recycle" the poverty, but to do that, you need the right cards. You must build houses in London (points and many new cards), to build you need money. To have money, you must activate cards, that brings money (luck to draw this cards when you need them).

Maybe another games will show more strategies, than it will be more interesting, not so luck dependend and will have replaybility.

Love this one! It's essentially a card game, but it is much more than that. First class card art, elegant game design, and a manageable Martin Wallace game to learn if you are new to his games.

RATING: 5
Not a good first experience: One player happened to get a set of cards that allowed him to generate VPs, money, and negative poverty--all persistent cards. Needless to say, he was unstoppable. Probably this was a fluke, but still....

The limited edition is quite nice.

This lighter Wallace outing is a winner, equally so with two players or four.  If you are an anglophile like me, you will find the London's theme as historically evocative as its mechanics are innovative.  Lots of priorities and plans to be kept in the air...  and lots of opportunity to wreck your opponents' little juggling act, too.  (Currently by favorite 2-player with my wife.)

RATING: 4
Enjoyable enough, but not really my style. It's a game that would benefit from multiple plays I'm sure. However, it is also one of those boardgames that feels like a card game in play. The interaction isn't much. You either get into the planning and combinations that you are building, or you don't. I didn't, not really.

RATING: 7
London is a unique (mostly) card game in which the players are setting up their cities and then running them.  There are a lot of interesting decisions to be made as to the size of the cities and how often to run them.  The ever present poverty must be controlled, but only to the degree that other players are controlling it.  And being a Wallace game, there is the decision as to when to take out loans.  Overall, a good game that moves along at a good pace.

5/14/11: I like making card combinations, and that's what this is all about so I've enjoyed my plays so far. That being said, the player interaction is practically non-existent so be warned.

12/4/12: I'm actually not too sure about this game. I've downgraded my rating from 7 to 6 after a couple more plays. It feels a little long for what it is and isn't very dramatic. Running your city can take a long time, creating excessive downtime with more than 2 players.

A good game, but I can't help thinking it isn't quite deep enough for the playtime - though once again, this is down to our group taking so damn long to play games like this. The poverty cube mechanic adds a nice element to the game, and reminds me somewhat of the rats in Notre Dame.

Very clever game mechanics, have to balance many aspects to get a good score. Not that much player interaction, but the game discard area serves as a bit of interaction as some other players could pick up a discarded card that you have been eyeing. Its only weakness is probably lack of interaction, which many people may actually enjoy.

This game has a board and pieces you place on the board, but in reality it's just a card game; the board play is a very minor part of the proceedings. Not that that's a bad thing ... in fact, though I still have many new titles to play, I think it's likely this will emerge as my favorite game from the Essen 2010 crop. Players have an amazingly diverse number of options in regards to how they choose to play (conservative, with few cards stacks and generating few poverty points; sprawling, with a productive engine but lots of poverty; spendthrift, taking lots of loans and banking lots of points during the game but paying for it later; thrifty, with things slower to develop but no loans to repay), but any of these stragegies can bring victory. London is fairly simple and easy to teach but has some real depth. Martin Wallace continues to impress ...

Has the same sterile, clipart style as most other Treefrog games, which is very unappealing. The gameplay itself is not much better. It's basically a card game where you spend cards to play cards but other games have done this much better (Race for the Galaxy, etc). We also encountered some balance problems in our very first play of the game. One player got both Omnibus cards and just easily won the game with no competition. Given the history of Martin Wallace balance problems, this makes me think his games aren't very well playtested.

one play down.  The mechanics work well enough, but they seem dated because of the lack of interaction and the length of turns.  It's odd too because some turns take 5 minutes, whereas the next turn may take 2 seconds.  The "one shot" cards shouldn't be in the game (confusing).  

I liked it, but it's difficult to understand the card interactions on the 1st play-through, and I don't think I enjoyed it enough to play enough times to truly understand it.

London is one of the first ever games I played with a public gaming group (Inner West Gamers, Sydney). I was completely enamoured with this game, and by association the group, and both are now permanent parts of my life.

A beautifully intricate game, with many moving parts that work oh so well together, and a negative currency of poverty that is unlike anything else I've played. Quite simply, I love it.

Still haven't tried the new version, hope to soon!

RATING: 6
Falling a bit in my estimation after half a dozen plays.  This is a card game along the lines of San Juan/Race for the Galaxy/Glory to Rome with some typical Wallace twists are thrown into this mix:  loans of course, but also the poverty points that are continually dogging you (reminiscent of loss cubes in Automobile or water in Tinners' Trail).  I like the aforementioned games and much of Wallace's offereings, so I was very enthusiastic about this at first.
My concern now is that there isn't really room to pursue very differentiated strategies:  no player will want to fall behind on boroughs, so all should end with about the same number.  Because everyone is doing roughy the same thing, the cards tend to just be plain more or less powerful as opposed to being more or less useful depending on your strategy.  So the outcome becomes a question of who gets the greatest number of the really good cards (Hospital, Omnibus, Underground, Whitehall and maybe a few others) rather than who adapts a strategy to his cards the best.
The two player game seems both pointless (because there is no real pressure around poverty) and borderline broken (because the power of the Omnibus is magnified with only 2 players).  I'm willing to give it a few more shots with 4 to see if there is enough room for differentiation there.  But my fear is that this ends up as an interesting and well themed game that is cool for a few plays but ultimately lacks staying power.

A really solid tableau builder that draws inspiration from San Juan etc. but with classic Wallace twists. Purchasing burroughs is essential. build big and run a big city less often. Get the timing wrong and you'll be out of the game quickly.

This is one of the simpler Martin Wallace games with respect to rules, but results in a very interesting and engaging game.

[u]Required variant:[/u] must be played disallowing 2 active Omnibuses in the same tableau. 

[u]Poverty in 2-player:[/u] to address the loss of poverty relevence in 2 player, each starts with 20 poverty (actually, next time I'll go to 25). Thanks to Bryan {Mr_Nuts] for the idea & reporting this successful variant.

I think with an experienced 3-player table, the poverty should also be increased to at least 10 as the starting set-up. It keeps poverty strategically meaningful. I do think inexperienced players needn't modify the starting poverty as tempo mistakes can really punish.

*

Getting good involves receptivity rather than forcing a path. The money & tempo management are clear & aren't overpowered, small gains that build in brief interludes that flip over & out of the game in an interesting core 'run city' mechanic. Leveraging the seemingly tiny differences in these cards & cashflow, and recognizing the situation that calls for one above the other, brings a heightened alertness & sustains replay. In 11 games I have started each with a different premise & direction, more an inquiry that bends & jukes through the game, and the different valuations of these same cards through the deck has surprised me. As well as the opportunities for denial, or upseting tempo - when they come. All of this makes for very many decisions in the game along with sustaining flow. 

[u]First plays:[/u] The dynamic between game elements is balanced, elastic, and variable. There is card management, money, raw VP’s, poverty reduction & attack, loans, borough placement on the map, an underground, a common pool used as resources and an alternate draw deck, and deck and endgame manipulation. The game does not reward any singular strategy over another; the elasticity will snap you back. With every powerful play, there is a cost, be it in one of the other variables or in tempo. Big money, for example, does not a win make.

"London lies devastated after the Great Fire of 1666. This is your opportunity to build a new city on the ashes of the old. It is up to you how you employ the talents of the people of London to this end. Will you favour the business classes, who will earn you money? Or would you prefer to spend more money than you can rightly afford on grand monuments and sumptuous palaces? You must also deal with the problem of rising poverty and how to employ the many paupers of the city. Throughout the game you will be forced to make tough decisions. To achieve one aim you must sacrifice another, which may open an opportunity for a competitor."

Nearly 250 years of progress is glimpsed in this game. Famous buildings and monuments of the era as well as engineering developments such as streetlights are illustrated on the cards.

RATING: 9
A wonderful recreation of an historical period where players compete by creating card tableaus that fuel the building of boroughs.  

London and Ankh Morpork are sister cities so the two boards have a similar artistic design.  The short turn around "deck building" aspect provides a feeling of completing projects and moving on to build again.

Best with 3-4 players.

I am usually mildly enthusiastic about Wallace's designs. I think I have played many of his games from Age of Steam to La Strada. Liberte remains one of my favorite game from his collection and London fails to wrest the crown from Liberte. I have only played London once two player and while I do find it intriguing, I am a little bit suspicious about the replayability. First, it is true that player interaction is low. Each player has their own sandbox tableau to build, but the sandbox is quite large. You can have a variety of cards and strategies, but you don't really have to lift your head up to look at others to build your tableau other than when you buy land or properties from the main board. This is not a bad thing for gamers who like low confrontation/interaction sort of games. There is enough variation there to sustain several plays. 
     What I worry most from first blush is the cadence and rhythm of the game that feels samey from round to round. It is immediately clear that buying properties on the board is crucial to get several types of benefit: 1)reduce poverty points each time your run a city; 2) Score victory points; 3) Greatly increase hand size; 4) Earn income through card play. These positives make landgrabbing a common feature of the game. In a 2 player game, it felt that we were always going through the same cycles: 1)run city earn income; 2) Buy properties, draw cards; 3) play cards and the cycle repeats itself until end game. There was very little variation in that rhythm except that sometimes, two consecutive rounds maybe spent on buying properties or playing cards. After a while, it felt that my opponent and I were just going through the same cadence during each turn and it felt a little odd. Perhaps there is more variety and strategy than that, but I just don't think I see it that much. The next time I play the game, I will be tempted to go through the same exact cycle just because buying London properties seem to be such a huge part of the game.

After 3 plays, the 1st-time fun is gone. The game is bad because (atm) there is [b]one[/b] winning strategy/way; either you go along (and then the game becomes: "he wins the one who first gets the 'good' cards"), or you lose. Clearly the broken loan-buyland-drawcards (aka drafting) combo was not (thoroughly) playtested, and (up to now) there is no official word about this.. Shame for a game that could be much better, shame about the designer.. Bottom line: Don't believe the hype!

After first play:

I think what I love most about this game is the theme, having visited London a few years ago and gaining an appreciation for the heritage and history of the city.

I love the balance between caring for the poor, yet conducting businesses that will prosper. One cannot focus so much on poverty, or he will have not the money to afford what is necessary to bring London back to its glory. But one cannot focus solely on glory, or the poverty will become too overwhelming.

Looking forward to the next few plays to get to know the game a bit better.

I was beginning to despair for the "discard cards to pay for other cards" mechanic.  I'd played the heavy-hitters in that genre: [gameid=8217], [gameid=28143], and [gameid=19857].  All had fallen flat for me.  But Martin Wallace has come through here, as he has created a game that is much more intriguing.  The simple addition of A, B, and C decks, and a shared tableau to which you discard your cards means that the game has much more staying power, a greater ability to plan beyond hoping to draw the right cards, and a synchronicity with the rest of the table that makes things very interesting.  Sure, the map is mostly extraneous, but it's a nice touch.  Short games don't get much better at blending theme and mechanics than this one.

RATING: 8
A card game from M.Wallace, probably lighter than most of its previous productions.
I have much doubt on the game with 2 players (poverty should not be an issue here). I also think the game drags a little with 4p. But it's a great 3 players game ! Innovative mechanics, not too much rules, some risk taking, some decisions. All in all a good game, that needs to be played fast, due to the low-level of player interactions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Draw cards, place them in your area, flip them over once you've taken the benefit, as most cards can only ever be used once. Cards in hand and the number of piles you have in your area give poverty, costing you points. That's the majority of the game right there. The board is a place to store the discarded cards, as you can draw from there rather than the deck. Also, you can purchase areas of the city, this gives you points, cards, and reduces your poverty. Didn't blow me away as much as I had thought it might. It was good, and I enjoyed it a lot, but it ran a bit long. Hard to judge perhaps because you don't know the cards at the beginning, so it was hard to tell which card to build vs what to discard, etc.

For 2 player games, I invented the [thread=621605]Ben-Luca 2 player variant[/thread], which has received lots of positive feedback from those who have tried it.

One of Mr Wallace's newer offerings: a well designed, great while easy to play card drafting game. Building a ravaged London up after the great fire you buy areas of the town, build a portfolio of building cards in front of you, the run your portfolio for benefits from the cards, ie cash. There are multiple routes to victory so rather than being solitaire you have to pay attention to what everyone else is doing so you can react. Highly recommended

Not Martin's best game. Played with two with the Ben-Luca variant. Without it, the game can become interminable if you cycle through the cards in the display instead of rapidly drawing new ones. The end condition is 'deck emptied'.

It's also multi-player solitaire par excellence. The districts and display don't provide sufficient meaningful interaction - it's not usually worth blocking. And the 'running your city' aspect can take a long time to process, increasing downtime. I was genuinely searching on the internet for house rules during our two-player game while my husband was taking his turn.

We subsequently did a first play of Goa (published early 2000s) and this really really showed up how mediocre London is. There isn't really any contest in terms of paths to victory, player interaction, and so on. Who says game design has improved over the last decade...

RATING: 8
One of the best Martin Wallace games. Tableau building with restrictions, card management, and a city board. 

Pretty good at 2 with the 2 player variant but you don't see roughly 30-35% of the cards. With 3 or 4 players you see all of the cards. Sweet spot for this game is probably 3, though I haven't tried it at 4 yet.

I've heard some comparisons between this game and Race for the Galaxy, and while I sort of get it (spending cards to play cards into a tableau that give you special abilities), I really don't see it at all.  The tension of the game is different, thanks to the way that the different actions benefit you, and trying to balance the money, the VPs, the buildings, and your poverty points is a much, much different experience than Race will ever give you.  It's certainly more accessible than other Wallace games, but that doesn't necessarily mean that it's any easier to play.

My first impression is that the game might devolve into a tactical game, which isn't a bad thing, but it's different than what I expected.  Additionally, because players can play as many cards as they want for one action, and then activate buildings in any order they wish for another, the min-maxing effect of the game leads to some AP-ness, and more down time than I would have expected for the game.  I think that 4 players is probably above my own threshold, but 2 players might not give the game enough variety.  Either way, I look forward to playing again.

Another solid Martin Wallace offering which (as always) integrates very well theme and gameplay. You have to manage poverty, money (taking loans as necessary) and building your city (card display).

London is a Race for the Galaxy style tableau building  game, so it will definitely appeal to card gamers more than Wallace's usual fan base. I'm not sure what kind of legs it is going to have, because the card effects are pretty simple and player interaction is minimal. As an example of innovative abstraction though, the game is an absolute work of art. Managing poverty levels is easier said than done and players spend most of the game feeling completely cash strapped. If you're not, then more than likely all of that "profitability" will lead to eventual crushing poverty in the late game. Maybe he should have named this game, "Reaganomics".

A very solid game. Pretty easy rules but not that easy to win. Only minor set back is the fact that the card 'omnibus' is overpowering the outcome in a 2-player game. So we adjusted the rules a bit.

Quite different than other MW games and now my favorite MW game.  It's a solid hand management game played out with board elements.  The progress of the cards fits the theme of rebuilding London through the centuries following the great fire.  The mechanics are well thought out and seamless.  The choices are tough on you.  Timing on when to run the city, how big to build it, how many burroughs to invest in, and which cards to use are a nice challenge.

It's a very interesting economic game by Martin Wallace... or at least half of it.  

The povety mechanics and the tableau-building system work great, you have to carefully balance your development throughout the game. The only problem is that everything that happens on the map is rather dull - once all the boroughs are in place you can't really change or build anything there (apart from the underground, which is basically +2 VPs really). Also, you can really abuse the "poverty discount" strategy when buying a lot of boroughs early on in the game. I wish the spatial aspect was given more attention from the designer as it significantly  lowers the overall rating of an otherwise very good, clever card game (throw away the map and it's an instant 8/10).

/update (September 24, 2017): Great news, Martin Wallace learnt his lesson and got rid of the whole board in the second edition of the game. THAT's the game I want to try out now! I hope I'll be able to play it one day.

This is the point that I realized that I wasn't a huge fan of Martin Wallace games. 

Economic games where you have to dig out of a hole aren't my thing.

Neither are games that "go live" with some number of bugs or lax playtesting. See also A Few Acres of Snow. I guess I'm not a huge fan of the designer anyway and adding potential for unbalance within the game to those in the know doesn't help much. 

At least I got decent trade for it.

Playing this again reminded me of how great a game it is: tough decision between what cards to play and which to discard, and the fun of creating an efficient (or sprawling) tableau as you rebuild London from the ruins of the Great Fire.  Typical Wallace punishment for inefficiency, and wonderfully thematic cards.

The chance to play a game about a city I grew up sold me on London. The buildings, people, boroughs are all here, and the mechanics seem pretty straight forward. Suspect YMMV depending on whether you are playing "the Wren card" or playing "Sir Christopher Wren". First game I've felt inclined to sleeve the cards (Mayday Premium Euro Card Sleeves a perfect fit but slippery).

As influential Londoners we are trying to rebuild the city after the great fire in 1666. Color themed cards are drawn to flesh out your part of the city as stacks. To build a card you pay a card of its same color into a shared discard pool.  The size of your city increases your poverty level.  Investment in the surrounding boroughs offsets your poverty.  To run the city you activate the cards in your stacks.  Smooth, intuitive card game with some area control and economic sim. Fun balancing act.

Een spel dat je genadeloos afstraft als je een paar foutjes maakt.

Spelers bouwen de stad Londen weer op na de verwoestende brand van 1666. Hierbij moeten ze echter wel uitkijken dat de heropbouw niet te snel gaat en daardoor erg veel verpaupering veroorzaakt.

Een kaartgedreven spel met slechts erg weinig interactie. Daarentegen biedt het wel veel uitdaging, want om dit spel goed te spelen heb je absoluut een paar spelletjes onder de riem nodig.

This is my least favorite Martin Wallace game by a good stretch.  Mr. Wallace has his ups and downs, like other designers, but this one drops to the bottom of the barrel for me.

While building and running a city is an imaginative framework, London ends up being a pointless contribution to the Race from the Galaxy school of game design, in which players build their solitary, completely noninteractive tableau of cards and then squeeze money and victory points out of them.

What makes London significantly worse than those games (which I already dislike) is the following:

Players spend a lot of time (I mean, a LOT of time) staring into space waiting for their turn.

Through no effort of their own, players can randomly luck into cards (Huguenots, Jewish Immigrants) that bestow double-draw benefits.  There are also Pauper cards whose only purpose is to clog up players' hands with dead draws; these cards are, of course, also drawn at random.

Some cards are strictly worse than other cards, the only difference being that some cards are available for drafting later in the game due to the A/B/C deck structure.

In my first/last game of London, I found myself frequently hoping that the previous player would discard a certain color card so that I could play its color-mate sitting in my hand.  (Or, failing that, I was stuck hoping that I would draw the color myself.) The game's partial reliance on a hope-based strategy is unacceptable, and is certainly a hallmark of an underdeveloped game.

The board is barely necessary, as its only purpose is to keep track of action/VP areas purchased.  The game could be revised to eliminate the board entirely, which if nothing else would drive down the purchase price to a reasonable level.

The game is fatally flawed, in that the endgame trigger (when the last card is drawn) can incapacitate players who need to play their last few cards and run their cities/tableaus one final time to be competitive.  

In conclusion:

You should test the waters of this Thames disaster so that you don't inadvertently jump into the mouth of a river shark.  I value my lower extremities, and you should too.

Very neat card management game. You are rebuilding London by playing cards in front of you. You then "run" your city and take advantage of the bonuses on the cards. The number of cards you have in play plus in your hand equals the number of poverty (negative points) you pick up. It is a balancing act between positive points, money and poverty. It works very well.

Another decent game from Martin Wallace. It plays pretty quickly once you get the hang of things; short turns interspersed with some interesting decisions over when to run your city. I love the thematic integration, particularly how one good way of getting rid of the useless Pauper cards is to educate them with a School card. I have some reservations about the first part of the game being more or less scripted - some of that could have been absorbed into setup.

Painful. You're either dead broke or swimming in poverty. I really like the mechanics in this game: flipping cards to avoid broken, repetitive combos; the borough system granting VPs and cards while decreasing poverty; the poverty cube formula. Everything comes together great to create a well-oiled economic tableau driven card game. Fairly heavy for what is basically a card game.

That said, it is completely necessary to use the 2-player Ben-Luca variant. Works extremely well. The one problem I have in 2-player is that poverty can totally ruin you in scoring since you're only competing against one person. So really you need to prioritize being equal to or better than your opponent in poverty or you're pretty much cooked.

Martin Wallace's lightest game is too light for my tastes; my players will still AP on it. It is a multiplayer solitaire and features the least amount of player interaction in all Wallace's designs.

Sadly, I've come to the conclusion that this game is broken after running through multiple solo plays (playing 2-4 hands by myself) using the "take loans to buy boroughs and cycle the deck" strategy.  I've tried various different approaches to counter the strategy, but it seems dominant and the only effective counter is to "do it too."  Then the game devolves into who can build the best hand of cards before being forced to actually build and run a city.  Too bad, because initially I had this rated quite highly and enjoyed it a good deal.  Now, it's going to sit on the shelf gathering dust.

Some people on here have worked up variants to try to eliminate this problem according to the forums.

This is not a bad game but I expect more for a Martin Wallace game. I also firmly believe this game was done with the board for a money grab - this is clearly a card game and its price should be 20-30 bucks not 70 - and that knock it's rating by a point

Delicioso juego con un impagable aire a Mary Poppins. Construye Londres a partir de sus cenizas: colegios, cafés, puertos , universidades, el parlamento, el Palacio de Buckingham, el alumbrado, etc... Todas las cartas bellamente ilustradas.

Los jugadores compran barrios que les otorgan más cartas y puntos de victoria. Su mecánica llana, limpia y muy dinámica que te hace preguntarte porqué el autor no goza ya de tener una calle con su nombre. Para mi grupo inagotable y divertido, y a dos soberbio. Un tesoro que no deja de ver mesa.

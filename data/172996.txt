GAME: The King Is Dead
RANK: 1161
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It's a game of nuanced opportunism and utilizing minimal effects at the appropriate time (since you only get 8 actions a game). Sort of a delicate cardboard judo at 2p, and at 4p, it becomes much more defensive and trying to subtly communicate a strategy to your teammate through the limited actions. Second, it can be a very tense game, and oddly enough, Twilight Struggle is the only other game that I get that sort of level of tension out of. I think both games share a "you can only accomplish so much" sort of drive to them so make hay while the sun shines. One thing that does stand out, is that the game shines most when there is a real threat to one of the three factions not taking power in a region; if the Saxons (or the Mordred group) look like they might take over, it starts to really drive other player's decisions and allow you to position other players to use their actions in a sub optimal way. Recommend you play the first couple games without the Mordred variant, but after that, it adds a nice spice (seems to help power the crown and 2 movement cards in particular as scoring order becomes more important). After 12 or so games with various player counts, a really strong 7.

What it needs is a really solid player aid on the victory conditions. I keep meaning to make one...

edit: almost 20 games in, still a 7. Fires Wallace's Liberte for me (accomplishes a very similar goal with less overhead in about 1/4th the time). Still enjoy it across all player counts, but the Mordreds are virtually required at 2p anymore (and recommended in general).

edit2: Grows to an 8 with people who really know what they are doing. I think my current rating is mildly aspirational, but the games I get to play with the folks who get really jazzed about this game are so fantastic. Best at 3p with that group. The 4p experienced games are different (neither better or worse) and a nice change of pace. The Mordred variant is mandatory IMHO. Still needs a solid player aid on the victory conditions.

edit3: Still think the Mordred variant is an overall positive. One thing that I've found it does is there is a natural question of commitment to a strategy (think "when do I pick a God" in The Great Zimbabwe) and the sooner you commit to a strategy, the more opponents can foil you, so you wait till the end to actually say "ok, I'm going to make the Saxon's invade vs a control victory." The Mordred short circuits or muddies that commitment question. Now you can resolve zones that might mean you don't have the time to advance your stock for Control over the entire 8 rounds because the Mordred condition is triggered. Now, when you have to commit to a strategy is determined by when the Mordred regions are scored, so watching a Saxon invasion or a Mordred control victory are possible on region 5 which is a much earlier time point and triggers a flurry of activity in a somewhat suboptimal way (assuming the game will go a full 8 rounds). An oddity is all.

It is a very clever area control game and plays best with three players where each player fights to gain majority of different factions (similar to Dogs of War). It combines cards, area control, and set collection in a very simple but deep way.

1st play: Very short area control game that was hard to pin down.  Only 8 actions over the course of the game and there was a lot of potential for ties.  Making yourself stronger in a specific color makes the color weaker on the board, so it's a delicate balancing act to pick which colors are going to be strongest and making sure you have the majority in it.  It feels a bit chaotic because your actual moves are limited and there may be an issue with just playing all your cards in the final turn.

2nd play: I played this time trying the "go last" strategy and it won.  I don't like that this is a viable path to victory, to win by avoiding the thing that is fun.  I didn't feel like there were a ton of choices and they all felt similar.

This game first came to me because the guys playing it wanted to try a three player game so they asked me to join. One of them told me "girls don't usually like this game" and thanked me for being adventurous enough to try it anyway, he said this expecting me to not like it and to certainly lose, but something clicked in my head and I totally got the game, enjoyed it, and ended up winning (I took them by surprise). I really love this game and I'll take anybody on :)

Games should reward players for accomplishing interesting goals. Games should never penalize players for doing something fun. Playing cards is fun. Changing the board is fun. By never drawing new cards, and never being able to pick up discarded cards, players are punished in later rounds if they exhausted their cards earlier. To engage in the game is to limit your experience with the game. 

On a positive, the game is so short you may not mind.

Anything that can be explained quick, play quick with depth is always off to a good start and there is a fair amount of fun in the box too.  Only played 2/ 3 player and not with the expansion/variant included so much more to explore.  Can be very thinky if you wish it or you can just relax and enjoy the chaos.  Plenty of theme if you go looking for it although at its most thinky some of the theme dissipates away.  Mechanics all work very well.

Very impressed by this short game. You get 8 actions. 8. No more than that and yet this game satisfies. It forces you to make every action count (or not count, which is an important aspect too!)

Played this twice in a row, with the second game hard fought for, now that we had a taste for how to manipulate things to our favour. Came down to the tie breaker!

RATING: 7.5
I love this game just for the fact that it's easy to teach but offers 30 minutes of solid strategic gameplay. It's also unique by being an area control game but no one is controlling just one faction. I don't normally like area control games that much but this one does it well because it's almost secondary to the excellent card gameplay. Having just 8 actions but being able to carry out any number of those actions during any turn really opens up the possible strategic pathways. This game is almost in the filler territory  because of it's relatively short game length and light rules but is much deeper than the typical filler.

Area control combined with stock management. You win when you have invested the most in one of the three factions that controls the most areas. Eight rounds, eight areas to be resolved, eight action cards to play, eight times the chance to invest in a faction.

This is a very tight game. There's a constant balancing act going on. You try to gain and maintain initiative, but when a player is not paying attention enough, it's possible he or she acts as a kingmaker. With three players the suspense works best.

Since the number of cubes (faction armies) on the board are pretty limited, the chance of on area resolving in a tie is common. It's even an alternative ending condition; When four areas end up in a tie, the game ends. When that happens not the faction with the most control tokens is evaluated, but he number of sets you have that's made up out of each faction (each set of red, yellow and blue).

Yes, it's a dry game. But it's short and feels like a light multiplayer version of checkers. Clean and simple rules and it acts perfectly as a filler when you've got some brain energy left.

RATING: 5.5
I wanted to love what I saw as an "el grande light" style of game and while the main mechanisms of choosing where to pull cubes from the board is super intriguing, the rest of the gameplay choices dont matter as much. With only 8 cards it feels like your waiting for everyone else to overplay so that you can swoop in and win, but then everyone plays that way, so nothing happens for most of the game. Worst of all, the end game comes down to a stalemate and like a third tiebreaker way too often. Maybe it's just for more thinky gamers than me. I still liked it, but traded it away.

A game of incredibly tight margins. Timing, precision and awareness are critical. Does that sound compelling to you? It's because this is the best pure area control game next to El Grande. El Grande is still the game to beat at 4 to 5 players. For less? The King is Dead is King.

A very over-looked cube pusher/manipulator. For a game that only features 8 moves

RATING: 7
You're just going to have to take it on faith that I am not being obtuse when I say that this is an abstract thematic Euro game. Because it is.

At heart this is a simple little area control game. There are eight turns in the game, and eight actions you can take, each action taken exactly once (but no requirement that you take one action per turn). Each action feels small but leaves unexpected echoes. And yet while it's aggressively minimalist and stroky-beardy, I find it weirdly evocative.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a neat, non-economic stock holding game that is reminiscent of Carolus Magnus, and I can't really decide which one I like better.  Both are of that rules are so simple but gameplay is so deep variety that I think is where my gaming tastes really lie.

There are some really tough decisions to make, since your actions are limited to 8 per game.  When do you make a push for control?  How will the butterfly effects limit your options later in the game.  Good, tense gameplay.

AS a side note, I think I would like the historical theme of King of Siam over this one, but the price point was perfect, so who am I to nit-pick?

In the end, I preferred the (no-luck variant) Carolus Magnus over this for the two tiered stock control system and the merging end game timer.  I will miss the tense 8 action system and the susceptibility of group-think in the King is Dead, but I don;t need two games that do the same thing for me.

This is a little gem of game design. It is a pity the poor production value. So few rules and so many hard decisions. I like very much the crossed timing between area cards and actions. Your actions limit your plans but you can be creative on where and how to do them. Great. Poorer rank than King of Siam because of production value.

The game has 6 different win conditions (more if you count multiple ties). In the early game, trying to decide which of these to steer the game toward felt inconsequential. Games of chicken sometimes have arbitrary-feeling moves at the beginning, before anyone stakes a claim, so perhaps that just comes with the territory.

Having all 8 action cards available from the beginning means you can play too many cards too early, eliminating too much uncertainty before the end of the game gets near. You have to restrain yourself.

Playing a perfect-information game with three players means inviting kingmaker scenarios, which we encountered (despite the rule about not playing the last card).

The feelings I got when I played the first two times were: (1) I should spend a long time examining the board before I decide to act; (2) I should delay acting whenever possible; and (3) None of the remaining cards I have can help my position in a way that can't be undermined. These feelings weren't pleasant.

This isn't my cup of tea.

RATING: 5
This is pure area majority. You all have the same 7 cards and you play 7 rounds. The game is played on a board showing a number of regions. A card will determine how you move units around the board as you attempt to get majorities in the regions. The clever bit is that you want a majority in the colour which you have the most armies of in front of you. The problem is you use those armies to place on the board to get majorities. So the more you place of a colour on to the board the better that colour will do on the board but the fewer you will have in front of you. Big dilemma!

In reality it seemed to play out that the first 5 rounds (of 7) were a bit pointless as everyone was setting themselves up for an endgame, but after 5 rounds everyone was on an equal footing. In the endgame it is SO tight that all the players had the similar majorities of colours in front of them and on the board. In that case the winner is determined by who doesn't play the last card.


The King Is Dead is a real brain burner toward the end, but it doesn't seem to organically grow into that position. You move stuff around for half an hour then suddenly you have to exactly work out when to play your last card in the last two rounds and your brain melts. 

The rules states that cards which are played are hidden, meaning those with a good memory will be served better. I would suggest playing with open cards to avoid this.

However, nothing (NOTHING) can beat the palpable tension that you feel when playing live.

One 2p play. Initial impression is relative ambivalence. There is definitely a decent game here, just not one I am initially compelled by. One needs to play a few times to grok what it's all about; initial explanation leaves one at a loss how to approach it.

For an abstract, they could have put a little flavor into the artwork but the graphics are dreadfully dry and without character, which doesn't help it.

Though not compelled, I am intrigued and will try a few more times.

Essen 15 purchase - Not as heavy as box art implies, certainly more abstract than theme, but an interesting brain burner. I like the threat of Saxons elements. So far, only three, but It's ok (but not brilliant). Rating 7.186 (Nov 15). UPDATE: With four its a different game, probably not as good as three, but still interesting. Actually, there is something really intersting about how minimalist and almost slightly empty the game is, and yet it still works quite well. Increase rating to 7.685 (Dec 2015).

Love the game, especially with 4 players. But here are a few notes on the first edition from Osprey Games: The quality of the box, board, rules, card stock, and overall presentation are very good. However, there are some warts from this new game publisher: faction tokens are very thin cardstock not chipboard, cubes are not standard Euro shape and have 4 rounded edges, some cards aren't properly color corrected, the fabric bag is partially see-through (not a major issue), and at least in my copy, the rules booklet was rippled due to excessive moisture. Don't let any of this dissuade you from buying the game, as it is excellent, but just be prepared that the quality of this edition is a bit uneven.

The simplicity of the game play and rules can fool you not thinking this is a light weight game. I say it's a fast-playing, mostly abstract deep strategy game.

A very brain burning area control game.  You gain control of a faction by removing the faction from the map and placing it on your player mat; but this reduces the strength of that faction on the map.  Your goal is to control the strongest faction, do each time you vie for control, you weaken your faction.

Both players begin the game with 8 identical action selection cards. You may only pick up a faction cube if you play a card.  Only eight difficult choices to make; but it makes for a wonderfully tense game.

Dropped it from an 8 to a 6.  Ties are a little too frequently and I don't enjoy calculating the tie-breakers.  It felt like doing my taxes.  For a brain burner, I'd rather do Arboretum.

Ultimately this game really disappointed me.

I thought it was going to be a clever game of 7 actions to have on stand-by as a strategic filler. Unfortunately each game has been decided by the last 3 regions only. Surprisingly (and I've played it with 8 different people) it also seems to produce a ridiculous amount of AP. Sure players get quicker the more you play but you may as well save your cards until the end, that's it. It also can suffer from being a bit of a luck fest and has a kingmaker problem.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Such an interesting game. You have to remove cubes from the board to have that factions majority but at the same time that leaves fewer of that color to win. It's like you're working against yourself the whole game. Very unique, I have yet to play the team variant though.

RATING: 7
You play as a courtsman after King Arthur died.
Whenever you take an influence, you strengthen your chances to win if that faction wins, but you weaken them on the board.

Can be very tense on the end, but can end in kingmaking if the last player can't win with his last order/card.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Although its rules are simple, The King is Dead is not a gateway game by any means. Each player is continuously faced with puzzling tactical decisions in a clever abstract game in which, after the setup, luck plays (pour ainsi dire) no part.

For some reason it's not easy for people to get their heads round the victory condition of having the most followers of the faction that has the most territory. I think it may be because the cards allow such limited options that people feel confused and disempowered. 

Perhaps the simplest way to grasp its main concept is if you imagine a game of insider trading on the stock market. You manipulate the share prices of 3 different companies, but every time you buy a share in a company, you slightly weaken (!) its position in the market. 

In The King is Dead, you manipulate the support for 3 different factions in various areas of post-Arthurian Britain, but every time you convince a follower of a faction to support your own bid for power, you slightly weaken the position of that supporter’s faction in the country. 

You only have 8 cards to play in the whole game, and unless you play them well, you may find yourself powerless as the game enters its final stages. Hand management, area control, and stock market trading mix exceptionally well in this intriguing and exasperating game. 

While the rules are short, they are not all that easy to understand or explain. They start like this: "In The King is Dead players do not play as the Scots, Welsh or Romano-British factions." This is true, but it is disconcerting to enter the rules in reverse gear.

2015-10-13 - 7 - Very nice looking, quick (about 20 minutes) area control game with very limited number of actions per player. It works really good with three players. I'm not very good at it - it requires a lot of patience and careful planning - you cannot focus too much on every single conflit but need to look wider for the whole war.

2016-02-08 - 7->6 - It's not as exciting as I would like it to be and I'm not too eager to play it. I feel too little control there as well. Still, I might play it some time.

A game with simple yet unintuitive rules(and I mean that in the best way possible). The King Is Dead manages to do a good job of forcing every player to balance competing political concerns without getting bogged down in complex minutiae.

Szerintem bámulatosan egyszerű eszközökkel hoz létre igazán izgalmas döntési helyzeteket. Pár perces szabály, és a játékidő is 20-30 perc kettesben, gyakorlatilag filler kategória, de közben meg mégsem érződik annak. Valószínűleg hármasban még jobb, illetve a Mordred variánst nem próbáltuk.

RATING: 7.5
(This game is a new implementation of King of Siam)

This is an interestingly different type of game. I enjoy the tension between acting and playing passive, and the ways they you try and posture and subtly position yourself through a very limited set of actions.

How and when you use cards is interesting and I expect there is a lot of depth in here for those who are truly good to work over the novices with, but I'm still to explore it.

It seems to be a very interesting partnership game, and is more energetic as such than in the three player game.

I enjoy the design and components of this edition. While the theme is a little generic compared to the original it's still serviceable for the mechanics.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

This is quite interesting as a partnership game. The different winning conditions can lead to different strategies but be sure you understand the winning conditions before playing so you make your decisions wisely. Everyone has the same hand of cards and can play them at any time - but once you are out of cards, you are out of the game.

It is a sad thing that there are not many interesting board games that play in teams. This one can play as 2x2 and it is one of those elegant games that play very quickly (less than an hour, actually). This will definitely go to the upper part of my wishlist.

What a superb game.  I felt excited and intrigued while playing it.  It is fun with different player counts, including with teams.  I am just beginning to discover it and I want to play it again.  So far I sense that this strategic no-luck game feels open to different strategies.  I like how you have to embrace the whole board while planning for the future.  I like the asymmetrical timing of play at each player's control.  I like the length (short, about 30 mins max) and the ease of the rules and the elegance of the play -- the game can get out of the way of the players so that the players can simply play, like all great strategy games (Chess, Go, etc.).  The game mechanics is very unique.  This rating might increase if the initial promise holds.

Rating based on 3 and 4 players.

Simple and short, but very think-y. Goals constantly shift, and you have to keep an interesting balance between power on the board vs. your court, and playing cards to press an advantage vs. saving them for later (the limit of 8 actions per game  makes every choice count!).  I feel like I've only scratched the surface of this, would love to play this more often.

RATING: 7
It turns out I like games where I sit down with a clear understanding of the rules (in the case of this game not a very hard thing to achieve, with the caveat that the tie-breakers are all important and need to be kept in mind at all times and are the most wordy, though not complicated, thing in the game) and then have no idea what to do. You don't even have all that many options, play a card (one of eight) or pass, but the ramifications and the strategic implications were completely opaque to me on my first try. It's great!

The core of this game is that you are not one of the three factions, instead you are trying to have the majority of the strongest faction at the end of the game, but whenever you gain influence with a faction you weaken that faction's presence on the board. Also, you have a strict limit of eight cards with no redraw, and you are resolving the eight regions one at a time and once locked in it's set for the game. So you have to stay "liquid" at all times and see where the game takes you, and you can't even blame luck as there isn't any after setup.

I think this game is a great thinky abstract and I suspect it will shine even more in the partnership game for 4 players. I'm looking forward to exploring it more. A great game!

I love the simplicity and tenseness of the gameplay--eight cards to play, when and how you choose. Not so good is the fact that deciding a winner comes down to a large decision tree of fiddly tiebreakers: there are 2 alternate scenarios, various extra rules, plus a supplementary rule that, ironically for a game with this theme, rules out king-making on the final move. I've found that for a game this simple it can be surprisingly hard for players to grasp the rules and strategy. But it's nonetheless well worth checking out the game.

One thing to watch out for: this reimplements King of Siam, and while it's basically a very nice edition, it is VERY hard without close inspection to determine which regions in the bottom half of the map are contiguous, which matters a LOT for some action cards.

The double majority struggle of the King is Dead, where you need majority in majority factions, reminds of Carolus Magnus. While Carolus Magnus has a shrinking game board, The King is Dead has a shrinking number of available action cards, and the players must constantly weigh actions now against future actions. In addition, the victory conditions are dependent on the gameplay so the players must constantly assess whether to focus on one faction only (in case that faction gains majority) or all factions (in case no faction gains majority). A surprisingly deep game in spite of "only" eight actions.

Fascinating and pared-down area control and doublethink that pretty much only works with 3P. With so few cubes in the game, it's hard to believe it could work, but strangely it seems to, which I suppose is the legacy of strong playtesting. Several plays will be necessary to get to grips with the slightly labyrinthine tie-break rules.

King Arthur is dead! And now his knights divide up his kingdom, spreading influence and consolidating power with the warring factions of Britain. For such a low price and simple components, I was surprised to see how much strategy and fun was in the game. The game is played with partners as you both play cards which move influence around the board. Essentially, it's a betting game where teams put their stock in one faction being the ultimate victor; this game is all tactics and very little given to randomization or luck! Great game!

Another shining example of  minimalist design crammed with depth.  You only get 8 actions the entire game, but you will feel like you played 20 actions.  You are trying to collect influence in the faction you think will win control of Britain, but as you collect influence, you are weakening that faction.  Conserving actions for opportune moments is one of several keys to winning this game.  And don't let anyone tell you the team play at the 4 player count is suboptimal.  We played a team game and it was a thrill.

I love how perfectly aligned all the elements of this game are. It is so minimal, yet everything is perfect. You have 8 cards, and these are all the actions you get to take in the game. You can play them at any time. You could play all 8 the first turn if you want! Or you can hold onto them to the point where they are now irrelevant. A beautiful tradeoff built into the very fabric of the game. Timing is everything.

The indirection between the supremacy of the colors and each player's relative strength in each color is a beautiful dance, and leads to such interesting interplay between focusing and diversifying your stakes. Going all in on yellow means everyone else will tank yellow, but maybe you were doing it so everyone *would* tank yellow, because really you are angling for blue!

When you play an action, you mess with the board state, then take a cube off the board to gain influence over that color. So gaining influence in a color reduces its presence on the board... which is maybe what you were trying to do!

A beautiful game, as close to perfect as I have ever seen a design.

pseudo stock market game, where there are three colored cubes on the board. Each turn, whichever faction has the most cubes gets a win for that region. At the end of the game a player wins if he has the most cubes matching the color that won the most. The game lasts 8 rounds, and all players can do on their turn is spend one of their 8 once-per-game cards to carry out the card's effect and then remove a cube from the board adding it to their stock, or pass. What this means is, since each player gets the same set of cards, and since your taking a cube weakens the faction you then want to have succeed, this game quickly devolves into an unpredictable mess. Since you will only ever have 8 cubes, getting a cube in the wrong color is pretty much the end of you. Really no flexibility, and tension of who spends their cards first is more frustrating than fun.

King of Siam is one of my favorite games, and because this game is nearly identical in rules, of course I think this game is great.  The small tweak to the map makes blue a slightly more viable faction, which is good.  However, the random pull for starting cubes is not a rule I like.  It has the potential for one person to start the game with an advantage if the other two start with the same cubes (in a 4-player game the same thing can happen if teammates match cubes).  Also, the theme from King of Siam was more interesting.  And the map card design was better in King of Siam, because you could identify the contested area by the map position at a glance, instead of by color from a close-up of the area.  So King of Siam is a slightly better version of this great, great game.

Played once, with two players.

A short game dense with interesting decisions.

Players manipulate three factions for dominance of England. The player with the most influence in the dominant faction at the end of the game, wins. However increasing influence in a faction also weakens its presence on the board. Players must balance increasing their influence in a faction with having it able to dominate.

RATING: 9
My favorite moment in this game, experienced time and again with different groups, is when one player can't quite come to grips with the fact that their best move is to pass. They agonize over it for minutes, we stare at them, make faces, until finally they put their cards down and say they don't know what to do.

"Do you want to pass?"

And then they sigh, and pick their cards back up.

Eventually they make a play, voicing their discontent but unable to place the words. Not entirely happy with how they don't feel any closer to winning, but they must be? They look around at how their opponents are coping. I pass, the next player passes, and suddenly it's their turn again. They gob up some more air.

The win conditions and the tiebreakers are hard to tease apart without some serious teaching and player aids, but the gameplay is worth it. I love this game for forcing me to change my approach each time my opponent makes a smart play.

3 player game about investing in 3 factions fighting for area control majority. Clear? Oh and you only have a set of 8 one time actions to do it. And every time you strengthen your influence in a faction, you weaken the faction. Are we having fun yet? 

It's very nonobvious at start - things fall into place with repeated plays. Each action has such an impact, so you have to get a feel for this. And you can't go solo - it's a sort of shared incentives kinda thing with only one winner (ha!). Interesting compact design (but not minimal, nope.)

The visuals and the theme are disappointing (quality poor, colour palette dull, choice of theme - why? Was nothing more generic available?). Yeah, I'd rather have King of Siam (rating would be higher)

It's a quick game with few rules, but lots of interesting decisions. It's a surprisingly brain-burning game. I haven't quite wrapped my head around it, so there's the potential for this rating to go up.

This rating is from a single play of a 4 player game. It just feels completely broken at 4 players. The optimal move seems to be to do nothing until near the very end when you can play and compensate based on what the opponent has done. Waiting until the enemy makes a small mistake and then pouncing on it with all your cards. When the best move is to do nothing then the game becomes boring and stagnate. I definitely think it will be better with 3 players as then there is more push and pull between the factions, but at 4 players it seems to be determined by the very initial start of the draw and board position if players know near optimal moves (each teammate focuses on 1 of the 3 factions and just ensures either one of those 2 factions wins when possible such that if I want red to win my partner ensures that happens while I collect red, and vice versa for my teammate's chosen faction).

RATING: 7
Very thinky game with just a few rules.  Having a total of 8 actions throughout the entire game really makes you have to very carefully consider your moves.  Every action is so important.  In my single game, I needed to keep track of my opponents remaining cards, bluff, orchestrate ties, and force moves by passing.  I'll start my rating at a 7 but can easily see it increasing.

I really liked this one. There's a balance between taking off the support you want to back and weakening the associated faction in the process.

Très bon jeu rapide (30' maxi par partie), subtil et avec une très bonne rejouabilité ; on peut en faire huit de suite sans se lasser.
Ça n'a rien d'une simulation, le thème historique est plaqué mais donne quand-même un peu de ressenti d'époque. Le système sous-jacent est un petit bijou, quoique très simple dans ses règles.

Abstract strategy in medieval England.  This is the first game that I wrote a review for.  I am always eager to play this game.  It is as engaging as chess, but it does not require encyclopedic knowledge of the game in order to be compete and enjoy.  I own a beautiful edition produced by Osprey Games.  It was originally called "King of Siam," but I have never played that version.

RATING: 8
Very simple game to learn and quick to play but with a lot of depth for one so small. You are trying to gain the most influence with the 1 of 3 factions on the board who will eventually hold the most of the 8 regions in Britain and make you King Arthur's successor.

RATING: 7
Economy of components/elegance: there's a board, some cubes, some tokens, and some cards. That's it. It reminds me of a Michael Schacht or Mac Gerdts game in that regard, because those guys can usually pack a lot of game into very few components. I love this type of elegance in a game.

After a two-player game it seems like the game is meant for 3-4 players. With two players, since you only have eight actions and there's no randomness outside of the initial setup, the game is basically solvable. Not right from the start, but after a couple of turns you could technically work out who could win based on the cards that have been played.

Update: Finally played a 3-player game and it was a huge improvement. A lot more uncertainty and much tougher decisions about when to pass.

Reworking of the game King of Siam, originally published by Histogames.

Was MUCH cheaper than King of Siam, which will NOT be reprinted according to the publisher. Even though I probably would have preferred that theme. Oh well, the Arthurian thing works well enough here and keeps to pseudo-history rather than outright fantasy.

Quick-playing, simple, area control game that works best with 3 players. I like the way the cards are always the same and the problems are always the same and yet there's a sense of many possibilities.

I have no idea what I'm doing yet in this game, but I like it.

This game is a re-implementation of Konig Von Siam. It's a little different in that the location and map are different, there's a different way the start position is seeded, the art and production quality are better, and there's a variant/expansion included with the game (that we didn't play).

This is a quick area control game with two distinctly different ways to win. The game is only eight rounds long (although it can end earlier) and you only have 8 cards, which is how you take actions in the game. The game revolves around three factions (red, blue and yellow) that are trying to take control of the majority of England. Every round, one province will be resolved (and you can see the order that these will happen).

Players take turns playing a card. Every time you play a card, you do the associated action, which generally puts out cubes or switches cubes around, and then remove a cube from the board. You're free to pass, and jump back in later, but if everyone passes consecutively the round ends and control is determined. Once a region has been evaluated the cubes from that region leave the board and nothing can ever influence that region again.

The cube you take after playing a card becomes your follower and contributes to your dominance of that faction. If you control the faction that controls the most territory at the end of the game, then you win. So there's a little bit of a weirdness in that you want to remove cubes of a certain color to take control of that faction, but that inherently weakens their board position.

Of course, there's another way to win, which involves ties. If there is ever a tie for control, no faction wins and the Saxons invade. If the Saxons invade four times, the game immediately ends and the winner is the player with the most sets of rainbows (red, blue and yellow cubes).

The play of the game is really interesting. Obviously with eight cards to last eight rounds, you can't do everything you want. So you have to pick and choose your battles and figure out how to use your actions to best effect.

In our play, we hit a wonky situation where one player took control of the yellow faction, but ran out of cards on the sixth round. All three factions controlled 2 provinces. The other two players battled it out to try and make red or blue win their third country, but ended up forcing ties. According to the rules, the tie for who controls the country when the number of provinces is the province that last won a control contest. So the player who had run out of cards and been sitting around doing nothing for two rounds ended up winning... which is a bit of strangeness.

Very interesting area control game. Plays fast, but can be a brain burner. Requires some nimbleness, as you may need to switch sides half-way through the game. Everyone who has played this really enjoyed it. Surprised this has such little buzz.

This game is a little different.  On starting a game, it is not clear to me what I want to or should do.  But it is not a befuddlement about rules or play  - actions are limited and the goal is straightforward - it is the way the play and goals will shift with other players' actions. This game appeals to me because its starkness of choices yields varied and changing strategies, and it plays out relatively quickly.

Still early on plays of this game, but it seems amazingly good so far.  An extremely elegant game that makes every decision interesting.

Edit 7/30:  Have played several more times online and in person and it keeps getting better.  One of the best designs I've ever played.  Love this game.

RATING: 7.5
The 9 is for the 4 player game. 

update:  it's probably just an 8.  There's a lot of game here and it's wonderful but maybe too opaque for its own good.  Tension increases as the game goes on.  I'm not sure yet.  i don't like the 3 player game as much.

update:  it's easy to look at possible tactics, but none of them seem to ever have certainty.  way too much to calculate.  lowered again.  but it will stay above a 7 because it's so fast to play and gives a lot of game.

ultimately this is an investment game.  I'm finding it so hard with the possible card tactics to make sense of it.  it does improve if everyone keeps their cards in front of them.  helps you visualize possible moves.

A very clever design, possibly one of the smartest pieces of game design I've encountered.

It is intense and I revel in the brilliance of the design but I'm not sure if I enjoy it as much as admire it. More plays will tell.

This is a remake of King of Siam, but nothing is changed but the map and setting, which now reflects the Saxon invasion of England. The game itself plays like a hyper-concentrated El Grande. Players have a hand of 8 cards used to deploy cubes to the map and when they run out, they can't affect the board state for the rest of the game. Additionally, every time a card is played the acting player must remove a cube from the map and place it in front of them. This cube acts like a "share" in one of the games three factions. At the end of each round, a territory is scored for the faction that has majority and locked for the rest of the game. After all regions have scored, the faction that has the most territories won gives the player that has the most shares of that faction the win.

It's very clever in that the more shares in a faction you take, the weaker you make that faction's board presence and lessening the chance they will winin. Also, as the areas are scored the map gets tighter and tighter making almost every card play produce a series of agonizing decisions.

The game also has a neat four player variant, in which players form two teams that must compete, but without the teammates being able to communicate with each other in any way. It becomes a real test of the player's ability to read his ally's intentions and make tough decisions to support them without working at cross purposes.

Strategic area control on British Isles game board. Card driven placement and movement of colored cubes. Each player has the same deck of action cards to get majority of each of eight territories while getting backing from the winning factions. Interesting game end condition with the Saxons. I don't get the connection to the King Arthur theme? A bit dry for our group.

A bland-looking combination of area control and ... I guess set collection, of sorts.  Component quality is actually pretty bad ... it's a board and cubes and super thin cardboard tokens a bunch of cards that like to stick together.  Not much to it.  However, gameplay is pretty awesome. It's almost chess like, where you're playing the other players as much as you're playing the game. Each player will perform a maximum of 8 actions throughout the game. It plays relatively quickly (20-30 minutes, if that), which is great. This was a pleasant surprise for such a low cost.

"Never sell or trade games shelf" - Another gem. I love games where every move actually matters....unlike most euro type games where you make a bunch of silly-worthless moves and don't feel satisfied in the end. Highly recommended.

Settlers with cards, and better art.  The upgrades made possible by the KickStarter project really paid off.  The Meeples used in this game are cool.  Game play is quick and straightforward, all of which is presented in a very effective, and mercifully short, rule book.

Starts as a card draft, then moves on to resource management with a dab of worker placement, at least in terms of playing "craftsmen" from your hand to allow the construction of ships.  It ends with Victory Point counting and bragging rights!

The art on this game is AMAZING for a genre that typically has dark, hyper-real art of vikings. The style is definitely one I hope to see again. 

The game is fairly light, for all the trimmings that make it seem like a euro economic game. 

This game would appeal to people trying to introduce other players to drafting and "engine-building" games. With only one hand to pass around in the draft it's more understandable to beginners than other drafting games.

It's really inexcusable that the original game was almost broken as published, and had to be fixed with an expansion. With the expansion, the game is at least playable now. Unfortunately, the arbitrary attack cards and excessive game length, combined with its overly-luck-driven card system, prevents me from ever wanting to play ever again. Sold.

Fun at first but then some things started annoying me/us: it got extremely hard to make plans since other players constantly sabotage you and it's not easy to turn your strategy around (you can even be completely blocked if you're not careful.)

Also, the game was way longer than expected: almost 2h30. It should be way shorter for what it is, in my opinion. The rules would benefit from some tweaking (more workers would definitely help speed up the game and adding the possibility to switch boats/workers to avoid being stuck for several turns would help counter the sabotages.)

A great game from Kickstarter. Enjoyed the card drafting mechanic, made for a quick game with minimal downtime. If I had to pick one thing to critic, it would be that from time to time, some card choices were pointless (e.g. I have two ships in the workshop already and I'm choosing between two ships cards). Would be nice to be able to burn these for a gold or something.

2016-11-28 : Drafting game where you're at the mercy of the cards you get. And while it may look like there's an engine building element in this game, there really isn't - going for an extra gold or worker with the low-value ships is mathematically the wrong move. Typical KickStarter that wasn't developed/playtested enough. The expansion mitigates the luck to a degree that the game becomes playable - don't play without it.

Fúúúú, rég játszottam ennyire rossz játékkal. A legkellemetlenebb "naveledkibaszok" típus megfűszerezve egy hatalmas adag szerencsével, beszorulási lehetőséggel. Érthetetlen, hogy miért nem normális draft van a játékban, ami legalább némileg csökkenthetné a szerencse szerepét. 
Mindezekhez a játékidő hosszú a játékmenet vontatott. A "naveledkibaszok"  miatt királycsinálás ezerrel. Uhh, ritkán érzek ilyet, de ezt látni nem akarom többet. :)
A kieggel játszottunk, ami állítólag sokat javít rajta. Hát el se tudom képzelni, milyen lehet nélküle.

Another game that jumps on the "drafting" train and yet another that doesn't impress me at all. There's way to much luck involved and to many "take that" elements that screw you, while the game takes way to long for what it does.

players should get the ressources way faster to make the game actually fun and intersting. As it is, every single ressource is a pain to get and if you build a big ship fast, you'll suffer for quite some time, if not until the end of the game, as you will be short by 1 Viking each round.

Works, but you can feel that there wasn't a real publisher behind it.

Having played about six or seven games, it seems to a bit too random who wins the game, because it feels almost impossible to get to build a ship without being protected by a watchman. The add-on really improves the that aspect, but the overall feeling is still that the game is okay, but not great.

"Overall, Shipwrights of the North Seas is a decent game, in my opinion. I really think the art style is quite striking and the market mechanic is super interesting, but I find some aspects of the gameplay frustrating, as you spend a fairly long time building up resources only to have them burnt down by other players. If you make a serious mistake, you could get hit with a major setback or get ganged up on. Unfortunately, that's a major component of the game; you need to burn a ship or assassinate a Craftsperson if you want to be able to stave off your opponent's fleet. As a result, I think that this is a great game for people who enjoy a lot of head-to-head combat and trying to plan a strategy amidst some aggressive player actions, and I still think it's solid enough to occasionally play (the extra actions from the Expansion board help), but I wish it were a bit quicker to gain resources so that the game didn't last quite as long. That said, if you're looking for a neat game with a cool market mechanic and you like the art style, this might be worth checking out!"

Good but the negative cards are way too damaging which, unless someone gets picked on (who won't enjoy it), the pain gets spread around and no-one builds a ship for hours.  We were not playing slowly but went a long, long  way over the supposed 60 minutes, and we'd only built 2 ships by the time we called it a day.

Drafting and resource management game where you are building three ships.  Each turn you draft three cards and use all that you can. Most provide resources, money, special helpers, ships or attack cards.  You typically work on one ship at a time. You have to balance workers which generate money with building new ships.  Some ships grant small advantages. A pretty fun little game. Nothing really new here but a good game to play if you only have an hour or so.

Way too much randomness/luck in involved:
3 card draft, but one at a time - made worse by hard limits on # of ships and crafters.
probably worse is all the "take that" cards and then the randomness of the market (with the high cost).
finally, it always takes longer than it should.   
nice components and not hard to learn, just not smooth enough.

We like this game.  It has the same level of complexity and table footprint as other small/tight economy games like My Happy Farm.  But this game definitely allows players to mess with other players' plans (cancel contracts or materials to fulfill contracts).  So I would only play this 2 player or with folks who can handle confrontation.

Components, art, box, game flow, and economy engine are good.  I normally trash boxes, but I may keep this one.

My only complaint against the game are some of the inconsistencies and a couple of details you need to remember:
* Capacity (Mill & Worker) checks done at end of turn, so you can temporarily exceed during the turn (not a complaint, but need to remember).
* Mill buffs modify Mill CAPACITY, but Worker buffs modify worker population RATE, not capacity.  However, their symbols are similar (Mill/Worker icons with up arrow).  I can see people mistaking the Worker buff for capacity.
* Gold buffs should have an arrow, since they increase Gold rate, to maintain parallelism with Worker buffs.  But a white arrow in the Gold icon would be hard to see.

* Ships you are working on and Craftsmen on your board can only leave via fulfillment of contracts or special cards, but tools can be overridden.

* You can build multiple of same boat types, but only 1 of each building.

It's these little inconsistencies that keep me from giving this game top marks and the game will need a refresher game after not having played a while.  But once you remember all of these little things, it's a great game.

Remember to have a temporary face down discard for the draft leftover cards, so you don't know what other players are picking during the draft.

Notable game features:
* points from boats (primarily) and buildings (secondary)
* openness of actions requires players to sequence action choices properly
* very easy to screw up your economy engine
* the backs of the cards are also the market (shows what and how many materials can be bough).  Since the backs are varied, you again have to keep proper sequencing of actions in mind before doing something that draws cards.
* fulfilled contracts (boats) can give less VP for more benefits, or more VP and hurt your economy engine

Con dos jugadores es completamente aleatorio, sin ningún tipo de estrategia o control sobre tu partida.

A good resource management/hand management game. Card drafting means you always have a choice of doing what is best for yourself, or screwing someone else out of something you know they need. If everyone focus's on the Gotcha side of things, the game can drag on. Building ships give different benefits, so there are always a few strategies to look at. Very enjoyable game.

It is the weakest of the North Sea trilogy, but it's also the historically first. Still, the game is kinda cute and nothing to be offended about, when one is an experienced gamer.
Just the player interaction can be quite frustrating and the game isn't something I imagine I will crave to play often. But I'm glad to own it.

Great game. Playable in 45-60 minutes, plays well with anywhere from 2 to 5 players which is nice.

Great artwork and theme.  I really liked the gameplay with the card drafting and resource collecting to build your ships. While a like games with conflict, some of the take that cards can really set you back which adds to the length of the game. I am looking forward to another play but with 2 or 3 players instead of 4.

I own all the expansions and play with them. The original game without the Townsfolk, I would give a 6-7 as there are limits to how you can build and you are relying on luck to get a particular craftsman. The expansions, particularly the villagers that allow you to protect boats and exchange craftsmen, are fun and really add to the game. This one is easy to learn, relatively fast (30-45 minutes), and every player achieves something in the end. This is easily my favorite of the North Sea collection.

Rating is based on playing with the 'Shipwrights of the North Sea: The Townsfolk Expansion' expansion; In fact I can't imagine playing this without this expansion (you can get a FREE PnP-version here on BGG), as that adds a lot of flexibility.

RATING: 5
Played twice, won twice but still not wild about this. 

A Viking themed resource gathering to build longboats game, light and quick with reasonable interaction. The goal is to earn VPs by building various boats and buildings. Peach require gold,a number of workers and resources all of which are collected each turn. A card drafting mechanic means that the is a reasonable chance of getting something useful on each of your turns and the game moves along reasonably quickly. However you will still find yourself sainting for the right combination of cards to turn up, especially the craftsmen. 
Overall mildly diverting, light but not one I would look to buy.

A great card crafting game. This is the first in the North Sea series and you can tell by the length of the game and some game play decisions but an essential to experience the wonder of the Rune Sage. The Townsfolk expansion which was also released highly improves the gameplay, adding choices which stop situations where you wouldn't have anything to do. I won't play without it.

The amount of Take That in the game is the exact thing that slows the game down for us. If there were any possible way that the Take That aspect of the game was separate from the Card Drafting mechanic, it may have made the game a little fast. That's our only gripe, but that gripe is why we've rated Shipwrights a 6.

This game was not playtested, if it was then I'm even more shocked how poorly they finished the game. All the ridiculous "take that" just makes the game much longer than it should be.

Nice components & artwork. Basic mechanics sounded good, but OMG is this boring once you realize that you simply can't accumulate resources fast enough! We quit after one person finally built his 3rd ship. Needing to burn two workers PLUS two gold to buy resources makes this a real snoozefest, especially with all of the screwage cards. You HOPE you draw the craftsman you need AND can keep them long enough to build one of the two ships you're committed to. VERY easy to stop your opponents, especially when it is so difficult to get what you need. 
This game needs new rules if we are to ever try it again.
I doubt I will keep the game that long.

Yep. 2nd play just as boring. This game is history.

UPDATE: THE TOWNSFOLK EXPANSION IS A MUST! Makes the game a 6.

Beautiful artwork, but otherwise a terrible game. Like so many Kickstarter titles, the ideas here are interesting, but the implementation simply falls flat. You have to manage so many items to get a ship built and it's easy enough for your opponents to mess with you that the game can drag on and on. Since you are limited rather severely on your resources, you also can't protect against the untimely disruption in your plans, plus once you've built a ship, it is several turns before you're able to come close to getting another one. Workers are used for far too many things, and once you use them up, it takes several turns generally to get them back again (and generate a corresponding income).

[Garphill Games Kickstarter 14 edition] {Viking; card-drafting, resource management; optional 3p} This is a cute little game with many player interactions.  Players keep on attacking each other, while building their own village and ships.  But I think it's too easy to mess your players so that they can't build a ship easily, especially each ship requires so many resources and craftsmen.  Thus, the game may run a little bit too long.

I like the illustration.  The quality of game components is exceptional too.  This is a nice production.

RATING: 6.5
tl;dr: been there, done that

This is one of those games that just feels like so many other games, just with a different theme. Gather some resources, convert them into points with 'order' cards. And in this case, it doesn't do anything new or exciting. It all works fine, but nothing about it stands out. So it's not bad, there's nothing wrong, but there's no real good reason to play this over similar games.
Oh yeah, there is a certain luck of the draw going on, but I didn't think it was too much.

I won't rate this game yet, since I've only played it once, with 5 players, with the Townsfolk expansion. I really like what this game is about and how it is played, but the pace of the game was just waaaaay too slow. I don't know if this is due to the fact that we played it with 5, I suppose it plays faster with less players. But the game dragged on forever, because it proved to be really hard to get all the things needed to get your ships out (and the only way to end the game is if one player gets 4 ships afloat), especially since attacks can put you back, by either removing gold (Raider action), or stealing one of your specialists, or destroying a ship in your workshop (Barbarian action) you had just spent turns to get the right workers and resources for. The game does offer ways to protect yourself from those attacks, but you might not have that protection when you most need it. We are not AP prone players, turns moved rather quickly, and yet it still took us 3 hours to finish. And that is too long for the spirit an weight of this game. I do want to try it with 3 or 4 players, to see how that goes. Because I had a lot of fun with this... in the first hour at least.

Easy to learn game with beautiful components at a very reasonable price. Compact box, no oversized mumbo jumbo. Quick set up. 

I usually love games with take that, but in this game it seems to slow down game play too much. At some point you feel like you don't want to sabotage your opponent's plans, so the game would end. Too long for what it is.

I love the aesthetic of this and Garphill's other Viking Trilogy games. I love the art, the production values, I enjoy the mechanics, it's fun to play - the problem I have at the moment is that I've been playing exclusively 2-player, and it drags a bit. I couldn't decide between rating this a 6 or 7 on that basis. I'd love to try with 3+ players as I think the interaction will improve things immensely.

This game tends to get frustrating at times with not having much to do on your turn or you feel like you didn't do a lot. It's all about the right cards to draft and you can get stuck with some terrible stuff depending on the player order. But the bits are great. The card play is pretty quick even though everybody does all their actions on their turn. There's a pretty good amount of take that in this game to that could ruin what your building up to.

The TAKE THAT aspects of the game (raiders or ship destruction) have devastating effects that make it difficult for players to recover. The game is over for them. Other than that issue -- it is a beautifully produced game that is entertaining.  Using the expansion is a absolute must
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
From the start I'd better make one thing clear: Buy the Townfolk Expansion! Don't play Ship Wrights without it.
The base game I'd rate a '5': a loooooooong (but very pretty) Nordic winter spent waiting for specific character cards to appear only to have a gleeful opponent play their assassin and send them straight to Valhalla...  Honestly, by the end of it I was about ready to see how many of the beautiful little meeples (Veeples?) I could fit up my nose.
With the expansion however it has a completely different feel: Still the same drafting and resource gathering, but now you can recruit workers faster AND there are methods to not only protect your precious cards, but also substitute them if need be.  Literally halved the playing time and took a game I'd rate a "meh" to one I enjoy a great deal.

This game has outstanding components and original, eye-catching art. Game play is smooth, once the rules are absorbed. The biggest flaw is that there are so many attack cards that make the game drag because players end up with their progress destroyed by an opponent and have to start over. I personally intend to remove most of the attack cards when playing, both to make the game less mean and to reduce the duration.

A painful game where you spend turn after turn accomplishing nothing but waiting for a ship or specific craftsmen card to show up in your hands and this drags on even more because the players ahead of you will cherry pick any good cards.  Then while you are waiting, your ships and craftsmen are sitting out for everyone to see so they can easily steal your resources, kill your craftsmen, and burn your boat destroying what little progress you made.  So the game drags on much longer than a game like this should.  About as much fun as playing Dominion with just curse and attack cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
Quite an odd drafting game. It has a fair amount of pick-a-player-and-do-this-thing-to-them, of which I am not a fan, but it also had some interesting aspects. Unfortunately, the variety of cards, combined with the complexity of the requirements to build ships (which thankfully is not the only way to score points), combined with the frequent opponent tear-down makes it frustratingly difficult to progress. Fortunately, there are safer ways to earn points… if those cards ever come around to you.

The art is very appealing, and there are worthwhile aspects to the game, but overall, it is not for me.

The mechanics of the game were so intriguing I ended up buying a copy of my own. I think it's primarily the mechanism of cost/trade of goods on the back of the cards to indicate the rising/falling cost of goods in a market. Such a simple, elegant solution. And the game was good besides, which helped.

Some Eurogamers might jump in joy that this game has no luck for movement, except for the movement of the dragon, for which they'll probably find a way to replace the dice. My impression was that it's quite boring to plan movement through grouping your knights on the fields of the map.

Nettes Spiel, was man gut mit Kindern auch spielen kann. Man muss seine Figuren über eine Strecke bis zum Ziel bringen udn dabei Schätze einsammeln. Möglichst nicht vom Drachen gefressen werden. Ziehen tut man soviele Felder wie man Figuren drauf hat. Also bissl Strategie ist auch gevon Nöten ;-) Aber der Langzeitspaß ist so lala, deshalb nur eine 6.

Very enjoyable game. It's light and several mechanics are extremely basic (even outdated), but there is a lot of tension, plenty of tactical play, and a few nice unique elements to keep things interesting. A lovely filler game.

Hmmm...I'd like to play this a lot more, but my intitial impressions are positive.  It's a good family game and has enough strategy in it to make it interesting.  The movement mechanism was copied in Pompeji.  I particularly like it thst young players have so many choices each turn, but in a manner that they can cope with...which pieces to move and in what order, which card to take, when to sacrifice a knight.  IThe game is fine with 3 player, but it's better with 4.  This is perfect for young minds to learn about Euro-style games.

More of a kid's game, but it sure is fun.    In 3 plays, the person who played first has always won.  Perhaps I wouldn't mind it if that was me.  Still, I wonder how much of an advantage that is.  More play required, I guess.

RATING: 7
Fun game with 2 or 3 players....much more luck based when you get to 5 (I really dont like 5 at this game, its 95% luck), but 3 player is great for those who like tactical yet quick games.

2 player is also even more tactical/chesslike, but with the random element of the dragon thrown in there.  

Great theme, the dragon is fun, and its always cool when you manage to avoid being eaten by the dragon.

Not just a kids game!  The way that the knights move is quite ingenious, and creates many tactical opportunities.  Kids could play it, but any adult who likes a fantasy theme should love this game, at least with 2-3 players so it isnt mostly luck based.  

I played this 100 times in 4 days on brettspielwelt...so it must be good.

It seems simple, and is very easy to teach, yet there is actually a fair amount of tactical depth to it when playing with only 2 or 3 players.  (for 2 player both people use 2 colors)

Pretty decent game with 3 or 4 players. The movement puzzle is interesting where you can only move a number of spaces equal to how many of your pawns you have on that space. My 11 year old daughter really likes it and has been playing for a number of years. My younger daughter is also getting into this one now the last couple years.

Thanks to BrettSpielWelt, I've gotten in a bunch more plays of this little gem (no pun intended), and have bumped my old 6 rating up to a 7.  It's never gonna set the gaming world on fire, but, well... I just dig it, and I'm usually ready to play again, right away, which is always a good sign.  Yeah, another player can throw the game somewhat by not "paying attention"... but never too badly, plus the luck of the Dragon rolls can throw the whole thing anyway, and hey, it's only 20-30 minutes long, so as long as everything works and the decisions are interesting (and it does, and they are, say I), how can you go wrong?

This game has just enough depth to keep us coming back, yet it is short and fast.  Someone on BGG compared it to Cartegena, with an additional layer of complexity.  Captures my sentiment well.

A light romp to discover treasure in a dragon's lair. 

This was a little too simple for me, but I could see this being fun to play with kids and non-gamers. It coudl also be a light filler while waiting for a group to arrive. It's easy to teach and plays fast. Our four player game lasted about 20 minutes.

Interesting set collection fantasy themed game. This game has a similar mechanic to Finca, where you move your knight spaces equal to the number of knights on the space. You are trying to get your knights as far as possible to collect the most expensive treasures while avoiding the dragon. Good game, but a little too light for my groups tastes. Hence, trade pile.

Light and quick with a fair amount of decision making, but not too much for the game to drag.  It's also not too long so the lack of serious depth doesn't get annoying.

A recent playing with five players has me thinking that it might work best with fewer than five. The scores could be broken up this way: the first and second player had the most points, by far, the third player was in the middle, and the last two players were hurting for points because so many of the spaces were cleared out by the time they got to the caves.

A nice little kids game of collecting treasure and avoiding the dragon.

If it were an adults game I would perhaps complain about the first player advantage and the imbalance between gold and jewels (it seems like you would almost always take the former over the latter), but that does not matter too much in a kids game.

Board and components are nice.

RATING: 4
This fell completely flat for me.  Ideally I would feel some danger and worry about the dragon moving around and threatening to eat my knights, but it's so easy to avoid it or any penalty, I just couldn't bring myself to care.  

It's a filler in board game form, and in that sense it has some value, I suppose.  But as a family game, or even as a kids game, I think it would come up short.

I bought this game for a few bucks, and for the price I think it was worth it as I got 3 plays out of it. However, it’s not that interesting a game and I don’t see myself play it a whole lot in the future. The mechanisms have been seen before (moving like in Finca, Pompeij etc.) but I think it’s a good mechanic. 

I liked how you were forced to make a decision between taking a gold card or a gem card which; a 4-5 gold card is almost always a no-brainer, but even though a gem card might be better than a 1-2 gold card, those lower value cards might come in handy when discarding them when the dragon is attacking you! And it will… Which I think is a nice touch and can make for some vicious moves by the other players and introduces some “push your luck” into the game. 
The gem cards, on the other hand, might be worth 5 points each if you’re the first to get one of each or has the most of each when the game ends. Speaking of the endgame, the game has ended in both ways in my games, and I like how it forces people to always pay attention to the end game conditions. 

While this might sound like a good game, something is missing. Granted, it plays rather quickly, so as a semi-filler it’s not bad; but it’s just not short enough to be a true filler, and as a quick “real” game it falls short.

We have played with 2 or 3 players.  3 is better, but 2 is still fun.  Determining how far you can move on your turn by how many pawns are in the same square is very clever and unique, as is the dragon's path.  My husband has terrible luck with the die, and tends to get eaten by the dragon, which he finds frustrating.

Something about this game makes me happy. As Mr. Grey advises me, I agree - it's not just a game for kids, it's a light game... So I will stop saying this is a kids' game. Still, this is my favorite game to play with kids--I rate it a 9 for that purpose. If I'm with a couple of kids, I usually want to play this game.  As a game for adults, ~7 or higher if in the mood for a fun light game.  I think it's better and more fun with 3-4 players than 5 (tentative). It plays fast (with less than 5 players), it's thematic, lively, colorful, with attractive bits.  It offers light strategy and mild tactics and several different mechanisms.  (The drifting zone of movement mechanism for the dragon is unique, as far as I know.) It even has a beginning, middle, and end. All that keeps my interest, and I think it's fun. However, the 5-player game may be too slow, something to avoid. You should hear the cheering when kids feed my knights to the baby dragon!  Arms in the air! I've played it with girls (not boys, just my circumstances) in kindergarten through 4th grade. I call the knight bonus card "the hunky man" to make them laugh, and that term has sticked. The kids seem to easily understand the issues of risk, card selections, card-or-knight sacrifice to the dragon, but have more difficulty with knight movement strategies, how to use moderation for net faster movement. [Simple 5 player variant for first turn only, to balance turn order advantage: first player moves normally; 2nd player moves normally + 1 additional move of any his/her pieces 1 space; 3rd player moves normally + 1 additional move of any one piece he/she owns 2 spaces; 4th player moves normally + 1 additional move of any one piece he/she owns 3 spaces; 5th player...4 spaces.]

I love the big wooden dragon block. Reminds me of the Ra pawn. This game is simple enough that my 4-year old could grasp the rules. The competition for gold cards vs gambling on getting the jewel bonus is kind of a nice dilemma. Trying to maneuver to get a specific card is tougher with more players. In other words, it becomes more tactical. The variable ending which is in the players' hands is very interesting. I can trigger the game end by allowing the dragon to eat my pawn....which can be a very clever play. I think there is enough going on to make this a very enjoyable light filler, with room for cleverness...but not constantly.

Only one play so far, but I really like it!  Something about this game appeals to me in the same way Cartagena appeals to me -- not exactly sure why.  Definitely looking forward to more plays and to trying it out with more players (we played with 2).  Seems to favor the first person to move -- perhaps this would be mitigated (in a 2p game) if the first person gets to move only one knight on their first play while player 2 gets to move 2?  Will have to try.

RATING: 6
Family games are not my forte because they seldomly offer an interesting challenge to me as a player. But on rare occasions, an author creates a game which breaks this unwritten rule. Rüdiger Dorn did with this game. The movement rules in this game are very simple, and so are the tactics to decide whether to go for gold or gems. But trying to win from equally shrewd players is, for some reason, an entirely different matter. Movement is perfectly calculable, but the group dynamics in the caves are not. You need other players to be reasonably safe from the mother dragon, but staying together also limits what you can grab in terms of cards. It is very unusual (well, I think it's unusual) to see this behaviour in what appears to be a family game.

Some minor quibbles then. The cards are not the most ideal form to cast the gems and money in; cardboard tokens would have been much more pleasant. And the game doesn't scale very well. With 5 players the game is an incredible slaughter; with 4 it's quite challenging for such a simple game. But the fact that I more or less immediately replaced a copy ruined by a glass of cola and an elbow of a careless girlfriend shows that I value having this game in my collection. And that is very high praise for a game of this nature indeed.

Components: Wonderful board artwork that is actually a bit difficult to path at first, but becomes very functional after a few turns. The dragon and knight pawns are good, wooden bits. The art on the cards is simple but attractive.

Experience: In my one two-player outing, this was a game of turn maximization, trying to move two pawns rather than one, trying to get the highest gold or a coveted gem, trying to be first to the treasure layer. It was kind of a crap shoot at first, just rushing my knights through, trying to grab the goods. But the game became increasingly more tactical as fewer spaces still held rewards.

Suprisingly good, albeit light, game about collecting gold/gems in a dragon's cave.  Players advance their nights along a path (the movement mechanic feels like another game I just can't place) into a cave to collect either a gem or a gold card.  Bigger cards await the knights at the end of the track, but the dragon is patrolling to capture knights.  Various bonuses are paid out for majorities and variety.  Very easy to teach - feels like a German game from 10 years ago - not too complex and works very well.

Move your knights a la downfall of pompeii, grabbing gold of gems whenever you land on their space and giving gold up if the dragon lands on top of you. 

The dragon movement track was not very clear, and honestly was a bit superfluous, as the dragon could simply have patrolled back and forth across the whole cave rather than 4 of the 9 spaces.

Nice quick game with very good components. It lacks a little bit in the game, though. Not much action happening and then it is over. Filler in a (big) box.

RATING: 7
Fun enough game. Odd mix of mancala movement, lucky rolls, and elimination. Played once, but I strongly suspect the opening players have an advantage. The mechanism of choosing a gem or a gold card is nice. Emerald could easily be developed into a different, maybe better game.

* Played 10+ times. I recommended this to a friend (even though I'd never played it) since he wanted a game to play with his kids. I'd read good press and the artwork looked great. My only complaint? I didn't get a copy for myself. My loss. This game can be played in about 30 minutes, and for 30 minutes, packs quite a tactical punch for a kids game. In fact, I'll go out on a limb and say it is a good gamer game. Unlike Capt'n Clever which is a fun, simple game for all, Emerald is a fun, tactical game for all with rules simple enough to teach to kids about 10 and up. Recommended family game. Good gamer killer-filler. [o-out (Tikal in)]

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The box says 10+ but I think an 8 year old wouldn't have any trouble, and it is a good family game. Knights move & pickup gold or gems and the dragon tries to catch them. The movement incorporates some medium-lightweight strategy.

The game is very attractive, components nice.

Although we did play this in our gaming group tonight, this is not really a game I will chose for them again--it is one I will bring out with younger family members, and will enjoy playing with them, very much.

Fun with kids or if looking for some light entertainment.  Move rule needs tweaking as the 4th player in a 4 player game tends to be left behind fairly early and has a hard time catching up.

(Played on BSW) An ok game that I'd think was produced for kids until I saw that it was Rudiger Dorn at the controls. Well, ok, it could still be a kid's game. By extension, probably targeted at families, which would make it a natural SdJ entry (it didn't win). It's simple, there's a bit of randomness with the dragon, it plays quickly and there's just enough tactics to keep it interesting for a couple of plays. Nothing really there to keep you coming back tho.

The fairly simple set of rules and short play time make Emerald a nice filler. There's not a lot of strategic thinking involved, but having influence on your opponents' movement and different set collection options add enough depth to make it interesting. And, of course, it has a baby dragon...

This was an immediate hit - we played with 3 (one adult & two young teenagers). The kids wanted to play again immediately.

We learned the game in about 10 minutes by just reading straight through the rules (no one had ever played before).

Dorn manages to impress me again with his simple mechanics and engaging gameplay. When I first got Emerald I thought it was a little more than a kid's game. I was wrong! Dorn balances the few mechanics here extremely well. While luck appeared to have quite a hand here, it really doesn't. Player interaction is also here, as where your partner moves greatly influences what you can do on your own turn. Any luck in here is super fun (that is, watching the dragon take his path of destruction) and the whole "do I do this or that?" feeling is exciting without being frustrating. I give it to Dorn hands down for making such an entertaining, simple game with a theme I love (knights stealing gold and dragons eating knights!)

Good light game, and that dragon coming towards you is never good.  I think my knights wear a cologne that dragons like, since they tend to attract her quite a bit.  Might be too light for some. I've played the game twice now over the years, and while I think it's fine, I'd rather play something like Pompeii or Get a Life if I want a lighter game. This one just isn't very satisfying.

Not a bad little game, actually. Can go really quick if the players are ruthlessly willing to sacrifice their knights without blinking an eye. Too many players are afraid of the dragon, I think, and a reluctant to venture deep into the lair. Making bold moves, however, is what really pays off in the end. The player who won our game went for nothing but gold, gold, gold, only bothering to pick up one gem that I can remember, and then was one of only two players to get a knight to the finish line and thus got a bonus on top of the gold.

Decent family game. I like the fantasy theme and the luck-free movement mechanic. The luck with cards and the dragon is bearable, but it's too easy to inadvertently set up good moves for the next player. Also, there is a clear advantage in coming earlier in turn order, and that is not addressed in any way. On the production side, it has good artwork, but dull wooden pieces are never a good choice for a game themed on knights and a dragon.

Another Dorn game that is very derivative of Mancala, and also similar to Space Walk. There seems to be a bit more strategy here than in Space Walk though. You focus much more on achiveiving your own goals and less on messing other people up. The screw-your-neighbor mechanic is what gives Space Walk more randomness than this one. The theme doesn't really fit here; it's pretty abstract feeling. Nevertheless, I do like the game and probably wouldn't turn down an offer to play.

I realy like this game. My bf hates it cus he lost once cus of the dice. To be honest, he was extremely unlucky that game. Every time the dice was rolled he was busted. So i can understand him a bit.

I still like the game tho. I think its great with any number of people.

This is a great family game, with a balance between luck and skill such that adults are engaged but kids can still win. You're moving knights (pawns) and collecting treasure (cards), but when anyone moves near the dragon, she moves and might eat a knight (unless you give the dragon a gold card), but you've got 5 knights, so no big whoop of a couple of them get eaten, heh :-)

I'm surprised that I like this game as much as I do, since I dislike Mancala and most games that use its mechanic.

Great game, with innovative movement system. The object is to collect value cards, gems, and gold and not get eaten by the roving dragon. Choosing between collecting gems and gold is difficult as you score points for gems but you need gold to save your knight from the dragon. Very easy to learn, and interesting for any age. It's possible with 3 or 4 players it forces a great strategy, with 5 it is too chaotic.

The clear predecessor to Finca. Movement mechanism - check.

It has a bit higher luck factor (the die) that just fits its adventure theme. The game is a bit lighter than Finca but a nice and fun one. And, of course, this is the "original". :)

What an elegant, clever and cool little game. The idea of movement being defined by how many pieces are on your space is great. Thematically I imagine it's the other knights encouraging each other to boldly advance. I like how you can use this to your advantage and to disadvantage the others. While the dragon movement is unpredictable, the range is restricted and the odds are clear which means you have a good chance of dumping a dragon on your colleagues. Fun.

Played 5-10 times. The end may come sooner than you expect, and many knights will not get to do anything at all, which doesn´t seem very fullfilling.

RATING: 7
Simple filler in which players jockey for position while travelling through a dragon's cave and grabbing treasure. The simple mechanics (you move pawns based on the number of pawns on the space they leave) do a lot to make the game highly interactive. The die rolls that control the dragon do a lot to get players involved. The scoring seems slightly imperfect, but this is a game that's more about the experience than the strategy or balance.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
My one play of this with 5 players seemed very random and luck-filled. It also seemed like the players that went later in the turn order were at a big disadvantage. I would play again if requested, but I don't see much here to merit my attention, other than the somewhat interesting movement mechanic. This is a type of game that tends to annoy me, too, in that if played on a light and friendly level, it's all a matter of luck. In order for the game to be a contest of any kind of skill requires every player to be familair with the game and play on a cutthroat level. If just one person plays the game without thought, it sets up others for good scoring opportunities without them having earned them. Too many games suffer from this particular problem, in my opinion.

This game is nothing special, it's utterly simple and with the official rules, it is just a race to pick the most money, and arrive at the end, not caring very much where the dragon is.

I was quite dissatisfied with the game and I was going to sell it, but a friend asked to play a game without being able to bribe the dragon... and the game suddenly improved leaps and bounds! It's still an utterly simple game, but at least there's a lot of tension when moving into the dragon's lair, there are some tactical moves in order to be as few turns as possible in a dangeours position, and it's really difficult to arrive to the finish line.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A nice filler with paste-on fantasy theme. Game is in reality quite abstract but feels good. There is a perfect take-that element with moving the dragon as it is predictable enough but if you put your nose in the wrong place it will be eaten (with help from your opponents).

I quite liked this 30 minute effort. I was expecting something fluffier, but it's got a cool movement mechanism to ponder over on the way to the scoring cave, then there's enough luck in the cave with the card revelations (you take the face up card for the known score, but will you open up a good or bad card to the next player) and then you take your chance that the dragon will smite you to provide groans and cheers. Even then you can sacrifice some points to escape to score yet more next turn. Lag back, or charge ahead. An excellent blend of luck and thought, with nice presentation. Clearly best with 3, which is what we played with, more would be chaotic.

Nice little game by Rüdiger Dorn. There's quite the tricky movement rule, although it's not an original concept, the outcome is quite striking once you played it. Can be very tricky to place the Knights where you want them and every move has to be carefully measured before executed. A very nice family game that can also appeal to gamers. Is great fun with 5 players, but 4 might be the best...

- Easy rules in just about 4 nicely illustrated pages. This game is really easy to explaining and quick to grasp. Thanks to Abacus there!

TRY Sept/04 (BSW): Cute pawns on BSW.  Fun, quick game!  Tough on the person going last, as they are last in the order, and have less movement capability right from the get-go.

OWN Dec/04: Lots of loose bits & cards in the box (could use a better box insert).

Played by the actual movement rules, my wife doesn't like it.  Instead, we roll the dragon dice for movement; eliminates the strategy from the movement, but simplifies it for the kids, giving everyone equal chances at everything.  Nice alternative.

After one play, two player only: got a little bogged down with analysis. Probably a lot more fun with more players, though harder to have any sense of control.

Juego de fantasía medieval (el clásico cacemos todos al dragón malvado y robémosle todos sus tesoros) que en un principio parece destinado a los más jóvenes de la casa, pero que tiene mucha más miga y variables de las que parecen a primera vista. La única pega que le podemos poner es que podrían haber sustituido los peones esos feos de colores y de plasticucho malo por unas miniaturas como Dios manda de caballeros caza-dragones, pero en fín, está bastante bien.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Enjoyable, well-themed "adventure" game where knights move similar to the Sech Tage Rennen mechanic(but without cards),giving play a strategic feel. The moving and collecting of randomised face-up gold/gem cards makes for an interesting and unrepetitive puzzle: as the aim is to amass most points there is afew things to evaluate with such options as collecting the most of a particular gem. I can see such considerations causing some players to slip into analysis paralysis. The dragon movement mechanic and face-down cards adds humour and tension to the mix, which some players may feel contradictory and unfair. Scope for some nastiness but alleviated by the fact that a die roll determines outcome, as does giving the dragon gold to prevent being eaten. Best with 3 players 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Balanced pawn-moving game which allows for tactical play and even a bit of strategy within just a few rules. We play with a variant that the dragon only moves toward the cave when it eats a knight, otherwise she just moves super quickly.

August 2014: Played this many, many times with my 6-year-old niece and nephew. They fully understand the rules, but not all the strategies. They are able to set up the game themselves, except for all the money and gem cards (they have no patience with it). They understand the strategy of trying to be the first to collect gems of all four colours first, although they don't fully understand that the first player has a huge advantage doing so.

Their main strategy is to advance only one knight through the cave because they really want to get to the end and receive a knight card (bonus 5 points). There's none of the clever positioning of your knights -- knights move exactly the number of knights in the starting space.

But finally, a game with some strategy that my niece and nephew can play! It's actually good that they don't fully understand the strategies of this game because players who go last are in a distinct disadvantage.

May 2007: My copy unplayed and unopened. 7-8 year olds enjoy this one, but seem not to fully understand the strategies, which are pretty straightforward.

Não é aquele jogo que nos deixa espantados, mas é agradável o suficiente para se jogar sem esforço e repetir de tempos a tempos. A mecânica convida ao parasitismo, além de que o dragão a degustar os exploradores que lhe chegam perto pode afastar algumas crianças do tema, já que não é uma coisa simpática, como a maior parte dos jogos para toda a família. Dá mais que pensar do que o que parece e tem vários caminhos para a vitória, o que é sempre de louvar… Razoável!

It's one of those games where the main decision is whether you push ahead or mosey along behind, so it needs the control of fewer players to make it satisfying.

Quick playing Mancala-type kids race game by Dorn.

Players move two pawns on their turn. Movement points is determined by the number of pawns on the square that a pawn is departing from. Players try to get to the end of the line whilst picking up gold or gem cards along the way. These are worth VPs at the end of the game.

There is a dragon to contend with...a player who steals gold/gem within a certain distance from the dragon has to roll a die (1,1,2,2,3,3) and if the dragon moves to a spot with a pawn, that player either pays a gold card or sacrifices the pawn.

Great fun for kids, attractive looking components and good decisions to be made.

Overall, good fun, and I enjoy the Mancala movement mechanic. Druidenwalzer employs the same kind of mechanic, but is more of a brain burner. Emerald is the kind of excellent family game that allows parents to cut their kids some slack (if called for) while playing more cut-throat tactics with one another. In Emerald, each player moves her knights through the fields and then into the Emerald's cave; if the knight ends up sharing a space with Emerald, he must pay her a gold bribe or be fed to her hatchling! Players can move one or two knights per turn (and they move exactly as in Mancala), but taking a gold/gem card ends the player's turn even if doing so occurs on the move of the first knight. You see, every time a knight lands in a cave space, that knight must draw a gold OR gem card. If the knight lands in the same space with Emerald, the die is cast and Emerald moves. Wherever Emerald ends up - THAT is where any local knight must either bribe her or become lunch.

This game captures the feel of running the gauntlet, and basically provides much the same game as Mancala but features the option to play with 2-5 and is really just more fun.

This new game is easy to master. The object is to collect value cards, gems, and gold and not get eaten by the roving dragon. Choosing between collecting gems and gold is difficult as you score points for gems but you need gold to save your knight from the dragon. The game board is very colorful and the game for 3 runs about 30 minutes.The rulebook in the box is very good and readable. This game is unique in many ways...........I rate it an EIGHT.

[Abacus 2002 edition] {Fantasy, treasure-hunt, gateway; set-collection, dice-rolling; scalable} Emerald is a decent gateway game - thematic, light, fast, no language barrier, fun and interactive.  It is a tactical game. Even though dice are used, it is not random - decisions are important. Players have nice control on what happens. Decisions are simple yet meaningful. (At least, I usually win :P)

It's a tactical game for 3 players but I prefer playing with more players because it's more fun and exciting.  It's more beneficial to pick up the gold cards; esp. when the value is 3 or more.

The design of components is effective. It's easy to distinguish and separate the cards. The 2 extra cards are silly.  Maybe, I can use these 2 cards to a variant in future. I wish that the dragon was nicer.

The game is fairly dull and seems poorly designed. Still I am keeping it for now since My son really likes it.

RATING: 6
I enjoyed the jewel collection mechanic, decent theme, and dragon movement.  Not very deep, light filler or quick starter.  Other players were not too impressed, but it will probably come out occasionally. I've played several games of this over the years and have, apparently, forgotten to log them!

Really enjoy playing this with our children, not played as an adult game yet, but I can already spot the potential for some strategic dualing!

A fun light filler.  Easy to teach non-gamers, enough going on for real gamers.

This one includes dice throwing as well a bit similar to Verflixxt. In the right mood ok. Nothing more.

Great game. Don't get me wrong, I am a big fan of macho games like Space Hulk, epic games like Twilight Imperium and refined games like Princes Of The Renaissance, but in its own category, Emerald is a gem. The rules are easy to explain and remember, gameplay is intuitive and looks are attractive enough to get people to the table. The most wonderous aspect of the game, however, is that it is great to play with just adults (we more often than not play more than one game in an evening), but also fun with children. Don't be fooled by the "10 " age recommendation - my 5-year old son enjoys this immensely. Be warned, however, that my rating is based on 3-player games only - played it with 5 once, and liked it a lot less because there was little control (would rate it a 6 for that number of players).

Initially disliked this game, but a recent play went some way to changing my mind.  You must avoid setting up a good move for your left neighbour, and there's some skill in doing that.  If you just blast ahead maximising your own score, Emerald is rather dull (but beautiful!)

Fun, quick game.  I think this game has a similar feel as Cartegna but I enjoy Emerald more.

played on brettspielwelt. not really a fan of this one. i don't really know whether there's substance in this game or not. the lack of engagement prevented me from playing enough to find out. i can see how some would like it on a whimsical level though.

RATING: 6
Filler board games are hard to come by, but this is one of the few.  It's a very light game, suggesting that it might be a good game to play with children, but the way the dragon moves and the way that you move based on the cluster of pawns on your particular space require a little more cognitive ability than the game itself suggests.  It's not a bad game, but it's probably a little too simple for adults, and a little too complicated for kids.  I'd like to play it again, though.

RATING: 7
Collect gems/gold before others do with a simple effective moving mechanic which adds to the game. Attractive to look at and quick and easy to play - good for families and non-gamers too.  Not sure if a 7 or an 8, but rated on the basis of being a filler and the fact that the two extra cards are a gem.

A light filler - quick, easy.  This one has really dropped down for me over time.  Given all of the other games available, this one just doesn't have enough going on to hold my interest anymore.

Nice game that plays in under an hour. Quite light, dragon mechanic is cool making the game a little random and create some groans and laughs.

Dragons.  Fun to play with short to medium length.
Easy mechanics with more depth than at first glance.  Several tactics and ways to score.

RATING: 9
This is the kind of game I have been looking for for a long time. Tight, colourful, fast, good components, but the best bit is that it comes in one of those super-skinny non-standard boxes from the 80s/90s.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Had this for a while before playing, and was pleasantly surprised.  It's light, but a satisfying light.  The game itself, the box, the components - all very nice.  Only wish the knight figures were a bit more "knightly."  Another great family game.  Will need to replace our copy since we gave this one away as a gift.  Ordered and on it's way!

Probably the second best family eurogame that I own after Dragonland.

(Counting "actual" board games, not just dexterity/wacky games - although I like those as well.)

RATING: 8.5
Played several times face-to-face and lots of times on BSW (with 3 to 5 players). A clever short game, ideal with 3 or 4 players. There is some randomness (both in the way the cards are placed and in the movement of the dragon), but not that much (and the game is short enough so that it does not bother me much anyway), and the decisions are not always obvious.

Perhaps the best filler I have played, and one of my favourite games of all time. Plays great with 3 and several rounds. Has a little bit of strategy, a little bit of luck, and lots of fun.

Nice, light family game. A bit more complex (strategically) than I thought it would be. Not a lot of long term value for me, as the novelty of several of the game elements wore off quickly.

The game that taught me to beware of positive reviews, as there is ALWAYS someone who will rave about a game.

Boring abstract disguised as a Euro.  The art is so-so, the otherwise-very-nice dragon piece looks like it belongs in a game about Chinese parades, and the play is predictable and uninteresting.

If you don't mind some luck then this one is a great filler. Not as easy as it seems first. You can make some meaningful decisions (including sacrificing your own knights :D ) and I would say the luck is about 30-40% (if you can ever judge this). When played with lots of table talk this is a real gem. It took me some time to actually get this to the table but it was well worth it! Rules can be explained in less then 5 minutes!

Very light, easy to teach, and plays 3 really well. There are better games, more interesting, more thematic, but this will put a smile on your face if you know that it's light and fluffy going in. A good game for a mixed-ages group, so play with the younger ones, too!

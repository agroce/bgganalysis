Based on playtest plays. I've found it quite enjoyable for an abstract, which I'm not normally all that keen on. Plus, the theme - while rather pasted on - does it for me!

Not at all what I expected it to be from the box or even a first skim of the instructions. Not light. Not so much about the card combos - that's a small aspect that provides extra options for the main part. More about the area control/network-building and working out how best to access the high-scoring characters, along with how to work around the traps (rada) that others set up.

Much to admire in this unique game in its look, theme, and weirdness, but the crushing AP, downtime, and randomness that can either defy planning or kill it outright can make it more of a chore than a joy. Took two hours to play with five experienced gamers, and I was constantly unsure of my play and whether I was getting my mojo working according to the rules. I think there's a great game inside this one, but its implementation as is won't let it out.

The most interesting aspect of the game was your chip placement through combining card numbers. Everything else was a loss for me

 While the idea of splashy unique bits is fine, I honestly can't think of any game I have played were they were worth the addition. Let's face it you are paying for a very expensive set of gimmicky VP chips and bits holders (the glasses and monkies). The board had fantastic art, but was a nightmare to navigate.

If ever tasked with having to play it again, I honestly would rather just flip through the cards for the drink recipes. Which is in all honesty the greatest flavor text ever seen in a game.

Actually a great placement game. Fun bits!

Wow this board is busy and I never say that. Love the theme and components but the cards that have 4 little pictures things you need to find in the board is like wheres Waldo x4 for each of those cards and get very annoying. Game gets a +1 rating because I love the art.

RATING: 5.5
A mess of a board combined with a mess of mechanics that confuses complexity with depth. Unintuitive and obscure cards, icons, and gameplay contribute to a weird unhappiness that settles in your soul as you continue to play and are not sure how to make it stop. Plus, to add insult to injury, the box is overly large and has a strange footprint (blame the martini glasses).

RATING: 7.75
This is my kind of area control game. The components are ridiculously good, the mechanics are simple and the player aids are great.  If you aren't playing big band swing or Dean Martin in the background then you aren't doing this right....

Beautiful production. Good mechanisms. Maybe a little too lucky given the game length; drawing a trend that's already complete can easily determine the winner.

This game doubles as a cocktail guide. That alone makes it worth the purchase price, add to it that you get a cute game with nice illustrations that has some depth to the mechanics, and you are looking at a solid game that plays well with most groups. Although beginning gamers might struggle with tracking all the things they have, it isn't overly complicated so a few warnings and freindly reminders will enable them to get into the game just fine.

The game is ok, nothing I need to own. Has the uneven turn possibility which is an auto no buy for me.

RATING: 5
If you get this game, avoid 2-player - very little player interaction. Going to try again 4-player to see if it gets better. I think the yellow "move 2 spaces" cards seem quite a bit OP by just bouncing to and from VP spaces, but maybe that clears up with more players. 

Game took the theme well, but some of the terms were used in multiple ways with no clear distinction. The game terms could have been 1-step more removed from the theme for clarity and it would have lost nothing. Rules are pretty spaghetti too.

Hat tip to the graphic design though - really great looking game.

Fun little area control game. There is a lot going here. Lots of opportunities for clever play. I'd love to play this with 5. Rating could go higher with more exploration.

(10/17) 4. The production on this is OUT OF CONTROL but unfortunately the game is only mediocre at best and the board, while very funny is really difficult to understand for gameplay purposes.

I heard about this game when it was first being discussed on BGG and it got me very excited. Then it took forever to come to KS - and was way too expensive for me when it did. But now it has (sadly) hit the remainders bin and I've picked up a Cpt at a good price. Let's hope it's worth the wait - and the money.

I was the 400th backer on Kickstarter. Love the originality and artwork of this game. I cannot believe that it looks like it won't fully fund. Maybe doing a Kickstarter right after Christmas wasn't the best idea, but damn, if any game deserves funding on Kickstarter, this is it. 

2/4/2015 A little over a day to go and this thing is fully funded. YES!

RATING: 7.5
Well the theme is so cool and really nostalgic for me. I also really love the bits and the graphic design/artwork too. Gameplay seems like it would be pretty quick and offers some interesting choices while still being in a lighter style of game. The Kickstarter doesn't seem to be doing that well unfortunately. It may never make it to production.

RATING: 8
Played once.
Plenty of rules and moving parts to keep across, but it all comes together through the first play.  It's all about the theme, baby, and while you can play it purely as numbers and locations, it's such a better game when you're buying drinks to make the right friends and be the most connected cat in town.

Wow that is a mouthful of a title. It very well describes the game. Simple mechanics under all of the dressing. It is very busy board and some of the objective cards are where's waldo-esque. Cool bits but a bit long for what it offers. I wanted to love it but I just didn't. One and Done.

RATING: 4
Great theme and art. I liked the mathy card-play. But the downtime was terrible. Also, there seemed to be a first player advantage or at least a last player disadvantage. Played once and everyone was ready for it to end half way through.

RATING: 5.3
Provisional rating based on three plays. If this were a quick, smooth playing game, it would be great, but for all the details that went into making it hip, the graphic design *competes* with the gameplay rather than supports or compliments it. Way way too much counting and recounting and searching the board to see if you've earned (or can still use) trend cards.

RATING: 9
I liked the theme and the components already, and then the FruitlessPursuits blogger wrote thst he played two games in a row at Origins and would have kept playing all night if they would have let him, because it is a GOOD game.  It's definitely worth checking out!

Really fun and light Abstract game.  Clever theme which fits the game play.  Love the illustrations on the board.

RATING: 5
What a unique and interesting theme (Voodoo spirits influencing club goers). What lovely components (plastic monkeys and martini glasses). What outstanding art direction (colours, all of them, and very retro). 

Ultimately it's a fairly light, pretty standard area-control/influence game.  There is some nice card-play, you can play cards for their numerical value, adding or subtracting other card values, or play them for their voodoo ability.

Bonus points: Nearly every card in the game is also a drink recipe!

- Requiring you to find divergent characters for the Trends based on artwork alone is unacceptable.

- Long, very puzzle-y turns with no real out of turn interaction makes for huge AP and downtime. This is especially bad with five. Seems like it would be best with 3 but then you have to use a dummy player

- If you don't draw pink cards, you just LOSE.

- It's a hand management game with no way to influence your draws... so frustrating

- Scoring points from trends also gives you new special abilities - rich get richer.

As the publisher, my opinion is biased, but SJVL is definitely a fun game with a theme you probably have not encountered before now. Cheers!

Austin Powers meets Serpent and the Rainbow. Groovy baby. Talk about wild theme. Collect human skulls to cast potent voodoo spells on the lounge lizards that frequent the four different cocktail lounges in order to spiritually influence hip cliques to score cocktail monkeys by throwing a wild spiritually influenced bash. Card driven numbers puzzle for area control. Yah baby.

RATING: 5
Reasonable filler that's really a Rummy variant with a bit of Hearts thrown in (the Ass acts a little bit like the Queen of Spades in Hearts but isn't quite as sneaky and nasty).

I like the variation in the number of cards that are used depending on numbers of players.

It's not a bad game, but I think that there are better ones of its type.  Even so, I'd happily play if it came out at the table.

A decent little lightweight trick-taking/hand management card game.  That genre isn't exactly my favorite, so I can't rate this one too high.  There's nothing particularly offensive or unenjoyable about this game...it just doesn't thrill me.

RATING: 5
{1 play • 4 player} It's okay, I guess, but it resides in a weird middle ground: not heavy enough to be a Game game, but not fluffy enough (or captivating) to be a Filler.  I kinda felt like I was training to play some other game while playing this.  However, it's definitely an improvement over Das Grosse und Das Klein A - though, having played this version I am now SURE that the translation I have (and the one on the Geek) is wrong.  So I kinda wanna try that one again now.

Similar to [i][gameid=929][/i] in that you are trying to get rid of your cards first, except in this one you score points equal to the face value of the cards left in you hand when someone goes out.  Oh, and there's the ass card which, when it is led, means the card-playing for that round is played differently and the "winner" gets the Ass, and the rest of the cards played, added to their hand.  It's light, but not too light, and fun.

I see this in the same vein as Cat 5.  A card game that is a party game as it can play a ton of people.  I like it and looking forward to playing again soon.

Bumped up to a 7.  I played with five and there are a bit of tactics and strategy in the game.  I really like this as a card game and plan on bringing it out more.

The other side of the coin to The Great Dalmuti. Fun group game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A slight improvement on the game otherwise known as "asshole" or "presidents".

Each hand, the current trick leader plays a card or cards from his hand.  He must play either a single card, or a set of cards of the same number.  Players then must follow what is led.  If doubles are led, others must play doubles, for example.  You have to either play a higher card or set than the previous player, or pass.  Once everyone has had a chance to play, the highest card(s) played gets to lead the next trick, and all cards played to the trick are discarded.

The goal is to be the first player to play out of cards.  If you play out of cards you score 0.  Otherwise, you score the value of the cards left in your hand.  Points are bad!

Now, this would be rather boring, but there is an ass card that is always in someone's hand!  When a player has the lead, and also has the ass, he may lead the ass.  All players must then follow by playing a single card.  The highest card must take all of the cards played to that trick into his hand.  The ass is worth 20 points, so you don't want to get stuck with it!

So, in the end, you have some tough decisions.  You want to play out of cards, but to do so, you'll generally need some high cards left in order to be able to play.  However, if you have nothing but high cards and someone plays the ass, chances are you'll get stuck with it.

A nice twist on the trick-taking/ladder game genre.

This game was included as a freebie in a Pozy.com order.  I wasn't too thrilled about it but we gave it a try one day and found the game to be incredibly entertaining, especially since everyone we have introduced it to gets pretty involved.  Though the game plays better with around 6, we have had decent success with it up to 10 so far.  A great, fast-playing party game that most people can pick up pretty easily.

RATING: 5
Components: Very simple design, yet managing to make the numbers look very appealing. Nice linen coating on the cardstock. The cards should be indexed on all four corners, not just two.

Experience: The Ass card, the Jokers, and the removal of some of the cards gives the game just enough newness to distinguish it.

There is some strategy to deliberately winning an ass round early on, to make pairs or triplets out of a hand of low cards; the trouble is getting the lead.

I would play this with a large number of players only, not because it plays better with more, but because there are better trick-taking/climbing games to play with fewer.

Fun climbing game that is pretty light and you can make funny Ass jokes.  I think this one may be better with more than 4 players so that there are more cards from the deck out there.  If you have more than four and you have that itch for something like Gang of Four or Tichu, this might be a good option.  It's definitely the lightest in this genre and would be a fun introduction as well.  Me like.

Amusing variation on *sshole (a.k.a. Great Dalmuti). The hot potato of the "ass card" adds an interesting element and demands the right timing. It's very luck-of-the-draw, though, and the gamers I've played this with have not been impressed.

Disappointing to see Kramer's name on a not-so-fun reworking of an old game.  Players take turns playing sets of cards with the objective of playing all of your cards first.  Any cards left in hand will score you negative points, with the Ass card being worst of all.  When the Ass is led, all players must play a single card, usually playing low so as not to take it.  Pretty much a boring time-waster in my opinion.

There really isn't much to this game. Its vanilla climbing-trick-taking with a donkey card mechanism (whereby the player who wins the donkey card takes the trick into his hand).

[LUP 06-Mar-2007] This has taken over as the lunchtime game of choice when we don't have exactly four players or the when we do have four players but nobody brought the [i]Tichu[/i] deck along.  The more players you add the worse your hands get (i.e. less double, triples etc).  It has no defined end point, so our standard game is just play hands until the end of lunch accumulating the score as we go.  I believe the current record for most points made by an individual in a single hand is 105.

Another in the climbing style of games ala Gang of Four, Great Dalmuti, Frank's Zoo.  It is a bit simplistic, with its only saving grace being the Ass card.

Firstly this gets special recognition and a point for being a rare non-party game which can comfortably entertain 6-8 players, though I've played with 10 which was ok. A less confusing update of Das Grosse und das Kleine A.... and you don't have to look at those pimply bottoms. As with the recent flush of simplified re-issues such as Razzia and Cloud 9, again you can focus more quickly on tactical play and in this case how to utilise the risky donkey card, where as in the original the little "a" is too much of an element to introduce. Incidently, the donkey card is dealt out (rather than played for in the first round) which is fun to see who is targeted. Once I start building a following for this gem, I can start introducing the rule of playing for the tabled Ass card in the first trick rather than dealing it out. Update: the scoring is getting to me and I'm starting to think of simplifing it, such as O pts for the first to go out, 1 pt for the player with the lowest hand score etc; it is just disheartening when you blowout in one hand can really put you out of the running.

The deck includes 110 cards in total with 5 jokers and 1 'Donki'. The player holding Donki can play it as a single card if he leads and then others have to play a single card. Whoever plays the highest card has to take all the cards to their hand. Playes quickly and accomodates upto 12 players. Nice and simpler option to 6 Nimmt!

There's nothing really clever you can do with the cards you're given. A little bit - not much. There's nothing really wrong with that - it just doesn't grab me as being a good way to spend my precious gaming time. Playing styles seem to be very similar between the players - indeed the game seems to play itself. Too much in the hand you're dealt to make this rise above the ordinary.

A VERY light and decent playing climbing trick taking game. Players are dealt from a HUGE deck of cards and are trying to be the first to rid their hand of cards. Tricks are trumped by larger ranked card/sets. To add to the fray is the ASS card. A player who wins a trick can lead with the ass and the highest valued single card has to take the entire trick.

It's lightweight and not as tense or throughtful as Gang of Four (owing to its simplified trick system...no straights of flushes). A plus is that it scales well to 8 or even 10 players!

It's a trick-taking game.  I haven't played a lot of these types of games.  The most similar game that I've played would probably be Gang of Four.  There didn't seem to be anything special about this game.

- maybe too simple
- luck based, but needs some tactics though

Ok rummy style game with a whammy card, the Ass.  Unlike Big Black Mariah in hearts, the owner of the Ass is public information.  I could live without most rummy games, and this is no exception, but I would play this one over most.

It's a light weight, trick taking game that accommodates a whole crowd. It's not a partnership game and you don't have to predict your tricks, just get rid of your cards. The ass card gives it a worthwhile twist; the rounds in which it appears are played more like hearts. Pick it when you've got a big group and socializing is as important as strategy.

OK multiplayer climbing game. I like Frank's Zoo better. But this works pretty well with many players, so it's not something I'd rather not play.

[RGG 2004 edition] {Beer&Pretzels; shedding; optimal 6-8p} It is a fun family card game. It's nasty and fun.  And it becomes more chaotic with more players.  The strategy is not getting the Ass late in a round.

It's only good if the players are dumping the "Ass" fast. If everyone is reckoning the good time to play the Ass and keep it until very late of the game, this game fades and is quite dull.

I quite like the illustration of the cards, which is quite interesting.

Simple card game that has some similarites to the Great Dalmuti.  More fun if people make a point of unloading the "ass" as soon as they can.  If players just hold on to it then the spirit of the game is lost.

Fun climbing game. A bit more interesting than Great Dalmuti, plus no one has to change seats each deal. I like the addition of the Ass card; it adds a new element to this genre. MUCH less going here than Tichu, which I think is the pinnacle of climbing games, but WhA has the advantage of playing with up to 12!

Excellent light and fun card game. Cards are of high quality but I wish the number of each card was written in all 4 corners instead the 2 "top" ones.

I think there are lot of similarities with Great Dalmuthi. Entertaining like it but you do not need to be in 5-7 players to play it, playable in 12 but best with few players.

Fast and Fun.

One six newbie player game behind with slightly incorrect rules. Backward Great Dalmut with random deck (and special Ass card and possible Ass round(s)) is most likely a good description. There is an idea, but the game itself is watered down with the Ass card and randomness in order to appeal casual gamers, I believe.

The random draw of cards based on the number of players, and the weird rules for playing in the "Ass round" (that's what it says in the rules!) make this game a little less than it could be in my eyes.  Still, we played with the minimum number of players, and the dynamics may change with more players.

This game didn't go well at all.  If it is supposed to be like The Great Dalmuti, it is inferior to it.

Este juego no funciono para nada.  Si se supone que es similar al Gran Dalmuti, es inferior a este.

Climbing game without the climbing. Donkey as a penalty that gets passed between players.

It is a get rid of your cards game. Cards are played higher and higher until someone can't play and they take the stack. Similar to lots of climbing games but it does handle 12 players and is fun enough.

Think of it as almost a 'second edition' to Machi Koro. Cards and concepts from the original base game and its expansions, with new artwork that reflects the implied nighttime of the cover art, which I prefer. The setup here is also cleaned up for new players, and I'd say overall that new players should head straight for this Target Exclusive version. Even owning the older stuff, and this not having every single building from the earlier version, I'd still probably pull this out first because I just like the aesthetic a fraction more.

Great game and great improvments over the original. This isn't necessarily an expansion, but more a change in vision and playstyle. It has more cards, more RNG and more flavor than the original. I really enjoyed the original and like this one more. I would only caution that the game playing time should read at least 30-60 as the games I have played with this new version typically last about 45 minutes to an hour. A lot of fun and if you're a fan of the original Machi Koro I would suggest upgrading to this one!

This is really just a minor variation of Machi Koro, but it has some good ideas. Not enough to get if you already have Machi Koro + the Harbor, but if you don't this is a reasonable purchase. Suggest.

Basically Machi Koro built around the variant of having random cards up instead of everything available. It helps make the game much less samey. A good, light game with simple and innovative mechanics. Not one I'd want to play all the time, but solid.

Probably would not have bought this if I knew beforehand it was a "Best of" version of Machi Koro with a slightly different market.  

That's why I get for not doing more research I guess.  Oh well.

RATING: 5
We sold this immediately after we got Valeria: Card Kingdoms. This game is not fixable- it just doesn't play well. Too likely to get screwed by one thing or another, and needs heavy house ruling to make it decent. If you're thinking this, DON'T. get Valeria: Card Kingdoms instead. It's FANTASTIC, plays similarly, and is so good it instantly became a top favorite game. Highly recommend it! I do not recommend any version of Machi Koro.

The cards are poorly worded, and the box is way too big for a card game.  Also takes a lot of table space to play.  I wish the 2 denomination was included.  Still fun to play, a mildly chaotic aggro game in the spirit of Dominion or Splendor.

Love this one!  I like the theme of building a city and the various things  you can do with the different cards. The colour coding is great; makes things easier to keep an eye on how much is owed and to whom.  Also like that there are multiple actions for multiple people with each die roll.  Lots going on without being too complicated.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Components: Fun artwork with lots of little details. Too much text; in particular, it's difficult to read the text on cards in the marketplace sideways and from a distance. At some point during the game I stopped considering buying those cards, because it was too burdensome to constantly familiarize myself with all the options.

Experience: Way too long for what it delivers. It advertises as 30 minutes, but our 3-player game took over 3 hours. At first I thought the game was accelerating, because as we gained cards that diversified our payout options, more cash was flowing into the game. But it slowly became apparent that the more cards we built, the more cards we had to consider with every roll. In particular, as we built the landmarks that allow us to modify our die rolls the game ground to a halt; with every roll we had to survey every player's buildings, figuring out the financial consequences of choosing every permutation of possible outcomes.

In particular, the buildings that redistribute wealth rather than add coins to the system just slow the game down. Not only do we have to ask around to see if anyone can steal or be stolen from, but the same money is just circulating randomly until by chance someone has enough on their turn to build an expensive landmark.

Yuck. I couldn't wait for this to end.

Eh. Machi Koro has a bit of a fun game, but it's just too random. A little too random in terms of the market row (the alternative is worse though), a little too random with the dice effects, and it can go on surprisingly long. Check out Dice City, Colony, or Valeria Card Kingdoms instead.

One of the few games which says 30 minutes on the box and actually means it, this is probably my favourite warm up game and thing to play with new gamers.  This is a card game, not a boardgame, and I wish there was some kind of player boards or shop board just to make it slightly more attractive.  Also, I lament that a card game doesn't include cardboard tuckboxes for storing the cards, but Machi is in no way unique in excluding this. 
Bright Lights, specifically, blends a lot of the best expansions into the base game.  It's hard to say which is better.  The base game might better suit new players as there are less possible cards to buy.  It also lends to more straightforward strategies, which can me more conducive to teaching younger age groups.  Bright Light also adds a fifth player, which is probably the best feature.  And it requires that one builds all six wonders to win, instead of four.  This lengthens the game a bit, rewarding players who have taken the time to purchase the higher value cards and more complex combos and giving them a chance to catch up.  The new, randomized construction pool forces you to use a new strategy every time you play, which is neat (but I kind of prefer using my normal strategy every time).  So yeah, I own both.

Apparently I like this better than the rest of the world (I think I like it better than base Machi Koro, which really doesn't force you to adapt your strategy at all).  It can be a bit random, but it still rewards strategy.  Usually.

Played this a couple of times already with kids, they like it a lot, and I like it a lot more than Monopoly! Although it can start to drag later in the game while saving money to buy the high value structures to win the game. One good/annoying thing is how fortunes can change in a flash -- one lucky/unlucky dice roll could transform you from prince to pauper in one turn, benefiting another player or players.

The original Machi Koro is a fun light game that I enjoy and rate a “7.”  I’ve never played with any of the expansions but I’ve often heard from the people that bring Machi Koro to our gaming meets that the expansions are not very good and after playing with this set I can see a bit of that.  

In this new “Bright Lights, Big City” version, I really like the new changing-market-to-purchase-cards mechanism a lot as it make the game a little different every time you play it, however, some of those new cards that show up seem very unbalanced and make the game far too chaotic.  Towards the end of our game four-player game for example, after my turn finished, Player A would roll something and all my money would disappear, then on Player B’s turn, he would roll something and I suddenly had 22 coins, then on Player C’s turn he rolled something and all my money was gone again.  The other players also went through similar boom and bust periods until someone finally got enough to build that last building during their turn.  As I don’t know all the new cards very well, I trusted that the other players knew what they were doing and disengaged (mentally) from the game at this point and just went along for the ride; this game-play seemed so chaotic and random that the game really plays you.  I think what lowers my rating even more was that with all this chaos, the game lasted WAY longer than any previous (basic) Machi Koro game I ever played mostly because of the random nature of the game/one-minute-you-have-20-coins and the next minute you have zero.  Our game lasted well over an hour which is too long for this kind of chaotic ride.   

I’ve often heard that this is the best version of Machi Koro out there.  I would say that might be true only for die-hard Machi Koro fans and that if you are interested in trying the game for the first time, DO NOT start off with this version but rather try the base game before going deeper into the Machi Koro-universe.

A very simple and light board game that can get those who are newer to board games into the genre. A personal guilty pleasure of mine as dice rolling is the central focus of the game, along with very minor interactions with other players. While panned by others for being too simple and nonstrategic, still a solid game that I am always okay with playing at the table regardless of the group.

I'd call this the definitive edition of Machi Koro.  The new card backs fix most of the gripes I had about the randomized stacks from the expansion sets (although I still prefer having open options the entire game over the limited random stacks).  Some of the expansion cards are present as well giving you a curated set of buildings available.  Completionists should still go for the Deluxe Edition of the original game but for anyone else this makes a good single box purchase to get the best of the sets.  For anyone who owns the original, there's nothing new enough here to justify a purchase.

RATING: 8
This is a longer, more-balanced, Target-exclusive version of Machi Koro that's based on the original plus its expansions. Unlike the original, it allows an extra 5th player.

Machi Koro is on my top 3 list of board games that last 30-60 minutes. It's really fun, easy to learn, and has high replayability.

This Bright Lights, Big City version is a bit more balanced, but it's also more frustrating because it focuses more on stealing from each other. So it suffers from Settlers-syndrome in which you can feel bitter about the other players who are picking on you. Also, despite the label on the box, it's really a 45-90 minute game. Nonetheless, it's still a really solid game.

I definitely would not have bought this if I knew beforehand what is was. We already own the original Machi Koro and all the expansions, so this version was completely unnecessary for us.

The Bright Lights, Big City version of Machi Koro provides only one major rule change by randomizing the way purchasable cards become available to buy (a rule that could be easily implemented in the original game). There's nothing in this version that changes my opinion about the original and its central flaw that the game involves quite a bit of decision making for what ultimately comes down to the luck of the dice determining which cards best pay off. I only keep this game because my significant other enjoys it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
So there are a few new mechanics and rule changes that help clean up. I might have missed it, but it seems that there is no starting money listed in this game unlike its predecessor. That said, if you don't have the original with its expansions, this one is definitely worth picking up. Good gateway game.

Light weight game. Good for newbies. I hate this game. Red cards seem to only serve the purpose of making the game last 9,000,000 hours (they're not actually good, they just make everyone blow all their money every turn.)

I feel that Machi Koro deserves the praise it receives. Very fun game with easy to learn rules. I haven't played it enough to get a sense of flow, but it seems to have a decent amount of strategy to it. I have never played the original, so I don't know how it compares.

Pretty fun, easy little dice-chucking game. I haven't played it versus real board-gamers, so, it's hard to tell how well it plays, but it seems to be okay!
---------------------
Okay, after playing with real gamers, this one has really cooled for me. Basically you're up against the random dice and the random card draw. I like the way this game is built, that it ramps up so quickly near the end and doesn't go on forever. But I will definitely be choosing other fillers over this one.

I will say that this is far better than the original game or "deluxe version"

It flows much better and the game feels more solid.  However, it is still about a game about rolling dice and hope for the best, and yes, the Tuna Boat "strategy" is still king despite the introduction cards that supposedly could stop it.

It's not a game that hurts my soul like Dead of Winter, One Night Revolution, or Secret Hitler, but I think they are far better alternative lightweight games like Sushi Go Party or Formula Motor Racing.

It's just "ok".  Has fun parts but...not as replayable for me as for others.  BUT, this is much better than the plain first release of Machi Koro.  That was broken, plain and simple.  This is fixed and seems balanced and strategic.

All the crappy parts of Catan reduced to a thick sludge.  There's no map game to distract from the dice, and consequently no possible mutualism, which makes this game drag.  

Props to this game for inciting the following:
"Okay, I'll take the tuna boat."
"Hey just so you know I have a house rule where you can only have one of those." Way to go, Machi Koro.

RATING: 6
If you don't already have expansions for Machi Koro, grab this. It is essentially the "Best of" Machi Koro at a discounted rate.

I am not a fan of how the marketplace is randomly generated since it is very easy to miss out on critical buys. That problem is easily solved by sorting all of the buildings and making them available from the beginning of the game (like the original).

Definitely light weight,but a fun way to pass the time with friends who aren't into bigger, meatier board games.

This reminds me a lot of Catan in the sense that you can gain income when it is not your turn.  It is good, but it can get a little samey.

RATING: 3
Rating is not representative of the gameplay, but rather the fact that they didn't clearly state the contents of this edition of the game.

I feel like there should've been clear notifications that this version didn't contain new content for people that had the previous game and expansions.

RATING: 9
Despite negative comments from others about quality and it being a " subpar deluxe version" of the old game, I came across this as a NEW reboot version of an old game, streamlining old versions to improve the overall play. With that perspective, the game plays very well and has my wife and I addicted to playing it anytime we have 30-45 minutes. As for quality, I see zero issues of shoddy workmanship in our copy so no complaints there either.

Saw it on sale at Target so I picked it up.  I'd rather have had the Deluxe edition, but that's $100+ IF you can find a copy, so this was a fine pick at $10.  Actually got my family to play with me.  We didn't finish the game--as usual the game box lied about the game length, but they enjoyed it enough that they said they'd play it again!

RATING: 7
Surprisingly vicious. Can be frustrating for newbies if they get stuck, because 1)Your turns suck because your city sucks, and 2) game takes forever because you can't build monuments. However, I think it's deeper than it gets credit for and there's a lot of fun from watching combos chain together.

Enacts a few small changes to improve game flow from the original, like a guaranteed smattering of buildings in the 1-6 and 7-12 range, and a moon tower to mitigate luck a bit more. A bit more 'even' version of Machi Koro.

Really scratches the same itch as Catan. The dice rolling for certain things to happen is very, very similar to how the resources in Catan work. The nice this for this is that each dice roll feels more valuable than just a single resource and you can mitigate your dice with some of the particular buildings. Even though the trading is absent, which is Catan's best attribute, there are still interaction cards through the red and purple cards.

I also like that the end condition is a little more up and down compared to Catan's set-in-stone victory points. There are cards that can make your win-condition buildings go away, which set you back in return for money. It makes for less runaway victories that I can see.

This game does suffer from the same flaw that Catan has: if you are having bad dice rolls, you are going to have a bad time. We had a guy in my first play experience this. His engine was fine-tuned early. Then he didn't make any money in the end.

Overall, I would say this is animprovement on the Catan formula. Very similar, so if you like the classic, check this out too.

Initial Review: 7.75

The random buildings basically break machi koro as you can't really assemble a strategy. Our game lasted three hours to finish, since the random cards were fairly attack heavy and just moved the money around the table.

Great game. Owners of the original game have downvoted this version because IDW isn't really clear that this is a re-release and update. To be clear - this is an update of Machi Koro Deluxe. It incorporates a lot of house rules and improvements that people had implemented as house rules. If you already have Machi Koro then there's no reason to purchase this game - you can probably just use the updated rules with your old deluxe set. In my experience the playing time is significantly longer that 30 minutes. Last game took over an hour.

This version is a great variant of the base Machi Koro game with some of the expansion cards mixed in with the base game (while some cards were omitted from both).  While I really enjoy this version, I feel the base game is slightly better.

RATING: 8.25
I really believe that this was the best version of Machi Koro, even with it's problems. If you already have Machi Koro and the expansions, I don't think that you need to buy this. However, if you don't already have a copy of Machi Koro or don't have any of the expansions, this may a good alternative to the original or a good alternative to buying both expansions.

RATING: 7.3
Components are mediocre but game play is mostly compelling. It starts slowly but ends up barreling like a locomotive at the finish. I think the game jumps to the end too quickly and starts too slowly. Still I like it enough to play it whenever we are in the mood. A good gateway game for the new gamer.

Played this again last night. Was so frustrated that for the first time ever, I raged quit--and I have played thousands of games over my lifetime. My opponent had a ton of attack cards so almost every time the dice was rolled, no matter if it was her or me, she kept talking my money.  After this kept going on for twenty turns, I could see the writing on the wall and walked away.

Bought this new from Target. Not sure I like this version better than original. By only having five cards available to purchase at each level, there are too many rolls that go without anyone having cards to play with them. Much harder to create card combos. Game is also longer with six landmarks to build.

Definitely takes longer than 30 minutes to play, even with an experienced group. I've only owned this for 2 weeks, but I've played at least 8 times with my kids and co-workers. To me, gameplay feels a lot like Catan, but with simpler rules and less time between turns. Scratches a nice itch for me when I don't have 2-3 hours for a game of Catan :-)

Many have characterized Machi Koro as Dominion crossed with Settlers of Catan.  That's a fair characterization.  Equally fair would be to say it's Splendor with dice.

Okay, but kinda massive - and a little long. We will almost always pick Settlers over Machi Koro, unless time is an issue - and then we are usually going to pick something much quicker.

I almost want to rate this a 6 just because the rules and premise of the game are so well done (not to mention the artwork!). Unfortunately the pacing is entirely off. 30 minutes?! More like 2 hours. The problem is that you are really confined to what other players are doing. If people are only building 1-6, then there is very little incentive to build 7+ because those cards won't proc on opponents turns. And being able to build only 1 landmark/establishment is painful. The red cards make the game super swingy too. Oh you accumulated 15 coins over the course of a couple turns? Well let me and everyone else take all of them away from you now.

Honestly, if the cards were reworked just a little bit, I think this game would be an AWESOME gateway game.

It's okay. The original game + harbor expansion is really all you need IMHO.

RATING: 8
Great game, best with more than 2 players. Easy to learn and teach as someone new to the hobby. The rules do a good job of explaining the more complicated cards.

The end goal of building the landmarks is a bit underwhelming, as you don't get to fully use them all. The box is far too large and the cards move around the oversized insert.

as has become pretty typical with card/engine games: my son loves them, but his goal is always resource acquisition, rather than engine optimization. I think this will be the first one to click for him, since the win-condition is a specific acquisition of eight cards.

RATING: 7.6

I think the appeal of Machi Koro for me, like many games, is the engine building. It's a light, somewhat random game, but it centres around how you mitigate that randomness. Do you spread out and play safe, or try to maximize the efficiency of certain numbers? What combinations of cards are you going to make? Will you buy something to prevent someone else from getting it? And will you save up for the big stuff, with the risk that someone else could steal your money? Machi Koro is a weird mix of a light, silly, take that Monopoly-style game mixed with an engine building strategic euro, and yet I still like it quite a bit. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun little game. I almost wish it was shorter just because there isn't enough strategy to chew on for the length of the game. However, I usually have fun and like the dice rolling. Its definitely easy to pick up and learn and the artwork is fun. Its also so cheap that its worth the price.

Please note: I have not played the original Machi Koro. I have only played this game once, with four players. 

A good game with Catan-style mechanics - without the bartering. Each turn has a Monopoly-style moment of tension when rolling the dice, silently hoping to avoid someone else's numbers.

A good mix of RNG, strategy, and bartering. Leads to an enjoyable game. Upon my first play, it seems that some cards may be a bit imbalanced. However, my opinion may change after several more games. 

Would recommend to everyone. I suspect an 8 year old could pick up the rules fairly easily.

RATING: 3
We played with 5 players and after 1 hour and 45 minutes we called it quits. It seemed like we had another hour or so to go. Everybody had tons of establishments, but very few installations. Watch the dice mechanics as investing heavily in lower number cards will quickly die off. It's either they have no money to give, or they roll 2 dice making it statistically less likely to roll lower numbers. So poor people stay poor and you spent 80% of your time just swapping money back and forth. Then a few cards seem really unbalanced (publisher). If I try it again, it will only be with a 3 person game.

RATING: 7.7
I had wanted Machi Koro for a while, but heard some problems with the game dragging on a bit, especially with expansions. When I heard about this version streamlining the original with its expansions, I decided to grab it. While I never played the original, I haven't had any problems with games dragging on or anything like that. A two person game takes about 25-35 minutes and a four person game takes around an hour.

As for the game itself, it's very fun and fairly light, but leaves room for some strategy as far as what businesses to collect. There is an element of randomness with the dice (determines which cards yield income) and limited cards available to purchase (12 different businesses at a time) but I found that just forces you to adopt different strategies each time you play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Not bad at all, this certainly seems like the version to own. It's pretty light, but that's a good thing every now and then. It plays a bit long sometimes, but I haven't yet found the game boring after 45-60 minutes.  

The components are on the thin side, but it's not much of an issue. I was expecting the worst after reading some comments on the game. Having the artwork set during the night was a good call, everything looks nice.

Also, it's in a box that's four times the size really needed for what you get.

So far this version offers an interesting twist on Machi Koro since you only buy from a small number of visible properties. This keeps people from choosing a strategy beforehand, and it also causes in-game strategic changes. If you already have Machi Koro (especially with one or both expansions), you don't need to buy this. However, it's a fine substitute for Machi Koro if you don't already have the base game. 

Note: You can eliminate a few rules to play this like the original. You can also add these same rules to the base game to play it like Bright Lights.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A nice upgrade to the Machi Koro rules as the separate draw piles for different types of cards keeps the game from stalling out with a bad display.  Unfortunately the component quality seems to have really suffered in this printing... and I'm still not sure how much I enjoy the expansion strategies.  So... while I don't think it makes me want to play Machi Koro any less than I already did... I don't think it makes me want to play it more either...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A fun game that doesn't' scale well, and tends towards degenerate strategies. In our group, first one to the 3 dice minus 1 dice upgrade wins, each time every time. While there may be other strategies that work, the game isn't deep enough for us to really dig into it.

Very beautiful graphics and nice components. Theme suits fine for the game, but playing itself is perhaps a bit too much counting. The mechanics of the game keep you on your toes and guessing for the next turnorder and final points.

Despite the badly written rules, this is a pretty good game.  The board and pieces are beautiful - the latter begging to be painted.  I like the interaction and the repartee that comes with spiking your opponent's points on the market mechanism.  I also like that there are so many things that you can do with cards.  Although there isn't that much that's new here, somehow it feels new...that's getting rarer with Euro style games using the same mechanisms, so that's also a plus.

Utopia is at best a mediocre game with amazing miniatures. In fact, the whole production is outstanding. While the game play is super simple, there is almost no catching up mechanism in the game and the most developed player is constantly gaining on the others. The good part is that the game is short and whether you like the game or not, it's over before you know it.

I like the idea of area control, but the way it plays here, heavily influenced by luck makes it not at the top of its genre.

The game board is quite beautiful and the card illustrations very nice as well.  It is surprising that people struggle to differentiate the Persian and Mayan characters and the Persian and Egyptian buildings.  The prince/princess tokens that are drawn from the bag look nice, but the symbol indicating the island they below to is quite hard to distinguish at any distance.  As for game play, it is an odd mix of area control.  It is easy to think of multiple paths to victory, but it appears that just approaching the game as a VP engine yields the best results.  Getting buildings out early and generating VP (even just 1) every turn appears to yield better results than building wonders.  The secondary scoring mechanisms somehow seem less optimal and therefore may only apply when you cannot build a new building.  The game is good looking and fun to play.  Replayability and game life may be limited though.

RATING: 5
While the concept sounds great, the game is very poorly executed. Highly luck dependent, the game forces players unlucky enough not to get the cards they need to pass and see how luckier fellows can do a lot of things. Not my idea of fun!

UPDATE: Ok, it's not that bad. However, the fact that you don't know the people who will turn in next turn makes planning almost impossible, and it makes you rely on random cards. It's got some thought behind it... it's just that luck seems to play a more significant role.

I'll play once in a while, but I'll not crave to play it often. Up to a 5.

Beautiful artwork, although the counters could have been more distinguishable from each other.  Beneath the chrome is an abstract game.  I was the only one of five who enjoyed my initial game.  The player without the wonder remained in contention - just.  Subsequent play against two newbies allowed me to get two wonders - which proved a losing strategy!  The dynamics clearly change with the number of players.  I enjoyed the tactics.  The ability to ship in princes from neighbouring regions (a useful tactic) reminded me of Thieves of Bagdad.  Rating increased by a point after second play.  Slight concern over the potential point swings available from the change in position of the palace scoring and the potential for last turn Kingmaker situation.

A fairly light area control game which while not very demanding has some interesting player choices to be made. Production quality and bits candy are stunning.

Excellent production quality and great bits.

First Play: Surely a 4 page rule book must be easy to pick up? Wrong. The rules are a lesson in how to be ambiguous and the player aid cards appear to be wrong (arrows for add and remove prince examples are the wrong way around). It took us an hour and a dummy round to get things straight. After that we discovered a clever and strategic game. Certainly the first game has to be sacrificed to get your head around the rules but there is alot going on and I imagine the rating may rise with additional plays.

Jan 2011: Somehow this one never made it back onto the table. Fundamentally a worker placement game, it preceeded many more that did the job so much better and I would much rather play given a choice. Reduced rating and traded on.

RATING: 7
At first glance this game makes any MB Hotel set look laughably underproduced. The French might not have a word for entrepreneur, allegedly, but ambition on steroids is certainly in the dictionary somewhere. A colourful board, great artwork, and beautifully sculpted chunky 3D pieces....  after opening the box, you're probably willing to settle for a game that is only half as good as it looks.

It is also one of those games in which actually playing the game will clarify more about ho it all works, than the rule book will ever do. Expect to hear all the rules being read out, and still not understanding what it is that you need to do. It is far less complicated than it sounds, simple even, but somehow, once the fog lifts, there is also more possible than you will have realized when you sit through the explanation. In the first game, someone's penny will suddenly drop They will execute something nifty with the Action Point cards, and then the communal pennies will drop, resulting in cleverness replication on subsequent turns. It will take a couple of games before people will truly maximise their available options (and quite possibly, before they even start to realize how many different options even a few cards can give you).

It is an fair old mix of familiar mechanisms, and the game itself is mainly driven by 2 that put randomness at the heart of it: the seeding of the arriving guests, which determines what type of civilisation markers players can add and to which district, and the distribution of the action point cards, which restrict a player to executing actions tied to specific civilizations. There are obvious advantages to going first, and handicaps to going last. This advantage is largely due to the players ability to execute all their possible moves in the appropriate phase, rather than do one by one in turn-order. The right cards can let you do pretty powerful things, many times over, and this is compensated for, by giving players different amounts of action point cards. It's a nice variation, and it works well.

There is no direct conflict between players. Any building erected, and majority claimed, will be left unchallenged throughout the game. The interaction is mainly indirect, by messing with the value of buildings, winning the race to the right to erect buildings on empty plots, and by picking and choosing who you will give bonus points to.

Scoring will start slowly, but increase rapidly, turn by turn, when people start to get the buildings onto the board. When players start to breach the first third of the board, don't expect the game to last too long.

Initially I wasn't too sure if it all would work well, or if it would all bog down in good ideas and poor execution. Good design usually takes things out, instead of cramming lots of things in. Not every game that includes seeding, distribution, majority securing, movement, price manipulation, production, sacrifice, bonus points, and hand management, ends up standing upright at the end of the game. But this one did quite well in that aspect. Multiple routes to victory are quite possible, and it will take a few games to determine if they are equally viable as well. After our first game, all players immediately expressed the wish to explore the game more, as everyone felt they had underperformed by not playing turns to maximum effect. Well, for people who usually spot optimum routes pretty fast, that must be a good thing. For now.  

This is one of the games that would improve massively if "overview at a glance" would be a realistic option, but the stupendous production wow-factor, commendably ambitious as it is, unfortunately lets the game's functionality trip up over its own 3D yummieness.

I know that recently wooden cubes and cardboard tiles are becoming a sign of euro years gone by, and game producers have seemingly decided to put the last oil reserves on earth to good use, by adding elaborate plastic play pieces in glorious 3D to their games. As I said, games like this make MB's Hotels look under-produced. 

It all looks fab, but what has been gained in instant wow-factor, has come at a cost to basic functionality, and that should, and could, have easily been avoided.

Saying that, the big complaint, that matching player's faces to building ownership on the board is tricky, might indeed be true for the first phases in the first game, but only if you are truly unfamiliar with your classic civilisations. It also gets much better with familiarisation, even during the first game. I do agree however, that picking more pronounced and iconic building shapes would have helped here. Subtle variations on the square-block-temple theme, although pretty, is too subtle to be really functional. A pyramid for the Egyptians would be a ar more obvious choice, even to the culturally illiterate, and a more "stepped" Mayan building would also have a more instantly distinguishable shape. That would make all 5 buildings very recognizable, without needing a quick tower count to make sure you are dealing with the right building.

However, I personally think the main problem doesn't lie with the playing pieces, but is caused by the board design. The map is as brightly coloured as the players tiles, causing the latter to blend into their background once they are on the board, when you really need them to stand out, as presence, and spread, are vital factors. If they had settled for a map that was more washed out, or that used pastels instead of ultra-saturation, then player's markers would instantly stand out, and [i]that[/i] really would help for that crucial "who is where doing what" assessment.

When it comes to actual game-play, it is a game that pleasantly surprised me, and it plays pretty fast too. The players can make use of their cards in so many ways, that it is rare to get a hand that is really useless, especially if you have set yourself up wisely in the previous turn, and kept some crucial cards back.

There appears to be an important turning point in the game, around the 20-25 VP marker. Up to that point, being last (in a 5 player game at least), is not the end of the world, but after that, it probably is, unless the pack stays close together.

There is enough happening here with enough variations to have made me curious, and certainly triggered the desire to try out different strategies. And that is a good thing.

Addition: further play made me indeed like this game as much as I suspected it would. I like the building-value manipulation a lot. Several games that have come out in that era seemed to want to re-explore that older mechanism again, and this one certainly did it skilfully.
 
It is the type of game where other players behaviour will dramatically influence the actual scoring potential that players have, so it does rely on all players to play competently, and keep actual race leaders in check. All the more in the latter stages of the game, when the points-per-turn will sky rocket.

The visual feast is matched by solid game design. It feels a bit like a conquest game without any actual fighting over the 'conquered' bits. You do need to milk your options for all they are worth, but even a bad hand can, usually, be used creatively if you put your mind to work. Utopia is a welcome and atmospheric visitor to our game table.

Once you get over the difficulties with matching guest-> island -> building there is a very interesting game here. We played with four, I had no Wonder and won by about 5 points, so comments about lack of balance with five are probably misplaced. Nice changes in tempo and priority as you move through the game, with card collection and maximising pieces important early and turn order because of competition for building sites important late.

Fairly abstract.  Too much luck... both in the chit pulls for "welcoming princes" and in the action cards dealt out each round.  Moderate learning curve.  Hard to catch the leaders because they are going earlier in the turn order scheme (most points to least points).  NOTE TO SELF: The beginning is a race to build the Wonders.  So for the start of the game, it's best to try to grab 3 different princes and put them in the "ship" or "harbor" spaces... it's even better if you can choose 2 or 3 different prince chits on the same island.  ** Update: after 2nd play, I really don't like the race to build wonders, but they might not be an absolute necessity since monuments score every round... also I'm annoyed with the great disparity between the islands in terms of number and point value totals for their districts (Fire Island is by far the best and Earth Island is not far behind).  Seems to take longer than 60 minutes to play... and the online interface makes the pace even slower since you cannot see everything at once, and it's tough to tell where some of the bridges go.  The fact that every port district is worth 3 points seems unbalanced.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A lot of great mechanics, but manipulating the units on the board was very costly...  It feels like players all need to sacrifice a little bit of their own best actions to make sure the leader has enough competition...  but in the end it was still a close game, so perhaps that comment isn't truly the case.

Big boxed game with lovely bits - game play is okay, but not so inspiring I want to play it over and over. Main problem with the game is the lovely bits though :( It's really hard to tell the different 'suits' of the princes especially in poor light, and the colours used to differentiate the arrival islands aren't exactly obvious either, furthermore the buildings aren't that distinct either! End result is you have a likely source of irritation rather than a great gaming experience the first few times you play :( Play it enough and you get used to it and then its fine, but the game play isn't so engaging my group won't get to that stage. I think it works better with less players (3 might be the optimum) with 5 you have no control at all going into the last round unless you are in last place, and depending how far last you are it's likely all you'll be doing is kingmaking - not ideal.

** Update, traded my copy - unlikely I'll play it again.

Comprado en pedido conjunto a Ludobay en Octubre de 2016, por 7,5€.
Es un juego sencillo. Hay cuatro islas divididas en distritos (un total de 24). En cada turno hay tres fases: una de llegada de visitantes, otra de desarrollo de la ciudad y otra de puntuación.
En la llegada de visitantes cada jugador va escogiendo la visita más adecuada a sus intereses y le permite colocar un principe en un distrito. En la fase de desarrollo, el jugador puede usar cartas para realizar acciones (mover principes, añadir o quitar principes, o modificar el valor de las edificaciones).
En cualquier momento se pueden construir maravillas o edificios (los componentes están muy bien) y al final, en la fase de puntuación, cada jugador suma puntos.

Es sencillo de jugar y rápido. Válido para no jugones. Las partidas no deben de ser demasiado largas.

Nice plastic bits, but the need to constantly be checking what portrait represents which civilization, and matching that to a building type is a pain.  Painting the buildings might help, I guess.  The game feels like several different mechanisms thrown together without much cohesion.  It's most similar to an action point game in that you have a limited number of cards that you can use to move things around on the board, build buildings, and change the scoring value of buildings.  It's not bad, and I'll play it everyone else wants to, but it's not one that I will suggest.

This game is over produced,  yet for all its neat looking bits it's distracting having to match the civilizations to thier corresponding buildings. The game feels unbalanced. The lead player gets to pick tokens and build first each round. This is a big advantage and there is no mechanism in the game to stop this from happening. Instead, the other players have to attack the leader in order to bring him down.  With little chance for victory the player(s) near the bottom have little else to do in the game but play king maker - with the random draw/ extra turn rule and by using their cards to change the scoring track.

The first play left a favourable impression. The game itself isn't very complex: in fact, it's nothing really more than an area influence game where influence can be moved about in order to optimise the point gathering engine. As such I think it is a clear example of a 'well-polished' title, where nearly everything which can be taken out [i]has[/i] been taken out as part of the design process. Some rules feel a little weird (especially those gouverning the playing sequence), but I expect that as the players' experience grows, so will their eye for this aspect.

If there is anything to gripe about it is the somewhat cumbersome graphical execution which isn't too clear in the case of the players' own markers as the matching buildings are not printed on them; and the lack of strong contrast between those markers and the board. This is a case of artistry winning out over ergonomics, and that is a shame as there really is no need for such a strange victory. To make matters worse the graphics on the action cards is in some cases different [i]yet again[/i], leading me to the conclusion that the French authors really must have been sleeping on the job. As a result, I think that the overall asking price is far too high even if the rest of the game just has this gorgeous and lavish execution—but for the price, you expect nothing short of perfection. If you can get the game at a reduced price, like clean area influence mechanics, and don't mind cobbling a small player aid of your own, then you should check out Utopia. I'm looking forward to attempting this game anew.

[b]Update[/b]   After several more plays, I'm beginning to genuinely like this title. The moving-princes-around part is rule-wise not that difficult, but there's a lot of subtle timing and placement issues at work beneath the pretty exterior. Placing a Wonder must be done quickly for maximum effect, but placing too many hurts your long-term development: buildings represent a more steady source of points per prince. Taking the lead for the entire course of the game hurts your card options, so there is a tendency to hang back a little so that you can sprint beyond 50 points in one go. And of course there are the nasty tricks of manipulating the building value table. No, nice game, so I upped the rating.

Components: Beautiful board; one of the most captivating I've seen. The prince cards also have great art, but are a bit confusing in that they feature a different picture from their respective rulers. That might make sense thematically, but it makes the game more difficult to play.

The monuments and wonders are over-produced; they look cool, but their detail is difficult to see because the pieces are unpainted. It would have been better to have tiles with full-color illustrations; ideally, the illustrations would feature the princes as well, as it's often difficult to tell which prince goes with which monument unless I have in hand a card for that civilization. I appreciate the cool pieces, but I'd prefer them to be more functional.

Experience: 1st Playing (3 players): There's a lot going on in this game, and the rules took some care to explain, but then it was fairly easy to understand and play. I enjoy the prince draft in phase I, and budgeting my prince cards in phase II. There are several interesting ways to score, and clever ways to use one's cards. The change in turn-order based on scoring can be a bit confusing, especially during phase I.

2nd Playing (5 players): Boring. Way too much time in between turns, with nothing much to do. At least one player will be denied a wonder, which doesn't seem fair. We played to half the normal score (25 instead of 50) and this still took two hours. Frustratingly difficult to amass the correct princes in the right place at the right time. The luck of the draw can be damaging too; if I happen to draw the cards that let me quickly add princes and build a monument, great; otherwise, my cards might only be good for torpedoing other players.

All the annoying mechanics from every euro game into one average game which makes simple concepts obscure and difficult to pick up.  A lot of motions are essentially one actio: build monuments baby! Moves are generally obvious and random cards draw really restircts your options. Poor game balance, design, and totally pasted on theme. 
AND I love utopian idea, the cultures, art and arcitecture so they didn't have to do much to win me over.

Are you kidding me?!? Would it have been that hard to pair up the buildings with the corresponding citizens meant to represent their civilization. Comments like "Which building belongs to Featherhead?" and "Is Buckethead from the square building...which one, though?" are common. This problem could have easily been avoided by an icon on the citizen marker or a slot for him on the building itself.

Anyway, after deciding to overlook this flaw and to ignore the strangely written rules and just learn the game by playing it, you will actually discover an interesting game within this giant box filled with beautiful bits. 

There are five different civilizations, which each player holds a number of chits to represent. These chits are placed on different districts of each of four islands. Players swap their representative chits for ones that were drawn randomly from the bag, at the beginning of the round. Players are dealt a hand of five cards, which are used to execute any of a number of different actions on their turn, such as move, spawn, or transport a citizen. Players can also build a Monument, by having three matching citizens in one district, or build a Wonder, by having one of each of the five types on an island. Monuments allow players to spawn citizens for one cards instead of three and to score victory points from other players who use your Monument to do the same. Wonders generate victory points when a Monument is built on the same island. 

It is an interesting mix of game mechanics and I look forward to playing more, although there are plenty of other potentially more interesting games, at the moment.

We played a 5er game, and although I tried, I was not able to get a wonder...as there are only 4 islands (one wonder/island max).  The wonders are valuable, especially on the larger islands, because of the points you get everytime a monument goes up on that island.  That's broken point #1.

But a bigger broken issue is once you get behind in points (not building a wonder sets you back -6 wrt to other players) you play *last* during guest selection and during card play.  That means during guest selection others will take the guests that enable you to get 3 of a kind and build monuments. During card play, they will move to the region and build a monument where you intend to do so.  So effectively you are stuck trying to build in non-port, isolated regions. No one will bother you there because those spots are too inefficient to move guys there.  So you have to get extremely lucky to have the right guest fall into your lap (picking 5th!) or use a lot of cards to get 3 identical princes to a non-port space.  This problem is amplified further if you tried for a wonder and you were the one that "missed".  You now have 4 different tokens all lumped in the same region...which is exactly what you don't want for monument building.  Being last in turn order gets you an extra card. But that's of little value.  The only benefit of being last is changing the scoring value of the monuments.  But really a player in this predicament has very few monuments on the board...so he only plays kingmaker.

Broken point #3...I played kingmaker moving the monuments around to net me a few extra points (since I could not place new monuments).  This move, especially on the last turn, effectively sealed the demise of this game even for the players in contention for the win.

Oh yeah, this is a longer game than advertised with 5 ppl.  It has lots of downtime.

I effectively lost on turn 2 and knew it.  Yet had to watch the obvious unfold for the next 2 hours.

On the plus side, it's got some cool bits.

After one four-player game my impressions are positive overall; the over-production and graphic-overload are minor quibbles.  I like the movement mechanic of the princes, the manipulation of the monumment values, and the "wonders" mechanism.  After my 2nd game I'm impressed with the truism that Utopia demonstrates a triumph of graphics over game play.  The visual cacophony is a bit much.

In spite of the "visual cacophony" this game gets better with every play and has become my area majority game of choice.

Despite the miniatures, an abstract game.

Liked it better than expected.

The buildup is very nice.  The first few turns, things go very slowly, and suddenly everything picks up speed.

The turn order idea (players with more points go first, and get better choices, players with less points go last and take what's left over) is really lame.  Potentially ruining the game.

Potential for AP, may overstay it's welcome.

Lots of cool-looking bits (and a painter's dream), though the board could be a little more clearly built.  After one game it was still not second-nature to remember which building type was associated with which type of token.  The gameplay is interesting, and there are a lot of constrained choices to make, but there's a big element of luck in the cards you draw.  Also, most frustrating is that until the very end of the game, being in last place is crippling, and seems to tend to make the last place player fall further and further behind.  In the last turn or two, strangely, being in last place is actually a strong advantage.

Interesting and original theme, supported by great plastic miniatures (I particularly like the mixed architecture of the wonders). Nothing really new or compelling in the mechanics, but it's still a quite enjoyable family game. With a few adjustments, there might be more for the serious gamer. As it is, the last player has a lot of power to change the value of buildings. But maybe my expectations were just a little too high after "Khronos", from the same designers.

When all players are close to each other and you're getting close to the 50 points (end of the game), then it's the last player who decides the game because he or she can influence the value of the building way too much. If this would have been limited, then the game would be al lot better.

Another example of to each his own.  I approached this game with some trepidation given the early reporting.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I can even imagine this game rising to an 8 with a couple more plays.  It is ridiculously over produced, but it sure is pretty.  The themeing is a bit obtuse a sadly, meaningless, given the quality of components.  A mish-mash of ancient civilizations invited to live in Utopia?  Come on guys, if you are going to do amazing little plastic buildings give us something compelling.  

Anyway, I really enjoyed the rhythm of the game.  It starts of slowly, conflict is too expensive -- then ends with a cresendo of screw with the leader.  There also seem to be a couple of paths to victory.  

Now, I played with 3 players.  I am not confident that the game would play well with 5.  It certainly would add to the down time.  But as I say, I approached this with low expectations, and now think it was a nice release for '07.

RATING: 5
Representing royal ministers to the king of Utopia, players draft guest tokens and play cards to add and move "prince" tokens around the board. Three similar prince tokens in one area can be converted into a monument, which will yield points each turn from there on. Five different prince tokens on the same island can be converted into that island's wonder, which in addition to a one-time VP bonus will yield points every time someone builds monuments on that island.

Utopia was probably my biggest disappointment among the games I tried at Essen 2007, since I had expected to be blown away by it. The components are gorgeous - a bit too gorgeous, probably, since their usability and functionality is sorely lacking. As for the game itself, while it works well enough mechanically, I just didn't find it particularly compelling (and I have a hard time expressing precisely why).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Enjoyable game.
Rules fairly simple once you have the hang of them.
Worried about replayability as there didn't seem like many different strategy avenues to explore.
The phase of the game where the monumnet values could be influenced did not quite work for me.  Seemed pointless for all but the player in last place as anything anybody else did could easily be undone.
As the leader it seems fairly obvious to just diversify your monuments or go for the same ones as the player in last place.  Then you can relax about monument values being altered.

RATING: 8
Good game, excellent bits.  This is a area control game with a twist, that being the building of Monuments/Wonders.  I can understand though why some eurogamers don't rate this one higher and it is because there are two luck factors in the game: 1) The random pull of the "Guest Chits".  2) The random draw of cards in the "Action Phase".  This factors don't bother me a bit, I like the game.  To me seems that it would scale well with the number of players also.

Great components and very interesting mechanics. However, after one play, it didn't quite click for me as much as I would've thought. Perhaps my group was playing suboptimally, but there wasn't as much interaction as I would've guessed. And despite the fact that you have a ton of options on your turn, there still seemed to be an overall feeling that the game was primarily decided on the luck of the cards. (I know - that's what the favors are for.) Still, it's an interesting game that I would like to try again.

One of the best looking games to come out in a long time, and guess what? It's fun to play as well! Plenty of choices to make and good player interaction. Has a certain rhythm to the turns that keep the pace going. Almost hate to put it away at the end of the game -- looks pretty amazing all built up. Looking forward to playing this more.

There are definitely some subtle stratagies, but often it seemed like the luck of the tile or card draw was driving the game. The buildings are so darn cool looking. I just wish it were a deeper game. You try to get three people from the same civalization on a space to put up a monument. If you get one character from each of the five civilizations onto an island you can put up a wonder which immediately gives points. Monuments score at the end of each round based on a value track that can be affected by cards you play. The game starts out slow, but once a few monuments are built the points accumulate quickly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Surprisingly little interaction in this city building game.  Players bring on pieces in various civilizations in an attempt to get stacks of 3 for scoring opportunities.  Mostly it's a hand management game, and plays somewhat by rote.  More "solving the puzzle" than strategy.

Much lighter than it appears, and (I hate to say this) a little overproduced and busy.

Initial impression.  We played with 5 players, and the game has four wonders to build.  The player who didn't build a wonder lagged far behind; although he did tie for 4th by the end of te game.  Great bits!  Makes me want to play an ancient version of Big City with the plastic buildings.  The game is worthy of more exploration.  And I would play again.  But I'm unclear when the next opportunity will appear.  The game has a feature, which I believe we under utilized, that allows players to draw a blind tile if they give a free tile to another player.  Towards the end of our game the 4th and 5th place players did this to help each other; giving them 5 tiles in that round compared to 3 tiles each for the rest of us.  While this catch-up mechanism is kinda neat, it also scares me.  It would be possible for some coalition of players to agree to help each other exclusively.  I wouldn't expect this sort of behavior at a home gaming event - but worry this could show up at a convention.

Meh. Components are cool, but not practical, as it's hard to tell buildings appart. The box is also huge, which makes storing it a problem. These flaws would be forgiveable if the mechanisms behind were more interesting, but it's a rather typical game of area control. There are many games out there which scratch the same itch, and do it better.

Good tactical area control game with excellent gaming material focussed on five of the great civilisations. The victory points for the different types of monuments are variable (by user manipulation), which adds an interesting element. An early wonder can generate a lot of victory points! Last player in the last round might become kingmaker, so watch and time your actions carefully. Overall, the element of luck in the cards and tokens is maybe a bit too high.

A very straight-forward game with only two different strategies to win. All the rest is just overproduced components and other stuff.

While there were some interesting things going on in this game, I found it rather monotonous and unexciting and just wanted it to be over.  The aspect of scoring monuments according to the prestige scale is interesting, but the ability to play two cards to dump a civ priv down to the bottom is just too powerful and gives a lot of power to the people who are behind (particularly if they're not really understanding the game or paying attention to what the leader has that is scoring him/her tons of points).  Other frustrating aspects was that if I wanted to bring the leader's civ value down, I had to have the right cards which were always luck of the draw.  Graphics were horrendous, the ships on the board should have had better markings so it was easier to figure out where the guest markers should go, and there were other issues that made me just prefer other games over this one.  This one will be leaving my collection.

While not as annoying as either of those two (yet), It is definitely not a buy for me. If I were to rate, I would probably put it around a 5, with potential to move a point either way.

RATING: 6
First impression (5 players): The fifth player was too much. The game would be better with just three. Also there is pretty much of chaos. The biggest annoyance in this area is the way you can make value of one temple type to drop from 5 to 1. As there aren't too many temples in any case this is usually very big swing in points and if you're early in turn order there is nothing you can do about it. It felt that the price for doing this (2 cards) is just not high enough. My personal solution (the best one I could figure without messing too much with game dynamics) would be to rise the price of this move to 2+1 cards, two as in basic game and then third of _any_ type. This makes the move possibly expensive enough not to be used too easily.

Second game with 4 players was a better experience but same problems were there and one of the biggest is the king making on the last turn(s).

RATING: 6
Confusing components and obscure rules make this a game that is hard to get your head around. When playing with 5 players there is very little control over monument score values as the last player can significantly adjust the value. You need to be at the back of a tight bunch of players on the last turn and come from behind to win.

This game lasts sadly to long and is not very clearly arranged. The board is to colorfull and the monuments and palasts are to similar. We had a hard time recognizing the various chits and bits. The game itself is not very difficult but also not to much exciting! An ok game!

If you wanna play this game, you'll have to except, that there will be some luck involved, as well in the tokens getting out the bag, as in the cards you get. Personally however I could live with the balance luck/strategy in this game, it's about the same level as in a typical HiG-game.

What however didn't feels so 'right' in this game, is the determination of the palyer order: the player who already has the most points, will get first pick on tokens, as well on playing cards. OK, he will lose 2 cards, which can be 'ouch', especially if you're low in cards, but still that doesn't seems to compensate on being first in both phases.

Interesting game.  Possibly a bit of a runaway leader problem, but I don't have sufficient plays to properly assess that yet.  Still, it is a fun, light-medium euro.  On further consideration (without having played this again), this may be a medium weight euro that really only shines when all players fully understand the game and how to properly impose checks and balances on other players.

There's a lot more going on in this game than originally meets the eye. Do I build wonders early on or do I get a head-start on the monuments so I have something to work with later?
This game got better and better the longer we played. I took an early lead but was shot down pretty fast in the late game scoring. Being first player is nice but discarding cards can be painful.
One problem I had with Utopia was how hard it can be to keep track of all the little tokens. I wish it were easier to distinguish different princes from each other.
Overall: I enjoyed this game enough to want to pimp it out and paint the buildings. Which is saying a lot, considering how big of a project that is.

  Very clever game play.  Pretty fast moving.  The Wonders paint-up 'wonderfully' and mine are all hand-painted.   One House Rule: the odd, game-slowing SURPRISE GUEST rule: Only allow it for the LAST pick of the Arrival of Princes (when only 1 Prince remains)... that player can either take the last prince on the board or reach into bag and select One random prince which must be played.  Cut the silly additional selection of another player as that phase is now over. 
   It's not a perfect game, but gets better each play.

I've played many worse games - in my one play of this, it seemed to work OK, and not be quite like any other game I could name. And yet, there was nothing different enough to make it stand out from the enormous throng of Euro-style games. So this game, while perfectly competent, is in my opinion not really worth owning, and rarely worth playing. Despite the enormous "big box" style presentation.

Nice plastic monuments and wonders, but everyone agreed that they should have been molded in five slightly different shades of plastic to make distinguishing them a little easier.  In fact, the borders between districts and the art on the counters could have been done a bit better insofar as they could have been easier to read at a glance.  Still, a pretty game.  There's a fair amount of luck here (which visiting princes show up this turn, which cards you draw) and it is, largely, a bad thing to get behind, since you will act last in every case.  I think I'd change the cardplay phase to require one action at a time, in turn order, until everyone passes, rather than the current "first players does all actions he wishes then passes" scheme.  Would certainly try again.

Better upon reflection than during play.  The over-elaborate design was nice but the detail was too subtle to make locating tiles easy once they were placed.  
There clearly weren't different paths to victory - the question is more whether you get the timing and location right so that others use your facilities (wonders and monuments) more than anyone else's.  But that timing stuff was interesting.
It appears to be a nicely balanced game, with plenty of "hit the leader" systems that allow a backmarker to make an unexpected catch-up, and the stock market element of the monument values is nice.

RATING: 6.5
The board artwork is very nice but the counter artwork clashes awfully. The board looks very messy during play and it is diffuclt to see the pieces. For this reason it reduced my interest and enjoyment. 
The game itself works fine but it seems 5 players may be broken as it is important to get a monument and only 4 are available.
The theme is so ridiculous - surely there could have been something better? Despite this, the plastic buildings are very nice components.

RATING: 8.5
A seriously underappreciated game.  Yes, there is some luck, but this game is FUN.  I put it in the same fun class as Thebes (although more of a brain burner).  I don't think this game is overproduced at all (the neat civ buildings only enhance the experience), nor do I find its graphics confusing.  Utopia is expensive, certainly, but well worth it.  Granted, it is a majorities, drafting, and hand-management game, but one with several engaging twists that kept me interested from beginning to end.  It's one of the few games I've played recently that I immediately wanted to revisit (the others were In the Year of the Dragon and 1960: The Making of the President.)  And the little city that you build during the course of Utopia reminds me of that one in Star Wars I (you know what I'm talking about?  ... the one with the cool domes and waterfalls.)  Anyway, with Khronos and now Utopia, the designers Vialla and Urbon have definitely attracted my attention.  A team to watch.  Maybe they are the next Kramer and Kiesling?  I hope so !  (Don't pass on this game because of graphics whiners.)

RATING: 6
The game was ok, kind of on the San Marco level, but it was hard to tell.

This is because the entire game is spent placing pieces and trading them for their corresponding buildings, but there was no player aid or guide as to what person corresponds to what building! You had to have the right card from the deck in your hand, and even then it was confusing, because some of the buildings and people looked almost the same.

Add to that bad colorings like purple and a slightly darker purple, and a busy board with colors the same as your tiny people (so you can't see them), and you have a disaster. Just a player aid for the people/building problem would do wonders and I would overlook the other color problems.

We quit in frustration.

Very unsatisfying game. Looks pretty until you cannot find anything on the board. Half the time you have no idea what move to make. Winner is determined by who every gets a monument first. They then accelerate to the 50 points needed to win.

RATING: 4
Surely Matagot tried to make up for the lack of substance with flashy bits. Even then, they screwed it up. The bits look too similar to each other and is confusing for players. Players are placing advisors (resources) from 6 races in order to build temples (factories to spit out more advisors or to sacrifice advisors for VPs) and trying to score point from building as well as a ‘stock market’ which awards Vps based on the value of the different temples. The movement system needs work (a poor placement will be too costly to overcome by moving)

Cards are used to move, produce and sacrifice advisors, manipulate the ‘stock market’.The game ends when a player gets to 50 VPS. Expect plenty of frustration as movement is severely limited, king making abounds (there is too much of a spread between the low and high value in the stock market) and the is too randomness of card distribution and board seeding. It almost feels like too much work for very little payoff.

Excellent area-control game.  You try to collect similar visitors in the same district to score you points.  The best part of this game is that you can mix up the value of the monuments to dramatically alter the scoring.  Deciding between improving your standing while dragging down others makes for a quite enjoyable game, indeed.   Might be a touch high, but for now, it is a very fun one.

UPDATE: Dropping to an 7.5, as it's not amazing, but still a fun play.

The components are pretty, but it is a case where the components get in the way.  It is very frustrating to continually map Buildings to People to the Position on the score board.

Online (jsp-mag.com) play only: the interface isn't pretty -- I think it actually makes the game go slower!

Basically this is an area-influence game, with some mechanisms similar to Thief of Baghdad (and similar room for clever card play to move your princes around the board). Turn order is based on scores (higher goes earlier), with potentially significant advantages going last (especially on the last turn of the game). So, as in Power Grid, it's nice if you can stay in back long enough to take advantage (you also keep an extra card each turn) then jump to the lead on the final turn. But if you can't take the lead, you end up being kingmaker ... which is kind of annoying! Other annoying things: the bits are pretty, but appear to be too similar to one another! You need to be able to differentiate them quickly, and you just can't do it!

I hope/suspect I'd bump the rating up a bit after playing on the real board.

An average area control game. The bits - the wonders and monuments - are beautiful, but the graphics are poor, and people inevitably seem to have trouble distinguishing between the the different civilizations and which monument they're represented by, and the connections between districts. For all that the bits are beautiful, Utopica still doesn't exude much theme for me, and the game doesn't seem to move along quickly enough to me to stay interested. I expected a little more from Utopica given the fairly favorable ratings here on the 'Geek.

Played once with 3 players. Very interesting game that takes a play or two to figure out a good strategy. I know now that for 3 players, only 3 islands will be built on so going for 2 wonders is a very bad idea and a waste of tokens. Need to try with 4 or 5 as that is probably the best number.

The production design of Utopia is so darn confusing that it effectively ruins the game.  If I played it a few more times, I'd end up airbrushing the pieces.

It looks just beautiful BUT it's hard at 23:00 to see all tiles on the board since they share colors with the islands shown. Not a brilliant design though but still fun to play.

Beautiful bits. You may laugh but it reminds me of Elfenland. You spend the first part of each round placing your pieces on the board. Next you play as many cards as you want to arrange your pieces to your benefit. The difference is that you place your pieces before you draw more cards. Sometimes the cards don't fit with the pieces you choose to play. You do get 2 change card tokens. They are a big help.

Played it on the iPhone a few times, but one face-to-face play.

Good stuff.  Donkeys are good and bad.  Nice balancing act.  Will play more.

Update: Upgraded to 7.  Good fun for 3 players.  Too bad the blue/purple are hard-ish for me to see.

Another combinatorial card game where you have to find a good play so that it's the next player not you that gets screwed. Can't figure out strategy though there's probably at least a little.

Colours are a bit awkward to distinguish (the suit of a card is shown only by the colour of the corner numerals.  Like Schotten-Totten, but you'd think they'd have learned by now.)

Quite interesting set collection game, very typical from Michael Schacht.  It is interesting that it is specifically for 2-3 players.  As usual, sometimes you need to take the bad cards to try to get better options later.  If only the other players let you do it...

RATING: 6
Clever little card game where the tension is to get the lowest card on the table or get a card you want more but your hand size decreases.

An interesting twist is that when you claim sets you want your handsize to be small so that you can steal a card from the opponent.

Juego de cartas sencillo y portable, que funciona bien con dos o tres, y que recuerda a los juegos clásicos de cartas. Mucho puteo, que lo hace más divertido, y con más miga de lo que parece (sin dejar de ser facilito).  La principal pega es que en ocasiones se nota bastante el azar (aunque también hay que buscarlo) y que se hace un pelín frío y repetitivo cuando se le coge el truco.

This game is very fun and fast - similar yet different from Jaipur regarding the camels. :)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very interesting little game, for 2 or 3 players. The rules are missing the crucial word OR, meaning you either take the lowest value card or you swap cards, not take a card and then swap.

It's interesting that it works for two or three players. It plays out very well, with players being able to suss out the opponent's best choice and so plan ahead a little. The colour scoring at the end is a clever design too. It all works out very nicely.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
It might be better with 3 players, as with 2 I found the choices pretty dull. Try making a set first, no matter how low its score, to steal big cards from your opponent in order not to let him collect those in his sets. 5/10 with 2 players and I can see it getting 7/10 with 3, but how often will we play with that amount of players ?

I was throwing together an order and threw this in on a whim. I am glad I did, since this is a nice 2 or 3 player option. Plays quickly, pretty easy to explain and it is just engaging enough to be interesting. Also, how can you not like the donkey illustrations?

It is always a good sign when people ask to play again.

RATING: 6
This is an odd filler card game. Only feasible for two or three players, the feeling of getting played in the first turns. Then it clicked and we discovered a mean little game that's ok for gamers as well. It's about timing the completion of sets right to steal a valuable card from an opponent while not leaving them opportunities to retaliate as well as trying to be the one who can choose first once the open cards get replenished. A bit too luck-driven for a higher rating but enough influence to be worth playing.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Fun enough little card game filler that doesn't do much to stand out of the crowd. I'd happily play again, but it isn't anything I need to own or play regularly. There is some stealing of cards from other people for those who don't enjoy that sort of thing.

A great filler game from Michael Schadt that recalls the classic Coloretto,  but also Jaipur. Many nice decision points in a game that's rules-light. The game involves set collection from a shared pool of cards, stealing from one another, and clever use of donkey cards. What more could you want? Oddly, there was an IOS app released in the USA, but the game itself never came here.

Works only with 2-3 players.

RATING: 6.8
Pros:
- Plays so well with 2, it might surprise you it can handle 3.
- Small/portable. Just 60 cards (or 54 for 2 players).
- Quick setup. I put the Donkey cards in larger sleeves to make them easy to keep separate.
- Only three possible actions - Take a card, Exchange for lower, Exchange using Donkey - but the choices feel meaningful.
- The right level of randomness and luck to keep things fresh, but not so much to make you feel out of control.
- No hidden information. No cards in your hand and you always draw from face up cards.
- High level of interaction with a good bit of "take that".

Cons:
- End game scoring is a tiny bit tedious. You'll probably average about 25 cards you'll need to add up, but you can keep a running tally or make piles of 10's while you're waiting for your turn.
- It is possible for AP to set in.

Unsure:
- The endgame, after the draw deck runs out, feels like a completely different game with very different decisions.


= 2013-04-20 - R:6.8

One play so far, but I really liked it. It felt a bit like a combination of Traders of Carthage and Jaipur, which is pretty high praise. Plays perfectly with 2; I'm anxious to try it with 3.

Great game. Starting at 6.8 but if it can go multiple plays without feeling the same every time, it's probably going to go way up.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.75
Only for 2 or 3 players, but a really good card game.

Collect sets of three to bank, minuses aren't always bad (if they help you complete an otherwise high scoring set), use donkeys at the best times.

When you score a set you can take a card (of a colour you don't currently have) from another player.

All open-display so you can see what your opponents are collecting & make sur eyou don;t give them an easy set!

A simple and clunky 2-3 player game which mostly plays itself as decisions are very obvious. No theme, not much to see here. Wish I could say more about it, but that's really it.

Nagyon egyedi játék. 6 színben gyűjtünk lapokat, amik többsége pozitív és van néhány -2 érték csacsival jelölt lap minden színben. Az öt kirakott lap közül vagy a legkisebbet vehetjük el vagy a -2-es értékű lapot beadva bármilyen pozitív értékűt. Hármasokat gyártunk színenként, majd ezeket gyűjtjük. A játék számomra meglepő módon 3-an is játszható, amikor elrakunk egy hármast elvehetünk egy ellenfelünktől egy kártyát, emiatt hárman simán királycsinálás lehet. Szerintem ez egy kettes játék, úgy teljesen rendben levőnek gondolom.

[2015-11-26]
Második játékra, bár az elsőnél a pontozást hibásan játszottuk ki merem jelenteni, hogy ez egy kettes játék. Hárman nagyon sokat számít kitől veszünk el, az utolsó kör pedig kiemelten nagy jelentőségű. Ketten viszont nagyon jó lehet.

RATING: 7.5
This game is so simple that it is rather shocking to see that it actually works as a game.  On top of that, it is surprising that it took 'til 2011 for someone to put it out.  It is a set collection drafting game, and really there isn't much of a twist to it, but with the margins as low as they are, the variability of the draws and the potential for setting people up to take negative scoring, the design is persistently engaging, despite wanting to dismiss it for its elementariness.

Played the iPad/iPhone version. It is a light filler and not all that different from Knizia's Money. Swapping cards to collect sets and such. I find it entertaining but not sure how this would go in a person-to-person session because it is a little too light for my taste. 
102112: The actual card game plays a lot slower and certainly more thought provoking. One strategy I noticed is to force set completion for opponents by swapping around donkeys at the end of each round such that opponents are forced to complete the set with donkeys. With slower game play, more strategies are revealed making this a deeper game play than at first blush

There's an elegance to this game, thanks to its simplicity of design.  The rules are fairly simple and straightforward, but the tactics you use in this game remind me of Crazy Chicken, in that there's a very subtle way that players have to manage their hands.  The idea is simple enough -- take a card, score when you make a set of three in a color, and steal a card from your opponent in a color you don't have when you score -- and while the choices aren't always agonizing, they're tricky enough to be satisfying.  I played this on my iTouch, which convinced me to buy a physical copy.  With a little time, I can see this moving up to the same level as Crazy Chicken.

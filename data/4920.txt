I felt submarines were under powered in the "Fleet" series but I really liked the activation system in this series.

RATING: 10
Probably an "8", bumped up to a "10" by nostalgia.
BTW, the game's title anticipated the reconstitution of 5th Fleet. Pretty cool!

Indian nuke subs
Rented from the Soviets

I think I underestimated this game in the past.  I have always enjoyed 7th and 2nd Fleet, but 5th did not register highly with me until recently.  Maybe having learned more about Asia has had an impact on my opinions about this area of the world.  At any rate, I do think this is an excellent game but, as I have stated elswhere before when it comes to the Fleet series, 6th is always the best to me and 3rd the worst with 2nd, 7th, and 5th fluctuating places in between.

I haven't played this game in a long time.  I bought it because I liked how the air support was set up.  I used to play it daily on the computer PBEM version.

Another installment of the classic series. The massive map gives you both the restricted waters of the Gulf, and the massive Indian Ocean all the way down to the crucial Malacca Strait. All the elements are here, with simple-but-clever subsystems working to produce a tightly crafted game of planning and resource management, with critical die rolls making evey phase a potential nail-biter.

I always thought this was the best of the Fleet Series.  That may be because it was the first one I learnt.  However, I think it is because of the scenarios and the vastness of the Indian Ocean.

Relatively low counter density combined with fairly elegant core rules. There are several types of combat, but you learn the intricacies quickly and on the fly, but there are some chromy elements such as detection that have a lot of subcases. That said, a very quick playing and fun game if you have the space to get all three maps down.

Have only played using the basic rules, but it's a ton of fun.  Covers a lot of ground without too much complexity.

The only downsides of this series are that the rules changed slightly from game to game, and some of the scenarios aren't very balanced.

Prescient in shifting focus to the waters of Central Asia ... locale is right, but non-US combatants seem improbable in the 2000s.  But as we all know things change.  Let's face it the USA's enemies these days do not have fleets of CVs, CGs, SSN, etc. Still the Fleet series as a whole was very enjoyable.

Again - a great game, but this whole series is a bit too much for my tastes today. If it weren&#039;t for all the rules, I would love it.

Mr.Balkovsky created a top hit with the fleet series, this one being the one with more balanced assets for the soviets.

The Fleet Series is a lot of fun as a simple challenge between two players, as NATO tries to impose their superiority over the WARSAW Pact. Series does not include many intelligence gathering methods of the period. The Map and counters are superb, and the game is rather easy to learn with well written rules.

Victory Game's modern fleet series. Perceivably a complex air-sea joint operations simulation, at the core of the game is really a simple operations-driven system. The game focuses on the world stage hotspot where potential conflict might have erupted into full-scale war between Soviets and the US and his NATO allies. All the battleships, cruisers, destroyers ,submarines, aircraft carriers are all included in accordance with the historical fleet designation, not to mention the dozen types of all the modern air fighters. Different types of sea-air operations are simulated with various scenarios and scenario lengths. The fleet series games introduce many modern military doctrines and concepts like Combat Air Partorl (CAP), area sea search, aircraft readiness, the strengthened role of aircraft carriers as distinguished from naval assets and the joint operation between navy and air forces. Combined arms concept move from between different land forces (tank & infantry & artillery) to air and naval forces (bomber & fighter & battleship). A much more effective regional war effort is amplified by the modern war machine capabilities.  5th Fleet covers the hotspot of Middle East.  An excellent game and an interesting interactive designs. You can have a lot of food for thoughts while playing this game.

RATING: 6
My foray into the fleet games. Has a pronounced 'chessy' feel to it. Huge amounts of information in the game, and some well thought out and implemented scenarios. I find play frustrating, with the sequencing of the turn a hindrance for integrated operations, rather than a help.

Also, the structuring of the air counters means that the application of airpower is much too granular: You can't divide a squadron between several missions. Its all or nothing, which I find unreasonable. (it means that you need ALL 12 Tomcats out looking for that snooping Bear in the next sea zone, leaving nothing for strike escort or a decent CAP) 

I considered using 5th Fleet as a scenario generator for Harpoon, and playing one of the big campaigns in  that format. Would have been a monster, though.

As with several other AH and VG games, great variants that fixes many of the problems, can be found in The General. 

For the fleet games, do not play without the variant rules in The General vol 27 #2: "The problem of sequence" by Thomas Dworschak (the subtitle is "interactive third fleet", but it works with all instalments of the series, borrowing the initiative system from Korean War, also AH) - which makes it play a lot more like Desert Strike (and if modded to allow more flexible airpower allocation, it could be really really good!)

Other tinkerings I had worked on was a way of splitting up all the factors for aircraft into values for single aircraft and a more finely detailed damage allocation (losing components instead the of much simpler, but somewhat arbitrary-seeming above half of damage, flip), but that borders on venturing into Fleet: The Spreadsheet-terroritory

Soviets never could breakthrough the CAP of a CV battle group. Realistic, maybe, but as a game, hard on the Soviet player. Colorful though to see all the different navies. Rules are well done with good examples, clear writing style, and good scenarios.

Fun, varied and exotic thanks to all of the minor nations, but the campaign scenarios are truncated with no reinforcements; as a result the battles burn down quickly.  The only member of the Fleet series that leaves me thinking, 'eh, could have been better. . .'

The systems gets better and the area is interesting. Many small fleet and small conbats can allow good scenarios.Nevertheless soviet OOB is quite enormous (most of the ships are already in other games). 
Subs gets a better treatment and can be hunter and not only game like in Sixth Fleet.

Benefits are that the tiles can be flipped over for the exploration aspect I like, also it doesn't use up much space and can be easily carried. But the pieces are so tiny that it detracts from the play. Would consider selling/trading.

No boats or knights.  The pieces are quite small, so they could probably be easy to lose on a plane or train.

However, it was good to introduce our 5 year old to the game.  It can handle substantial table shaking.

It is a bit convinient, being able to take Catan almost anywhere.  But I'm not a big fan of how the numbers are already assigned around the island and the desert tile is always in the center.  Also the slightly modified placement of the trading tiles is a little bothersome.

Not a substitute for the real deal, but the travel edition of Settlers is great for both playing on the road, and for squeezing in a game when you don't have the time to set up the regular edition.
Improvements could be made (a peg track to keep track of resources; a Trouble-style dice popper thingy), but overall this is a very worthwhile product.

RATING: 8
This is just Settlers with holes and pegs to keep stuff from moving around while you are driving/flying.  It does have a preset board setup, but that's not a big deal.  It's a trade-off for being able to play while traveling.  It also has tiny, tiny cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Man, the pieces and cards for this are TINY. And the box insert doesn't hold things in if the box gets shaken up (if it were in luggage, for example), leading to tons of scrambled up pieces. Still, it's a portable Catan! 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
The travel edition of Settlers is great, in that it basically works. Some things are not ideal, and the plastic bits are pretty small, but the fact that they were able to do a travel Settlers at all is great. It's not like I use it a lot, but still.

I also own the travel version of the Japanese Settlers: Rockman, which is better still - it's a tiny package with a magnetic board. It's not as aesthetic and not of the same quality as the Mayfair or Kosmos version, but it's just incredibly small, it's amazing how far the game was scrunched down while still remaining playable and reasonably visually appealing.

This is probably the version of Catan I play most often. Now, even if someone knocks that table a bit, the tiles and roads always remain in place. The only downside is that the numbers are always in the same place, so it takes a bit of the "choose the right starting point" element out of the game. That and the cards are really small.

I really enjoyed this as a simple 2 player version of settlers of catan.  A friend bought this for a trip to Australia and we really got use out of it playing it on buses, planes and in the back seat of the car on long drives along the coast of NSW.

Lacking some of the setup possibilties of the full game (numbers are fixed).  But as a travel game its hard to beat.  After all, it is Settlers.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Somewhat flimsy components, and while you can travel with this you don't want to play WHILE traveling.  Pieces do not snap in, they just lie in shallow depressions.  No provision to pause the game or prevent a hard bump from scattering poor Catan across the floor.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Sometimes the pieces don't fit snugly to the holes.  Also, the dessert position and numbers are not randomized (this makes the game rather even, though).

Otherwise, this still is Settler's of Catan!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
This gets a 6.5 for size only as gameplay is the same as the original.  It's nice that it's portable but a bit tricky to play with big fingers.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
While Settlers is a great game, this travel edition completely fails at its purpose for existing, being travel friendly. The box needs to be kept upright or the extremely tiny pieces will get mixed about and possibly lost.  The fact that the cards have been miniaturized in no way makes the game easier to take with you, just harder to play. The original game is actually MUCH easier to take with as the those componants will actually all fit into a smaller space then the travel board will and can be more easily secured.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Basically, the same game as the original only smaller, cuter, and more portable. The game play is nearly the same except for one minor alteration: The desert is always at the center of the board. I think this robs the games of some variety and spice. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I have not rated it higher, because of minor issues with the travel edition.  If anything, I'd recommend  getting full sized cards instead of the pee-wee ones in the set.

OK, Settlers is a classic, yada, yada, yada.  Meh.  I can take it or leave it.  I mean, it's nice every once in a while, but it's not an every night kind of game.  Plus, the whole wood for sheep thing gets old real fast. The travel version's pretty good, but I have trouble with the small cards.

The fixed numbers (and slightly off port positions) don't really bother me, except I think I don't like that the desert is always in the middle.

Settlers of catan is the original of the new generation of games for adults and whilst I used to enjoy it there are now too many expansion elements and to be honest it is beginning to feel a little dated as trading games have evolved since the Catan heyday.

The travel edition is nice however as I am usually the driver and my little one suffers from cronic car sickness this doesn't get played really.

A pint sized version of a good game. Worth purchasing if you'll have reasons to use the travel edition - the design makes it so that it really CAN be played anywhere, as long as you don't get carsick easily. Only requirement is a place to toss the dice, everything else snaps in place. It's pretty well designed, no complaints as far as construction or quality, and the few changes from the original shouldn't be a problem as long as you're not taking the game too seriously. The numbers and such being in the same place limits the replayability a bit, but if you're using it as a substitute while travelling, camping or whatever, you probably won't notice unless you're dedicating tons of time to the game.

This is the same game as Settlers.  It is in a smaller format, with pegs for pieces and pits for the hexes.  There is slightly less variability, as the desert occupies a fixed position (and numbers do not move around)

This rates much lower than my 8 for settlers because the cards are very small and easy to lose.  As a travel game, your cards are too easy to mess up.  The pieces are a little small for my large hands.  I don't think this format is a successful travel game.

Ideal Players: 3-4

Description: Classic game with components for travel.

Pro: Interchangeable parts make each game unique. Card slots in box keep decks from shifting. Nice area in box to roll dice. Perfect way to play a board game while on the road.

Con: Not too much complexity or theme (but more than any other travel game I've ever seen).

I bought this at a FGLS before going away on our honeymoon.  On th eway home, I got in traffic due to an accident.  Luckily, having just purchased it, I was able to give it go right then and there. Luckily, I never had the chance to play it on our honeymoon though. In a pinch, it's great to have. However, the bad things are:The desert is stationary though I have no idea why they did that. You have to roll the dice...somewhere. I wish they had included a "popper" dice (remember Aggrevation?) My biggest complaint is that the robber has no peg or anyway to attach him to the board, he's loose. That was pretty boneheaded.

Plastic-covered map with pegged roads and settlements. However, the pieces don't lock in well and there are still the cards to deal with — in other words, it's just a miniature board that's good until you go over a bump. NOT valuable.

HUGE MINUS: expensive - especially when you can replace it with the much cheaper and much better app!

I taught it to my five year old son and he gets the basics and a bit more. In fact when I was teaching it to my wife, he kept interjecting to correct/remind me of the rules. Great game. 

As for the traveller's box. It works if a bit on the small side.

Settlers the game is a 7 in my book. This travel edition, however, only gets a 5 since it doesn't travel too well. If the pieces stayed in place and the cards were normal in size, my ranking would be higher. Neither change would effect the portability, but would make it easier to play and store while on the go. I have the imported edition, but I hear the Mayfair one has similar problems.

Nice compact size for easy carrying. The tiles are set into a plastic tray so the playing board is always stable. Gameplay is the same as the original game, except that the numbers are immovable and permanent, so the resource tiles all have a hole in the center to let the number be visible. Desert has no hole and is thus always in the center, where there is no number. (Alternative solution: cover the numbers, and punch a hole in the desert card.)

Negative things compared to normal Catan: The cards are a bit too small, making them hard to handle. Having the desert always in the middle limits the game a bit. Hence, -1 point compared to normal Catan.

It's catan ... but small and travel sized. They should have made the robber able to fit over the numbers ... it's annoying when it bounces around. Also, the numbers are fixed and the desert has to be in the center. There are a number of ways they could have created the board to fix these issues, but they didn't. Sadly it does take away from the experience. Unless you travel a lot, I'd save my money on this one.

A complete version of Settlers miniaturized for traveling should be a wonderful thing. Unfortunately the key word here is "miniature". Everything is so small it makes it difficult to use. Furthermore, I don't know how anyone would get 3-players around this tiny thing. Instead I wish they would have focused on a 2-player variant specifically for travel.

Barring the small (cute) size of the components, it plays just as easy as 'regular' Catan. Board is a bit less random, but that doesn't seem to hurt too much.

RATING: 6
Game in a Nutshell: The big game shrunk down to 'travel' size.

Played as: 2,3,4 players

Pros: The quintessential gateway game. Bought this in hopes that it'll be accepted by world-traveling backpackers as the new chess. SoC gets big points for the sole reason that it gets so many people hooked on boardgames. The portability factor saves space in the closet.

Cons: Once played enough, all it comes down to is playing with what the dice gods hand you while not being deep enough in other areas to keep my complete interest.  Specific to the travelers edition- I miss being able to move the desert and to a lesser extent, the number placement. Also, teaching this version to a new gamer can cause confusion with 'spacey' gamers as to which little holes are for roads and which are for settlements.

Other: Rated particularly for the travel edition, not SoC altogether. It still gets the job done, but the big version is decidedly better.

Best Use: A portable way of giving non-gamers a taste of the Catan world when the full-size is unavailable.

Why'd they put the desert in the middle?  Definitely the worst place for making the gameplay flow quicker as there are less resource spots.  Surely not too much bother to put the desert on one of the many coastal spaces, not too close to a port.  They missed a trick there, although the game still is good fun.

We keep this in our trailer for camping.  The fixed desert and number locations seem constricting at first and the cards are really small, but the game still plays well.  We prefer the original for it's size but this ones great for the road.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is a good game, the rating is for the travel edition only. The parts are very very small, curiously small. The illustrations for the various commodities are very difficult to tell apart. They should have just color-coded them. The holes in the board for putting in roads are round instead of square, so the roads free rotate, which makes little sense. The board is sturdy plastic, but they should have built in angled card slots on the sides, rather than making you use the insert tray in the box. This edition takes up space disproportionate to the amount of squinting you have to do to identify the pieces. Great game, but could have been done better.

RATING: 6
I thought this would be a good portable edition, but:
1) you need to baggie all the crap because the insert is useless
2) the roads are shite, larger than the towns
3) it's all just too small

All the goodness of Settlers in a handy fifth-size box.  My only complaint is that the desert is always in a fixed position (the center of the board) but that needed to be done to work out the number distribution.  Loss of a half-point for that.----I log plays of this one under the main Settlers entry.

Same as the base game except that the desert is always in the center (makes some difference, but not much) and it's cute. Should rate higher for how often I used to play Settlers, but I hardly ever play the game now.

I love Catan, but it's not a great game for someone who is often on the move, so I thought I'd give the travel edition a go. It's a great little adaptation, but I'd forgotten how basic the original game was, and I really miss the trading and defence aspects of the the expansions.

I would only bring this version if luggage space is real consideration. Otherwise, the tiny bits are just too fiddly. And I do miss the variable setup.

Pros: Small
Already built with inset hex spots

Cons: Numbers fixed on board
Desert stationary
Pieces hard to hold

Conclusion: A nice little inexpensive version of the original.  Plays the same except for the initial startup.  And it's great for traveling with.  This is working well in the lunch hour.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
It works quite well and certainly solves the problem of playing Catan most anywhere. 

It would be neat, but clearly impractical, if all games had such an option.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 4
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 4
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 2
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3


Overall - 3.75

RATING: N/A
(+~20 Plays before I started counting)

This game has been with me through fire and "hell". Literally, since it was played even in the breaks of military exercises during my military service.

Compared to the original, it's not as pretty and most importantly not as modular.

Update: I have removed my rating as even though this is still a good game, I'll never again choose to play it since I have the original. If I want something portable, I'll take another game.

Not terribly well-designed for travel. The snap-in board is okay, and I heartily endorse standardizing the numbers to reduce the number of fiddly bits. But there are still *lots* of fiddly bits running loose in the box. Seems like a more Simply Catan-like approach could have helped with that. Plus, the bits don't plug into the board as securely as they could.

Got this in Bietigheim when traveling in Germany (2006). German edition, of course (doesn't matter much since we all know the cards by heart at this point - but fun to learn some German along the way). Nowhere near as nice as the standard edition and the bits & cards are super small. Good for taking along on a trip though. The few plays it got was while I was still on my Germany trip. Decided to trade - got Balloon Cup for it at Montreal Mathtrade February 2009.

RATING: 8.5
The travel version satisfied 2 requirements, a game to take in hand luggage on holiday, and an English version of Settlers (I have the German version of the full game). This game has got a lot more plays than the original as I have time to play on holiday! The limitations of fixed numbers and desert location do not cause serious issues. I always pack a 'deck of dice' to reduce the randomness. Sadly my wife also regularly beats me at this version as well! 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It's settlers, what else can I say? Great family game, casual, but with some degree of depth. Just what I like. Travel edition is essentially identical to the full game, but it has FIXED numbers on the grid (tiles can still be random).

You also can't expand travel edition as easily.

Would be better if it was actually constructed to travel well.  Too many loose bits in order to just carry it in a pack.  Would have been better served with some nice bags to put components in.

Settlers of Catan Travel Edition is, as the name says, a Travel Edition of The Settlers of Catan. The rules of the game are the same, but there are some changes between the two editions: No Expansions: In the Travel Edition - it is not possible to add any expansions to the regular game, so it is a 3 or 4 players game only. Pre determined Desert location: The hex containing the Desert is always the one in the middle of the board. Pre determined numbers: The numbers for production are also pre determined on the board. That is a natural follow up to the previous item. Pre determined port location: Although the individual port locations may vary, the place where they could be sited is pre determined. So the numbers for production, where a port exists, are always the same, and there is never a port near the Desert. Snap in bits: The roads, villages and cities are all snapped into the board during game play, so it is difficult to mess with the board. But the Robber is still loose on the board, and, as you need somewhere to throw the dice, you will still require a table upon which to play the Travel Edition.

Very cute, but it's a "mini," and not a "travel," edition, as the insert without some cover (e.g. old wargame counter trays, or Rum & Pirates) spills components everywhere.  Bags work, but there's still some sprawl.  And the tiny ports (why fill the graphic space with pointless blue edging?) aren't well-considered. Functional (barely), but coulda been MUCH better.

So I bought this version when I was so into Catan and playing it all the time.  I bought this for long car rides and when I would go Camping with my exgirlfriends family. Needless to say it was a pretty rough version.  the Numbers were solidified so it didn't lend to using different strategy from game to game like normal Catan.  but it got to the point that this game was left out in my garage and got destroyed and it didn't bother me and to me that's saying something.

Very well-done implimentation of the boardgame. The differences is the distribution of the numbers changes the game and makes it take longer, not necessarily a great thing. But as an actual travel edition it works very well. I wouldn't want to play this version every time, however.

Good for travel - go figure... everything plugs into a little board so nothing flies around. Pieces are small though and could be easily lost so the box itself needs to be travelized... i.e. stuff a piece of foam into it so stuff does not mix up when it is packed and shaken.

I haven't actually played this travel version, but I would rather take some card game, dice game, or other smaller title than this if I was traveling. Of course it could work on a plane, but for at most 3 players then. It's more a travel version of the game for the destination, rather than something to play on a train, ship or plane.

Maybe I just haven't figure this one out, but the mechanics leave something to be desired, and the press your luck mechanic doesn't seem to pay off that much. I'd be willing to give this one another shot with the right players though.

Ok filler. Horrible Rule book missing parts which can make certain characters unplayable. Once you get the errata it's playable and kinda fun. Very Swingy, Luck base. You can have three characters alive in first turn and a one card comes out and you can't defeat it because you have nothing to kill it. Therefore it's a 4 treasure swing in the first round.
I will keep it. It's not worth more than $10 (that's what I paid)

Very fun game. My wife and I had a great time playing. Rules could use a little more clarification on some parts (almost all questions were answered in forums). I would definitely recommend.

RATING: 6
Simple game with not much challenge.  Played a few times and then sold it, as it just didn't seem like something I wanted to play very often.  Not like there was anything wrong with it, it just didn't keep me interested enough to play again.

press your luck game. If you like Dungeon Roll, you will like this!
Played a few times, no desire to come back.
Too many other games in my collection I would rather play.

Got this for Christmas 2015.

I like this marginally better than Dungeon Roll because there is a bit more player interaction and thus less down-time. Pretty fun (but the rulebook left out some important stuff).

At least four people I know love this and request it (and they normally let me choose games). I think it's okay, good fun. Not excellent.

Similar to Dungeon Roll. Dungeon of fortune is a bit better so I decided to get this instead.  A light dungeon crawler game with special powers and leveling up.  Not bad.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Contrary to the ratings, I felt that this game was better than Dungeon Roll, however, still do not like it.  It will probably get destroyed by my children as they get older and start playing games on their own... I'll allow it to make that sacrifice so that other, better games may live.

Quick, light game with a theme I like, but just not enough player interaction to make it that engaging...

Rated 5 after 1 play (and that's probably a little generous.) I was hoping for a little more push-your-luck, but it lacks active treasures like Dungeon Roll and so it becomes much more evident when your turn must be over.

RATING: 6
Cute competitive loot race.  Fun but a bit too light for my personal taste.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The rules are very confusing and does a poor job at explaining the turns. I have yet to play this game correctly or with a good idea on what to actually do.
But fun press-your-luck game. Pro-tip: Watch Rahdos playthru and toss the rulebook.

It can be fun with the right people, who know how to play a Push-Your-Luck game.  We shortened the victory conditions because it tends to get repetitive towards the end.

Fun family game, nice revamp of Dungeon Roll. Easy enough for my five year old to play (one of his favorites).

So having played this game once, it left a sour taste. Picking it back up a year later, I'm really enjoying it. The game is pretty simple, if badly explained. The componens are fine quality and do the job well. The bush your luck element is sometimes there, and sometimes not. At times you could get a good run of easy to deal with cards, and the next time run out of party members very fast, and you have to give the bravery bonus away. I get that this "luck" is half of the game, but it feels very easy to tell when and when you should not push. That said, I'm looking forward to introducing this to some of my friendos who like lighter games.

RATING: 8
Once you learn to play, it's a very fast paced and entertaining game. There aren't many lulls in the game as players usually decide quickly to leave the dungeon or to press their luck. Everyone I've shown the game to really enjoys it and wants a copy of their own. The instructions are quite lacking in detail but, with help from this site and YouTube, it's easy to get up an running.

This is a very simple, luck-based push your luck game, but it's fun for what it is. It's a good game if you just want something quick and light that doesn't take much brain power.

Seems like an improvement on Dungeon Roll (especially at keeping more than 2 players engaged), but I'm not sure when I'll get to play this. Dungeon Roll is at least a fun enough little solo, whereas this...isn't.

Okay Press-Your-Luck Light Dungeon Crawl. Plays quick. More interaction than Dungeon Roll has.

Good Family Game! Casual Game! Beer-N-Pretzels Game!

like dungeon roll, but with cards. Kind cloney. I guess I was expecting a slightly different dungeon crawl style. I like the different tiers of character levelling though.

Have you heard of or played Dungeon Roll? Essentially the same thing but using cards. It was collective opinion of the table that they enjoyed this game more than Roll. I very much enjoy push your luck so I liked this one a bunch. I don't think 6p is the correct number to play with but 3-4 would be a good fit. I look forward to playing again soon.

Ganz nettes Spiel für zwischendurch, dass sich in unserer Spielrunde aber wohl nur selten durchsetzen wird- dafür ist es einfach zu glücksabhängig und willkürlich. Die Vielfalt der Charaktere ist allerdings dennoch beeindruckend!

Not a bad game, but I would have enjoyed it if there was some more artwork on the cards.  It is essentially a dungeon crawl and I know this may sound silly, but I just couldn't get into it with just silouettes of the dragon heads.

RATING: 4
Oof. Better than it's predecessor, Dungeon Roll, but that's not saying much. Completely random, and the only interaction seems to be stealing coins from people. The rulebook is also pretty awful for such a simple game, with an important rule regarding the scrolls completely absent.

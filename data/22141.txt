RATING: 7
Ticket to ride with higher production values and a bit more complexity. Elimination by corruption ensures that players watch each other, but otherwise very little player interaction with the exception of claiming pieces first and an auction mechanic.

RATING: 7.5
A nice light resource management game.  I was afraid that the game would be nothing but fancy bits and no substance, but was pleasantly surprised.  The corruption token system is a nice balancing mechanism.  Artwork is great.

A fun game of resource management. I love some mechanics (some face up cards, corruption) but find the way the game stops when people place mosaic tiles to be annoying. Sometimes it seems that people can get hosed by the cards. It's a cool game though, and moves right along. I have a number of friends who would really enjoy this game.

I was pleasantly surprised by this.  Upon reading the rules, I had expected a dog's dinner of a game - way too much froth and mess and not much underneath.  In fact, it's not nearly as much like that as you'd imagine.  Not for the first time, DoW have come up with a good game, but an overly wordy and poorly set out rule book.

Anyway, there's lots to recommend this though some of it is familiar: the way the cards are half up, half down in the stack (simple but brilliant), the choice of which row to place your first card (not unlike San Marco), the corruption and the crocodile stopping one player from winning (echoes of High Society), the sanctuary (echoes of enclosures in Cathedral and placement in PoF).  And of course, though the game is perhaps overproduced, it is beautiful to look at.  Newcomers would be drawn in, but the complicated rules would flummox them to start with.

There is a possibility of Analysis Paralysis in the game, but regular groups can chastise each other to think about their moves before their turn.

It will be interesting to see if the game gets better or worse on future plays, but for now, I enjoyed it.

I was turned off this game by the boardgameswithscott.com video.  I thought I should give it a try, though, because I didn't like the video for Rum & Pirates either, but ended up loving that game.  Cleopatra had several innovative pieces...that just somehow didn't add up to fun experience for me.

RATING: 6
+ Great components; The crocodile eating the most corrupted person is a pretty unique and tense game mechanic.
- The card collection and playing is really not that interesting or even more complicated than Ticket to Ride.


Why it's previously-owned:
Even with its beautiful table presence, I would honestly never choose this over a favored gateway game like Asara or Blue Moon City.  
This was gifted to my friend to start his own game collection.

RATING: 6
A game of hand management and.. errr.. architecture.  Similar to Ticket to Ride in that you're turn is spent either gathering resource cards or spending them to accomplish an objective.  The corruption amulets add a nice aspect to the game, forcing players to balance their depravity.  And, of course, the bits are just wonderful - more plastic than some cosmetic surgeries.

The downside is that the game isn't all that deep.  It's not bad - I would play it from time to time - but it's unlikely ever to be a must play.  Even so, it's a good enough game that you can justify your purchase and ooh and aah over the plastic.  Totally worth it.

RATING: 7
The uniqueness of this game consists in it's design: you have to build a 3D palace for Cleopatra with obelisks, walls, statues, etc. It's visual concept is great. The gameplay itself it is relatively easy: pick and play a card. The twist is in the corruption points: the player who collects the most, at the end of the game is out, even if it has the most victory points. Overall is nice, but not so deep.

RATING: 7.2
At first, this looks like a smooth set-collecting + pentominoes game with a lot of chrome.  But the 'most corruption automatically loses but otherwise it counts for zip' rule makes this at heart a game of brinksmanship and luck pushing.  It's a bit like the Dungeon Lords evilometer on steroids.  I'd be up for another game.

Building Cleopatra's palace. Look's great and has wonderful game pieces. Use resources to build palace but try to avoid using corrupt sources to obtain your materials and thus avoid being thrown to the crocodiles. Fun game.

RATING: 7.2
In Cleopatra, players acts as architects and aims to become rich by building the most magnificient and valuable parts of her palace.  In the game, players have to collect different materials like, 'Lapis', 'Stone', 'Wood', 'Artisan' etc to build castle parts like 'Sphinx', 'Door Frame', 'Mosiacs of the Gods', 'Throne' etc.  

Players can use good quality materials or use inferior materials to build the castle parts.  Though poor quality materials helps you to build faster, corrupt architects received corruption amulets for using them.  Besides players can also make use of worshippers of Sobek to help them get rich, but will also accumulate corruption amulets.

At the end of the game, when Cleopatra inspects her castle, she will offer the most corrupted architect to her sacred crocodile, Sobek and lose the game immediately.  Among those who are alive, the richest architect will be declared as the winner.

Good points: The game is interesting as there is a twist in the game.  Though a player may be the richest architect in the game, if the architect is also the most corrupted architect the player will still lose the game.  In the game, players have to remember the number of corruption tokens other players have received so as not to be fed to the sacred crocodile of Cleopatra.  The game is also more balanced as there are also ways of losing corruption amulets.

Bad points:  In the game there are 2 ways to get rid of corruption amulets.  Building Mosiacs of the Gods and form Sanctuaries is a good way to reduce the number of corruption amulets.  Another way to reduce corruption amulets is by making Offerings to the Great Priest.  However it is very difficult to activate an Offering.  Moreover after making tribute to the Great Priest, players who have not offered the highest tribute would have to gain more corruption amulets which can be frustrating as players not only gain corruption amulets, but also lose their riches.

RATING: 6
Nice bits and a decent enough game to play with them.  For me, corruption both adds interest to the game and is its weak point.  There's a nice tension between minimising your corruption and the temptation to always use a bit more.  Getting rid of corruption is one of the more challenging elements.  On the other hand, I dislike the memory/guessing involved in determining how much corruption is safe to hold. I also dislike the blind bidding luck-fest to lose or gain corruption when the ankh dice all come up. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Cool components and interesting mechanics - the mixing of the deck with half of the cards face up and the corruption markers are neat.  I worry about this game getting a little old after the first few plays though.

RATING: 7.1
rating after a single play.  Athough I was the player thrown to the crocs at the end of the game, this one didn't turn me off of additonal plays.  Interesting hand management in the game and the concept that some market cards are face up and some are face down is pretty novel.  I didn't pay particular attention to what buildings reap the best rewards and also what bonuses would go with certain items, nor did I worry about corruption my first game.  Now that I have played a game I'd be interested in another to weigh luck vs. skill.

There are so many fun puzzles to sort out in this game.  Between the resource selection where random resources are visible while other remain hidden to the different ways to score points (frequently building off of other players' moves) to the corruption mechanic that knocks the most corrupt player immediately out of the game, I really enjoy this game.  It's been in my collection so long, though, that it doesn't make it to the table as often these days.  Need to remedy that situation.

An fun light euro game that blends various mechanics of other "gateway" games like Ticket to Ride (card drafting/ hand management) and Settlers (resource management).

RATING: 5
{1 play, 5 players} Didn't feel like there was much "game" there - take cards you need and then trade 'em in for points.  I never felt like I should maybe take a set of cards away from someone else when there was a better set for me.  I was just doing my own thing, very solitaire-y.  Yes, there's a timing issue, as far as cashing stuff in, but not enough of one, I thought, to give the game any real tension. Also, most of the timing issues came near the end in our game, and by that time, if you got beat out, you had no Plan B you to fall back on - as opposed to, say, Ticket to Ride, an unfair comparison - that game is all about timing and Plan B's - but you get the gist.  The good news: the lack of "game" means that it moves pretty fast.  And I had fun with the puzzley aspect of trying to get the best out of those garden placements.  And trying to maximize my score.  Oh, and the bidding.  This was the best (and most fun) interaction in the game... but it didn't happen enough - only once for us.  Maybe you're supposed to roll after each *individual* build, as opposed to after a player does all their builidng that turn?  I'd play it again, but I'd be surprised if this was still hitting the table down the line.

RATING: 6
Interesting mechanism from High Society where players push their luck with the curse cards and balance "not being last".  Would be a 5, but it gains a point for having a cool board/construction mechanism.  Usually I don't put a big emphasis on appearance, but this integrates it very well and makes a nice visual piece.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Not only are the plastic bits cool (you actually build a palace as you play), but the game play is delightfully devious.  To win you must make the most money building.  You can't really compete without gaining corruption, but the player with the most corruption at the end of the game automatically loses.  Easy to teach, deep strategy.

overproduced, underfunned.  i was hoping that the corruption loss would add something interesting to what was being explained as a blah game, but my impression after a single play is that players don't have nearly enough control over it.  outside of that it's just set collection and play, something ticket to ride does much better, faster, simpler, and with higher tension.  every game doesn't need to be distilled, but i don't think there's much going on underneath the fluff on this one.

RATING: 8
Fun game.  There's a lot going on, and I think I'll enjoy it more now that I know what's going on.  The corruption is a nice addition, and the components are pretty cool.  It really does suffer from downtime, however.  Maybe that will go away as people get more familiar with it.

RATING: 7.5
Loaded with bits that promise of lots of game, but actual game play is lighter than might be expected.  Basic play is as an influence game with added tension coming from the use of the corruption tokens.  This latter element may not be popular with some players as it eliminates a player from contention at the end of the game, but I think it adds tension.  game play is quite fast and the game is likely end sooner than expected.  It is not a particularly deep game, but it is a pleasant enough game.

Interesting game with beautiful production that one comes to expect from Days of Wonder. At first glance, I thought the game would fill the same niche as Settlers of Catan with a more even distribution of resource production. I like the card selection mechanic with some cards face up, and some cards face down. I like the corruption mechanic. In the end though, the game suffers from the same problem I have with Settlers: it just plays too long. Figuring out what to build, especially the mosaics, takes quite a bit of time and one would have to play several times to get the building costs down. So as a gateway game, I think Settlers does it slightly better.

Yes, it%u2019s a lot of eye candy. Yes, they could have done the same thing with tiles and shaved a good $10 to $15 off the price. But it just looks cool! With the winner being the one with the most money, the temptation is to build as much as possible even it that means gaining corruption for the effort. But as the person with the most corruption is automatically eliminated, it becomes a balancing act of profit versus guaranteed loss which is what I think provides the staying power for this game.

This game plays with a lot of variety in choices and strategy yet the game play itself isn't overcomplicated. Corruption is almost unavoidable and everyone accrues it. That's okay because there are ways to strategically reduce your corruption. It's a balance/competition between wealth and corruption amongst all the players. Great fun.

I like this game, but it seems like it needs to be played with a certain type of group. If someone takes the game too seriously, I don't think it would be that much fun.

I quite like this game and feel that it is underated on this site.  It is not very complex, and it falls squarely into the family game camp, which is its intended audience, but there are plenty of meaningful choices.  It is very possible to decipher what other players are trying to build, whichleads to fun, competitive building races.  It can be a challenge to maximize points from every stack of cards taken.  The production value is expremely high.  I always feel of sence of accomplishment afterwards because I have build something by the end of the game.  The corruption pros and cons are a highlight for me as well.  There are so many things that I like about this game.  It deserves a bit more attention.

A game that is simple to learn and yet has some fun strategic depth.  I like the way that players are challenged to avoid corruption while at the same time using it to aquire the most money.  The plastic really adds to the game, but it can be frustrating that there are so few ways to get rid of corrupt cards.  This is the first game I have played where a player is eliminated and then the high score of the remaining players wins, and I really like that mechanic.  Note:  We always play that the markets are stocked randomly, but the rules say players are supposed to decide which market to place cards in.  We find this too time-consuming, and it doesn't add much to the game, so we left it out.

I really like this game.  Beautiful to look at, and knowing somebody will be definitely eliminated from winning because they used too much corruption is always a nice tense addition.  Simple in its mechanics (you either draw or play) there's still some strategy, on when and what to build, and enough variation with corrupt people to switch up the game play.  A keeper for me and can be enjoyed with my 9-year-old daughter up to my 68-year old mom.

The "croc eats the most corrupt" feature of this game drew me in.  Fantastic bits and many clever mechanics make for a really enjoyable game that doesn't get too deep on the strategy... but there is some strategy.

Rather like Ticket to Ride in a way (though certainly more complex and heavier). The card set collection is much better than TTR, faster and with a nice mechanic to avoid everyone drawing huge hands.

I liked the corruption mechanic. It isn't unique but it is a nice addition to a game of this sort, and the pieces, well the pieces are amazing.

All in all then, lots of fun. It will certainly get more plays.

Played this at KublaCon. I didn't enjoy this one too much. Maybe all the hype raised my expectations too much.

The components are magnificent, but look past that and there's actually a darn good game here. Collect sets of cards by taking one of three stacks from the marketplace, then use different card combinations to build different features of Cleopatra's temple. 
The main criticism people have leveled at this game has been lack of player interaction. I disagree; pay attention to what's going on and you'll see plenty of opportunities for screwage-of-thy-neighbor.

Once again, Days of Wonder makes a kind of so-so game and saves it with one single great rule - the corruption.

Like all of the choices that one has to make and that you have to make them quick because someone else is going to build that piece right before you do and you know it. Love the card mechanic of the market being half face up and half face down. Seems pretty original. Game may be too quiet though as there were a lot of silent times throughout the games I've played that felt odd on a gaming night. All in all good game.

Okay set collection game.  I'm not fond of the card acquisition mechanism; luck of draw is high, even with half of the supply face-up.  Constantly need to worry about setting up opponents due to the building mechanics & point system.  Biggest gripe is doing the math for building... usually there are multiple options, and you would have faster turns with a spreadsheet to quickly compute all of them.  As for the tribute/offering it seems like the highest you would want to bid is about 10 talents.

It has a lot of really cool elements, but bogs down with AP too easily.  I think it would play better if all of the tainted character cards were replaced with "Sand" cards.

Mecanicamente es muy Bruno Cathala. Estilo familiar, mecanicas faciles de aprender y dominar por cualquiera, y ademas incluye algunas cosas que ya se han visto en otros juegos como la coleccion de cartas (Abyss/Histrio).
Destacable por el tema de los tokens de verguenza que hacen que siempre tengas que estar atento a que no se te vayan de las manos o quedas eliminado, es facil que el que mas dinero tiene sea el que queda eliminado.
Y el que todo lo que construyes quede reflejado fisicamente con esas piezas de plastico es increible.
Muy divertido y realmente precioso.

Good if you want a light weight game or 'cross-over' game for families/non-gamers. Corruption element is the part that pulls it up, plus it looks very attractive. Works surprisingly well with 2 using the variant rules on the DOW site (corruption is considered a tax, increasing as a triangle series). However I could see it suffering from analysis paralysis with the wrong group, especially on the placement of the mosaics. *** update - traded, so doubt I'll be playing this much again.

RATING: 5.5
This game is enormous overproduced. The game equipment is awesome, but the game behind at least average. It`s a resource collectible game with less choices. Pick-up Resources (3 Choices) or Build. That`s all. You have to handle 10 Cards or more an then look at six different buildings with various costs. The building part lacks lucidity. The only shining mechanism is the corruption system, that the player with the most looses the game. This can generate some tension. But at all it has an unfished feeling and is just a highly overproduced card game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Nothing very strategic about this one.  Just opportunitstically grab resources and maximize your builds.  Then cross your fingers you don't have the most corruption.  Still, I like the theme and graphic design, and it's fun for me.

Played this for the first time at BGG Con.  I'm always a sucker for a game with an Egyptian theme and ths one dosen't have a totally pasted on feel to it either.  I found the bits top notch, the gameplay interesting and length about right.  I don't see it hitting the table often but could be a very nice gateway game for non-gamer friends.  Besides who dosen't like feeding people to crocodiles?

*edit* Honestly it's a stupid game but I like it anyway.  It's easy to teach, pretty to look at and dosen't tax the brain cells.  Think of it as that totally crappy band you like anyway.  (Kiss, Iron Maiden, etc..)

Arrived October 3rd, 2008.  This is another one that I happened across on BGG when just browsing thru lists.  The idea of the game looked interestingly different so I bought it off ebay.

RATING: 7
An enjoyable gaming experience with theme and tactics nicely blended. The temptation to take/avoid corruption is the centerpiece, but there are several other interesting elements that make this an engaging game. For example, deciding which resource cards to acquire to maximize talent gains (points) for the various building projects; weighing the cost of character cards which provide advantages with a price of corruption; building now at the quarry or accumulating resources at the market; and even whether to encourage another offering to bid off corruption. However, the choice of which building to buy is usually fairly simple and obvious, except when trying to figure out how to place the mosaic pieces. This may be why the game does not rate so highly. The face up/down resource cards are a unique feature to the other familiar mechanics.

Like most titles in the Days of Wonder catalog, this light family game has great components, but ultimately the lack of interesting choices kills it for me. I had the impression I could do as well as my cards would let me, not the other way round. Managing corruption was really the only interesting bit.

Interesting mechanism of most corruption amulets/elimination. I also like the offering bid mechanism. 
However, the main thrust of card drafting does not turn my crank.

Putting all the pieces back in the box was a pain in the ass.

RATING: 8
This is a very cool game! I like the mechanics. Overproduced, yeah. But there's enough going on, but not too much, and the card drafting is just right - not too angst-ridden, but you do see stuff you want slip through your fingers.

In my game, I rarely used corruption but by the end had 8, which surprised me. I managed to win, but barely - having no Anubis figures in gardens.

What's more, Joanna likes this too! Unusual, but true - a game we both enjoy. I see this getting played for years.

Per podcaster Giles Pritchard "Gorgeous looking game. Other players I have played with really enjoyed it. I iked it, but didn't feel it was that fantastic. My concern is really with the cards you need to collect. The beauty of Settlers of Catan is that the card combos required are quite simple, in this game they are not simple, and this can make 'seeing' your options with a hand of cards much harder than in Settlers. I like this game, I think it is better than Settlers, but I wish the card combos were more straight forward."

Enjoyed the first game of this a lot. Not much player interaction but each player had a decent amount of choices to make during their turn. The game moved along at a good clip. Had a minor hiccup over how sanctuaries functioned but that aside the first play went very smooth. Surprisingly, it seemed like we didn't have a lot of corruption. Maybe that was due to it being a 4 player game. 
The components are very nice and help create a sense of really building a palace. It would be nice to get them painted though.

Highly derivative game with an impressive presentation but ultimately doesn't excite.  The use of the box is from Niagara, the player with the most corruption losing is from High Society, and the card/set collection is common to many German games.

This was our first foray into DoW products, and let me tell you, yes, glitz and glam do appeal!  Saw it on sale at Eagle Games for a mere $20, so I had to pick it up.  The bits are really fun, and the "everything in its own place" aspect of the board and storage hits my OCD sweet spot.  Ok, the game is not super-deep, but it takes a few simple mechanics and works them well.  This isn't a game you play for hours, which is good - it couldn't sustain more than a 45min-1hour long experience.  The two player variant works well enough; perhaps corruption is a little too weak, but otherwise, it works ok.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
We had a good time with this one. The components are great, and it was neat to put the palace together piece by piece. The mechanic that makes the game, of course, is the incorporation of corruption tokens, which really changes the way you play: building sanctuaries with mosaic tiles and bidding for the priest become the most important decisions you make during the game. It's pretty luck-dependent with the cards, though. One missing card can possibly ruin your game, although you can find ways of getting what you need using the special cards.

RATING: 7
I know my rating of 7 doesn't sound great, but really, after the pasting this game has received I expected it to be much worse. It wasn't. It was pretty decent. In fact, I think I like it the best of all of Days of Wonder's multi-player big-box games. I definitely found it more engaging that Ticket to Ride. Some tough choices, the game moves along pretty well, and I like the tension on Corruption. It makes the game more interesting than the purely tactical Ticket to Ride.

Folks have complained about the production, and I think that's fair. I think C&tSoA really wants to be a $25-$35 medium-sized box game. It's fairly light, and I doubt highly replayable. So the $50 list and the extravegant components are pure overkill. That said, the over-production for me is not so severe that it actually presents a problem; it's not as bad as Diamant, for example, which was a $15 game in a totally gratuitous $40 package. It's more like McMulti - gratuitous, but it does make the game look nice and allows you to easily see a lot of stuff at-a-glance.

The biggest drawback is probably the scoring for the various monuments, which is why I doubt the game will have significant replayability. You're an idiot if you buy only one Sphinx, for example, and while Mosaics and Walls have some scoring synergy, it's almost impossible to synchronize them to your own benefit. I think that ultimately, the interplay between the different monuments and how they score doesn't really work. Because of the lack of functioning scoring synergies, it probably means that the obvious strategy (always take the pile with the most cards, then build whatever you can afford) is the best. All this doesn't kill the game, but neither does it bode well for the game's staying power.

Bottom line, I think this is probably another classic Days of Wonder game - a decent game, but a lot more flash than bang. Not the disaster Shadows over Camelot was, neither does it demonstrate the same professionalism as Kosmos, Hans im Gluck, or alea. Like everything with overproduced bits these days it seems, the pieces came at the price of the last three rounds of playtesting that would have turned it into a real winner.

In with a solid 7 after a promising 3-player first game. A lot to take in on one play, so this is likely to move a point one way or the other after it's hit the table more often. UPDATE: Down to a 6. You rarely feel that you have meaningful choices. UPDATE: Down to a 5- game play not worth the set-up/breakdown time. UPDATE: Down to a 3, don't think I'll want to play this again.

Beautiful components.

Some nice mechanics (corruption; varying payoffs; character cards) and one seemingly contrived mechanic that did nothing for us (half the draw pile is face-up).

Also a bit too much down time as players min-max their decisions. (sort of an ironic statement coming from a wargamer, no?)

RATING: 6
Build what you can with whatever materials you can get.  The interesting part of the game is the corruption points and the various ways you can rid yourself of it.  I like mechanisms where one player is eliminated even though they may have the most points (as in High Society),  and the corruption did a good job of this.  Overall, the game wasn't all that exciting though.  Although their games are certainly flashy, Days of Wonder has definitely become a try-before-you-buy company.

Wow. This took FOREVER to set up the first time with our game high schoolers group. I was afraid, given the complete lack of engagement by the teens at the beginning of the game, that it would flop. But by the end they were engaged and enjoying it. And as I recall, the final score was very close--no one was "out of it." I just wish it wouldn't take so long to set up . . . Oh, and the bits are amazing.

Conceptually clever but, the card art and player aids do not help enough to clarify the combinations that you are trying to collect.  The first play is slow and tedious and requires patience on behalf of the players to stay interested.

I love boxes full of pieces but, the chrome in this game does not add to the pleasure of game play for me.  It further obscures a card game that is, at its heart, simple and clever.

For my taste, this is a weak implementation of a potentially fun and thought-provoking, rummy-type card game.

This game is shallow, but it's definitely fun.  I love the balancing of the corruption and the death to the most corrupt player mechanic.  The game is ridiculously overproduced, as it not much more than a fancy rummy variant.  The fact that it is a card game is a great indicator of the amount of randomness you can expect.  I think this wouldn't be a big deal if the game play time were shorter.  My rating reflects the high game play time*randomness factor.

My wife and her dad in particular had a blast playing this game – and so have all of the players to whom I’ve introduced this game! The game is actually not that good if it wasn’t for that one awesome mechanic which makes the game very unique – the corruption! I feel that this mechanic sets the game apart from the big crowd of average, light eurogames. 

If you don’t know what it’s about, it’s as simple as this: in order to win, you will need to take some corruption tokens during the game (if you don’t, it will be almost impossible to win). These are kept secret and only revealed in the end of the game – and the player with the most corruption tokens instantly loses even though he has the most VP! This makes the game very tense. There are a couple of ways to get rid of the corruption tokens during the game, one of which is a secret bidding – in which the player who bids the most victory points gets rid of 3 tokens while all of the other players gain 1, 2 or 3 tokens, and all of the bidden VP are lost! Also, you can place some Blokus-shaped pieces and get rid of corruption tokens this way, which is also a cool feature of the game.

The game is beautiful to look at and really is quite good considering it is basically just a card game in which you do ONE of two things... Because of the relatively simplicity of the gameplay, I don’t love it as much as others, but I still like it quite a lot.

I like the corruption mechanic this game has. Players can push themselves into a loss by being too greedy, and that gave a nice little twist.

One play with five players.  I'll say this: it was really fun to play, and it's great to look at.  I think five is too many, though.  In this game, you acquire cards (resources) and try to get the right kind to build pieces of the temple for points.  The problem is that it is very difficult to get the right cards.  The mechanism for getting cards is fun, but a little chaotic, and so with five, it's just too much time for the level of luck.  However, I'd be very happy to play it again.

Hidden money, hidden corruption tokens, long downtimes, disjointed spacial puzzle mechanism, and tacky beige plastic pieces. And a blind bidding coup de grace to round it all out. Maybe.

This is a game that I will not seek to play again. Not bad, just not good enough.

Components do not make the game.  Game play makes the game.  This game is fun and interesting, but it really has two basic flaws.  First, there is no element of trading or exchanging when you have cards you don't need.  Second, as more elements are built, the value of cards radically shifts and the balanced deck becomes filled with junk no one needs.  At best, this is an artificial balancing mechanic; at worst, it leaves a few players sitting on their hands.

Interesting game. Possibly not enough player interaction for me - everyone was really playing their own game with only limited situations where players impacted on each other (planning building around others doesn't really count imo as it is very difficult to determine a leader at any point in time). 

The mistake I made was paying to get rid of the scribe when I could have used it at the end for free to force a corruption bidding round. If I had done this I expect I wouldn't have been fed to the crocodiles at the end - would play this one again.

This game drips theme - from the pieces to the rules.  It involves both strategy and and element of push-your-luck as you try to figure out whether it's worth garnering more corruption to earn more money.  Or, gaining corruption to build mosaics to form sanctuaries to hide some corruption.  The corruption tokens are hidden inside pyramids during play.  Cards are drawn from the market.  Sets can be played to build elements of Cleo's building.  The game is timed by this building - as each element is built to completion, Cleo comes another step closer.  These sets can include tainted cards, playing them is one way to earn corruption.  The player who is most corrupt at the end of the game is fed to Cleo's crocodile.  The winner is determined among the remaining players.

Played for the first time tonight - tentative initial rating of 7.  A bit fiddly the first time through, though I would suspect things smooth out considerably upon subsequent plays.  I found it really difficult to limit my hand to 10 cards while trying to get the right combinations for building and therefore gathered a lot of corruption tokens (and ended up being fed to the croc) -- To an extent, I think luck of the draw hurt me, though next time I'll be more aware of how to use the mosaic tiles to my advantage and mitigate the corruption tokens.  Overall an enjoyable game -- seemed a bit long for what it should be, but that was likely because it was a first play.  Definitely worth the $20 it currently costs.

I liked this a lot more than Shadows, which is saying very little, as I didn't care for that. There's a real game in here. My main point of disinterest, however, is the lack of significance in what you build. Imagine Settlers where you get resources of different types, and you spend them to build things, except that all you get for building something is points. You don't build this to get that, that to get this, etc. Nor does building anything affect the resources you get. This bits, of course, are very showy. There's an Amun-Re-type sacrifice in there, but instead of coming up regularly, it only comes up based on dice, and one of my games it didn't come up at all, which was a bit deflating.

Typical Days of Wonder.  Great components and attractive, 3-D board.   Good game for non-gamers.  Mainly a resource management (card set collecting) game, and there is an auction component as well.
The unique part of this game, and the thing that makes it really enjoyable to play, is the corruption points.  To excel in this game, you will accumulate corruption.  The key is managing the corruption so that you don't have too much.  In the end, the player with the most corruption is disqualified before the victory points are even tallied. This is a fantastic game design element.

Several OLGS will occasionally have this game for around $25 and it is definitely worth getting at this price.

Very pretty, but I just feel that something is missing - it may be that the information you have regarding money and corruption held by you and others is too limited and that reduces the feeling of competition in the game.

I have upped the rating after the second playing. The mechanism to unload corrupt cards is to deliberately get a larger-than-ten-card hand so that you can discard several cards for just one point of corruption. The game is interesting and works well.

RATING: 4
The corruption mechanic is neat - but less cool than it could be, mostly because one has poor control over how much corruption one is taking. (Corrupt cards appear liberally and 50% face-down in the stacks; once a corrupt card is in your hand, it's very difficult to avoid taking the hit for it; and the auctions to reduce relative corruption don't happen particularly often. The only thing one has notable control over is building courtyards - but even there, one is limited by the random draws of resources and mosaic tiles alike.)

Similarly, the faceup/facedown market concept is neat, but not as interesting as it first seems - under most circumstances, the benefit of (more resources + denying another player many resources) makes the largest pile the best choice. (Not [i]always[/i]. But [i]most[/i] of the time. And on 75% of turns, that choice is your entire turn.)

The first does mitigate the second - if you're heavy on corruption, you can try to pull clean stacks from the market, even if they're smaller - but it's unreliable, and tends to give away piles of resources to whomever goes directly after the player who's gotten lots of corruption early on.

There's some fun here, some really cool concepts, and the bits are really neat - but I wouldn't own a copy if I hadn't been given it for free.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Components: Overproduced. There are a lot of components for what is basically just a drafting/collection game. The scoring might have been made a bit easier if the building pieces were just printed on a mat. I would have preferred if the backs of the cards were more distinguishable from the fronts, and if the pieces from the quarry were painted. Still, the game, when set up, is very interesting to look at. The artwork on the quality cards is great. The player aid is exceptional.

Experience: A bit like Ticket to Ride: I eagerly draft specific cards, racing against my opponents when I think they might be trying to build the same thing I am. Artisans are scarce. The cards combine in many interesting ways, and a player must know when it's worth it to spend their merchant tiles. The accumulation of corruption is inevitable; I'm not sure how strategic one can be about avoiding corruption.

RATING: N/A
First impression after one five-player game: Not sure this would hit the table again. I found the components cheesy, unattractive, and unnecessary. I thought the blind bidding had too powerful an impact on the game given how rarely it gets triggered. The game had too much downtime with not enough interaction. Also, the last player didn't get a final turn (with a full hand) after the fourth player built, which brought him from first place to fourth. Seems that the latter positions are at a disadvantage all throughout the game.The hand management - my favorite gaming mechanism - was pleasant enough, and the corruption element was probably the highlight of the design for me. Not sure in the long run that this would be enough to pull it to Thumbs Up; probably not though with the 90-minute playing time.

RATING: 7
I like this one quite a bit.  It really scores as a family game, because the game mechanics level the playing field really well.  In a bare bones strategy game head to head against my wife, I will win 90+% of the time, but not necessarily in this game.  There certainly is strategy and decision making, which keeps this game fun for me, but the best strategist at the table doesn't necessarily have a significant advantage over anyone else.  Next to cooperatives, games like this will always have a solid place in my home.

I think my favorite part of the game is building the mosaics atop the palace.  This appears to lend itself to strategic play more than than the rest of the building options.  After all, placing mosaics in such a way that will limit further placement and/or swing the end game scores.

Unfortunately, my wife has declared that she won't play this with me anymore...

The good news:

Gameplay is okay, but not very original (yep, another set collection game in disguise).

Simple card game with a lot of unnecessary rules and materials added. The card mixing mechanic is interesting and so is the corruption mechanic but one needs only one bad player to keep the tension out of the game. Probably a high scoring game in the category 'Price/quality'

RATING: 7.6
An easy game (a choice between one of two possible actions in each round) where there is only a little hand management to do.
Luck plays here a little part but the game also has some tactical details that grasp interest, along the thrill of never knowing what is the real status of each player due to the hidden money and corruption tokens (the later ones also working as a push-your-luck mechanism).
The game is indeed a bit visually overproduced, however, it´s really a feast to the eye and, by any means, a "bad" game, so it´s a nice bet to have as a family game or as a light euro, if you are in the mood for it.

I liked this game the first time I played it, and now I know why. I didn't *own* it. Now that I own the game, I can't get it back in the damned box after playing. This is a fun game, but I've found that the mosaics can really save your arse from getting fed to the croc...the sanctuaries are a bit overpowering in endgame play, but other than that, play is relatively balanced. I've been beat out by one turn to the heavier pieces [ie the throne and obelisks]and those seem to be a good chunk of change to earn. Overall a neat concept though.

This game works pretty well.

There's a card mechanic for gaining the resources needed to build. The trick is that you have to take an entire group of cards at once... but some cards are hidden and some cards produce extra resources but increase your corruption.

At the end of the game, the most corrupt player is fed to the crocodiles (and automatically loses regardless of his score).

This game is very enjoyable to play.  I wouldn't reduce the rating because it is "a card game with chrome" which was a common phrase at the Gathering.  The cost of the game might keep me from buying it, but the game itself was very interesting and pleasant.  I'm looking forward to playing it once my gamer friends pick up a copy.  Read my review to get a better understanding of the game play and the strategy involved.

Players are architects, straight out of the book Asterix and Cleopatra.  We're building a palace for her nose-ness, either drafting materials cards, or building a chunk of palace (and earning cash), during our turns.  Cards come in nice and really nice varieties, the really nice having a corruption cost.  Corruption hides in each player's piggy bank, to be revealed at the end of the game.  The player with the most corruption can't win (crocodile food, apparently) - bit like High Society and the cash.  Most cash amongst the remaining uneaten wins.  Works well, feels a lot like Blue Moon City in the "amass cards and build economically" genre.  Better than I expected.

Too complex for the very young. I bought it for my school agers but is a hit with my teenagers. The hidden tokens which can make or brake you seemed odd at first but really adds a bit of Fog of War to a competitive non-war game. Building things in 3D is fun and a nice twist.

(acquired in Larry's Great Moving Sale, Part 1)

Simple set collection game with loads of nice plastic models.  They're strictly unnecessary, but add to the flavor quite a bit.   There's some push your luck with deciding how much corruption you can afford and how much you think you'll be able to dump.   Cool that a player gets eaten, too.   There is literally nothing you can do when it isn't your turn, so downtime can be an issue with 5 players.   You either draw cards or play cards on your turn (Ticket To Ride?), so that makes it simple enough to work as a family game with slightly older kids.   It's possible that the Offering auction doesn't happen enough, so using 4 dice instead of 5 is an easy variant.

RATING: 8
I love this game, very glad I picked it up before it went out of print.  A resource building game that has cool components. One funny thing though, when people first see this game and all the components, they get scared and think it's overly complicated.  Then once you start playing most people pick it up pretty quick and realize how simple it is.  I like the speed of the game and the length too, I feel that they fit perfect to this game.  Have yet to find someone that didn't enjoy playing this game.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
What saves this from being a hopelessly boring card drafting game, is the corruption mechanism. Balancing points and corruption is what makes this game for me. The mosaic also adds an interesting side puzzle to the game. 

As such, I much prefer to play it with 3 players, because that way, VPs and corruption are equally important. With more and more players, the VPs become more and more important than the corruption, and without that balance between the two the game becomes more and more boring.

My wife and I played the official 2-Player variant of this game available on the Days Of Wonder website.  We really enjoyed it and will probably add it to our weekly lineup.  The great part for us is the 3-Dimensional building aspect.  It's just really nice to see your resources spent for tangible pieces of ... err, plastic.  Gives resource gathering a nice spin.

The only niggle I have with the game is the way in which resources are gathered.  Just seems a little on the dullish random side if I'm being totally honest.  Grab a pile, refill the pile, grab a pile ... hope for the best.  Other than that, it's loads of fun and we'll be playing it often.

I enjoy the theme of this game. The fact that you feed the most corrupt player to the crocs is a cool idea. The most corrupt player automatic losses the game, a bit like in High Society, even if you have the most points. Makes you think twice about what to do during your turn. The game is very beautiful. I enjoy the presentation. It's a set collecting game.

Drawing the rights cards the right turn is a factor when it's time to build things. It could easily decide when the game ends, and who wins the game. The mechanics of the game is ok. In Cleopatra, you use the game box just like in Niagara which is different from other games.

The game overall is enjoyable, but lacks variety on what to do during your turn. It's always the same thing every other turn.

Another Days of Wonder sleeper. This game is very unique, in that it introduces several non-standard mechanisms that are great fun to play with. The box-as-part-of-the-board, the hidden/visible drafting market, and the most corrupt player being sacrificed to the Crocodile God!

If that last one didn't grab you, the game is still loads of fun.

The game is visually appealing but as a light game, appears to be a little bit more fiddly than it should be. Hand sizes can stack up and with people trying to manage their cards and whatnot, downtime is noticeable for what is ostensibly a light game. There's also no real deep thinking to deciding what to build, i.e., an experience game more than anything else.

[3 plays] First time out, didn't like this as much as I had hoped to; seemed not very interactive.  Since then I have enjoyed it more and more (and the interaction in our last game was brutal!).  

This is a typically lavish Days of Wonder production, notable for clever use of the gamebox itself.  It's a light strategy game, with enough to it to be interesting for gamers, but simple enough to play as a family game. 

The only thing I don't like about the physical setup is the way that the walls don't actually connect to the doorframes, such that there's a space on either side of the doorway.  This tends to confuse people when thinking about the doorframe bonus.  The rules have some really good explanatory diagrams, though.  

I think the path to success here is moderation.  Don't be too corrupt, but don't be too honest.

Lots of components, but all blandly colored.  I enjoy world building with a 3d aspect, but in this game the build probably could have been done just as easily with cards.

The game was a race to build, but it was a little difficult to tell who was ahead, or which item would be the most advantageous build.  Strategy for this game will undoubtedly take a few plays to build, but the learning process for the game wasn't enjoyable enough to tempt me to try it again.  [Shrug]  I wouldn't actively avoid it, but didn't love it either.

I really enjoyed this set collection building game. The set collection aspect is really nice forcing you to take corruption if you wish to keep a very full hand of cards thus forcing you to build early and often.

The corruption mechanic itself is really nice as it is on many of the cards thus it is the ever present 'threat' that you have to manage, or blindly hope that one of your opponents is more corrupt that you at the end game.

I was surprised how quickly the game was over with a lot of the components being built very very quickly and we didn't even see the priest auction phase as the game was over so quickly.

And the board looks awesome once everything is built :)

I played poorly, I didn't get to build enough, I kept 2 of my merchants inside of capitalising on them, but I was totally safe from the croc. Lots of bits, nice game, the German text didn't bother us. There was nothing in the rules about the trompe l'oeuil cards, but we worked it out. My main gripe was as the 5th player of 5, whenever my turn came around, there was nothing in the marketplace worth getting. Long stalls or the good stuff was taken before my turn came around. I should have started with more than 3 cards...

Impressive 3-D molded bits help raise the fun to a seemingly average game.  The gameplay itself is fairly solid, but a bit too simple with minimal interaction.  I really like the corruption rule (i.e., Knizia's High Society) and the variety of methods players can use to dump their corruption points.  Still a decent family game, and Egyptian themes are soft spot for me.  Grade: C

This game is very hard to rate. It probably shouldn't be played more than a few times per year. But then it's great.
So if you have a large collection (meaning you always have a few different games you want to play), it's good.
In a small collection, it's probably not so good.

A gift from our 2008 Secret Santa.  We have a couple of [url=http://www.daysofwonder.com/cleopatra/en/content/variant/]two-player games[/url] under our belts now, and it's been fun both times.  Despite no feeding of the crocodiles, there's a lot of uncertainty towards the end, with at least one surprise victory.  It is better with three: in our one 3-player game, I was the one who got eaten, but I was nowhere near victory anyway.

Of course, the components are fantastic.  It certainly could have been done San Juan/Citadels-style, with everything represented by cards, but there's nothing wrong with enjoying over-the-top production once in a while.

Better than I expected: each turn you either gather resources or spend them. It's a very tactical game, but I liked the face-down cards and the corruption, which eliminates you High Society-style.

It's ridiculously overproduced; you actually build the palace with plastic pieces and the box.

I think I prefer Sobek, a card-only version of the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
One play. Looks good but the game felt like too many mechanics, none of which were really interesting to me.  I'd like it better if it were simpler, maybe without the rooftop grid thing.

The corruption elimination feature works fine but seems lifted from Struggle of Empires, where it's called 'unrest'.  Aside from the plastic bits, nothing in this game felt original.

I'm not even sure what I like best... it has so many unique features.  Use the box to make a two tiered board.  You must balance the efficiency of your building vs. the corruption you receive.  This may seem stupid, but the shuffling of the cards half face up, half face down blew me away.  And the bits.  Oh, the bits.  For a game with so much to it, experienced players can do a 5 player game in under 45 minutes.  We hate to put it away because it looks so groovy when you're done!

There is a lot of stress in this game, making it really enjoyable. Still, there are a couple of things that get it from rating higher: placing the mosaics is too fiddly, either you play sub-optimally or you take so much time that all your opponents will fall asleep; sudden-death means that some players will get one turn more than others, it makes quite a difference here since in a turn you can build AND discard tainted cards that hurt you at the end; there is a lot of small details easy to forget and you will constantly be checking your cheat sheet.

Nehezen tudom eldönteni, hogy pontosan hova pozicionálták ezt a játékot. Gémereknek túl random, party/családinak szerintem meg kicsit túl bonyolultak az építési kombinációk. 
Amúgy érdekes, egyedi darab, ha az ember felül tud emelkedni azon, hogy azért messze nincs teljes kontroll. A végén a korrupcióval kiesés különösen nehezen kalkulálható, Vegyes érzelmes: 6.7

A második játék után sokkal rosszabb a véleményem. Szerintem sajnos kicsit félrecsúszott az épületek ára és a lapok disztribúciója. Egyszerűen túl sok építészre van szükség ahhoz képest, mint amennyi a pakliban van, így leginkább ezeknek a megfelelő húzásáról szól a játék. A szerencse irreális és iszonyatosan bosszantó swinget visz játékba. Ráadásul ehhez képest marha bonyolultak az építési költségek, amiket állandóan skubizni kell emiatt.

This game is just Ticket To Ride with cool bits.  Really it is.  Think about it: on your turn you either draw cards or turn in a set to get points. There are a limited number of sets and they are worth different amounts of points. That's Ticket to Ride, my friend.

PRO - Components are great and really help get new players interested.  Game play seems a little confusing at first but after a few rounds it all makes sense and turns out to be quite simple.  It's pretty easy to get a feeling for when the game transitions to the end game.

CON - This game needs a plastic crocodile to menace the players as they take their turns.  Seriously.

I have wanted to play Cleopatra for awhile because I love 3D board games and also it is a modern game from notable modern designers. There is no argument that it looks great on the table and building the temple really does help commit to the theme, which is otherwise supported by card play. A sort of rather easy card drafting mechanic, which is a little random but with some hidden information adds a nice dose of push-your-luck. Considering your resource cards, workers, card effects, and things you could purchase and points you could make added a little too much AP for my liking when considering the rather simple design. Not a game that I would clamour for often but definitely a game that feels well-developed and not hiding behind its glorious components. Also, there are some scoring mechanics (floor tiles, building sanctuaries, taking corruption) which are smart and certainly products of fine designers.

My addiction got the better of me. I just had to have this one for the pieces. Besides, I have a friend who's son is an architect. As I played my second game, it became obvious it's a game of patience possibly. You can swing a lot more points if you hold out but don't hold out too long or someone else will build the parts of the castle you wanted to build. If you get too greedy then you're apt to get corrupted and will have to throw corruptions coins into your pyramid. Whomever has the most corruption coins in their pyramid at the end of the game gets fed to the lions (even if they got the most points), and loses the game. Someone else wins instead. Don't be greedy or get corrupted. Be patient and build small chunks, or hold out and build a big bunch in one fell swoop!

A fun light family game with strong "wow" factor, namely the 3D temple that looks cool at the end of the game. The most corrupt player will be fed to the alligators, but corruption lets you build faster, so the trick is how to be the second-most-corrupt player. Always don't mind a game or two of this one.

Surprisingly for a DOW game I was under impressed with the production quality but impressed with game play.  Although the sentiment wasn't shared amongst all players in my group I found Cleopatra to offer more depth than I would have ever considered before playing.  It may be a little early in the game's life cycle to claim whether there is any real longevity, but upon my intial playings there has always seemed to be obvious different approaches to achieving victory.  With such diversity in strategy (again only after a few plays) for a light to middle weight game, which does possess a bit of luck, I believe Cleopatra's rating and potential for longevity may rise.

Who doesn't like a game with so many parts to it? I love building Cleopatra's throne room and the obelisix's. 

The mechanics of the game works really well too. I like the concept of the corruption that you hide in your own little temple. Corruption helps you build more easily, but if you have the most corruption at the end of the game you're out.

Great family game! My 7 (almost 8yo) got it immediately. Very easy to teach. The theme is very well portrayed and my family all got into the game. The feeding of the "most corrupt" to the croc may be a bit harsh on a younger one. Build up your materials by collecting cards in the market. Use those materials (possibly combined with shady stuff) to build parts of the palace and collect money. Using shady materials and folks to help will get things built faster, but may cause your corruption to rise higher then your opponents. Recommend highly!

Ok I am a sucker for all things Egyptian, but even so I think this is a great game. Lots of choices on things to do, but not totally over-whelming. And when complete the game is a visual wonder. I can't wait to paint all the bits to make it even better. Being corrupt is all fun and games till you get fed to Cleopatra's alligator at end game. Eliminating you from winning even if you had the most points. This makes for a very nice balance of things during game play and makes for a very climatic ending.

Nice set-collecting family game, around the Ticket to Ride/Alhambra level.  Easy to explain and play, but with enough meat to keep gamers interested.  And has anyone commented on the great bits yet?  The High Society mechanism of eliminating the most corrupt player at game end keeps the tension on to the end. Jan 07 - the traditional missed rule - the Trompe d'oriel card can't be used to replace an artisan, only materials.

Her name is Cleo and she dances on the...  Whoops, sorry.  Good game, crazy production.  Your choices get more obvious as the game progresses, but I like the idea of corruption and getting rid of it.  I also love the idea of the player with the most corruption getting eliminated at the end.

I wonder how this game would be received without the all-out production.  In some ways it reminds of a review I read once on the musical of Phantom of the Opera.  The reviewer wrote that The Phantom of the Opera was like a can of cream of potato soup with an amazingly beautiful label.  It looks utterly fantastic, but inside, it's still just cream of potato soup.  I am not sure if this would apply to Cleopatra, but the thought has crossed my mind.  We shall see with further plays!

Update: Well, I think the game gets old pretty fast.  Your options are so limited at times, there is nothing to plan or think about between turns, and with bad card draws you are just plain sunk.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The game works fine, and is reasonably fun to play.  But the overproduction is actually somewhat irritating.  And make no mistake, it is completely gratuitous.  The big plastic pieces don't work together to make anything really cool, but just sit around separate from each other, taking up space.

As for the game, it's okay, but the lack of control is complete.  I wanted to try to play a corruption-free game to try it out as a strategy, but that simply is not an option.  You have practically no control over how many corruption counters you get.

Enjoyable family-weight game; better than expected after [-]two[/-] three plays.  There are some interesting hand management and timing decisions, the mixed face up/down deck is a nice new mechanism, and the corruption element gives the game some tension which might otherwise be lacking.  I'm suspicious of replay value, though, and wonder whether CatSoA will hit a hard ceiling after another couple plays.  That's at least better than Shadows over Camelot, which bottomed out halfway through the first play.  I'm of two minds about the production value.  I like everything except for the ridiculous strangely-junky large sand-colored plastic pieces.  Perhaps that's a bit like saying that I liked everything about Antarctica except for the cold weather.  Two-thirds of the board space is useless appendage, most hilariously displayed in the tacky sculpted plastic quarry that's nothing more than a reservoir for the unbuilt pieces.  So CatSoA is nothing I'm tempted to buy, but I'm currently enjoying it.  A word of advice: hoarding cards does you no good if you don't have artisans.

This rating may go down, but at present, I LOVE playing this game. I bought it because of the components. I was intrigued by the hidden/known information mechanisms. I enjoyed piecing together the palace. I was hooked by Corruption. This is simply the most fascinating and enjoyable single element in any of my games. Every time I play Cleopatra, there is plenty of banter about amassing corruption points.

My one big complaint: the game seems a bit short (which is odd for me to say). But it feels like it ends right when you are finally getting some work done on the palace. This feels less a problem with 3 players, and of course you can always play again!

The components are wonderful, but I didn't enjoy the game so much. There is too little interaction between players for my taste, and too much potential downtime. If one were think of Settlers and Catan and Las Vegas Showdown as possible "models" for this game, I would say that the former has a much more appealing board and the latter more meaningful tension and interaction through auctions.

There is randomness here. Sometimes you get lucky. I get many cards but also get many corruption tokens. This game is very lively. You are always busy with your cards, building. There are no moments when you have to wait for other players. I like this kind of game dynamic.

The game has a huge amount of chrome, but underlying that is a pretty good game. There can be a lot of down time in between your turns, so a game with fewer players is better. Works pretty well overall, but it didn't have anything that particularly grabbed me.

Very cool game to look at and simple to play - kind of a card set collection game. Either pick up cards on your turn or spend cards to build sections of the temple to make money. The corruption tokens make it more interesting though as you have to walk the fine line of taking plenty of them to gain the extra resources without ending up with the most at the end of the game.

Played a couple of times with 5 players. Nice looking game, with a couple of neat mechanisms - mixing face up/down cards and corruption. However for me it feels less strategic than Ticket to Ride and with less interaction (OK, so you may end up competing for the same structure, but even that didn't happen too often).

RATING: 7.5
Good family game, better than I expected, although I'm not sure if I like the rule about the most corrupt player being eaten by the crocodile. The luck factor seems to be high, especially in the blind bidding part (to get rid of corruption or take more of it). It may happen only once in a game but can be decisive. There is also luck in the cards, and maybe it would be better if they were all face up in the market. However, it's a well-designed game and everything seems to work. Components are great, of course, but one thing I hate about DoW is how they make miniatures in colors that make it so obvious that they MUST be painted. In this game, they are full of intricate details you can barely see.

So you grab the largest pile, hunt for some artisans, and then build whatever you can. Call me crazy, but I prefer games with actual choices. Sure, the corruption deal is vaguely interesting--it adds a superficial layer of press-your-luck to the proceedings--but it can't salvage what's a dull drafting game. 
In addition, for a game with no real choices, it's too bloody long. You manage this huge hand, try to make sense of the obtuse building requirements to see what you can build, and take forever placing the mosaic tiles *just so*. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This game is pretty good, I really enjoy all the building options and the corruption aspect.  Plus, my sister (who is not too keen on board games in general) thinks this game is great!  The only problem is that there isn't much long term strategy involved and you have little control over what happens.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Beautiful game with nice ideas. Luck may have a bit too strong influence, but I'm not sure about that, yet. Would need more back to back plays, instead of once per year. ;)

Away from the great components, it's the corruption mechanic that runs the game. The rest isn't really exciting, as you just collect cards to build stuff to get points. However, throwing the corruption into the game, makes it quite a different game that can stand on it's own.

Good game, where fun and theme meet some strategy.

Had wanted to try this for a while and must say I like the twisted mechanics of this one.  Our game came down to one player rushing his completion of two sections in order to fulfill the Game End objectives and hope it meant another player had more corruption.  Instead he got fed to crocs, but it's one of the delightful mechanics we've come to like about this game with friends.  We're much looking forward to more battles in the future as to whom is the greatest; and least corrupted.

Ticket to Ride with insane components and less interaction (yes it is possible).  The pieces for this game must be some of the most incredible bits ever stuck in a eurogame.  Its fun, but its a very light filler with very little meaty decision making and no real interaction to speak of.  If this game didn't have the incredible components, it would be universally panned.  I think it makes a good kids game though, and there are some clever ideas.  The push your luck element of the corruption tokens is pretty neat, and the hand management helps make the game slightly less mindless.

RATING: 2
Played now two times - unfortunately: the disappointing experience from the first round got confirmed. Felt played and found no interesting choices. There was never the question, whether to play more 'clean' or go the 'corruption-way' (something I expected after reading the advertisements), as this is nothing what you can really decide. And that is my key reason, why I don't enjoy this game.

The card draw mechanic sounds fun, makes no difference in play. Most of the times (depends a little on hand card limit, as this also causes corruption, to have to many cards) you take the row with the most cards. Not sure whether this idea would work better with other games - here it feels somehow "wasted" to me.

Rolling those 5 dice till we get 5 of a kind for sacrifices is also such a thrown in mechanic.

That is imho symptomatic for the whole game => Adding rules to a game is not an art - knowing what rules you can drop to make some game a better one is it.

And yes - please contact me and explain why the "it looks so nice" factor is so heavy weight in many other ratings. What "good looking" has to do with fun (in games!!!) - I don't get it.

I found the rules to be oddly laid out and some questions were not answered by them, though I found answers to all of them on BGG. The components are fantastic, really top notch. There are some mechanics here that are very different from any other game I have played and they work wonderfully well together. My main complaint is that it would be tough to play this one very seriously due to the fact that the talents and corruption are all trackable information and you would have a distinct advantage if you did so. Nevertheless, as a game with friends or family it is wonderfully easy to grasp, yet has a lot of depth to it. The amount of player interaction and the amount of randomness both really hit a sweet spot for me. Really looking forward to playing this one again.

[Initial Impression: 6] 
The best part about this game is trying to manage the corruption points you're willing to take on. The goal is use corruption efficiently, converting it into victory points, but to always take on just a little less corruption than one other person. Mismanage this and you'll be fed to the crocodiles! The rest of the game is a pretty standard hand-management and exchange engine, which I think gets fairly stale fairly quickly.

This game drips with theme, with its "Mouse Trap"-like construction of the temple elements. Build the more prominent aspects of the temple, get more VP. Although a set-collection game with cards, there are interesting choices to make, especially deciding when to take corruption to speed up your builds. Everyone is going to take corruption, but with each player's amount a secret, the push-your-luck aspect is a delight. Simple and accessible, it is a neat treat to have once in awhile. Rating: '7'.

RATING: 7
A mish-mash of mechanics (set collection cardplay, blind bidding, and a teensy bit of [i]Tetris[/i], among others) held together by an engaging theme and over-the-top production values.  It really shouldn't work, but when played as a lighter, almost party-style game (i.e., social above all) it works brilliantly.

Corruption is the fastest way to victory points—and into the crocodile's gullet!  For me the most engaging part of the game is the balance between greed (racing ahead via corruption) and trying to position yourself just enough to eke out a win.  You don't need to be the least corrupt or the richest to win—you just need to be one unit less corrupt than the worst player and a single Talent ahead of everyone who's left.  Really feels like walking a tightrope over a croc pit.

I hesitate to recommend it as YMMV, but around here it's worked great as a couples' game.

Excellent fun game, cool pieces (bumps the rating up from 7 to 8 on pieces alone).
A bit hard to teach since there are several *extra* things:  It's essentially a pick up cards and build stuff type of game - so that's easy enough to grasp.  Then you have to explain the sanctuaries - which is an extremely important and crucial part of the game.  Then there's the blind-bidding offering step - one new player bid $9!! and put himself way out of contention.

RATING: 7.5
Se trata de un buen juego. El objetivo es ser el más rico y, como mucho, el segundo más corrupto.. pues al arquitecto más corrupto se lo zampa un cocodrilo. Así, si quieres ganar, deberás correr riesgos (=corrupción) para adelantarte en la construcción y conseguir las mejores recompensas, pero sin perder de vista la corrupción que vas acumulando y la que llevan los demás.  
En cuanto a las mecánicas, hay cuatro:
1) Cartas. Se trata de un juego de cartas: las cartas facilitan materiales de construcción y personajes que otorgan privilegios a cambio de corrupción. Algunas cartas proporcionan más materiales pero suman corrupción también. 
2) Puzzle. Una parte importante del juego consiste en completar un mosaico que, además de dinero, elimina corrupción. Nuevamente, hay que saber adelantarse al resto y construir en el mosaico los santuarios mayores.
3) Subasta. Está es la parte más desconcertante. Conforme se construye, se lanzan unos dados que determinarán la obligación de hacer una ofrenda (=subasta a ciegas) al templo. El jugador más generoso perderá corrupción, mientras el resto sumará aún más.
4) Tienta tu suerte ("Push your luck"). Al menos, a mí me lo parece debido a que normalmente hay que andar por el filo de la navaja sin cortarse, es decir, acumulando la máxima cantidad de dinero sin ser el más corrupto. Como en todo momento la corrupción acumulada es secreta, el juego tiene emoción y diversión hasta el final. 

En resumen, un buen juego con bastante interacción indirecta y diversión. Buenos materiales, poco aire y una caja muy bien diseñada. Como pega, puede tener cierto AP, especialmente en la parte del mosaico, y es pesado de recoger.

RATING: 3
Over-produced game with a very high randomness factor, but it simply does not worth it. The stupid elimination mechanism makes you doing nothing but waiting for others to build, get corruption points and scrap themselves. The poor end of the game mechanism is somewhat emphasized by having no way to get an idea of the corruption level reached by the others. Thematic is quite good anyway and game components are top notch (like in others DoW games)
If you want a good game around the ancient-Egypt, try Amun Re. Cheaper and much more interesting.

Cleopatra took way too long to get everything back in the box such that the lid would shut all the way.  I dreaded having to put it all back together, and I wasn't enamored with the game, so it never got played.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
First played May 26th, 2010. Taught in 15+min, played in an hour with three players. It's all about resource management here. You build Cleopatra's building while gathering victory points along the way. Each player starts out with 5 VPs, 3 wild cards and a hand of three resource and character cards. The draw deck is shuffled and half the cards are shuffled in face down and the other is face up. The board is prepared for the construction on top of it. The top three cards are placed as puchase cards, however the orentation isn't changed. If they are face up or down, they stay that way. You your turn you may either take one of the three resource cards or build something with your resource cards. If you take resource cards you have a hand limit of 10. If you go over that you get one decay point per card and keep all of them OR you pay one decay point and discard down to 10 cards. Next you refil each of the three stacks of cards with the top most card, one at a time with one card per stack of your chosing. The resources are Artist, Wood, Marble, Stone, Gem. Some have two of the same resource on it, however they cost one decay. There are character cards that let you break the rules which cost decay as well. If you build an item, you play the resources, collect any decay points indicated from the card, collect VPs, and roll any remaing dice. Dice are 6 sided with one side indicating that an offering is due. All offering indications are placed aside until all 5 dice show an offering due. Each player bids their VPs on the offering and all lose these VPs. The winner loses two decay points and the 2nd place gets one decay and each sucessive player gets one more decay point. Cleo moves one space for each type of building being completed (spinx, gardens, etc). Game ends when Cleo reaches the 5th step of completion. The game moves pretty fast once every understands the options. I'd give this a try if you know someone who has it, however I don't know if I'd consider purchase.

Nov08: It's okay.  And that's pretty much damning with faint praise.  It's pretty much an inferior Ticket to Ride.  Your options are:

A. Draw cards.
B. Spend cards to build things.

Sound familiar?  The corruption angle is interesting, in that the most corrupt gets tossed to the crocs.  However, I found you only to have *some* control on how much corruption you take.  Also, the building choices were annoyingly meaningless.  We all built different things, some 3 at a time, some 1 at a time.  We all scored 12-17 points per build for the most part.  Our final scores were all withing 2 points of each other.

So thrilling...

Would probably work better in a family setting.  (Not necessarily a gateway game, if there is such a thing.)

Description: Collect resources and build parts of Cleopatra's palace.

Pro: Easy euro-style game. Great plastic bits build a pretty palace with the box. I-cut-you-pick mechanic getting resources. Piggy Bank of Evil rocks as both a game mechanic and a theme element (most evil points can't win). Half the cards being face-up in the deck is a great idea that adds a little hidden information. The theme matches the mechanics wonderfully. 

Con: Random cards can make it impossible to win. Some special cards are extremely powerful (although they force you to take evil points).

Admittedly, I have only played this twice, a 2P and 4P, but there is just something that I truly love about this game. This doesn't happen often with me.  I thought all the little pieces and tiles and stuff would be too much and complicate the game (but I still bought it cuz its pretty), but it plays simply and intuitively. I can honestly say my 7 year old was playing on her own after a few rounds.  She gave it a 10 herself.  With 4P, my husband and 12 year old got in on it. They HATE learning new games and grumbled, but afterwards said it was a good one and that they would surely play it again.    Some new games you play and when you're done you think, we'll have to give that one another try, some day.  With this game, I know it will come out again pretty fast.

Awesome production quality.  I think this is a good game to introduce to non-gamers.  Needs a crocodile token/piece to make it complete.  As such, I found an awesome little toy at a thrift store that I added to the game.
For fun, during the game we usually put it in front of the person that everyone thinks has the most corruption.  Great for laughs.
I will try to get around to adding a photo of the croc I found.

Game takes up a lot of room on the table but looks pretty nice and people get excited when they see all the bits. It's a pretty simple game. You either draw cards or build. What makes the game interesting is the corruption amulets. Whoever has the most corruption amulets at the end of the game automatically loses even if they had the most points. Most beginning players will try to stay away from getting any corruption what-so-ever. The usually end up losing. You have to carefully balance using corruption to your best advantage while not getting too much of it.

not bad - a little too much going on to explain to a non-gaming group. also, a little too long for a non-gaming group. i've played 2x - once as 2 player and once with 5. the 5 seemed to take forever and the other players (non-gamers) couldn't wait for it be over - although, at the end of the game, they did say they enjoyed it and liked the mechanics (despite the length)

RATING: 5
Nice diversion, but the card stack mechanic is a major luck element that can seriously impact the outcome.  In my one game, the player that got to draw 4 twice won handily...I suspect that would be true all the time.  Probably should be house ruled to prevent more than 3 cards from ever being in a stack.

I actually really like this game.  Yes, it is a light game.  Yes, it is a building/development game.  Yes, it is relatively obvious as to what moves you should make, as you try to outrace your opponents to build Cleopatra's Temple.  But you know what?  It's still a pretty cool game.

I don't think there's anything wrong with liking a non-broken game for its production value, and Cleopatra is a beautiful game, which really appeals to the new gamers.  It's a good introductory game, and while being a good game for younger players, will not bore adults to tears if played in moderation.

RATING: 6.5
TOTALLY overproduced.  All these plastic elements are completely unnecessary.

Decent mechanics and I really like the idea of corruption tokens and the rivalry to get rid of them through sanctuaries/paying with VPs, BUT the game is too family oriented for my current taste.  I used to like it more, but now I have a lower threshold of acceptance of family games and prefer heavier, meatier, gamer's games.

Sold.

Well lots has been said already so my comments will be short. 

BIG CHROME but no ENGINE, that's my short version. 

PROS:

 - Great bits of course
 - Nice family game even for kids
 - A little theme, very little
 - Gametime decent
 - Love the Croc aspect although it is pretty harsh but it adds some tension

CONS: 

 - BIG luck factor
 - NO Strategy
 - No interesting choices or decisions
 - No player interaction
 - Purely an optimization set-collecting game

Even though it's only a semi-blind card draw, there's still a luck of the draw factor which is why I can not currently rate this one higher.  In our 4 player game, 3 of us had the most corruption chits (just 2 chits each) so the 4th player won by default.  I look forward to trying it again now that I've got down the mechanics (which are relatively simple by the way).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This game looks much cooler than it is, because, unfortunately, the game is mostly collecting cards in hopes of getting the sets you want. Unfortunately, certain sets become useless as the game progresses, but you get punished for having many cards in your hand. This game needs to be reworked, because the idea of building up the palace while not being (too) corrupt is awesome, and the components—wow!

There is not a lot of player interaction.  This is a multiplayer solitaire game.  The timing (game over when 5/6 sections are done) and market card laying (half of the deck are face up) mechanisms are interesting.

Wow! This game is fun. It uses a unique deck mechanism of half the cards flipped face-up and shuffled into the rest that I've never seen before. Corruption gets things done faster but could cost you your life at game's end. The box art is fantastic and makes you want to play and paint up the great bits. DOW comes up with another winner, I want to play it again soon.

Some novel game mechanics can't make up for the lack of player interaction.  The 'corruption' makes for an interesting spin.  In my first game, I ended with the most victory points, but also the most corruption, so I automatically came in last.  It's definitely pretty, but I'm not sure if all of the plastic pieces are really necessary.  Fun for a couple of plays, but not a game that I'd like to add to my collection.

Great quality components and a clever board design make this a beautiful game to play.

I look forward to owning this game and painting the pieces.

I always describe this as Ticket to Ride with cooler components and a few twists that make the set collection and scoring a bit more interesting and a tad deeper. Certainly not a brain burner, but with all the components, I like that I can get the "feel" of a "fuller" game from about a half hour-45 minutes of play...although it annoys my girlfriend that the Shrine never gets fully completed =)

Beautiful bits, and that's about all that it has going for it.  I can see that some may like it, but I found it fairly random with few decisions.  Add in a blind bidding mechanism that can really screw you over, and it quickly becomes apparent that I am not the target audience for this game.

If there was only half as much game as there is toy in this box, we'd be onto something! The basic game is draft cards to build stuff, similar to Ticket to Ride in a way, except this game does not have the interactive board play which makes TtR a cut above in the family game category. Here, the decisions for what to build when follow an almost identical pattern game to game, destroying any replay value. The cost of corruption and the up/down shuffling method together don't add enough interest to overcome the lackluster building objectives you are forced to meet. My score already takes into account the superior production values.

The game components are complete and in excellent condition.

Small gameplay in a huge format. It's nice for occasional play but there's not much to discover for serious gamers that wouldn't be obvious after one game. If it wasn't for the absolutely outstanding components (once painted) this would be forgotten quickly. As it is, Kleopatra will likely see some more table time as an inoffensive passtime with non-gamer friends.

Another great looking DoW game. The gameplay is pretty straightforward; I'm not seeing a whole lot of choices to be made along the way. It's a very dolled-up set collection game in which the card draws might play too big of a role for me. I think that Ticket to Ride allows for more planning and hand management, which is more my style. Not bad.

My perception of the game may have been tainted by the general negative buzz on BGG, but I'm pretty sure I would have reached that conclusion on my own.  I don't really care that the game is overproduced (which it probably is), I don't necessarily care for all the plastic pieces, though I can see why it would really enhance the game for many.  At heart it is a very simple game that relies heavily on the draw of the cards.  I think there's some room for some skill in your hand management, especially in how you moderate the level of corruption you take.  I would play this again, but wouldn't suggest it.  I would also want it to play quick.  There's an optimal play one could make each turn, but I'd rather just have the pace of the game be quick.

Excellent! One of the games where the sum is greater than the parts! Nothing revolutionary, but all the different elements, card collection, building, bidding, sanctuaries and corruption handling, add up to a fun game. The game plays AND looks good! The special cards seem less desirable and useful in a 3 player game.
The 2 player variation at DoW´s site works okay! Unlike many other 3+ player games that are hard to scale down to 2 players.

A very light and fluffy card collection game with overdone bits. The components were incredible and really help sell the theme. Its easy to learn and play (especially with the included player aids), and I enjoyed this game very much. Its short play time means that it will probably see the table quite often.

RATING: 5
After all the hype surrounding it, Cleopatra and the boys fall short. Too many nice mechanisms have been pushed into the same box. There is a lot of stuff included in the box, but the components really aren't good looking; the game feels rather toyish. The gameplay isn't tense at all and the supposed "climax" comes in the scoring where you find that the play probably was quite even. The process leading to this climax isn't that great, however. It's also really hard to plan in advance which makes the game hugely prone to analysis paralysis. And on the corruption; you really have just a little choice on whether to play corrupted or not which I think is a little stupid. The game isn't bad, but doesn't seduce me to replay it.

Fantastically fun. I first played this back-to-back with Kramer's [i]Colosseum[/i] and, although it is probably not as refined in gameplay as that, it is truly a fun game. Looks fantastic; plays quickly; clever endgame; humourous gameplay; terrific components -- what's not to like.

A game of collecting resources to build things in order to earn money.

This would be even less interesting without the nice plastic sphinxes and obelisks.

The best part is laying down the mosaic pieces to try to make large areas.

Beautiful components and the rest does not work. The worst part is the endgame, because you depend too much on luck to get the right resources and cards in hand gives you corruption. So, if you can not build the last building it is better to get fewer cards and wait until the game ends.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Maybe it's a typical set collection game with a hefty random dose, but I darn well like it anyway! The auction to rid corruption is probably the least successfully implemented mechanic. The dice seem an unnecessarily random and off-theme addition (who not offer to the gods after each construction set is completed?) and the amounts bid vary wildly. There's also a fair bit of waiting. On the other hand, the gameplay is great, rules clear and setup/progression wonderful. For me a better gateway to teach and to have fun with than either Settlers or T2R.

A very interesting entry into the growing field of "collect material, build projects" games.  Particularly impressive is the way in which the game incorporates the box itself into the game.  Certainly Niagra achieved this feat even more impressively, but it ws still a nice touch.

RATING: 7
Nice bits.  Basically a set collection card game with some interesting twists.  The more powerful cards gain you corruption.  The player with the most corruption at the end of the game loses regardless of how many victory points they may have.  The trick is to use corruption to your advantage while accumulating less corruption than at least one other player.  The "offering to the Gods" is also a nice mechanic that reduces everyone's victory points.  A fun and interesting game.

Enjoyed this game, but the betting system was really terrible. You could strategize up to a certain extent, but then you had to figure out how worth your while it was to give up points for corruption. Although an interesting gameplay idea, it just led me to feeling like I'd overpaid to get rid of corruption--and it didn't even matter in the end, anyway.

Cleopatra and the Society of Architects is a fun and engaging family game that includes a true, three-dimensional palace that players compete to build. Players strive to become the wealthiest of Cleopatra’s architects by constructing the most magnificent and valuable parts of her palace.

Players, however, will be tempted to deal with shady characters and trade in materials of dubious origins in order to help them build faster. While these corrupt practices might allow an architect to stay a step ahead of the rest, they come with a high price – cursed Corruption Amulets honoring Sobek, the Crocodile-god. When Cleopatra finally strolls into her new palace, at the end of the game, the most corrupt architect (the one with the most amulets) will be seized and offered as a sacrifice to her sacred crocodile! Only then will the wealthiest architect, from among those still alive, be selected and declared the winner of the game.

RATING: 8
It's like a woman who is beautiful, but also smart.  Don't let the good looks fool you!  There's a good game beyond the pretty and with innovative & subtle mechanics.  A lavishly and beautifully produced game (top of the line DoW stuff) with very appealing theme of building & constructing a palace for Cleopatra, using card management (resources & artisans) as a major mechanism.  It has everything: cards, dice, big plastic bits, tiles/pentominoes, player aids, and on and on. There are several strategies to pursue and I suspect you'll find there's more than meets the eye after subsequent plays.  I love the end game rule where any player(s) with the most corruption tiles gets fed to the crocodiles and is ineligible to win (just like in Knizia's High Society).  Be careful how far you stray into the Dark Side...

My most stunning looking game, by far.  At heart a collecting card game with a neat twist.  The twist being at all stages in the game you need to choose between building more slowly or with more corruption.  The player with the most corruption will be eaten by the royal crocodiles and the richest surviving builder will triumph.

I really enjoy this game as it has enough to interest a gamer while remaining approachable for families and non-gamers.  The balancing of the relative value of corruption and victory points is the highlight.  I like the placement of mosaics, the closed fist offerings for sacrifice and the way in which the market piles are half-visible and half-concealed.  Very clever and beautifully designed game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
3-5 players.  Oh, yeah, fed to the crocodiles in my first play!  Made the mistake of only placing one mosaic in the early game and missed my chance to make a sanctuary while everybody else got good ones.  That mistake, coupled with getting caught with 5 corruption cards at the end, made me the most corrupt player by far!  The cool components help make this a much more enjoyable game than it would be with something simpler to represent the palace.  Would be happy to play this one again anytime.

Selo de qualidade: a esposa aprova!

Minha opinião: rs Que bom. O jogo não é complicado, e os componentes... Não tem nem o que dizer sobre eles, são ótimos. Você literalmente constrói um templo. Meu filho de dez anos conseguiu jogar e adorou (e eu que fui jogado aos crocodilos...). Boa diversão, não é nada que vai fundir sua cabeça.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
With one minor exception, this is a very easy game to pick up (the mosaic mechanic can be a bit confusing until a person sees it actually played out). Together with beautiful bits, it's a tremendous game to bring out with non-gamers.  With it's apparent demise (no indication that DoW will reprint), it may end up one of the gems in my collection.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
As expected, the game was lavishly overproduced.  The gameplay was fairly straightforward, although it did feel like the designers tried to mash together too many different mechanisms that didn't feel like they naturally gelled together---resource/set collection to buy the plastic components for points, the dice auction, shuffling the deck half face-up, and the spatial component of the mosaic of the gods.  However, probably the most interesting mechanism was the corruption track.  The game is rigged to give you corruption, through needing to use more powerful cards to even the simple act of discarding/going over your hand limit.  There's a nice tension to try and balance to avoiding corruption and using it to help you get more points.  I can see some more experienced gamers going into analysis paralysis or carefully tracking the each player's corruption total, which would make the game unbearable.  However, the atmosphere is clearly aimed at families as a fun game not to take too seriously.

I had mostly gotten it to help as a gateway game to introduce new friends to rather than necessarily as a two player game.  However, we did give the [url=http://www.daysofwonder.com/cleopatra/en/content/variant/]official two player variant[/url] a spin and were pleasantly surprised.  There are just a couple of adjustments to the cards, and more importantly the player with the most corruption doesn't automatically lose, but pays a stiff tax penalty, so there's still a balance between collecting corruption versus points.  She particularly loved it, and had a lot of fun watching me collect more and more corruption tokens.  I probably wouldn't buy it just to play with two people, but it works well enough to make it worth it if there's a chance to bring it out with more.

RATING: 4
This game's corruption mechanism is similar to Lord of Xidit's weird scoring. In Lord of Xidit I initially thought the scoring was fairly innovative in the need to balance multiple resources but after a while it felt kind of forced for unique mechanism's sake and too swingy and prone to group think. I think there is a similar problem here. It makes you have to value things differently but it the end not the most fun implementation. Also, while having the depth of a family game there are a lot of fiddly little rules going on, from the  card refill not just being automatic, bonus points for building, and rolling to see if there is a bidding for reduced corruption this round. Really great presentation though and the most cool box insert I've seen.

It's a hand/resource managment game at it's heart. It also has a nice bit of strategy in the mosaic aspect of the game. You also have to be very flexible, as often opponents will beat you to what you were just about to build. I also think that you have to be willing to eat a good deal of corruption. I have only lost one game out of 6 plays, and that is due to the fact that I came VERY close to having the most corruption. It's a fine line you must walk, but it will lead you directly to victory.

Good game, but GREAT production values.  When I take it out, yes, I want to compete in a game of it, but part of me just wants to *play* with all the stuff.  And I love games that include the box as part of the board.  And games where people get fed to crocodiles.  It's pretty much all hand management, which isn't my favorite mechanic, but the theme and the materials are so rich that I can forgive a lot, mechanic-wise.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
So this is a medium-light resource management game, cleverer and more intricate than, say, Mille Bornes, but simpler and more luck-based than, say, Puerto Rico. It also comes with a giant load of plastic bling. Anyone making a cursory inspection of the box will want to know whether the little sphinxes, palace walls, statues of Anubis etc. really add to the game.

My own answer is a definite yes - the rules very nicely integrate the business of constructing obelisks, putting up walls and placing mosaics into the flow of gameplay. The result is that, while you might not feel like an architect, you do feel like you're actually _doing_ something in your race against the other players here. It's fun stuff.

The "corruption" mechanism also strikes me as a moderately clever little wrinkle. This one's a definitely winner all 'round, and it's easy to learn and surprisingly cheap, too, given all that you get.

RATING: 6
OLDER COMMENTS: Not over-produced in my opinion... sure, pieces could have been made with flat card-board counters, but it's easier to see and experience in 3-D... at a glance, even without a glance, just from spacial memory, one is able to tell the status of each of the "types" of construction, something which I think would take more "work", if ever so slight, if it were a cheaply produced, flat cardboard affair.  Nice game, with many ways to win... feels almost as if Knizia designed it.

NEWER COMMENTS, THE BAD: After a few plays, I got bored with this game.  It feels too much like a mash of mechanics than a cohesive whole.  Excellent production quality in a game only matters if it makes the game more playable or enhances a theme that is tied together in the game's mechnics. These mechanics don't make me feel like I'm in Ancient Egypt.  And for me, this is another game that show that while there is some good graphic design in Days of Wonder's games, the figurative illustrations are failry bad, and usually copy known movie stills... how else do you explain the presence of Liz Taylor in this game? 

NEW COMMENTS, THE GOOD: Nice specialty dice, the player colors are refreshing and easy to distinguish for the color blind like me, and the crocodile mechanic is excellent.

Overall, I think I'd play it again, but I no longer had the desire to continue owning it, sold at Unity Games XV convention.

Excellent components and fun game play. I love the taint mechanism. Taking taint often allows you to do more beneficial plays but the person who has the most at the end of the game is eaten by a crocodile before calculating their score. Recently the price has gone down to 20$ which is a complete steal.

There are lots of finely produced bits in this title. The game seems pretty short with the building pieces going very quickly; often at least one person builds 2 each round. 

It can be difficult to draft the resources you need reliably and that can conceivably halt your efforts with the game being this short. Otherwise a good game just not incredibly exciting though trying to get rid of your corruption is always interesting.

The most gorgeously produced game if ever there was one, almost to the point of excess. The tray that holds the palace components while not in use is moulded to look like a quarry!

As pointed out by others, this is very similar to Ticket to Ride without the rails.  A light set collection game, easy to teach, easy to learn, easy to play, reasonable length (perhaps a little longer than it should be given the simplicity of the game).  Very little interaction, almost MPS in some parts.  Fun and interesting, with good components, but nothing new.   The twist is that one can accelerate the scoring of victory points by taking the risk that at the end he/she will be eliminated.  While novel it is still a game of math.  I enjoyed playing it and I would play it again, but will probably not favor or prioritize it over other games, although it is an excellent replacement for Ticket to Ride type games.

[Played 8 times]
Simple rules, yet the gameplay is not devoid of some tactical decisions. 
Hand management and optimization of your choices are both present, even if in a simple form. However, luck is crucial.
Some rules seem thrown in just to add something different, and thus feel a bit out of place (the "tetris game" of the Mosaics, the trading phase of the Envoys, the blind bidding to the High Priest).
Gorgeous tridimensional bits.
Fast paced once you're familiar with the building costs.
Overall, I think it is perfect for its intended market (families and casual players); not bad, but very light, for gamers (an overproduced filler).

I think I like this game more with each play.  It's not easy trying to be the first to build the big point sections of the temple while trying not to become too corrupt.  It's very easy to gain corruption and it's something you need to be conscious of.  Then to throw the whole game into a loop, they add the offering of the gods.  How much money are you willing to spend?  If you offer the most, you lose corruption, otherwise you'll be adding even more into your pyramid.  This is right around the edge of my top 10.

RATING: 8
A highly underrated game. Both in BGG and in my group as well. I was unlucky enough to buy this after TTR-Europe. By that time everybody in the group was stuck with TTR.

The two games have similar mechanics. But the additional corruption points mechanic makes Cleopatra much more challenging. It also removes much of the TTR luck factor.

My complain on this game is that despite that the game components are of excellent quality, it is impossible to neatly repackage and store them in the original box. I use two additional boxes, one for money and one for corruption amulets, for properly storing the game.

RATING: 8
This game is wonderfully produced, and more fun to play because of it, and the theme is right up my alley.  It's a tad lucky and almost too chaotic.  However, it is quite fun and i can never quite predict who is going to win.  Building a plastic Egyptian palace draws child-like joy out of even the most serious of gamers.  Also the threat of corruption and hidden VP's add an element of terse danger.

RATING: 7
Playing this with the correct rules regarding die rolls (after every build step, not just when the exalted Queen of all Egypt gracefully moves closer to her throne) made my initial impression from a couple of years ago even more positive. In our session, the one auction for betterment of our corrupted souls occurred relatively late and led to a nail-biting finish, where the winner and runner-up ended with four crocodily stains on their professional reputations, and I and another loser got fed to the crocodiles with five corruption chits. Which was all the more grating, because I managed to burn ten (ten!) of the nasty things thanks to my mad mosaic tile skillz, but that did not impress Sebek’s brood.

If there is one thing that keeps this very good game from being great, it’s probably the playing time, which is just a bit too long for what it offers. I can’t see how to move things faster without wrecking the finely tuned balance, however, so this will remain another offering from Days of Wonder that I’m happy to play but not keen to buy for myself.

Released on my birthday, it was another week before I was finally able to cajole the wife into letting me purchase it (walk softly, carry an armful of roses...).  The rules are fairly simple, and game play is faster once players know what they have to do each turn.  It can slow down quite a bit, and player interaction is almost nil.  Still, it is a good game in both play and aesthetic appeal.  It will see repeat play, but probably won't displace Shadows over Camelot as our group favorite.

I wasn't expecting this to be as good as it is. I was simply drawn to the components, but the gameplay is quite intriguing as well. The market "shuffle" (there's a press your luck element as you don't know everything you're buying--some cards are face up and some face down...interesting) mechanic and the corruption mechanism are quite intriguing and add some interesting choices to an otherwise pedestrian resource management game. The components, of course, are awesome!

Gameplay is simple and the rules are easy to learn.  Downtime can be a problem with new players, but after a game or two everything flows smoothly.  I like the mini-game of placing mosaics and the many options you have of building parts of the temple.  The corruption amulets add a lot of tension to the game and it's always exciting to find out who is going to be crocodile chow.  All in all, a nice mix of luck and strategy, but most of all a ton of fun.

A really good game.  Set collection of resources to enable building to score points.  Corruption points which threaten take the most corrupt player out the game introduce a really interesting element -  how far down the dark side will I go in order to build the things I want?  Enjoyed the mix of face up and face down resources, and the interaction of the different character cards.  A lot to like about this game.  Very well presented and a great use fo the box.

Fun game that evokes some nice atmosphere mostly due to the corruption rather than the bits.  Can feel a bit long for what it is with younger players, but the awesome bits offset that some.

RATING: 7
I'd been looking forward to playing this game for a while, and it definitely didn't disappoint on my expectations.  Thanks to Days of Wonder, this is a beautiful looking game, which makes it quite fun to see the palace built up in front of you.  It's not the most strategic game, and there's a good amount of luck in it, but there's plenty of decisions and trade-offs to be considered, with just enough player interaction to keep everyone involved without becoming cutthroat.  The hidden corruption tokens also help to keep the tension high throughout the game, providing a great balance between cost-vs-reward.  I'd liken it to Ticket to Ride in terms of strategic depth and the overall feel of the game, which means I won't often play it as a serious game, but it would often come out with newer players and as an excellent change of pace.

Game in a Nutshell: Draft cards and use them to make combinations for building pieces of the palace. Some cards and actions have a corruption penalty that need to be watched because the most corrupt player loses automatically.

Played as: 5 player

Pros: Simple rule set makes the game an easy one to explain and play almost in the time it takes to set up the board. Ambitious board add a nice visual punch.

Cons: There was a big part of this game where I felt it was in a way just playing itself out. You'd more or less get what you got, build with them what you could, and take the corruption that comes along with them. The card part was especially random and with no real mechanic to mitigate a poor hand, decisions almost felt forced upon me. 

Other: This is just impressions after one game and I'm sure there's more subtleties to it then I realized. Still it felt like a game and weight of something that would be perfectly suited for 30 minutes border-line filler. As it stands I have a hard time realizing its niche.

Best Use: May still be good with a slightly gateway crowd.

The game is pretty simple - take cards or use cards in different combinations to build things for points - but the twist of managing your 'corruption' makes the game something else entirely. I enjoyed it, but I found the downtime between turns just a little long. It's a bit of a puzzle to work out what you can do, but it's an interesting puzzle. The whole production is of course gorgeous and hugely overproduced

Pro: Visually appealing, great production value, same weight category as Ticket to Ride
Cons: Way too difficult to acquire the ressources necessary to build something (especially when items start running out and some ressources become useless). Lots of downtime, very little interaction between players (and basically no way of preventing a player to do this or that. Basically multiplayer solitaire. Knizia-esque scoring could confuse newbies/light game players very easily. I like the use of corruption points, but it's a mechanism that's been seen in a ton of games before. The card-stack building mechanism could be kinda fun (although that's also been seen before) if you could figure out what the other players are looking for, but unless you have an awesome memory you're just basically more or less trying to build stacks that may or may not be of any appeal to the next player. Neat idea for the offering, but odds should have been calculated such that it would happen more frequently (3-4 times a game would have been best, as it stands I think the odds are about 0-2 per game)
Verdict: feels a lot like a "by the numbers" game, nothing new, nothing especially interesting, and thus overall kinda bland and disapointing.

Medium to medium-light Euro with an interesting plastic twist: many, many plastic components (as well as a bunch of cardboard pieces to boot).  Collect cards in hand a la Ticket To Ride and use cards to pay for building components which add victory points.  Several moving pieces, but the understanding comes fairly easily.  Like the 'corruption' idea, as it's a race to get the least -- but I can see that the mechanic of immediately eliminating the most-corrupt person could be a downer.  Even though, if that happens to you, you might not be playing right.

I got Cleopatra a while back when I was starting to buy games (it's been all downhill from there;)). I'll be honest with you the whole reason why I bought the game was that it was insanely discounted for a Days of Wonder Game and I thought I'd take a risk on it. I was not disappointed. I really thought that this was a game that oozed theme and was engrossing but also solid mechanically. When I bring this to the table, after the game there is ALWAYS a discussion of "I thought you were more corrupt!" or "I was going to build that next turn!". After playing other games I see a lot of very familiar mechanics, but the corruption and the sheer production value makes this a game that I always recommend to friends and one that I believe is the best bang for your buck game you can get out there.

I liked this one though I don't much care for the "player with most corruption loses" mechanic.

Even discarding becomes quite strategic. Most of the game is quite good.

This is a fun game of resource management and set collection.  The 3D board adds something really cool to the game - by the end of it, I feel like I've accomplished something.  The collection of corruption counters adds a nice "gotcha" to the endgame - you just never know how many will cost you the game (as the player with the most is a flat-out loser, but the rest of the players suffer no ill effects).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Hard to see how this can stand up to repeated play. Basically, you just collect as many cards as you can as quickly as possible and then build whatever three items you can. Waiting to get the cards for "better" builds costs corruption, and most of the things you can build seem balanced enough in scoring that it probably doesn't matter what you build. You have very little control over what cards you get, and it seems like just getting more cards and making the best of them is better than getting one specific card for the "perfect" build.

The corruption mechanism adds an interesting tension, but I felt it was undermined by the arbitrary sacrifice mechanism. Occurring only once in our game (which I hear is typical), you have very little bearing for how much you should bid, yet in our game it ended up being the deciding factor.

To its credit, the components and layout of the game look fantastic, just inspiring you to want to play. I could be talked into trying this again, but I can't see what I'd do differently. It just seems like the game kind of plays you by feeding you cards that formulate what you build. You do it, and then wait around while everyone else fiddles with their cards and placing the mosaic tiles.

There are not many games in my collection I can think of with such beautiful components! Gameplay is very smooth too, mainly geared towards set collection for building the parts of the palace. The corruption tokens add a nice element to the game, trying to get as many points as possible but without pushing it too far to be fed to the crocodiles! Love it!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Super fun. It starts off a tad slow, but once all the gears get in motion, it picks up and makes for a very close game. It does have a lot of luck, of course, with card drawing, but you can try to plan somewhat to overcome it and build things. I also like how it forces you to take corruption at the end so it helps you realize that you can't ever avoid it completely, so players [like me] are less likely to try and avoid it and will just play the game to the fullest extent. I do hate that one player, when scoring, is automatically out, but it also makes sense thematically so I can let it slide. Really enjoyable. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

RATING: 6
A euro-style building game with very nice production value. Gather a resource combo and use it well - that's what the game basically revolves around. There are, however, a few details which make it stand out in my opinion. First of all, the way scoring has been devised makes a player think twice before committing their resources - that's because many things one can build interact with others, triggering combos and various multipliers. The other thing is the corruption mechanic - it introduces a nice "risk vs reward" aspect and adds a whole new layer to the experience. All in all, a very well produced and interesting game, even though I am not a huge fan of eurogames which mainly involve buidling and boring crap like that ;)

The players are trying to build key sections of Cleopatra's Temple Complex to curry her favour. You can get ahead at the expense of corruption but if you have the most at games end your time in the sun is over. Nice mechanics, takes a few plays to learn how to 'work the system'. Nice but DoW's best. Great visuals although shame some of the pieces look so bland in colour.

Not a classic DOW game for me - and i'm a massive DOW fan.  Although containing some amazing components, it's not that great a game really.  With the limted amount of time i have to play games, there are quite a few i'd put ahead of this one.  Having said that, it's stil one to be pulled out about twice a year. :)

On a side note, it's tediuos as hell to put everything back in the box for this one!

This is a fun game of balance. You balance taking corruption against making more powerful moves to build before other players. You also balance resources and the number of cards in your hand. The game has charming simplicity that makes it accessible to almost anyone. And, of course, building things is fun! Particularly in this game with the outstanding components. The last and perhaps one of the most captivating elements is not having any idea who is going to win until the end. If someone seems like a run away leader with talents, they likely will have the most corruption and will be eliminated from winning.

I wonder if I'll ever get the chance to play this.  I bought it to play with another couple who enjoyed some of my "designer games" but they are now divorced.

Update: Fast forward five years to 2011 and I finally got a chance to play this game with my wife another couple.  This was our friend's first euro-style game and we all had a good time.  It was easy to teach and presented enough options to keep everyone interested.  There were even a few "take that!" moments when someone's plan was foiled.

Update: Fast forward to 2016. I haven't got a chance to play it since my first play in 2011 so it's on the trade pile.

Not the best game but one we really enjoy.  Got it on the cheap.  This one has more plays than a lot of other games in my collection.  

Just watch out for corruption...it will really do you in at the end of the game if you're not careful.

The fact that the person with the most corruption gets fed to the crocs is just too rich!  

Very fun.

Ok, I'm a sucker for Days of Wonder games.  This is beautiful game which is fun to play and I won my first game!!  Lots of new and unique mechanisms in this game, like the deck of face up/face down cards for resources.  I like the resource collection and building theme.  The corruption tokens and sacrifices to the gods work well for balance.  Try to be second most corrupt to win.  Or hope all other players tie with most corruption then you win and the crocodiles eat ALL of them....that happened in my first game!!Great stuff.  May upgrade after further play.  

Decent gateway game helps rating for me as I now have a great game I can take to a friends house of non-gamers and wow them and they can actually get into the game!!

Gorgerous components is nice but game is just mediocre.
It seems to have everything as some people say (card, dice, bits, auction etc), but it seems like it got nothing at all.

It is too long for what it is. Figuring out to maximize the area with mosic tiles are disaster. It totally reminds me of Princes of Florence except this one is worse.

Also there are too many obvious decisions such as never build single dog, take the largest pile when drafting cards, better build at least 2. Nothing is really hard.

The way of using dice was lame, auction was rather lame.

The most interesting part is probably the card draw mechanic, which makes you shuffle cards both face up and down at the same time so that you can see some of the cards. Other than that, it felt somewhat like an extended/advanced version of Coloretto/Ticket To Ride with downtime longer than I would like. Seems overproduced to me.

Light on rules, but not necessarily game play.  It can be a bit of a burner attempting to wrap your head around the different combinations of resources used to build the palace, but beyond that, game play is very simple.  The game is absolutely beautiful and it really is quite fun to build the palace as the game goes on.  The real genius of the game, and without it, it would be dry is: corruption.  The corruption element of the game is just sheer fun!  You very carefully have to weigh the amount of corruption you take in the game compared to the amount of stuff you want to build.  There is where the tension, and thus the fun, of where the game lies.

Very aesthetically pleasing.  Maybe the pieces were functionally unnecessary but it adds a beauty and touch to the theme of the game that is doubtlessly a plus.  The game itself is pretty fun and quite simple.  Goes faster than what you would think.

Update:  But there are more strategic, fun games that play for a lesser period of time that don't have to deal with a bunch of game pieces that exist purely to make the game look bigger and nicer.  

It is still interesting to have that "corrupted" factor, where the more corrupted player gets eaten by the crocs, thus automatically losing the game.  It is better implemented than Livingstone's.  But then again, it is a variant of player elimination and I don't want to find out that I spent all that time to simply not matter at the end.

RATING: 6
A fun set-collection game where all players are building a large structure.  The physical pieces that you are allowed to place on the structure as you build it makes it that much more fun.

During the game you are trying to collect sets of cards that will allow you to build parts of the structure that will score you points.  Your choices become a bit more varied with the addition of the evil-mechanic.  

Every time you want to push your turn further you take these evil tokens that allow you to do more with your turn.  Be careful with these tokens though, because the person with the most of them automatically loses the game, and the person with the least amount of them probably did not do as much as the people with more tokens.

Beautiful components make this game one of the best gateway games. Its low price compared to the pieces you get is one of the best bang for the buck games out there. In addition to that, corruption makes this game fun.

Qualms: Gameplay is too simple with its extensive rules, it will be more interesting if there are more options instead of either going to the quarry or the market, maybe allows one to mess with other players instead.

An immersive game where you do feel like you building a palace. Lots of choices, many with consequences. A neat combination of press-your-luck, resource management, and almost a "racing" mechanic.

As well, the mosaic construction feels like a game-inside-the game, bringing in an interesting metagame.

La prima cosa che salta all'occhio in questo gioco è la componentistica con sfingi e obelischi: plasticosa e eccessiva, ma sicuramente efficace. Il regolamento non è immediato e ci sono numerose idee alternative, nel complesso comunque il gioco è semplice, bastano un paio di turni per scaldare i motori. L'interazione è presente e costringe a volte gli avversari a cambiare programmi. La negatività più evidente è il tempo di attesa tra un turno e l'altro, specie se giocato in cinque. La durata di una partita non è particolarmente lunga, anche se la prima partita può richiedere molto più tempo.

I'm still on the fence a little about this one: the Taint cards almost pre-determine the winner, and the requisite avoidance of said tainted goods is almost a bore. The little Tetris subgame of playing with the mosaics is cute, though, and the 3D pieces are OK, even if they're not all that special. My first candidate for a paint job.

I like the game play and the limited resources and choices.  It just seems a bit much for setting up and take down with all those pieces.  For the scoring, rather than the player with the most corruption loses it would be better to just subtract corruption from score (with some bonus/penalty for being first/last in corruption).  The death penalty seems a bit severe.

I have to admit that the components for this game go a long way toward adding to the enjoyment of playing, but the game design is solid, it's intriguing to play, and it moves along.

It does, however, take quite a bit of time to play, plus, there is plenty to think about as players make or choose to not make moves, knowing all along that the most corrupt player is going to get fed to the crocodiles and therefore isn't going to have a chance to win the game when the value of all other players' building success is totaled. 

The rule I like the best is the one in which you split the deck in half, face up or down, and shuffle the cards as such to create a draw deck. Three cards are placed out at a time, each face up or down, which introduces elements of luck, risk, and strategy. But above all, choice. 

In addition, Days of Wonder provides its usual beautifully illustrated and clearly written rule book (plus a code by which owners of the game can play online), and the company has yet another winner. Once you get a handle on game play (it's rated for age 10+) it's not difficult at all. 

Purchased Fall 2007. Sold February 2014.

Game is fun enough, a simple sort of resource collection game to build up the different parts of a temple.  The pieces are pretty bland and boring to look at, and the game has a cluttered feel.  I do like the tainted mechanic, where being all but last is okay, so trying to make the most of taking negative coins.  Something about it just does not stick for me, and while I do not dislike the game, I would never pick it out to play.  It is too simple of a premise wrapped in too long of a game.

RATING: 6
A game of too many parrot loving pieces trying to disguise the fact that there's not much play going around. Pick up a pile of resource cards (3 piles to choose from) for a few turns in a row. Get VPs by then building as many buildings on a turn as you can with the cards (searching for bonuses). Start picking up cards again. Playing the more powerful cards give you corruption points, and in a High Society twist, most corruption by definition must lose. In the other twist, half the cards you choose are face down, so this is the lottery that'll drive what you end up building. Turns alternate between quick pick-ups, and then slow-slow builds whilst people work out their best scoring option with 10 cards and maybe 2 or 3 things to build. It was neat, it worked, no major flaws. Just unexciting, not much opportunity for anything but tactical play and it's unevenly paced.

Arrived on 26th JAN 2012! Happy! Played it now for the first time and as expected it turned out to be a superb game! This is part of what I believe to be the aureate 1st generation games of Days of Wonder, when they did super games with super quality components. Now, since Mystery Express, the quality of their game components has decreased... games are still great I'm sure, but I did feel somewhat disappointed.

Cleopatra though is awesome fun, light game with high risk factor and a neat sort of game where you always try to keep track of things hoping that your opponents are doing worse than you on the corruption department.

Components are just some of the best I've seen, it looks great as you build stuff! Great light-hearted fun.

- Rule book is excellent, rules are easily understood and explained, plays fast and fun.

This is a gorgeous game.  But some would dismiss the game play as a result.  After my first play, I found this to be an excellent gateway game - very approachable.  The simple rules allow for a rather quick explanation, yet the manner in which you have options for each play provides tons of decision-making and different approaches.  It can be a very tactical game as well and you can change your strategy based on teh cards you can lay your hands on and how much corruption you are willing to take.  I actually expect this to climb a bit with additional play.

Card collection game, where you are saving up for pieces to Cleopatra's temple. Some cards  give you bonus goods, but with a price of corruption tokens, which are saved in piggybank style pyramids. The person with the most corruption is thrown to the crocodiles and unable to count up their veeps.

I waver between a 6 and a 7.  There are a lot of mechanics meshed together into one game.  Some are logical, like collecting cards (supplies) and spending them on buildings.  There are nice limits set on card hoarding, and the corruption points are a nice limiting mechanism.  Still, it's hard to know what is needed to build each piece, and each player, being limited in his cards anyway, just tries to save up to buy three of them (or at least two), and works to get the 2 and 5 point bonuses.  There is a bit of strategy in laying the Mosaics and going for points or corruption deductions, which I enjoyed.  Also, we never did the "lose corruption points auction" because we never rolled that 5th ankh. There are a lot of clever bits, and a lot of decisions to make, but I felt like I won out of luck, certainly not through any advanced planning of my own - which is kind of minimal anyway, and the turns were either too slow or overwhelming to follow.  Rating based on one play.

RATING: 6
Unique boardgame design and typical DoW component quality made it fun to play this one. However, I felt that the game allowed for too much analysis paralysis in selecting which "market stall" of cards to add to one's hand. The initial play required approx. 2 hours, a little too long I thought. And the "tainted" resources and characters seemed to be a little too pasted on (surely there wasn't that much corruption going on!). So just so so after all is said and done. But I did like the game ending twist that required the architect with most corruption to be devoured by the crocs...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Nice looking game, which has very simple mechanics and a good degree of luck on how cards are drawn and obtained. The corruption mechanics added to the priest bid mechanic make for several interesting tension stages through the game. I would think this would be a good introductory game for most people, as the luck factor balances out things. The visual/physical elements of the game look like something that would draw people to play the game.

Appealing theme & clever way of using the box & components to build a structure during the game.

Interesting scoring options give you plenty to think about, and there appears to be a reasonable choice of tactics available, depending on the cards you draw.

WARNING: Game can drag a little if players don't plan their moves while other players take their turns.

Decent components, except for the sticky underside of the board that holds all the plastic building parts (I solved the problem by attaching some sticky-backed plastic book-covering material).

NOTE: Official 2 player rules are available, and appear to work quite well.

RATING: 7
Pretty pretty pretty. Very nice eye candy. The risk factor of the game is the best part, as you have to balance tempting powers and the fact that the most corrupt person loses no matter what their score is. It's also amazing to build such a cool looking temple. Paiting this game is a must.

Older title from Days of Wonder. Nice production quality as you might expect. I liked the game play since it is pretty straight forward. Set collection with some luck and take that involved.

Good game, but excellent bits don't a great game make. And without quite  a bit of painting the bits are only good. The distribution of the Artisans, which are required in multiples for almost everything, seem to control the game which adds to much of a luck element. The best part of the game is the mosaic, which has the most 'common' bits. I felt the other bits actually detracted from the game. And the decisions as to what to build were nearly automatic. Very little tension as whatever Corruption is gained is usually necessary and unavoidable.

RATING: 8
The first "Days of Wonder" game I purchased and undoubtedly the most visually stunning game in my collection.

In this game, players are architects who gain money from Cleopatra by building her palace (yes, there is a 3D palace in this game). In order to outmaneuver your opponents, you have to judiciously use substandard building material and/or gain the help of corrupt game characters. However, each time you do so, you gain a corruption point.

The twist in the game is that at the end, the most corrupt player is thrown to Cleopatra's crocodiles and is not eligible to win, no matter how rich. The way to win this game is to be the second-most corrupt of all players and richest among the remaining players (after the most corrupt has been eliminated)!

Very much like the balance between positive VP's and negative (Corruption). To get the most points you want to do multiple builds but to do so requires you also take negative points.
Like the multitier building with different costs for each (walls, courtyard mosaics). All in all you have quite a few choices.
The drafting deck with the combination of up versus down cards leads to some extra decisions late in the game when you are trying to avoid corruption

Pretty fun to play too! Object of the game is to get as rich as possible, by building parts of Cleopatra's palace. But be careful! You won't get there by being fair to the others, so you'll need to be a bit corrupt. Too much corruption, however, and the Queen will feed you to her crocodiles!

I finally got to play Cleopatra!  The conclusion?  This is a very well-balanced, well designed game that requires some strategic thinking.  Overall, it was fun to play...maybe just a bit dry.  Player interaction is minimal and because it is a game where you are constantly reviewing resources, you do sense the lack of player interaction.  But there is a quite a bit of player "dependency" that makes up for it.  The components coming out of the box are a problem.  But once you taken them out and have played, there are fairly easy to re-store in the box.  The box being a part of the game cuases some sightline issues on a rectangular table.  Themeing is terrfic.  First-rate.  I liked it better than I thought I would...primarily because it was so well balanced.

Gorgeous game - not too heavy, but still strategic and competetive. The combination of mechanics is the best I've yet played - set collection, hidden/public info, auction, spatial puzzle, character cards with special abilities, corruption management as well as Coloretto-style row selection and screwing other players with card placement-  they threw everything and the kitchen sink in here [b]and it WORKS![/b]
Slightly heavier than Ticket to Ride and Settlers -  great for non-gamers who want to take the next step. Components are fantastic, and theme is a real winner in our group. Balancing the desire for the correct mix of resources, with the need to build your set (without taking too much corruption) before the other people build the last building you were planning on can be agonizing.
This game is underrated on the Geek. I feel people dismiss the fantastic components [i]that are actually used in the gameplay[/i] (even the box-top!), and the unique balance between points and corruption, as well as the face-up/face-down cards which provide some known information, some hidden.

I played this once, and it was alright. I liked the varrying market piles, but I couldn't grasp the building strategy. It was a game of 6 people, and I think that only 2 of them had played it before, and they were able to build properly. I like DOW games, and the mechanics for this are good, but I don't think that it's a game for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Not too bad, I like the mechanic of the person with the highest 'corruption' (presumably to score higher) getting eliminated before the winner is determined.  The variable powers of the cards also adds interest to the game, as does being allowed to select which pile of cards you get (some known, some unknown), and the limit on hand size.  The scoring system, and the means of limiting corruption are also all very interesting mechanics, making the game interesting and strategically complex.  However it somehow feels 'lacking' since your choices of what you can do and can't do each turn always boil down to what cards you hold meaning you can pick 0, 1, 2, very rarely 3 things, and you almost always want to choose to do what scores the most points (which is almost always fairly obvious).  If there was some way for you to have 100 choices each turn, and no clearly best one, this game would be very much improved, and could still make use of all those great game mechanics to be a great game.

This game is fun enough, but it is pretty much a classic example of a game that pretends to offer you more choices than it really does.  There are some really great ideas in here--the corruption, the offerings, but unfortunately the execution of these ideas in the game is lacking. Since what cards you play is the direct product of what cards you are able to draw, there isn't a lot of tension or choice when it comes time to build, which was really disappointing given how much the this particular mechanic has been hyped. And it is a good idea, but just executed very poorly in this game.   

Also, the points for building different items is a little wonky. As others have stated, there's no reason not to build two sphinxes, if you plan or can build any at all. Likewise, nobody is going to build the doors until somebody can build a few walls along with them. At any rate, the game is fun enough, and the ridiculous overproduction adds to the fun, at least for me, anyway. I wouldn't suggest this game, but I wouldn't turn it down either, at least not at this point. I can see the replayability of this title being pretty low, but I haven't gotten there yet.   

update: down to a five. meh.

Pretty ok, I thought the 3D pieces etc. were a bit too much since the setup took quite some time. I actually think this would have been better looking with regular tile pieces that you just lay on a skeleton of a building. The card draw mechanics and balancing between getting something built and getting the cards you need felt a bit random. One player saw only one artisan during the match and had to take loads of corruption to even build something. Still, that's only one game, rating might change.

It's a giant toy!  The components are ridiculously awesome, but I think the toy like aspect of the components definitely matches the theme and the lightness of the game play.
 
This game can only be fun if no one is taking it too seriously.  I like that it's goofy, that strategy can and should be employed.  But the mechanic that makes this game is the corruption.  I love that it's an evil mechanic but not one that is aggressive towards others.  It's something you use to give yourself a temporary advantage while possibly giving yourself a future disadvantage. 

Cleopatra and the Society of Architects has a lot of cool stuff going for it for a light filler game.

One of the best produced games I have seen, a magnificent board plus great pieces and artwork. Players draw cards to gain resources and build components of the palace. The most critical rule relates to corruption amulets, which are easy to gain and difficult to lose (via a blind bidding mechanism) -- the player who has the most corruption at the end of the game automatically loses.

Very pretty-looking game, and quite interesting to play too. You don't know precisely which cards you're taking, as some are face down, and you have to balance cards which you need for building and those which will make you more corrupt (because the most corrupt player at the end of the game is knocked out before points are added up). This is really quite fun as a light and occasional game - and it's also pretty tense, with the auctions to avoid/gain more corruption (you lose your bid, no matter where you come) being really quite fraught, in a good way.

Lets see. One of my favorite games. Wonderfully made, pieces and board, wow. 

New and interesting mechanics I havent seen anywhere else. The alligator-coin auto-loss is a wonderful mechanic for 3+ person games: whoever does the most 'evil' loses before final scores are counted up- regardless of their score.

Oh and the Tetris-like pieces in the Garden have like this little mini game thing going on that I haven't seen other games do. That could be a game of its own- and yet it takes a back seat here. Beutiful and fun and interesting- always trying to build the best gardens on the second board- to save you from the crocodiles, lol.

The ankh dice mechanic is cool too, even though it is secondary to the rest of the gameplay: Each time someone builds something they roll these 5 d6s. Each d6 has 5 blank sides and an ankh on the last side. If an ankh comes up on any of the dice, you set it aside permanently.

Then, next time you build something, you roll the rest of the dice. Players keep doing this, setting the ankhs aside until all 5 dice have become ankhs- which triggers an event. Then they are 'reset'. I liked it.

The box is used as part of the board too! The cards are well made, the tetris-like tiles are So Gorgeous, just wow!

The brown anhk dice are really neat, the pyramid coin-holders are clever and cool, and the aligator coins are fun. 

The money is the kind used in Illuminati!, but bigger and easier to handle. The plastic statue pieces are fun and pretty durable.

All in all, this is a Very Tactile game!

I gave it an 8 because it has 2 problems.

1) mechanics issues- it is very hard to win 'on purpose' so-to-say, and really hard to tell who is winning. 

Kind of like, you each feel like you should be the winner. You each work hard, do a good job, and feel as if you really earned a victory. But then poof, someone else got it.

2) Somewhat limited re-playability. If you have played 5 games of this 2-player, you probably wont want to play for a year or so. I would play it 3 or 4 player again, but you get burned out on the 2 player version after like 2 games. 

Still, I would not sell or trade this game- part of our permanent collection.

Other than those things, I love this game, it is what hooked me on Days Of Wonder games. The attention to detail and high quality of pieces was astounding.

At its core this is just a set collection game.  There is some player interaction with the various character cards and the possibility of screwing an opponent by building something they were hoping to build before they get the chance to.  I personally would like a little more player interaction and the chance to mess with your opponents' plans, but that will not be an issue with all players.  That being said, it's basically a simple set collection game with a few extra bells and whistles and a good amount of visual appeal, therefore it is a very good gateway game.

Aside from the wonderful bits and clever use of the box, there wasn't a ton here that outright excited me.  Several of the special cards seemed unbalanced, and I'm not sure the game really benefits from the hidden information in the face-down cards.  I won't object to playing again occasionally.

Scoring system works beautifully in this game. Plus the way the game plays and looks is just simply amazing. But I don't think there's much of a replayable game here. First game went well, so I'll see if it can stand up to a few more plays.

Edit: The game is gone from my collection. It just didn't offer much of anything different from other games. It did have it's differences, but there wasn't much to make me want to play it much.

I was expecting very little from this one as I had heard people rip it apart. We played it with a bunch of nongamers and it was a lot of fun. It's not rocket science, but its fun, there are a few interesting choices, and the hidden corruption is fun. I also think the production value of the game adds something to it. The added production value also helps with nongamers.

--May2006-- A whole lot more fun than I had been lead to believe from the early reviews.  It seems to be part of the same family as Ticket to Ride and Showmanager - both of which I find quite acceptable.  The blind bidding seems to be a relatively isolated occurrence, and adds to the amusement of the game (in my opinion) rather than detracting.
--Jul2008-- Yet it's not been played for a while, either.  I'm beginning to think that (with the exception of Ticket to Ride) the Days of Wonder oeuvre are things that play themselves out after 5-10 games.

RATING: 6
For me this is an O.K. set collection game.  I admit that the bits push it over the top for me and rid me of any buyers remorse.  I liked that the game moved quickly, but it didn't feel like there were a lot of options to choose from each turn.  I liked the idea of the corrupt goods and services, but I felt like there could have been more interaction among players.  Playing corrupt cards (namely personalities) never really felt like it was worth the corruption.  I would have liked to see 'personality' cards that functioned in a similar way, but didn't initiate corruption, or instead...  maybe cost Talent points.
Over all a nice quick game, and one that may see some more table time.

Enjoyed my first game, in spite being eaten.  Follow-up games were much better as all four of us had a better handle on how many corruption tokens are too many, and how many points were enough to win.  A nice balanced game with more than a few ways to get into the winner's circle.

Much more fun than I ever would have guessed.  I've played a few of times now and enjoyed each play.  Initial (before playing) impression was that it was a bunch of shiny bits posing as a game, but now I see that it's better than many new games.  Especially interesting in the "most corrupted player loses" rule.  
With all this said, it is still very luck dependant and not a game that I'll actively seek, but I won't turn it down either.

The production quality is top notch and there's some good ideas in there with the card facing during the card drafting. Four players might be the sweet spot with this one - I think five is just a little too chaotic with a little too much downtime. Worth exploring further if I can get past having to pack away all those pieces again. Probably the biggest factor in this not rating higher is that it's too simple. In terms of exploring the game further there's probably not much more in it past a couple of plays. That's not always a bad thing, but after the effort put into the pieces I'd hoped for something a little more rewarding during play.

I didn't give a dime about this game and it was a very pleasant surprise when some friends made me try it.  It is a fun and over produced in the good way set collection card game with a very good mechanic about taking corruption tokens to perform special actions.  Players score victory points out of making different card combinatios, nevertheless the one who has more corruption is out of the run for winning.

I was a little uncertain about this game at first, because it has a LOT of pieces. But, like most Days of Wonder games, the pieces add to the experience. I found this game to be a pleasant mix of European style gaming and good ol' American overindulgence. 

Plus, the mechanic of having the most corrupt player get killed at the end of the game encourages you to play dirty, but not TOO dirty.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
3-4 player construction game with awesome production quality and 2 cool mechanisms: the half-up, half-down draw deck, and corruption.

The obvious comparison of this game is with High Society (most corrupt player loses immediately), but I feel the game most closely resembles a souped-up version of Ticket to Ride with a cleverly enforced hand limit. Very fun game in the right mood, and the wonderful, overproduced components really add to the enjoyment and visual aplomb. This is a classic case of great components making the game fun to play. Very strong press-your-luck component in here.

There's very nearly a really good game in here, but it's stuck in no-man's land between gateway games and more complicated games. If you want gateway, Ticket to Ride is faster and much easier to teach. If you want complicated strategy, Cleopatra is way too chaotic, and the player interaction is awkward. My main beef with this is that the mosaics and the Envoy card add way too much complexity and uninteresting spatial decisions to the game, preventing this from being an awesome gateway game. The game is visually spectacular on the outside, and you'll attract many curious stares, but the design (due to the mosaics and awkward player interaction) is inelegant.

I wouldn't dare to play this with 5 players, as AP players can really slow the game down when they visit the Quarry. I think 4 players would be an interesting way to play the game (due to Offerings and end-game scoring), but I hope it doesn't make the game appreciably longer than the 90-120 minutes I've experienced with 3-player games. 3-player is theoretically elegant, because you're trying to finish 2nd in two arenas: VPs and corruption.

It's really strange that this game feels decidedly average, in spite of having two very cool features (the half-down half-up deck and corruption), and arguably the most amazing bits and value for money in a board game. This one nearly achieved greatness; the parts just didn't add up.

Cleopatra and the Society of Architects -- Played once; four-player.  

I found it difficult to remember which combinations of resources were required to purchase the various commodities.  The summary cards did not alleviate the difficulty.  In Settlers of Catan, I never had any such difficulty.  At first I assumed this was because Settlers has fewer combinations, but in fact Cleopatra has only one more combination than Settlers.  No, I think the difficulty arises out of less intuitive combinations and out of the varied numbers of cards required in each combination.  I expect that even with repeated playing, I will continue to have to refer to the summary card to determine my available actions.

Also, the gorgeous bits are nothing but window dressing.  I was disappointed that many of the pieces serve only to mark the passage of time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
I liked it, but it's not that memorable despite being really cute. 

In short it's a Ticket to Ride alternative from DoW: a set collecting game (specific sets that you turn over to build pieces of palace to get VPs). The toy/game is very gorgeous looking, the gameplay very similar to TtR, but without end game scoring (TtR's tickets) and neat dramaturgy of TtR. Instead there's more screwage in form of corruption tokens. The most corrupted person(s) is thrown to the crocodiles, from the rest the one with most money wins. But sometimes you spend too much money for auction to get rid of corruption. 

In the end this is a fun family type game. The only reason I don't rate it higher is that the gameplay seems to me very similar to TtR (as far as mechanics go) and that one is way better. Still, a good effort. Would rate it higher if I had kids/teenagers. And it's not a WP game, so there's that. 

But if you like TtR and look for something similar, look no further (forget Thurn & Taxis, that thing is a bore, here's where the fun is).

EDIT: now after time has passed this game figures in my mind as a visually appealing TTR "clone". It's just so similar to TTR in my mind, and yet not distinct enough. I have no idea why I would play this. It's not a bad game, but... just get the better option which is TTR. 

Rating down to 1.0 - why does this exist? A TTR copy, but bland-ish.

Fun little cardgame with beautiful plumage. This game is essentially an almagamation of several mechanics seen in other games (set collection of Settlers, rummy like drawing of card, Kniza-esque elimination of player with most corruption, Amun-re blind bidding effects, etc).

But boy is it fun. There are several risks to take in the form of corruption as well as drawing face down cards. The race to build something before an opponent creates a sense of palpable tension. The artwork and components are gorgeous and although there's nothing original in the mechanics, it all meshes together very well.

Worth a look.

*** Note for trade info: My copy is painted! ***

What I would really like for this game is an expansion featuring some new cards and maybe even a few new pieces or elements to worry about (such as another area with new mosiac tiles, or a tournament ring for challenging other players... maybe even something based on matching hieroglyphic symbols to gain more talents or deplete corruption tokens). The game could use some sabotage elements. Like all of Days of Wonder's games, this is a very fun game with outstanding graphics. However, it can't be played too often since the strategy isn't deep enough. You find yourself going through the motions and making decisions, but not really challenged.... with that said, it is fun. And fun is good.

RATING: 5
This is surprisingly better than I expected, which as you can tell by my 5.5 rating wasn't much.  There isn't a whole lot new here, but there is enough of an amalgam of different games with some new spices to make this game feel somewhat individual.  Of course the pieces help.  

For a card drafting resource management game this seems to offer some decisions. Although, I think that you are just going to try to draw the most cards that you can and spend your cards on the items that will give you the most points based on what you drew. This includes cards that give you corruption.

There isn't really much of a choice in how you get corruption, only in how you get rid of it. As far as building stuff, well you just kind of do what your cards allow you to do.  Strangely, the weird mosaic mini game/puzzle is the most compelling part of the system. Unfortunately the mosaic has the most depth and thus feels disjointed as it dramatically slows the game down. It ends up standing out as something that works against the design rather than for it.

I'm not seeing a whole lot of depth here, but it is enjoyable enough for a light family game once.  I can't see playing this multiple times unless you bought this without trying it first.  Were I to play this again I suspect my rating would go down...

If you can get past the fact that you're paying a bit extra for some flashy pieces and you don't go into it expecting something really deep and strategic it's actually a lot of fun. After playing Ticket to Ride 1000 times I actually like this better now (partially because it's something new). I especially like the mosiac laying / walls / front door aspect of it. I managed to lay the tiles down in a way that forms a massive sanctuary in my last game that was really rewarding. It's like Settlers, Ticket to Ride, Coloretto and Blokus all together with some fantastic looking game pieces.

I like feeding the most corrupt player to the crocs, the cool bits, and the deck shuffling mechanism.

I do not like that the game mechanics are boring. Choices are threadbare: build or draw from one of three piles. It is never tough deciding what to build, what to draw, or whether to gain corruption or not. There is very little player interaction, and this is from someone who defends the player interaction in Princes of Florence! Watching the palace develop is not as cool as I thought it would be; just place the same pieces in the same places everytime.

Cleopatra is a simplistic set collecting game with a few tacked on elements that feel contrived and which do nothing to improving the heart of the game.

I realize that Cleopatra is supposed to be a light family game, but gameplay is simply not engaging or fun, even for light families.

RATING: 7
Wow, what a good-looking game! Once the game is well underway, I almost dare you not to stop and be attracted by the components if you were passing by at a convention or the like. The easy-to-pick up mechanics of the game are also a draw to players. We were able to get underway very quickly, and almost never had to refer to the rulebook thanks to the great reference cards. There can be downtime when it's not your turn, as other players can't do anything while you're going (luckily turns aren't too long). Also a small problem was it seemed like building some of the higher value pieces early on is a huge boost for those players clever enough to construct them (making it difficult for others to catch up). All-in-all, the Egyptian theme shines through and you really feel like you're building a temple for Cleopatra.

I really like Cleopatra not just for the amazing components (best I've seen in a game this size), but also for the different mechanics present and the way they are carried out.

While Cleopatra has a lot of bits to go with the game, they are all very well made. It's a lot of fun seeing Cleopatra's palace erected bit by bit.

Quite a few people in our gaming group like, and so do I, even if I manage to get frequently eaten by the crocodile at the end. ;)

I love the game board.  I used to think it was more of a novalty before seeing the Niagra board, the oldschool Dixit insert...  I don't know much about this game's gameplay, but I still like the way that it looks.  Hoping to get it as a part of a trade.

The new game from Days of Wonder is just a beautiful thing! You use the box bottom to represent the palace, and play tiles on top (the garden). There are a bunch of plastic pieces (sphinxes, obelisks, columns, a throne) that look good, too. Game play is pretty easy: on your turn, you either go to the market (3 stacks of cards) and take a stack (then add to all 3 stacks from the draw pile), or go to the quarry to build piece(s). Building earns you gold, with bonuses from building 2 or 3 structures at once (most gold wins). The cards are mostly building materials, as well as special cards that allow additional actions. The different pieces require different combinations of material (cards) to build. Many cards are marked with an alligator  - using those earns you corruption points (kept hidden in a paper pyramid like in Tutenkamen). Whoever has the most corruption at the end cannot win. There's a nice mechanism with the draw stack: half the cards are face up before shuffling, so you have some knowledge about what's in the market, but not complete knowledge ... important because corruption cards in hand at games' end (when all pieces of 5 out of 6 types of pieces have been built) DO add to your corruption total.

It's a pretty good game and I had fun playing it, but it seemed like there was a lot of luck related to the card drawing. An OK game for a gamer family, but not one I'd likely play very much ... go with Shadows Over Camelot!

This always looked like a meaty, complicated game to me, but it's not difficult at all to learn.  The game looks very attractive.  Beneath the surface, I like the corruption point feature as well as the deck shuffling, and the decisions are mildly interesting, but there's just not enough tension here to make it a great game.  I wouldn't want to play this with AP types.

RATING: 5
I don't see any fun in this game.  For me, the lack of variety in the building resouces bogs the game down, especially towards the end when you've only got a couple of items to choose from to build.  You can have a whole hand of cards and not be able to build anything or have a good choice of how to use your turn.  It becomes a waiting game to see who can finally get the one or two necessary cards they need to finish the game.

What most distinguishes this from other building games is the physical, tangible representation. plastic pieces are arranged and, turn by turn, the grand temple is completed. The scene looks impressive and is a gauge of game progression. I've appreciated it more as i've played it more, but it's not likely to be a favourite.

RATING: 9
I love everything about this game.  First off, the visuals of actually building the temple are not only revolutionary, they are gorgeous.  The game play is simple, yet elegant.  And I absolutely love the mechanic of the corruption which means the person with the highest points at the end of the game is not always the winner.  Great game, and one that I wish Days of Wonder would re-print.

Of course, any game this overproduced can't be any good right? Well, sort of. Cleopatra is nice to play and all, but in the end, the game play can't stand up to the looks. A decent family game in a very snazzing jacket. Nothing more, nothing less.

Days of Wonder have really out-done themselves this time!  In this game, you are not pretending to build a palace for Cleopatra - you really ARE building a lovely 3-D palace for her!  I don't think I have ever seen so much game in such a small box.  So sure, Cleopatra looks gorgeous on the outside, but does she have any depth to her?  I was initially impressed by the various elements that make up the game play (especially the delicious twist of corruption and crocodile food!), however with more plays my enthusiasm has cooled like a desert night.  I keep reaching the end of games utterly convinced that I have won, only to find out that multiple players have managed to obtain slightly more money than myself (although we have had a lot of very close games).  And it's the unpredictability of the card draw and the hidden information of the other players' corruption and money levels that can lead to some frustration.  I have reluctantly come to accept that it is essentially just a card game (I strongly dislike most card games), with the strategy consisting of having to figure out how to best manage the hands that you are dealt.  But that being said, it is still good for a fun time and I've even had some success playing this with non-gamers.  Game design: 4.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 3/5  Total: 7.5/10

RATING: 4
In the second game of this I played, I was seriously unable to accomplish *anything* simply because I couldn't get the necessary Artisan cards.  You can't build *anything* without an Artisan card, and some builds require multiple.  A total of three Artisan cards passed through my hand while the other players were spending dozens.  (True, I was given three chits at the beginning of the game allowing me to sacrifice 3 VP each to use as an Artisan, and I did have recourse to those.)  Lots of interesting stuff happening in here, but if the real crux of the game is whether you draw Artisans or not, it's pretty disappointing.

RATING: 7
This game is very enjoyable for me.  I tend to like lighter gateway games and this one fits squarely in that category.  As many state, the board and bits are really cool and add to the game atmosphere.  The rules are very easy to learn so the game has lots of non-gamer appeal.  Even with the simple rules there is some strategy lurking in this game.  I particularly  like that one of the palace sections will not be completed before the game ends.  This makes for some long-term planning when making building decisions.  I also like that you can eliminate some corruption with careful mosaic placement in the garden.  The corruption issue at game end can make things very tense which is a good thing.  Some complain this game is not engaging enough, which I can see if you tend to enjoy heavier games.  Others complain the game has too much luck with card draw.  There is some truth to this but there are "wild" cards to help get around supply shortages, so I don't think the luck factor is bad.  Overall I think this game is quite fun and recommend it to anybody who likes lighter games that are non-gamer friendly.

Nothing special about the game mechanics here.  Another rummy variant from Days of Wonder.  Get cards, time it correctly to get the right ones and pick the best stuff to build.  It seemed like game basically played itself for me, and though I won, I didn't feel in any way like I outplayed the other four guys.  Great components, but not much to the game.

[2 plays] Initial reaction rating.  This game does look cool.  The building theme and bits are both big plusses in this game.  I have the same complaint about this game as I do in Ticket to Ride.  To much of the game is spent just drawing cards and drawing card some more until you finally get the ones you need to actually do something.  Then immediately you go back to drawing cards some more.  What saves this game into being a 7.0 rather than 6 or 6.5 for me in addition to the bits and theme is that corruption mechanic.  That is just a cool idea that makes this game stand out a bit.  The person with the most corruption is out of the game at the end, yet you need to build up corruption to be competitive in the points.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I really wanted to like this game, and as it is I don't dislike it, but I see no need to own it or play it often. I didn't find the components "beautiful" as others have commented. The main issue is there is too much luck of the draw for cards, which gets frustrating. Not much interaction among players; everyone is just trying to build their own stuff. The dice rolling is just silly. Positive stuff: the corruption element is a great idea, the mosaic tile laying is appealing without overwhelming the main game (similar to Princes of Florence), and the element of card piles that are half face-up, half face-down is cool.

in the foot foot library. owned by Funpaul. I like the interaction of the mechanics at work in this one. At first I thought "another Days of Wonder rummy game" but there is enough other stuff going on that it turns into quite a bit more than just rummy. Looking forward to more plays. After a second play this game has already soured itself for me. I mean ya know it's just alright for me dawg. Collect cards build something, rinse repeat, takes too long to play it, not much more to it than rummy.

RATING: 7
The bits in this game are fantastic - worthy of at least a 9; but the game itself is at best a 7.  I like a lot of the mechanics, particularly how the order that things are built can so dramatically affect their value and how you can do more if you're willing to take corruption to do it.  What I didn't like was how much the luck of the card draw affected what you could do.  I also didn't much care for the offering mechanic with the dice because it seemed like the frequency of the offerings is too low and too random (our first game didn't even _HAVE_ an offering).  Some of the cards seem unbalanced. And my final complaint: while the iconography on the cards is functional and attractive, all of the icons look very similar at a glance.  They're all nearly the same color and, being a tiny hieroglyphic inside a small cartouche, they're difficult to distinguish without taking a close look.  Stronger color coding would have helped.  As it is, it's difficult to tell at a glance what things in the quarry you can afford and this tended to slow our game down as people had to carefully look over their hands to plan their move.  That would likely improve with repeated play and more familiarity with the game.

RATING: 3
Pick up cards. Pick up more cards. If you can spend some, then do so. Once or twice a game a real decision is necessary, but its only a fleeting moment.

After a few plays I gave it away, but the recipient had to promise to never bring it to our regular sessions.

Argh... nearly 4 years since my last play, someone brought it along to a session and I fell for it. I'm getting old. My memory is failing me. Why didn't I simply dive across the table, wrestle the game out of his hands and eat it (piece by piece) to prevent me having to play it. I must try that strategy next time.

tl;dr: solid euro

This game has been out for 10 years now, and I finally got around to playing it for the first time. Pfew, finally off [geeklist=154286]the list[/geeklist] :)
The basics of this game are pretty standard euro fair: get cards and use the resources on those to build different things. The different things require different combinations of those resources and score you points in different ways.
There are 2 twists in this game: half of the cards in the draw pile are face up, half are face down, which adds some nice tension if you really need something specific. The other twist is of course the corruption you get for doing certain things. And the player with the most corruption loses automatically. Luckily there are ways to get rid of some corruption at end game scoring.
It plays well, there are some nice choices to be made, the production is quite nice (a ton of plastic, I would have preferred wood) and it's playtime is very appropriate. Solid

Initial rating: 6.7/10

The more I play this, the more I enjoy it.  Subsequent plays have improved my rating of this game. It moves fast, and as long as you are prepared to take the corruption (but then play mosaics carefully later to get rid of it) you are not quite as driven by the cards as I first thought. The ability for you to chose which pile to place the next set of cards is a clever idea also, allowing you to create future stacks that are good for you, but not so good for other players.  Far from being the gimmick I thought they were at first, the stunning components really add to the atmosphere and theme of this game. Enjoyable, opulent, and tense.

As others have commented the game is quite beautiful and the gameplay was also fun.  My biggest hurdle is trying to figure out how to lay it on the table as the bulk of the gameplay involves the cards but you really want the centerpiece to be the board.  This however means players are having to reach at the cards in an out of the way location and since that is the bulk of play it is a pain.  I will probably end up moving the board to the end of the table and having someone in charge of building the palace at the instruction of the purchaser of the items.  Otherwise our first game out of the gate went well and we will be pulling it out again soon.

This review is rather after the fact, when we played over a month ago it was a 5 player game.  I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it, despite a hideous loss.  I was glad I finally got a chance to try it, the marketing drew me in right away, that and it being a product from one of my favorite companies.  I really enjoyed the play despite a horrible loss and constant screw job due to income.  Despite this I really felt the game was fairly fair and even, the corruption element is excellent for maintaining balance.  The game is a constant balancing act, money, corruption and luck.  At its core its strategic and competitive yet it remains very approachable to everyone.  I really like the unique card mechanism, having half the deck flipped face-up and shuffled into the rest really adds an interesting dimension.  The really awesome thing about the game is the production quality and building pieces, they really catch your eye and generate interest.  Granted the mechanics could be done with tiles or something just as effectively but WHY when you have the ability to really make the game an eyecatcher.  This game is great for gamers who aren't heavy hobbyists as the rules are easy to grasp, play is exciting and the components really give a sense of completion.  Great for any collection.

RATING: 6
The kinetic gaining and building with pieces in this game is great. There are several puzzle-ways to win different parts. There is a means to fudge the results and consequences of that action (sometimes it helps but if you gain too many discs at the end you can loose...sometimes you get discs no matter what you do so there is a luck element here). 

I don't know. There's enough going for this low-to-medium weight filler/family game that you'd think I'd like it more. Maybe another play or two.

RATING: 7.5
Very fun game with some occasional good decisions to be made. The one strategy that seems to work is to take the market with the most cards since it is fairly easy to get rid of corruption. It is a fairly light game, but all the rules are sometimes a turn off to newbies. Only played 4- and 5-player, which seem to work equally well, but 4-player is more tactical.

Cleopatra is an overly busy set collection game with a few novel twists, but we wouldn't be having this conversation if it weren't for the gigantic plastic pieces.  Actually, flipping half the deck over before shuffling is a brilliant idea, and so is the guaranteed loss for anyone with the most corruption points.  But they don't add up to enough.  This is a good spectacle game where newbies can't resist the chrome. Without the shiny shiny, this would drop a point.

I like the corruption mechanic- you can play cards that are extra helpful, but they come at a cost: you have to put corruption tokens into your secret bank. At the end of the game, the person with the most corruption gets eliminated and can't win, no matter how many points they got. The other players then total up their points and see who won.

The rest of the game, though, is pretty boring and random.

The most interesting mechanic of this game is how the *most* corrupt player gets eaten by the crocodiles, so there is a strong incentive to be 'second' most corrupt.

That said, I find it has too many physical pieces for what is essentially a card-management game, and plays too slowly for what it is.

Very simple game with great components! I can say that trying to get it all back in the box is a pain in the @ss. I will use this game if i want to draw in non-gamers to play. For that reason it deserves a high ranking although personally i think that it's a little to simple for my taste.

One of the few DoW games I said I MUST try be fore I buy.  It looked like the company might have stepped out into the zone of focusing on cool looking components and not so much on game play.  How wrong could I have been?  This game stands up to exactly what I've expected from DoW. Quality game that is easy to learn and a lot o fun to play.  Seems to be several strategies that can be taken to victory given the choices of your opponents.  I really like this game.

Cleopatra and the Society of Architects is one of the many Days of Wonder games that I had been meaning to try for a while but hadn’t gotten around to playing (along with Colosseum which I finally tried recently and Shadows over Camelot which I still have yet to try). Cleopatra was interesting with the corruption mechanic and the upside-down cards, but other than a few neat parts and some very nice components, it wasn’t especially compelling or memorable.

After I had unwrapped everything my first question was: Will all tiles fit into the box again after playing?
In the meantime I've played it many times and I've really enjoyed it. There are several strategies possible for gaining winning points, but it would be bad advice just concentrating on one. The materials (although mainly plastic) look good. The game mechanism is easy to learn and finely balanced. The game was a good choice for me. And, by the way, everything fits into the box nicely...

Not as bad of a game at all as most reviews would indicate. I believe the components are nice, slightly overproduced, but hey, who am I to argue with pretty pieces? I guess if it meant bringing the price down a tad bit, then I am ok with that. Gameplay is not very deep, but the luck factor in this game is quite huge, especially the card drafting part. However, this game does shine in simplicity and newbies should not have too much trouble absorbing the rules. Will give it a medium rating since this game is not all that unique in terms of mechanisms.

11/2013
Played it again after several years and the game is actually decent. The reviews aren't always glowing but to counter some of my own comments a few years back, there are several mechanisms that remain relatively rare. The split face up/down deck is quite fresh. I don't know any other game that uses this particular method to give partial information to gamers. The corruption track (ala High Society) while not novel, is quite thematic in the context of this game. Overall, a gorgeous game with above average game play. You could do much worse.

I got to play a full demo game of Cleopatra at Origins 06.  There is quite a bit going on in this game and there is quite a bit of luck involved as well.  I think the game is interesting and varied enough that a little luck won't hurt it.  I enjoyed my game, but I am still very unsure about the corruption aspect.  I am not a big fan of High Society because I don't really like the automatic elimination.  It does add tension to the game, but it isn't the kind of tension I like.  High Society is a shorter game, the stakes are lower, and there isn't any luck.  This game is longer and there are face down cards in the draw piles.  You could take a chance on a face down pile late in the game and easily get four corruption or more late in the game.  A bad draw like that could easily take you out of the game.  I'm sure that doesn't happen all that often, but I doubt it would be fun.  I still like the game, but my concern is strong enough to keep me from buying the game until I have played it several more times.

P.S.  In our game the guy who shuffled split the deck, turned half the cards face up and then shuffled like he was supposed to.  Unfortunately, he did that several more times.  It seemed like a good idea at the time (someone even said so), but on reflection, I think it was a mistake.  This not only randomized the cards, but also randomizes the distribution of face-up to face down cards.  I think a 50/50 mix is important to the game, and I am pretty sure that there were more face-down cards than there should have been.

RATING: 6.5
Reminds me *very* strongly of Ticket to Ride, in that you collect sets to claim certain certain limited-opportunity items (routes or temple parts) which get you points.  The two games being from the same pretty plastic overload publisher that is DoW also contributes ot this impression.

In TtR one strings together of routes to fill tickets, where Cleopatra has limited hand size and the corruption counterweight.  I think that Cleopatra's chrome is a little heavier and more plasticky than TtR's, but that doesn't translate into much of anything.

Similar to Blue Moon City, but both prettier and with less player interaction. Either draw cards or build with the cards you have, but try not earn too much corruption.

Nice light strategy game - similar to Settlers of Catan in that you are collecting resources and building - not as deep as Catan, though.  Very easy to learn and the rules are very straight-forward.  Components are outstanding.  In terms of gameplay, managing your corruption is the challenging aspect of this game - you can't be the person with the most!!  The game moves quickly and has lots of small but interesting choices to make.

A bit fiddly in terms of lots of small bits - organizing the money, restocking markets after almost every player, putting the game away.  Enough of an annoyance to me that I docked the game a point in my rating.

There's a lot to like here: the face-up card draw, the corruption penalty, the whole 3D concept.  However, having played once, I don't warm to the game.  On that occasion I felt the decisions to be made didn't seem particularly critical or interesting (our strategy was to draw the greatest number of cards as quickly as possible, then with a full hand build the best temple piece available), there was little tension (maybe because of our choice of strategy), and there was some down-time (generally on the occasions we did plan ahead for a particular piece, and then had to re-plan our hand of cards to do something else).  Also, for my taste, the game is simply over-produced.

I've only played it once, and that was a session during which I was in a pretty bad mood, so keep that in mind when reading this comment.  Felt like a lot of mechanics that are neat, but don't really work.  The market seems like a cool idea, but most of the cards aren't different enough to make it worthwhile to take anything other than a) the most cards or b) the most cards that you can take without going over ten.  Likewise, the different options to build feel like they should be balanced, but some of them seem strictly better than others.

This game leads to an idiotic amount of analysis paralysis for what it is.  I'm starting to get sour on it but I'll give it one more chance.

The components and half-upside-down deck shuffle are charming, but the rest of the game is decidedly less so.  When you aren't getting screwed on card draws for what you need or beaten to what you want by other players, you're sitting there endlessly bored while they think through their turn for an hour.

First play with 5. Very cool bits. You can see the buildings going up as you play. Cursed cards help you erect the buildings quicker but be careful, the person at the end of the game with the most corruption is automatically eliminated. The player with the most money (favor?) wins at the end. I enjoyed this although I made several mistakes that caused me to finish well out of the lead. I didn't have the most corruption lukcily though and two players tied for the most so I got to place third! Second play 5/12/08 - I played with a strategy this time. Avoid the corruption, build mosaics early and only build multiple pieces. My first build was two mosaics and I put down my guys. That would save me 6 corruption at the end game. I got the beggar which is the best card in the game, imho. I bid 9 talent at the auction and only recvd 1 corruption and I built 4 (FOUR!) walls on another turn. It turns out that I overbid at the auction because I was 6 corruption fewer than the croc bait at the end of the game but I still won by 7 talents. 51-44-41-38-36(dead).

You build the temple of Cleopatra. In order to do so you need to lay cards. Those cards are put down with 1 card up, 1 down, etc. No problem so far but some of these cards are "corrupt". If you use to many corrupt cards you get eaten by the crocodiles. You can avoid that by building a floor on the temple on wich you can lay your corrupt amulets.

Because of the disqualification in the event of a tie rule, we ended up with a winner by default (3 way tie in a 4 player game), despite the number of victory points people had, which was kind of annoying but kind of fun at the same time (I didn't win).

The game is intriguing and compelling, despite there being a good bit of randomness to a large part of your choices.  I like that the designers used the half-deck-face-up mechanism to allow for some foreknowledge with a little hidden information, so there's some unknown in the choices you make.  I'm not sure I like the corruption mechanism, at least in the sense of there only being two ways to get rid of it.  The die rolling aspect of it leaves a little too much to chance, and as a result, there doesn't seem to be much strategy in taking a lot of corruption to get rid of it later in the game.

Players, however, will be tempted to deal with shady characters and trade in materials of dubious origins in order to help them build faster. While these corrupt practices might allow an architect to stay a step ahead of the rest, they come with a high price - cursed Corruption Amulets honoring Sobek, the Crocodile-god. When Cleopatra finally strolls into her new palace, at the end of the game, the most corrupt architect (the one with the most amulets) will be seized and offered as a sacrifice to her sacred crocodile! Only then will the wealthiest architect, from among those still alive, be selected and declared the winner of the game.

Not bad, but not fantastic.  There seemed to be a fair amount of downtime due to an inability to plan moves in advance because the market stalls changed so quickly.  I'm not sure if this was a fluke or not, but artisans seemed rather hard to come by, which also made building choices pretty limited when visiting the quarry.

This is *NOT* a game to play with those who despise hidden-but-trackable information.  Otherwise, it's all been done before, since, and better.  But look at those obelisks!

RATING: 7
a seemingly subtle game of palace building, players race to become the most talented (see whati did there huh? yes ok it's an asterix joke *sigh*) architect by fair means or foul, using resorce cards to build items for cleo's palace, corrupted resources count double but make you look mighty tasty to the royal crocdiles.

do you hurry to finish hopeing that the sanctuarys you build and freindly merchanst you employ can offset your corruption or build slow and solidly?

fun and comparativly simple game with lovely pieces (it even uses the box bottom as an integral part of the game)

also got this for free from days of wonder with an order for memoire 44 stuff :) so well done DoW for that 

P.S. the "quarry" piece of plastic from which players "excavate" the palace pieces while a nice idea and fair to look at is really annoying to pack up at the end of a game :S

RATING: 7
Tons of different mechanics all smashed together, and some of them are really clever (like shuffling the cards half face up, half face down).  Seems like it might be too much before playing, but it's actually pretty simple and works well.  The tension created by the corruption mechanic is outstanding.  I wish there was more strategy in the card market system, though the hand management aspect of the cards is very good.  Also, all interaction is of the competing-for-the-same-stuff variety, so if you want something more direct, keep that in mind.  Overall, a good game.  I bought it for my parents, and I'll be happy to play it with them any time.

Another DOW hit with great bits.  Wow, are the bits great.  A good Eurostyle game with a nice balance of luck and strategy but a game where greater risk can yield better reward (or ruin you) if you decide to use the shadier materials.  Love the tile/garden aspect of the game.

This game comes with great components and some neat mechanics. Scott Nicholson sold me on this and when it was on offer (just 5€) I had to pick it up. But I have not played it yet.

RATING: 6.5
I was tentative to pick this up after all the negative(-ish) reviews.  After playing it though I was very pleasantly suprised with how much fun it was.  Simple rules, interesting choices and beautiful components (although  I agree that using the box as part of the play area is not a good idea).

Should play well with almost any group of gamers, young and old, and only takes 40 minutes to play.

RATING: 7
This game, in parts, reminds me of Ticket To Ride, Settlers of Catan and Puerto Rico. Resource collecting like TTR and SOC. Trade-offs with strategy like PR. Building for points like TTR. As a family game, a plus is that the winner is not truly known until the end of the game. I like it better than TTR since there are more options.

RATING: 5
Not a bad game at all. I was pre-disposed to hate it because of the awful Shadows over Camelot, but was pleasantly surprised that there were decisions to be made.  I like how the game hangs together, and the mechanics match the theme.  Having half the deck shuffled face up and the other half face down seems to be a new mechanic I haven't seen elsewhere.  The game seemed to bog down at times, especially towards the end when people were short on cards, but this passed.  Components are nice.  It is "overproduced," but not in a bad way; most euros seem to cost around $50, and I dont think I would feel cheated at all by what was in the box.  The "5" rating is because this is not my kind of game...I will play, but will never ask for it.

RATING: 9
Production quality would get 10 out of 10. It looks like it will take longer to play than it does. Mechanics are simple and tactics determined by the cards you pick up.  This won't make your brain ache but may leave you feeling it was over just as you were getting started. Saying that though it is a good and enjoyable game if you only want a quick one.  Played again Dec 2014 and enjoyed it more than I thought.

I like playing the game. Yes, the game is overproduced, but it certainly doesn't clutter the gameplay (the game bits does give a good overview). Chris Farrell (as always) uses the words what I don't like about this game: [i]The biggest drawback is probably the scoring for the various monuments, which is why I doubt the game will have significant replayability. You're an idiot if you buy only one Sphinx, for example, and while Mosaics and Walls have some scoring synergy, it's almost impossible to synchronize them to your own benefit. I think that ultimately, the interplay between the different monuments and how they score doesn't really work. Because of the lack of functioning scoring synergies, it probably means that the obvious strategy (always take the pile with the most cards, then build whatever you can afford) is the best. All this doesn't kill the game, but neither does it bode well for the game's staying power. Bottom line, I think this is probably another classic Days of Wonder game - a decent game, but a lot more flash than bang. Not the disaster Shadows over Camelot was, neither does it demonstrate the same professionalism as Kosmos, Hans im Gluck, or alea. Like everything with overproduced bits these days it seems, the pieces came at the price of the last three rounds of playtesting that would have turned it into a real winner.[/i]

Many years later, with mmore experience, this seems a quite simple game after all, still very nice looking and fun but maybe a bit shallow, still very enjoyable

the game itself is complex but very interesting and very very rich. a very good experience

RATING: 6
Rating downgraded after 3rd play.
Interaction is basically: you take the cards the next player wants too, or you build the item the next player wants to build. Different building options are quite confusing if you have many cards (i had ~18 twice), but that might get better with more experience.
Very nice components.
Warning: analyss paralysis altert. Some people might take a long time to figure out what to build, and most of the time, you cannot plan ahead.

The corruption theme is awesome, but we found there was too much down time.  The worst is if you decide to just take cards on your turn - you then have to wait for what seems like way too long for the type of game C&tSoA is before your next turn.  In the end it blends together some pretty fun mechanics, but not for the time it takes to play.

[update 6/18]: Man I'm bummed I let this go for so cheap for two reasons: One it's commanding a serious premium right now, and two (and more importantly) I'm itching to play it again...

A solid collection game that starts out slowly and accelerates quickly as players start building.  Beautiful components and nice use of the box in the gameplay.  The corruption tokens are a very nice addition, because corruption gives advantages, but the most corrupt player gets fed to the crocodiles.

The worst-selling dud in the Days of Wonder line?  Unsurprising, given that this is based on the dullest secret society of all time.

Card efficiency is paramount. Good use of the mosaics allow you to use more of the tainted cards. Remember tainted cards are only bad if you have the most tokens. Having a few will not hurt you.

Played once (with 5 players). Some interesting ideas, although some of them (such as the pentaminos in the gardens) seem to be a bit out of place. The decisions seem to be fairly easy, and the players may lack some control on the endgame. However, I would play it again, ideally with less players.

RATING: 6
Yes, it has gorgeous pieces but I really don't get a sense that I can affect the outcome much. Lack of player interaction (the one game I played did not have the temple auction phase) left me feeling as if I were playing multi-player solitaire.  I should give it another chance but I just can't be bothered.  Most likely a good game just not for me.

Great components, clear rules, nice mechanisms used: everything you would expect from a Days of Wonder game. 

Downside: Not easy to explain, and downtime issue because the game is geared towards players taking monster turns.

A pretty simple collect-cards-and-turn-them-in game that gets a big boost from two things: awesome components and corruption markers. The latter just adds fun and some unexpected, but welcome, tension. The Egyptian theme is always a plus for me too.

RATING: 5
The one word I kept thinking whilst playing my first game of Cleopatra was 'fiddly'. Boy is it a fiddly game. The rules are fiddly. The bits are fiddly. Picking up the 'talents' is literally fiddly. The play is a variation on Ticket To Ride's pick up cards or play cards, but made more confusing by little sub-rules all over the place that I wasn't a hundred percent convinced I enjoyed the game as much as I thought I would.

I'm honestly surprised by how much I dislike the game.

After 1 Play: A lot of random bits thrown together into a workable but not very memorable game.  The bits are nice of course, but even they seem out of place considering what simple information that are actually representing.  The mosaic tiles, with their competing goals of maximizing points and creating sizable sanctuaries, and by far the most interesting part of the game.

A nice and fun family game. You have to admit that 60% of the appeal is because of the great production value. While the game behind it is not outstanding it still offers enough to make it interesting every once in a while. To it's defense you also have to say that it offers a mechanism I haven't seen in this form yet: the shuffeling of cards face up and face down together...
Overall recommended as a lighter to medium family game with high toy-factor.

Cleopatra is very lavishly produced.  I love the bits and the temple construction.  The game itself is interesting, but a bit too luck dependant for me.  Set collection games tend to leave me just a bit cold as a general rule.  Still, I have fun playing this for a very casual evening.

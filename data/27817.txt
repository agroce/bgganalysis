GAME: Marne 1918: Friedensturm
RANK: 3819

RATING: 9
Excellent game. 
This really feels like a WWI game. It simulates the difficulty of exploiting a breakthrough, as offensives rapidly stall. The tactical coordination rule is a very good idea, but may not suit you if you are the kind of gamer who wants to be in total control of combats.
The campaign is pure delight : specific rules (events, doctrine, reinforcements) add a lot to the basic game. And it is very tense : if the Allied player is able to handle the difficult first turns, both sides have their chances. 
Some minor flaws : air units don't add a lot to the game (but I have heard air rules will be improved in Somme 1918), and the map is not always readable (dark wood hexes with black hexes borders)

Great feeling of a combat, with the artillery, nice rules. IgoUgo type.
But tooooo long. 22 turns, plus up to 8 offensive, so, the campaing can last 38 "real turns", at least 30 minutes per turn because the combat resolution takes time and move of the artillery must be carefully thought, you get a 1200 minutes long game. 6-8 hours would have been much better.

This is a very exciting game and it's rules system is very intuitive. Despite the daunting look, the 4 basic game scenarios are all very playable.

RATING: 8.5
High quality components and some interesting mechanics come together in a very nice package. Small scenarios are rigid as far as options but that said the 3 turn Friedensturm game offers opportunities for both sides to be on the offensive and play with all the toys.

This is a relatively recent game of the hex-and-counter variety.  The game simulates an operational-level of the German offensives around Paris in May-August 1918.  The game comes with four scenarios and basic and advanced rules.  Even the basic rules should be considered medium-high difficulty.  Fortunately, the advanced rules do not change very many basic game concepts, but instead adds more random elements to the game.  A very enjoyable game for the WWI enthusiast, but not for the faint of heart when it comes to complexity.  See my review, here:  http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/418645/marne-1918-a-grognards-dream.

10/10/10 - Based on the strength of Liberty Roads, I have downgraded Marne a bit.

Great game ! The system is easy to learn and to play. It recreates the atmosphere of WW1, with the conditions of 1918. The campaign is really interesting to play, with both sides defending and attacking in turn. There is a certain fog of war and incertainty, with hidden reserves, chit pull system and offensive delaration.

Excited to learn this with my grognard friends!

Whoa! This is cool but I'm in way over my head here. Models the scenario perfectly. It is great, but too much to do in each move and attack. Love the way it unfolds as you play, but after 6 hours you feel drained, not exhilarated.

I finally took the time to learn this game by playing solo. It is a great game; very solid with interesting twists on typical mechanics that emulate the time and the place very well, I think. Artillery rules are very clever, as is activation method. 

I bought this late, after the first print run, so I paid a premium for it, but no regrets -- I am glad I have it in my collection.

RATING: 5
The scenarios have too little meat on them to be interesting.  Very process intensive system and even if you follow the designer's suggested method for resolving combat, you're still going to spend a lot of time plowing through charts.  Traded it off.

An excellent treatment of the offensive (and counter-offensive) that led to the end of the war. As usual Hexasim does a great job publishing. Game rules could be better. The counters are small and pretty typical. The map is lovely. Have not played the campaign but have it on my bucket list.

Excellent game. I just couldn't stop playing it. The Campaign is a very long affair, but the sceanrios are very fun and well-balanced. If you like WWI games buy this one, if you don't like WWI games, buy it anyway!

Very good recreation of the German 1918 offensive in the Champagne area.

Challenging battle though as the battle does not allow for errors. It is better to play a small scenario firts before playing the campaign as there are several funny design elements.

I love the game and still surch for an opponent.

Probably the best of the WW1 games I have played.

The components leave no room to complain; the map is fantastic, playaids have exactly what you need to speed play, and the rules and counters fit perfectly.  I think the only 'gray spot' in the rules for me was the portion covering the release of units during a declared offensive (which is critical to the game, but after reading thru the section a few times, it makes sense; I just did not think it was clear on the first take).

Gameplay moves pretty quick even with a relatively high counter density and has an amazing level of detail without adding complexity.

In short movement is in line with just about every other wargame, but comabt is a bit different.  Odds are calculated, then shifts applied (if you are familiar with the SPI Victory in the West system, you appreciate this as shifts can vastly improve success more than plain combat 'factors').  The main difference comes in the coordination roll based off unit effectiveness : this roll will determine advances after combat, retreats, additional losses, & ability to exploit after combat (move and / or fight).

The final main touch is the Random Events Chits which, without adding rules, can determine offensives, add tactics, and reflect political occurences that drove events on the battlfield at this time.  Great bit of detail at no cost in play time or rules.

For myself, this effectively took the simplicity of Ted Racier's WW1 games that I am familiar with, and added a big touch of detail (making a much better simulation in my opinion) without a burdened system.

Looking forward to see if this system moves ahead to cover new battles / campaigns.

12/31/08 Update

Slight revision down from 8.5 to 8 after my second play of the campaign game.  Not a reflection of anything wrong with the game - it's just that with the shine of a "new game" off, I've reevaluated the relatively heavy process involved in combat for the game.  I still like it, but it does cost the game slightly now.

Not a huge fan of ww1 games but this is an interesting clean game. Takes a while though. There are shorter scenarios as well. Gives late ww 1 feel. Will play it again! Solos fine.

Une réussite du tandem Pouchin/Rident. Le système rend parfaitement l'usure des armées et la rudesse des combats. L'ampleur du jeu permet à chaque camp d'être à tour de rôle (et de manière non scriptée) en offensive ou sur la défensive ce qui rend le jeu passionnant. Beaucoup de chrome avec les règles sur les doctrines et les événements aléatoires.

Haven't played it yet so I can't honestly rate it but it looks great. Components are great and rules really plunges you in WW1. Don't believe that it's a static game, many offensives, tanks, air support, morale, stosstruppen (and much more...) all that combined promises to bring a really good game. A note to US gamers, in this game the Bois-Belleau combat is simulated, US Marines in a WW1 game, isn't it tempting ? ;)

Great game ! Excellent material.

I played the scenarios.

System of offensives to simulate the big German breakthroughs and Allied counter-attacks.

Very well thought mechanisms of fight which get a tension and an uncertainty thanks to the brilliant "Maîtrise tactique"

Relevant and simple management of supports (tanks, aviation, Stosstruppen).

The campaign seems to be a great adventure.

Only tried a basic rules game so far. Great looking game, rules pretty easy to learn, but horribly lengthy setup, with every counter to be placed in a specific hex. Great for historical accuracy, bloody awful for entertainment...

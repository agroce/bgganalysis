I cannot see any strategy here, you just look at what tiles you've drawn and where you can earn most points at this given moment. In similar 'Metro' there was at least some interaction, this is very much solitaire-y.

An abstract tile-laying game where you add one tile to a row or column each turn.  Try to score points by playing cards in a tile that "dominates" that row/column.

RATING: 6.5
Good filler--some of the rules as written seem a little squishy (tile powers, what score dominates, what the Koshari tile does in certain situations).

I grew up with Hopi pottery, art and even two authentic Kachinas in my house. So I was disappointed that the publisher didn't find an artist that could do simple, graphic versions of authentic Hopi art. I think it would have made the tiles more readable, and less unnecessarily messy.

Still like the game enough to play semi-regularly. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.75
This tile-laying game feels like the next step beyond Qwirkle.  It has the same familiar pattern of play a tile and score for each tile in the same row and column.  The twist here is that you only score if you are "dominant" in that row/column.  That means your placed tile is the highest in value.

That might seem simplistic, but each tile has its own ability, some to manipulate the value of other tiles, and put yours to better advantage.  Meanwhile the Ogre tiles essentially block play, creating dead ends in the line.

What I like about this game is that it plays quickly and is easily understood, but it has some significant strategy which makes you think.  Plays great with 2 players but could work just as well with others (and may be a faster game).  The tiles aren't the best quality, but I like most of the art with this unique theme.

This is my first time playing Kachina. I liked the individual rule card each player is given which I referred to often.  I can see that with a few more plays, I will learn to plan my tile placements more strategically. Playing with people who have played before is helpful. I had that "DOH!' feeling a couple of times because I didn't realize I could place a tile in a particular place.  I'll get better.  Fun game!

RATING: 4
To be fair, I played this only once as a five player game.  I suspect my rating could be as much as a point or two higher with fewer players.  The difference between having a high scoring turn or not seemed to come down to three things: opportunity on the board, piece draw, and the ability to spot it.  For the game to be good the last factor has to be the highest.  Otherwise, it's just luck.  The possibility to play to hurt your neighbor is meaningless in a five player game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Looking at the simplicity, you might think it is a filler. No. Be prepared to burn those brain cells for about 30-45min .

Often rows/columns simply turn into "free scoring". I play a wolf, I dominate, get 2 points, you play a wolf, dominate, get 3 points, the next player plays a wolf, dominates, scores 4 points, I play another wolf, dominate, get 5 points, etc. But this doesn't happen that often, as the special abilities will react with each other. "Played an Ogre. Nope, you can't play that tile next to mine"

All the tiles are "universal" - no one owns any tiles as they lay them down. Yet you still like to say that row is "yours" and get upset because she messed up your plans for it.

Sometimes you just don't have the right tiles for the current situation. But don't most games have this feeling?

RATING: 6
A heavy tile-layer, one where your ability to place a piece can be severely restricted by the layout of what's gone before. A significant luck element in what you draw as values range from 1-8 and the special powers don't necessarily compensate for low value. There's also vulnerability to analysis paralysis and kingmaking.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A tile placing game that's all about the relationships of the tiles to each other, kind of like Qwirkle. It's different from Qwirkle, though, in that the tiles have different values and abilities that they can use.  It's an odd amalgam of things but I'm glad someone tried it.  On the other hand, some of the tiles are difficult to use and it's not so easy to manipulate the board to try to make them more useful (what is the Warrior good for, really? And what do you do when there are Ogres all around the perimeter?).  So it's a really interesting idea but it gets fairly frustrating, especially since some tiles are clearly more powerful than others.

Graphic design and component quality are not so good.

Very solid game. The art is fantastic. Gorgeous and Usable!!!

The game was a solid one too. Just to judge: I think I'm buying it tomorrow if I can find the author to sign it 

As for the gameplay:

The tiles all interacted in interesting ways, but the aid taught you fast and you didn't need it for very long.

Scoring did get harder though, so it did slow down towards the end and made it hard to catch the leader. But still, that was only a minor point. Nice game.

This is a brain burning abstract tile laying game. Very tactical, it's almost impossible to plan more than one turn ahead unless you can disguise what you're doing in some way. It brings out the AP in a pretty serious way. It's also fun, though, and the a lot of the tile powers actually do make thematic sense. This reminds me a bit of the card game Parade, where you pretty much have to go through the possibilities for every tile/card in your hand to determine the best move.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
An abstract tile-placement game with tiles of varying values and special rules. If the tile you place is the highest value in a row, you get a point. If it is also in a column and it is the highest value, you get another point. So every play you can get 0-2 points. The special rules for some tiles limit further placement, have different rules for scoring, or change the value of tiles around them. Enjoyable. Late in the game the placement restrictions can get severe, which takes out some of the fun and slows the game to a crawl. Uptown is in the same family of games and I enjoy that one more.

Reimplemented by Voluspa which didn't really change anything. I just don't really feel as if there's a game here. Every turn there is a best option, you just need to locate it. Yes, I am sure every game has a best option but in Kachina, that option is quite transparent so it just comes down to the luck of the draw. Luckily it's over quick.

RATING: 5
This is a relatively interesting tile-laying game where most tiles have some little power that affects how they can be played or the tiles around them.  To me, though, the game just isn't a lot of fun.  There's a lot of potential for analysis paralysis, and the whole thing is pretty ugly to look at.  Maybe I'm just not a fan of that style of artwork, however, because I've heard others say how nice it is.  And the death knell is the completely horrible score track, which actually seems to work against you and undermine your confidence that your score is actually correct. So if you want to try it out, just keep track of your score on paper, and maybe that'd be one less strike against it.

I'd rather just play Carc.  This is a fine tile laying game that does play differently, but not enough so that I care...:-)  Basically, you play a tile to a row and/or column and score 1 point for each tile in said row/column as long as you are the highest valued tile in the row/column.  A number of tiles have special abilities that give lower valued tiles power and/or value.

Quick games, chances for clever plays, and setting up moves ahead of time. There's definitely a rhythm to the game where players follow each other, each scoring one more point than the last one, so the goal is to make sure you can profit more than other people from your tile placements. Lucky draws also help

Tile laying game where you have 5 tiles and play one down per turn. Each tile has a special ability that allows you to determine if you have played the 'dominant' tile on that row or column.

RATING: 6
This tile-laying game can best be described as Qwirkle with special abilities.  You place a tile in a row and score points for the length of the row, but only if you "dominate" it by having the highest value in that row.  However, the values of the tiles range from 1 to 7, and the lesser-value tiles all have special abilities that allow them to dominate rows with higher values.  It's a fun game, but there are some rather severe graphic design flaws--the tiles are hard to tell apart, and the score track is awful.  Additionally, not including a draw bag here is a sin.

Dominoes on steroids. Worked well, even if we did get a major rules wrong (scoring Ogres like Wolves).

Look forward to playing again.

Likable theme. Nice artwork if a bit busy; it would be helpful if the different tiles were more easily distinguished at a glance. Gameplay is tactical rather than strategic. More chaotic with higher numbers of players. Excellent, comprehensive player aids double as markers to show your player color. Box insert is very nicely designed and holds everything snugly with almost nothing rattling loose—we only added a tiny baggie for the score markers.

For a small publisher/small-box game, Kachina excells at being a simple rules set that packs a big punch in gameplay. We found that the game played very well as both a 2-player and 3-player game. I would venture that at 4-players it would be just as good. It may lose some stratigic points at 5 players but undoubtedly would still be a wonderful game. This is a must-have for those looking for solid, two-player abstracts that scale up effectively while The theming fills out the play appropriately. Don't pass this one up!

One play so far using a prototype copy.  The various strengths and powers of the pieces make this an interesting tile-laying game.  The game is a bit mathy; but there is more than just plopping down whichever tile where it gets you the most points immediately:  you also need to look ahead and consider if that tile might get more points if used in a more opportunistic manner.  The fairly simple rules and quick playing time make this an excellent filler.  [2009-MAY-07]

Has surprisingly deep strategy for such simple rules.
With the FAQ here on the geek, all questions we had about the rules were solved (looking forwards to see those FAQs printed in the next version of the game). Now, it's time to play this many many times in order to get a feel for the best strategies. 
I recommend using tile holders from Ingenious, they make this game truly marvelous. Also, I recommend correcting the rules book, there are quite many errors in there.

An interesting abstract tile-laying game. Tiles are numbered 1-8, most with special powers and in different numbers. Shuffle them all, and give each player a random hand of 5. Take turns playing tiles Scrabble style, scoring VP if you dominate the row/column (highest number in the word; max 7-length word). The special powers modify dominance. Draw back to a hand of 5. Play till all tiles have been played.

It's actually a decent game -- the best from this company so far -- but I think it would be best with 2 (less chaos, less luck of the draw). Maybe even better if each player had half the deck, from which they created their own draw pile?

The tiles are very sturdy and nicely thick, although the artwork is a bit busy. The rulebook could be a lot better, too! Still, not a bad little game for fans of abstract games.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Components: solid bits and nice art; pity about the gloss finish. 

Gameplay: reasonably interesting tile-laying game with a hefty dose of randomness in tile draws. The box says "strategy" a lot but it's hard to see how you can plan much in advance -- the shared tile pool means that your opponents can benefit from any efforts you make to set up a scoring opportunity. Playing open-handed might improve things. In any event, a pretty good filler.

Very colourful tile laying game where we all build a grid and try to score with every placement. The tiles would have been better unlaminated so they didn't reflect so much, but it stays on my wishlist.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A nice tile laying game with wonderful art. Every tile has a value and will dominate the row or column it is placed in if it is the highest.  The kicker is that the lower value tiles have special powers that make them a little stronger than just their number.  This gives a lot to think about on the turn to maximize placement priority.  I like the simplicity of the game.  After many plays I have discovered the subtlety of using some tiles offensively and it has changed the game for me.  A nice discovery.  It's a back and forth competition until the end, when the final pieces must be used most effectively.  In games with more than 2 the scores get a little more spread out.  

There are some tricky moves in the game you can pull off mostly if other players are not paying attention.  A lot of tension builds as you cross your fingers hoping they don't see your set up.  

Unfortunately that is all there is to it.  I would like to see if new powers might bump it up to something a more than tit for tat.

update : The expansion gives a little wiggle room but not much.  The moves they provide are nerfed quite a bit by design.

Interesting tile laying game. I like the different powers. Trying to utilize your hand to the best of your abilities is tough.

create rows and columns by adding tiles.  If your tile is the Dominant Kachina, highest valued tile, in the row or column, you score a point for each tile in the row and/or column.

also, most tiles have special powers, such as make adjacent tiles power 0, steal a tile, play on top of a tile, etc.

simple nice mechanics, not a totally awesome game, but we enjoyed it drinking a beer sitting on the porch..........4 players.  

i think 2 or three players might be better for creating an offensive and defensive system of creativity and cleverness.  too hard to set yourself up with 4 people, cuz they will be able to take advantage of your plays instead of you.

great for kids to learn math, spacial stuff.

(10/09)   After 1 4p game.  This is a nice tile placement, hand management game.  Very impressive for a first published game.  I would like to play again.  Reminds me a little of mash up of Kingdoms and Qwirkle - 2 games I enjoy.

2009 release date - first published game - tile laying

Rating after one solo game but now that I know how it plays this feels like a game I'll try to get into play with some regularity. 

Cover art is lame, but the tiles are pretty good.

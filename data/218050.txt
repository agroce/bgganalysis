This was an interesting push your luck dice coop. I'd like to play again as we didn't do too well. I like the mechanics. It might be a little too long for it's particular strategic depth, but it seems pretty variable and balanced, albeit a little lucky.

2017  Push your luck firefighting game.  Plays quick, dice rolling mechanic pretty straight up push your luck with a little chrome, but the terrain tiles and random setup do make for different tactical challenges each game.  Enjoyed a lot more than I thought I would, although the game does seem a bit too easy without using the difficulty options to ramp it up, and needs more role options as well (only 4?)  Lots of variations offered in terms of tile setup and options to tweak difficulty.

RATING: 9
Great, fast coop or solo game that delivers on the theme.  What I love best is the strong temptation to press your luck, with the penalty being a blowup and additional spread of the fire.  Also the wind change concept, and the highly volatile tiles like the propane tank and the dead tree.  Of the several times I've played now, it's come down to the wire each time and gone both ways.

RATING: 7
Very interesting coop game in which your group of firefighters attempt to stop forest fires. Like a lot of cooperative games, each role gets its own special power to provide some interesting asymmetry. The game also has a really neat push-your-luck mechanism to fight the fire by rolling dice instead of allocating action points. The game is easy to teach and plays are quick so it will likely appeal to a wide range of gamers. Definitely worth trying!

I bought this because I wanted a light game I could play by myself sometimes. My teen and I had fun fighting the fires, and we lucked out with the cards we drew when we drew them. So we won. I think it will be fun to try it again. Easy to learn. I just wish there was one summary page in the rule book because we kept flipping all or to see what dice rolls meant and what the symbols were.

Enjoy this more than Pandemic. Pandemic seems just unreasonably difficult. I can see where Hotshots might wear thin, as you can win by the game effectively burning itself out of moves. I think the push your luck factor of the dice roll is what makes this better than Pandemic. In pandemic the move is simplistic: go remove a cube and that's it. In Hotshots you have the added pressure of balancing risk and reward.

Based on one play

The game quickly took us to 6 (of 8) burned areas, but then we got things pretty much under control. At that point it went into a feedback loop of the game placing 1-3 fire tokens a turn and the acting player removing 1-3. It went on like that for quite a while. I had a friend waiting so I had to leave my character to the group for the remainder of the game, so I'm not sure if either they or the game finally got any momentum or they just decided to call it.

I thought it was a clever dice coop at first, but if that dragging is something that happens often I wouldn't want to play again. (I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt with a 6 rating.)

A final note, because of the many comparisons to Flash Point, I'll say that imho, it's nowhere near as good. FP simply won't let the above occur; any time you think you have things under control and you can catch your breath the game fights back hard, the building starts to shake from structural damage, and everyone has to run for their lives. Add to that all the great expansion material, the depth and variety of characters and maps, and it's just no contest.

My advice: let Hotshots be a simple dice-chucking coop and don't let the theme tempt you to ask it to punch above its weight.

When I saw the game setup in the store here in Portland, I just had to have it since there's so much going on with forest fires in the Gorge recently (September 2017).

This game isn't too expensive. Once you learn the game it might take 5 minutes to setup a random game (maybe a little longer). After 3 plays of this you learn it's more about controlling the fires and how they burn than putting fires out (although you do still have to put out fires). It seems like it'd be pretty realistic in that you build fire breaks in appropriate places, use the vehicles efficiently and in a timely manner, and even let areas burn out that you know will become firebreak in themselves. You can push your luck. You can use the terrain to your advantage. But, push your luck too far and don't use things effectively and your fire can get out of control pretty quickly just from and ember or some high winds that go right across firebreaks. This is a pretty fun little game.

This game in no way "stinks", as one other reviewer put it. The co-op market is a bit flooded at the moment, and Pandemic gets all the attention, but cool little games like this are so much more interesting if you ask me. I'm really liking the theme and variable setup. The solo game is fun with interesting decisions. All in all I'm just really enjoying this package; a simple game at its core, but there's enough going on that it keeps my mind engaged.

Quite hard and fun game. Gameplay is smooth.
You won't like it if you hate the dice, but if you don't mind, the game breathes theme and certainly doesn't feel like a cheap yahtzee variant.
Component quality is better than expected and solo play is very enjoyable

Just not as good as other similar games, like pandemic per say. Thought my first game at Tim's house was a bit easier than expected, I think we just got lucky with the wind and flame cards perhaps?

Saw this demo'd at Origins and was immediately hooked.  A co-op game that bears a little resemblance to Forbidden Island as far as unique player abilities, Hotshots adds so much more depth without getting overly complicated.  Each player has a unique ability and each hex tile (the board is modular) shows which symbols you'll need (via dice rolls) to put out a fire on that hex.  Different tiles have different limits as to how many fires can break out on them before the tile is destroyed (scorched).  Also, wind direction is a brilliant feature in the game that can shift which way flames spread to other tiles.  To aid the firefighters, there are three vehicles in the game that allow for a one-time fire-extinguishing use (four if you count the promo ATV piece).  For instance, the plane can strafe three hexes and put out a flame on each one.  The truck provides fire barriers that prevent a flame from spreading to a neighboring hex.  The game was a blast and I can't wait for its release this autumn.

It's kind of like Pandemic on hex tiles with push your luck dice rolling. Very well-designed game, plays super easy and fast. Highly recommend for families or just casual games with friends. I bought a copy right away.

This felt like a cheap knockoff of Flashpoint or Forbidden Island. You're putting out forest fires, but much like real life, you can be at it awhile as the fires annoyingly spread in small groups across the map. It would be so much better if you could remove fires from adjacent locations, but then again, that would probably make this too easy. Fantastic production, but the game stinks.

This one has a cool theme and cool fire pieces, but the co-op combined with the dice rolling didn't do it for me. It felt like decisions were vary obvious, I had no control, and I either rolled or busted with no in-between.

After playing Flash Point at the game cafe, enjoying it, and preparing to buy it... they didn't have it in stock. However, the shop worker suggested Hot Shots. It was a very good suggestion, as we certainly enjoyed it. I would say it isn't quite as exciting as Flash Point, but the gameplay is a little better suited for the younger kids. However, the game can drag on a bit longer than some attention spans.

I liked this cooperative game. I don't know that it added enough for me to feel like it was different enough to end up buying it for my own collection though. I do like rolling dice and the "farkle" mechanic of continuing to re-roll as long as you are able to lock another die each time. That really makes the abilities that allow for swapping dice faces to be very powerful. I'm sure there is a lot of math and statistics that I could find to support that claim. The amount it helps depends on what results you are needing to get and what you've locked from previous rolls. With the dice and the card events, there is a decent amount of luck that can make the game much harder or easier. It's something that is more acceptable in a co-op game. I'd happily play this fast filler game again. There was a bit to explain and iconography to explain. I'm not sure I ever understood what the card events did. I relied on the owner of the game and even he seemed to need to verify it with the rule book.

I might end up picking this up at some point if I don't get it in trade first. I don't have any co-op games in my collection and I really dig the theme here plus there's dice. It seems like it'll become samey after a few plays though so hopefully it does well and it get can get some expansion love eventually.

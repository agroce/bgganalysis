A solid game and good for playing solo.  Yes you can play solo as the Predators, you just have to do it right. Legendary Encounters: Alien is so much better though, so buy it instead of this.

RATING: 3
There have now been several attempts to marry deck building to a theme less abstract than Dominion's.  I tell myself that if only a game did this very well then I'd find the deck building mechanics more engaging. The basic concept of this one seems promising; a team of humans stranded in the jungle and hunted by a super powerful alien.  Unhappily, the execution is inept. Dominion offers a choice of 16 card types to buy; Predator gives you a choice of six.  Dominion always offers a range of prices; five of Predator's six cards are drawn randomly, they might well all be beyond your means and what's more there is nothing to stop this selection from silting up with high cost cards. Contrast how Predator's adversaries all troop on in an orderly line with the way they pop up everywhere in Ghost Stories.  Then there's the luck of the draw from hugely variable enemy strike and barracks decks.  In short, Predator recycles mechanisms and renders them dull, lucky or botched.

Group fave, I enjoy this. 2nd time buying as hated first game but love the mini-mission completion option. 1 game at group and they all cut and 'get to the choppa' leaving 2 of the 5 behind to die. Seems a very popular format for all in series played so far. Still to test Vs mode.

RATING: N/A
Adds more variety to the Alien iteration of the game and allows crossover & mash-up--how cool is that. Less of a fan of these movies (first was okay as far as 80s films go), but thematically it works and really mixes up what you can do with the system. Love it!

RATING: 9.1
Absolutely awesome, even more bang for your buck than the already excellent Aliens version. You get a lot more cards here so that you can play from either the Humans' perspective or the Predators, and they don't play too differently, but the Predators have cool Challenges and other cards mixed in. Can't wait to combine this with Aliens and some of the Marvel heroes, but just what you get in the box alone is superb. Good artwork, good mechanics, and once again this system provides for the greatest thematic deckbuilder you can acquire.

The Playing as the Predator is the BEST part of this game!  WOW!  I am going to look into adding Traps and Challenges and Tests to Regular Legendary (Taking the Activate cards out etc...) but MAN the Play through the movie parts is fun, pretty hard but its just as good as the Alien one, which IMO isn't as fun as the Super Hero.... now Playing as the Predators (and I am sure the Aliens in Quasi VS mode)... is AMAZING!  Really good!

RATING: 9
Predator is a second-rate franchise compared to Alien, but the game stands on equal footing for sure. Following suit by allowing players to play through the movie scenarios, but also adding more depth to playing as the enemy. Both games will fit in one box, and the possibilities are endless with the tools they've given you here; both in terms of the variety of cards, and rules for playing many different ways. Legendary is fantastic game in every incarnation, and Predator brings a unique theme to the table.

As a "game" this is much less interesting than dominion although there is a good amount of choices to be made and choices with limited information until you get used to the cards in the set.  Theme and art is where it shines which is also where dominion is a little weak.  Not played the competitive game yet but looking forward to.  I cannot see me playing this lots and lots like dominion but will enjoy each of the few dozen plays I see this getting (maybe more if I like the competitive game).

Great cooperative deck building game, although compared to Aliens I think I like Aliens more as the cards seemed to combo better and had higher attacks compared to the Predator ones.  But in the end the predator game was still difficult and I enjoyed playing through that movie as well.

The cooperative mode plays essentially the same as in L-E:Alien but with one huge advantage, this game never stalls out at the end.
And then the Predator mode is a really nice change of pace.

As soon as I heard of this game I knew I had to get this. As a fan of the theme and the "LE: Alien"-game I had to have this.

This ... is ... awesome! The Co-Op part is like the one in Alien.
The new twist is the confrontational mode which is a s**t-load of fun. Trying to beat the humans in a Semi-Co-Op way where you also want to kill your fellow players when the opportunity comes.

Love it.

This game would have rated higher if LE:Alien wasn't so d@mn good. :D
LE: Predator is unique giving the ability to play as Predators to hunt humans! (Note: if your co-op is friendly then these campaigns are easy)

Best of all it integrates with LE:A so you can kill Aliens as Dutch, Mac and Blaine, and because of the predator mode, with LE:AE & a few house rules, have a true AvP scenario -- Humans vs Alien Queen vs Predators. *mind blown*

If you're familiar with any of the Upper Deck "Legendary" games, then you should have no problem jumping right into this "Predator" version. The mechanics are great fun, as always. I have only two complaints. One, it's a shame that teammates have nothing to do if/when they die (and teammates probably will die ... this game is hard). Two, it takes a LONG time to set this game up. Pro tip: sort your cards BEFORE you play your first game, because they come totally mish-mashed in the box.

Not as many scenarios to play as its Alien big brother, but being able to play as the Predators in a competitive mode seems like it would be a blast.  I still think the majority of the characters in the Predator set have more personality (and great one-liners).

RATING: 10
Improved implementation from Aliens pretty though and very enjoyable. We are fans of the movies and we enjoy the Legendary system with all its flaws.

As Alien's the hard part is to divide the card and create the decks, when you get it done you can setup and play fast.

Although the system is similar, Predator didn't have the intensity of the Aliens game to me, especially when Aliens is played with the optional rules. It just seemed to lack the spark of the other game.

RATING: 6.2
A cooperative combat based on deck building where basically a player buy skills and plays combat cards against the foes. The use of cards from other players can be requested to them, in order to maximize the power of our own hand.
With a few more plays maybe there are some twists around the localizations, the theme and the objectifs but, overall, it´s a kind of game i really don´t fancy.

Bough after playing Alien version for quite a while. It has the same mechanics although game feels like they put less effort in this one than in Alien version. Hazards always do the same thing, only difference is where you put an enemy from the Enemy deck. I liked the variety in Alien. This game ends like feeling like a ghost and with dull experience. Although I haven't yet dared to play as Predators against Humans, I have tried playing as Predators against Aliens and Aliens completely overwhelmed us (me and my friend that owns Alien version) and game didn't last long and wasn't really fun.
This is not complete review, just my presonal view of the game after 10 or so games.

Basically the same game as the Alien version. It's challenging, and I never seem to do quite as much as I want to do. Maybe I am spoiled by Dominion. You either tend to lose the game catastrophically, or sometimes win it 'easily'. It's also harder with higher player counts.

This I use more as a supplement to the LE: Alien Deck Building game, so I can add characters, scenarios, etc. I've not gotten into the Predator game side of it. Thus, for me this is a slightly more limited box (2 predator films vs 4 alien ones), plus I'm a little less keen on the theme. Still, very coolly executed, and I'd happily play more of this - and if Alien wasn't sitting right next to it on my shelf, I may well opt for this more.

I love the Legendary Encounters series for how well it renders an IP. The card system allows for great flexibility; a card can be a character, an item, or a memorable situation or quote.

This game takes the LE system and refines it further by adding new ways to play cards for special effects and for how to play the game. Plus, you can play the game as humans cooperatively, predators competitively or cooperatively, or merge it with LE: Alien for an AvP game.

RATING: 8.875
I love, love, love:
- the nostalgia of the movies
- that I can play a full game of this in the time it takes to play the corresponding movie's soundtrack
- being able to play as the humans and as a Yautja
- being able to trip each other up as Yautja in our quest for Honor
- combining this game with the Alien version to play for Honor or just to win against the Xenomorphs

I dislike:
- that the pacing of the game doesn't match the movies

Final verdict: Love this game, always fun to play. I do find fault with the game that there are no breaks for the players to have a breather; once the Predator shows, it's essentially non-stop combat, and the endings of the movies, especially allowed some time for the main character to gear up for the big fight. Otherwise, the game is ALMOST perfect in recreating the movies.

RATING: 6
I don't know why, but I like this less than its Alien cousin. Maybe it's because I don't care for the theme, or maybe the competitive mode (which is what a good half of the cards in the game is about) feels lackluster. I don't know. I just don't enjoy it as much as Alien.

Disclaimer: I never saw Predator and the theme means nothing to me; I much prefer the Marvel theme.  What's cool here is the "coordinate" ability which lets you play cards on other people's turns to assist them.  This really adds to the co-op feeling of the game.  They should definitely add this mechanic, or something like it, to the Marvel version. The addition of a player character who has stats makes it feel more like a RPG but the defense stat should be for the co-op game too, not just PvP.  The negative here is player elimination which is never good, especially on a game that's not short and of course it's particularly bad in a two player game.

If you're familiar with the Marvel version, this is very similar except: the enemies are put on the board face down and you have to pay damage to reveal them, you have a player character with HP, you take damage and your character can die.

Legendary Encounters: A Predator Deck Building Game is the second implementation of the Legendary Encounters series. This edition takes on the two Predator movies (Predator 2 is a hilariously awful movie). It's essentially two games in one, one fully cooperative game and one semi competitive.

Compared to Aliens, it feels definitely streamlined in someways. Adding some great new abilities and combos. The biggest difference is that since it IS two games, it lacks the customization of it's Aliens counterpart.

It's a great game, but honestly I prefer Aliens. I love predator as a movie more, but Aliens just has so much customization and gameplay in the box.

Not as solid as the Alien version. I have almost zero desire to play the game competitively, and Predator 2 is a horrible movie, so I'm not invested in the character's as much. But I love the encounters system so much that I still like more variety. I always play it combined with Aliens.

So far so good. This one starts you out slow and builds to a flesh fest, for the predator, on the first scenario. As long as you die honorably I guess it is okay to lose.

Much the same as the alien version - excellent.

The addition of the Predator mode is very well done, too. You get to use Predator technology to slaughter humans which get stronger until you're fighting against main characters from the movies - fantastic!

Love Encounter Aliens so this was the next logical Step. The main difference here is we are sacrificing some coop replayability (only 2 movies are including unlike 5 in Aliens) but they added the PVP gameplay which makes thematic sens for a Predator game. In that mode, Each predator fight and kills humans to gain prestige and trophy. The predator with the most win the game. Very Thematic and suiting for this game.

This mode makes it a nice change vs Alien and a welcome addition to the collection.

An interesting premise was hoping for a "legit" Aliens Vs. Predator mode, but it's nothing more than a slight rules change on the formula. I loved Alien Encounters, and I thought this would be a sure winner. But the characters cards feel lacking compared to the previous game, and the competitive mode feels tacked on, and sadly makes up more than half of the cards in the game. 

Upper deck needs to stay focused on Alien. They keep branching out with the same system now in the Firefly, Big Trouble in Little China, and now Buffy franchises, they getting worse than Cryptozoic and Munchkin. Focus on your winners, Marvel and Alien, UDE!

As far as deck builders go, this is one of he most thematic. I like this better than most because it gives you so many play options, each the equal to the other in quality. Co-op, one against all, competition.... Brilliant execution all the way around.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (December 2016)

I heavily dislike Legendary: A Marvel Deck Building Game, the reason is that game offers two variable market offerings (the one players buy cards from and the one players attack cards from). This causes the game to have a low level of strategy and many (most?) times luck decides the winner. I hate this kind of playing because it is competitive,  and thus, unfair to all players. Why should I lose a 90 minute  (or more) game just because I wasn’t able to buy the same card my opponent did on his turn? For that reason I only like deckbuilding games with a static market offering (Dominion, Tanto Cuore, Nightfall) in which strategy is more important than tactics. Having saying that, I don’t mind this unfairness IF the game is cooperative and I bought Legendary Encounters: A Predator Deck Building Game under the premise that the game was ONLY cooperative and it was a disappointment to find the game is also competitive. The disappointing part is that the game comes with much more cards for the competitive variant than the cooperative variant :/. I also thought that Legendary: A Marvel Deck Building Game was only competitive, but perhaps there is a mode to play it cooperatively (I never read the rules of that game).

The rules are easy to grasp, you can explain them under 10 minutes, however your first play is very slow because you need to sort the 700 cards and that chore will take more than 1 hour. I don’t understand why Upper Deck Entertainment doesn’t  print and package the cards already ordered.  After that, you need to prepare the scenario and that also takes some time and after playing the game you need to split the cards again. To summarize, the setup and tear-down times are very high (a minus for me).

The theme is great, I love the movies and this game lets you play the scenarios from the movies. The art is also very well done.

I really enjoyed the cooperative experience. The game is hard to beat as any good CoOP should be and I want to play all the scenarios. There is a lot of luck in the game (a huge minus). There is uncontrollable luck with the available cards to purchase and with the hidden enemies. This level of luck in unacceptable in a competitive setting but it doesn’t bother me much in a cooperative one.

Best with 3 players, I refuse to play with 5 players, the downtime is too much for such a simple game.

Bottom line, I have two minds about Legendary Encounters: A Predator Deck Building Game. The cooperative game is great, I would rate it a solid 7.5 only for that, however, as I wrote before, the competitive mode is such a turn off for me that I already sold the game. The reason is that the game has much more cards dedicated to the competitive variant than the cooperative one. If asked, I would rate the competitive variant a 3.5, so I’m compromising and I´m rating the whole game a 5.5. I would always play the cooperative variant if requested, but Dominion continues to be king for me in the Deckbuilding genre. I played the Predator set before the Alien´s one, but as they are so similar, I already sold the Alien set as well. Too much luck for me.

3 plays in on 2 player (co-op Predator 1)and initial verdict is: brutal.  We managed with luck to get the minor goal and get to the choppa, but only barely.  Definitely feels like the hero fight numbers for this scenario are lower than all the ones in Alien, so no cake walking through it. 

That said, we're making progress and like it. Movies are queued up and we'll be trying other modes eventually.

Not as enjoyable as Legendary: Alien since I only play these games solo and there's just two missions to play instead of four in Alien. 

I really wish there was a more challenging solo mode to play as just the predators.  It was overwhelmingly dull to play as them since they destroy everything instantly without another real player competing with you.

Still, characters from Predator are a blast to play with, and I plan to bring them over to the Alien set as well.

RATING: 4
I’m dinging this game on the cluttered presentation, a large part of which is due to the two-games-in-one construction. Setting up this game is messy, even by Legendary standards. 

Mechanics are clever but some are confusing on the first play-through because you don’t see later cards that make them understandable. For instance, there’s a Guerilla that damages you if you kill him and the base isn’t on the board. During my first play, I don’t know what I’m supposed to do… Am I supposed to just take the damage and or do I wait for the base? Sure, the second time I play the scenario, I’ll know what to do. But this is not an ideal way to engineer Legendary modules; Players want to know what their subgoals are.

While Legendary isn’t totally a beer and pretzels offering, this particular set might appeal to a more casual audience, or at least sci-fi fans who don’t play Legendary.  I think they spun the complexity in the wrong direction; It’s not TOO complicated, but it is more complicated than Marvel Legendary. It just doesn’t flow as smoothly, while not upping the payback. 

The rulebook also has some unclear explanations. Brothers in Arms, for instance, reads as though you can activate it anytime, resolving its effect independently of when the card is played. Most Legendary effects activate when you play it, so order of play matters.  The structure is a mess as well, compounded by the inclusion of 2 games. 

Finally, the game balance seems swingier than Marvel Legendary. A lot of the card power is very contingent on when the card appears, even moreso than other Legendary designs.

In general, whole thing feels whipped together on a tight budget. It needed more time to bake.

[b]8: Very good game. Rarely disappoints me. High on my request/recommend list.[/b]

Very much enjoy playing this solo (Using 2 avatars).  Simple to learn, hard to win, tells a good story. Have yet to win the first movie. Very thematic, art is excellent, you can see the movies playing out before you. Not rated as highly as LE: Alien because there's not as many scenarios out of the box compared between the two. Disclaimer: I love the Predator franchise, have read all the Dark Horse comics, seen all the movies, etc. Hunting Aliens as the Preds is great fun too.

Great thematic deck builder. Abilities, enemies and strategies change between the movies. Objectives are fun and diverse and character decks build off each other in a fun way. The final boss in each movie is a completely different fight.

Predator mode is okay. Hunting your prey and competing for points is fun and immerses you into the role of a hunter.

The main downside is that long setup times and only two scenarios limit replayability.

No se entiende, tiene 2 juegos: 

uno que es como el Legendary Alien, que es el que esperamos la mayoría de los que lo vamos a comprar, porque tenemos el de Alien, sabemos de que va y lo que nos vamos a encontrar. 

y el segundo que es como el Legendary de Marvel,que se juega igual que al de Marvel, y que si buscaramos el de Marvel no compraríamos el LEGENDARY ENCOUNTERS, sino el LEGENDARY MARVEL,  que es un juego que se resume en barajar, contar arañazos y estrellas y cambiarlas por puntos, sin dar mas de si...

Conclusión: la parte de Predator Encounter es de 10, aunque con las nuevas habilidades se hace más fácil de ganar, y encima solo lleva la mitad de misiones y pj del Alien;y la parte de Legendary marvel predator que es malo no lo siguiente, encima sin ninguna dificultad para matar a los humanos.... 5

No me ha defraudado para nada, lo único que hecho en falta es una mejor interacción con el de Alien, o haber añadido mas películas del universo Predator.

Not quite as good as Alien, but makes for an excellent companion game. Rather than having lots of scenarios, you're able to play both scenarios as either the cooperative humans or the competing Predators. Both ways are fun, though playing as the Predators feels very similar to how Marvel Legendary was early on; You don't really want to step on too many toes, even though you're undoubtedly looking out for yourself.

This rating may rise, but I found the first scenario really hard. I wasn't as invested in it as I was with the Alien game, but I think I find the Predator IP not nearly as interesting. It was fun, don't get me wrong, but I liked the Alien version better.

We did play the other mode which was the Predator version. I really, really liked that one. You were guaranteed a winner and you had to make tough choices of dueling someone or fighting guys out on the board. Brilliant gameplay and I would love to try that again.

I also would really like to combine this with Alien. I think it would be really freaking awesome. I do hope they have a better version of the compatibility pack though.

The co-op mode of this game is fun, and extremely similar to the Alien Legendary Encounters game (see those comments for more).

Competitive mode is ok, but not as good as co-op. Your ability to attack the other players directly is limited, and the game ends very soon after one player is eliminated so no one has to sit around and watch everyone else play. It feels a fair amount like Marvel Legendary, where you are trying to get more points than everyone else by being selfish about what you kill and when. It's a bit better than the Marvel version though, because it doesn't have that annoying tension of "Do I help the team this turn, or do I play selfishly and get an extra point or two?"

[u]Predator 1, co-op[/u]: 

2-player:EXTREMELY brutal and basically unbalanced in the 2-player mode. Much better in the 3-player mode.

[u]Predator 2, co-op:[/u]
The card combos seem to be a bit better in the Predator 2 Barracks deck. Worked great with three players and it was a bit more enjoyable than the Predator 1 co-op. It was a bit too easy with three players, I'll have to see how it goes in future plays. We could have been just lucky.

[u]Predator 1, PvP:[/u]
I don't want to play this with four players, unless people are experienced. The pace was a bit slow and downtime started to hurt. There is less control with more players. I think you should also first play without Tests because looking at them and keeping track of all the Tests slows down the game a bit. I think mixing the Barracks deck with jungle and urban could work reasonably if you choose the right decks.  

[u]Predator 2, PvP:[/u]
2-player: Victory for me: 30 points vs. 24 points.
This worked really well with two players. I also think the Prey deck worked much better. I liked it better than 3-player or 4-player PvP.


The co-op mode is excellent. Overall, I think three players is the sweet spot. With three players, the cards change in the Barracks deck much faster than in 2p-mode, it is easier to build a certain kind of deck. It also easier to Coordinate(and potentially more than one Coordinate card) and some cards become more powerful with more players.  There is a significant increase in Young Blood cards when you add the 3rd player, and it already helps the game quite a bit. I wonder how the 0 1 2 seeding is justified in the 2-player mode. Adding the 3rd player triples the Young Blood cards since the seed is: 2 3 4.

Final edit. This is a good game but building a powerful deck is VERY SLOW and getting powerful combos is close to impossible. Even if you are able to build a powerful deck, the combos are sub-par and nothing special. There are very few cards that let you destroy cards, so in essence your deck is full of crap through the whole game, and only getting lucky with your draws gets you a powerful hand. DC Comics Deck Building Game (with many expansions) has just so many incredibly cool combos and fun&crazy moments in every game. I also think that the replay value isn't that great in this version of Legendary system. Combining Alien Encounters is probably only way to add more life to game.

There is more coordination than Alien, which is good except in solo play.  The solo play has gotten a bit worse.  The game is much harder than Alien, which sounds thematic and tense but I found it to not work.  The game does not have enough choices and it has a lot of luck -- combined with a high difficulty, it just feels like going through the motions until you get lucky or die.  That's boring and mildly frustrating, not strategically tense or immersive.

Played the "first movie", which played... just like the first movie of Aliens. Essentially, you take out a guerrilla camp, and have to fight guerrillas and multiple, different Predators which... didn't happen in the first movie. If you must own a Legendary game and prefer Aliens, pick up Aliens. If you must own a Legendary game and prefer Predator, pick up Predator. If you you're not a fan of the Legendary game system, don't buy either.

*****

Predator's a *little* more interesting because (or when) your first opponents are humans, then latter ones are different Predators. It's like you stumbled into a frikken' Predator training ground. Oh, and since everyone in the first Predator movie pretty much died (LOL SPOILER) I didn't care whose name was written on what card in the deck. IIRC, The titles are great since many are quotes from the movies.

I enjoy the Legendary Encounters games as solo games. Predator so far seems a little bit more difficult than Alien. I can't wait to mix the sets and play Alien vs Predator.

The coop half of the game is tense and exciting just as it was in alien, but the competitive mode is great. I've been looking for a deck builder that was directly adversarial for a long time. I thought I had it with thunderstone before but now I know this is the one.

I am not a fan of Marvel Legendary, but I found that the theme of the Predator movies comes through quite well in this game.

RATING: 6
The main issue I have with this game, is the tendency for it to swing one of two ways - either the players get setup quickly and destroy all enemies before they get close, or one big enemy turns up early and kills everyone.

The game is very thematic. There's plenty for a Predator fan to like. But as a game, it doesn't quite do it for me.

In terms of the components, the artwork is good, but I'm not keen on the play mat. It feels nice, but the artwork isn't cleanly defined. I'd prefer the sharper artwork of a proper board.

Well, looks like this game has the same problem as Legendary Encounters Alien - it's missing cards and they are badly sorted out. Looks like Upper Deck could do some adjustments in this department "/

Great game. Difficult but a ton of fun. I play solo often and enjoy it. I have yet to beat the predator, but took home "small" victories by "Getting to the choppa"!!

Love the movies and theme, just don't enjoy the mechanics of the game very much.  I did get to the choppa, though!

I honestly struggle to work out what the appeal is of the Legendary games. The outcome is so random, with a huge stack of upgrade cards that may or may be useful, which may or may not combo, which may or may not bog down early with all the high value cards out (and no way to flush them), with almost no way to refine your deck, with huge swings of randomness in the damage deck etc etc. The theme does little for me and so this is honestly a pretty sad waste of a tree. Oh, and the artwork (presumably ripped straight from the Dark Horse comics) is awful and a complete mish mash. Lacking in development, graphic design, scaling. A total mess.

The co-op version here is slightly less annoying than Marvel Legendary which is just stupid beyond belief.

A kooperatív mód az Alien kicsit bonyolított változata, sokkal inkább egymásra utalva a játékosok, de nagyon hozza a film feeling-jét.
A komperatív pedig egyszerűen zseniális, nem elég a prédákat levadászni, de még arra is figyelj, hogy a másik mikor akar párbajra kihívni, vagy egyszerűen szó nélkül hátba döfni...

The Predators competitive mode is merely ok; it doesn't quite measure up to the co-operative game. The fact that there's only two movies in the box because the competitive mode is in there may hurt replayability long-term.

Great coop deck builder.  I played through with a group of friends over the course of a weekend.  After playing through the more narrative campaign of legendary encounters I found it hard to go back to normal legendary.

Fun deck builder. Does co-op better then Marvel (coordinate is great). Difficulty is not hard, but unfair. Lost due to a bad draw of wound (9 damage in 1 turn).

This game is very cool.  I am a huge fan of the predator series, in fact, it is my favorite alien movie of all time (along with the aliens franchise, of course).  I love playing this game through and it follows the movies.  I have played as humans and it is pretty tough that way.  I have played as predators and that is a bit easier, yet it is fun to battle other predators for honor.  Great game, has much replayability for a while, and is easy to teach.  Four thumbs up.  In my opinion, this is harder than aliens to beat.  Very thematic.

As much as I love the theming of the Legendary games, their setup always makes me hesitant to start a game.

OK, I added and graded this today, April 8th 2015. 
I have no idea when it is coming or anything. 
But I was FIRST. (How is that for cheeky interwebs?)

I think I like the mechanics of this more than the Aliens version. It seems to have a bit more player interaction. Plus, the minor wins are an interesting idea.

Game play is similar to the Aliens version but just not nearly as fun. At least when playing as the humans. Both movies you're just gathering clues and such and it feels like you're just drawing cards until the final enemy shows up and you try to kill it or run away. I've left each game unsatisfied. I have yet to play it as predators against other people (not co-op) so that has potential to redeem this game for me. But for the sake of playing the movies, Aliens is way better.

Upper Deck is on a winning streak with its Legendary movie licenses, as I liked Firefly and Alien much more than I should have.  These are part of the Legendary Encounters line, which are full-coops with special twists: coordination (the ability to play money/attack support cards on other players' turns), scanning of enemy spaces (enemies remain hidden otherwise), plot-based objectives, and thematic events from the original IPs.  These games have a real storyline - as much a deck-building game can have, anyway - beyond the nominal "schemes" of the non-Encounters games.

Predator is another Encounters release, and once again I enjoyed it more than expected.  Here, there are triggered bonuses for playing additional cards of the same character (Showboat), playing cards of different characters (Brothers in Arms), and receiving coordination support (Call for Backup).

Though, come to think of it, those might just be variants of mechanics already introduced in the Marvel games.  I won't tell if you won't.

Predator also has a competitive mode with a whole different cardset where - as the aliens - you're trying to collect the most human trophies, but you can also direct fire at other players (and potentially kill them) with Duel cards.  We haven't tried that mode yet, but it's up next.  If you're going to kill stuff, it might as well be everything under the sky, including your alien comrades - not just the pitiful pink-skins.

Sadly the inbox solo-play of the competitive mode is not so good ...

This is excellent!  A proper PvP mode and a way to hunt humans and aliens as a Predator is priceless.  A must have for an LE fan.

Brighter art and more tongue in cheek cards that feel more powerful and are more fun all round than Aliens Legendary. I look forward to playing as the Predators and to mixing the two sets together.

The Legendary Encounters series is fantastic fun. I really enjoy this one, even though I prefer the theme of the Aliens version. I also found that with the skills picked up from the Aliens set that the Predator version may perhaps be too easy. I won both my plays of this game, and without much of a sweat, especially our second play at the first film. Still, as far as deckbuilders go, Legendary Encounters rank close to the top.

This game is way too long for what it is. The final third of the game is the most interesting, but I really could have cared less.

If you auctioned off a group of three animals, and added the ability to make change, then this game might improve. I will probably not test these changes though, as once was enough.

The kids are having fun with this game after a few plays.  They like the auction,but naturally they don't think about how much an animal is worth before bidding.  So it's quite a free for all.  I think they (7 and 9) are still too young as yet.  

They do like the artwork, which is quite engaging.

We deal everyone 5 of the lower valued animal cards to start, to speed up the game.  It seems to make it about right.

Good bid game, very simple and fun. It is difficult to track the money of everyone and a necessary thing if you want to bid the right values. It has a chance that someone will overbid a card or pay too much for it unbalancing the money on the game, but overall a good game.

I am just horrible at auction games, this one is themed nicely and has cute art, and I think the cattle trade mechanic is an interesting addition, but I always end up feeling like pure auction games don't have much of a GAME there, it's more reading people and user generated content. To each his own, this one I can recommend as something fairly light.

+ Actually quite nice auction/bluffing game
+ Pulling off an animal from another player for just 10 bucks is rewarding, but on the other hand losing for the same profit can drive you mad ;)

i kind of enjoyed my first outing with it.  i don't mind the luck of the auction thing, but the whole cattle trading mechanic kinda sucked to me.  i would like to see something better in terms of bluff/antibluff.  as it stands, it seems like the only reasonable bluff call is to set a minimum loss/value and go for it, the only time it seems advantageous to accept an offer is if you think it's extremely high.  endgame needs work too.

I would probably consider this to be a very good game. But unfortunately, I'm horrible at it, so it makes me like it less (I'm really can never figure out how much to bid in this game for some reason). I think I just get too stressed out. I think bluffing games are just hard for me. My mom and wife like this game a lot, especially because of the goofy artwork on the cards.

Edit: This is actually a pretty fun game. We've taken it camping and had a great time with it.

RATING: 8
A clever card game with simple rules, lots of interactions. You have to trade animals with different values. 
The best part of the game imho when the players try to "steal"  the animals from each other by a kind of double blind bid. Very good feeling when you get the animal for "peanuts".

If you dislike games with lots of auctions you might as well forget about this game right away.  However I find the auctions fun and tense.  It's also cool to see how the prices get inflated as players get more and more money in their hands.  But the real genius of this game is the cattle trades, and the endgame scoring.  I think the fact that having 2 or 3 sets of animals multiplies your score is brilliant because it makes a minor collection more powerful.

It's cool that players are encouraged to trick their opponents with terrible offers and use them to steal the animals.  I love those moments when you're sitting there trying to deduce whether your opponent has offered you garbage or something worthwhile.  And then if you decide to counter-offer you have to decide how much is enough without being too much.  My only complaint about the game is that it seems a little bit too long.  Still I can see this becoming a go-to game for the youth and some of my friends who enjoy bluffing games.

Simply a classic. Played it first time, when I was a kid. Then forgot all about it until 2003. And immeditaly, I was hooked again. I just like the tension, when making the hidden bid and the nagging question in my head "Did I put enough money?" or "Did I offer too much?".

After first play...what an odd little beastie. Played it with some non-gamers (two of them over 60), and it went over very well. Though we didn't play in a terribly nasty way, I got the feeling that  one could be wicked if one wanted to. If we were playing it right, the auction mechanism is kinda funky - but that just makes me want to play it again and see what I could do to manipulate the system. I'm up for a few more games, at least.

Second play went over well (different type of group altogether). Laughingly cutthroat. Fun...but it is just a tad long. Thinking of trying the variants suggested that shorten things a bit.

Roppant szórakoztató játék, könnyed hangulathoz.
5 játékos: Hosszan tartott a játék, mivel folyamatosan vásároltuk el egymástól az állatokat és bizony itt nagyon fontos az, hogy mikor adunk ajánlatot egy megvásárlásra. Rengeteget nevettünk rajta. Előkerültek az irreális ajánlatok is az árverés során. Ahhoz képest, hogy kártyajáték, inkább a szerencsés döntések szabják meg a játék szerencsefaktorát nem pedig a kártya felhúzása, mivel azok megszerzését is mi döntjük el. Csak ajánlani tudom mindenki e remek és egyszerű játékot.

Fun and socially stimulating but can overstay its welcome : one hour and a half with 5 players is too much for such a light game. The first players who have completed their groups of animals have to sit and watch the other players finish the game sometimes over 20 minutes. But still, this is a lively bluffing game with funny artwork. A german game which makes people shout and laugh, that's refreshing.

Components: Art reminds me of that of a cartoonist for the New Yorker; the animals are cute, the money works adequately.

Experience: Very tough game of money management. It's tricky to spend enough to buy the animals I want, but retain enough cash to defend against a cattle trade. The endgame can be boring for those who have already completed all their sets, and chaotic for those involved in three-way competitions for a single animal.

It works with 3 and even better with 4 or 5 players. For 2 or 6 players there's a different (Master) version available, which I've purchased as well and traded away this one.

You're Bluffing is a game I've owned for years, long before I played Skull or Cockroach Poker or Coup. It may have been my group but I really loved the game. It takes the standard bluffing formula and really builds a game around it that gets you engaged. The bluffs feel so well played too. I won't go into detail but basically, you can hand someone a card and say it's the largest denomination and in fact it's just a 0 and they will just take it if you plan it right. The only downside is that at some point, if someone gets the 2 largest animal sets, there is usually no way to win so you can just fold the game up if nobody cares about runner up positions, which is what we did so we could play another round.

RATING: 5.75
Rated after 1 play @ 3 players.

You start by calling out a player's livestock that you'd like to take and then go into a secret bid with that player. Highest bid takes the animal and the previous owner takes the money. Very poker like in that the game is about reading people and trying to not overcommit too early. It was fun but didn't blow me away.

RATING: 8
"You're Bluffing" card game - lots of interaction with auctions, and lots of room for bluffing in "cattle trade" deals.  As an added bonus, it will please both children and adults.

It can drag on longer than the recommended time, but it can be tremendous fun with the right people, and is a great mix of bidding and bluffing!   To speed up the game somewhat: 
1. Players begin with four cards each, (possibly chicken, a goose, a cat and a dog to eliminate luck) (reference: [thread=779733]this thread[/thread]).
2. Players auction two animals at a time (reference: [thread=22203]this thread[/thread]).
I recommend playing with both of these, and then it makes the game weight feel just right for the weight.  See also [thread=1525399]this great article[/thread] by David Thompson about variants.

Note that the original German rules require that amounts bid in a "cattle trade" remain secret and are not announced afterwards, unlike the later English rules.  See discussion:

A lot of fun. I don't think I'd like it much with only 3 players, but with 4 or more it's great. I don't see people accept blind offers very often, so the cattle trades usually end up being won by whoever offers the most money.
I wish it was a bit shorter for what it is though. I would rate it higher if it played in 30-45 minutes.

RATING: 6
[Ravensburger's "You're Bluffing!" English edition] Game of auctions and bluffs. Players are trying to complete as many sets of animals as possible, with the highest values that they can manage. Auctions are open, targeted offers ("horse trades") for other players' animals are blind. Kuhhandel is *not* a filler. It runs for 60 to 90 minutes, and there are lots of tough decisions due to the closed economy and the blind trades. It's a decent choice for groups that like games with bluff. Play time can be cut down with simple setup and auction variants. Don't like it with five players (too chaotic) but is pretty good with three and four. (Most of my variants work best with three and four.) Pretty good value for its price point.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Just fun! I always fall for the commodity/money theme and love auctions and this is a step up from fillers. Only thing I don't appreciate: having to utilize my memory to remember how much who has. 

For non-gamers, randomly dealing out 4 cards to each player at the start really makes the game go quicker.

Quite a good little bluffing game - definitely not as light as the packaging would make it appear.  It can take well over an hour, and it requires some long-term planning to succeed at.  There are lots of "gotcha!" and heartbreaks moments in the cattle-trade phase where I can offer a load of undisclosed money to acquire your animal, but if you guess that and offer me just a tiny bit more, you get my matching animal for next to nothing.  Played with the right people, this can be a blast.

It's highly social and therefore a lot of the fun depends on whom you're playing with, but it surely doesn't fall into the metagame category.

Need to play this more to understand the values of the cards, but it seems that in bigger groups whoever wins the horse will most likely win the game, as all people will try to get at least one of the top tier animals.  Interesting judgements on what to pay for things, as paying too much leaves you vunerable to losing a valued card in a cattle trade.  Low rating is based upon not playing with a group that has familiarized themselves enough with the game - fairly sure this will rise.

UPDATE:  I was wrong about this one.  Although the basic game is decent, with other games offering similar ideas but providing more fun, I have had to lower my rating.
I also have to agree with other people in adding that it does feel like it takes too long for what it offers.

The best auction game - one of the few &#039;auction&#039; games that actually proceeds like a real, open auction. Once a lot is up for auction, there is no turn order, and anyone can bid as much as they can afford, at any time. Players have to be of the vocal type, and willing to run auctions in a quick efficient manner. People say this game takes a long time, but it doesn&#039;t have to. If 3 seconds goes by with no bid...the auctioneer should be starting with &#039;going once, going twice...etc&#039;.

A game with lots of laughter, with 3 players it can be a tactical game, with 5 it's more of a crap shoot, but none the less it's still much fun. The first phase - when there are still animals to be actioned - is the better part, because in the end most of the bids can be deducted. But that's a minor detail important to become the winner and with this game winning is just a bonus :)

I think the only complaint I have about this game is its length.  I think that the next time I play it, I'll remove some of the lesser valued animals from the deck to allow us to move through the whole game faster.  Pretty great bluffing game though.
---
Reading the forums (and the rule book, actually) taught me a shortened version of the game where all players start with 4 animals. This definitely sped the game up, and the double animal auction will definitely be used next game so that the game play centers around the brutal "bluffing" involved in the cattle trades.

I think I have got the hang of this game.  I think it is mostly in the trading rather than the auctions.  In fact dealing out some of the animals to start with doesn't hurt game and shortens it usefully.

Because of the cartoon style illustrations people don't take it seriously, which is good because if players are too uptight they won't be willing to trade and bluff -- which is where the fun is.

Farm animal selling and trading game through open auctions. Although it sounds typically Euro, the game is actually quite smart and interesting. Since there's a bluffing element in the trading phase, hilarity ensues whenever a player got conned into selling their animals for cheap. I didn't like the animal values though. The jump in values feels very arbitrary so it gets harder to value the animals.

"koehandel"
ontleend Bokkensprong augustus 2014. Blufspel waarin je kwartetten moet verzamelen van dieren. Bij een volledig kwartet verdien je de punten die erop staan, en op het einde vermenigvuldig je die nog eens met het aantal kwartetten dat je hebt kunnen verzamelen. Iedereen start met hetzelfde beginkapitaal. Als je aan zet bent, kan je ofwel dieren veilen aan de meestbiedende (als veilingmeester heb je wel steeds voorkooprecht), ofwel een koehandel starten. Bij koehandel doe je een geheim bod op een dier van iemand anders van een soort die je zelf ook al hebt. De tegenspeler kan het bod aanvaarden, of een geheim tegenbod doen. Leuker dan je zou denken.

21/09/2014 gekocht (7 EUR) op tweedehandsbeurs bij bordspelkampioenschap Winning Movez in Lokeren (zelf niet deelgenomen). December 2014 cadeau gegeven aan grootmoe, zomaar.

Biggest problem is the length as it takes a long time to accumulate cards and start trading. Need to try the alternate rules and hand out some animal cards to folks at the beginning.

Kuhhandel was one of those games that left me with a feeling that there must be more to the game than I noticed.
This changed when we altered the rules so that instead auctioning the animal cards one by one, we now auction them two at the time. This adds a lot of speed to the game and makes bidding a lot more interesting. It will also give a lot more trading between players since the cards are scatered around a lot more.

I like it better now using the fast start rules. (Everybody gets 4 random animals. Have yet to try another varient I've seen where everybody gets a fixed stable of animals to start.)

Fun, light auction game. About the same depth and quality of For Sale, but with a longer play time. Scales down in number of players a little better. I like having to weigh the value of an animal against the money I'd have left for future auctions and trades. Without the ability to make change, each card is valuable - low numbers more for the flexibility they give you than the $$ amount.  Good stuff.

Juego de faroleo en el que se subastan animales y se trata de conseguir las cuatro cartas de la misma especie.

Very funny game with very enjoyable art.  The bluffing is great and can really make you second guess yourself.  Inevitably the game drags a little at the end.  Some players will just be out of it for the last few turns, which is a bit of a minus.  Also, the high numbered suits (like the cow and horse) almost seem unbalanced, but maybe that's because of how new players play.  As long as the game moves quickly, You're Bluffing is quite fun!

In the realm of zero-sum-ish auction games I think this one slots itself in somewhere between Blindes Huhn and Neue Heimat, though I don't yet know whether it tilts towards the upper or the lower part of that range. Its distinguishing elements include currency inflation, which is triggered at random intervals; inability to make change, which somewhat counteracts the inflation; and special blind auctions between two players which happen primarily towards the end of the game but can also be triggered for an opportunity cost to capitalize on someone's lack of liquidity. I thought you had to play a game before you had any idea about valuation, but the economy evolved surprisingly quickly and smoothly... even if that doesn't mean we were playing anything close to optimally. It is possible to recover from early miscalculations, but also to land yourself in a situation where you know you can't win well before the game is over.

Fun cardgame. You have to collect 4 cards of a kind but instead of guessing players instead bid on the card that has been revealed from the deck. Each turn a card is revealed by one player and when the bids are over the winner takes the card and pays the player that turned the card over. Winner is the player that scored the most points.

Interesting game. The bigger bills that come into play make this game so hard to read.Skilled players are in the advantage. Trade with the least skilled player first to have a big advantage. BTW a high number of money cards keep your opponents guessing. Have at least the highest bill in your possesion. You will need it to make the game winning quartet. 

I am not sure about this game. In todays play the person who became last had a chance to be guarenteed third. - in the bidding roundd prior to the last. instead he opted to be last putting me in third spot instead of winning.   HE could have won the horses for a thousend points but  wasn't interested in them and collected money through them  to beat me by a whiskar on the goats. so he had 350 instead of a thousand. I allways play to be in the highest spot possible. ...

I don't usually like games, where are included blind-biddings. That's one of the main reasons, why I don't like Kuhhandel, but unfortunately there are other problems too: 1) The last trades before the game ends are stupid ones. 2) Too wide gap between the cheapest animal vs. the most expensive animal -> you don't want to spend money to the cheaper ones because you can't win if you have only them.

There are so many better bidding-games than Kuhhandel is (for example High society/Einfach Tierisch), so I don't have a "room" for this game at all.

This game is quite simple, nice-looking, fast and very smart. What else could you wish for in a light-to-middle-weight title? Again I ascribe the relatively low rating more to the low popularity of the game, than its quality. I HIGLY recommend this title although the German name "Kuhhandel" (Cow Trade) is nicer IMHO, since "You're bluffing!" implies something very abstract. This isn't the case! You're auctioning farm animals after all! =)

We dealt out animal cards to make. a shorter game and it still overstayed its welcome, especially so since it seemed like the winner was determined a few bids before the end.

The bidding for the animals is straight-forward and works well, but the blind-bidding during cattle-trading seems somewhat strange.  Maybe it will make more sense after more plays.  Hrm, no--downgrading a bit for length/weight ratio.

Laughs abound when someone wants to pay way more than face value for some of the low-value animals (like geese) in order to complete a set.

Clever twist is that money in your hand at the end of the game is un-scored, so don't be afraid to spend big to get what you need the last couple of transactions.  People keep their money hidden, so if you can deduce how much they have, it is to your advantage.

RATING: 7.5
Great bidding and bluffing game but with lots of trading going on it can last for an hour or so, which is too much for such a game. I like the variant (official one in Ravensburger version) where you auction 2 cards instead of 1 (trading remains the same). It doesn't change anything about the game, it just makes it much faster and will probably make you wanna play 2 games in a row.

The constraints on the money deck make this game interesting.  They also make it rather easy to keep track of who has what resource, since the blind bids are announced after each horse trade is completed.

This game is awesome! Kindof reminds me of a lighter, faster-playing version of Santiago; there is a bit of a screw-you element, but wrapped in a bidding/bribbing which makes it go down so nicely even as a familly game. No downtime, and some interesting strategies... I really like this game.

Tossing around bids back and forth wasn't really my idea of a good time.  The mechanics seemed either too abstract to me, or I simply couldn't bring myself to understand how to bluff better.  Almost as if playing a poker-style game for no money... I felt no compelling need to try hard.

Pretty neat! A nice game of auctioning and bluffing, with plenty of thinking involved: controlling your money is very important and plays a big role. The game is perhaps a tad long for what it is, but I don't know, I can see my rating going up with further play. I had the Finnish Lehmänkaupat edition: what a silly big box for just few cards.

Kuhhandel was one of those games that left me with a feeling that there must be more to the game than I noticed.
This changed when we altered the rules so that instead auctioning the animal cards one by one, we now auction them two at the time. This adds a lot of speed to the game and makes bidding a lot more interesting. It will also give a lot more trading between players since the cards are scatered around a lot more.

Kuhhandel ist noch so ein Spieleklassiker aus meiner Kindheit. Die Spieler wollen 4 gleiche Tiere ersteigern, um Punkte zu erlangen. Ein Spieler pro Runde ist immer der Auktionator und verkauft ein einzelnes Tier. Die anderen Spieler legen verdeckt Geldkarten als Angebot, darunter können unterschiedliche Beträge, bis hin zur "0" sein, eben ein Kuhhandel. Das Artwork hat auch heute noch Charme und das Spiel bleibt ganz wtzig für Zwischendurch.

First impression: An mixture of card management, auctions and bluffing. You need to keep things balanced or you're either an easy target for some cheap swaps or you don't have enough animals to be a part of the game. I think the mechanics are brilliant. This is one of those games I have no idea how they should be played but I'd definitely want to try again.

Exhilarating card game where players need to gain the best sets of animals in the farm through auctions and trades, naturally not negotiated but blind and forced by the player who wants to rip you off.

A fine little card game.  Certain decisions are forced upon you at certain times.  First-timers (like me) can make terrible decisions before learning the economic system.  I like the blind bluffing half of the game, and enjoy the beginning of it (when there are more options) much more than the end, when decisions are made and the game is mostly decided, and there's an element of king-making, as someone who can throw all of his/her money to buy, say, a 160-point dog throws off the money curve when 1000-point horses are still up for grabs.

Far more intense than I had imagined!  I'll have to play more before I even begin to get a handle on how to value cards in the acquisition phase, and the challenge phase can be tense and exhausting.  Lots of fun this first play.  Edit:  have played several times sense, and grow in my appreciation of its capacity to simulate open market valuation.  On the other hand, I don't find it a ton of fun -- too stressful!

I've played Wrott & Swindlers which is almost identical in design and play except in You're Bluffing you can do trades if you own part of a visible quartet, instead of auctioning a flipped card. This removes the monotony of continual auctions in W&S and makes for interesting tradeoffs which are revealed. The other differences in YB from W&S(as far as I can recall) are that: a)you can accept the trade without a counteroffer; b)two equal trade offers result in the trade being free; and c)the presence of bluffing cards. I was hoping that the humour inherent in the last two factors would occur in our first play but I think we weren't canny enough in our trades for it to occur. But what puts me off playing this game again, despite its interesting and fun potential, is the inaccessible, boring scoring of mentally unwieldy values to add and multiply. Why couldn't single/low double digit values be used(as these are conditioned in us simple folk)to make assessment of player status easier and so plays would be more meaningful, so we don't have to work so hard for our excitement?

A very simple yet elegant auction / bluffing game about collecting sets. However the crux lies in the fact that you offer a number of cards (yet the actual value remains hidden). Lovely little gem.

EDIT: Burned out a bit on it after only half a dozen plays. Still a nice game but there are a few 'tricks' and 'loopholes' which ca quickly annihilate new players and I think those mechanics could have used some more playtesting and tweaking. Also,the game plays very similar each time. 

EDIT2: Played this again after quite some time and somehow it always plays the same and follows the same pattern. Unfortunately I feel there are quiet a few loopholes of strategy in the game that can be exploited by experienced players.

Great auction game.  Horse-trading and the lack of change make this a very simple but clever auction game.  Good with kids or with gamers. My strategy hint is to never horse trade unless it will seal a set of 4 for you - it is always better to launch an auction and get the money.

Use the German rules, they play a bit faster.  The weaker player can often play kingmaker, so there is a bit of diplomacy.  (I am going to crush you, but HE is the one you are pissed off at...)  However, in Poker, perhaps 2 or 3 times in a 5 hour session you get a nail biting show down.  In this game you get that feeling several times in a 1.5 hours.  Recommended.

Excellent bluffing game.  Sources of (fun) frustration include the inability to make change, the craziness of horse deals, opponents who have excellent poker faces.  Took over an hour to play, which I feel is a little too long for a game of this weight.  I guess the length was due to the strange sense that somehow you could analyse your way to a correct answer to horse deals, though in reality analysis seemed to lead nowhere.  Nevertheless, it was much fun, with lots of laughs, implosions, slapped foreheads.  If the game can be made to play faster, it will go up in my esteem.  UPDATE:  Now I play the variant where 2 cards are flipped per auction.  The playing time now matches the weight!  2nd UPDATE:  The more I play with this variant, the more I like it.  The game is a agonizing ride for everybody, so everyone commiserates while being competitors.  Simple rules, and has an analytical/psychological mix that few other games have.  Bumping up from 8 to 9.

26-01-2015. I rated this after 1 recent play, but I have played this in the past quite a bit.

I do like Koehandel, which is the dutch version of you're bluffing! In this game you are buying animals and trying to get sets to score points. If you do not yet have the whole set, anyone who has that animal too can make you an offer for yours. The bidding is blind (and money cards include zeros..) so you are not sure who wins the bid.

I think it's good, but the rats and the bonus cards from the 'master edition' I didn't really like.

Rigolo au début, mais j'ai vite déchanté. Kuhhandel est un jeu d'enchères pratiquement pur, assez dynamique et bien illustré. Les enchères « à la foire » génèrent une bonne ambiance, mais c'est beaucoup trop long ! Du coup, l'ambiance a tendance à s'éteindre avant la fin. La phase d'enchères reste très équilibrée, mais il n'y a pas beaucoup de mérite : la loi du marché fait que les mécanismes d'enchères ont tendance à s'équilibrer tout seuls… Et comme il n'y a aucun contrôle ou spéculation comme à [gameid=118], le jeu a plutôt tendance à tourner tout seul pendant cette phase.

Puis arrive la phase de bluff, et là c'est un peu le grand n'importe quoi. Elle se résume à une partie de pierre-papier-ciseaux qui va sceller le sort d'une heure d'enchères. Au final, c'est plus frustrant qu'autre chose…

Bon, je retourne à [gameid=118].

A bluffing game should introduce mechanisms which let you choose from several courses of actions, of which which is the best depends on your assets, secret to other players, but which they can try to guess basing on your chosen actions. What's more, it should be possible to - given some assumptions - estimate the probability of whether an action is a bluff or not, if only roughly. Poker (in newer variants) is a great bluffing game, Liars' dice is another. [i]You're Bluffing![/i] is not. The supposed bluff here is placing a blind offer for other player animals. You can accept it, and turn over the animals for which the offer was made, or make a counter offer, in which case each player gets the opponents' money, but the highest offer takes also the animals of the opponent. The problem is there's virtually no information to estimate the amount of the offer - you know only how many cards where offered, but they come in a huge variety of nominations.

Good, light bidding and bluffing auction game unlike your run off the mill bidding game due to a couple of factors, such as fixed currency denominations with no change. Simple rules. Not to be taken too seriously - a good ride just to enjoy - make sure to really push the speed of the auctions to keep it interesting. "Going once, going twice, SOLD!"

If Hail Mary blind bidding is not your thing then steer clear of this game, because your whole game can turn on one blind bid.

Deal the first four cards to each player for a quicker start, or auction off two cards at a time (tends to lower the number of early kuhhandelen though, as players need their auction income).

All in all I prefer Magellan - for a similar mechanism, without the blind bidding.

Players take part in animal's auctions trying to get the most points out of it.  They can start a bidding or propose a trade to a rival, with a smooth mechanic in which bluffing have a major role.  Nice filler that is usually liked by everbody and very easy to teach.

The first part of the game is fun, but the towards the end it's tedious because everyone pretty much knows how much money everyone else is holding. So the bluffing aspect, which is really the only strategy in the game, goes out the window. However, it's easy to learn and quick to play. And everyone likes to play auctioneer!

Bought this a few years ago, tried it once, nobody liked it. So I've brought it with me, to try it out. I got a group of gamers willing to give it a go. But I've tried one of the "fast" variants to shorten the length of the game - 2 animals got auctioned at once. The variant worked well, I'm just not sure of the game. It's pretty opaque as far as trying to win goes - auctions, bluffing, buyout of other players,  money entering the game while playing (which needs to be considered as well). It might be that I would need to play it more with a more casual group, but at the moment things are so opaque it's more of a ride than playing to win. The way it all mashes together is kinda clunky, flow of the game uneven, so my impression was: a shorter Monopoly.

I do like it more than before, but For Sale, or even Felix the cat in the sack are better. As they're more focused.

45 min. my ass.  This is a great filler game that well overstays its welcome.  I'd love to play this again where it actually would be 45 minutes.  Supposedly, if you deal out some cards first it helps.  Still, I think that there are some serious endgame problems.  Everyone knows who's going to win (or at least who is most definately not going to win a least 15 min before the end of the game.  WAAYY too long.  Perhaps if the game ended when you ran out of cards as well, that would help.  I don't know, I would just much rather play Pizzaro & Co, I feel it utilized the changeless money/card mechanic so much more efficiantly.

Underrated bidding and bluffing game with shades of Modern Art. The genius of the game is that the auctioneer can pay the highest bidder to buy whatever is up for auction. This ensures that prices are at or near the true value while allowing the auctioneer to choose between giving or receiving money to an opponent, significantly affecting the distribution of cash between the two, and altering both the buying power of the opponent and the incentive structure of the table.

[FX Schmid 'You're bluffing' 2nd (2002) edition] {Animal; bluffing, bidding, set collection; optimal 5p} {basic game 5.5; shorter-game variant: 7} It would be a nice auction game if it's not too long. It's a tactical game; some planning is needed but it's difficult to have a long-term plan due to the randomness of the game. The bluffing element is particular interesting. Time of play is independent of number of players and it's more fun when more players are involved in the horse-trade.

Variants shall be used to shorten the game; otherwise, the game turns will be repetitive and makes the game bored.

Very simple to teach but playable on many levels.

tl;dr: enjoyable but too long

The box for this game says 45 minutes. With 4 new players we went through about 60% of the deck in an hour. And the game doesn't end then. I'm not sure if it is actually possible to do it in 45 minutes.
At 45 minutes I would say this is a fun auction game with a fun element of trying to pry as much money from the other players as possible (auctions are 0 sum). But the game should be over in 45 to 60 minutes. Longer is too long for me.

Amikor elfogytak a licitálásra váró lapok és a játékosok egymástól próbálják megszerezni a hiányzó állatokat, már nem annyira az üygeskesédsen és a blöffölésen múlik, hanem azon kinek van több pénze. Mi ahányszor csak játszottunk mindig figyelmmel tudtuk kísérni kinél mennyi pénz van nagyjából, így különösebb meglepetés nem ért minket. Szerintem jobb lenne, ha a játék végén a megmaradó pénzt is pontokra lehetne váltani, mert így az utolsó körökben meg kellene fontolni mennyit is ajánljak a hiányzó állatokért. Különben pedig beadom az egészet és viszi az állatot akinek több van bent.

Simple auction game with a repetitive structure, but there's still a lot to like here.  Several of the suggested tweaks are necessary to make this shine and are somewhat group-dependent.  Starting with four cards per player and auctioning two at a time seems like an absolute must.  Allowing overbids and keeping all bids and payments secret works best for us.  Allowing counter-bids seems to stretch the game too long.  See [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1525399/choosing-rules-variants-your-group]my analysis[/url] for more details.  There is still some potential for king-making with a player who is out of the running, but with the variants above, the game shouldn't be long enough to make that a serious issue.

RATING: 7
I actually played the German version of this game which has the much more awesome name of KoeHandel, or Cow Trade.

The goal of the game is to get the most points by collecting sets of 4 animals of a type. The deck is made up of various animals, but each animal only has 4 cards. Some animals are better than others, a set of 4 chickens is worth 10 points while a set of 4 pigs is worth 650 points. But... your final score is multiplied by the number of complete sets you've won. (At the end of the game there will only be complete sets)

Players start with a hand of money cards. Denominations are a thing in this game as you can't make change. Each player on their turn has one of two options, flip a card and auction it, or start a cow trade.

When you flip a card other players bid on it. When you are ready to close the bidding the auctioneer says "Going once... going twice... going three times!" and at that point can either, take the money from the winning bidder, or pay the bid amount to the winning bidder and keep the card for himself. Whoever wins the card puts it face up on the table in front of themself.

If there are two players who both have cards from the same animal set, then one of them can initiate a cow trade on their turn. To initiate a cow trade you identify the animal and person you want to trade with. You select some cards from your hand (which include 0 money cards) and put them on the table hidden by your hand (you can even bluff and put no cards). The value of these cards are not visible. Then the person either accepts your offer, or counters your offer with a bid on your matching animal. Whoever offers the higher amount wins the card from the other player. If both players have a pair of cards, then the trade must be for pairs. At the end of the game, when the deck runs out, people must cow trade all the unfinished sets until only complete sets exist.

The game seems simple enough at first glance, but it's really very strategic. You have to be careful not to let other people get too many cards, but if you're buying cards you'll be cash-poor and ripe for an opponent to swoop in with an aggressive cow trade. You want to bid low to get cards cheap, but then the auctioneer can simply buy it back cheaply. Bids get wonky as you run short of low bills. And weird situations happen where someone gets paid a ton of money, but it's all in large denominations and they suddenly can't bid easily unless they go in large. The game had a lot of non-intuitive consequences that surprised me. There is a bit of luck in that if you reveal the right cards on your auction turn, you can luck into a lot of money. That's a bit of a concern, but if you play this as a light game, not too bad. I could also see this being played at a much deeper level, but I'm not sure it would be nearly as fun that way.

About [thing=1117][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=1117][/thing] is a set collection game, in which players bid for sets of animals and can make deals on animals the other players have, if they also have the same kind of animal, but these deals can be filled with air, regret and bluffing. The goal is to have more points, and the animals have different values, but only when you have all the 4 cards of the same animal you will be able to score it at the game's end.

[thing=1117][/thing] offers a lot of player interaction, with the game going into a crescendo towards the late rounds, as everytime a Donkey card is revealed, every player receives money - so the bidding starts slow and accelerate towards the end.

It is a game that is both easy to teach and to play, however, due to the nature of it, as the highest bid (or offer) is paid to the player auctioning the animal, is possible for someone to overbid (or overpay) for an animal, throwing the balance of the game a little off - much like something that can happen in [thing=26990][/thing] in the blind bid. I don't think it can break the game, but is something to be aware of and warn the players at the start of each play.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
Players, in their turn, can do one of two things:
a) Reveal an animal card and put it to auction;
b) Make an offer on an animal someone has, provide the the player in turn also has the same kind of animal.

The auction is pretty simple: everyone can bid, in an open fashion (the is no turn order), and the auctioneer must start counting for the end of the auction when bids slow down. At the end of the auction, the auctioneer can either receive the money offered in the highest bid and give the animal card to that player, or pay the same amount offered to the highest bidder in order to keep the revealed animal card to herself. Then the turn passes to the next player, clockwise.

The deal between players is a little trickier and is the heart of the game. If you and someone else has the same animal, you can make an offer on that animal instead of auctioning a card. The offer made is secret: the player receiving the offer only knows the amount of money cards you are offering (and there are 0 money cards in the game), and she can't refuse the deal. What she can do is make a counter offer for [u]your[/u] animal. High bidder gets the other player's animal and, also, [i]both players keep the offer made by the other[/i].

The game ends when all the animals are in complete sets. The scoring works like this: add the value of each animal set you have than multiply it by the number of sets you have. So, say you have the Ox (800) and the Cat (90). Your score will be 800+90 x2 = 1880.

The player with the most points will be the winner.

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
When to auction and when to make an offer to someone else. Also, when other players make an offer to you, is time to consider making an counter offer or just accepting the money given.

When to auction is simpler: if you aren't sure you have enough money to win a deal, or simply is low on cash, you are better starting an auction, and hoping for a high value animal do appear. Staying capitalized is key in this game.

The toughest decision during the play is the offer and counter offer, as a normally costly animal can be taken cheaply if you offered 550 and the other 520, as it costed you only 30 to buy it! Therefore, from the original offer to the counter offer, there is a lot to be taken into consideration.

From my experience, the game is won not in the auctions, but in making great deals.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- High player interaction;
- Easy to teach and to play;
- Little downtime, as auctions occur often;
- Language independant;
- Small and portable, and the cards fit back in the box even with sleeves;
- Usually tense in the deals and decided near the very end.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- There is luck in the auctions: revealing a 1000 points Horse is bound to be much better than revealing a 10 points Chicken, as the auctioneer will gain much more money;
- Bad plays (overpaying) can affect not only the person that did the bad play, but also have ripple effects and cause imbalance in the game in later rounds;
- It works better with higher player counts - 4 or 5 -, which can be hard to achieve for some.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Like in the most mean animal show. You want to buy the cute animals, but others are always bidding in the same thing. Once you did buy one, someone comes and wants to buy it from you. You can't slap him in the face and say "it's family!". You have to agree in enter this back alley deal in which you can only feel the weight of the envelope, even though most of it can be white paper with the word "sucker" written all over it. It is hard to make a leaving in this wild west meest no man's land of animal business.

[thing=1117][/thing] works very well for what is proposes - it is light, interactive and offers a good deal of bluffing and second guessing. After the first play, we kept thinking about it, and a second play followed soon after. The game is tense until the very end, as. with competent players, the last deals will decide the outcome of the play, so there won't be a runaway leader (but, without care in deals and bidding, a player can be out of the contest clearly near the end).

Very unsuspected, [thing=1117][/thing] carved its way into the rotation of my gaming group, and I see a good future for it. Recommended.

I find it a bit too long. I'll generally only play it with the shortend version (deal 4 to start) and auction 2 cards at a time.

This is an artificially high rating, I know.

Strategy-wise, I'm underwhelmed. And if I really want a bluffing card game, I'll head to the poker table.

But I'm a little too serious. I do dry sarcasm very well, but I fail at being silly more often than not. I envy my brother his joy in making train noises during TtR -- I just don't have it in me, or I feel foolish doing it. I think my kids are somewhat deprived in this regard since their dad is more staid than silly as well.

Not with this game, though. My grandfather was an auctioneer, and this game hits me exactly right to tap into my deeply-suppressed silliness. I can compete with the fastest-talking trash-offering auctioneers around when we're playing this one. "We have a goat for sale, goat for sale, a lovely goat for sale. Sir, your wife looks like she would love a nice cashmere scarf, did I mention that this goat is straight from Mongolia?"

And my kids -- who don't cut loose around us as often as they do around their silly uncle -- join right in. They love trying to do the auctioneer role themselves, often foresaking the opportunity for a favorable cattle trade (because the other owner is low on cash at the moment)  just so they can do the livestock offering.

This game generates more unadulterated joy than any other in our household. For that reason, it gets a 9.5

Named "Koehandel" in Dutch. Exceptionally good four player card game. It is not about bluffing but more about planning and counting.

RATING: 2.5
Played "You're Bluffing" edition. Game length is too long. Too long downtime. Too few players involved each time. Not too much decisions/options. 
Poor candidate for new gamers. Never a favorite for veteran gamers (at least not me).
Never play it again. The worst game I have ever played since 2000.

You're Bluffing! - Very good bluffing, auction/trading set collection card game with great, funny artwork. Ends up with ridiculously overprized and reckless bids/trades after the initial stingy bids/trades with massive inflation during the game.

RATING: 6
This is a tight blend of mechanics, with hand management, double-bluff blind bidding, and a little bit of luck thrown into the mix.  It has a steep learning curve, but it's worthwhile -- there's a fun bidding game in there!  I can see this score going up with further plays.

The best auction game ever!  There is just the right amound of proper open bidding and bluffing to make this game just fun fun fun...

Do not play with "wrong" rules! Some of the games had bad rules for "kuhhandel"special trade. Ther right way to do this is player who starts gives the other player 1-x amount of money cards face down. Then that player either accepts OR gives back 1-x amount of money cards AFTER this both players take the money cards the other player offered and count them. Then pass the animals in question to the player who bid more! Both players keep the money they got from the trade!

zero amount of money is better than no money at all!
Also The player who wins allways wins the maximum amount of animals...so if both players had 2 winner takes all four and if one of the players had 1 then if he wins he takes 2.

Not much bluffing and a very obvious kingmaker problem. I'm clearly missing something with this game, but it's not inspiring me to find out what. I think people who like traditional card games and insane chaos would love this. I seem to be missing that gene.

I have the Dutch edition. I have played this game a lot before getting it. Since bluffing is crucial in success in this game and I am not that good at it ... I hardly ever try to convince people to play it.

Still if you like bidding (open and blind) you may like it as it is quite clever in its simplicity.

For trade!

An unusual game in our collection, as the minimum amount of players is 3. As we rarely play with more then two, we don’t buy games that can’t be played with 2. Why we own this? Well, we found a copy on the market, for 50 cents. Brand new, still in plastic. As we played this one ten years ago, shortly after we’ve met each-other, together with friends and we had lots of fun back then with this game, we could not leave it there. We just had to wait for an opportunity to play it again with somebody else.

Was it really that fun or was it the pink cloud we were sitting on back then? After reading the rules and watching a short tutorial video, I was sure it was the cloud. After playing, I’ll have to say, it really was that fun. Of course we’re more critical when it becomes to games these days, then we were in 2003, but we still see the perspective of the target-group where a game is designed for. A simple game with very little tactics and a lot of luck, can be a lot of fun, when played with the right group. If you play this with people who over-thinks and calculate every move they possibly could make, then it would be no fun at all. Great game if played with the right kind of people.

All of the above, might be incorrect, as now-a-days we’re still living on that same cloud.

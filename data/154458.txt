I find it to be a luck fest.
Unless you play poorly, it comes down to who gets the best bonus cards for the current game.
It's a good game and I wouldn't mind playing it again, but I found everything to be too random.

A non aggressive 2 player game about building island and temples; play time is a bit longer than what I would expect for the difficulty level, and the puzzle of matching the right color is not really a challenge. however, you always end up satisfied of what you have built. I am fan of the small boats that carry cubes on the board.

It looks compact from the box, but does not have a compact table presence.  

A nice little pickup & deliver game, but which fortunately removes a lot of the tediousness of standard pickup & deliver games because of the relative ease with which you can zip around the archipelago you are creating. 

That said, it doesn't "deliver" enough excitement to come off the shelf all that often.

1st play: This is a cool Pick Up and deliver mixed with an tile laying game. It reminds me of Tobago in that you're trying to lay down clues to create locations to excavate temples. The pick-up and deliver part is very quick, and straightforward. Overall a good 2p game

2nd play: Worth noting, this game being only for 2p hurts the rankings, but the game is very good still. Great production quality, and played the 2nd time must faster than the first. Tons of combos to pull off and varying goal cards ramp us in a satisfying way.

RATING: 9.3
Awesome game, a first-class 2-players. Basically a pick-up-and-deliver, but with a stock market mechanism (mild) and a really good puzzle aspect (strong). It has a nice rhythm that accelerates towards the ending. The objective cards are important and its possible to win even without having built all your temples.

RATING: 10
Wow! Akrotiri is such a beautiful and intricate game, tucked in a tidy box with no wasted space. Everything from the art design to the molded temples to the uber-clean mechanics (and the esp. handy reference card) scream quality and nuanced attention, and the low price makes buying this game a no-brainer. Akrotiri is one of the best dedicated 2-player games I've ever played. 

(My only gripe is that not all the cubes in my set fit in the boat properly, though turning them diagonally does the trick nicely.)

Provisional rating upped to 10: this is very probably a perfect design.

почитал правила. выглядит довольно любопытным сплавом Splendor и Ticket to Ride в античном сеттинге. модульная карта с ресурами, плаваешь по ней на корабле и собираешь ресурсы на продажу. для постройки храма нужно заплатить деньги и выполнить интересные условия особых карт (географического плана; храм должен располагаться между определёнными ориентирами). несколько разочаровывают разве что скучные карты тайных целей (доп. очки храмы, расположенные определённым образом). 

интересно, что игра была урезана с 4 игроков до 2, т.к. автор не нашёл другого способа справиться с даунтаймом.

Nice little two player pick up and deliver and build temples on islands game that is perhaps best enjoyed as a puzzle challenge as much as an interactive game.  Nice art, and somewhat interesting "trade route" Tsuro style lines that must be followed.  On my first play, I found it to be a little bit on the easy side, likely because I took maps that were too easy.  Overall, a pleasant gaming experience.

Nothing about this one impressed us during our play. The game feels like it moves at a snail's pace and there are no interesting decisions to be made during a player's turn. Referencing the map cards with relatively placement can be a real pain in the ass, but thankfully the conditions are so ridiculously easy to satisfy that it almost doesn't matter. Sold to make room in the collection.

RATING: 7
Small box with lots of Analysis Paralysis included. It seems simple. Just place a tile onto the table to expand the island chain around Akrotiri. But ... as the area grows larger and larger and you attempt to place temples among those islands (place six temples and you win) the choices become very wide and varied. Temples are placed according to resource locations on map cards you purchase. As more resources get placed through more tiles being played more options become available for placing temples. So very often you end up staring at the tile in your hand and at all the other tiles already placed trying to figure out if after placing that tile you can place your next temple. What starts out very simple soon becomes a brain burning puzzle. So beware ... it may be a small box. But it is not a small game.

Laying out tiles, acquiring and shipping resources, excavating temples, and attempting to meet secret Goal cards. An elegant, visually pleasing design, always have to love the little tokens that can carry cubes. I like the market management aspect, taking resources from the market tracks and then placing them back through shipping. Easy to score, fairly easy to learn, but you've got plenty of choices, and while I didn't like it as much as Belfort, it's nevertheless another victory for Jay Cormier and Sen-Foong Lim.

An outstanding big little game! It’s little in the sense that it is for two people and that the box is rather small. But big, in the way that you might actually have to expand your table to finish it. We sure had too! And it’s just a bliss to play it. Took rather longer to finish then first thought. Minus points for unclear instructions, but nothing internet did not solve. Definitely recomend!

RATING: 7
This game has flown under my radar and has come to impress me quite a bit. Mechanically, it has several working parts (pick-up-and-delivery, engine building, tile laying) that work together in a very fluid well. But it feels like a race where players must find the best ways to acquire goods (pick-up-and-delivery) in order to get money so that they can purchase/place temples (spatial puzzle). But as players place temples, they gain more actions. And lets not forget that the game board is constantly growing but movement in quite quick (unlike in many pick-up-and-delivery games). The end result is a game that quickly becomes brain-burning, as players have numerous options, yet doesn't slow down.


Simply put, this is a VERY good design and I wouldn't be surprise if my admiration of the game increase with more plays.

Nice two player (only!) game of pattern matching and pick-up-and-deliver, where the map is built by the players as the game goes on (and is therefore a different experience every time you play). A strong "brain-burn" element, especially in the early game as you try to complete all your map and goal cards, and then it ends before one of you is quite ready for it.

Not sure about this one. I wish there were a way for more of the information to be open without bogging down the game. As is, it seems unlikely that you can intuit the other player's map or goal cards. Thus, the only long-term planning you can do is for yourself. This makes what could be some heavy interaction into incidental screwage.

RATING: 7
While I really like and enjoy the gameplay, my girlfriend does not. It has to do with the spacial reasoning in the core mechanism - of understanding where a card actually allows you to build. 

This is not a failing of the game in any sense, but try this before you buy it! I think it is really good, and its great to see another game that uses logical reasoning (like Tobago) as a core mechanism, to go alongside the 'pick-up-and-deliver' economics.

Initial Impressions:
-----------------------
This one was very nice components for the price point.  The game looks great on the table, and has nice thick cardboard.  From a gameplay stand point I was pretty disappointed.  There were a ton choices to make, just not sure how many of them were interesting.  I didn't hate the game, but I didn't really feel like I was having much fun.  The game does induce a ton of AP, and can actually be pretty mean at times.  Nothing really new in this one, and I actually found some of the rule explanation to be pretty terrible.  Not really planing on keeping this one, especially since my wife didn't like it at all.

A solid exploration-y light/medium euro with a tile-laying puzzle aspect and the resource management (just money in this case) typical of eurogames.

I love it. Comfortable play time. Very easy to learn but plenty of strategic and tactical depth in this one thanks to goal cards and the ever-developing layout of the islands.

Recommended! Give it a shot! Great bang-for-the-buck game. The components are mostly wonderful (the player boards and market board are somewhat flimsy but everything else is top-notch!).

I had a really good time with this, would be willing to play most of the time. That said, I think one of the goal cards is OP, because it combos just a bit too well with another goal card, I ended up getting 30 points on those two cards alone, which seems a bit too much. I would have one without that second goal card still (for reference: the two away from center goal card and the not connected to the center goal card)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I'm not sure why I originally found this game so brain-burny.  It's definitely brain-burny, but probably not more than medium-weight.  That's still a lot given the small box and fairly simple rules.  Since the game clock is variable, there are multiple strategies (lots of quick, cheap cards vs. a few expensive ones) and the goal cards will often influence what the better strategy is.  There's certainly luck in the tile draws and the map cards, but I don't think it's that high.  

Very cool game.

As far as two player games go, this is a fantastic play. Component quality and design are fantastic, the game feels super solid and chunky and I love that about it. The game play is also a lot of fun, the only thing I'm not a huge fan of is the ambiguity with the rules when it comes to  placing temples. It could be clearer. Other than that hiccup I love this game. As a two player game it is one of the better games I've played. (In regards to actual board games not counting head to head games like MTG). Great pickup I would recommend.

Cool, smooth, pick-up-and-deliver game with some clever timing/efficiency mechanisms. Level 1 scoring cards can be completed quickly, opening up extra actions, but giving you relatively few points. The more difficult level 2-3 cards take more time, but can pay off in the end. The game really is about finding a balance between getting extra actions while scoring valuable cards, which is harder than it sounds.

Finally got a copy at my FLGS for a reasonable price. 

I like that this game is relaxed. The exploration and adding tiles was fun. Patricia didn't think the temple placement mechanism was too difficult or fiddly, and was buying medium and hard maps.

The game takes more table space that I thought - it didn't quite fit on a small coffee table at the boba shop.

I'm happy with the purchase.

Spatial Reasoning is not my forte. That being said, I really enjoyed this game.

The first time I played Akrotiri, I got stomped by my wife, who I suppose has a real knack for these types of strategy games. 

It has the hallmarks of a great game in the making

1) randomization so that no two maps are ever the same
2) multiple ways to win the game
3) Hidden agendas that don't stop the game when fulfilled, but count at the end
4) Different type of actions available per turn, so you don't feel like you're stuck doing the same thing over and over
5) Investing for the end of the game by paying now for the opportunity to get more points later in terms of "maps"
6) Appropriate game length that's not too long or too short.
7) Nifty progressive economic mechanics that make you want to find the scarcest resources
8) It also has a nice aesthetic design that I find appealing.

My only real compliant is that it's only a 2 player game.  The available pieces really limit this, but if someone comes up with a variant that somehow lets 3-4 total players join in I'd love to hear it.

Otro Z-Man y otro juego como una casa. Estupendo juego de exploración  y colocación de losetas para dos jugadores. Mecánicas de gestión de mano, pick up and deliver y puntos de acción.

Precioso el juego y fantástico diseño para dos jugadores. Muy recomendable. En breve reseña.

Akrotiri ofrece mucho en un tiempo muy contenido(unos 45min), no paras de darle al “coco” para ubicar tu tesoro en la isla adecuada, con un arte que me parece espectacular y unos componentes que no le van a la zaga. Todo ello a un precio muy competitivo. Como en los casi todos los juegos donde hay que rascar un poco para disfrutarlo, cuantas más partidas mejor. Totalmente recomendable para parejas jugonas.

RATING: 7
Very unique game (at least for me) with interesting mix of game mechanics. You need to gather and sell resources so you have money to buy maps and excavate temples. Placing tile every turn you have to watch the color symbols (do you want to place the red south or north?), the route you will create with it (you can gain access to new part of the world, or you can completely deny access to some island), the resource you will put on it (which type of resource should I use and where to put it so I can make benefit from it and not you) and lastly does the new tile gain me some advantage in my current map  set and goal cards?
After placing the tile and resources you have number of action depending on how many temples you have already excavated (move you boat, pick resources, sell them, buy new maps, excavate a temple, visit an oracle (choose tile with specific color). The game ends when somebody excavates sixth temple so it is kind of a race between two players.

What I like:
- I found the combination of mechanics very interesting there. Tile placement (where you have to check several indicators how to place the map tile), resource gathering (pick and delivery), and hand management (maps). What I especially like is creating the movement paths according to the tile placement and the interesting mechanics of the goods value according to the amount of it on the map
- game material is high quality. Temples are nice heavy, ships are cool and everything is nice to look at.
- This game is more thinky than I would assume. There are tons of decision each turn (where to put the tile, what action to get, prepare or find a best spot for excavating temple, handling your funds etc.).
- I like that this is very different and interesting duel game only which covers the unused corners of my game collection. It is very unique game among my other ones and plays very differently from other games I like. Also it fills the sweet spot between short filler and a long game (so far an average game was finished in 45 minutes setup included).

What I dislike:
- I didn't find the Goal Cards (or distribution of them) to be very interesting. The rules says to pick one of the two randomly drawn (and there is a variant to pick from 5 randomly selected before game), but still this is the least favorite aspect of the game for me - for strange reason I found them not fitting enough to the game. Also the goals are quite unbalanced, some much powerful or easier to complete than others.
- The game has a serious AP (analysis-paralysis) potential. Especially for new players it could be overwhelming what to do.

Very nice game. All our games so far have come really close, winning or losing within a few points. It feels that if you make a single mistake in optimal movements it could cost you the game, which makes it a very tense game.

It would've been even better if it could've been playable with 3 players... but it is a solid 2 players game.

However, it's not a game i see myself playing over and over all the time. This is a "once in a while" type of game.

A tile laying, pick up and deliver game

This game can be very "puzzly" and some people struggle in their first playthrough just simply trying to orient their maps correctly. Once you "get it" the game is actually quite elegant.

Really solid tile laying 1v1 game.  Deep enough to make you think out your next move but sometimes can be a little confusing to look at.  Once you get the idea of the game though, it will not disappoint.  Very clean and polished.  Definitely some luck involved in this one but also provides more than enough strategy to feel rewarding.  A good buy for sure.

Based on one play: Really liked that the deepest decision (tile placement) is made during the other player's turn. This keeps the game moving and avoids AP (which is a big problem for my gf). Really nice sense of accomplishment and engaging decisions, but still with enough luck-sauce to keep you from taking it too deadly seriously. This may soon reign with Aton atop the couples-gaming heap!

RATING: 8
Akrotiri is a clever gem of a game with a nice pace and climax. It's a blend of tile-laying, pick-up and deliver, and market. The spatial aspect makes this a brain burner, but I've found that once my brain gets wired to interpreting the map cards, it flows nicely. 

I really like the game play, but there are some annoyances that could be improved upon. 

First, the cubes are not uniformly sized, and about half of mine to not nicely fit in my boats.

Second, the island of Thera is one "island", but is drawn on the starting tile as three islands, two with a port. This has been a minor hurdle in explaining the rules: "the three can be consider 'Thera' ".

Last, I'm adverse to hidden goals in games, especially when little can be done by the opponent to counter-act them. The Map cards are fine, but I'm concerned about the Goal cards. Minimally, play with the Strategist Variant in the rules. I think a better option would be for each player to select one at the beginning of the game (for a total of two goals), and both players can compete for those goals (much like the Longest Route or Most Ticket goals in Ticket to Ride). There's enough going on in the game, really. 

The Goal cards could have been given some theme to fit with the game, too. For example, the blue temple card could have been "The Favor of Poseidon" card.

Still, a very good game worth exploring out!

RATING: 6
A very interesting tile placement where 2 players face off trying to construct the Greek islands in a way that matches secret treasure maps. When the maps are ready, players sail to the islands to construct temples, which can be scored for additional points if the player's secret objectives line up. Very interesting but difficult to wrap your head around during gameplay, ultimately it isn't quite as interactive as I'd like.

30-45m, 2 players. 5+ plays.

RATING: 6
Akrotiri is a thoughtful game of action points, tile-laying, and pick-up and delivery. It has a similar Carcassonne aspect where you play the single tile in your hand. Thankfully, the designers had the sense of allowing you to draw at the end of your turn instead of the beginning to allow one to make plans during others turns. When you place tiles orthogonally adjacent to another tile, all sides work. One would think this makes things easier than other tile-laying games, but the tile placement and connecting routes is trickier than one would think. The overall game is more thoughtful than I would have expected.

There is a market of goods which has the standard 'less goods in the market, will provide more money' and the action point system is also pretty normal. What makes the game unique is the map cards. These cards show you the location of a temple to excavate on an island, based on relative landmarks. Since players make up the world with tile-laying, you are trying to strategically make the world based on these map cards. The hidden end game bonuses are usually based on the temples you excavate, so that adds another layer to the tile-laying.

Overall, I enjoyed the game but it seems like the highest VP map cards won't be selected very often due to players trying to rush temples for goals, bonus actions, and ending the game while it's in their favour. If both players follow this strategy, it feels like randomness would affect the game more than I would like. I'd like to test this theory more, but I have a number of 2-player games that I prefer... including tile-laying games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The map-building aspect of Akrotiri is both beautiful and fulfilling. The tiles look great as they slowly encompass the table, and the temples and boats are nice additions. Managing to satisfy your temple cards, while also ensuring an accessible route to it is neither complex or simple, but remains satisfying. Correctly choosing to pursue medium or hard temple cards is critical to controlling the pace of play, but the goal cards can be leveraged to unsuspectingly snatch victory from your opponent. The goal-drafting variant is a necessity to reduce what can otherwise be an unwarranted swing of luck near the end game. Akrotiri is easy on the eyes and the mind, making it a great cool down game.

[b]Rating based on - 2 plays, 2 player[/b]
A 2 player only tile placement pickup and deliver game  with an action point allowance system and a market manipulation mechanism that leads to the fulfillment of secret objectives. 

All of those types of things appeal to me in games so I was excited to get this one to the table. However, it wasn't a great success for many reasons:
- Tile Placement, Map Cards, Secret End Game Objective Cards - From the way the map develops you can be screwed with the cards you get if that layout is not conducive to the maps you have in hand. We've found that even buying more maps at Thera did not seem to help. Also, much like Takenoko, it is possible for the other person to unknowingly complete the exact layout you need to fulfill your objectives. In our first game, despite not drawing tiles at random and using the oracle to carefully select a tile on every one of my turns, it was exactly what my opponent needed to complete his goal cards. His comment was, "Well, this is rather boring. I feel like I am playing by myself!"
- Action Point Allowance System - Whenever you excavate a temple to the blueprint specifications on your Map Cards, you unlock an extra action or benefit. This leads to the person being ahead to remain ahead and we've found that often the other person has to start all over because the person in the lead has now built a temple on the island they've been eyeing and there is a restriction of one temple per island. Very frustrating!
- Pickup and Deliver and Market Manipulation - The PU&D was kind of repetitive and the market manipulation did not end up being that exciting as we mostly concentrated on the goods that we'd been driving up the price of ourselves. We were rarely interested in or able to capitalise on the other goods as neither of us left any pickings!

Overall, I was disappointed in how the game ultimately played out. I still think it has potential, and maybe we just needed to play it a bit more, but there are lots of games we'd rather play and my gaming partner has stated flatly that he is not interested in this title.

If you had told me about a "tile-laying, route building, recipe fulfillment, resource management" game for 2p only in 30-45 minutes, I would have said "hard pass".  In its description, it just seems like it's too mechanical, too procedural, too clunky.  Well, it isn't.  It's so unexpectedly intuitive, so energy can be given to pushing through the opacity of optimum scoring (at least it seems opaque to me, which may be because I'm just terrible at the game).

Manual mejorable. En definitiva, otro juego sobrevalorado, como tantos en los últimos tiempos.

The gameplay in this game is very intriguing. You have to find the optimal routes for picking up and delivering your goods, just like Venus of Merchants. But it didn't feel like I had to play optimally to win as once a few tiles have been explored it gets too easy to place the temples. I would have liked for the game to be tighter. 

We might have played an important rule wrong in our first game, We will have to try it again soon and make sure we play everything correct!

RATING: 8
This is a pretty cool 2-player pick-up-and-deliver tile lying game.  The rules are not overly complex, but it is not a light 2-player game either.  As you lay a tile down at the beginning of each turn, there are a lot of factors to consider that will affect your placement decision (which is really neat): how it may open up shipping lanes to far off islands, where goods will be placed for pick-up, where icons are located on the board so that monuments can be built, and where the tile is in relation to the 2 players' boats.  There's enough to think about that I would steer clear of this with AP-prone players.  The luck is mitigated in that players can use their actions to collect lots of monuments cards, and have the option of picking from several end-game goal cards.  It's pretty well-balanced.  My first game was closer to 75 minutes than the 45 minutes written on the box, but it was time well spent, and I look forward to bringing this to the table again soon!

Akrotiri left me a bit underwhelmed.  Perhaps I set my expectations too high but I was hoping something about it would feel unique in the realm of Tile Placement or Pick-up and Deliver games.  Akrotiri is pleasant enough but I felt that its mechanics were not implemented in any differentiated way from other games of this type and also the actions are limited to a point where I never felt like I was free to pursue different routes to victory.  I think the mechanics jived well with the theme, moving your boat around to collect resources and excavate temples on the islands.  It feels like it is in the lighter camp of games but I felt at times that it tried to be more than what it is.  I just didn't feel the "brain burn" that some others report.  Tile placement felt elementary when considering map cards; resource collection for money felt dull after awhile; the excavation objectives felt too easy by the end game (even the 7VP cards were not too difficult to fulfill by the final rounds); and most frustrating was that the bonus VP cards felt half-baked and a couple I discarded because they were a little too wordy and screwy to concern myself with.  And the bonus VP cards were a little luck-driven by the end as you may have already achieved those objectives or not before even drawing the card.  Overall, it's an okay game and probably a good one for those who really like lighter "pick up and deliver" games, but with a heavy heart I say that I think it's somewhat forgettable.

This is definitely heavier than it looks.  At first glance, it's a simple tile-laying game, but this turned out to be a bit of a brain-burner.  I can also imagine every game being very different, depending on the paths made between islands.  This has the potential for a ton of replayability.

My rating is based on a 3 player play.

It feels very lucky. What tile the other player(s) place, it may help you or not. And I won, and I don't know why, it felt like I'm going to end last. And for me that's not a good sign, to random.

And at the beginning you are overwhelmed where you can place a temple. And at the end it almost doesn't matter because you can fulfill everything everywhere.

It takes a little while to get your head around the rules of this one, and some of the goal cards are not at all obvious to start with (there is an appendix explaining them all).

An awesome tile placement game for 2 players. In this game you explore and discover new lands by placing tiles, you also are trying to find and build temples with the cards in hand. 
This game is prone to have AP, especially when placing tiles (which is the first action of any turn), but that's not a big deal for a two player game, besides that can be mitigated by thinking ahead while the other player is making his actions.
A great strategy game with a lot going on, replay value is huge and the options are immense.

After one play I rate this as a 6 but I need more time with the game to give it a solid rating. It is obviously a very tightly designed game and the components are of good quality. I liked how the resource market worked and think that may be one of the games strong suits. I had difficulty discerning routes and where the resource images were in relation to my cards. Between the shipping routes and islands the tableaux  seem very visually busy once you are a few turns in. After the first play I can see that it is possible to have a runaway leader situation in this game.

Rahdo's video helped me make the decision for whether to buy the game or not.

[b]Reasons I own it:[/b]

- The exploration theme with the gameplay
- Even don't theme isn't my first priority, this one has a strong theme in my opinion and that makes it easy to teach
- Non-conflicting 
- 2 player only (I LOVE 2 player games)

[b]Components and presentation[/b]

Zman's Akrotiri has really good components, the tiles are big and chunky, there is something about the temple, it feels like wood but the weighs like a metal. It feels good to hold. The only minor complaint I have is the resource management board - it's just a thin sheet and if you aren't careful and bump your play area, there are chances that you might shift things a bit on it. The boat/ship piece is really nice too. I would have like the wooden bits to be a bit more bigger but I see the reason it's a small size, to accommodate the pieces on the boat's loading cavity.

[b]Reasons I like playing it:[/b]

- The sense of exploration in the game is really great, it's not so much about exploring the unknown, but more like you chart a course to a known location to try and find/establish a temple
- Even though you can just pick up the cubes, whenever we play we make sure we load it into the boat and sail our way back to Tera.
- Akrotiri starts faced paced and becomes slow towards mid-game (after about 8 tiles have come on the play area), it starts to get deep and thinky
- Even though there is no take-that element, there is still a tension on the aspect about opponent building a temple before your turn on an island, which blocks you from building on it
- The cards that tell us where the temple is located is brilliant
- The objective cards gives you a purpose and direction for placing the temple rather than randomly placing in it any free island
- I love the AP I go through in this game

[b]Favourite gameplay mechanisms[/b]

- I love the no-hassle pick-up & delivery this game has and how the economy is build, you can just randomly delivery cubes of any colour, but that's not a smart way to do it as it can really limit how much you earn.
- Oh those awesome awesome map cards with varying difficulty - love them
- The objective cards make the way you play really unique and not just hurrying up to find a temple
- I love the Oracle option, once per turn to find your tile that you need
- The action tokens are nice way to keep track of the actions we have
- The rewarding aspect of the game, the game always has something for you when you build one of your 6 temple
- The way the orientation of icons are used for finding the temples is splendid, so you can sit anywhere you like on a play area and it doesn't matter

[b]Things I am not very fond of in the game[/b]

- The point I mentioned in the components carries over to here, I wish there was some kind of indentation on the board to keep the tokens/pieces. Now I understand from a production stand point that would have been expensive.
- Few objective cards are difficult to score, but this can be easily remedied by visiting the forums on BGG
- The cubes are really tiny and it can be easily lost, a minor complaint


Akrotiri is one of my favourite 2 player game in my current collection. We just love playing this game. Renu and I love heavy euro games that makes our brain do some gymnastics but we don't get to play it every time we want to, Akrotiri is one among few that really scratches that itch for us. Its simple with minimum setup time and we are off. The exploration of a temple is really amazing and the discovery one is just so satisfying. . This game deserves more love than it gets.

The game is going to be our companion for a while, for sure. I hope designers or the publisher release an expansion with more objectives or release a second edition with new rules but keeping the soul element of the game intact.

Rahdo's video helped me make the decision for whether to buy the game or not.

[b]Reasons I own it:[/b]

- The exploration theme with the gameplay
- Even don't theme isn't my first priority, this one has a strong theme in my opinion and that makes it easy to teach
- Non-conflicting 
- 2 player only (I LOVE 2 player games)

[b]Components and presentation[/b]

Zman's Akrotiri has really good components, the tiles are big and chunky, there is something about the temple, it feels like wood but the weighs like a metal. It feels good to hold. The only minor complaint I have is the resource management board - it's just a thin sheet and if you aren't careful and bump your play area, there are chances that you might shift things a bit on it. The boat/ship piece is really nice too. I would have like the wooden bits to be a bit more bigger but I see the reason it's a small size, to accommodate the pieces on the boat's loading cavity.

Unexpectedly came across this being demoed at Terminal City Tabletop Con today (I have wanted to try this for some time now). Loved it! 

It has a great blend of mechanics that keep the game running through progressively more strategic game play, and we realized about halfway through our game that we had managed to make the game harder for ourselves (really pay attention to that one temple per island rule) (I'm not kidding) (seriously). 

I'm normally a pretty sore loser but I was so jazzed about this game in spite of the loss that we bought a copy not five minutes after our game concluded and had Jay sign it.

I'm not going to rate it yet, but in our game, the turns got longer and longer as the game went along and the map grew.  At the same time, there was not that much planning that you could do when it is not your turn due to game state changes created by the other player.

Update - Clean design, but if you have AP, beware, as the turns can take longer and longer if you try to optimize.

I playtested this as a prototype when it still played up to 4 players. It's definitely better as a 2 player as there is less downtime. It's a fun reverse-deduction kind of game, with similarities to Tobago, where you try to make the board fit with what are on your map cards in order to locate the temples.

RATING: 5
Akrotiri is a pleasant combination of tile-laying, route-building, pick-up and delivery, hidden end-game objectives, and "mission"-based scoring. As you build the archipelago up, you take your ship around picking up goods as you go (with a market you can game), sell them while keeping on the lookout for locations to meet the conditions build your temples (as per your "mission" cards). The game itself is gorgeous, and packs quite a punch for its incredibly small shelf-space size. However, the game feels most like a race to achieve one's goals first -- interaction is primarily through the market (which means the opponent will get a slight bit less income) and getting to the goods first. However, a pleasant game I would play again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Ok game. The game has some interesting mechanics ("building" the board in a way that matches both your objectives and economy), but lacks player interaction.
Since objective cards are hidden, most player interaction is coincidental (eg. building a temple on an island where your opponent was going to build one), but that little interaction can still screw over the other player, which leaves a bad taste...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.1
One of the few abstract games which I really dig!
I like the "we're going to discover treasures" aspect, the need to optimize your actions, the attempt at controlling the randomness of which tile you get to lay where and how on Earth we ever will get to these resources with the crazy routes we've created.
A very strategic small game.
I really wish it came with stuff for 4 players in the box from the start. Need to get the new edition for that (even if it'll double the game's box size...)

MSRP:
2nd edition (blue/grey): 33€ English.
1st edition: 24€.
Target: 15€? (just repaint the pieces for 4colors to make it a 4-player game!)

Received as Christmas gift but never got to the table. Played once and did enjoy it, but not enough that it would likely become a regular. Can only introduce so many new games to my partner, and there are several others I'd rather take a chance at before this one as I don't think she would enjoy the spatial deduction aspect of this game. Also, in effort to downsize the collection, prefer to keep games with more versatility in player count.

This game will always be special to me because I learned it with my brother. We knew from the first time we set the game up we would like it...but we are both dads and it took three times setting it up and taking it down before we got through the game.....And it was well worth it. The game was easy enough to learn as we struggled through that early learning curve.  Perhaps because we got through that curve on our first two failed starts we went into our first full game with a clear strategy from the start.  Bragging rights where high and banter a plenty. 
The game unfolded smoothly as we built out temples among the many islands. We love how heavy the temples are and the quality of all the components of this game. They even gave us little markers to help keep track of how many of our movements we have used (as it increases throughout the game). We turned our noises up at them at first but appreciated them later in the game. We also loved getting more 'end of game' victory point cards, choosing two and keeping one. In the end the final scoring was like a little cameo similar to Concordia. ... we both leap frogged  each other with big points until at last my brother ended a single point ahead of me... well done bro. 
A hint... instead of pen and paper to add up the final scoring, we used the in game money...one for one... we called the turn markers 10 and we found that worked really well.

Akrotiri has two main things going on. The first is a simple pick-up-and-deliver game where you send your boat to islands to grab goods and sell them back to the main island. This gives you the money to buy map cards and excavate temples on the islands that meet your map cards' requirements. Money isn't worth a lot at the end, but you need it to perform the point-generating actions. The second thing going on is a strategic tile-laying game to set up the patterns that match the map cards which enable you to excavate temples. When one player excavates all 6 of their temples, the game is over. There are also secret goal cards that you can collect that give you bonuses for building on certain islands in certain conditions.

This is for players who like logistics games and the puzzles they present. If you are not one of those players, there won't be much here for you to like. A good two-player logistics game is not all that common. There are a number of considerations and levers to pull in this one - frequency of selling, increasing options with more map cards, pushing the pace on your opponent by dropping lots of easy temples, manipulating goods prices with select cube placement and timing. The goal cards give you additional considerations without the hidden points getting out of hand (and if you have them out as an open draft, then you have an idea what patterns your opponent is attempting to create). Solid logistics title for two. Enjoyed this a lot.

first play through was fun, but not super exciting.  It's got a good system though, and once we play again using all the correct rules, I think it will improve and move somewhat faster.   

Still, i like the concept so far, and I love the box size.

1 more play before rating.

UPDATE:

2nd play was as good as the first, no worse, no better.  This is a great, strategic 2 player game that doesn't over complicate things, but offers enough to be interesting and variable each time you play.  This is a sold effort, overall, and one that will stay around due to the smaller footprint and large amount of depth for a 2 player only game.  Good stuff, just not "great."  Theme is sparse.

I really like this little gem, because of how original the whole spatial recognition thing works. It's mainly cool because of how different it plays. I also like the fact that players control the resources that are available for shipping, which eventually adds a lot of denial possibilities to the game. I've only played this game a handful of time, and do wonder if the whole spatial thing will get old, but right now, this is one I like a bunch.

Sadly for it though, the realm of excellent 30-mins games for two is quite saturated, which limits its table time.

Easily one of the most thinky and engaging small box two player games available.  Steer your ship, uncover temples, it's very interesting.  It can also play quickly.  It takes some time to get used to the spatial reasoning of temple placement, but once you have it, it clicks and the whole thing makes sense.  Grab this one if you like two player games with low/zero interaction that require brain power.

The 2-players game Carcassone should have been.  This is a tile placement game with pickup-and-delivery & hidden objectives.  I generally don't like PUnD games but this is really good.  The various aspects are well entangled which create meaningful choices and lots of player agency while remaining manageable (although it's certainly heavier than Carcassonne).  It's a real 2-player gamer's game, that plays reasonably fast (~1h) given the large scope.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Temple placement rules are a bit odd and can be a bit confusing. However, there is a bit of an interesting puzzle game going on here although there is also some luck of the draw when it comes to map and goal cards.

Akrotiri is an interesting game. When I saw it, I wasn't sure how I'd like it, as on the surface it looks like the sort of Euro thing I'm a bit weary of. And honestly, if it were a four-player game, that may have been where it stood. But for some reason, it being only a two-player game really helped sell it to me, and I can't explain why that is. It's an attractive game, where you build a little map as you go along, which I always like. The "maps" for placing temples is a neat idea, and there's some nice tension in it. Its puzzly nature is such that, on my opponent's final turn, I kind of wanted to help him find a place for his 7 point temple, just because doing so was fun. It's a nice 2p package.

It was quite different from most other two-player games I've played: You're actually creating the map to fit your needs, to be able to make money and dig up temples. The more temples you dig, the more actions or other bonuses you get. First player to build all temples wins.

This is a great 2p game. You place tiles that form sea routes similar to the lines in Tsuro and islands, similar to that of Carcassone. The tiles are beautiful and VERY cleverly designed. Each game creates a believable archipelago of islands, docks and routes with some large islands and some smaller ones. Just that alone makes it a winner.

But that's not all! There are resources to collect and a demand-based market that has an elegant simplicity - goods are cubes that cover up progressively increasing prices on the board. When you place a new good out on the board, it uncovers a higher price, so the price goes up (more demand). During your turn, you take actions to sail to the islands to pick up cargo, then bring them back to sell at the central island. When you sell them, the price starts dropping again (less demand). You have to use the Tsuro-style sea routes, which create extremely fun pathways that don't all connect in the way you'd like them to.

And what do you do with that sweet cash? You spend it building temples, which get points to win the game. This is where things get cool. Each tile has one of four symbols printed on it. You have to find a suitable place for the temple, sail there, and spend money. Each temple can only be built using a card from the temple deck. That card shows you how many of what symbols have to be in which directions from your proposed island location. It is difficult to place them at first but it becomes easier to accomplish as the game progresses and more tiles come out with symbols on them.

Too fun. There are tons of mechanisms that all come together elegantly to make this a wonderful game!

RATING: 7
Brilliant two player game where you are attempting to place tiles in a way that satisfies map requirements.  You move your boat to an island and can either pick up goods and return them for money or find a temple which allows you to score points and get money.  

Very fun game with a pick up and deliver element and spatial element with the map and tiles.  I really like this game.  Heavier than most simple two player games but if you like Targi this is a good step up.

Quite a lot of depth for such a small box. All you're doing is placing tiles while picking up and delivering resources, but the arrangement of the tiles determines what kinds of map cards you can score, while also affecting the value of your endgame bonus cards. Placing tiles also affects the value and accessibility of resources, both for you and your opponent.

The 2 players explore a beautiful Archipelago connected by shipping routes by placing one tile each round. Tiles come with resources, one determined by a symbol on the tile, the other chosen by the placing player. Players have a number of actions, like moving their ship, loading goods, or excavating temples. Temples are the puzzly aspect of this game, as you have to find an island that satisfies the condition on the map card, e.g. right of two blue symbols, above one red symbol, and left of two grey symbols.

Tile laying, victory conditions based on spatial relativity (I think that describes it?), available action points which increase as those conditions get met... just a very unique, interesting game.  Enjoyed it much more than I expected.

I would have like to try this, but I don't think I would have been able to teach it well, and it looked too complicated for my main 2-player game partner. Tbh, I think I already knew this before I bought it, but I was seduced by the cute little boats that ferry the cubes around. In the end, looking back on it I'm pretty sure there would have been too little interaction for me.

I suppose this might be a seven, but I like it less than Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small which sort of fits into the same slot (20-40 minute 2 player game).

The game looks nice, plays nice, and it is decently hard to figure out so it's a challenge to figure out what to do. However, it is without any sort of interaction (defined as screwage) whatsoever. I can hear the protests already "But the market, and the double-action to move through a port your opponent is in, and you can place tiles to screw over your opponent's goal cards and stuff!" but it just isn't enough for me personally. You play your own game, the actions are too restricted and tight for you to put much effort into trying to screw with your opponent - you can't afford it, the cost easily outweighs the benefit in most cases, the only devastating play you can make is ruining their goal cards - but then you are guessing since these are hidden, and meh... Nope, not enough for me. Still, I like it, there is a tension - a race-like quality - to the game. Though in the end, I'm not sure I'd not rather just play Carcassonne if laying tiles is your primary motivation.

Another point I'm hesitant on is the nature of the goal cards - playing with draw two pick one still can end up with a massive imbalance such as with the "at least three elements" goal which scored 18 all of a sudden, and the largest island goal which always is a safe 8 or so. These perceived imbalances might go away on repeat play, or the proposed "expert" variant might be the way to go. I'll certainly play this more since our 2-player rotation isn't that large so everything gets a chance to shine - but currently I'm ranking them Patchwork > Agricola: ACBS > Akrotiri.

A good game, very puzzle-like and peaceful!

UPDATE: 7 with open goal cards (the proposed variant in the rules).

UPDATE: Back to 6, there isn't as much here as I initially thought, and I suspect that even with open goal cards they really aren't all that balanced. Fine, but compares unfavourably to my other 2p go-to games (Patchwork, Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small and Kingdom Builder)

Amazing. Elements of tile laying, worker placement and buying/selling that all work seamlessly and naturally together for a game like no other. My favorite concept is the idea that you're creating a self-fulfilling prophecy of creating a location that matches your map card so you can "discover" a ruin. Played this quite a few times today and wanted to just keep on playing it. A medium-weight game - but a good 40 minute length. Also the production values are fantastic. The heavy material that the ruins are made out of feels great, the boats hold the small wooden cubes and the art on the front and backs of the tiles is gorgeous.

A solid two player abstract. For us at the beginning it was kinda hard to see the patterns and it takes quite a lot of tablespace for a two-player game, but it's very well thought and innovative.
The execution is very well done, nice illustration and sturdy components, especially the cute ship that can actually take up to 3 cubes (so a rule easily remembered).

Some goal cards might need recalibration, but that is easily done by a CD-marker (and you might arrive to a complete other conclusion, when it comes to goal difficulties) but the sheer amount of brain burning is admirable for such a simple and short game.

Pleasant game, with a pick up and deliver mechanism but it also mixes in Tsuro, Tobago, and Carcassonne. Major AP issues for such a middleweight game, and the tangle of white lines, islands and docks can be hard to read. The major issue is lack of direct interaction. It is easily possible to either ruin or assist an opponent's plans entirely by accident (with a placement of a tile or a temple); but there is no way of actually determining your opponent's plans, so there's no meaningful interaction. Money is initially tight but through double placements of cubes you can rapidly inflate prices and money thereafter really isn't a problem. The boats and temples are cute and the tiles are pretty--so I don't mind the occasional game. (Though it is possible to expand it from 2 to 4 players by adding an extra copy, that would be a mistake--the game would go on way too long, and probably overrun your available table space.)

The tile placment had me thinking a little but became the same over and over again, and became boring..
The end scoring card seem wonkey..

There's a heavy spatial component to the game, and while my wife is a wizard at spatial games, I'm typically awful, so (not surprisingly) she won.

At first glance, this game looks pretty minimalist. A few cards, some tiles and colored cubes, and a boat. But as you play though, the tiles become an expansive map with that can either take you across the ocean or loop back to where you came from. There are elusive islands that you KNOW have a temple waiting to be excavated that you just can't get to with the current shipping routes, so you pray to the oracle for some help... The colored cubes become precious and rare materials that are high in demand and will give you the funds you need to buy the ancient maps that will lead you to hidden ruins. 

I absolutely love this game. The theme is fun, the game play is easy to learn but the strategy is difficult to master. The end game is always a surprise due to achievement points that are only known to the player trying to achieve them, and there isn't really anything you can do about it as an opponent. It feels so good to count your points up at the end of the game, and see them skyrocket as you count up your achievement points, all the while watching your opponents smug face contort into a rage.

This game is just fun. Plain and simple. There has only been once or twice where I was a little irritated by the game, but even then I still had fun trying to figure out a way to work around the unfortunate luck I was having. I highly recommend this game to anyone willing to give 2 player games a shot. This one is never leaving my collection.

This game didn't really click for me, and I think I know why: The pickup-and-deliver mechanism, which is pretty central to the design, is really almost an afterthought compared to the temples. I do think it's cool how you have to plan for where your temples will be placed, even if it isn't the easiest thing to teach to new people. The pickup-and-delivery just feels completely pasted on though.

This game gave me a very similar feel to the old Kosmos game, Hellas, but I would much rather play Hellas if given the choice.

Of the two-player games we've played, it's the most thinky one we've gotten to the table. Our first few turns, we were just placing tiles, not really thinking about how that piece mattered in the scheme of the game. We traveled to the island, picked up the good that we placed and sold it.

But then we saw how placing meant building our map. Each tile was a place that we could travel to for cubes, a potential digging ground for temples, a symbol that manipulates the possible successful maps, and isles that make for just portage jumps to work on harder goal cards. The depth is there for sure.

When I first got the game, I almost assumed that the pick-up-and-deliver mechanic was the game. It's not. It's the combination of all the mechanics, from the pick-up-and-deliver economy, the tile placement and the mental puzzle of seeing if a map is successful. Really can't wait to hit the table again.

Really great 2-player game. The graphic design is wonderful. As the map tiles are played over the course of the game, it definitely evokes the feeling of exploration and discovery. But the core mechanic for excavating temples is what sets the game apart. It handles deduction in a manner similar to [gameid=42215]. Super cool. Really glad I picked this one up. Great game to play with my wife.

[i]Boy was I wrong about this one, after playing 3 times I still never felt like I had a good grasp of the rules ([i] way to many ambiguities, especially with the scoring cards)[/i] and it just ended up sitting on the shelf until I traded it.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- Beautiful components [i](the temples look great on the board)[/i], love the art style and the art really pops off the glossy tiles.
- Excellent combination of tile laying, route building and pick up and deliver.
- Really interesting use of the spacial elements of the board by having to build temples on a specific island that meets all of the temple placement rules of a card.
- Tough choices to make since you are concerned with not only the route you are building, but also the placement of the symbol on the board.
- Race element; at a certain point in the game you really start to feel pressure to stockpile money and build temples as the islands without temples built become scarce.[/i]

My favorite two-player-only game!  Always a sucker for games with tiles and boats.  I love how you cleverly have to choose how to place your tile each round, deciding if you place it to account for the location of the icons (aka, building temples), or to place it help gain you more money (aka, placing resources), or to place it in order to gain trade route access to more islands.  And after that, you still have all of your actions that must choose each turn (you start with 3 and can end up with 6 by the end; I love that!).  And you must pick your actions so that you remain more efficient than your opponent.  You win by being the most efficient AND by having the most points (goal cards are important here!!).  Great combo of mechanics, great theme, great choices.  Love it!

Quite meaty for a 2-player game, and although pick-up-and-deliver is by no means my favourite mechanic it works fairly well. Trying to work out which of your contracts (sorry: maps) you can fill is a bit annoying, though, as you keep holding up cards against the board each turn. It adds a bit of unnecessary downtime.

Still, there's a good mixture of luck and planning and there's something about the shared gallows humour of never drawing the right tile symbol, or paying to draw the one you want and getting it on the first draw, that adds a bit of fun into the thinkiness.

I really want to like this game, but pickup and deliver and race games simply do not float my trireme.

Great little game. I wish it came with card holders (AKA, like scrabble-tile holders) because it's much more fun when you're not trying to juggle all the goal cards and map cards and such. It's necessary to see everything you have at your disposal to plan your explorations - otherwise you spend a lot of time fiddling with your cards, so we usually play on opposite sides of the kitchen table where we can each set our goal cards on a chair beside us and see them without revealing our goals to our competitors.

But that's a minor thing. 

The game is a near perfect mid-weigt 2p. 

Push your luck is a neat feature. The sooner you go for the big goals, the better off you are, but if your opponent completes a bunch of small goals while you're working toward your big goal cards, you'll lose. You have to ride the edge and not "miss the shift" Sometimes you have to be brutal and sacrifice a turn simply to buy new goals if your competitor beats you to an area, so flexibility is important too. Push your luck but stay flexible. What a cool game - very under-rated and quick if you don't have AP. Good midweight game that doesn't overstay its welcome and leaves you feeling that you've had a substantial gaming experience in a short period of time.

*Update
I made some card holders - about 18" long each - 1" square stick with a 1/4" wide slot 3/4" deep running down the center - rounded the edges and lacquered them. It transorms game-play. Having all your options and bonus goal cards clearly visible at all times is fantastic. It makes the game quicker, deeper and more fun. I don't think I'd play this game without card holders anymore. The difference is that significant.

Not a bad game but not a great one either. Depends on what one likes, I suppose.

The game is simple, fairly swift, and elegant. The theme isn't quite perfectly in sync with the game, but it's the sort of game where that's not really an issue (nor do I think something you could really improve considering how wonderfully simple the game is).

I think that two player games really are wonderful things. They're built as a concise experience, where two people get to interact, both playing the game, and ideally chitchatting a bit as you go. They tend to be games where you point out tactics to the other player as you go, and really create a wonderful bonding experience.

Akrotiri is really well put together, and Is just a lovely little thing.

Super solid 2-player game with lots of tough choices that are enhanced by the race to get things done first or build somewhere first. You also need to have the money available to do most of these actions so you have to use some of your time(actions) to earn money before you can accomplish your other time sensitive tasks. I love the tile laying with the intent to complete goals and the component quality is top notch(even the box, new edition).

Love playing this game. Although Govind has always won, this game is something I can play anytime. It is the tile placement that seals the deal for me. 

Reasons I love:
1)Simple tile laying but deep thinking involved. At the beginning of each turn, player has to lay down a tile. As the game progresses, this gets more complex due to temple cards. These temple cards are location cards for temples with specifications. A temple can not be excavated without meeting certain specifications. This is what makes it immensely interesting for me.
2) Objective cards that make it meaty. Although it is not compulsory to fulfill objectives, it sure makes end game scoring satisfying.
3) Design and tiles. Just love the quality of the components. The look of each tile and icons are very easy to understand.

Things that I don't like:
1) Objective cards. Although they are good for end game scoring, some of them are highly ambiguous and that makes it extremely difficult while scoring.
2) layout of the map. I wish the grid system was little better and clearly specified on the map. It gets confusing while excavating a temple.
3) Certain questions of objective cards are not answered in rulebook. It would have been helpful if examples were provided. 

Apart from these,there are no negatives that I can find in this gameplay itself. This is one of my absolute favourite game and it will remain so for a long while. The sense of building and expanding is truly satisfying.

Very good 2-player tile laying game.  Totally fires Carcassonne for me.  Nice engine building with getting easy temples down fast to increase your actions, and then timing when to push for the higher point cards when the board is more fleshed out. And nice rhythm with spending money, picking up cubes, heading back home to sell.  The goal cards really drive your strategy too.  My only complaint is the final turns can be pretty luck-driven if you draw big temple cards that can or can't be completed. I have the same issue with Takenoko. But it's light enough, that it doesn't matter.

So many premium components in such a tiny box. And the gameplay is pretty deep and satisfying as well. Love that there's tile laying for both creating the situations for the map cards you want to place as well as providing new trade route paths for the ships to traverse on.

There's a bit of a rich get richer mechanic where players more successful placing temples will get more actions than their opponent and be able to do more than them, as well as blocking spaces that the opponent might have taken up with their temples, making their ability to catch up more difficult, but while that might bug me in other games, it actually doesn't bother me at all in this one. Great game.

Played Aktrotiri for the first time recently. It's a really nice 2P tile laying resource collection game where you try to complete map cards by excavating lost temples on the Greek isles to acquire variable victory points. Took a bit to get the hang of it, but we really enjoyed attempting to meet the unique mapping criteria and bonuses for our temple locations. We grappled with the temple seeking feature at first, but I kinda dig that mechanic now. I bought these Ancient Greek coins last year from Artana (leftover from their Best Damn Gaming Coins KS) with the intent of adding to my copy of Akrotiri whenever I got around to playing. They worked out great. You can now order them from Broken Token if you'd like some for your copy:

http://www.thebrokentoken.com/ancient-greek-theme-set/

They also sell just the dolphin and fly coins separately for $5.99 for 12 and 15 coins respectively if you don't have use for the other coins in the set.

Ultimately Melissa won 39 to 26. I'm sure we can improve now that we've played through once. Looking forward to another game soon. Though I've just played Akrotiri as 2P, I wonder how it would be with two copies as a 4P pick up and delivery? Let me know how it is if youve tried this.

This is a 2-player only pick up and deliver tile placement game. I enjoy it quite a bit. There are ways to score points during the game by building temples (you also unlock additional actions on your turn when you build temples) and there are cards with end-game bonuses on them, which you keep secret, that help direct your strategy. Neat and fairly quick.

RATING: 8.5
My first impression after one play: I love this game!!  There are some really neat things going on under the hood: a Tobago-style "treasure" (temple) hunt fueled by a pick-up-and-deliver economic system and based around the type of tile laying/exploration that seems to appeal to most of us gamer folk.  The physical production is great (though the pleasingly hefty weight of the temples lead to some minor damage of the game's cardboard components before I even purchased it, due to the way in which it was packed) and I love that the boats actually carry the resource cubes.  People who should avoid this one are those who are prone to analysis paralysis, and people who have a particularly hard time with spacial visualization.  One final note to publishers: if you want people to spread positive word of mouth about your games, don't give them weird names that are hard to remember/spell!!  Game design: 4.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 4/5  Total: 8.5/10

Really tactical pick up and deliver style game.  Get's a little thinky towards the end.  Very enjoyable.  I recommend starting with the strategist variant with the revealed goals otherwise the scoring can be pretty surprising with the hidden goals at the end.  

Includes second copy to be able to play 3 or 4 player games.  I play 8 tiles per player (1 start + 7) in a 4 player game which is enough tiles for a good game. I also change the number of temples needed to end the game to 5 instead of 6 so there are two viable ways that the game can end.

After one play, I'm really enjoying Akrotiri. There are many decisions to be had, but the game opens up organically as the board expands. I hope that with experience, the speed and tightness that I saw hints of will reveal themselves as rich and rewarding.

Need to get more plays, but this seems like a really fantastic two player game. It has a lot going for it: the exploration is really well-done, the hidden goals are fun, the pick up and deliver is some of the best I've played, and the game has a nice escalation to it.

About the pick up and deliver, it's really easy. This is in contrast to a lot of other PUaD games I've played where it takes several turns to just slowly move across the board, pick up one item, then slowly move somewhere else. In Akrotiti you're mainly making decisions about what to pick up and where. Actually picking up the items usually only takes an action or two.

The escalation of the game is really satisfying. On every turn two cubes are added to the board but they come out faster than they can be consumed. So early on you don't have a ton of cubes to pick up, but by the later part of the game there are cubes everywhere and you're having to assess the best move from several good choices.

It's too early to tell, but I can see a couple of possible issues. One would be balance issues of some of the goals. There are at least one or two that seem to be much easier or harder to accomplish than others. There also could be potential for a runaway leader, because you get more actions as you do better at the game. I just need more plays to see if those issues hold up.

Still, the game seems very promising so far.

Update: Sold the game for a couple of reasons. Mainly, I don't play two player games much these days.

But also after a recent play it seems like there could be a possible runaway leader issue, largely due to luck. If you choose to place cubes that will make a single color more valuable, then you pick up those cubes on the same turn, you can get a good money lead if the other player isn't able to do the same thing. This can be exacerbated by one player getting more actions for placing temples earlier than the other player.

Despite the possible issues it's still a really fun game to play. For the rare times I play two-player games these days, I've just got lots of other options.

Sold.

Tobago + Tongiaki. Tobangiaki?

I like Tobago's unique "create the treasur map" mechanic and I normally like games that create their board as you go, but the combination in this one can bring out a lot of AP in the spatially challenged. Not a game flaw per se, however, one needs be more selective in their opponents with this title than with Tobago. Having two levels of spatial reasoning (even if one level is fairly basic) makes this an hour-and-a-half slog for some.

With a quicker opponent the games is quick and brain-burn-y on the order of Mykerinos.

It even throws in a simple stock market, so another plus for me.

I think there is room for this and Tobago if you like the chief mechanic of the two.



Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 3
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 3
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 1
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3


Overall - 3

Wow, there is quite a lot of game in this little box from Z-Man. It involves (pretty strategic) tile laying, hand management, logistics, action point allocation and even market management. There is luck involved in the form of card and tile drawing, but the game certainly feels more thinky than luck driven despite of this. I especially like the fact that you are really competing/racing for the central spots on the map, as each island only holds one temple. Really the only drawback that I can think of is the length of the game - our first game lasted a good while longer than the indicated 45 minutes, just outstaying its welcome. All in all, however, this is one of the best medium weight euro, pure 2 player games I have ever played. If I can bring the playing time down next time, I will rate it an 8. Too bad my girlfriend did not like it as much as I did (too much pattern recognition in the second half of the game). Looking forward to playing again.

Played at Cafe Mox and really enjoyed it! I credit this game with being one of my major gateway games. We played it on my birthday years ago and I was so surprised...I had never played a game like it and never knew games like that even existed. I wanted it ever since, but it went out of print before I could get a copy. Was thrilled to find it was reprinted in 2017 and snagged a copy the week it went on sale in the US!

2 player game. Quick to set up and learn the rules. However, on your first game, it takes awhile to wrap your head around what you need to do.  You have to figure out how to place your tiles so you can place your temples to match your map cards, but you also have to make sure you are also meeting the conditions of your End Game Goal Cards. It's a puzzle and I like that.

Akrotiri gave me much more to think about than I expected from the elevator pitch. I had a quick take of it being some kind of Tsuro/Tobago hybrid. I mean it sort of is, but those are both very light games, which doesn't apply to Akrotiri at all. Multiple times during my games, I'd have to stop and tear my hair out trying to figure out the most efficient way to use my allotted actions, to get where I needed to be. The end game scoring objectives are truly hard to pull off as well, meaning there were a whole lot of furrowed brows bouncing back and forth between my opponent and me.

While that complexity is there, I like that it is largely player controlled. It reminds me a little of Carcassonne in that aspect, as you can just play tactically and connect your dots, for a relaxing time with plenty of room for conversation. But if you and your opponent want to get deep, the game absolutely rewards blocking and hate drafting to sabotage treasure maps, as I learned when I played for the first time and my experienced opponent read me like a book, blocking me in every way imaginable.

I like that it has that flexibility, although I hesitate to call it a good gateway, because of those fairly complex end game goals. But if your partner can dip their toes into mid-weight Euros, they can certainly handle this one. 

Easily my favorite of the Bamboozle Brothers' games.

I'm completely enamored with Akrotiri. Not sure why: I expect it has to do with the light to medium mechanics and the laid-back gameplay. I have two copies of the game: one first edition and one second edition, which makes it possible to play with up to 4 players. Give this one a try: it's one of those hidden gems.

Two player action point race to discover lost temples in the Greek Islands. Island tiles are placed with distinct landmarks using reverse deduction to match map cards. To pay for these costly explorations and eventual excavations, pick up and deliver goods from the islands along defined ship routes to sell for market driven drakmas at the home island of Thera. Use the Oracle to make that the right island tile is drawn. Reminds me of Tobago meets Carcasonne. Engaging puzzle that escalates quickly as the explorers chart the surrounding islands. Orienting the map cards with the islands can be a bit frustrating for the directionally challanged.

Quick game that combines tile placement and a pick-up and deliver mechanic.  It slows down a little toward the end as you are trying to cycle through your maps to figure out what gets you the most points, but it still plays in about 45 minutes or so.  Decent option if you're looking for a 2p game!

There's some fun puzzles to solve here: first, placing tiles to build the ship routes and islands needed and second, figuring out where to excavate the temples. There's a tiny bit of economics with the resource board and picking up and delivering goods. All together it blends well to make one of the best 2-player games I own. 

Colorblind player complained a little about green and gray cubes; if somebody can see the colors, it's not an issue.

A clever and attractive (if a little hard to grasp) tile-laying game for two players only. I was impressed with how much is happening in the game and the amount of choices presented to the players.

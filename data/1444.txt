GBOH system. Good game but it gets frustrating having to figure out the differences for each game in the series. I wish they could get their act together and come up with a master rules set for the entire line.

Great counters make this a good looking game. You certainly get the feel of playing a 'Punic' war game especially with the line commands and Roman Manipular extension rules. However I find the combat procedure torturous  with reams of tables and tons of factors to take into account.

Playing this with SGBOH rules and finding a really good mix of playability with historical aspects, sort of a mix between C&C:A and GBOH(though much closer to the latter).

Good system for tactics and the feel of the power of "shock" when armies collide.  Best  used with the simple GBOH rules, otherwise it can be cumbersome.
Last battle fought: Beneventum 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Like so many of the GBOH titles (and Richard Berg games in general), there really are too many rules considering there are so few scenarios that are balanced and/or interesting. One of the better entries in the series, just due to the number of expansions and therefore the number of reasonable scenarios you can play with the same rules. I'm a Roman History nut, so I'd like to play this more often, but the complexity combined with the lack of replayability for most scenarios causes a lot of problems.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Best wargame simulating ancient warfare in the Punic Wars. A bit dice heavy and there are many exceptions to the rules, certainly not a game for beginners. There are other volumes in the Great Battles of History series and many other Modules using more or less the same game mechanics.

RATING: 9
(2007-10-31) I like the GBoH system because of its detailed treatment of how and why the armies of that period fought the way they did and won or lost.  It does this without being unmanageable, so that a typical battle can be resolved in one afternoon.

It has its issues, and one of my issue with the game is that a unit with an enemy unit in it's flank is pinned by the enemy unit's ZOC and can't even turn around to fight back, even if at a big disadvantage.

But otherwise it is a fine simulation and very competitive game wise.  Some have complained that the "series" of games in the GBoH family are not compatible, particularly in things like command control, but I think they miss the point since the core of these games is the command control system for the era of warfare being presented.  So, I expect that Deluxe Alexander will have different CC than The Civil Wars, and they would be less meaningful if such was not the case.

This is a game for more those wo wants to play out history than for those who wants a balanced game. This doesn't bother me as I think just trying to do better than historically is fun enough even if I know I'll lose.

I had the old version with all modules but sold them and bought the new updated version instead. The right thing to do?

RATING: 6
Probably the most interesting of the Great Battles of History series, as it sees a clash of two different styles of warfare: the Roman system vs the Greek/Macedonian phalanx.

RATING: 9
It includes 2 double sided hex maps, plenty of counters and markers; all of excellent quality. Also, you will find a rules booklet and a scenario one to play 5 scenarios. Plenty of dense data and historical background allow you to simulate in a accurate way the melee between Romans, Carthaginians, Macedonians and Pyrrhus's Greek mercenaries in central Italy. The final scenario (Beneventum 275 BC) portrays an assault on a roman fort containing 'scorpio' artillery pieces. The game mechanics are accurate and allow you to find out interesting fighting situations even in a solitaire mode. A must have in a wargame collection.

In my opinion the best of the GBoH series games.

RATING: 6
I wanted to like this game.  It was my first foray into ancient warfare.  After playing the game a few times, I believe I have a much better appreciatrion of the mechanics and tactics of ancient warfare.  There is much to commend to this game.  Unfortunately, the accounting portion of the game was much too cumbersome for me.  There are markers for the number of hits each unit has taken and when your troups have routed.  Removing one hit marker for another (my calvary now has three hits instead of two) removed much of the joy of the game for me.  With the hit markers on top of the units, you could not easily discern your units capabilities (movement, fire, ability to take hits).

In addition to the accounting aspects of the game, for a tactical war game, it seemed like the playing time was too long for my liking (this may be related to placing and removing hit markers).  The games take a while to set up and then at least three hours to play, assuming you are well versed in the rules.

I still want to like SPQR, but the game accounting, set up time, and playing time took away from my enjoyment.

Bought a ziplocked copy directly from GMT a couple of years back. Also got Phyrric Victory from them in a sale about a year later. Still later bought War Elephant (required by PV) from my FLGS, all the while without having ever played the game! Now I'm just going to get the counter sheet for PV from C3I #2 from GMT, and all will be well :)

UPDATE: Got the counter sheet, and bought the Deluxe ed. box to store it all -- this is really an ad hoc edition of SPQR :) Thinking of getting a hold of the Barbarian module next. Prefer to play w/Simple GBoH rules. Great game, fun and varied scenarios!

The game is great, the graphics are beautiful. It just goes on a bit long, with the rally results. We play without the rallying capability of re leaders and it plays much quicker, and I don't think that it detracts too much from e game. In fact, it makes you a little more careful with your troops.

A great combat system and good OOB research, but the command system (a combination of louder megaphones and timewarping for the good leaders) deny it any decent simulation value.  One of the most ahistoric renditions of Cannae that one can find in wargames (complete with a silly and ahistoric "layered" legion setup that artificially slows the Romans down).  You're very unlikely to see the frequent type of "backhand victory" (such as Cannae) in a system that artificially slows down action on most of the field to focus on the "flying columns" that leap across the field to bring the decision.

Someone should put Rob Markham's command system on this, until then Command & Conquer is just as good history for a fraction the effort.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
SPQR is simply the best game covering the ancient period, in this incarnation the middle and late republic, around. As much I like Lost Battles, the latter is just a pale filler compared to SPQR. The rules are not difficult, the game is quite intuitive, the depiction of the different combat systems is well done and sufficiently nuanced, and the narrative is here. I know people complain about game length and markers, but they are not as bad as the haters want us to believe. The counters' graphic is nice and evocative even if some icons are, in my opinion, a little wrong.

The only real drawback... having every expansion and the old 1st edition box the thing is cramped.

I really, really love SPQR.  It's one of those games I've played over and over for some 15 years now, and each time I learn something new.  Excellent physical components and incredible support from GMT in terms of modules and C3i articles and scenerios.  Rules are a little clunky (example: do we really need TWO charts to find out which column of the THIRD chart we roll on for combat?) and counter density can be a bit heavy at times, but this is quibbling.  Scenarios tend to be unbalanced, but then again, so was history, and things can be adjusted for those wishing a  more balanced game.  More complex than other GBoH games, but if you have any interest at all in ancient history this is a must have, expecially now that GMT is reprinting it.

Bought this decades ago - its the 1994 reprint with the 2nd edition rules. I'd only ever set set up, but never got around to playing, Bagradas. Finally got around to playing it today(12/06, 12th March 2016) - I think the system is good, but the rules are not very well organised (pretty good fun to read the notes though). I'm sure I made a load of mistakes, but the whole thing started to flow quite nicely. I liked it so much I've ordered a couple of the modules.
Edit - love this game more and more. Once past the initial barrier of understanding the rules (still have issues...), the game has a very satisfying flow and feel. I love it as a solo experience, and hope to find a real life opponent one day.
Edit - printed off the 3rd ed rules and have gone back to Bagradas to give the Romans another kicking ;). Its all beginning to come together now, and I like it so much I've ordered all the modules I can find!
Edit - pretty much done Bagradas to death in an attempt to learn the system. Bought all the modules I can find, and now wondering which battle to attempt next...maybe Trebbia, or something with Samnites. So much choice!

One of my favourite wargames.  SPQR has always been fun to play and really makes me feel that I am in command of a legion smiting the enemies of Rome.
The rule book is detailed but I have never had any trouble understanding it.  (Also the designer asides always make me chuckle.)
One of the most played games in my collection even if I haven't played it recently.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Sure, it could be more elegant, and the sequence of play can be confusing, but well worth the effort to learn and play if you're at all interested in the subject.  The GBoH system is geared to showing why certain formations and weapons were successful in their historical context.  It also adds the effects of superior leadership, but that's the least interesting part for me, as high troop morale or experience could beat even a great battle plan or inspirational leadership (Pharsalus, anyone?  Labenius?).  The system has been termed a "valiant failure" by some, but I think it works superbly as a "paper time machine", which is what wargames were meant to be in the first place.  (Not conicidentally, the leadership system looks like it was inspired by an optional rule from an old SPI game.)
I do admit that the game has been greatly improved over the years by adding additional command capabilities and other chrome, so find the 2nd ed. rules, or the current deluxe version rules.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Big game system with six battles and dozens of add on scenarios. I enjoyed figuring out the ways of handling a phalanx or legionary army and had some good fun with this, but the battles tend to look like an explosion in a paint factory with the counters running around out of formation, and Jupiter knows how many counters you needed to stack with each unit. In the end I decided that I had played this to death and sold off the component parts. I preferred DBM. The commentary on the battles was very amusing.

SPQR and its moduled are full of historical referenses that showes you right in to the time of the game. The special leader functions for thi and other GMT games are spectacular. The downsice is that it takes time. Time to learn, time to set up and time to play.

Fourth game - the Vassal experience is tremendous - scalable board, much easier to handle than having to move small counters with my big fingers.

Excellent historical look at ancient warfare. A long game, with lots of bookkeeping; however, it is lots of fun. Plus, how cool is it to lead those ancient armies into battle as Hasdrubal?!?!

Cool ideas, but gameplay suffers from multiple table cross refs. and die rolls for combat resolution.

Just a bit too rules-heavy for me, and too many markers cluttering up the map.

Plays well with the simple rules.

Zama is fun. Otherwise a mixed bag. RHB at his best, good history, and worst, a little bit over the top and unbalanced.

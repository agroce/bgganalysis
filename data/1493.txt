2016-06-23 (rating 7):

Initial rating after two games at rr18xx (http://www.rr18xx.com/).

There wasn't as much of track game as I hope for. But it was probably caused by the fact that in both games I played in the south with SIR (minor, narrow) and was there alone.

This was my first foray into an 18xx game. Perhaps this wasn't the right game for me but it just seemed so mechanical. There was very little stock trading and it just got bogged down by calculations of the best route. Track building generally focused on what brought in the most money and ultimately just felt as if you only made a few decisions and instead the game dictated to you the best move. I appreciate this was part of the original design, but I think Steam does this a lot better and quicker and as such, I don't see myself wanting to play this again.

The fatal problem was regressing to a stockmarket more primitive than found in 1830, or virtually all the 18xx games produced since. Once after five hours play [probably in a 5-player] two of us were in the exact same game position, which must represent a major design problem. I indiciated this to the designer and he agreed. Soon after the [first] expansion set arrived. Gameplay is at the level of pastime, not game, and this situation becomes steadily more & more apparent as the game progresses. Its kinda boring as published, and the worst of 18xx I have played. Much loved by some.

On the one hand it is a really great track laying game with the different gauges, trains and the large area to build over; however, the stock side of the game is lacking and overall it takes too long for what you get, I really like the 1849 implementation of different gauges in a smaller package.

Essentially, the game is weak but it's really fun to play and build a massive railway network empire.

I enjoyed the game, but I can give the game only a 6 for score because I prefer some other 18xx games. So if we decide to play such a game, this will certainly not be the game I will propose. We had a very close finish, so it stayed thrilling until the last moment.
Very nice material from Lookout games, I hope the 1830 rework will be of the same quality.

Based on new edition: first impressions:

There is a lot of chrome on here, but most of it is good.  I don't think I like the portfolio-style 18XX as much as I like the financier-style, but it does have some good merits.

Largely, it is fun to be able to run companies successfully, and be fully rewarded for doing so, but not as much as it is to completely trash a company for personal profit.

The starting cities bond mechanism is a bit contrived, but it encourages early interest in other players' companies.  I think it's a good idea, but maybe there are better ways of accomplishing this?

Dual gauges are awesome, and make track-laying a terribly difficult choice.  Particularly interesting is that you can't upgrade stations to dual-gauge without making them cities (thereby making them count against your train number).

Selling the elephant seems silly, although it seems to be useful to ensure you get your bond back by adding an additional operating round.

RATING: 9
Mayfair's re-tune of a re-tuned 1853. Unfortunately, their quality control is looking rather shoddy these days and this 2009 release is another example of a classic 18XX that has been around for a while - and the silly mistakes on the board and in the rule-book on what is by and large a re-do are an embarrassment. Even a mindless spell check would have caught the majority of the rule book gaffes.

However, none of the QA lapses manage to spoil this excellent game. A straightforward stock market mechanism along with the capitalization rules and destination bonuses make this take on the 18XX engine mostly a exercise in revenue optimization rather than stock manipulation. The components are sturdy and good looking yet utilitarian. I'm not sure I understand why this game sits so low on the Geek list - it is one of the better 18XX offerings in my view.

I'm still awaiting my copy of 1830 which I'm sure I'll continue to enjoy but 1853 provides a refreshing change of pace which I'll be happy to play anytime. I'm glad this one is back!

Can't remember much about this - played a long time ago. I know I didn't like it as much as 1830, game play took ages and I recall bidding which I didn't like, and fixed packets at the start (similar to 1835 which I don't like either). If I had a chance to play it again I'd try and then update the rating, but in no hurry to obtain a copy.

After only one play, I didn't care for it.  It's not a bad game and a bad 18xx is better than most other games.  However, as 18XXs go, I probably won't play this again.  

1. With 3 players, it took us almost 6 hours (admittedly it was the first time I had played it and the other 2 hadn't played it in many years).  I can't imagine how it would play with 5 or 6.

2. I find myself preferring the 1830 stock manipulation side of 18xx and this is clearly in the 1829 efficient R&R running camp.  

3. The start of the game is kind of screwy.  You make a bid for the 3 or 4 cities you plan on competing. You then lose that money until all of those cities are connected and then you start buying shares.  The thing is you have to buy a share that is associated with each city you wrote down.  I just don't get this at all.  

4. There are no privates.  While this isn't a big deal, I've kind of grown to like them.

5. Companies are either Major or Minor.  Major companies can pay an extra $20 ($50 if its the EIR) to lay an additional track.  That's a pretty huge benefit.  The only difference between the majors and minors other than that is that the majors start off with 2 cities (each of which gets a token).  There are 4 (or 5) majors and 3 (or 2) minors depending on the initial bids.  THis also felt kind of wonky to me.

6. in our game, the narrow gauge track didn't really come into play.  I started the 5 company and before I started the 3, I had so much track laid in the north, that there was no reason for the 3 to go into the mountains with it's high terrain costs.  In the south, there might have been a reason for the narrow gauge, but it wasn't used.  I could see this working with more players, but with 3 we had so much control over our little empires that it wasn't necessary.

As I said, it's not a bad game and I'd play it again, but I'd much rather play many other 18XXs first.

RATING: 7
One of the more painful 'xx designs, what with the different
gauges of track and the huge quantity of different tiles
available (and upgrade chart).

You can't really be dumped on - but disposable companies 
can be used to force the trains out at minimal cost.

Game frontloads the most important decision to the very
first actions - the bond selection. If you screw this up,
you're doomed. 

Rules (even the 'cleaned up' lookout ones) are somewhat
difficult - in part due to assumptions about 'xx games
being incorrect for this one. The rules don't help you
out to seeing differences from '30-based games.


Still, this does end up a very interesting entry into the field.

Take my comments with a pinch of salt: 18XX is probably not my type of game. That said, I find it way too long (6+ hours) for what it is. 1853 focuses on laying track, but in that regard Age of Steam is shorter and more interesting to me.

RATING: 5
18xx does not particularly simulate building a rail system, but does convey some sense of (a) how it developed in a given area and (b) how capital appreciates.  Also, co-dependency is low, as a bad player is likely to be marginal to the final result

The Achilles heel is the endgame, which can seem interminable.  Also, the objective is easy to grasp and the mechanics not particularly hard, but the rules are fairly complex and quite fiddly.

Even after 4 hours we were nowhere near finished - but we did get far enough on to start to get a feel for some of the impact of the main differences from more standard 18xx (1830 is my reference point). 

First impressions are that it very much lives up to its billing as a game for engineers and not financiers, with two separate track types opening up new ways to make things difficult for your opponents and a wheen of double town spaces putting a premium on getting there first to make sure those un-upgradeable tiles are laid with an orientation that suits you; plus there's a limited supply of grey tiles to upgrade to after brown, adding another lap to that leg of the race.

In contrast to all that potential for track laying shenanigans the stock market is a very placid straight line affair - shares can increase quickly with profitable runs but it's pretty hard, if not quite impossible, to end up with a decrease in price - even after shares have been dumped. 

Hard game to rate on a first play but the stock market is too tame and the game too long for my tastes - probably very long, even for an 18xx - and so will likely never be a favourite for me.

RATING: 9
Interestingly, this remains one of my favorite 18xx games, although there is an [i]extremely[/i] important caveat: we play with all the "missing" standard tile configurations (small city/curve, several variations on green single-station cities), 2 extra 2M trains, as well as the alternate start for the BB&CI from the expansion kit. All these minor changes hurt the EIR a little, and the net effect is to more or less equalize the first 5 railways and make for an excellent game, much better than is generally appreciated. It's also just the right length, 4-5 hours with reasonably quick play, which is right in the comfort zone. Most post-1830 games add complexity & length to the point where they take too long to play. The expansion kit is somewhat amusing, and I always meant to try it once, but I guess it's just a bit too wierd.

Some tips for new players:
1) I think the sweet spot in terms of player count is 4 or 5. 6, I think, is too tight.  3 to thin. I suspect 5 is best, but 4 is fine too.
2) Play the short game first, as described in the rules. 1853 isn't difficult, but like the other, bigger 18xx games it really benefits from some familiarity. The best way to get it is just to play a game of the short version first. The opening contract bids, while far less punishing than private company auctions in the 1830-style games, is still something you just have to see how it plays out once to really grok how it works; best to do it with a short game.
3) There is no legitimate opening bid that includes shares of a minor in my opinion, other than a play to make the BB&CI a major (and, therefore, not minor shares; the BB&CI is a strong alternative to the NWR early as a major, but far too weak as a minor). Never, ever take a share of MSM, SIR, or ECR in the opening bid. The new Lookout/Mayfair version has beefed up the strength of the "minor" companies by adding M trains and giving them some out-of-the-gate options, but this is mostly over-correction; these companies are weaker than the majors, and the 1Ms are, in my opinion, a false choice - they should never see play. You are not going to win the game buying minor-company shares early. You need to get some shares in EIR and GIP to win. Meter-gauge railroads may play a part in your mid-game strategies, but not in the opening.
4) GIP, however, has legitimate meter-gauge options in the south early which should be seriously considered. You just need to wait for a 2M, but it shouldn't be long. NWR also has a legitimate meter gauge option in the north if they start on OR1. *If* the GIP opens early withe meter gauge in the south, the MSM can be a strong mid-game player with meter. But not an opener.
---
There are some not-great glitches in the new Mayfair/Lookout version, a few errors in the rules, and a misprint on the map (the BNR and NWR have their positions reversed), but in general the new version of 1853 is a great update of a classic game. Many of the problems with the original (which we had always houseruled anyway) have been fixed, the missing track tiles have been supplied, and the minor imbalance in the meter-gauge train availability fixed. All of which allow 1853 to be the great game I always thought it was. As I've decisively moved away from the 1830/1856 branch of the 18xx family and into 1825/1829/1853, I really appreciate the nuance and subtlety of 1825 and 1853, and much prefer them. 1853 is not quite as clean as 1825, there is definitely a bit of grit (mostly introduced by over-correcting), and it's definitely a touch long, but the length comes down with some play and this a game that does a ton of stuff right.

I don't like this as much as some of the other 18xx I've played (e.g. 1830, 1856).  It feels far more sensitive to initial start, with far less chance to affect/recover from the lead of another player.  And, far less interactive due to the almost completely stable stock market.

RATING: 9
A sedate version of 18XX, slow paced, and focusing more on train and track building rather than stock market. It's a game where you really want to play the companies rather than stock manipulating. Probably the best 18XX from 1829 line. 

Specialties:
- No privates, but bidding for contract bond of making route of specific cities
- 8 companies, some major, some minor
- 2(3) different tracks that can be run by specific train
- A lot of small town
- 1D stock market
- Selling or buying shares NEVER adjust price.

The initial, pre-planned cash outlay for different cities seems overwrought, for what little impact it has on the overall outcome of the game, but other than that, I find 1853 very enjoyable.  I particularly like the option to build narrow- and dual-gauge rail.

My first foray into 18xx territory. We played with an electronic accountant thingy that mostly kept track of the finances, and I guess that probably made a few things a little more opaque to me as the new player than they should have been. Even taking that into account the rules seemed to be somewhat convoluted, with lots of exceptions and special cases.

Still, it's been an interesting experience, and one that I'd like to repeat. What I'm not quite so sure about, though, is long-term appeal when you take the time commitment into account. In our game I realized about half-way through that I'd committed a few mistakes that would take me out of the running (although it later turned out it wasn't quite as bad as I had thought). In this case, it was still very interesting just to see how things unfolded, but I'd attribute this to the fact that everything was still new and shiny. Once the novelty factor has worn off, will I still be happy about sitting at a board for 3 more hours when I know the game is already over?

RATING: 7
(12/26/2012) An interesting 18XX variant that emphasizes track laying strategies, while nerfing the stock manipulation aspect.

The track laying in 18XX is usually an already complicated affair, with elements of area control, blocking, and track topography, constituting another "metagame" within a metagame. This is further convoluted with the introduction of narrow, normal, and combined gauge track, resulting in three different sets of track tiles, as well as two different types of trains (i.e., the regular and the "M" trains). The narrow gauge track is cheaper to build through non-plain hexes--India is full of expensive-to-build terrain--which is an advantage for the four minor companies given their successively lower capitalizations. The four major companies can lay both too, but are incentivized to build normal gauge track.

Stock manipulation is virtually non-existent, as selling does not drop the stock price of a company like in other 18XXs. The only way a share price can drop is if a company withholds AND there are outstanding shares in the "bankpool" (where stock go after being sold at market). Otherwise, the share price can go up 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 steps, depending on how many multiples the income exceeds the share price. Thus, players need not worry about having their company shares "trashed" by another player. Money is plentiful, where few witholds are necessary, as there is a "mail run" that feeds the company's treasury every operating round.

The opening bid is another interesting twist from other 18XX variants, where players bid a "bond" amount, which they will get back upon fulfilling a secret objective. This consists of specifying four or more cities on the map that must be connected by track, regardless of ownership or company. The four or more cities are also tied to what initial shares of the eight companies are bought by the players. While it is possible to get a majority of shares in a particular company, this then incentivizes the player to layout track to meet his objective, which may not necessarily be the most economic or lucrative route(s).

While this variant was interesting, the lack of stock manipulation made the game a bit dull and dry, as it was missing the tension present in most other 18XX variants. The multiple gauge track tiles and train types was also interesting, but was not novel enough to make our group continue playing beyond four hours. We will have to try it again, but it may be awhile before this comes back to the table. It is a solid '7'.

Of all the 18xx's currently on sale, this probably comes closest to the original, 1829. The opening bids/bond idea is probably the best part of this incarnation as it injects a lot of variety into the start, although it's a lot to get your head around and creates no end of confusion for new players. The broad gauge/metre gauge gimmick doesn't quite come off as no sensible company will operate both and so land themselves with a double train rush. I'm very much a fan of the 1825 units, even in combination, but 1853 strangely leaves me cold, possibly because just eight companies compete for routes on a large map with inevitably low interaction. There are also a lot of hard-to-remember special rules. The 1829 system works very well in 1825, this just increases playing time without adding compensating interest.

I played the first edition once, using the non-contract revised rules from the expansion set.  We played with no $500s in the bank, as suggested by the author.  Even so, the game ran 5 hours.

I liked it.  I think 1830 is a better game, but make no mistake, 1853 is a good game.  I suspect I need to play more of 1830 to fully appreciate the variance of 1853.  The lack of stock manipulation is a big change, allowing you to pay more attention to the track.  And in this game, the track is weird.  Thee is broad gauge and metric track.  Further, the metric track is cheaper, and has a better assortment of normal configurations.

The home regions are a bit hard to cope with, I wish these had been encoded into the map in some way.

The intermediate phases seem to fly by a bit too fast.  The rusting of the '2' train seems to happen rather quickly.  And the revised rule allowing a full trade in on old locomotives seems too kind.

So, I think this is a mixed bag.  I liked the map, I enjoyed the kinder stock market.  But some of the rest made the game harder than I thought it should be.  I will revisit this game again, but I think I will first dawdle through additional 1830 games.

Last (and only) Play:  Feb. 2009  (on first edition)

EDIT:  March, 2014: Finally got back to this game.  We played on the reprint.  And more importantly, I am now a much more experienced 18xx player.  My estimation of this game jumped significantly.  I see a lot of replayability in this game with the unique contract bid start.  I enjoy the games where you can make double, triple or even better jumps on the market due to excellence in revenue generation.

I'm now keen on this title, and have tracked down a copy of the new version.

We even managed to play this a second time in March, 2014.  And shock of shocks, I won!  I am often the punching bag around here for 18xx games, so this victory was savored.

I enjoyed the game mostly as a silent partner for over half of the game.  I bid the minimum, and simply followed companies that I knew would float.  The other players had enough money ted up in the contract bids, that I was able to get a share count advantage in the early game.  This made for a nice income.  Finally I opened one of the minors, and enjoyed a nice return on it.  I never did earn my contract bid back.  Interesting game experience.  I really like this game!

I have the rare 1st ed. and the 2nd ed. available for trade. (I plan to keep one.)

This 18xx game focuses more on "engineering" than "finance".  A nice variation, I haven't played it enough to really enjoy it.  I am looking forward to the Mayfair games remake

The 18xx for engineers. Focus is indeed on track building, but buying the good shares is also very important. Not much stockmarket action. Slow progress in the train evolution. Longish - first play was 7 hours.

RATING: 6
I like some of the more original elements (like how the priority holder can extend the OR set and the option to sell the priority), not sure how I feel about fiddling around with the track gauges. The length is a bit off-putting, since it feels quite samey throughout, and a little off-balance with the BNR being too strong. Playing online is easy enough, but it doesn't get too much face to face play because of the length. I'm afraid this will remain an "rr18xx.com only" game for me.

RATING: 8
An almost complete reversal of 1830.  Here the focus is on route building, and the stock market is less volatile.  Players trying to manipulate the stock market to cause financial harm to their opponents will be hard-pressed to do so.  In fact, players need to co-operate with each other in some respects, as each railroad is limited in its geographic presence, with some parts of India exclusively held by one railroad, while other parts are shared between up to 4 of them.

Benefits greatly from the MIK2 kit, which removes the "contract bidding" and structured offering of shares.

After one long game of [i]1853[/i] and one short game, it was my favorite "new to me" game of June 2010. Of course, it was the only "new to me" game of June 2010. For one of my gaming buddies (who happened to win both games), it's his claimed favorite.  While I enjoy [i]1853[/i], I may just like [i]1825[/i] better.

After 2 games, I am loving this one. Very different in feel. Expansive and constructive,  huge options for early companies and real chances to build up your fiefdoms and then connect them. I like this 18xx -- the train rush is serious but not the entire point of the game. There is time to save up money, get good trains, and catch the leaders. The different track makes for some challenging options. Would love to play with the second extension kit some day.

I really like 18xx and this is the one I've played most because it copes best with my group size. I haven't played with the Retuned rules yet, but I intend to give it a go next time that I play. I also want to try with fewer players than the usual 5/6 that I play with; perhaps that will reduce the tendency for the player who takes the President share in EIR to win. I hope so.

One of only two 18XX games I own - favoured to 1829. Nice track building, and improved with the expansion kits. Did not find any problem with the stockmarket element - can anyone be more specific who more familiar with the spread of 18XX games. Game length a problem - we cannot get under 6 hours.  

That said Railway Rivals gets played ten times more than either of them which must say something significant!

Probably too many fiddly, needless rules to add historical chrome (dual track gauge, visually difficult restrictions on hex placement, peculiar connection bonuses).  I love most 18xx games, but this one is perhaps an overly complicated implementation of the system.  I don't think it comes in at the advertised 3 hours as a result.

A different kind of 18xx where main focus is on track building and the game overall has more gentle nature - there is no mandatory train buying and no restricitons of what shares can you sell back to the bank for example. All those changes provide opportunities for new kind of scheming and strategies of course. The track building and company management is rich in choices as there are two different gauges of track available and these need different types of trains also.

Rating for the 2009 edition which omits the large part of Imperial India to the east of Calcutta and removes the historical formation of the 8 major railways.

This game can easily be lost at the beginning with the Contract bidding and first share dealing round.  (When playing for the first time, allow anyone to ask to start again after a couple of ORs - this will allow everyone to enjoy this excellent game.)

I prefer the 1989 1st edition with the whole of Imperial India and its truer historical feel. Unlimited yellow tiles are allowed, and the map and tile graphics are better.  The 1st edition also has optional rule 19 that makes the Contract bidding and first SDR easier for people unfamiliar with 1953.

Dec. 4, 2010, one learning, three player game of the lookout Games edition that ended a bit after the start of phase 3. We are all relatively experienced 18xx players.

Very conflicted on what to think about this game. Very slow opening. I blame partly on our inexperience in the game and the fact that we played this with only 3. However, I'm comparing this to to my last 18xx game, which is 1841. In that game phase phase 3 trigger during the second or third round with each corporation awash with money. In our game of 1853, it simply took forever to get all those two trains sold off to trigger the phase 3. What made it even tougher is that only two players focused on major companies!

Track laying, though is very amusing! There are so many "essential" tiles that are missing, which makes planning rail lines surprising for those accustomed to more "standard" versions of 18xx. Also, the meter, standard, and double gauge tracks all have different tile mixes. For example, there are *no* straight, yellow city tiles for meter gauge! You have to (a) build a dead-end yellow city tile, then upgrade it to green. Unfortunately, by the time track laying got interesting, we had to stop the game.

I don't think the opening auction added a bit too much complexity to the effect it has on the game. Players reserve a secretly decided amount of money. Whoever reserved the most (as a bond) gets it back if that player connects the cities he has written down (secretly) at the start of the game. The amount of the bond has to be equal or slightly more than number of cities that the player decided he wants to connect.

At least the auction "balances" the advantage of going first, like most other 18xx games. However, winning the auction doesn't give you an interesting power like other 18xx games. Also, the initial shares a player *must* purchase at the start of the game depend on which cities he chose to connect. This forces players to diversify right at the start of the game. But players have the choice to sell some of those initial shares right away, so what was the point of forcing players to diversity in the first place? One reason why this might work is because corporations float when 60% of a corporation has been *issued*, not simply in the players' hands. So that 60% include those stocks that have been sold and are sitting there in the bank pool.

My favourite 18xx games so far are 1841 and 1856. I love how those games focus on stock market values and the careful management of corporation assets -- I prefer the financial part of 18xx games most. 1853 is definitely not about the stock market stocks never drop if any are sold. And stock values drop only if a corporation withholds dividends *and* there are still stocks available for purchase in the IPO. 

As for components, I don't think the board is attractive, but the tiles are. The stocks and trains are printed on standard mini playing cards, but unfortunately, the tracks are printed on the same thin cardstock as the AH version of 1830.

I definitely have to play this one more time to "fix" the stupid mistakes I did during that weird bond purchasing phase. Also I want to play a whole game because I have a feeling track laying gets far more interesting later in the game.

This is what the original designer came up with as his further thoughts on the 18xx system. Unlike most of the other variants, it eschews the stock manipulations and concentrates on the rail-building aspects of the game. It does this very well, and is my favorite of the series.

My first 18xx game (besides Splotter's 1830BC). I liked the railbuilding quite a lot, but was a bit underwhelmed by the stock market (neither buying or selling stock has an impact on its price). Some aspects feel very gamey, as for example that you can found companies and just use all their capital to buy a good train and sell it cheaply to your "main" company. In total this games takes a bit too long for what it is.

Great components, and an enjoyable stocking picking / track-laying game. Though I much prefer the 1830 branch, I like this as a change of pace. Should take about 5-6 hours with experienced players and poker chips.

RATING: 7.5
The "building rails" part is predominant on the economical one, so it could play somehow different from other 18XX games. Nonetheless, it's a great game. Only two cons: the rulebook is really badly worded / structured so that several readings are necessary in order to get the gameflow correct, and games tend to be longish (7+ hours), so they are ok for a rainy Sunday, but not for an evening with friends.

It's not the greatest 18xx.  Due to the nature of finances and how they differ from say, 1830, 1861, or 1846, the game is certainly less tense, and in 18xx that's not a good thing, in my opinion.  Still a decent game.

Played again, with the minor rules adjustments from MIK2 (different starting procedure, 2 companies available at a time, possible to move up several steps on the stock market, can sell trains in phase 4) and adding the missing tile #58 - and had great fun!

a fairly interesting branch of the 18xx tree, in an unusual location.  India is so mountainous, that it makes track laying very expensive.  The introduction (start) of the game is unique (to me at least) in the way of "starter packages", but definitely not friendly to new players, as it is a secret bid and easy to mess up -- and the error can be not found for quite some time.  the stock system is simple and fun, like 1825.  In those two related games, i prefer the length of 1825 to this, which is more typical 18xx length of 4 to 5 hours.  Good game.

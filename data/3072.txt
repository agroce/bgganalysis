A brilliant miniature wargame of gang fights. My favourite of this genre, definitely (and pretty much the only one I ever managed to finish an army for, since you only need a dozen or so minis.. [size=7]Of course, it got cancelled by the greedy bastards at GW for this very reason - not enough £££ for the miniature sales![/size] :shake:)

Based on the old 2nd edition WH40k rules, it's a bit cumbersome at times, but I love the theme and the RPG-like experience elements that allow your gangers to grow into different personalities during a campaign. Granted, it's a totally random dicefest, but it's a ton of fun.. and I just love painting and converting the minis for this game!

TABLETOP MINIATURE WARGAME

Ideally suited to campaign play. Not a lot of miniatures needed. Decent strategy, but can still degenerate to a dice-fest.

Warhammer 40k setting, but instead of galactic battles we move to the crumbling underbelly of a hive city that reaches a mile into the sky.  Down in the corridors and abandoned sections of the city you lead a small group of outcasts in search of personal power and wealth.

Used the old 40k rules with additions of individual gang member advancement through XP  and equipment.  On the flip side, it supports perma-wounds and death and can be quite unforgiving.

A very good, short and quick battle in the 40K universe. Does not take as long as the standard 40K battles. Don't need to spend as much, which includes painting lesser and faster time to get them on the table.

The RPGS part will interest those type of gamers.

Overall, a good package that is open for expansion. Due to the numbers of different models and weapons set, the game becomes a gem.

My most played miniature game of all time.  The 2nd edition WH40k rules fit Necromunda like a glove.  Only downside is there was zero play testing for the expansions gangs and they are horribly unbalanced.  Stick to vanilla Necro.  Although ... Hexes > Squares > Measurements.  Whereas if you asked me in 1995 I would have said the opposite.  My how times have changed.

Maybe impossible to rate that one. If you have the right group of crazy hobbyists (it's more a hobby than only a game) to make long campaigns, this is simply one of the biggest blast in the universe. I enjoyed that a lot when i was younger.

On the other hand, i can easily see how someone cas hate it: massive rules, so much luck and dice involved it will give you a headache, really costy when you want to customize your gang... So i prefer not rate it at all, because it deserves 1 to 9, depênding on your situation and your aspirations. To me it has been a 9, but this is too subjective to make it a note.

+ Great 80's 90's cyberpunk theme. Love the combination of a skirmish game with leveling up. Cover mixed with high terrain height makes for interesting fights. Skills make it fun. Close combat is fun and you normally know who's going to win. Hitting with shooting without wounding is still important tactically.

Pues bueno... pos vale. Juego de escaramuzas, el primero que recuerdo. Lo nejor fue la inclusión de una nueva forma de elaborar  miniaturas en plastico con muchos más detalles que hasta ese momento. Las reglas estaban bien pero daban pié a muchisimos problemas sobre todo en cuanto a la linea de visión... recuerdo autenticos piques... La ampliación de juego permitia elaborar ligas y mejorar las bandas... El juego incluía edificios de cartón... todo un avance para el universo del w40k. No estaba mal la verdad...

I really liked this game in it's heyday.  Then there were all sorts of expansions, and stupid gangs and all sorts of crap that kinda put it over the edge for me.  Enron and I played a ton of this over his custom terrain and basic sets, we even modded our minis to reflect the weaponry on the model.  Lots of cool games, lots of people getting shot off of bridges and falling to their deaths.  No idea where my models are anymore, but I do know where the books and terrain are!

Another GW ploy to sell tons of miniatures that was runied by countless unplaytested expansions.  The original game is sort of what the ORIGINAL 40k was supposed to be like.  Small teams with 10-20 models per side.  Which is one of the reasons why 40k is broken.  It is pretty fun to play, and the experince for the gangs are pretty cool.  Terrain is neat, but it's difficult to reach inside of it and the idea of 'cover' is very subjective.  Played, but would never own.  It has some really stupid game mechanics.  I once saw a ganger fall 3 stories onto a concrete floor, after being knocked off by a shotgun, and he jumped up and ran away without a scratch.   It has problems.

Just outrageously fun. My first experience with tabletop games of any kind and arguably what made me the glorious weirdo that I am today. Some of the most balanced mechanisms you'll find in any game it's a damn shame that Games Workshop killed it like it did. 

Since the game has been discontinued, you're going to pay a pretty penny to get the original figures on eBay (about $3 - $6.50 per figure). However if you're playing casual, any 28mm figures will probably work. 

As far as terrain goes, there is basically one company that still makes anything close the original (Wargames Tournaments) but I would NOT recommend them if you live outside the UK. Getting them shipped here to New York was a 2.5 month process where I had to pay more for the shipping than the (admittedly awesome) terrain that I received. You're better off going to your local craft store (after looking up how-tos on YouTube) and building your own terrain. Personally, I think it's half-the fun.

Finally, there's a very active community on YakTribes.com that has a lot of the original source material (in PDF) as well as additional fun scenarios and the like that they've created/posted since it's been discontinued.

All in - I think it's the best tabletop skirmish game out there. I'm sure some people would disagree and I'd actually probably agree with some of their critiques. But for my money, so.....damn....good.

Definitely one of GW's better efforts.  I'm not usually a fan of their stuff (it's typically massively overpriced and horribly under-playtested) but this one, along with their most recent outing of Bloodbowl, really does get my vote.  It's cool.  It's messy.  It's violent.  Great stuff.

40k as it was meant to be: simple quick skirmishes, but the masterful stroke of this game is the gang experience. This takes the game to the same levels of anticipation as a roleplaying game with characters earning experience, gaining new kit or even ... dying. 

To this end it is very similar as the Blood Bowl League however, to my mind BB just pips it as it is more humorous.

RATING: 8.75
Classic miniature game that made full use of the 40k system in a skirmish setting.  Campaign mode was unparalleled and the model count on the table was perfect.  Only drawback is it requires a decent amount of players to get a campaign going and the tables require a ton of terrain to get the gameplay just right.

The old boxed set did come with some fantastic 3d Cardstock terrain.  The included plastic Goliaths/Orlocks were of great quality for the time (they're still useful for filling out your gangas today).

RATING: 5
The terrain is really cool and makes for a fun first couple of games. The idea of having a gang that improves game by game is good but the execution is bad. Random tables determine how gangers improve so a guy shoots someone from long range and gains the ability to disarm an opponent in close combat. The random nature means that some gangs just get better than others and if you play against a gang that has played five more games than you they will be twice as good and wipe the floor. The houses are unbalanced: Van Saar are the best by far. The game gets quite boring to play quickly. It is just a bunch of guys with guns versus another bunch of guys with guns.

One of the GW offshoot games that I really enjoyed. Unlike FB you need fewer models, thus it's much easier to justify; though, like most tabletop games, it still has a fair degree of 'fiddlyness'. Very well done long term campaign system too, which only adds to the replay value.

I currently rate this a 6 because I'm not all that fond of mini games in general though, and I doubt that I would want to get into a campaign again, or to deal with the GW model-based hassle anymore.

If you are a mini fan, or you're thinking about it, this used to be a great place to start though. Low initial investment cost, even for the person buying the big box, and the number of models each player needed to bring to the table was manageable and actually, god forbid, portable, which was always a huge issue for our Fantasy Battle group. Of course, GW being GW, this game is long out of mainstream print, which means you have to buy direct, which is, of course, much more expensive than it would be if it was available in the right stores (i.e.: stores which discount without mentioning it to GW, I paid 40% off retail for this game when I was into it, which made it very, very inexpensive). Even buying direct, this is cheaper than anything else they offer other than perhaps Blood Bowl. For my money, this is better, but it depends on what you're looking for.

The great tragedy of miniatures wargames is that the producers aren't interested in making solid games, they want to sell you tons of lead.  So, it's no surprise that this very solid rule set basically failed - you only needed 1 squad!  You get an easy to get into game with a great built in campaign system and GWs fantastic background.

The Warbands for 40K game. This game saw copious amounts of game play when biggdork and I were stranded in dirty San Diego with no money and no other friends. I still look back very fondly at it. The campaign system was very cool, although it could get unbalanced at times. The first minis game that I really got into serious terrain building. The game play was a quick skirmish style with lots of nooks and hiding and scampering about while things 'splode. Great fun. Busted it out not too long ago with enoto and had great fun. One of the few GW games I will still bust out without guilt.

RATING: 6
The campaign rules for this game are the single greatest thing.  Awesome system for keeping the same gang of miniatures in play and plenty of random tables to keep development interesting.  Other systems offer better skirmish level rules for individual battles but nothing comes close to the long term campaign system.

Over time have found I can't get into the game the same way I did when I played my first campaign

This was a great, fun experience, but only because I had a friend who knew all of the rules who was the game master. There is no way I could remember all of these rules and small edge cases. The whole thing was a pretty random experience, not much strategy involved. It was more like a tabletop RPG, where the decisions you make don't really matter that much because winning and losing doesn't matter, you're just along for a ride.

While I don't have my gangs anymore... I used to play this quite a bit. My gang of choice was the Delaques. If I remember correctly, they were named after Monty Python people and one had a rocket launcher that had a big target on him because of the destruction that would ensue.I did like the game very much as it was a change from normal 40k stuff. The unique play of the gang and keeping the stats organized was fun too.

I think the second edition 40k rules are pretty awful for the unit-based battles game that they were designed to be used with. The most glaring example I can think of off the top of my head is hand-to-hand combat, which was always a mess because of the dice-rolling and stat-checking. Moving hordes of loosely organized models was also a bit of a pain. However, those same rules work quite well here in the much smaller-in-scope Necromunda. Having only ten or so (usually less) models to worry about makes each combat seem a lot more rewarding, and the strategic investment in each move or action feels much more immediate. 

Where the game really shines is the advancement system, which is basically an abridged roleplaying system. Characters earn experience and gain stat increases or new abilities, so your veteran gangers can turn into powerful fighters if they survive a few fights. The injury system is also quite fun, and encourages much more conservative strategies for campaign play. Watching a gang grow in power and personality is great fun and makes you want to come back to the game again and again. 

Necromunda is a lot less expensive than most other miniature-based games made by Games Workshop. You need far less models for your gang than you would for a full army, which also means that you can put more time into painting and converting individual models (if that's your thing). My gangs were almost always made up of converted Imperial Guard miniatures rather than the official Necromunda models because I enjoyed messing around with the figures so much. 

There are some balance problems and redundancy in the weapons and other rules. Do we really need auto-weapons and las-weapons considering how similar they both are? I don't think I've ever seen someone use auto-weapons for their gang. Perhaps they belong for flavor purposes, but I wish that there had been more variety between these two weapon sets so that it felt like a bigger choice when fitting out a gang. I also feel like bolt weapons should be more expensive, or maybe even a rare trades item given their manufacture in the 40k setting.

RATING: 9
Feels a lot like 2000 AD as a skirmish game. Based on 2nd edition 40k, so there's a lot of wonkiness in terms of modifiers to hit, to save, and how each type of item works, but because it's basically an advancement based, pseudo-RPG style battles game, that attention to detail can actually be fun and rewarding. The gangs in the basic set don't have a lot to distinguish one another as far as mechanics go, but that probably helps with balance. 

Campaigns can be a blast. Getting new skills, items, and even injuries adds a lot to a gang's identity, and rewards player investment moreso than "one and done" modes of play. The series injuries table has been poached buy quite a few games since this went away. 

Expansions and magazine/journal articles added new gangs and scenarios. I think it's probably easy enough to homebrew your own ideas, though, especially if you have any experience with 40k. 

The 3D terrain is amazing and really added a lot to the game.

One of Games Workshop's best.  The campaigns are a blast, and the rich diversity of gang types sets the mind ablaze with possibilities.  And for a Games Workshop game, the price isn't too outrageous...at least, it wouldn't be if the various miniatures were still in print.  Nowadays, each miniature can run you a good $20 a pop.  I do so miss my gang of badly-painted Scavvies!

Why does GW dangle such fun before me then abandon all support for game after game?  This game is great if you get the expansions and really build up your gang by fighting loads of friends gangs.  One time games are okay, but lack the fun of building up a guy and the anguish at watching him get his head blown off.

Ah... Necromunda.  Great set of light skirmish rules, but a little bit clumsy since it's based on a larger set of battles rules.  Also the campaign rules have some really brutal random events and wound results.

Also has the big plus of only needing a small army, usually 5 to 15 figs.

RATING: 5
Pros:
- great miniatures and buildings right out of the box
- great use of space, with multi-storey buildings and loads of confined spaces to hide.
- each faction has a different set of abilities
- plenty of missions
- loads of fun

Cons:
- maybe that by current standards the mechanics are a bit dated, even though they are very solid.
- the rule book is quite thick. The rules are quite complex.
- quite expensive to buy new factions

Small squad skirmish game. This was a somewhat cheaper alternative to WH40k when I was a teen. It had similar rules, but also rules for campaign play and only a handful of units per side.

The setting and components are what really struck a chord for me with this. It wasn't as sterile as some of WH40k seemed. No "super-soldiers"...just people living in squalor trying to irk out a living in the shadowy wastelands under a spire on a polluted planet. There is a possibility that this sleeps in my subconscious as my 'grail game'...but I haven't revisited it in years so I cannot be certain.

I really wish they would make a box set for this again. Or lend it out to another game company to do.

Ok, the first time I played this it lasted 10 seconds.  A grenade launcher killed 2 guys, the gang fails it's bottle check and runs away.  Yawn.  As with other campaign-based GW games, it becomes pointless to play after a few games, as some gangs gain power while others just get weaker.

Solid Mini's game. Legacy/League play before it was popular. My other favorite GW title (Blood Bowl is first) - It has a feel of Infinity, but the legacy element makes this on par at least.

RATING: 6
Nice idea, that has been ruined with unbalanced gangs, and VERY unrewarding campaign system. The bail out option is just too useful. You can have your whole gang in the sickbay, and still gain nothing. Even if you win the fight, that is. And to the next fight we go, with the crippled paraplegics, that used to be a gang...

A miniatures game of futuristic gang members fighting for turf in a three dimensional under-city. This game is fun to play on it's own, but is much better in campaign mode. Gang members improve, gain injuries, or die throughout the campaign. Each gang becomes a unique entity. The scenarios and gangs aren't usually balanced (adding to the excitement). This is a deep game with great flavor and high intensity. Each game pits two players against each other, but countless players can be involved in a campaign.

Several plays.  I loved Necromunda (along with several other major GW releases) when it was new.  It was great - you had a small gang you played in a campaign setting, where you could advance individual gang members?  Cool!  But, for me, it suffered from many of the same problems I have with other GW games - too many rules needed player interpretation, leading to arguments or worse.

Better than the usual GW madness.  The clunky mechanics and "gothic style" remain, but on a squad level, it's a little easier to take.  The terrain buildings are the high point.  Back in the day I bought one, sold off the figures and dice for cost, and kept the buildings for free!

This game in a campaign setting is a lot of fun.  Your gang can improve over time from battle to battle.  A small investment (maybe 15 figs) is required compared to other miniatures games.

I rate CCGs and their expandable cousins (LCGs, etc.) on this basis: "I will never invest in one again, but assuming that someone else hands me a deck here's what I think of the game."

I have the same basic complaints about Necromunda that I do about the other GW games I've tried and watched, one gameplay-based and one peripheral. The peripheral one is that I hate painting minis, with the exception of classic BattleTech units (and even that was never a huge interest); I'm not the target audience for GW games in general.

The gameplay complaint is more significant for me, because if it weren't there and I knew friends would get into it as well, I could muddle through the painting. The real problem is that the game system just plain sucks. It sucks less in Necromunda than in 40K, but the suck is still there.

I did enjoy the small unit tactics and the scenery, and I think if I'd built my own team from the ground up and played a few more times, I might feel differently about Necromunda overall.

Very cool desperate feeling when playing this game. Everybody counts. Even the new guy who is only carrying a lead-pipe and 2 rounds for his revolver that has a good chance to explode in his hand if he ever tried to fire it anyway.

My personal favorite.  Not as expensive to get into as 40K and more fun.  Great gang warfair.  Its fun to modify the game and run campaigns. Table top wargameing at its finest.

I found Necromunda to be a bit too fiddly and rules heavy for what it's worth.  I prefer Mordheim.  The miniatures are good though.

RATING: 7
Way back when this game was new it seemed like the perfect game. I loved miniatures wargaming, but the investment was prohibitive, and arranging a game was a lot of work. As a skirmish game this seemed to solve that, and the RPG-like stat building elements sometimes had my friends and I pulling all-nighters. Have recently expanded the old gang that was collecting dust in the cupboard, reassembled all the game components, built extra scenery and bought an extra gang.

RATING: 4
Good for a GW game, perhaps their best (I have not tried Blood Bowl or Gorka Morka, though Space Hulk wasn't bad.) but quite long and with some balance issues. The games are tactical, but the purchases for your gang are strategic. 

The bureaucracy phase at the end of a session is the part with interesting decisions, but the system is let down by overly random outcomes from things such as fighting (roll to hit, roll to wound, ammo rolls), roll to see whether injured fighters get up again,  leadership rolls, income rolls, permanent injury rolls, gain 1D6 XP rolls, rare item rolls etc. 

In other words, randomness shoe-horned in at every opportunity, as if the designers thought this was a positive thing "because rolling dice is fun." Actually, Jervis, the opposite is true. Rolling dice to see if you do well or not is boring - it's like snakes and ladders.

Inclusion of the Outlanders supplement is highly recommended, but not essential.

I really like the small footprint it needs, but it is still a miniatures game.  But, it doesn't take over.  So GW got rid of it.  Of course.  But luckily they are bringing it back, but I think that I would prefer Shadow War.  I really like the idea of bringing in other races.

This game takes be back to a lot of good times.  Actually it is quite fun to play.  Build and try to 'maintain' a gang over a series of games with enough of everything they need to survive.  Gang members tend to gain better and more expensive equipment as well as superior skills however they also get crippling injuries as a balancing effect.  A gang that's  been played a bit becomes increasingly more complex to play as each member becomes more and more of an individual character or they die and your gang gets smaller and smaller.

There is no real way to play the game once and experience the designed thrill.

One of the two best game GW ever made. This and Mordheim are essentially the same thing, just ones Fantasy based and the other Sci-Fi.

Both are excellent. But beware the high cost of getting into these at such a late stage in the game if you intend to buy "official" Gw models and terrain for them as they have been out of print for ages.

If however you and your opponent don't mind proxying other cheaper figures and scenery and using the free downloadable rules still available of GW's website, then why arn't you playing this RIGHT NOW! Really, these games are EXCELLENT FUN!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Best in a multi-gang campaign with lots of folks.  Also best if you ignore the "House Weapons" restriction list added for the living rulebook, as it introduces a ton of unbalance into an otherwise pretty balanced game.

RATING: 10
Along with Warhammer Quest, Necromunda is one of the few games that I believe deserves a 10.  The ability to customize your gang, the vastly different terrain layouts each time, and the leveling up of your characters after each fight was mind blowing when I first played this in the mid-90s.  The mark of a great game is the stories you remember from playing it and I have still talk with my friends about games we played over 15 years ago!  The theme of the game oozes from the models, the terrain, the rules, and the rule book.  It's still around and worth a play.

The original boxed version came with plenty of 3D terrain and two plastic gangs at a good price. Have adapted the rules for different skirmish type games, including the one I play the most, centered on spaceship boarding actions (space pirate battles, if you will, rather than underhive gang fights).
My main problem with the original rules is the amount of between-fight bookkeeping required, which can take longer than the actual fighting.

Still one of my favorite GW games.  Only takes a small squad of 10-12 minis to play, supports a good multi-player campaign mode with character advancement, and can use all your 40K terrain.  If there is a con-side, it's that the game is more Blood-Bowlesque, and not really meant to be a serious wargame.  I watched a ganger fall3 stories and walk away!  Lotta fun, but leave the realism at home.

The 1st edition of this game is great! One of my favorite miniatures game due to its huge punk influence. 

The 2nd edition (or "Underhive" edition) isn't worth it. I'd track down a copy of the rules with the hazard stripes on the cover (either hardcover single book, or two softcover books).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
An outstanding game overall.  Just finished a year-long campaing with three other gamers.  Players MUST have a strong understanding of the rules; deviating from them really causes problems.  We found games to be the most fun when we had as much terrain on the tabletop as possible: anything will do, from old buildings to crumbling walls, pools, towers, what have you so long as you have a lot of debris.  Open spaces make for easy targets.  You can still get all of the original figs and rules from the Games Workshop website, and they're readily found on eBay.

A great campaign game from GW.  The actual fighting was done in standard tabletop format, though it was the first miniature game I played that utilized 3 dimensions.  The box set provided a great assortment of carboard structures to support it.  The injury and character advancement tended to rely heavily on luck.  I enjoyed this though as my characters began to have a personality as their stats fleshed out.  Overall, its fun but you need a large group to keep the campaign fresh.

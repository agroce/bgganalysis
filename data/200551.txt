It's a fine enough solo game to pass the time. Wish there were some more choices in the tracks, even if every roll gave a choice of two options. But whenever you rely on randomness...

This is really more of a puzzle and how well you can leave room in the board to deal with some bad dice rolls. While an interesting puzzle, I'm not really interested in games that are only puzzles. I guess that's the downside to writing and debugging software all day. I am finding that I also like a little bit of interaction with another player when I play a boardgame. The price is right to try it out so why not give it a go instead of reading my lame thoughts on the game.

Im surprised by how much I liked this game. I don't usually care for solo games, but I really enjoyed this one. I played it to learn the rules (before I introduced it to my group) and after one play, I found myself wanting to play it more and more. It's a thinky puzzle game with a good amount of decision making. I hope a publisher picks this up and releases it to the masses.

Doodle tracks with a thin railway theme. Once you've plopped down the towns and mine you can project a grid configuration that will connect everything to everything, and then the dice may or may not allow you to do that. In the solo game, rolling a 1 for track is strictly inferior to rolling a 3, 5 or 6, and rolling a 2 is strictly inferior to rolling a 4 or 6. In practice you'll be tossing bad tracks in places that don't matter, but you still can't do without lots of 5s and 6s. In the end you'll either get the all-encompassing network you planned from the outset or everything will break down. The multiplayer game has the basic property of all of its "same features, different boards" relatives: there's little point to comparing scores because aside from the general frequency of split tracks, the fact that you use the same numbers ceases to matter as maps diverge. The advanced version is possibly more fun since it turbocharges the push-your-luck element, increases the criticality of rolling black 6s (and white 5s and 6s for shares), and provides even more possibilities for plans to crash and explode, while causing multiplayer maps to diverge even faster.

Very satisfying, addictive, easy-to-learn, elegant print-and-play game.  I love love love it!

The 2016 release 'Avenue' has some similarities, but I like 30 Rails much better.

The simplest PnP I've come across - the game board is a simple single sheet and the rules so elegantly laid out you're up and running in a minute. Not the greatest or deepest game ever, but really neat. I love PnPs like this.

RATING: 7
FIRST IMPRESSION:

This is a solid design in the vein of Karuba/Take it Easy/etc where everyone has to place a same "tile" or RR track in the same area. One seeks to connect towns and the towns to the mine as much as possible. This is solid filler material.

Requires only two shared dice and one score sheet for each player. It's an ideal print-and-play format.

The rules are outstanding. I was able to wing-it through a basic solitaire game almost section-by-section on a first read-through. I scored terribly, of course, but I learned as I played.

As you might guess from seeing the game sheet, play is like a cross between Wurfel Bingo and Take It Easy. 30 Rails adds two features I really like: seeding the starting board (with mountains) and providing two overrides to the dice rolls.

I can see why people may like the game, but it was not for me. Sure worth a try to see if you like it. It is free and consumes almost no ink.  With solo microgames I think I prefer something with cards or cubes.

[u]10-Sep-2016[/u]:  Wow, what a fun game!  There is something about building paths, tile-laying, creating a landscape, etc. that I just truly enjoy, and this game falls in that category.

It's a dice game, but it's more about using what you're given rather than being stuck with what you've rolled. One die will tell you which row/column you're allowed to build in, and the other die will determine which type of track to place. You want to connect as many of the four stations as you can to gain VPs. There is one "bonus" square and a Mine that will also give you extra points if used.

Overall, a really enjoyable dice/route building game. Another winner from Julian for me that includes Dungeon Construction Kit: Cursed!

Nice little print-to-play railroad game, which is basically a Yahtzee-variant. I like Yahtzee and I like solo games (which this basically is). Nothing too fancy, just print a paper, read the rules and go.

Great game. Simple enough to learn how to play in a few minutes but so complex that you can spend hours trying to get a better score. Also, I love the patterns that the rails form, it has some kind of abstract beauty.

The print and play game everyone should own. Plays good solo and has some thinky elements when it comes to overrides and choosing the "right" spaces. Definitely could see how it could play good with a crowd (dice-chucking like Yahtzee, but with some building decisions).

Initial Review: 7.5

A nice print and play game on a single page that benefits from the dry erase treatment. The mechanics are simple to pick up while you try to mitigate the rolls trying to connect the stations and the mine with each other. The graphics are simple, but I think that it does a favor providing a quaint look. A fine solo filler game!

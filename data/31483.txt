FFG should stick to Ameritrash. It's the world champion of Ameritrash. To ME, this is a dull Euro (and I LIKE Euros!) that doesn't really grab me.

Like most games that don't speak to me, I will always give them many more chances. I won't write off a game until I've played it at least ten times. I gave Dominion a good year before I finally learned to love the game. This might require the same tenacity.

Alright, so it was only one play. Still, nothing new here. Well produced and with a good set of rules - it even seems to have some amount of interesting decisions. It's a common Euro all the way - a touch of complexity, rare interaction, pushing around a cube building engine, in the end, it seems too tight with 4 players (I was shut out of some critical buildings early on). It has no additional place in my collection. Caylus does this (as do other games) with more aplomb. I'll pass.

Lots of interesting mechanisms are blended well in this game. Shades of Puerto Rico (roles); resource translation (Key-games); shipping goods (Cuba) and building buying from Puerto Rico/Cuba mean that you have seen all the parts before but not in this combination. The game is engrossing and the routes to earning victory points seem well balanced after a few games.

Very interesting economic game with a theme that I enjoy so much, navigation, history, economy. A game full of strategy and lots of ways to win. Sure have some luck effects on the contracts, but easy to correct with the free player market that makes the game very open but at the same time puts better contracts on players hands. The downtime with 5 players is big, but I enjoyed playing in this number anyway, the small amount of buildings available force the players to make different strategies.

Another board game about trading in the Mediterranean. Typical eurogame. Players buy buildings that produce cubes, trade cubes in the market and load their cubes on boats in order to fulfill their contracts and earn gold and victory points. There is also a bidding for turn order. Nothing really innovative. There is a lot of luck involved in drawing contract cards especially in the first rounds of the game. The game takes over 2 hours to play. Thats too much for what it offers.

The following is Alan How's quote on Diggers.  Sums it up perfectly for me: 'Constatinopolis has as many sub systems as letters in the game. Choose roles, buy buildings, produce resources, use some of them, buy/sell more at the market, get contracts, buy ships, sail ships, get money, earn VPs, repeat with more options each turn, manage cash flow, enjoy game for about 3 hours. Consider when to play next vs influx of new games. Come up for air.  This was more engrossing than I thought it would be. Not award winning, but it worked well.'

Too many things to look at for my taste.  A lot of different buildings and scoring ways.  Nearly pure resource management with a touch of biddig-role selection.  Randomness for the contracts of the ships can ruin your game.  Nice production, and clear game flow, but not my game.

A well designed development game. This is the definition of a euro game that has nothing new to offer BUT is a very good game that I could play many times. Although it does not raise the bar very high, it does offer solid gameplay with NO mistakes by its designer, so it is a good game to play, with nice production quality by FF. I can't find anything wrong with the game.

Costantinopolis is a classic Euro that should have been released a few years ago (as far as I understand, its release was delayed for a while), because in 2010 it swims in a quite overcrowded sea: it lacks any innovation and fails to bring excitement.
Nevertheless, it is a more than decent gamer's game, with an high standard production (except for players' boards, thins as paper...) and with several ways to make victory points. The only very annoying mechanic is the contracts dealt randomly: when you can't find matches for your production, even a great strategy can sink...

Juego de gestión de recursos donde los jugadores compiten durante nueve turnos por la obtención de la mayor cantidad de puntos de victoria. Algo innovador y poco visto en el panorama lúdico de los eurogames. Como reflexión personal no más decir que, el primer diseñador que aporte un “algo nuevo” al objetivo final de un euro de gestión de recursos que no sean los puntos de victoria, será nombrado Mesías Lúdico. Témome que no caerá esa breva. 

Los jugadores construyen edificios de producción que otorgan bienes básicos a sus propietarios. Con la construcción de otro tipo de edificación podemos manufacturar esa materia prima y convertir esos bienes en dinero y/o puntos. Con otra tipología de edificación se puede conseguir beneficios especiales o/y puntos de victoria. Los bienes producidos pueden ser transportados por ultramar consiguiendo más dinero y más puntos de victoria. 

Juego en el que la gran cantidad de opciones y los combos que cada uno se construye, hace difícil el bloqueo del contrario y la sensación que siempre hay algo que podemos hacer. Como no, continuamente debemos optar por la opción más óptima que contribuya y genere los mayores réditos materiales, económicos o maximice la obtención/producción de puntos de victoria. Se vislumbran sus múltiples y variados caminos hacia la victoria lo que lo hacen rejugable. 

En síntesis el juego está bien en su conjunto, planteamiento y desarrollo, algo poco meritorio ya que uno es el prototipo de eurogamer al que le gustan este tipo de juegos. Por contra no ofrece nada novedoso respecto a la treintena de juegos que poseo en mi ludoteca de estas características. En cualquier caso cada vez que Toni tenga a bien sacarlo a la mesa no pondré reparo alguno, aunque está descartado como futura adquisición.

RATING: 7
Very euro-style for a FFG game.  It's an okay economic game revolving around random contract cards but giving you multiple ways to mitigate luck along the way.  The base economy is two-fold in the sense that you need both cash and cube production, but ultimately I think cube production is the true "currency" of this game.  If you don't continually increase your cube production, it's going to be a rough and painful ride unless you buy the city wall tile that reduces cube purchase costs.  Putting goods on slower boats is a good way to boost your points, and this is a fairly low-scoring game.  Also, avoid the temptation to chew up cubes in the yellow commercial buildings... if you're over run with a particular cube color, it may be a viable way to avoid cube loss, but it's just not as valuable as shipping (especially if you can use a slow boat or fulfill multiple small contacts that get you 2 VP instead of 1 VP and roughly the same money).  Notes to self: need to try again + play faster + invest in more production buildings early.  Avoid the trappings of green and yellow buildings and focus on red (cube production buildings) and buying more ships and trade houses to get money and VP from shipping.

Es un juego de gestión de recursos en el que los jugadores compiten durante unos ocho turnos por obtener mayor cantidad de puntos de victoria. Hay que construir edificios que producen bienes.. otros que pueden convertir esos bienes en dinero y/o puntos, otros que te pueden dar beneficios especiales o puntos de victoria. Los bienes que se producen además si son transportados por barco, pueden producir dinero y más puntos de victoria. Es un juego en el que siempre tienes mucho que hacer y nunca te llega.Continuamente hay que escoger la mejor opción. Multiples caminos a la victoria.  Muy recomendable.
Duración en torno a dos horas. Probado a cinco jugadores y perfecto. Se dice que escala muy bien.

Not as horrible as I thought it would be.

It is only similar to PR in the sense that there is a shipping strategy vs a building strategy. The gameplay and mechanics are quite different. The 2 seem to be balanced as I was 1 point apart from another player using the opposite strategy.

The game however is totally multiplayer solitaire with ZERO interaction. There is some fiddliness. And it's cube pushing. The game introduces nothing new that hasn't been seen many times elsewhere.

La clave de este juego con diferencia, es comprar edificios industriales (rojos) y barcos, de esta forma podrás ir colocando casi sin problemas los contratos que te vayan saliendo, con lo que generaras el dinero suficiente para mantener tus opciones, del resto de edificios hay unos pocos que te pueden dar alguna ventaja, es un juego muy muy largo 45 minutos por jugador.

Pretty disappointing. Puerto Rico without the charm, the balance, or the depth. A cube fiddling game without much to redeem it. A few fairly minor interesting ideas are overwhelmed by a since of imbalance, a major feeling of by-the-numbers design, and a lack of theme.

Just stick to the original Power Grid, Puerto Rico, Goa, or something like that. This has little to offer.

Constantinopolis is an economic game based around resource production and trade.  Players compete to be the most influential (but not necessarily the wealthiest) merchant in Constantinople.

Players acquire fame by shipping resources to distant lands, paying for public buildings, and operating commercial properties within the city.  Resources are produced with industrial buildings the players must also purchase.

The rulebook is intimidatingly thick rulebook, but much of the rules are simply examples.  Despite the large, well-illustrated board, most of the gameplay occurs on the player mats.  The board is simply there as a score marker and to old the large number of tiles.

Direct player interaction is limited to an occasional auction phase (this is a European game, so an auction had to be in there somewhere!) should two players find themselves competing for the same public office.

Indirect player interaction is mostly done through purchasing buildings; there is a limited number of buildings available, so if you are quick you can deny your opponents access to key buildings they need.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fairly straight forward economic engine game.  Cash seems a bit tight though to expand quickly so need to explore more efficient ways to generate income.  First play was with 2 and was left a little underwhelmed.  You obviously lose the tension of the Office auction, but the final score was competitive.

Update after 2nd play: Big rating drop. Being on the receiving end of getting contracts that are a complete mismatch for your goods is just too annoying. I think there's a fix somewhere, but I'm not sure what it is. I think getting contracts before buying buildings would help, but I haven't tried it. But it's an engine game, so if your engine stalls on turn 1, you feel like you're out of it, and have a fairly long game ahead of you just to be a good sport.
-----
Preliminary rating after 1 play. There does seem to be a nice array of strategies. Shipping is very strong, but there is still variation in how you go about it. Once you start parallelizing everything execpt the auction and building phases, it moves along pretty well. Very very very traditional Euro feeling.

RATING: 4
A run-of-the-mill "obtain buildings, collect resources, transform resources into VP and money with which to build other buildings"-style game. It has one small-ish redeeming feature, and then squanders it brutally on luck of the draw. The idea that resources take a bit of time (measured in turns) to yield cash and points is not often seen in games, and might have resulted in a higher appreciation for the entire product were it not for the bloody stupid idea to introduce a next to unmitigated card draw for exactly those conversion assignments. I'm sure that some effort was made to balance matters, but I don't like it when I'm left up in the air like that. I want to play and engage in doing stuff, not sift through a hand of cards and conclude that this turn has gone mostly to waste. Again. 

In this category of games, engine builders, there are many better and more involved games to play, and that leaves Constantinopolis' existence up in the air. It is not a bad game, but neither is it something which comes immediately to mind when you think of the above core mechanic. In a world where many thousands of games vie for attention, I'm afraid that Constantinopolis doesn't stand out sufficiently to warrant more than a few plays.

Produce goods, buy and upgrade buildings, purchase ships and load goods... repeat until victory. The most efficient engine wins.

This is a solid game, though it lacks some of the elegance of Puerto Rico and also lacks the well-integrated theme of, say, Florenza.

This game is a keeper, though, and the artwork and components are certainly above average.

Elegant and undoubtedly polished, Constantinopolis is yet another "bid for a role granting special powers / build tiles granting production cubes, special powers and victory points / ship cubes for money and victory points" as it has already been seen in several games published in the last 5 years. Good execution, but nothing really new.

After playing this game twice, i do not entirely agree with the comparison of this game to Puerto Rico. Although some general mechanisms are familiar the game offers a lot more options building wise to develop strategies.

For example the market,shipping and production mechanism are happening in fixed sequence. As such you are not dependent on own and other players choice of roles. The roles each offer a number of advantages however currently there was not yet an extensive bidding spree on the roles.

Maybe we have to familiarize ourselves more with the roles before the bidding frenzy starts.

Next to that in the 4 player game we played the person early in the lead doing a lot of small time shipping (me) eventually won. However not by a huge margin. The focus on victory points an how to obtain them is something which we will definitely take into account from the beginning of the game in the next game we play.

In short I do not regret buying this game. One additional extra is that the game is entirely language independent except for the rules.

RATING: 7
Starting this out as a 7 after one play as it was enjoyable and I'd usually be willing to play it again.  However, I could see this dropping with more plays.  Could replayability be an issue?   The game feels very linear in how you build up your economic engine.  All the tiles are out there and purchasing order could be max/min'ed and streamlined.  The cards offer ways to change that order.  But you don't have any to begin the game, and it is hard to save them from turn to turn (have to buy the trading posts).   Buildings seem a safer way to earn money and points...especially early as opposed to relying on good card draws.  Thus early on, I'm worried about the game being samey once everyone realizes this.

I did not come into Gen Con expecting much from Constantinopolis, and was pleasantly surprised by my demo of the game at the Fantasy Flight Games booth. It seemed to hit all the right buttons, and by the end of the demo I purchased the game. Unfortunately the game failed to live up to my initial impressions, and I have since passed the game out of my collection.

Constantinopolis, shares a lot of similarities with Puerto Rico. Both are economic snowball games with a similar cycle: build production, produce goods, ship good for points or sell them for money, repeat. Both of them have some fairly interesting little interactions between buildings. The source of the greatest degree of their difference is what the game adds to that cycle. Constantinopolis’s main one is managing the randomness of a draw deck of contracts. Each contract provides you with a combination of shipping capacity, time to deliver and types of good that the ship will receive. Because of this randomness, there is some interesting decisions to be made in the exact composition of goods production buildings you acquire (there are five types), as well as how you go about expanding your card draw capabilities, and what you do with excess good cubes at the end of the round. Most of the individual phases of the game are performed simultaneously, with the only real competition between player being an auction for turn order/special powers and building/ship scarcity. This reduces the total replayability of this game for me, as there were only so many interesting decisions to be found in reacting to randomness with only limited interference from other players. 

So I really don’t think this game has a place in the collection of any but the most die-hard of economic snowball fans. If you love Puerto Rico, Power Grid, and Scepter of Zavandor and want another economic snowball game to explore, then this one might be worthwhile. If not? Don’t bother.

Nice and quick game. Focus is mostly on fullfilling your contracts rather then scoring points through buildings (in comparisson with Puerto Rico or Cuba). This makes the game a bit more limited then either Cuba/Puerto Rico. However you get a game that you can finish in about 1 hour and play multiple times on your gaming evening! Nice addition to my collection!

After one play-through of the English commercial release (GenCon purchase), I'm pretty impressed. Puerto Rico on steroids, with a huge complexity and micromanagement boost. Played it with 5 people, all playing it for the first time. The full game, setup and teardown included, took 2.5 hours, but I can see it speeding up significantly with experienced players.

You get the feeling the game is just a lot of different mechanisms that have been used in other games thrown together under the guise of "multiple paths to victory". But it just doesn't come together as a game. Instead, it all adds to fiddliness, AP and length of game time with no enjoyment payoff at the end.

Impressions so far (1 2-player and 2 5-player):

-Very nice production
-The set up is a little tedious
-The rules are not that complex, but the game itself was deeper that I expected from reading them.
-The game for new players takes much longer than the published time.  Everyone really needs to be planning their turn while the players before them are taking their actions, especially during the building purchase phase.  Because of the complexity of the building and market interactions, there can be some serious AP.
-The gameplay is typical euro, with limited interaction, multiple ways to score VPs, and a nice economic buildup; nothing ground breaking here.  It seems a bit dry and fiddly, especially as the game progresses, but was satisfying nevertheless.

Overall, I give this a 7 preliminary rating and am looking forward to more exploration of this game.

2017-09-12: Incredibly EURO by FFG's standards! Very dry and standard "convert goods to points" gameplay.
But I quite liked it even though I found it incredibly unforgiving if you got the wrong contract-cards in the beginning.
The other players get simple green/blue contracts and I get only passengers? Well. . That is 2,5 hours wasted then. . 
Maybe I'm just nitpicky. . 

Initial rating: 6 (Nothing very special, but not bad either, just a bit harsh on randomness which might make this go down if played more)

RATING: 5
Constantinopolis is a game about building an economic engine and optimising resource usage for maximum points. Sounds generic? Not a coincidence.

As you would expect players start ramping up their engine by building "factories" that produce goods. Those are mainly used for sending them off by ship, to fulfill orders that rake in cash and points.

There is nothing original about Constantinopolis but also little that is obviously wrong with it. The order machanism is a little ill-fitting because it introduces a significant luck factor in a game that is otherwise fairly strategic (and also not overly variable). While there are ways to mitigate the luck a lucky draw will still have the upper hand. It also seems a little odd to me that you're basically tasked with optimising your turn before you actually know what you're supposed to optimise for, ie. before you know what orders will be available this turn.

Considering how strong the competition is in the engine building department Constantinopolis looks like a sure loser.

Standard Euro but a little clunky and long for what it is. The shipping cards make for some wild luck swings, in theory you can choose better roles to mitigate that but it's still pretty wild luck for something with a "standard Euro" overall design. Hard to believe the rule book is 30 pages, for all the mechanics it should be done in 10 pages with pretty graphics and examples with a back page dedicated to further explanation of gray and green tiles.

A very complex eurogame with many, many wrinkles. My main gripe is that the mechanics is not elegant and the rules are too complicated for what the game offers. The lenght of the gameplay reflects the complexity of the rules. There are so many small rules and nuances that it borders on ameritrash. In spite of the good manual (which is not what common in case of this publisher) you don't have the overview of the game until you play it at least once.

On top of that I would expect FFG to publish games looking fantastic and breathtaking and Constantinopolis is just OK which makes the game even more mediocre.

Try it on your own responsibility. Playing it was a work for me - not fun.

I was afraid that this might be just another resource handling game, but all players agreed that this game gave a nicw and different feeling of this kind of games. The turn order special auction gave a new interesting touch, which worked well and my guess is that the auctions will be tougher in the second game. Just be aware that it's very easy to buy too much in the first round...

Fairly basic economic game with simple rules: build buildings (only 4 types), produce goods and ship them overseas to gain Fame Points. You can also buy/sell to the market. Two interesting mechanics make the game unique: you draw cards to see which overseas markets are available each turn; and, there's an election every turn for political positions. Each position gains you a special privilege. The rulebook is HUGE but the rulset is actually fairly simple. This is a straightforward game with a nice feel to it, but there are probably better games out there now that are more engaging with similar mechanics.

This is a nice and interesting (puzzle) game, but it really lacks interaction. The only interaction between players is the bidding part (no huge part) and the building part, since there are only so many buildings of each type, which isn't a huge/important part, too.

While the first games have been fun, it becomes boring fast, as it's always the same and it looks like there are only 2 viable strategys available.

RATING: 5.5
After a couple of plays, it seems like a fun game with multiple ways to win, but the various strategies are not clear.  There is definitely some strategic planning involved to balance the number of goods produced, contracts obtained, and ships to fulfill the contracts.

There is a lot of luck in drawing cards -- if you happen to be able to deliver them, especially early in the game, then that will improve your ability to buy better buildings, but if you have to keep discarding contracts because of a lack of goods and or space, it's a big waste of time.  So perhaps the most valuable role at the beginning is the bonus three contract cards.  It's probably a good idea to save money to bid for that role (and the wall-builder role) in the auction.

Some buildings are clearly great: the green building that allows you to store 5 goods instead of 1 and the one that allows you to buy or sell goods that you already produce; the wall segments that allow you to transform a cube into another colour (that you produce), or buy goods at a -2 discount, or buy ships at a -3 discount, or require people to bid 3 more than you.

It's definitely a strategic point to buy extra ships so that other players can't get them (especially in a 5-player game, when all ships are likely to get bought up and used in the last turn).

The bidding mechanism is awkward -- how do you know when to end the bidding?  I guess each player gets at least one chance to be the "start player" in an auction.

Player boards reminds me of PUERTO RICO, actual game play reminds me of SAINT PETERSBURG, as one needs to develop one's economy before switching to making points.

Yet, ship deliveries are a good way of making much needed cash, and a few points as well.

Game may suffer from a run away leader problem.

Player interaction is limited to the bidding for the different Offices (i.e. turn order) as well as the available Production/Commerce/Special tiles.

Finally got a chance to play this! It's a really big game with a lot going on.  I'd love to keep playing to really gauge its depth.  I really like pick up and deliver and other kinds of contract fulfillment games; this is a very interesting iteration of the genre in the way that it abstracts distance.  Building interaction is fun. The business about what you can do based on which cubes you do/don't produce is a little fiddly.  (1 play)

Smoothly working and totally un-original (earn money and cubes, convert them through contracts and buildings into VPs, blahblah...) and non-engaging heavy economic game.
Very solitaire feel - you focus on your actions (which might be quite complex at some point) with no possibility (or desire) to check out what all others are doing.  There is some interaction (bidding for turn order/actions and the race for buildings/ships), but it doesn't change the overall impression of solitaire play.
The game is very abstract - way too abstract for my taste.  And I'm very tolerant in this respect...

The only mechanics I can applaude is simultaneous performing of actions by players (with the exception of acquiring buildings/ships).  It's not often encountered in games and it speeds up the game considerably..
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game is clearly an old school design where actions are very tight and difficult. You almost felt like you're hamstrung from doing a lot of things given the amount of different paths available in the game to earn money and score points. Points in this game ramp up like crazy in the second half reminiscence of Russian Railroads. 

The only thing I didn't like is the randomness in the contract card draw. Strangely in this game you always develop your production before knowing what kinda contracts you're getting that turn. It felt kinda strange in the first few game rounds like you're just shooting in the dark and trying your luck. Of course late in the game things will even out as your production engine starts diversifying so regardless which contract you draw you'll be able to fulfill them. Decision front loading is also an issue with this game and could potentially put you out early on if you make a mistake.

RATING: 7.5
Pretty stock standard euro, even with the most stereotypical theme of trading in the Mediterranean, but I enjoyed it enough. You can buy buildings in a few different flavors including goods producing buildings, goods consuming buildings, special power buildings, and points buildings. You can also send goods on your ships based on the contracts you get and this gets you pretty comparable money to the goods consuming buildings but it's much better for points. The special power buildings do interesting things, and I really enjoy games where all the turn order spots also come with bonuses so you have to weigh going first against getting a better bonus.

Constantinopolis is a perfectly good economic snowball game.  Points are very tight, which seems like a good thing.

The theme is horrid, however - there's not much effort expended to make any of the elements make thematic sense.  They could have called the cubes "redium," "blackium," "greenium," etc. and not done a whole lot worse.

Replayability looks very limited, with the contracts being the only variable element - meaning the only thing that differs from game to game is access to early cash.  That affects decisionmaking I suppose but not in a particularly interesting way.

Gameplay is solid but a bit lifeless.  The auctions in particular have no tension at all as cash is too tight and the powers not meaningful enough to bid very much on.  I'm not sure what I think of the contract mechanic yet.  I found myself annoyed by the randomness but it might be that I just wasn't making good enough use of the randomness smoothing effects.  Still, swingy card draws seem like they could change the result of a game which doesn't sit well with me.

I'd like to play once or twice more, but at the moment I don't see any reason to ditch Scepter of Zavandor for this title.

You know that movie in which the retired CIA Agent or Assassin or Detective is brought out of retirement for one last assignment when all he wants to do is spend time with his kids? Or the movie about the ugly girl (you know, the one with glasses)who with the help of a good guy friend (who really loves her) breaks her out of her shell so she successfully woos the handsome jock, only to realize it was her friend she loved all along? That's the kind of game Constantinople is. It's Gombrich's principle of art in the age of mechanical reproduction. A postcard of the Mona Lisa resembles the Mona Lisa almost exactly, and yet its soul is so far removed from the original as to be pretty much meaningless.

You know you've succeeded as a game genre when the cliches arise and start pretending to be the real thing. And honestly, those who don't know better probably won't know the difference. "Hey, it's what you like. You buy factories to produce goods and you tweak them with other buildings so that you can ship them for money and points. That's you're kind of thing, right eurogamer? I got your game right here. It's just want you want, right?"

As a fan of eurogames, I feel like I'm being mocked. There's no originality. No soul. Not even character. Just tiles, cubes and cards that do nothing to excite the brain or the heart.

How fitting that FFG would produce one of the worst "Eurogames" ever made. 

This game has to be seen to be believed. It feels like the byproduct of a rudimentary AI - a meaningless cluster of acontextual basics. Is it exceptionally unoriginal? Yes. Is that the main problem with it? Not really. Constantinopolis is lifeless, generic, and tame. 

Mechanically, Constantinopolis is an economic snowballing game (Zavandor et al) in which players quickly exhaust their starting cash investing in a.) the tiered production of five colors of cubes, b.) matching/interchangeable infrastructure that converts those cubes into money, c.) ships that deliver those cubes less reliably but for more money, d.) a handful of buildings with tiny special powers (I've forgotten them already), and e.) pure scoring buildings. 

Strip out all potential from the above description. Stiffle your preconceptions about what might be possible [i]within[/i] such a framework. Instead, be brutally literal; take my three-line summary at face value. Believe that it is not a framework at all, not the initial premise, but the thing itself. Imagine a game that takes no risks, where nothing is broken and yet nothing could be said to "work." Constantinopolis is that game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Buy buildings to generate various goods. Get contracts for those goods. Then ship the goods to fulfill the contracts and get paid in victory points and money. Use the money to buy more buildings. Some buildings can help in other ways such as improving storage. Other buildings can convert goods to money and/or resources. Finally there are buildings that just generate victory points. It offers the satisfaction of economy building with only moderate complexity. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The barest yet example of sewing many different euro mechanics together without creating any tension between players. Entirely too much unmitigated luck in the shipping contract cards for the time the game takes to play (and I don't mind luck in my games), dry as hell & lacking in any sort of interaction.

I'm downranking this as I type. I feel sorry for the designer as this probably would have gotten more plays and a higher rating a couple of years ago when it should have been released. Nowdays it just seems mediochre and I would not purchase it even for £5. Not worth playing.

Constantinopolis feels very derivative. Re-using old mechanisms isn't necessarily a bad thing if a game adds its own twist to them and puts them together in an interesting way. Unfortunately this is not the case here. Constantinopolis feels bland and generic as any originality is missing (with the exception of one tiny mechanism). This is not helped by lack of drama and interaction: the most exciting thing that can happen is that somebody buys a building you kind of thought you'd might want to buy. Wow.

Rulebook is extremely "wordy", games twice as complex as Constantinopolis have been explained with half the pages. This may seem like an odd thing to complain about, but plowing through 30 pages of rules does take (unnecesary) time.

Economic game without enough competition and interaction + it takes 30-45 minutes longer than it should. Sorry, I don't see any reason to play Constantinopolis again. Oh, and the gameboard here is only for the tiles... there isn't any "action" going on in there... :(

Muy buen eurogame. Combina mecánicas conocidas ya en otros juegos y logra un desarrollo de la partida bastante fluido y equilibrado. Recomendable para amantes de los juegos de gestión de recursos, aunque introduce un poco de azar en el reparto de los contratos (cartas). A mi me gusta mucho.

[2011-01-03] Images make it look like the 'deluxe edition' figures come with the basic edition. Not unexpected for an Italian game, but I am surprised that FFG hasn't made clear what is in the box, 'meh' on them then for that. Oyk, terrible names for things - what the heck is an "Ager"? I've never heard of one, and I don't know how to pronounce it. Alimentary? How about simply, "Food"? Way too clever by 3 parts at least.

This game is a game of mechanisms only, there is absolutely no theme at all. The rules are terribly long, and will take forever to get through again in a few months of not playing.

I had fun playing this. I can see that the mechanisms have been well playtested. I was very happy to find that we had absolutely no questions after reading the rules; bloody hell that took too long to do!

[2011-11-18] The random nature of the deliveries works against this game. Love! how everything works, but annoyed that a random draw can hose a player.

Just boring. I don't mind pasted on theme, but this game felt just buying differently coloured buildings and buying/selling/shipping different coloured cubes for points. Only interesting part is the play order auction.

A surprisingly good game you have not heard anyone owning.  I played the other day and this game is good.  You have production building that produce cubes of different colors.  You acquire ships to ship them to satisfy orders.  There is nothing new in the game but is has great FFG production and it was surpringly fun.

I am surprised this game is ranked as low as it is on BGG.

just started playing this one, seems good, better than I though just judging it before I played

a very thick rule book but nothing seemed hard to understand
looks great, components are nice.  game doesn't use a lot of player peices 
feels like a very laid back game compared to other games, which is a good thing
it doesn't feel like the game punishes you for anything and you complete small goals both contribute to a positive feeling

I've been playing this as 2 player so im not 100% sure how the whole loose turn thing goes but the game seems open enough for it to not be that big of a deal.

Really like this game. Will get around to writing a real review one day as I'm not seeing enough on the forums yet. 

Basically an economic game that once again has some goods and ships. But there's enough going on to make it interesting and replayable. There is some luck though (contracts).

Though you can take what you want (and maybe deny someone else), there's not really direct conflict (good for some, bad for others), and as such, no gang up on the leader either (a mechanic which annoys me so glad to see this). 

It's straight forward, easy to teach, and doesn't take long to play.

11/16/10 Played 7/9's of a four-player game. Its OK, but the potential for analysis paralysis from about turn five on is large. We didn't even get a full game in and I felt Constantinopolis begin to wear out its welcome.  The components and graphics were good overall. There appears to be no way to reel in a run away leader, as players have almost zero interaction with each other. In summary Constantinopolis is a fiddly, uninspired Puerto Rico. 
03/08/11 Played 6/9's of a four-player game. Same players, and we got no further than last time. So I don't see the game ever progressing quicker. 
09/24/11 Played a *whole* three-player game. It not only took three hours, it felt like five hours. The downtime issue is a big one. Therefore I'm changing my rating from a "6" to a "5". I hope I don't see this game for at least 18 months.

Own a prototype copy as a basis for writing the German rules. Interesting first 2-player session - I always was second until the walls gave me enough Fame Points in the end to win by 1 point (43 in total). 
Not a good result if you take into account that the fame track has 80 spaces ;)
With four players it became clear that the game is unforgiving if you make one or two bad decisions at the start (and have bad luck in drawing the contract cards). If the other players play well, you will be hopelessly fall back after the first half of the game. This time the winner almost reached the final space on the fame track.
Noone ever used their Sales Departments this time, which was veryirritating. The playing time appeared much too long: 3 hours net. More games (and some rule questions for the designer) will show if something went wrong here ...

- the auction for positions and bonus seems great but ends up fiddly and annoying...

Solid turn-stuff-into-points game, though the rewards seem kind of stingy and there's not a whole lot of innovation.  Then again, this game was "coming soon" about six years before it was actually released, so it's a bit difficult to hold that against it.  Also, I dislike the fact that it's so profitable to launch lots of almost-empty ships.  It's just silly.

RATING: 7
A typical "Euro", with shifting market conditions and goods production/management. Decent, but the theme felt so general that it didn't mean much to me (could have been ANY European city and time period). The game centers a bit too much around getting the contract cards for shipping, I feel. You can totally ignore shipping and get an OK score by just processing your own goods with yellow buildings and donating triples to "the people" when possible, but even if you win this way it feels pretty sterile and almost automated. Some similarities to Puerto Rico with the role selection etc, but I think I'd rather play that!

Pretty standard Euro fare ... buy resource production, buy buildings and deliver contracts to convert resources into money and VP's, and use the money to buy more production and conversion buildings; aiming to switch to a higher ratio of VPs over money towards the end. It's another round-based game, this time 9 of them, with your engine increasing slightly each time, but still feeling same-y. Nonetheless, it's solid, it's done well. There's a couple of different avenues to explore as to how best to get your VP conversions going. If it was the first Euro you'd played, you'd probably be impressed. For the more jaded, it's just another cube-converter with nothing special that screams out purchase of this one over others.

RATING: 8
"Excellent medium-deep euro which is misunderstood and underrated. Most of the randomness can be mitigated, and there are some really clever synergies available. There isn't a lot of interaction, but the auctions for roles can be really important. I love the multiple paths to victory, engine-building, need for optimization (but with uncertainty that you have to mitigate), and minimal conflict."

What I like:
- Low-confict, with only minor auctions and finite building supply
- Economic feel, with production and selling
- Multiple paths to victory (but not point salad)
- Moves fairly quickly, with simultaneous decisions and bookkeeping

What I don't like:
- The all-pay role auctions could get a bit nasty
- There are a few nit-picky rules to remember
- Player boards and market cards are really thin
- Would be better if the cube colors were stronger thematically

I can understand the complaints that this doesn't have enough interaction, but I like that. I understand the complaints that the contract draws are too random, but I view it as a challenge to mitigate and/or respond to what you draw (and the game has plenty of ways to do that). People complain that it is generic/derivative/dry, and I can kind of see the dry concern, but I am not aware of any other games like this, and although the "Constantinopolis" theme is fairly thin, the economic production and shipping/selling theme is reasonably strong.

I would put the weight at 3.0, a bit lower than BGG voters. There is almost no hidden information, and no randomness aside from the contract draws. My first 2p (learning) game took 3.5 hrs, but we have worked it down to a bit over 2 (still including a little AP and socializing).

Constantinopolis is a resource-production/contract-fulfillment game with a ton of moving parts.  You start with a ton of money that evaporates instantly as you invest in some bare-bones production; you probably won't even approach that amount of money again until midgame.  You need to buy production buildings as well as ships to fulfill the contracts, and you need to find ways to get more contract draws, as they are blind and might not match the goods you produced (and you generally can't save goods from turn to turn).  You can also buy or sell goods on the market to help line you up to the contracts, but there are some annoying restrictions on that (which of course you can buy buildings to bypass).  Overall, it feels like a really slow-moving snowball game, and you're likely to find one player running away with it in the end.  But it sure does provide you with a lot to think about.

A very well-designed game, fun to play and even evokes its theme pretty well compared to many other similar games.  The scarcity of buildings and "choice of office" mechanic seems just right - enough uncertainty to mean you can't rely on always being able to execute some favorite strategy, but not so much that you feel locked out from *any* viable strategy.

The only slight mark against it for me is the physical implementation of shipping, where you end up pushing these awkward piles of ship cards, contract cards, and cubes around.  Not a big deal, really, but the only cumbersome bit in an otherwise elegant game design.

I liked this game but my playing partner didn't. There isn't much player interaction but the choices are interesting and the components are very good. It's a typical Euro: buy buildings to produce goods or gain other benefits. Collect contract cards to ship goods for gold and fame points. Loading ships with contracted goods was fiddly. Need to find a better way to complete this task.

If the game sounds interesting to you then you will probably like it. My rating based on one 2 player game.

This is a nice light-medium euro with beautiful art. Easy to teach and learn, especially to gamers who have been exposed to euro style games.  There are several paths to victory which make strategizing fun.

My rating may be to low, there is a lot to like but as a package it doesn't quite work.  Most of the game is non interactive and puzzling out how to best position the resources you earn.  The vp cards seems wrongly priced.  It is a lot of work for not enough work.

This is a solid, economic-engine Euro. I was pleasantly surprised after my first play earlier this year, and have played it much more since.

Because there is some role selection via light bidding, goods production and shipping, purchasing of buildings, etc., I feel like the game is fairly mechanically diverse. There is some randomness in the way different contracts become available to the players, but I think this can be mitigated with various choices in the player powers and buildings in your tableau. I like the snowball feel this gives towards the end of the game when you end up getting a lot of money and points for you progress.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Played a 5-player prototype 1/12/2009 (final version?)

A solidly designed economic engine game, but there are many options that give balanced numbers of points.  It feels like you can do whatever you want and have similar results.  That assures a close race, but makes the game feel bland.

It is basically a solitaire game.  There is some interaction in turn order/role selection, but this is minor compared to most actions in the game.  Early in the game there is a little more luck than I would like when drawing contract cards.  Some lucky players will get to ship goods (and get extra money and points) while others will not because the cards they draw don't match their goods.  Late in the game, this is mostly mitigated as players can draw more goods and have more items to ship.  I would play it again, but it doesn't really bring anything new to the table.

Straight Euro goods management game with Puerto Rico style 'role' selection. Likely best when play sessions aren't too close together. The invariable setup could make the game feel 'same-y', especially at two players, where there is only one building of each type available.

I was invited to join playing this game after everyone had the rules explained to them already.  I took one look at the game and realized that there wasn't one original idea in it.  I was able to play a competent game with only a few infrequent rules clarifications.

At the end I wondered why I had wasted my energy playing this barely stirred cocktail of every other better Euro out there.  Engine building, resource management, set collection.  You know it is the Library because it produces a red cube and a black cube, you know it is the vomitorium because it produces two green cubes, etc.

I should stress that there is not one bad thing about it, but I've had my fill of the Just Another Soulless Euro model.

As I was playing I couldn't help but laugh as I was spouting what should be it's tagline: Never before in this city.

I really love this game.  It has great artwork, and a really fun flow.  However, it loses some points because there is little or no PvP.  I guess in my mind I compare it to Puerto Rico where you need to find your own corner of the market.  Go for trade goods that nobody else is going for.  But in Constantinopolis, it isn't as important to be unique.  Maybe I am just inexperienced with the game (only played it twice), so perhaps it has some untapped potential. Still a great game.

One of those resource-generating-converting-to-VPs engine building type games with a hint of city building theme thrown in for attractiveness (well, it's attractive to me anyway). A little too solo for my tastes but still very enjoyable. Very vaguely reminded me of Glen More.

Same old same old. This game has nothing new despite the time we've been waiting for its release. It has some neat ideas like the... no! Nothing new here! Not one single new idea I guess. Why should I bother playing Constantinopolis over another trade/ship cubes kind of game? It has a good presentation and all but the randomness, specially in the first contracts, can drive a player crazy!

From a read through of the rules this looks like a good game ...if it had come out in 2005/6. The cube churning design of this game has been buried by Le Havre,Masters of Venice and a few others. Its a shame that FF could not get this game out closer to when it was originally designed because, as of September 2010,  this game looks clunky and antediluvian.  The Contract selection/allocation/market place section has the potential for sclerosis with averagely slow players, never mind the AP prone. And the names of the roles is just so irritating - why bother using all this faux Latin nonsense?

It's not really got any original features, i hope to be proved wrong and that the sum of the game is greater than the rules

In a three player game, the situation may arise that one player threatens to build all Wall tiles. Both other players fear to loose to much momentum if they try to outbid him and he will win.

RATING: 7
Better than I expected. Nothing too stellar, but works generally well. Could do with a couple of turns less as it runs a little long. Some random stuff that makes for painful turns.

You would think it purely a cube processing game, and who needs another one of those? But sometimes cube processing can be fun, or at least challenging. The key here is that you are trying to do several things in balance as VPs can be earned in several ways. There is also an underlying "ship or not to ship" decision, plus some interesting timing on your cash flow.

It is not the greatest game ever invented, but I think we all thought it the best of a five game session, which included the obtuse Glen More.

The killer is the very high price, and the fact that it is not that well produced for that price.

Oh, and titling in Latin serves as an effective way of stifling narrative.

so far ,
4 plays 3 + 4 player
3 plays 2 player

There are more strategies than at first meet the eye. 
All require some ship deliveries for the cash and points.
every game we play is close, usually 2 points between 1st & 2nd.

Donations are an eye opener, it is possible to win by focusing all your production purely on donations, and you need only 5 or 6 buildings to achieve this, ( with a handful of ship deliveries thrown in )

Focusing on the wall building, the effects as well as the points accrued at the end make a big difference especially if you get them to yourself, hog position 4 in turn order, most won't fight you for it ( and a few ship deliveries )

Using the yellow commercial buildings: if you can get hold of most of the point generators, that can be 4 points per round.

Shipping focus; contracts are everything, first place in turn order is a must, using the market is vital, as many production buildings as possible , as many ships as possible, get hold of the wall sections that reduce cost of ships and can convert a block into another you produce early in the game, get the luxury production building/s.

Balanced combination of strategies, walls become useful more for abilities than points, Yellow commercial buildings = cash generators , ( points are a bonus ), Shipping becomes more important both for points and cash.

playing 2 player really focuses your strategy, eg. can be all walls and  commercial buildings Vs donations. Can be all shipping Vs all public buildings for quick end to game.

Every time we play there are more subtle tactics that appear, Can really recommend this game , but you will have to move out of your comfort zone and try different approaches to really enjoy it, it is very easy to stick with one strategy that you feel happy with, then it becomes repetitive and dull.

Think to Puerto Rico, make it twice as bigger, and then try to balance such a deep and brain-burning game, and you'll end up with Constantinoples.
It's a massive and very intresting project, the Italian way to PR/Caylus/Goa style games.

This is an odd choice for Fantasy Flight - a pure Euro right down to the hackneyed merchants in the Middle Ages turning cubes/goods into fame/points theme. Everything works here, but the game has nothing that's innovative, lasts too long and has a number of fiddly rules and mechanics. Among the more annoying aspects of the game are an unnecessarily complex and non-intuitive auction for player order, two separate market phases that require you to keep track of what you bought and sold on your first visit so that you do not exceed certain limits and fiddly rules about buying and trading in goods based on whether you can produce the good, not on whether you have it. The game also is a real grind for several rounds until you get your economic engine spinning, with money feeling overly tight and actions thus very constrained for more than half the game. In the end, this is a very pedestrian cube-pushing game (not a bad thing in and of itself) that is a bit too long and feels like it could have used a little more fine tuning. It won't be hugely popular, but I hope that doesn't keep Fantasy Flight from pursuing better games in this genre in the future.

We love this game 2-player. The role auction suffers with fewer players but the buildings become even more competitive. I think this game is under appreciated. It's not groundbreaking but it puts a lot of different elements together in a very enjoyable way.

Playing a bit like Glen More (tiles providing cubes of different color, to use when activating other tiles) meets Age of Discovery (load your ships and sail them for differing numbers of turns).  Quite a good engine building game, if not a little dry our first playthrough.  The many steps began to feel natural near the end of the game.  Am looking forward to trying it again.

Only played part of a game to learn it so I admittedly didn't get the full experience, but the randomness of the card draw is a huge negative. You spend your turn building up and collecting goods, then a card draw determines if you actually get to use any of the things you worked on for your whole turn.

Except for that flaw, it seemed like a fairly standard euro. Buy buildings that give bonuses and goods, activate buildings to get your bonuses and goods, then spend those to get points.

Sold.

First Impression:

A trading eurogame taking place in the city of cities.

Although the theme doesn't carry through as much as it could (the resources only differ in prices f.e.), I still love it. The game has constant management and little downtime, as you're trying to manage your various trading assets (ships, production, market, resources, contracts, consumption etc) as efficiently as possible from round to round. 

In theory the game should suffer from a runaway leader problem, but I've yet to see that in practice. The contracts are also a bit of a gamble, but half the game revolves around mitigating that (trade depots, city consumption buildings, public offices, market etc) so this is also a minor issue that has an effect only in the early rounds. Finally, the game does have quite a bit of constant accounting, and though this is not an issue for me for this level, I understend why several players wouldn't like it for this reason.

All in all I like this game. It both draws me to play it, and I like playing it, which is rare.

Don't let the rulebook intimidate, this game has pretty straightforward and user-friendly mechanisms. Individual player boards provide space for the buildings and ships that are used to generate money and victory points in various ways for 9 turns. Simple bidding mechanic allows players to jockey for both turn order and extra benefit for the turn. The mechanisms here are put together well for a very nice VP engine building game.

In the 6th century A.D., ruled by Emperor Iustinianus (commonly called 'Justinian'), Constantinopolis was the largest emporium in the East Roman 'Byzantine' Empire. Built on the shore of the Marmara sea, at the entrance of the Bosporus (Hellispontus), its position led it take on the role of one of the most important harbors. Its quickly expanding trade and exports to close cities were great opportunities for the local businessmen to expand their riches.

Take on the role of an ambitious merchant during this golden era of trade. The task set before you is to become the most successful entrepreneur in the city of Constantinopolis. Compete against your rivals and earn the most renown by completing contracts and establishing viable trade; your fame will be measured by your ability to expand your trade district while managing your delivery contracts.

"Pick-up and Deliver, Commodity Speculation, Auction/Bidding, Simultaneous Action Selection" sounds like a list of my favorite game mechanisms- definitely interested!

Wie voor het eerst het bord ziet wordt helemaal gek van alle symbolen die er op staan, maar als éénmaal alles duidelijk is, dan speelt dit spel toch redelijk vlot weg. Heeft een aantal erg leuke punten, maar ook een paar zwakke punten. Zo leek het mij dat er wel verschillende wegen naar de overwinning zijn, maar als iemand anders dezelfde weg wil bewandelen is het niet mogelijk voor beide om te winnen.

Misschien dat dit beeld nog bijgesteld wordt als ik het vaker kan spelen.

This game is underrated. It's just so hard to be excited about the game. The mechanics are really solid. The interactions are compelling. As far as euros go, it's got an *ok* theme.

It's got a large-ish learning curve. Someone who has already played it will do immensely better than someone who hasn't. This is OK in a vacuum, but for a 2+ hour game with first timers it's a bit rough. Evenly matched players will have a really interesting back and forth. But a new player won't know which tiles to buy and that will set them back for the extent of the game.

It's a game *I* always want to play, but it's not a game everyone else wants to play. If I can figure out a better way to spin and teach the game it would hit the table more often.

The problem with this game is that it is too heavy and has too many rules and special cases to be a family game but it lacks subletly and elegance to be a gamer classic. It is a slightly opaque/obtuse engine building game.

I enjoy engine building games and I enjoy this one. The first play is not great but once you get the pieces down it is fun. It feels like a heavier Kingsburg to me.

RATING: 7.5
Due to nearly perfect, and very thorough iconography, and polished design that permits some simultaneous play, this game is fairly intuitive.  Combine that with its nice decisions and pleasant engine building, and you have a very solid combo.  The biggest downside is that due to the number of contract cards, it's possible to have consistently poor overlap of your production and contract demands.  There are things that mitigate that, but if one person gets stellar matches all game, and another gets poor matches all game, guess who's going to win.  Still, there is a lot of fun to be had in this game.

Cube pusher with a lot going on.  After four plays, I'm still certain that the "supply the citizens" strategy cannot keep up with the "draw a ton of contracts and fulfill them" strategy, so in that regard it can degenerate into the luck of the contract draw.

This game is the diamond in the rough of the board gaming world in my opinion. I have yet to meet a board gamer who has played it (before I sat them down and opened their mind of course :D). Despite its lack of publicity and popularity I find this to be a really good economic snowball game. I like to describe it as similar to Puerto Rico but better. I have played this many times with all player numbers and have enjoyed it immensely every single time. The only reason it is not a 10 for me is that I believe a true 10 must be very deep. This game is not light by any means but it lacks the depth that really gets those unused parts of your brain thinking.

Not a bad game.  Some really neat uses for cards.  Almost seemed like a more complicated version of [b]Uptown[/b].  Well, perhaps that is not the best comparison.  Some good spatial-relationship elements to this too.

2010. 2-4p. 60 min. C.Conrad. Abstract, tile placement, majorities game with Tetris-shaped tiles and a 2-step card-driven tile placement mechanic.

Others say: similar but inferior to Arkadia. Very abstract, theme really feels pasted on. Little control, luck-heavy. Hope to draw the cards that you need.

A nice Euro about area control where you build walls out of Tetris pieces.  Wouldn't mind playing again, but I won't be picking it up.

RATING: 6
A straight forward tactical game. Land grab is the name of the game. Some random luck factor though it doesn't seem to be overwhelming.

Decent but not overly engaging either.

Ick, what a nightmarish graphical design. You get a huge board to play with, yet the actual playing area is so crowded that you cannot easily pry out discs and tiles without upsetting the position of others. I was interested in this game because of the core idea of area control, which always sits well with me; but owing to a bad explanation I was not aware of the option which allowed me to sacrifice both my actions to play where I wanted. This would have severely improved the game to the point where it might have been at least playable; but after it came out it was quickly forgotten by the publisher, to be replaced with the next fast food gaming hamburger, no doubt. (White Goblin Games is all about publishing as fast as the printers and developers can deliver; and not about releasing quality titles which take a long time to reach maturity.)

As a result, I am patiently awaiting the opportunity to try Khan anew. I'm not going to purchase it because of the bad design, so that probably means I'll wait for a considerably long time.

Well executed game, the theme just makes it - otherwise could be a very abstract game.  Otherwise it sits nicely - reminds me of Oregon in the way you search the board for opportunities. Good use of the Pentomino shapes.

RATING: 5
Despite the mongolian theme it is an abstract game where you try to put Blokus-Tiles on the board to give you victory points. To a certain point you can control this but to 50% not as there a hazardous elements. The rules are clear, it plays well however I was not entertained. It lacked of innovation and that replay factor.

Nice game. Not the prettiest there is (and actually graphics are bit confucing and unclear), but the actual gameplay works and there are all the elements which I like: screw your opponents (=blocking), hand management (=hidden information) and luck factor (=every turn there will be some "movement" on the board). Yeah, I definitely liked this!

*Strongly* reminds me of Arkadia, but isn't as good. Trying to pick up the yurts before putting down a conquer tile in their place is the definition of fiddly. The artwork is "meh". Khan thy name should have been Generic Euro Game. The only real fun was having the winner do a Shatner and yell Khan!!! at game end.

This is a sly, but thoughtful game.
It's a euro wrapped in an abstract, wrapped in a euro.
Place your pieces on the board and cover your pieces, neutral pieces and opponents' pieces with scoring tiles of odd and sundry shapes.
Very nice. Plays in an hour with 4 if they already know how to play.

Tetris like as one is attempting to gain areas in particular shapes for points.  Chase out enemy (who leave behind empty camps?) and place your own camps to claim an area, but others might be able to use the enemy (neutral) camps as well.

The Chinese title of this game is totally wrong! "Khan"
should be translated into "可汗" instead of "汗可". I think the publisher or the author of the game should be more careful about using Chinese.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
In production terms, this game looks ugly and has the annoying use of Chinese characters rather than Mongol script, or just english (or even just the correct Chinese characters), but I am absolutely a sucker for anything with a Mongolian theme, so I would consider this. Euro game designers: when you are looking for a theme to fit your abstract game play, please take a little bit longer to get the details right; this is an example where the end result can be jarring, and detract from the game for some.

It reminds me a bit of Arkadia because of the worker placement surrounding buildings. It doesn't have much in common I know but still reminds of that. I'm not fond of this game in particular. I don't like the components. They are clumsy and not intuitive to follow - the artwork is not easy to get. The theme is zero. The cooperative play or the aggressive play seem to be the only real options in this game and I don't like either.

I may play it occasionally though.

Area control and card management game with a Mongol theme. You play the role of a Mongol general who is attempting to drive different rulers out of the lands you wish to conquer. In order to do this you need to place yurts on different types of terrain and this is done by playing cards that correspond with that particular type of terrain. Once you have placed your yurts you are looking to conquer the areas by placing pieces of a wide variety of differently shaped playing pieces that cover your yurts. This becomes increasingly difficult throughout the game as there is less space available on the board and you are left with more irregularly shaped pieces. Victory points are awarded for each playing piece you control and there is an incentive to try and link all your conquered areas as this leads to additional points. This is turn means that despite there being no direct conflict to the gameplay, there are excellent opportunities to block your opponents' strategies. It may all be a bit Euro by numbers and the theme does feel a bit tagged on but this game does require a great deal of thought and forward planning in order to be played well, which raises it above a number of other existing games in this genre.

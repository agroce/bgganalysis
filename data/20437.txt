RATING: 9
Very fun! It is Acquire with a casino theme and gambling.

There is so much to do on your turn but you are always limited by the amount of money you have.

The game does have a bit of luck but a good strategy will still win the majority of the time. It is similar to Poker in that sense.

If you play with hardcore gamers who are all about optimizing for the best strategy, this may not be the best game as a bad card can really mess you up.

In a couple of games we played there was a runaway leader, but it not not so bad. There is also always the gambling aspects if you are hopelessly behind.

Highly recommended.

Area-control games are some of my absolute favorites of all time (see: [thing=42][/thing], [thing=30645][/thing], and [thing=142239][/thing], for a few quick examples). So I was excited to try Lords of Vegas, and it's lived up to all the hype I put upon it. 

First off, this is just a good area-control game, period. Sure, your areas happen to be casinos, and there's other things you can do in the game, but at its core this is a fairly simple game. Earn points from controlling different areas, earn more points for bigger and bigger areas. 

But Lords of Vegas (similarly to [thing=96913][/thing]) layers just enough on top of that simple foundation that the result is a unique blend of mechanics, a delicious push-pull between players, and a really great game. 

Here's the magic: this game has just as much swing from last to first as an actual Vegas table. That's table stakes -- if you're not willing to lose your entire empire because everyone ganged up on you, well, that's Vegas, baby. That's not to say that the game rewards bad play -- it's just a tight rope between doing well, and doing so well that your opponents come to the back alley to beat your brains in. 

I especially love the dice, which denote control of casinos. Each square you control gives you one die, and you can reroll all the dice in the casino to see if a new boss would be elected. High die roll gets to lead the casino. When one casino can net you 7 points, this is a [i]big[/i] deal. And I, with one die, could outroll your six dice -- that's Vegas, baby! 

But it's sweet, and tense, and everyone shouts a lot and has an awful lot of fun. Unlike the more calculated tussles of Tammany or T&E, Lords of Vegas shares more kinship with [thing=93][/thing]: dramatic swings could determine the game state, right up to a photo-finish. If you are into area-control at all, definitely give Lords of Vegas a try: this is a deep belly laugh of a game.

Where has this game been hiding all my life? I played it twice and bought a set of poker chips to replace the paper money. No regrets on that purchase.

Update: 1 year later and this game has 10+ plays. The game holds up magnificently. My game buddies still request to play this game. It may be my most favorite game.  

Update: This game still gets a lot of requests. It has become my groups Monopoly but in a good sense. "What do you want to play?" "I don't know, Lords of Vegas?" "Ok, can't go wrong with that"

LIKE: Lots of tension seeing some good, clever moves. I loved rolling the dice to a big casino to see how the power shifted.
DISLIKE: Random game is random. For a random game, a losing player will feel the game drags. A player could lose big on cards draws or dice rolling.

OVERALL: Our first play was very rusty, but we could see various clever moves. We didn't use the trade action and rarely the gambling action. Overall the randomness holds this back.

Not being a fan of [b]Acquire[/b], I was not thrilled to play this after seeing the comparisons.  But the game was not too similar.  I'm not a negotiation fan, and it seems less a part of this game.  And it has dice to keep the math down.  It seemed a little long and may have a runaway leader problem.  Otherwise, I liked it and I may pick it up.

+ Good, straight-forward economic game; Pretty easy to teach with just enough luck to keep things interesting.
- Hate it when you've pushed yourself to the highest chance of success, but the dice still screw you over.


Why it's previously-owned:
I'm always on the lookout for games that my extended family in Michigan might enjoy.  I took this one with me over Christmas break to teach to them and it was a huge hit!
This now has its residence in Michigan.

Too long for a game that is this random.  The game comes down to a few rolls over control of the big casinos at the end.  With good strategic play you can make it so that these rolls might have like a 3/7 chance of favoring you instead of one of the other players.  Would be better if it took 20-30 minutes, and/or if the draw of what locations you get to control was not completely random.

RATING: 8
Pros
- Vegas theme of gambling and expanding shines through
- Rolling dice hoping to get lucky
- Negotiation on getting different lots
- Rolling for control of a casino is stressful and fun
- Cool board of the Vegas strip
- Gambling in a friend's casino and having them have to pay you out of their own pocket
- Expanding your casino without owning a Lot, hoping it doesn't get stolen from you in the future

Cons
- Runs just a tad long, but it DOESN'T drag
- You have to hand out money each players turn, but if everybody does it, it's not a big deal. Just a little upkeep.

The Vegas strip, divided into lots.  Each turn you draw a lot and claim ownership.  Then you can pay to develop it into a casino.  Lots facing the strip cost more to develop, but will pay out much more. You choose your casino's colour and if it is the same colour as neighbour(s), they join to form a larger casino.  The randomness of this is mitigated by trading in the style of Chinatown.  

The decision making in Lords of Vegas all seems fairly obvious.  Build as much as you can, swallow smaller casinos when you can, trade when you can.  Clever bargaining may save you a few dollars here and there, but that's dwarfed by the scale of the dividends paid by casinos.  And then there is a large chunk of randomness, in the order that payouts turn up, in your ability to gamble with an opponent, and particularly when it comes to re-rolling the dice that determine ownership and payouts from casinos. Overall, Lords of Vegas is like  junk food; some fun while you play it but ultimately not very satisfying.

The rules, artwork and production quality are all pretty good.

Given everything I had read about this game, I was a bit disappointed by it.  It seemed to take us a while to catch on to how the game works, and it didn't seem to have the fun factor that is so commonly associated with it.  I wonder if this might be a reflection of our still learning the game's nuances.  Regardless, there is a bit more luck involved than I prefer to have in a game.

A solid game that I never knew my collection needed. Very high luck factor coupled with the vivid artwork and the dice makes players feel the theme of the game.

I need to play more to give a better rating, but I enjoyed playing it so far.

You try to build hotels and if the same color as a neighboring hotel they merge and the one with the highest die owns the merged hotel. Anyone can pay to re-roll all dice in a hotel and thus become the owner. It's a very luck dependent game but also has some strategy behind it so that it fills the niche of a dice fest where you can get lucky (even for the win) but if you make the right moves you are still rewarded so your decisions are still valid. It has good theme and a high fun factor.

Good game.  I like the strategy of building up your casinos.  There's a lot of randomness in where you can build, but there are plenty of ways to mitigate the luck.  Thematically, it all works.  My biggest complaint is the paper money - seems like poker chips (or at the very least cardboard chits) would have been more appropriate.

Fair warning this game boils down to a TON of luck. Almost every decision you make has some level of push-your-luck element to it, but it is fantastic. This game felt like all of the best parts of gambling, the highs and lows. There is certainly a strategic element to it though, when to build, when to hold, but there's always that temptation to push it just a little further.

First play of this was a lot of fun.  This game really captures the spirit of Vegas where every move is some sort of gamble.  There are a lot of great elements to this game.  Its chaotic, and big swings seem likely, but a huge triumph one turn is just as likely to swing to trajedy the next.  Worth a look to be sure.

Update:
Interesting, Fun, feels like a Vegas game should feel like.  It's easy to underestimate how important trading can be in the first few games, but if you are falling behind it's the best way to stay in the game.  

Update Agin:
Made my top ten of all time list.  All the positives far outweigh the negatives.  The one creeping bit of doubt is that there are times when the game lasts too long -- where the board is basically set, there's no more to buy, no room to grow, and no trades to be made, but everyone is still waiting for the final card to come out and end the game.  Consider cheating that end card a little more towards the top end of the deck.  :)

Fed up trading wood and stone in the Mediterranean? Then this is the game for you!

Although there is a heavy dose of luck because it's 'Vegas baby' nobody seemed to mind and the good and bad luck seems to even out.

That said, even after just one play there seems to be a heavy dose of strategy also attached to this game.

Edit: after 10+ plays...the luck is managed and tons of strategy!

So much fun, great components, great theme and has that nostalgia feeling of a family game from the 70’s/80's with modern day design aspects. It's Monopoly without the boredom!

Explosive fun in a box, plays in an hourish such a great game!

This game has made me realize what I enjoy in games:  Tactics.  People complain about it having too much luck and they can't plan ahead and strategize.  That's true - because it's not a strategy game, it's a tactics game.  You do have to plan, but your success will depend on how well you can think and act on the fly when luck is against you.  Compare to a strictly roll-and-move game that's TRULY random - LoV is NOT like that.  Skillful play can and will mitigate the random aspects.

Everything was against me : I was 4th player, got 9M$ startmoney and after the first turn everybody started to earn money. I didn't : couldn't start a casino, so had to gamble and lost. Another player was very lucky and could manipulate the game (as it should be played), but I had never the chance. So if you would like to gamble play "Gambler" from FX Schmid and then you'll have fun.

Rated 8 after one play with two. Wow! I was curious to play this game, I read the rules... but holy smokes this game is more than what the rules suggest. Lords of Vegas is a bit like Chinatown, with a bit of Acquire takeovers of other's casinos. And sure there's luck with the dice rolling, but luck is something you can mitigate with choices that consider the odds. 

...and the game was just flat-out fun. I know, "fun" is a term that some people scoff at because it's so nebulous, but this game just struck all the right chords. It was fun! We laughed at our fortunes and misfortunes! I'm incredibly eager to try this again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Monopoly for gamblers.  Lords of Vegas skips the roll and move, opting for a more elegant card draw to determine property ownership.  The color-coded casinos add just the right amount of random "Jackpot!" moments.  The gambling mini-game favors the casino, but not so much that the player rolling the dice is hopeless.  The segregation between money and victory points -- your influence in casinos -- is well thought out.

A fun, light social game.

Components (1.5/2.0) Good components except the money included in the game.  Replaced the money with poker chips to add to the theme.

Gameplay (2.0/2.0)  Easy to learn, tough to master.  Takes a play or two to fully get it but players will figure it out.

Theme (1.0/1.0)  Vegas meets monopoly and destroys it completely.  

Replayability (1.0/1.0) Cannot get enough of the game.  Will not refuse the opportunity to play.

Enjoyment (4.0/4.0)  I love this game.  You can play it very aggressively, make shrewd deals, and you are never truly out of the game.  My group also has truly enjoyed this one and it sees a lot of playtime.  Fantastic game, highly recommended!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Fun!  Lots of luck and randomness, but still tons of fun despite (or because of) this feature.  The theme is perfect for this game because everything you do in the game is a gamble.  Do you build a certain color of casino hoping to merge it in with a larger casino?  Do you sprawl out taking the chance that someone else will draw that area and take it over?  Do you reorganize, betting on a roll of the dice to give you control of a casino?  Of course, there's always the 'gamble' option, which is just dice-rolling fun at it's most basic.  

My rating is based on one play, but that one play contained all of us shouting and jumping with excitement during each die roll and waiting with baited breath for the next card to be revealed.  And the negotiation factor just puts it over the top.  Lots of fun.

At first glance there seems to be a boatload of luck in this game; you gain random plots of land, you can gamble with other players (of course) and payouts for casinos are determined by a random deck of cards. Kind of like slots, then (hah). However, after playing a couple of games you'll find a decent amount of depth amongst the chaos (hint - sprawling to connect isolated casinos is key). Plus, it has a great theme that really sucks you in.

I'm starting to think that I love games that have wild swings of give and take.

This is one of those rare euros with a theme that just comes through.  The luck and gambling elements can place you at the top of the heap one moment, then crashing down the next.  its hard to get upset at the system, however, because you know you can (and likely will) recover.  The scoring mechanic is amazing and keeps the score relatively tight for a game with this much luck... but its all calculated risks in the end.

Very Chaotic between the dice and the way the card deck is created. If you are not into randomness then in the words of the Lord Humongous, "Just walk away"!

Overall though this is a lot of fun, but sometimes it plays just a tad too long.

Played "giant" version @ U-Con 2010.  Alex gave an excellent runthrough of the rules.  We played a 2-player game, which seemed to be lacking in terms of drama/action.  An ok game, but not really for 2 players.

Similar to acquire. While I prefer the theme of this one (which is well integrated into the game), there is a bit too much randomness for my liking. It also played quite long (mainly due to the time consuming payouts at the start of each turn) for what it is. Nevertheless, it has some quite fun aspects to it (such as betting in others casinos), so would play again.

I am not a gambler.  I do not understand the pleasure gambling provides to some people.  This game is all about gambling.  Therefore, it is not surprising that I did not like it in the least.

Sure, some may argue that probabilities may be estimated.  Still, that's just a probability and it's just an estimate.  One can make choices based on a likely outcome and yet have that outcome fail to occur time after time after time, ad nauseum.  Even if one manages a successful reorganization, I fail to see the thrill in having managed a better dice roll.  It's a randomized mechanic that depends in no way upon skill.  

I see from comments here that there is a trading rule.  We didn't know of this until the game was almost over.  This might improve the game, but I'm not inclined to play it again to find out.

The part of this game that tries to be a Euro, fails miserable under the weighty impact of swingy luck - in both the card draws and dice rolls.  That's two luck-based elements too many!  Super Meh.  First play with 4 players was terrible.  New casino cards at the start of each round never matched the color of my casinos, so I only ever got base income of $1 per casino.  I had no significant money for several turns in a row and was unable build, sprawl, remodel or reorganize.  After receiving the base $1 per tile income for 3 turns in a row, I had some money, but still not enough to do anything with except gamble.  So I tried to gamble my some money to get more money, in order to have enough money to do anything at all, but I lost and then had no money again and had to start over the slow process of only being able to get not much money each turn.  That sucked!  Which is why this game sucks.  Some lucky players will be having meaningful turns while others will just be watching those lucky players take their meaningful turns.  I got to watch 3 other players do all of the actions of the game while I just waited to get money to be able to do something without ever really being able to ever do anything.

We are really enjoying this game right now. The game can be a bit long (2 hours with 4 players), but with the right group, can be a ton of fun.  

There are a lot of player choices on turns in addition to trading which makes this a very interactive game.  At the core of this game are the dice.  If you don't like seeing a beautiful strategic play undermined by a dice roll that doesn't go your way, stay away from this game.   However, I found LoV to be a perfect blend of interaction, strategy, and the chaos that comes from rolling dice.  This game will see a lot of plays.

Also, I highly recommend that you ditch the paper money and invest in some poker chips.  There is a lot of money changing hands each turn, and the paper money really slows things down.  Besides that, the poker chips fit the theme perfectly.

This is a game that does give the feel of Vegas, as every decision is a bit of a gamble.  Will the casino chain with the fewest cards really be most likely to come up next?  Or will a chain that seems tapped out come up repeatedly?

Player decisions are made to continually build the advantage of a big payout, both in cash and points. It can get very nasty, so don't take it personally.  My only complaint is that a player that draws two lousy lots at the beginning could easily fall behind and not be able to catch up.

But the components are all great, except for that cheap paper money. Do yourself a favor and play with real poker chips.

NOTE - the 2-player version of this game just doesn't work all that well - the inequity between the players is hard to overcome and there's little impetus for trading.  But as a 4-player game it's really a lot of fun.  The luck factor here is strong, so not a good choice for someone averse to that in a game.

UPDATE: I actually do think this works 2-player, but trading just isn't going to happen, so you are missing something.  Also the game can run a bit long.  So I've downgraded my rating slightly.  Still a good game that I'm willing to play when asked.

At first blush, I thought, "this seems like Chinatown, but worse".

Halfway through my first game, I thought, "this seems like Chinatown, but better". It's also even more heavily luck-dependent, but it kind of wears that on its sleeve. (It's also thematic, and probably helps mitigate the Chinatown "well, I guess we know who's winning in half an hour" problem.)

I especially like the scoretrack, and how its requirements  change what players need to be doing as the game progresses.

This game desperately wants to be played with poker chips for money - both thematically, and because you're constantly distributing minor payouts, which is annoyingly slow when using paper currency.

Components: Very busy-looking board. It is confusing to have the player dice be similar in color to some of the casino tiles. It's confusing when a card is flipped up, and suddenly everyone is counting up tiles of that color, but only for their colored dice, and for money regardless but also for points if they control the casino, and for tokens on lots for the active player. It's just too much flurry for my tastes.

Experience: Chaos. Total chaos. People can steal my money, take over my casino, dethrone me from boss, and make me re-roll all of my dice. There's just no stability, no ability to plan ahead. There are a lot of similarities here to Acquire, but I'd prefer Acquire any day. Yuck.

It's basically a faster Monopoly with more dice rolling and randomness or a Catan without the trading and the different things to build.

Area control with dice!  Build up the Las Vegas strip in this great game.  While there are buckets of dice, there is plenty of strategy here.  What is does best, though, is create the Vegas atmosphere.  I've yet to play a game where there wasn't huge swings, creating plenty of "OH YEAH!" moments (and their corresponding "NO!").  So much fun... do yourself a favor and get this one!

It's technically all luck with dice rolls, but it feels like I'm tempting fate. Not a ten because it feels like the last few turns are simply whoever can get the big re-org to win out the big points.

As fitting a game about Las Vegas, there's lots of gambling here.  Incredibly swingy, especially toward the end.  If you enjoy the thrill of the dice rolls, you'll probably like this game.  After I played it (only once so far, granted), I walked away feeling similarly to how I felt after having played Killer Bunnies.  Still, as long as you're just there for the ride, this one is quite the roller coaster.

Received Christmas 2010.

Dec. 29, 2010: Played my first game last night--a 3-player. I like it a lot; it was really, really fun--even though I came in last place. There is quite a bit of a luck element in this, but there are also enough opportunities for some strategies and planning. It also somewhat "feels" like Acquire--one of my favorite games--but plays completely different and is, of course, more luck-based. Altogether, it was just a really fun game. I'm definitely glad I got this for Christmas! Initial rating is an 8.

Modern Monopoly for all of the right reasons. I wish this and Catan had their popularity mirrored, because this game is actually good. Rolling dice to attempt to take over casino blocks is tense and exciting, being able to freely negotiate is great as well. Gambling against another player seems to be a crapshoot, just like in real gambling!

I don't recommend playing this 2P, there's not enough competition to make it interesting.

 Players earn money every turn (real money, everything is in millions in this game). Players can buy into other casinos to share income. They can trade. They can remodel the casinos to improve their score. They can take try and over other players' casinos. They can even gamble in other players casinos.

This is probably the closest thing to a direct Monopoly alternative I've played in recent year- a much better game that plays in a fraction of the time, with no player elimination, none of the tedium. It's a blast. There is luck involved but it fits really well with the theme.

Let it ride!

Just like the real Vegas, the outcome of this game is going to depend on how lucky you happen to be while playing, but that doesn't mean there's no room for strategy or decision making.  

It works best as an end to a game night.

RATING: 8
So, in your group, there's one person who likes the negotiation in Chinatown, and another person who likes the business growth of Acquire, and a third person who likes the push your luck elements of something like Can't Stop.  This is the game for you.  It isn't exactly better than any of these other games, but it does mix the various elements of those games together very well and it carries a theme that makes all the mechanisms make sense together.

Yes, sometimes there's a bit of runaway luck, but this is Vegas after all! I have yet to play a game where players aren't standing around the board at the end of the game, screaming as a fist-full of dice are rolled, hoping that their numbers come up.

EDIT: Adjusting the rating down one point. The luck can really swing against you in this game, in which case it is not much fun. However, I still want to play it, even with that as a factor.

Straightforward gameplay, probably best with 4 for the interaction. Lots of luck with card draw and gambling action. The scoring requirement aspect is neat.

Ultimately this game is rather boring since I'm not big into trading and without making deals, this game comes down to a random card flop or pushing your luck by gambling at others' casinos until you have enough money to reroll dice or buy property.

My cardinal rule has always been that games determined by luck should be quick and light. I hate wasting time grinding out decisions that will be decided by a roll of the dice.

This game completely breaks that rule and I love it. I think it works because the luck is so deeply baked in. They didn't add dice to the game out of a lack of creativity or game design chops - it's the mother of all dice games by design. 

If you aren't feeling lucky, don't go to Vegas!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fun, but difficult to get a handle on a good strategy. Even so, it seems to be very luck dependant, so that a good strategy can be defeated by bad luck on the card draw, whilst a poorly played game can suddenly turn around by lucky card draws.  Still, a fun game.  I only played a 3-player game, but it would probably play differently (better) with 4 or 5. Definitely worth a try.

[$30] On the surface, it looks like luck dominates the game play. Not so. Luck is a part of reality. The person who manages it and reorganizes his casinos in an attempt to be the boss has more fun with the game and has a better chance at winning.

I thought I'd be rolling a lot more dice than I did but still enjoyed it. Not usually a big fan of free trade games, but here it worked. I guess it could go totally crazy if everyone trades around everything all the time.

It did feel like a rich gets richer game but perhaps that was a fluke? Will gladly try again.

Tried again and it was a total disaster. Rating DOWN.

RATING: 7
Lords of Vegas is an interesting game that reminds me a lot of Chinatown but with a bit more player interaction since in addition to haggling with other players over properties you can gamble at opponents' casinos as well as fight over who is the boss of the casinos.  Obviously there is a lot of luck, but there are still important decisions to make.  The scoring is a bit odd.  In most games if a player receives 1 point he receives 1 point, but in this game the scoring scales so that after a while you have to receive 2 points at the same time in order to receive 2 points and so on.  As odd as this scoring system is, it seems to work as it forces players to change their strategy in the game.  I doubt I would ever buy this, but I would play it.

Felt a little bit like Acquire with tiles merging and takeovers.   You can then spend money to reroll dice to see if you can change "who's the boss" of that particular casino.

I have played this once so far with just my wife. Although she crushed me, both our first impressions are very positive on this game. Just lots of FUN. Sure there is a lot of luck, but the game also gives you the chance to take risks that could pay off big.

After two more plays, she crushed me again, and then I crushed her, so the game may be very swingy. Still lots of fun when those big risks pay off. 

After a few more plays, the game is very lucky. If everyone is playing a decent strategy, it seems like it comes down to who makes the best rolls or gets the rigth cards. The Up! expasion may help with this a little, but even so, it may not be that big of a deal because... high luck = high tension when rolling = high potential for exciting gaming moments = lots of fun!!

Do you like dice, can you handle the possibility of some randomness in life? Do you like economic games. Do you like area control games? Does the idea of running a casino - albeit in an entirely abstracted way  - appeal to you? If so you may like this game. I do. This very open, easily understood game about running a casino, with various casinos paying out money, and points based on size, is a lot of fun. Not quite a blast however as there's lots of erm erm how much do I owe you? And my casino pays out.... [waits to add dice together] 22 million dollars....

However that and a small gripe over the average components are the only negatives I have on this game. Everything else is positive; with this is a keeper for me, as it could go down well with the family (family dependent), spouse (spouse dependent), and a gamer group who aren't adverse to 'lighter' games, though there's enough here to be chewing for a while particularly with players of similar skill levels. This game is so simple that it's almost (stress on the almost) a gateway game. There are no contrived phases, just a list of actions that you can do as many times as you want on your turn (with the exception of gambling, which you can only do once) which makes you feel very free in terms of what you can do - that's if you can afford to do what you want. Can't afford it, you can always gamble at another player's casino. There does seem to be obvious choices sometimes, build big in colours that haven't been exhausted, expand so that your casino touches the strip; diversify in colour etc. This would all feel scripted, save for the fact that the board is tight enough that other players are always crawling all over you. 

Also, though I haven't really broken the ice on this one, the game has rules for negotiation, which run as follows: you can negotiate. So if you like that it's there and surely expands the game in directions not directly imaginable from the short ruleset.

This game has ok components, I use different dice to the ones provided, but what is there is fine. Also I substitute poker chips for the paper money, which I always do and will never mention in a review again as it's always true.

Finally: the game plays very well with just two also, which is becoming increasingly a must for me. Highly recommended.

The game is better than the box cover implies.  A bit of Acquire, a bit of craps, and a lot of hostile take-overs.  It's a bit too long, and there is a lot of banking required, but the way that you can take as many actions as you can afford on your turn makes it fairly interesting.   It's a highly random game, however.   The luck of the card draw makes all the difference.  Doesn't bother me, but I can see where some folks would be frustrated by that.  Colorful and vibrant, evoking the theme well.

Lords of Vegas is a game where players are casino developers vying for victory by acquiring money and earning points from the size of their casinos.  

There is a lot of luck in this game as there are plenty of card draws and die rolls.  However, the decisions of what type of casino to build can be decided based on which casino cards have been drawn (and thus less likely to come up again) as it is open information.  Die-rolls to reorganize casino ownership can also be weighted in your favor if you can position more dice in that casino than others.  

The scoring system with gateway point breaks (if you don't score over that amount, you cannot progress)  is awesome because it forces players to be aggressive or make deals with each other to get a casino big enough to keep scoring.    

The game is a ton of fun and is a great example of when mechanisms and theme come together perfectly.  Yes there is a lot of luck, but this is a game about Vegas after all.

There was a serious debate tonight regarding the rating of this game.  After consulting the BGG rating guidelines, I find that my initial response of wanting to give this game a 1 was inaccurate.  I find this game to be extremely annoying as opposed to completely broken.  Playing it felt like a chore and to be honest, I have never seen such hostility during a game.  The mechanics drive me insane; you have the option of purchasing lots you randomly are assigned but have little to no chance of getting lots you actually 'want'.  Expanding by surging or trading comes at great costs and the only deals that hit the table were usually one-sided and done solely to attempt to screw a third party from being casino boss.  Maybe it was just the group we played with; none of us are gamblers or so the theme was wasted on us.  About two-thirds of the way through my husband made the wise comment, "Chinatown is such a better game".  Once that was said, it felt almost pointless to finish this game.

Wow, how did I go so long in this hobby without playing this great game? Brilliant family game with a lot more luck than I thought there would be but that fits the theme. Game moves at a good pace and turns are intuitive. Components generally excellent but the paper money sucks. "Up" expansion included but I haven't tried it yet.

A really fun game.  It has an Acquire feeling, even though the mechanics are completely different. Very easy to teach, definitely an excellent gateway game, and for more experienced players a relly entertaining game.  A lot of luck its involved as it's expected of a Vegas theme game, however luck can be reduced by effective trading and planning.

Other people see something here that I just don't, so perhaps I'm missing how shrewd play will overcome the randomness in this one. Seems to me that while smart play is better than not so smart play, you're still at the mercy of the dice even if you play the probabilities. That's what gambling is -- trying to play the probabilities in your favor, right? And I get that this is a Vegas theme so the game mechanisms are built on gambling -- but that doesn't make it any more fun for me.

The good: Lords of Vegas is a great game for mud slinging and trash talking. The bad: You'll run out of trash long before the game ends.

In essence, players (more or less randomly) earn cash in casinos they built, then spend that cash trying to take over other players' casinos. That involves throwing dice. Lots of them. In some cases there are ways to slightly alter the probabilities in your favour but even in those cases whether you are successful is mostly down to plain dumb luck.

I mean, the game almost works as a light-hearted trash talking activity. For that kind of game it goes on much too long, however, and offers too little opportunities for retaliation. It's pretty frustrating if you just sit there and don't get to do anything.

On top of that the colour choices are abysmal. Unless you have great lighting, the yellow lot markers are almost invisible, the blue and green lot markers indistinguishable, same as the brown and purple casinos, closely followed by the yellow and gray casinos. Seriously, what were they thinking?

Comparisons to Chinatown are inevitable, although I would say this:  Chinatown is likely the better "game", but this one is certainly far more "fun".  The Vegas theme permeates the design and the actions are certainly thematic.  One big miss, however, was the inclusion of paper money.  If there was ever a game that begged for poker chips, its this one!  I liked it as a light fun game.  It is certainly too random to be taken as a heavy, serious game.

This seemed to have a lot of luck. The game was won based on who rolled their die higher than someone else (often in 50/50 chance) more consistently.

With a theme like Vegas it isn't surprising that the luck is high, but I would much rather play a luck-driven 15-30 minute game than a 60-90 minute one.

James Ernest is a a designer whose ideas I have long appreciated in theory more than gameplay, but with Lords of Vegas that has changed.  LoV is simply an amazing piece of game design that takes you on a crazy emotional rollercoaster with so many gut wrenching moments of dread followed by blissful states of euphoria.  

Naysayers will inevitably complain about luck (there are lots of dice in this game) and yes luck can have an influence in the outcome, but everything here is a calculated risk, and probabilities game, so you know going in everything is a gamble (which keeps the tension high). 

Taking risks can ensure strong progress, but a twist of fate can cause your charging empire to crumble. Lords of Vegas is wonderfully thematic, tense, and engaging throughout.  

With a few more plays this could easily be the game of the year for me, but either way Lords of Vegas has pushed it's way well into my all time favorite gaming experiences.

Only downside - the box art is terrible.  They should have chosen one of the images rather than make it look like some cheap clip art collage from hell.

This is a well-designed game, but it isn't quite my cup of tea. The random element can be a bit too punishing at times, while the decisions seem like a combination between area control and Acquire. For most people this would probably be a positive thing, but area control and Acquire are not two of my favorite things.
So try it out, especially if you don't mind a bit of luck. The mechanics are excellent, and the game play is speedy, so I think a lot of players will enjoy this offering more than I did.

So much fun! Had the feel like Cosmic where even though there is a lot of player interaction, you can't really get mad about it because it's mostly dictated by cards. A lot of dice chucking (but in a good way where it's more about probability as opposed to randomness - the dice rolling doesn't influence the area control element for example) and a lot of subtle strategy. Great negotiating.

Nice use of dice, with only occasional rolls.  These rolls cost resources, so won't be happening all the time and the uncertainty of the outcome adds to the whole vegas theme.

This game is awesome! Pure luck, one could say, but hey, this is Vegas, baby and luck is all you need here!

The game portrays that very well. Nice graphics of the casinos, dice, thematic cards and it's best if you get yourself real Vegas chips as money for the game. It enhances it even more. 

Game play is fun, but if things aren't going your way, you're not going to like it.  :)  Well, that's luck. And luck is a lady. Finicky. 

But it's a really enjoyable game, that almost makes you feel like you're at a casino striking it big... or not! Very nicely done.

Games in which chance rules tend not to be personal favorites.  I generally don't mind games dominated by luck provided the game is a short filler.  In longer games, however, I want strategy and/or tactics to be the predominant feature, with luck playing only a minor, if any role.  Games of Lords of Vegas have taken 1 ½ hours to complete, and there is simply too much luck present for a game of that duration.  

There are some fun aspects to the game.  Gambling is fun, albeit risky, and there are some clever steps a player can take in an attempt to grab ownership of an opponent's casino.  The result, however, is not guaranteed, so a player's careful plans are usually dependent upon the roll of the dice or the turn of a card.  I'm not happy with that.  So, while I find the theme appealing and applaud the effort to construct an appropriate atmosphere, there is simply too much luck present for my tastes.

This game has some interesting unique mechanics going on.  The scoring track escalation thing is interesting but I think ultimately gimmicky.  I'd rather just award all the points.  But in a different game it might work really well.  I liked the tension between needing to expand by sprawling and knowing that you might ultimately lose that spot anyway.  But the last couple turns devolved into one person after another paying to reorganize and roll for control.  That just isn't a fun endgame.

I'm both happy and disappointed in this game.  On one hand, the game is a lot of fun.  Turns move quickly, money is spent to make wild game swings, and there are some good strategic elements of risk management and area control.  Add to that a theme that I really like and the game itself is pretty good.

However, the amount of luck can be staggeringly debilitating.  Since payouts happen each player turn, you might set yourself up with a nice casino, just to have other players build into it and ravage the management, making themselves the boss.  You'll then find that you get no points at all as they're stolen out from you, because someone rolled higher than you to take over your casino and the card paying out to that color just happened to come out.  The end game becomes a flurry of dropping wads of cash to reroll half the board for casino dominance in the quest for points.  Unfortunately, the gambling action seems pretty useless, and only adding unnecessary risk in a game that already doles out an astronomical amount of cash in the late game.

Vegas Showdown will have to be my 'meatier' Vegas themed game, and this can be my lighter version that plays about an hour shorter.  Admittedly though, despite the flaws that make winning seem sort of pointless, the game itself is a lot of fun, and dice rolls can be pretty exciting.

Lords of Vegas is an area-control game set in Vegas, with similar blocks of casinos linked by color, and casinos controlled by dice.

There are a number of clever mechanisms to fight for control of the various casinos, but the name of the game is money, money, money.  Of course, controlling casinos is the best way to rake in the bucks, so there is a decent amount of competition for the various casinos.

The game also has a random payout order, and can end at different points based on the cards.

I like the game at this point, but I'm not in love with it.  I expect that will change with more people playing (so far I've been playing solo), and the interactive competition will gain from the flavor of the theme.

Fantastic game that sometimes has a runaway leader or severe loser (I guess just like the real Vegas). Usually, it's pretty tight with the scoring track mechanism, although sometimes the scoring requirements actually exacerbate the problem. Nevertheless, the Lords of Vegas is very fun and very thematic. We play with chips. I've found the game to work with two as well. As a probability management game, it has a lot of "skilled" moves, plenty of negotiation, back stabbing, and of course, luck. I recommend making everyone in charge of their own payouts. The best part is this game doesn't overstay its welcome, even at four. The expansion sounds nice, but unnecessary.

The second of three essential Vegas-themed games I own. The money and dice management gameplay is fluid and almost exhilarating at times, especially if the change of ownership happens by chance.  Using the cards played as somewhat of a "stock market statistic" adds direction and plenty of strategy. The gambling option is a nice touch as well.

The components are meh.  Many of the colors on the cards are not consistent and the paper money is a nuisance to handle.  Add in a few fiddly rules and I have to give the edge to Vegas Showdown.

Nevertheless, I have both in my collection for a reason, and I will always jump at the chance.  Hope your rolls be 2 or 12.

I am torn with this game. On the one hand, I hate how swingy the dice rolls can be. However, with some smart play you can sort of stay in the running against bad luck. Either way, don't get too invested and you might enjoy yourself.

RATING: 5
A Chinatown-style area building game with high cost dice rolls used to settle disputes over who owns the larger sites. The problem is, the amount of money in the game spirals towards the end, leading to insanely high stakes roll-offs to control the larger casinos that still have scoring potential. Some fun here, but a game decided entirely by luck.

This is definitely an area control style game...it has some take that and some "the player with the most gets best" in it.  Since you don't get to choose the areas that you go into so much as the game tells you it doesn't feel like other players are personally out to get you, even thought the mechanics certainly allow for it.  The expansion is great and add a great option that gives it a very different feel.

Great game. A game for all types, although it will drive the strategist mad. Moderate teaching difficulty, but play becomes pretty clear about half way through the first game. Use poker chips for additional theme. My only complaint is that this game comes down to dice rolling often, so it's impossible to win without luck. But as long as you surrender to the dice and have fun, it's a good time.

RATING: 10
Acquire (which I love) with lots of dice. And trading. And simple rules and an awesome theme. Every game of this that I've played has been different, but all have been interesting and fun. There's a definite feeling of "something's always happening" -- a new lot owned each turn, a new payout each turn, a reorganization or remodel that changes the power balance -- which keeps everyone engaged as they try to figure out how to take advantage of the new situation. 

Yes, luck is a significant factor, but so is smart play. And the dramatic changes in fortune really fit the theme in this game and make for a heck of a roller-coaster ride. 

This game also has the coolest component that I never use: While I love that Dino, Frank, and The King are on the paper money in this game, there are so many transactions with the bank that using poker chips instead really helps. 

[b]Update:[/b] With the Up expansion, I rate this game a 10, since it addresses the minor complaints I had about the end game.

Tried Lords of Vegas for myself the other day, and we liked it a lot! We only messed up in two areas. First, we allowed unlimited gambling. This only stood to make the welcoming casino owner richer, so I don't feel we "broke" the game in that sense. In the future, I could see us allowing more than one roll on a turn (because it was fun; it played into our group's natural gambling tendencies). Second, we let dice-less casinos remain "owned" by the person who left it. This meant a player regained his die-less block when his sprawl backfired. That rule probably needs to be returned to its original intent.

Lords of Vegas is enjoyable, but it has a bit too much luck (with dice-rolling) for me to put it into a list of my favorite gateway games. The emphasis on luck is thematic, but it undermines some of the fun I get from the strategic planning in the game. Not a bad game at all, I still prefer the drier and less thematic (but more strategic) Vegas Showdown for my casino-themed game of choice.

Initial Rating: 4.0 (September 2013)

At first it was a blast, but the game is way too long for what it offers, however when I was about to write this comment, I found out from my geek buddies, that this game has negotiation rules :S, I read the rules and sure enough, my friend explained to me with two mistakes. 1. Most important, he never mentioned we could trade. 2. The gambling rules were also mistaken, however I think this had a low impact in our game. 

Still I feel this is a forgettable and boring game, it has lots of uncontrollable luck in many layers (dice, cards, gambling) but the worst for me are the cards  that comes in each turn, you know the odds but that is not enough to plan ahead successfully, moreover, on a game this long. Also you can be screwed by the dice when another player tries to get over your casino. Not fun for me, all your careful plans can be destroyed by luck in a single turn. The theme does nothing for me one way or another.

I would play again with the correct set of rules to see if this improves my experience, but (even though I love negotiation games) I doubt it. I wish the game lasted around a fifth of its current length. For me, a game this long should not have this level of randomness, it should be the strategy the dominant factor :(.

I purchased this last week and played it a couple of times and I HIGHLY recommend it.  There's a lot of luck involved, because it is a dice based game, but between the theme and the gameplay, the luck isn't bad to deal with.  I haven't had a game where people aren't standing up because of some intense dice rolling.

RATING: 8.8
Every time I have played this game I have had a blast. it plays very quickly as each round you are invested in some way; even if it is cheering for the dice as some one gambles there entire turn (money) in an opponents casino.
This game is all about being cutthroat but it some how doesn't feel that bad as everybody is shifting for position, leaving the game mostly balanced. if one person dose shoot ahead usually the rest of the players will gang up to restore equilibrium. Also the score track is very cleaver: you can only go so far before you have to grow, making small point obsolete. A AMAZING catch up mechanism.

My initial impression after one 4 player game is that this is a fun, family weight game. It reminds me a little of Monopoly, but better in every way. Our game ran a bit long (like 2.5 hours). We didn't have any AP, but we were learning the game, so hopefully that length will shrink (a lot). We also had one player that just got beat up by the game, and was never really in it. I'm guessing that that was just bad luck, and that most games would be more fun for everyone involved, in which case, my rating will improve.

Enjoyed this more than I expected. Yes, more luck than I am accustomed to liking, but not as much as I feared. There are elements to the game that provide a sufficient amount of control - especially for a game that is really about playing the odds. The main reason I've decided to keep this game is that it is an economic game that I would feel comfortable introducing to non-gamers. I think the appeal could be that broad. Solid effort and very creative application of dice. And for the record, since this comment has been made by more than one of my geekbuddies, I do not think the game is too long for what it is. 60-90 minutes feels about right.

This game has a mix of strategy and randomness. The randomness seems to fit the theme. You upgrade your spots to casinos and can merge with other players. Then you can fight for control. As cards come out you get money and victory points. Players tend to remodel casinos to other colors with more cards left in the deck. There is some nice player interaction. There is nothing too deep, but it offers some fun times.

Good board control and betting hybrid. Is fun with non gamers and can get very mean and nasty with everyone plotting to take over each others casino. 

There is a lot of luck in the game, but all the information is open so the risks can be managed sufficiently. This game does generate stories that you will remember amongst your friends... do you remember when the guy with 1 dice in the casino took control against the other 2 players with 4 each and it paid out 3 times?

Great stuff.

RATING: 8
This and Carcassone are my 2 preferred gateway games.  While LoV is a game about luck (of course it is, it's about property magnates in Vegas!!) it's also almost NOT about luck.  This is a game of suckering your opponents, speculating on the right opportunities, risk management, psyching and bluffing. 

how do you split your revenue across the different casino types? whose casinoes do you risk merging with? How much are you willing to pay to win a coup over the oppositions managers?

The reason that this game works is down to length. it's reasonably short and reasonably straight forward.  It's not a game that plays long enough to get seriously invested.  At worst, you laugh out loud as a cruel opponent swipes victory from your hands.  For a game to be this troll-tastic and still funny is a real achievement!

Interesting game.  Looking forward to playing it more.  Seems like 2 player is not as good as 3 or 4, since trading seems to be the most effective way to bring about your evil plans.  Accepting a trade in a 2er game seems like a mistake for one of the parties.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
No other way to put it - highly luck dependent, but what else could you expect from a game with a Vegas theme. But there are so many ways to mitigate your luck, like pushing for that lucky dice roll to take over the casino your opponent has worked so hard to create - even better if you can do so right before it scores. Or gambling in his casino with the hopes of depleting his assets right before he can make a big move. Or the unbelievable luck when he tries to take his casino back and rolls a 6 for you... So many great moments in any given game. Possibly plays a bit long for what it is, but the highs and lows of each game more than make up for it.

Somehow this game caught my attention although everything here screams "not for me - too much random". Lots get assigned randomly, payouts are mostly random, high stake unfriendly overtake actions can screw you and the icing on the cake is the possibility to gamble against another player for an amount which increases during the game but basically corresponds to all the money you have in hand. Nonetheless, I enjoyed my play for reasons I can't put a hold on. Just not enough to fork out 35 EUR while I can get so many other games for less money that don't have the potential to be a major annoyance.

This game feels like I'm playing a table game in Vegas inside of a board game. I just love it. The pieces are great quality. Every dice roll is so exciting. It pays homage to gambling while offering a non life-ruining alternative. If you like Vegas, you need this game.

Because I can get pretty much anyone to play it, I'm calling it "Gamer's Monopoly". To me, it fixes all the problems of Monopoly, while maintaining the game focus of creating the largest property set. I still really like it, but I'd rather play it with my non-gamer friends and family and play something that feels less like you're running the books for a casino.

It's a game about Vegas so it's full of luck. You will get hosed on card draws and dice rolls. I still had a blast playing it.

It's not a long game. I think it would be easy to get non-gamers to play. There's enough strategy to keep gamers interested however. 

I thought the bits and artwork were nice. I'm not a big theme guy but, in this case, I though the theme was perfect.

Lots of luck in this game, but I ABSOULTELY don't mind it.  It so well brings to life the swings of luck and the ups and downs of gambling in Vegas.  It feels like a better implementation of Monopoly.  You can wheel and deal with you opponents to try to buy them out of a lucrative unimproved property, or go for broke and try to reorganize a casino you only have a minority stake in.

The dice will reward and punish you equally in this game and it has had some shout out loud cheering moments.  Don't expect strategy to win out in this game, but it is GREAT at what it does.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I don't really care about the theme, and the game length is simply too long for a game where luck plays such a dominant role. I don't mind luck (and it seems like luck is pretty thematic when you consider the setting of the game), but I didn't feel like my decisions made much of a difference and never felt engaged with the game.  The worst criticism you can give a game of this type is that it felt boring.

Why play this when you can play Acquire?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Lords of Vegas is two-dimensional Monopoly. I mean that in every sense of the term: Monopoly's board is literally one-dimensional (once you get past the looping nature, it's easy to visualize, but more importantly, you can only ever go one direction) whereas LoV is two-dimensional. More meaningfully, Monopoly has very little depth to it in terms of gameplay and Lords of Vegas has at least one layer deeper gameplay.
When I say that Lords of Vegas is the best Monopoly variant ever, I mean exactly that. It doesn't transcend the genre, but it does outclass it.
My final note is that I bought the game because I saw a lot of dice on the back cover. You don't roll them very often. I found that disappointing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Easy to learn and great fun!  The trading and negotiation aspect doesn't come into play much with two players, but I expect that to blossom with more.
There is definitely a bit of Acquire and Chinatown in this, plus some other stuff I've yet to identify.

Comments after 1 play.

I was taught by someone who played it only once and we weren't sure about some of the rules.  However, unless we missed something significant, this is not the game for me.

It is totally random which properties you get, and it doesn't seem like the costs make up for the differences.  In our game, we spent the last few turns trying to take over one casino.  Pretty much the guy who won it and scored with it was the winner.  However, it took about 2 hours to get to this point.

Supposedly there is trading in this game, and we weren't aware of this for half of the game.  However, I don't think we would have traded anyway since we didn't know what was going on.

Will keep my eye on getting this as a gateway game to people that like the gambling/property aspect of Monopoly. I've only played a 6-player game and the game felt way too random. Random card draw and bad die rolls can really put you at a disadvantage that is almost impossible to recover from in a 6-player. Will want to try this at 4 before I rule this one out completely.

► Best area control game.

Easy rules, great and solid game design, nice art (except for the box cover), very confrontational and interactive gamplay plus a completely opened-up action and trading phase. I consider this game to be the meaner and more fun brother of the classic [thing=5][b]Acquire[/b][/thing].

Many people don't like dice rolling and luck in their games, and yes, there is indeed a [b]lot[/b] of dice rolling and luck involved here, but it perfectly fits to the game's theme and the high amount of dice rolling evens out nicely over the course of the game.
Having said that, there are ways for increasing the own odds (and decreasing those of the opponents) with the dice, and knowing where and how to pull this off it is an essential part of this game.

The trading/negotiation options in this game are fantastic and completely opened-up, offering very interesting and unique options to the ongoing power struggle on the board. Besides the regular money/casino or casino/casino tile trades, you can do things like funding player A for attacking player B who might be a common enemy or making a non-secure ("sprawled") casino tile of your own a part of a trade, hoping that the other player maybe forgot that the final owner of that tile is still in dispute (meaning: if the corresponding card gets drawn, the owner immediately changes to the person who drew that card).

The scoring track also deserves to be mentioned, as its simple yet clever concept prevents players from running away with points and slowly and relatively increases the challenge of the game for everyone over time.

The components are great: thick cardboard casino tiles, nice artworks and overall very colourful components, helping at maintaining an overview of the board. The very colourful components are also providing the game with a really nice side effect, as the Nevada desert starts pretty dark at the beginning of the game, but increasingly lights up in all these different and bright colours.

Two points of critique: first, the inlay is from a different game. It works, but it is still irritating and a bit embarassing for the publisher, as this game deserves better. Secondly, paper money is absolutely outdated in board games nowadays, but it's nice that the bank notes are illustrated appropriately, showing famous entertainers of Las Vegas and values of $1-10 million.

This game replaces the (still enjoyable !) 1962's classic [b]Aquire[/b] in my opinion. Yes, they are different in detail, but if I want to play a game of area control and high competition, I will always choose the more interactive and straight-forward [b]Lords of Vegas[/b] over the more passive and stock market-calculating [b]Acquire[/b].
It's also a nice surprise that (unlike [b]Acquire[/b]) the amount of money does [b]not[/b] determine the winner of the game, but the amount of victory points accumulated by taking clever turns, striking good deals with other players and taking the right amount of risk.

If you like [b]Acquire[/b], definitely give [b]Lords of Vegas[/b] a shot (and vice versa).

As I was flowing thru the game, I felt like I'd rather be playing Chinatown.  The negotiation aspects of money/plots/casinos was similar but the high randomness in gambling didn't fit my personal preferences.  There are more casino/gambling games I'd prefer and this mixture didn't really win me over that much.

RATING: 6
LIKES:

* Dice are used creatively in this game.  You purchase them at a set number initially, but can later pay to "reorganize" which allows you re-roll your dice to try and get a better number and become the boss!  The highest number die determines the boss which grants points.  Otherwise, the number of pips indicates income regardless of who is the Boss.
* Reminds me of some elements of Acquire, but with a good bit more chance and potentially risk-taking.  You can purchase for double the price an adjacent area but risk losing it if an opponent ends up pulling that card.
* Rules are well laid out and easily explained.

DISLIKES:

* Initial impression is that there should be more dice for two player games.  However, another play might see that we use our dice a bit more selectively so we don't trap ourselves into a situation where we cannot score points higher on the point track.
* I dislike the quick rate at which the difficulty to score points on the score track occurs.  Catchup mechanisms can be nice, but this felt extreme.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Fun and interesting variant to the "Acquire-style" games of attempting to join blocks on a grid to make larger, more powerful structures.  Among the most clever addtions here is a money gathering system that recalls Settlers in providing you with cash during a random phase of other people's turns that can be planned for (by considering what cards have been used already) but never fully anticipated. The gambling mechanism is a clever way to try to maximize one's turn options when your cash on hand is tantalizingly close to what you needed.  A solid entry into a somewhat crowded field.

I like games that really challenge what mechanics you can do with dice, and Lords of Vegas does some weird stuff with dice.  Reorganizing casinos is really one of the oddest push-your-luck mechanics I've seen.  I really like the scoring system, especially since it really does get harder and harder to meet the threshold of more points.  I will say that there is a ton of luck, from the card deck to the die rolling.  I've won the game solely by claiming a lot that another player put hard work into sprawling into.

Players turn over a card to get a new location on the board.  These locations also score for those colors.  There are various rules if your area is larger and you have control over the casino.  You can buy new locations, reorganize or try to take over a casino.  You score points on a track where you need ever greater point scores to advance.  

The game has a bit of a runaway leader problem.  But overall the experience is a fun one.  I have heard that the new expansion Up! adds a lot to the game but I have not played. it.

played through solo. looking ok but maybe a little dissapointing compared to the hype.

Second solo play, this is a more complicated version of Chinatown (which I think is better). There is more going on here - maybe after playing a bit you would grasp it but it seems slow. You don't seem to be getting anywhere And there is no incentive to try and get a large casino. The rules explain each step but you do not get a feel for why you would want to do anything.

It’s like Acquire, but you roll dice to determine the winner after about half an hour. And then you continue to play for another hour.

Well, it’s not quite that bad, but it comes close. While it would be churlish to complain about randomness in a game with Vegas in its title, there is so much inherent sloppiness in this design that it feels a bit as though its designers did not really care. It could be a personal thing, but I feel that there a good and bad ways to incorporate random events in a game, and Lords of Vegas does two things that feel particularly bad. First, it makes no effort to rectify the advantage of the first player, even though it would have cost very little effort to do so. Second, the way ties are handled needlessly draws out the die rolling and leeches the drama out of it: Hey, I’ve got a five! No wait, I don’t ... now it’s a four ... oh, now it’s a two ... are we there yet? Again, possible solutions are trivially easy to find (e.g. re-roll the ties; winning die keeps the original value, all others get decreased by one pip), and the fact that they’re not in the game is disappointing.

I’ve had five minutes of fun in my one play of this, but they were buried in one and a half hours of game. That might be an impressive portrayal of the real Vegas experience, but it sure won’t make me come back for another go.

Although it's a bit odd to teach (everyone seems to have a hard time understanding the payouts at first), it's an outstanding entry level game in the hobby.  Allows enough strategizing to make your decisions feel important.  Luck provides a balance to strategy with die rolling and gambling.  The theme is well integrated with the "push your luck" aspect of so many actions.  Any I always feel accomplished after my little Las Vegas has built up by the end of the game.

Took this with us on our cruise and got in 2 three player games.  First one was a learning experience, 2nd one went much better and was lots of fun.

Not very thematic, but much easier and since one of us is extremely impatient, it might be our preferred method of scoring even at home.

Wonderful game that hits that sweet spot of mixing luck and strategy.  Has shades of Acquire with some gambling elements thrown in for good measure.  Love that the reveal beats happen at the top of each turn.  Somebody's always gaining something with each turn.  And big kudos to the "break" device in the score - a very clever mechanism that forces players to make big moves as the game progresses.

RATING: 5
The mechanics in this game are not intuitive, and it's not until an hour into it that one starts to understand the consequences of one's decisions. I thought the mechanics were inorganic — they didn't flow naturally from the theme and pieces. I don't like the abstract pips on the dice showing who's the most powerful "boss" in each casino. The scoring system was a bit cumbersome, and I was bored waiting for my turn each time.

I liked the way the board and the pieces and cards looked in the beginning. I wish the designers had found a better way to make a game of it.

Not terrible, but a disappointment nonetheless.

RATING: 7
This is a fun game. It's a euro, yet it's not; there's a ton of luck throughout, but it can be controlled in many ways and it feels like it washes out -- mostly -- over the course of the game.

The theme is amazingly well integrated. Every mechanic involves something that feels Vegas-y, generally some sort of gamble, and the progression of the game drives player behavior that roughly fits the history of the Strip -- for example, consolidating casinos to create mega-casinos. It's clever.

In my first game there was one turn that felt a bit dull, but every other turn presented options and gave me interesting decisions to make. It's got a unique vibe that's like nothing else in my collection.

The components range from excellent (board, tiles) to serviceable; the dice and chips are a bit cheap, but not so much so that it detracts from the overall experience. I'll begrudgingly concede that this is a game that demands paper money, despite my dislike for it. You handle money constantly, and paper money is a simple solution.

I understand why gamers prefer games with no luck and all strategy; however, sometimes I really want a game where knowing when and how to push your luck can pay off. This game really lets you do that with a great mix of strategy and luck. You essentially build and bet on which hotels will do the best and can gamble away your opponents' cash to cripple them (or loose yourself and boy's that's bad!).

PLAYS GREAT WITH 2, DON'T LISTEN TO THE NAYSAYERS! 

This game should get more press! Before I acquired it, I had only heard of Lords of Vegas through random geeklists and game comparisons. Don't get me wrong, it's not like Lords of Vegas is completely off the map. People talk about about, but not enough. This game is truly special. 

Gameplay: A game I love, that LOV reminds me quite a bit of is Chinatown. It takes the lot/block element of Chinatown, and the "growth element." Interestingly, this game does not provide an exponential payout, only an even one. I like that because it's easier to teach, but I prefer Chinatown's model overall as it feels more strategic. Of course, it also takes the trading element from Chinatown, which is one of the highlights of the game. I'm actually saying this hypothetically, because I have only played a 2-player game where no trading occurred. There were several turns in a 2 player game where I didn't want to build, gamble, etc., where I might have wanted to trade. The downside to trading in this game, and something I've heard mentioned by others is that it slows the game down. I could see that. The thing is--in Chinatown, all you really do is trade (and acquire property and goods through random elements). In this game, however, you can do so much more: remodel, reorganize, gamble and sprawl. There's a huge amount of variety offered each turn, and trading would only serve to offer the most rich and complex option. I would probably have to shorten the game a bit with 4 (possibly putting the end of game tile 2/3 of the way down rather than 3/4). That said, I didn't feel like it was long at all with 2. It was just right, actually. Nevertheless, this game just edges out Chinatown for me (which I love). The extra choices and flexibility adds some strategic depth and thematic flavor. 

Negatives??: One potential problem I've heard voiced by others is that this game can drag if you're not doing well, and that there's really no catch-up mechanism. I disagree. While I beat my wife by 30 points (which is a lot in this game), there are several events that could have triggered a comeback for her. The bottom line is that in an information game (no luck), there is often a point that if a player is doing poorly enough, his/her opponent can easily run away with the game, and this can be quite obvious. I understand that. I also understand that the only way to catch up, in most cases, is for the leader to start to play poorly (unlikely). BUT, in a highly luck-driven game like Lords of Vegas, anything can happen. A certain chain of events can propel the player in last place into first. It's just a matter of chance. This is the case with Lords of Vegas, I'm sure. 

Components: The components leave something to be desired. Mayfair is not known for their quality components, and they didn't seem to splurge here. The tiles are relatively sturdy, and the dice are fairly small. The paper money is unforgivable. The only saving grace is the decent graphic design and nice art on the board. So, all in all, a 4 out of 10. It's actually amazing I like this game as much as I do, considering I"m a component guy. I will say that I played with poker chips rather than paper money. That probably helped a lot. 

So, do I like it? Yes. Do I love it? Yes. Is it going to ever make my top 10. It's possible. But for now, I'm going to rate it a solid 9! If you get a chance pick it up!

Update 6/29/2016:

I played this 2 more times with 4 players this week. Not surprisingly, it's better with 4. I would argue that it is a LOT better IF players are willing to negotiate. Otherwise, it's simply a bit tighter. Either way, the game itself is simply excellent. I absolutely love it.

Gives me the Acquire vibe. While i think Acquire is a superior game, its also intimidating and tense. Lords of Vegas has an easier barrier to entry, with more stand up excitement moments filled with anticipation of the dice roll. This one provides a good laugh and is fun because of some of the luck factor involved. The more players the better in this one if you ask me. the Up expansion is great, and scales play up nicely to 6 players.

This game rocks.  James Ernest is a dude.  I have never failed to play a game of this where players were not jumping up and down.  Trading and making deals with players is a less obvious part of the game.  This is particularly important if one player draws good lots.  Other players must make deals to improve their positions.  This is why the game is not a good two-player game.

Strange game with a surprisingly high learning curve. It is easy to learn how to make legal moves, but to learn when to sprawl, negotiate, and gamble takes a couple of plays. By the second game, we were having more fun taking over each others casinos and gambling. However, the lots were so spread out and so random, it limited our interaction. Different plays of this game can be widely different depending on luck and whether you are a newbie to the game. Overall, a fun game that is a nice change of pace from brain burners and has great potential for player interaction and trash talking. It's too bad that it doesn't happen every play.

Based off one 2-player game.  Good, fun game, but I need to get it to the table with 4 players.

Update: Have played a handful of 4-player games.  This game requires 4 in my opinion.  Usually this game is a ton of fun, but I've had some big duds too.  I think it hurts if the casinos are not built somewhat evenly (i.e. if nobody builds the purple casinos).  In my dud games, we ran out of tiles, dice, etc. and it was much less interesting.

Far too much luck for a game of its length. It took two hours for us to finish a three-player game. For the first half of the game there is the illusion of strategy and money is fairly tight. But eventually everyone has a decent supply of money and can encroach on other casinos, switch colors, pay to reroll all the dice, and have a 40:60 or 45:55 chance of ending up with a massive casino. It is these late crapshoots that make the difference. Chaos increases massively as the game progresses. Early decisions should offer some reward but really don't.

Lords of Vegas is, at its thematic heart, a betting game. The players take on the roles of casino moguls on the Strip, building, remodelling and taking over casinos in an attempt to make the most money and score the most prestige, which is basically a VP system and will win or lose you the game. As VP systems go, this one has a neat twist, but we’ll get to that in a bit. Firstly, let’s look at how the game works.

The board is divided into six areas representing city blocks. These are further divided into a varying number of ‘lots’ and each has an assigned value represented by the printed face of a 6-sided die. 

There is a deck of cards with one card for each lot on the board, and each card also has the name of a casino chain on it. It should be stated that the casino and the lot bear no actual relation, and the lot is not tied to a particular chain. The lot is a space allocated to the player who turns the card, whilst the casino simply denotes the chain which will pay out on the current player’s turn. There is one card for each lot on the board, and each has one of the six casino chains marked on its front. There are eight cards per chain (I believe), therefore as cards come out and are placed on their chains, the likelihood that the chain will pay out again decreases. However, the odds are further randomised by the fact that not all cards will come out. The deck is shuffled and then split 75%-25%. An End Game card is placed on top of the 25% deck (can’t remember if this is then shuffled to give a further randomisation of the end point, or if it’s a guaranteed end after 75% of the deck has been played out), and the 75% deck is then placed on top. The cards below the End Game card will not appear, so the number of cards per casino which turn up will vary with each game.

To start, two cards are turned over for each player and the lot on the face is allocated to that player. The card is then placed on the chain row for its casino so that everyone can assess the odds of future payouts.

After this first round, each player will have two lots on which to build if they so choose. Unbuilt lots pay the owner $1m on each player’s turn.

At the start of a player’s turn, they first turn over a card from the deck. They then put a marker on the lot they’ve acquired and everyone collects cash for their lots. The casino chain represented on the card face then pays out. We’ll come back to how this works, but first, let’s assume the player wants to build.

Each lot is marked with a purchase price which the owner can pay. They then build a new casino, or extend one which they control (they can build more if they have the cash). A casino is represented by all linked tiles of the same colour, regardless of the die colour occupying that space. A chain is all tiles of one colour, which may be separated by block or may simply not yet connect by lot. Control is a simple mechanism in that, as stated previously, each lot has a die number on it. When someone builds a new casino, they place a casino tile matching their chosen chain, and place a die of their colour at its centre with the uppermost face showing the value shown on the lot (and repeated on the lot card). The highest die value controls the casino. Other players may place connecting tiles of the same colour and, if their highest die is greater in value than that of the current owner, then they take control. 

All players with dice in a casino will get money when the casino pays out, but only the controlling player will be given points. The amount of money you receive is equal, in millions, to the total number of pips on your dice in that chain.

Players who have a stake in a particular casino can choose to wrestle for control by paying millions equal to the total number of die pips for all players in the contested casino (not the chain, just that particular casino). They then re-roll all dice for the casino with the highest number gaining control. It’s easy to see how having fewer dice than other players in a casino is a disadvantage as the odds are always with the percentage.

There is also the opportunity to remodel, which is a strong tactical action which can see casinos rapidly expand, or be aggressively taken over. And if you’re ever short of money to achieve what you want, you can always lay bets off against your opponents. All bets must be accepted, although players can choose to have the bank take half the risk, which means the bank also shares any gains.

I mentioned earlier that the VP system is innovative, though the innovation is simple: there is a ‘brake’ (or ‘break’, I’m not sure if it’s a gambling term, but the idea of a braking system suits) which kicks in when players achieve a certain number of points. As stated, points are scored by the controller of a casino, but this might suggest a strategy of building small, single lot casinos in order to maintain control. The game prevents this by requiring a minimum of two points to be scored once a certain level is reached, or the player scores none - and hence the brake. Later, a casino must score three points minimum in order to score at all; then four and five, and so on up to nine ( though anyone achieving this automatically wins the game).

The problem for me with Lords of Vegas is that it pretty much perfectly fits its theme. I am not a gambler and I have never understood the pleasure it gives people. Like anyone, I understand that, even for someone skilled, the odds are always with the house. I have therefore never been able to comprehend why people put their money at such risk. Yes, there is the opportunity, on occasion, to “win big”, but the plain fact is that, for anyone disposed to this kind of pursuit, the house is going to get you. At some point, you’re going to lose big, too. And therein lies the rub: my grandfather was a horse-racing fanatic, and a great studier of form. When the Grand National rolled around, he would lay bets for the whole family and we’d all sit around to watch and see who won. He would get the return of his stake and whomever backed the winning horse got to keep the rest. I tell you this because the chance to win never seemed likely to me, and I did not find it exciting. If you lay a bet for me and the horse loses, my response is: “Well, of course. What did you expect?” Professional pundits can’t predict with any measure of reliability, so how is some kid supposed to name a horse from a list?

So, as a thematic game, Lords of Vegas is certainly one of the most successful I’ve ever come across. Everything, from the die placement and rolling to the lot acquisition and payout, is a gamble. It works. It’s about assessing odds, taking risks and going all out for a big win…

… But if that’s not your bag, then it also works against it. It is a clever mix of mechanisms, yes, but exploiting those mechanisms, in the end, had nothing to do with my winning. I had some good and bad rolls, as did everyone else, but the spread of good rolls favoured me on this occasion. Yes, I mitigated that with some shrewd building which meant the odds were with me for control for most of my builds, but Andy’s choices were a lot better than mine, and Mike was very aggressive, but unlucky, whilst Anna had the other two seeming to gang up against her. 

And so I feel I won the game on Wednesday because I understood that the odds were irrelevant; that the only way to win was to take big risks, so I routinely spent as much as I could afford and would have done so more often if I’d had the cash available. And because I was so reckless, I really felt I had nothing invested in the game at all because I am not a gambler. And if you don’t feel invested, then the risk isn’t really a risk, it’s just randomness. Perhaps, for someone who feels the thrill of putting bets on, this may evoke something of that essence. For me, we might as well have each rolled a die and decided the winner on that.

Lords of Vegas: so very good, yet so very dull.

This game is worth the time it takes to read through the instructions! There are a lot of pieces and elements to Lords of Vegas, but all come together seamlessly for an entertaining game that will hold up over many plays.  Especially great are the elements of the game that mirror its Vegas theme: the importance of balancing strategy, odds, and of course, luck, recur over and over in multiple ways.  Excellent game!

I hate to admit that I was enticed into this one by the Cult of Wheaton.  I like the player interaction in this game.  The ability to trade/haggle/coerce makes up for the "luck" factor of the dice.  The paper money should have been replaced with chips and I'm sorry but it has to be said...what the #$@%! is up with the box?  What are you suppose to store in that?!?!?!  I might have rated the game higher if it had a box that wasn't so frickin' silly.  Really fun game though.  Truly it lost 1 point for its box...could have been a 9 :-P 

Update:  Still hate the box but get past it due to love of the game.  I rarely (if ever) win, but its fun enough that I still want to play it

Update 2.0: Bumped the rating to 9 as its still getting to the table and its still fun

This game never fails to create epic experiences.  The theme oozes throughout every aspect of the game.  There is luck, but tactics (and even a bit of strategy) will almost always balance it out.  This is an under-appreciated gem.  When a game consistently creates stories, you know it's good.

Dice rolling FUN! This game has great mechanics that work fluidly and simply. At its core, this is an area control game. Most of the time, the person with more presence in a block is the one that is the boss. The dice play a perfect complement to the theme, add just enough uncertainty, and always provide the fun. Sometimes it can go a little long for me, but as long as players don't overthink their turns, the game can play in 90 minutes and be just the right length for what it offers.

Fun game of area control, gambling and stealing.  Really takes the gambling theme to the next level with a board of hotels that you build hoping they'll pay out later à la [thing=5]Acquire[/thing].  Payouts increase depending on how large your hotels are.  Perhaps it's the map but some bits also reminded me of [thing=1471]Gangsters[/thing].  

What makes the game really fun is that you can pull off some evil maneuevers in taking over hotel franchises from your opponents.  You can evil gamble at other player's casinos when you're desperate for quick cash.

Only played once, with 6 other people (in teams, I was by myself). 

3 of the players really liked it. 3 of them did not, but they saw all the dice and instantly judged the game as a luckfest before even playing. These three didn't pay attention and subsequently, missed adding up points and playing properly. The three of us that did pay attention really saw a fun game in here. Excellent at what it is, I want to play it again. It's perfect as a casual quick, easy, fun game.

*edit March 2013, almost a year later* Finally got in a second game. Was pretty much a learning game for all of us but it was a great game. This is the game people think Monopoly is... a healthy dose of luck mitigated by skillful trading. Sometimes the dice are with you, sometimes not, but the entire game is over in 60 minutes no matter how bad it goes for you. What a great game and a good one to bring out for casuals.

played our first game last night and it was a big hit.  My wife was a little skeptical about it in the game store, but after playing it she now sees what I saw in it.  Only played it once and we did mess up the rules in that we only allowed the actions in the second stage to occur once which really messed things up but we could still tell it was a wicked cool little game.

After a dozen plays, I am bumping this up to a full 10. Almost all of my games have come down to the wire, including several where the game came down to a tied score with a few million dollar difference deciding the winner. Best win ever was me losing by 20 points and throwing all of my money into die re-rolls, including a casino where I was outnumbered 7 to 2, and taking over control of every single casino on the board. Next card up was Game Over, allowing me to tie the game on score. After payouts I had a ten million dollar edge and won the game. My opponent was literally stunned.

This game is so well balanced that it is really hard to have a runaway winner. The more you build up your score early, the harder it is to maintain it later in the game as you are statistically less-likely to have your color come up again. This game brilliantly balances strategy with luck, in that you can always figure out the probabilities and plan accordingly. That way, good strategy is always more likely to win, though sometimes a straight up gamble pays off. Love it!

RATING: 4.5
Luck, dice, strategy based on randomness and guessing...  all the things I hate in a game...

Maybe if there was some way to mitigate where you got to own a lot, or you could pay to increase your dice roll for ownership (Boss status) then it would be marginally better.

As it stands, this is purely a game for those who don't want to think for themselves, and let the game just play itself

Light dice heavy euro. Trying to gain the most points by owning the largest casinos. You can steal money off of players by gambling at their casinos, or better yet, you can steal their casinos. I've seen a runaway leader only once, but I think it could end up being more common if players don't work together to hurt a large casino early in the game. The theme fits perfectly.

Fun, Chaotic, hostile takeovers, dice, paper money and gambling.  We keep forgetting that you can trade with other players. People say you should use poker chips instead of paper money.

RATING: 8
High on the list of "Euros That Do No Suck" - in part because there is a dangerous push your luck element, and much of the strategy of the game is about managing chaos and playing the other players, rather than is the case in the typical euro were players wank over perfect information as it relates to the optimal move in a particular turn. 

Indeed, I'd almost be tempted to call this Ameritrash, since it's highly confrontational - you can "attack" other players and take VP away from them by rerolling dice or merging buildings and swapping out building colors so that you suddenly become a boss, you can "steal" from players by gambling in their casinos, AND ratcheted on top of all of this is a massive metagame element with the negotiation and trading that can (and does) occur through the whole experience. And given the 1) limited pool of buildings, 2) limited number cards that trigger payouts and vp (only 9 per building type!), and 3) limited pool of dice, the fight for premium space and control is like a knife fight in an alleyway.

This is a seriously cool, extremely clever and well-designed game that I will almost always say yes to, given the opportunity.

I like the pace and flow of this game.  Rightup until the end, there is a strong desire to build up cash and then spend it all on your turn, so that someone doesn't gamble and take it all.  Thus, your are incented to not hoard money.  I also like how the point gap system on the scoring track provides for a good catch-up mechanism.

RATING: 6
This is definitely not a "Euro" or "strategy" game, as the constant use of dice and cards are going to take players on a roller coaster ride of luck...but that's kind of the point. The theme here is superbly integrated, with everything supporting that Vegas casino feel. (Gambling at other players' casinos was a nice touch, even if you shouldn't ever do it.) Unfortunately, my first game started to drag a little bit at the end, because I'd "experienced" all the nifty new features of the game and my best strategy was to not do any of it on most of my turns. That would have been easily forgiven if the game, which had clearly been decided already, had ended, but it just kept going. I think sub-optimal play probably set that situation up and also made the game go too long--probably 90 instead of 60 minutes--but I'd readily play again. Well done.

Lowered rating from a 7 to a 6, and now to a 4. My initial review went on at some length about how even though it's a luck-driven game, you could mitigate it with smart play, etc. After dozens of plays, I've found that that's not completely true. It would be more accurate to say that *if* you don't get completely screwed by the luck of the draw, you *might* have an opportunity to turn the tide of the game by smart play. But it turns out that's a bigger "if" than I previously estimated. I've just seen too many games of this now where the winner was the person who got lucky card draws and ended up with a bunch of adjacent lots on one of the large city blocks. Likewise, too many games where the person who came in last drew nothing but backwater lots located on the smaller blocks all game long. The result is that, as with any heavily luck-based game, wins feel hollow, and losses make you feel cheated. Win or lose, you end up feeling like you've just wasted an hour of your time watching the game play itself. Bottom line, if you like that sort of thing, then hey knock yourself out. But it's not for me anymore.

RATING: 8.6
Very fun...with a streamlined ruleset that still captures the intrigue of Vegas.  With land ownership, power grabs in casinos, and the chance to risk investing in land you don't even own, there is always another way to chip away at the leader and improve your own position. The unique scoring track helps prevent a runaway victory, while the luck element creates a Vegas style gambling feel.  Can tell this was released in a very mature, well play tested state.

One of the funnest games in the universe. Do not fall into the trap of thinking this is a luck-based game. Some luck, yes, but there are lots of tactical decisions to be made.

Just like Elvis already sang in the good old days: Viva Las Vegas!! I expected quite something from this title, as I keep a lot of great holiday memories to this insane city, and I was "lucky" to find out it totally lived up to my expectations! It's all about taking risks at the right moment. You never have any control over this game, it's mostly about luck... but then again... it felt exactly the same way back in the time I was playing in The Venetian or in Caesar's Palace! This game is Vegas in a box. Take it or leave it.

Lots of meaningful decisions to nudge the odds your in your favour, and yet the meat of the game revolves around drawing cards and rolling dice!  Perfect fusion of theme into a tactical game that's highly interactive and a heap of fun!
Gambling?  Well yeah, but the "visit another casino" gamble is more of a sideshow that risks helping your opponent.  Casino development and ownership battles are where the real gambling occurs, becoming high-stakes tactical risk management with a dash of optimism - which makes this such a fresh surprise.
Reliably good 2p, but 4p is where it shines.

Love this game.  Seems like a kissing-cousin to Chinatown but the dice, instead of introducing painful randomness, inject some chance into the game to reinforce the Vegas theme.

Raucous gambling fun in this game.  Each player is an owner of casinos.  They want their casinos to get bigger, pay out bigger, have their colored cards show up at the proper time (in Bingo style format), become the boss at other players' casinos, and finally win the game.

With the way the game plays there are HUGE flips of ownerships that can DRASTICALLY change the outcome of a game with the drop of the dice.  You DON'T want to play this game if you are a deeply strategic player.  Your whole empire can easily be taken from you very quickly.  Knowing that, this game really is a hoot.  

If you get into the spirit of flipping ownerships' and gambling, you are in for a good time!

It makes sense that a game this predicated on probability has a Vegas theme. The game reminded me strongly of Monopoly, with the twist that you could pay to roll to potentially take control of a monopoly.

Upping from 5.5. Once I accepted that this is a more fun version of (but still the same vein as) Monopoly (in that for some reason it hits the same notes), I've enjoyed it.

There's the "take-that" style of play that comes from a single card (boo), and then there's the "look me in the eye when you're knifing me" style that comes from a thoughtful scan of the board and a clever play that upends the gameflow going forward (yay).  Lords of Vegas rolls DEEP in the latter.  You simply can never take your position for granted in LoV, and in the end-game some desperate moves can end up paying huge dividends... but you've got to be in the position to do it.

An ideal game about Vegas should feel like 80% strategy, 20% gambling/luck.  And Lords of Vegas absolutely nails it.

Gioco che ricorda Chinatown e Metropolis per la costruizione dei palazzi nei vari appezzamenti lungo la Strip di Las Vegas. Tutti quei dati contenuti nella scatola fanno un po' paura, ma a rendere la partita soggetta all'alea sono soprattutto le carte. Un gioco comunque simpatico con azzardo, dadi e fortuna che proprio non devono mancare al Lord of Vegas.

At the grittier end of the Euro spectrum, this deserves its kudos for shoe-horning a game of craps into the core mechanics. The rest of the game consists of interesting degrees of luck mitigation and quite a lot of adding up. The theme comes through marvellously.

Meh. Lots of dice rolling and random takeovers of others' casinos. The scoring track is kinda cool with its "prerequisites" (casinos must get bigger/more numerous to score anything). Placement has a fair bit of strategy to it. Felt a little too much like Monopoly for me.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (10):[/COLOR]

[i]5 plays might not seem like a lot, but I've only played this with my wife and older kids. That means it has been chosen on our weekly game night once every couple of months, that's pretty good. We all love the negotiation in this game plus the added gambling mechanism. This game has some wild swings, but it's always fun to watch someone bust or hit it big because that next card could be the pay day you're looking for. 

I think this is a must have in a family board game collection, it is easy to learn but the game is all about your interaction with the other players. It's also really hard to constantly play hard ball, because there are always spaces you need on the board that someone has which can lead to a lot of 3 way deals.

I also want to comment on player count, I haven't and won't play with less than 4. The best part of this game is the negotiation and I think you need at least 4 players for that to work well. I also find the game length to be perfect with 4, our games range from 75 to 90 minutes with everyone engaged the whole time. Keeper![/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (9):[/COLOR]

[i]- Great family game, I believe this is the replacement game for Monopoly (at least for my family).
- You only score if your casino card gets flipped the beginning of each turn. This really helps in a family setting because you can have a huge 9 point green casino, but the green cards don't get flipped (this happened to me); meanwhile someone else who has a smaller 6 point purple casino keeps scoring it because purple cards get flipped.
- You know how many of each casino color has been flipped, this becomes important knowledge as you build casinos. However; it is not perfect knowledge because you do not see about a fifth of the cards each game. 
- Trading and negotiation: In this game it is necessary because at the beginning of your turn you get ownership of a random lot. This may be a lot you want, but more than likely it is going to be another player who really wants it. Therefore in order to get lots near each other to build on you will most likely spend lots of time wheeling and dealing. 
- There are ways you can really mess some one over and get ownership of a casino when you only own one of the tiles in that casino.
- The point track: at first you go up one point at a time, but then later in the game you need to have a casino that will score 2, 3, 4... in order to advance on the score track.[/i]

Full disclosure about this rating: I lost the game I played. When I was losing, however, it didn't feel good. There was no sense of "Oh that was a really smart strategy." just "Oh that was a good card that you drew.", or "That was a good roll." 
This is a game where you know what you want to do and what you need to do, but you have to hope you roll well, or draw a card that allows you to do it. If you don't, get ready to watch your opponents surge ahead.

[Thx to Zen for the play.]

LEt´s see. The game as is, isn´t to rate it with a 10. But I put it a 10 because is very addictive. The random factor gives it the flavor of a real game. As filthy rich one turn you can be at the to but in the next one you could be the last. I like that mix between the knowledge of how to play and random. I think that´s a real board game. Because games without random finally all games are one like the other. Every time is the same thing. So I give it a 10. For me the best buy in the last 5 years (since filthy rich).

Acquire but with more luck, and that's not a good thing. The first half of the game is fun. Draw a plot card, get some money, build the start tile of an casino. Each tile gets a pre-set die placed on it. As casinos grow bigger and merge, whoever owns the highest die in the casino gets the points, which happens everytime a plot card is revealed with your casino colour on it. The owner gets 1 point per tile in the casino, whilst everyone in that casino gets cash equal to the amounts on your die. So if you build on a low die plot, you can pay to re-roll and hope for higher. The problem as you enter the mid-game and end-game is, if you've invested in a particular casino or two and the cards simply don't turn up, you're done. You're the sucker at the table. And given a fourth of the deck is not used, odds are that someone's colour is gonna not come up much, and someone's other colour will come out a lot. Nothing you can do. Unless you're playing totally for the ride (and why would you, it's a Euro, not some uber-themed Ameritrash game), someone's coming away with a bitter taste in their mouth. There's a whole trading element thing available which tries to make it engaging and interesting and hide the luck factor, but (and here's the other thing), drawing plot cards with 6's on them are gold, gold, gold. They totally dominate and are worth a ton more than all the other plot cards. So the trade start points are unbalanced as well. I'm going to stick with games that offer everyone a fair shot at enjoying themselves.

Excellent Fun Area-Control/Area-Influence Economic Dice-ish Game !! I absolutely love it !! Strategy can overcome the luck. Game reminds me a little of Airlines Europe.

Not for people who dislike economical games! Can be a slight brain burner and could also go long. Also, can have a runaway leader problem.

If you don't work on your income, you probably won't recover.

A strategy game with a heavy dose of luck. I have played this game twice and in both cases one player had horrible luck early.  In one case, they came back and almost won. in the other, they let the frustration ruin the game and they could not see clear options. 

After 7 plays: this game has become a favorite among our game group, largely due to the unpredictability of the outcomes.

This is such an awesome game!  Sure it's a bit on the random side, but it's Vegas, so you have to expect that.  This game captures the theme of Vegas so well.  Buying up casinos, gambling at other casinos, expanding, etc. etc.  Instead of paper money, I use poker chips, and that so makes the theme all the more rich.

4 plays - A fun game, but obviously very driven by luck. I think this game utilizes luck very well with players having to take some huge, but calculated risks (or gambles!) to win. Obviously, you have to be okay with losing the game on a bad roll etc.

The game starts off slow, with not much to do, but after a few turns, the strategy really starts up as you build, change colors and trade with others to get points. Since you must get points in larger and larger increments as you move up on the scoring track, this mechanic really pushes players to build bigger and take more risks. We all had a blast, but know that luck may cost you your casino at times.

RATING: 7
Fun game, but the payouts and point scoring that occurs after every card is flipped gets a tad cumbersome.  We played with the included paper money, however, and I think poker chips will make this part of the game much more tolerable.  After a single play, you realize how extremely important it is to conserve your dice and use them wisely.  And even more important is keeping in mind that there are only 9 tiles of each color; they run out fast.  Creating large casinos is much trickier than a rules read through might imply.

Plays pretty quick with lots of great moments and tension with the dice rolls.

I am generally annoyed by dice rolling games, but this one works splendidly.

My only complaint is that the endgame is a bit uneventful. Further play may prove this incorrect but the board gets locked up with not a lot of room for any power plays. Most of the excitement is the midgame.

3 player: Never played, but I expect it would be a little wide open.
4-5 player: Ideal. You will need the expansion for 5 though.
6 player: A bit much, even with the expansion. It just gets crowded too fast and expanding upwards becomes too important, which I don't like because it is hard to do early game.

Great game, reasonably quick, never had a bad game of this. Enjoyed by hardcore gamers and casual gamers alike.

Like most games with negotation, I suppose this could bog down if you got players that really wanted to drive a hard bargain, but I haven't seen that. 

I guess it does have a bit of a runaway leader problem... it's rare for everyone to be in this game to the end.

RATING: 5
This rating is preliminary--I'm not entirely convinced that I played the game correctly.  Problem I had was that one player jumped ahead, and then no one could do anything to stop him.  As the game went on, options in the game decreased as the tiles ran out, and players didn't have anything to do with their money, causing the bank to run out multiple times (which was odd).  The last three or four rounds consisted of nothing but mostly-futile attempts to re-roll dice (if successful, they'd just get re-rolled back later).  It's possible that through trading (which no one used) some of the inequities could have been mitigated, but I'm not a huge fan of negotiation.  I'm not sure if I'll get to try this again, but I didn't enjoy it at all.

For what starts out as a random dice placement game (essentially) it soon turns into a ruthless game of hostile takeovers, gambling and excess.

As players spend millions to try and outmanoeuvre their opponents in their own casinos other players try to ruin them from the inside by attempting to beat the house.

In the end scoring is generally tight and more often that not I've found our games getting right down to the wire.

Unsure whether it's worth investing in the UP Expansion though.

I had been looking forward to trying Lords of Vegas for quite some time, and I sorry to say I was quite disappointed. I’m not dismissing the game, but my three-player experience was lackluster for several reasons. First, the randomness to game length ratio seemed high to me. More importantly, however, it was very easy for players to build large casinos without much interaction with others. And once a player is in a casino with a single die and the leader has 4 or more dice, it becomes very difficult to make any progress. Our game never had a casino with all three players involved, and featured just one trade. I have a feeling that playing with more players would dramatically increase my enjoyment of this game and bump it up to a solid beer and pretzels 6.

My first gaming experience with this game was really too frustrating: as I was aiming for just 2 colors (OK, maybe that was not the best strategy after all), but with big casinos, I couldn't afford to lose my purple casino to Wouter.

Lords of Vegas has been criticised for having too much luck, which seems a bit like criticising Agricola for having too many sheep. I really enjoyed the probability management puzzles it poses. It uses its many dice very well, and being able to gamble for the one extra dollar you need is delightful. Definite elements of Acquire, and while it isn't as polished as that timeless classic, it's an interactive, amusing way to spend an hour or so.

9 - I picked this up on sale about a year after watching a play session that didn't quite catch the magic that the game seems to offer up.  It has some very simple ideas, a bingo style property collection, buying themes based on the likelihood of a casino coming up again, and simple trading between players that all come together into a very rich and fun game.  

This game has gotten more plays than many of my other games because it's fairly quick to teach and play and after replacing the paper money with a rack of poker chips it plays way better.  I recently ordered a set of sharp cornered casino dice to serve as the official gamble dice and current player token.  This game very quickly went from a game I picked up on discount hoping it would be good to a rock solid intro game with a dedicated pandora station for when we play.

One 5-player game. It does work as a game but was way too slow for what it is and way too much luck for a 2+ hour game.

Advance to Boardwalk is a simpler, faster, better city building game; and don't even mention this game in the same breath as Acquire.

I don't plan on ever playing again.

A very interesting mix of luck (seems appropriate in a game like this) and solid Euro mechanics. The basic ideas are area control and a little bit of planning ahead, as well as pissing off your competitors. But when it gets down to the dirty stuff, it is all about dice rolling. I can see how some aficionados of balanced gaming and non-random Euro games will get a heart attack playing this but I think this is great fun and usually, the risk pays off, especially when you are playing favourable odds, but as well know, sometimes you get lucky, sometimes you don't and that makes this game more fun than it should be. It looks gorgeous as well and all those many dice and paper money give you a bit of a Vegas feel as well. I enjoyed it a lot !

An approachable game that sets opponents against each other in a race to develop casinos along a section of the Strip in Las Vegas, literally starting from the ground, up. Earn money and victory points as you build casinos in one of several casino franchises.  Spend the money -- it's vegas, after all -- and get a high score to win.

Poker Chips were a handy replacement for the fake paper money, despite the bills having the faces of famous Las Vegas Celebrities from the early days.

I've played this game twice, and in both games I very quickly pulled out into dead last place. Luck of the draw, all to the benefit of people who weren't me. I'm sure I had some suboptimal plays, but I'm not THAT terrible. 

This in itself doesn't have to be a game killer, but I felt like none of my turns were in the least bit meaningful.  Sure, I could try to scrape together some cash and try for a reorg, then hope THAT would pay off at some point... but this isn't a "losing is fun" game. You just have less money and fewer options, and no meaningful chance at a comeback.

I don't necessarily mind "high-luck" games with a little strategy.  But that sort of game should be quick - "OK, so I lost horribly, let's play again and I'll do better," or if it's just a plain bad experience, at least it's a short one.  This sort of game shouldn't last 2+ hours.

This game has a ton of luck involved, but if players are paying attention they should know the stakes before taking chances. The 1st half of the game is a bit of a grind as you slowly build your empire and watch the cards to get an idea of what's more likely to pay out. The last half of the game is an entertaining cutthroat dice-fest as power is constantly snatched away. Overall- A very entertaining romp through Vegas.

Getting income was a problem unless you are lucky with dice.I was hoping this game was Acquire meets Vegas Showdown but it was far short of either of those great games.

Didn't enjoy my first game of this, as i started really well and basically got bashed at every opportunity by everyone else.
The next game, played, begrudgingly, was a bit more fun.
By the time the third game ended, my opinion has changed completely.
Yes, there is an element of luck, BUT, there's more going on than just rolling dice.

Definitely deserves more recognition than its given on BoardGameGeek. It was a huge hit with my game group and immediately  received requests to play again. My only issue is the components could be higher quality, but this is largely mitigated with using poker chips. 

Doesn't play well with two players. If playing with two, shorten the game significantly.

Ahhh...what a fantastic refreshing change from all of the tight resource brain burning euros that I love. This game is just plain fun where money piles up and chance rules the day. There actually IS strategy but when the basic mechanics are card drawing and dice rolling, things can be challenging but man..is this game fun. Lots of laughs and tons of interaction as you build casinos along the strip in Las Vegas. A true treasure of a game that scales well 2-4 and plays in 45-60 mins.

Ok game but don't plan to win because planning doesn't go with this much dice rolling. I've thought a bit more about this game.  I enjoy spree and kill dr lucky. So why don't I enjoy this game?  I think it is because it acts like a game but you can't play it. It is just luck. So are spree and kill dr lucky but they don't pretend to be anything more.  Perhaps in time I'll see what others see in this game but for now ... 

Still not liking this one just one big frustration festival.

Lords of Vegas shines when it's your turn when you've got a fist full of cash and a myriad of choices available to you. It's a blast. What kills it for me is the start of each turn come time to calculate money and points. It really drags the game out and brings the fun momentum to a screeching halt. Also, the components aren't great. The dice aren't weighty and don't feel satisfying to roll. The paper money is fine, but poker chips feel more appropriate. Worst.Insert.Ever.

Played twice, great game, have never had so long a patch of bad luck in my life.  In spite of that I enjoyed this very much.  

This is a game where personalities can come into the mix, where you can cut a deal in pretty much any way you like (and that could be very important for victory) and where you can take a swing at luck and create opportunities for yourself that get you back into the game when you're beaten down.  I'll be honest, I've played twice and gotten horrible rolls and bad positioning, but in spite of that I enjoyed both plays.  The open-field play, the non-restrictive ruleset, the play-the-odds nature of the card draw puts this critter in all the right categories for me personally.

When you get tired of bone-dry Stefan Feld games where the rules play you give this one a spin and enjoy the freedom of action it provides.  Fair warning -- that freedom brings adversity as well as opportunity.  You need to fight off the bad and capitalize on the good to win this game.  That's good gaming.

This game really hits its stride with a group of outgoing, competitive players who are interested in making deals, taking huge (calculated) risks, and going for the throat when the opportunity presents itself.

Luck based, but in such a way that it glorifies in it, rather than using it. This game explores many different kinds of luck-based mechanics, so that by the end, it's impossible to detail who won more by luck, and only who used their skill more effectively.

Thematically, the game smacks of vegas, but still manage to pull off a fair representation of power struggle and property development.

RATING: 7
Visual Appeal: (4)
The game is as colorful as one would hope to see from a game about Las Vegas. The designs of each casino help the imagination, though they don't mean much thematically. Dice are contrasty and easy to see, though in low light, the blue and green components are hard to tell apart.

Components: (2)
I am a bit disappointed with a few things here. The money is poor quality. It's very thin paper which is easily bent or torn. The game designers missed out on a perfect opportunity to use casino chips, and I intend to make the upgrade myself once I fix the second issue. The box itself has a nonsensical insert that appears to have been designed for a completely different game. Nothing fits anywhere and bits are always clunking around and messy when I open the box.

Theme: (5)
Who wouldn't want to be a rich Vegas casino mogul? This game lets you spend millions of dollars recklessly gambling each turn to make good on your investments. There's stealing, there's gambling and more stealing. All of it just pulls players in deeper to the high stakes world of The Strip.

Learning: (4)
Player aids make the game move smoothly with minimal rules referencing on the first play. I have not had any player misunderstand a major rule. It takes a few plays to understand the odds and optimal times to push your luck, but with a game so heavily reliant on gambling, sometimes you just need to take risks without understanding every possible outcome.

Gameplay: (3)
There is a LOT of luck in this game, but that is granted due to it's apparent theme. Some of it is mitigated. You get money for owned plots even if you don't risk building casinos. Casinos are worth a LOT more though, so luck will definitely win that battle. You can diversify your casinos to a degree. Although, to progress to higher point totals, you need to consolidate to fewer colors which is risky and requires luck to pay off. The worst offender is the random lot gains each turn. Sometimes, you just get awful lot placement and thus a poor shot at a good income. Player interaction is rich though with everyone trying to take control of casinos and re-position themselves at the right time.

Overall Fun: (4)
This game is massively fun when playing with people who can look past the luck and take things as they come. The people who have the most fun with this game aren't engine-builders, they're explorers. Failing repeatedly while your friends laugh at your misfortune would be souring except that those tables will turn and you will laugh at them soon enough. Or you could just re-roll all of their dice and steal their income. Open mindedness toward the back-stabby swing-y nature of the game is key.

This game feels like an improved version of [i][url=http://www.juegosdemesacr.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=258&Itemid=1]Chinatown[/url][/i], with some luck added to the mix just for the fun of it. Then again, players try to get real state property in order improve their chances to win money and get victory points, especially by acquiring lots next to others that they control. By the way, the scoring track mechanic to avoid a runaway problem is very clever and works extremely well. Very tense and emotive, this is just the best economic negotiation game that I've tried so far, light years of distance from [i][url=http://www.juegosdemesacr.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=32&Itemid=1]Traders of Genoa[/url][/i] and the said [i][url=http://www.juegosdemesacr.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=258&Itemid=1]Chinatown[/url][/i], and even better than the great [i][url=http://www.juegosdemesacr.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=48&Itemid=1]Bohnanza[/url][/i].

This may be one of the best themed games I own.  Not because the components are amazing, but every aspect of this game has a gambling/Vegas type feel to it.  Building casinos, randomly getting new lots via lottery, taking over areas that you might lose later on, rolling dice for control of a casino, gambling with other players...  The scoring mechanism of needing to score 2 then 3 then 4 and so on points to move up is really nice in this game to prevent runaway leaders, thus making the luck factor throughout balance out.  Really well done.

Dice? Randomness? Luck? Normally, I would say "nope." 

But this one really fits well. I think because it captures Vegas so well. I easily get the feel for the luck and risk that people experience when gambling. The reorganization and remodeling and sprawling actions give more freedom and choices. And the way the scoring works is especially interesting and makes the game really tight. Lords of Vegas is good.

Looked forward to this game with much anticipation since seeing a demo at KublaCon. There are some aspects I think are BRILLIANT mechanically. Finally played at RinCon10, and was a bit disappointed. 

There are important choices to make and interesting decisions, but your basis for those decisions is really not very knowable or calculable (though you have some probability on your side). In the end, I don't think it's my kind of game, but I'd try it again.

Stuff that sucks when it happens in Lords of Vegas:
Clever, well thought out, expensive ply that combines  reorganizing (twice because the first re-roll wasn't fruitful), remodeling and sprawling and takes 2 or 3 turns to set up (extra because of the afore mentioned bad reroll, a 1 turning into a 2)... completely undone when the next player draws a location next to that casino, and builds it, taking control of the casino, and then it scores on my next turn. Couldn't see it coming, completely unlikely, and nothing at all I can do about it or to protect against it.

Near end of game, building a size 3 casino on adjacent sections - I can choose Green or Purple. Both show the same number of cards. So I choose Green (picked at random). Cards left in deck: Purple, then Game End, then Green. What's the difference? Just the outcome of the game.

This game is definitely a beer-and-pretzel type of game.  It's great fun to watch someone's casino get taken over after they've spent a great deal of time building it up.  The fact that only 3/4 of the deck is used makes for some variety as well as a gambling aspect that you would only expect from a game like this.  Very fun and a welcome addition to my collection.

I was introduced to this game as a trading, which I suppose is technically correct.  There was some trading involved, but it was really limited.  My might have been an effect of inexperience.  Still, there was nothing even close to the level of trading present in Chinatown, Traders of Genoa, or Bohnanza.  This was in part due to the limited availability of property in the game.

Another problem I had was the extreme level of chaos in the game.  Much of the money needed for the game depends on certain cards being turned up.  If the chains you are involved in don't come up (or come up at inopportune times), you are in trouble.  In addition, it seems as if too much of the game can hinge on a single (un)lucky die roll.

I do like the ability to take over spaces.  Unfortunately, it has a double penalty.  It is expensive to do money-wise followed by risk of losing the property later.  I also really like the way the scoring is done.  The graduated system that is used forces players to make interesting decisions on how they want to pursue victory.  You must find a way to score bigger points or the system will limit your position.  [07/08/2012]

This game. Wow! Such a blast! If being an ultra competitive Las Vegas casino tycoon is at all appealing to you, this is a must try. This game lives up to that theme so well with intensity that will grip you the whole game even when it's not your turn. Seriously, go pee before you start, because you will not be able to tear yourself away from the table once the action starts. You may not be friends at the end of the game, but all of you will have had a good time.

EDIT: Not as much fun at two players, unfortunately.

Played once with 3P. Lords of Vegas is a game of probabilities - whether it's earning a little cash through gambling or choosing which casino to invest in, players have to surrender a lot of control to the whims of luck. And yet there is a thrill in negotiating the trading of lots, or when a gamble pays off. The scoring track is a brilliant mechanism as it forces players to gradually expand their casinos, making the Sprawl action more valuable as the game progresses. One drawback for me is that the game does take a rather long time for its weight, and counting the pips during the money payout late in the game can be quite a chore.

Looks like a complicated area control game with all of the components but it's much easier than it looks. I enjoy this game although the only "flaw" is the reorganizing action towards the end game. This  generally becomes the main focus where players end up depleting their cash reserves to repeatedly re-roll all the dice in the largest casinos in the hopes of controlling them as the boss (and scoring last minute VP's). Even so, it's still a fun game with a great theme,lots of risk taking and dice chucking.

The basic mechanics are quite simple, but figuring out a good strategy is quite challenging.

Just like Vegas, you can put a lot to chance in this game and end up empty-handed for the most part, but it's quite exhilarating when it works out!  Can't say I've played anything like it before!

I'm not a gambler, but I like gambling, if you get my meaning. Lords of Vegas captures what I like about it, namely, probability management and the excitement of risk-taking. The scoring system is clever, both slowing runaway leaders and motivating deal-making. The components are great once you replace the paper money with poker chips. 

The only negative, in my view, is that the game is a bit long, but that could be remedied by taking out a few cards. The trouble is, removing cards exacerbates luck of the draw, and there might be an otherwise unhealthy helping of luck as is. But I always enjoy playing, even when the dice and card draws seem allied against me, and even when it goes on longer than it should. In that way, and in others, it's like Acquire. Just don't take the game too seriously.

Tentative rating that could move either way.  Has some fun moments, especially gambling in your opponent's casino. I'm generally a fan of dice games and some randomness, but here it doesn't quite seem to work.

Then again, I love playing Risk, so what do I know?

This game reminds me quite a bit of Acquire but I didn't really care for Acquire and I do enjoy this game quite a bit.

The game is simple to teach and play but there are a lot of interesting decisions to make.  I felt like even if you fall behind, because of the actions at your disposal, your ability to shake up the control of casinos, and the scoring mechanic that forces you to achieve higher and higher point totals at one time to move up on the track, you can always work your way back into the game.

The game is very colorful as well which keeps it from feeling too terribly dry.

Love this game.
I used to think I didn't like games with too much luck until I realized that randomness - it's actually kinda fun. Especially when the theme JUST FITS. 

To think I thought I didn't like dice either. 

After playing this, with the amount of fun I had, Lords of Vegas is probably in my Top 5 list of all time. Heck, it may even be in my Top 3. Having just played 2-player games of this twice where I lost and lost cos of luck. (I dont really play games that often sadly. I cancel board game sessions much more often than having them.)

Spent a lot of time thinking why I enjoyed this so much more than Cosmic Encounter which is much more highly regarded. I think the mechanism of this allows the fun to just come naturally while Cosmic really relies on the strength and camaraderie of the group to make it fun. LoV is simply, IMHO, a better conduit for generating fun for groups that don't interact as often or as well.

Oh my god. This game! Such a luck fest but I just adore this game. It's so fun to me. Because it is a luck fest in a number of ways it's fun to just try and gamble all your money and see if you can bankrupt somebody before their turn or to just buy up property you don't have the rights to and try and build an empire and see if it tumbles down around you. Fun fun fun.

A curates egg of a game. 'Lords of Chaos' might be appropriate at first sight, but underneath is an intriguing game of probability management, aggressive stock moves and positioning.

I think its easy to overlook the trade aspect of the game, in a 3 or 4 player game it can help get players better sites.

The game encourages and, t o some extent, rewards outrageoeusly aggressive behaviour - which goes with the theme.

Lords of Vegas has been our latest "rage" game (what I call those games that completely take over all other games for a certain amount of time and that I lay in bed devising new strategies to play better next time). It is an incredibly dynamic game of strategy, mind-games, muscle-flexing, scheming, and of course, luck! The uber-conservative will not win nor will the extremely aggressive. You need to find the right balance of each (which changes each game depending on who you play with and how the game plays out!) to pull off the elusive win.  

The turn mechanics are very simple: Take over a new lot. Get paid by vacant lots you own. Get paid by casinos. Get points by being the boss. Take your actions. Done. Clean and simple, just how I like it. The money grossed is used to take one of four actions: 1. Building on a lot you own, 2. Sprawling onto a lot you don't own, 3. Remodeling (meaning changing the color of your casino), and 4. Reorganizing (meaning mixing up a casino's power structure!). Remodeling and reorganizing cause some very tense, even heated moments as you vie for control of ever-expanding casinos. I've bruised my fist many a time slamming it on the table when my hard-earned investment goes right out the window. But just as many times I've pumped my fist when a well-devised risk pays off massive dividends! 

I am a reward-sensitive person, essentially meaning that my genes make me love the thrill of high risk/high return! This game is that outlet for me. There is a high risk/reward component that is a blast. Manage it well (as you would in Vegas!) and you'll find yourself at the top of the food chain. Mismanage the risk/reward paradox and you'll crash hard. Have an extra risk/reward itch to scratch? Once per turn, you can also straight up gamble at another boss's casino! 

Favorite moment: when I own a single, hapless tile in a large casino and the two leaders are in a heated battle to become boss. One of them pays a fortune to reorg and guess who the lucky new boss is? Me! Hahahaha! 

Most frustrating moment: when I'm one of the two leaders in the situation above.  

The Up! expansion takes Lords of Vegas to a whole new level...literally. Instead of playing on just a flat plane, you build your casinos vertically to increase their returns, make them more difficult to be taken over, and paint a bigger target on your back! This expansion also allows for 6 players instead of 4. 

Overall, this game is so much fun. It's relatively quick, simple in construct, has an incredibly high replay value, has a fantastic balance of strategy and luck, is completely consuming...and has an awesome game board with chips, dice, and cards! Tell me, what more could you ask for? I give it an extremely high 9 out of 10.

Works quite well with 2P. People who enjoy Monopoly but want something more advanced and fun should try this. HOWEVER, I wouldn't advise using this on someone who hasn't played any modern games. They will be out of their depth as there is a fair bit of info to digest upon first play.

This is not a great game by any means, but for a game where a random draw determines which square on the board grid you're going to get to claim and then dice rolls for random determinations of various possibilities, it's quite nicely designed and balanced.  It's not as complex as I'd hoped from the rules set, but it does have some built-in rollick.

Gosh, alot of randomness for a game that lasted two hours. I ended up winning after someone else reorganized a hotel that I ended up taking over. That's kind of weird. Another opponent needed a last minute gamble to pay off which would have made him the winner. If he wins that I lose. He didn't. I won. This is after two hours. But, as stated, my real boost came in the form of a takeover initiated by an opponent. I got real lucky and ended up taking over a hotel that I never had any designs on.

Furthermore, the game has ALOT going on. Scoring and payouts that happen at the beginning of EACH TURN are quite fiddly. Often we would forget payouts for vacant lots or even whose turn it was because the money and points are flying every which way.

And in the end, after this cacophony of chaos and fiddliness, a winner rises from the dust. I won't say there weren't some moments of fun, but when all was said and done, it was kinda pointless.

Fun game that bears only scant in common with Vegas Showdown. Finding the clever plays seems to be the key here, as well as imaginative ways to hang on to the higher paying Casinos when they are at their most useful. Clever design, attractive artwork and good components, but poker chips would have been so much better than paper money.

The game starts of so slow I was really worried about it being boring.  However, it quickly accelerates into a really fun mix between a dice game and Acquire.

At first glance, this is game looks like it would very luck driven.  Sure there is some luck in how the cards come up or which card never come up before the game ends. Also when you re-role the dice there is luck.  But there is a lot of important choices which to me is much more important for winning then the luck.  I lost a lot of early bets but that in no way put me out of the game.  This is one of the games where as soon as we were done I wish we had time to play this again.  Because of the options in the game I believe there are many ways to win this game.  I want to try all the ideas that are floating in my head.

A lot deeper strategically than it looks and with a decent amount of risk/gambling thrown in for theme and to keep the game ticking over.

LoV suffers from end-game stagnation (where you have plenty of money but no choices to make), so you end up hording your money to use as a tie-braker.  Other than that, it's an amazing game.  Almost every turn provides an agonizing (in a good way) choice to make, and you real feel like your gambling everything (without losing any real money).

The best part for me was the extraordinary ways casinos get taken over. Lots of fun and laughter whenever that happens. Anyway, last night's game was laid to rest any fears I had about keeping this game in the collection. I think it's similar to games like Settlers, so it's got a place.

And it certainly evoked the spirit of Vegas.

Admittedly, I came into this game with the wrong attitude. I thought it would be a more strategic game about building casinos on the strip. Instead, it's a light gambling-inspired game with lots of dice rolling. You do have to be able to calculate odds, but those odds can swing wildly. There is also some room for clever tactics towards the endgame. Overall, though, I felt as if the game left too much to the dice and cards while pretending to be about proper planning. If I played this game with expectations similar to Long Shot, perhaps I'd enjoy it more.

Always welcome at the table (Usually 3P).

While chance influences every aspect of the game, skill is the dominating factor; knowing where, and when to build, and with whom to trade, gamble, and attack are the keys to winning reliably.

The mechanics & theme of the game are a perfect match.

Money is clearly the worst component.... but tbh I don't mind it too much.
Poker chips are an obvious alternative, but I suspect they'd become unwieldy towards the end of the game.

:edit:

Finally played a game with 4, and wow, it's a very different game; much more random, and a little less enjoyable as a result.

I think 3P is the sweet spot.

Why bother with two hours of thoughtful planning when life is a crap shoot anyway?  Lords of Vegas is an intriguing game of influence that comes apart as the dice escalate in their relative inpact.  Complex payouts each turn are also a busywork hassle and the glitzy board makes it hard to see the critical dice pips.  But gameplay couldn't be better married to theme and in that way, Lords of Vegas is a natural.

Very much luck involved but also allows interesting action chains. Risk management and a good tracking of possible actions and costs are essential. Make a plan, collect the necessary money by gambling and consider what you do if you lose your bet. It may be that it is a little bit unforgiving: If you have a bad distribution of small casinos, it will be very difficult to score late in the game. 

Great mix of strategy and luck, highly thematic.

A fantastic game where lucky die rolls can win the game. Of course, strategy can mitigate the dice rolls to some extent, but overall lives up to the Las Vegas theme. It's a game that can lead to AP, but I think succeeds best when turns are taking quickly.

Dirty backstabbing and greasy deals makes this game shine.  It is rare that a game's theme really makes you feel like your in the game but this absolutely does and does well.  Mechanics are rock solid and I would say this game is a mix of Catan and Monopoly.  That may be a stretch but I see a connection to both games.  I believe this game doesn't get the credit it deserves.

Full disclosure: I do not trade when I play this. Negotiation games can get so lost in a quagmire of dickering that the game drags far past it's expiration date. Yeah, Bootleggers you are a problem, but not the only one.

Now, read everything else I write with that understanding. Maybe I should negotiate, but it does scare me.

The first two plays of this were quite good. There were 4 of us and it was fun speculating on the next casinos to come, renovations were sometimes surprising and exciting. Gambling in an opponents casino was especially raucous.

The had all the wacky tension that dice often provide as well as a fun bit of speculation and empire building. 

But a problem started creeping in. It felt like in two subsequent games I noticed a lot of the endgame came down to rolling dice for renovation. The winner came down to getting lucky on the last turn or two. It soured me. I'll admit that part of it was a particularly demoralizing game of two horrible rolls and an opponents improbable final roll. But both games were won that way and it was unsatisfying and unsettling. 

I have been hesitant to bring it out since. 

Sour grapes or a slight flaw? I won't know until I play it some more.

On another note, Mayfair, who normally makes the ugliest of ugly games, actually made a great looking one here. Yet they couldn't quite get it all right. the box cover is terrible. It's kind of a bad layout, but the picture itself is just stupid. Why did they choose these people to represent the building of Vegas and what exactly is going on. I think I know, but even then it is still stupid.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 2
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3


Overall - 1

Lords of Vegas is a game about building casinos in Las Vegas. Every turn you draw a card that determines both the space on the board where the current player gets a new permit to build, but also which color casinos will pay out points and money. You get a buck for every unbuilt property you own, and the pip values of the casinos you own in the color that's paying out (pip values are initially set by the space but can change during the game). Additionally, you get points equal to the number of tiles in a casino you control of the appropriate color. Control of a casino is decided by the highest value (there can never be a tie, if there is you roll off until there isn't a tie anymore). As scores go up, the scoretrack starts skipping numbers, going up by two, then three and so on. If your casino scores a single point and the next value is two higher, you can't take the point. So in the late game you want to have larger casinos.

Some spaces on the board are better than others, namely the spots of the strip, as there are four cards that will trigger a strip payout, and there is a final end of game strip payout. But better spots usually cost a lot more to develop.

On your turn you pay to develop an unbuilt property into a casino, gamble at an opponent's casino, remodel (i.e. change the color of your casino), reorganize (i.e. reroll all the dice in the casino... which hopefully changes the control), or sprawl (i.e. pay double to develop in an adjacent spot).

Gambling didn't seem so great... if you win you take money from the opponent, but if you lose he takes yours. The odds favor the house slightly, and players seem rarely to win. Remodeling and reorganizing are a large part of the game, as they're ways to wrest control from other players.

For example, if there's a large yellow casino, you might build an adjacent brown casino with a one pip value, then reorganize and reroll a six pip value, then remodel the casino to yellow and take control of it. As casinos get bigger it costs more and more to remodel/reorganize them, so they tend to become more stable... but if you have a lot of money you can still make a big power play. Having more of the casino tiles in a casino tends to make you safer as you're more likely to get at least one good die roll if all the dice are rerolled in a reorg.

One interesting aspect of the game is that almost anything can be traded at any time. The wheeling and dealing aspect of the game was a large factor in our game and seems to be a critical aspect of the fun. If players refuse to trade, I think a lot would be lost in the game.

This game has luck. While there's certainly some strategy at play in the game, it's got a lot of random too. The game flat out has gambling in it after all... but that actually isn't really a big source of the randomness. A lucky reorg roll at the right time can have a fairly huge impact. As can the right casino color paying out at the right time. If you go into the game knowing that there is a lot of randomness, then I think it can be a lot of fun. I enjoyed my play, but I think that I might have a problem with playing this too often... especially if players end up getting really hosed by luck. Everything pretty much balanced out in our play. The casino colors that were most likely to pop up came up at roughly the probability you'd expect and reorg rolls tended to favor the player with the most dice involved, etc.

With two players, this game fell a bit flat with me. It just looks so much interesting than I felt it really was. There is a lot of randomness in it, and I feel like the luck cannot be sufficiently managed. Do not get me wrong: I like randomness in games like Diamant or Airships for example, it is just that Lords of Vegas is a bit too long for the randomness it offers. Also, I like the similarly themed Vegas Showdown better. Nevertheless, I would like to play the game with four before I reach my final verdict.
UPDATE: Finally got the chance to play this with four, and with that number of players the game really shines as long as it is played quickly. With four, the randomness creates lots of drama and suspense. Raised my rating from 6.5 to 7.5. Original enough to stay in my collection.

A decent game which incorporate dice into a casino game without making it too luck based. No new mechanics here for game play. It is essentially an area-control game with area control easily changing hands between different players based on a die roll. That is likely the most interesting and most luck-based mechanic of the game. In the game I played and won, I had control of only one tile in an 8-tile casino, yet wrestled control of the casino and scored a bunch of points in that round. Those points eventually became a game-winning round for me. Another interesting aspect of the game is the scoring track - instead of a linear track, one needs to get a certain amount of points before you can move ahead on the scoring track. This gets progressively harder over time as the amount of point needed to move one step becomes higher. Interesting mechanic to force a different point accumulation strategy. Game is relatively light and I find your options overall to be not as diverse and limited near the end game except rolling dice and trying to gain control of casinos.

Update 1/31/2017:

I realized I haven't updated this comment since the first time I played, and have had a few more since then. I REALLY DISLIKE this design, and feel like I'm in the minority. The game is random and chaotic and entirely too lucky for how long and intricate it is. 

The thing that gets me is that, since these facets are nothing if not deeply thematic, lots of people seem to enjoy riding that whirlwind wherever it takes them (hint: often times this means into the ground).

While I certainly enjoy riding dice randomness from time to time (I'm a big fan of the dice-chucker Las Vegas even if it falls flat at higher player counts), the combination of "look at all the stuff you can do on your turn [to potentially mitigate luck, except not really]" present in Lords of Vegas really grinds my gears.

If the game wasn't themed around gambling, I can guarantee that it would be rated a lot lower.

There are very few thematic games that really create an emotion.  Far too often, slathered on chrome is passed off as theme.  Games that create emotions that relate directly to their theme are in fact rare.  I'm thinking BSG, The Resistance, and Long Shot.  All of these games create emotions directly linked to their theme.  Paranoia in the case of BSG and The Resistance, excitement of a horse race in Long Shot.

I can now add another game to that list.  Lords of Vegas has a huge dash of luck, but it's a game that demands it.  If skill was all that was required to win in Vegas there would be no Vegas.  It's about gambling.  And that's a part of Lords of Vegas. 

In the games I've played so far strategy and tactics are definitely rewarded.  What Lords does is put that all in jeopardy by allowing other players to take down the better player with a roll of the dice at a key moment.  

Lords does start off kind of slow, but once it gets going and people get into the theme of taking chances this can be exciting. It's a strategic push your luck game.  Totally fits the theme.

The only reason I don't give it a perfect 10 is because it doesn't play as well with 2.  Otherwise, it's a 10 for what it is.

This was one of the surprise hits of Origins for me. It turns out that being a casino mogul is a blast, and the elements of paying to remodel and reroll casinos and gambling combine excellently. The mechanism of requiring an increasing number of points to be scored in order to progress to the next space on the score track is brilliant and really provides the extra boost the game needed to really shine. I can't wait to play this one again.

Meh. Fun, but too much luck! Yes, there should be luck in this game, and I even appreciate it, but... The random lot assignment is the worst. You can get a lot that gives you the upper hand in a big-scoring block, or one that is irrelevant. You can get screwed if you sprawl early and then the lot is drawn and lost. Clever scoring track.

I thought I was going to love this. I love Acquire. I love Chinatown, both of which LoV is getting compared to frequently. But I don't love Monopoly, and while it might sound odd, Lords of Vegas is as close to a Monopoly variant as a modern game can be.

In Monopoly, victory points (in Monopoly, obviously just cash) are doled out according to dice rolls. More specifically, in Monopoly you tip the odds of these payout dice rolls by assembling a block of units  for quantity and proximity. How do you assemble these blocks and build proximity? A combination of pure unmitigated luck and negotiation.

Lords of Vegas? Pretty much the same thing: victory points are doled out according to dice rolls that are (**theoretically) tipped in your favor by assembling quantity/proximity of units. How do you assemble these units? A combination of pure unmitigated luck and negotiation.(**There are so few rolls in LoV compared to Monopoly that odds here don't really 'even out', so Monopoly-- with its higher number of dice rolls-- gets the nod here when comparing which game has more skill.) 

Really, if you mashed up Monopoly so it all took place on a grid instead of a circle and you added some thematic chrome (for example: the just-about-useless gambling mechanic) you'd have Lords of Vegas. 

If the game is up for grabs for anyone who gets a lucky dice roll, then why don't we just play Monopoly and see who lands on Boardwalk and Park Place?

There are other mechanics that also make the luck factor cross into the absurd. Payouts happen according to what cards get drawn. Yes, you can estimate how many of each type are left in the deck, but because you have no information about the timing of such payouts or even what is in the last-- unused-- part of the deck, planning is impossible.

This game is getting a lot of love, and I think that is great. When a game gives people joy that makes me happy even if I don't like the game myself. But my more cynical side thinks that this suggests that you can get away with anything in terms of game mechanics if you have wonderful theme integration. And what more perfect way to excuse a game that is based as much on luck as Monoply or Yatzee than have the theme be Vegas? While it is probably true that a lot of dice in a game turn me into an curmudgeon, this game's dice are especially atrocious for people who aren't fans of such things.

I do like risk assessment and risk management. There are games I love where you have to decide how much you'll risk based on the probabilities of payouts. (I'll play Manilla anytime, anyplace.) But I'd say this games is not one of those despite the suggestion in many places on BGG that it is.

My first game was a total bust because no one made any big moves, were scared to pay to roll dice and there was zero negotiation.  If everyone is scared of risk, this game is nothing more than drawing a card and hoping you win.

My second game was a thoroughly entertaining gaming experience where everyone was throwing caution to the wind, emphatically taking risks on everything playing into the theme as it was mean to be.  Gambling at each others casino's, trading plots, taking and retaking casino's just in time for the strip card to show up, loads of fun!

The "Up" expansion is really necessary to add a very fun, additional layer of strategy where people can build upwards to avoid running into each other, or swap out tiles and then building up to steal a casino.  Really elevated the game for me, just the little bit of extra depth of strategy the game needed.

I can't fathom how this game is rated as high as it is.  You can pick the best strategy and cut the best deals, and still finish dead last.

Which lots you get each turn is a random card draw, which also determines which color of casino's pay out and score VP.

When you build on a lot, you set the die to what is printed on the board, and pick which color you want the casino to be.  If an adjacent lot is the same color, they are all part of the same casino, with the boss being the die with the highest value.

When the casino pays out, each player gets the die value in dollars, and the boss gets all the VP for the casino. (vp is total number of lots in the casino)

As one action, you can pay the total of all the dice in the casino to reroll them all.  This can establish a new boss and new values for payouts.  Having more dice in the casino increase your odds of having the top value, but can't overcome bad luck.  So if you have 4 buildings and another player has 1, they can still be the boss, just by having the higher die value.

Casinos on the strip can also score when the strip cards come out, and they have the higher starting values in the game.  So the people that get these lots in the random draw have an advantage.

The game is way to random for the length.  Given the same amount of time, play Poker or Blackjack instead.  They'll give more of a Vegas feel than this crappy game.

RATING: 6.5
Dicey area-control game, where you expand casinos based on which cards are drawn, and strategic use of various actions such as changing casino colours, re-rolling dice to see who the leader is. Ultimately, points go to the person who has control of a casino when a matching colour is drawn from the deck.

Fun game, plays really quickly. I particularly liked the scoring system, where you need a certain amount of points to advance on the score track (IE, the track goes from 10 straight to 12, so you need to get 2 points to advance. Getting one point twice simultaneously isn't enough, and you would stay at 10). This forces you to grow and earn more points at once, and it escalates upwards to 3,4,5 points needed as the game goes on.

If Las Vegas did not exist, you would have to invent it. It's 1950 and you're a real estate developer in a struggling desert town in undeveloped southern Nevada. Millions of wealthy tourists from nearby Los Angeles might be willing to drive here on their vacations, spending billions of their hard-earned dollars, if only you produced something. But your town has nothing to offer but sand, hot weather, and the world's most unsophisticated gambling laws. Your brilliant plan? Erect a forest of casinos and sell the tourists absolutely nothing.

Lords of Vegas is just pure stupid fun. Thematically, it doesn't simulate any particular facet of Las Vegas. Superficially, it's about building casinos on the strip. This isn't really an economic or resource management sim, however...it's more like a cross between Aquire and Chinatown, which is a pretty good lineage to have. That being said, instead of pure strategy, Lords of Vegas is chock full of random die rolling. This isn't a bad thing, as there are plenty of ways to buy even more die rolls, so over the course of a game you can buy your way out of bad dice, which is really what drives the game.

There are also a lot of clever things in the game that make it memorable. For instance, you can gamble at your opponent's casinos. A quick game of craps and you can walk out with a whole lot of your opponent's money that he didn't want to give you. Alternatively...you may just be financing their next hostile takeover. Another cool thing is the Victory Point barriers. The game pushes you to form mergers and interact with your opponents by slowly phasing small casinos out of the game. Unlike most games, you can't combine your points from different sources into a single scoring opportunity. If your casino scores you two points, but you are at a three point barrier, those points are simply lost. You must expand your little casinos into bigger holdings.

It's one James Earnest's best designs...I'm glad it made it into a big nice production instead of a Cheapass package.

Area control.
It's actually hard to pin this one down but anyway you're building casinos on the Vegas strip and it's awesome.
Medium weight.
Medium-high player interaction.
Medium theme application.

Every game we've played of this has been an absolute riot. It mechanises really easily, and once people get a handle of expanding their casinos, hostile takeovers and among other things, gambling, it really picks up pace with players getting right into the theme.

A almost totally unique experience - perhaps older games like Acquire have similar expansion, takeover and share mechanics but they lack the charm and snap of the Vegas theme which elevates this above the rest.

I had an elitist bent against Table Top, I was above it and everything that it stood for. In addiiton, the few episodes I watched were awful (namely the Formula D one, everyone was trying far too hard to be funny and everyone failed). However, I run a meetup group and more and more folks are coming in saying that Table Top got them (back) into board games, so I decided I'd watch a few of the episodes to see what I was missing. One of those episodes featured Lords of Vegas.

It hit me at a perfect point because I was on the lookout for simple games that played well at multiple player counts and could be taught to new gamers in a short amount of time. Lords of Vegas fit that bill to a T and I decided to buy it.

I've only played it once, but I really do enjoy this game and can see it becoming a hit with my family. It's simple, has some luck, strategy, and negotiation. It lets you freewheel, but it's not too powerful. Good players can apply strategy, but luck can save you from some bad decisions. In addition, I really like most of the components (paper money excluded). I'll definitely keep it around and bring it out for family if not other gamers as well.

Competitive dice-based city builder in a bustling Nevada City. Start with dice rolled city lots. Get money from dice rolled payouts on your lots. Invest that money on Casino tiles. Premium spaces are on the strip. Each turn you can build, sprawl, remodel or reorg as much as you can afford and gamble once. Reorg is a cool way to try to take away the boss position in a Casino.  Lady luck plays a big part of success.  The challenge is fighting back and forth to build big casinos to get the big payouts.  The increments on the score track is a clever mechanic to slow down runaway leaders.

An entertaining foray into Las Vegas moguldom.  The game created a very positive first impression, which was likely enhanced by my ruthless crushing of the competition.

Unfortunately, I can see how 1-2 players might consistently gain an early lead and never look back.  But I can also imagine how losing players might mercilessly gang up on the leader(s) by funneling/trading mountains of cash to the other non-winning players.  So, as long as everyone cooperates, true cosmic balance may be possible.

Side comment: I'm in agreement with everyone else about the tedious lot payouts.  My suggestion would be to sprinkle multiple piles of 1's around the board and let players take their own payments.

[i]Update[/i]:

Lot placement is important, but it's totally random. The game is still fun, but this one aspect can be quite problematic.

In hindsight, this might be a playstyle problem rather than a mechanical problem. We should probably be trading or selling lots more frequently than we do.

RATING: 6.9
A pretty good game. Should play quickly once everyone knows how the game goes. A player taking multiple actions may use up a little time, but not much. your turn comes around relatively quickly unless you have a friend with AP. 

Some say this is a mean game. I do not think it is mean. I will say that it is business in Vegas, so it can be ruthless especially if you are crafty with your reorganization and remodeling. Do not play it with people who are immature or thin skinned especially if they will take deals and takeovers that do not go their way personally.  Negotiating is encouraged, but getting someone to agree is the trick and so they are somewhat hard to forge. 

The biggest actions taken when I have played were building, remodeling and reorganizing. Reorganizing become more expensive as the game goes on. Remodeling can be a tricky way to take over another casino. 

Sprawling and gambling are possible too, but these actions are less common. Sprawling is risky, but is less risky as the game goes on and you are near the end of the game. Gambling is questionable. There does not seem to be a lack of money except in the beginning, so it is likely best to gamble then. Later in the game It could be a strategy to try to drain an opponent of their cash.

It is a medium weight game, I do not see it as a super in-depth game, because it lacks long term strategic decisions owing to the fact that the game swings back and forth. As your casinos grow your positioning and control on the board becomes important especially when you need to score 4 or 5 point tiles to move up the victory point track, 

The game should be played fun and fast like Vegas. I do not own the expansion which I would like to get, so I wonder how it might change the dynamics of the game. It would definitely be nice to add a 5th player. This is why I currently give it a 6.9.  It is fun if it is played fast and you accept the fact that like the roulette wheel things may not go your way.

And the ability to make high risk/ reward decisions (gambling at an opponent's casino to try and get that extra money you need to sprawl your casino into a space adjacent to that same opponent's huge casino and then to remodel your casino into the same brand casino leading to a showdown between your casino boss and their casino boss which you will hopefully win and thereby take control of this new monster casino... only to have that casino's card come up only once more in the entire game.  I mean seriously, what are the odds of so many Pioneer Casino cards being left out of the game.  Ridiculous!)

Absolutely love this game. Great Concept, plays pretty fast. Awesome with 4 people. 

It just never hits the table. I do enjoy the game, but I would rather it got to a new home to be played.

Much lighter than I expected. We played a rule wrong allowing multiple reorganizations per turn which kind of screwed things up. I think the game would be a lot better playing that as intended, since we had multiple attempts in most turns towards the end of the game. Still an enjoyable game if you like chucking dice, shame it's really only playable at 4.

Theme fits here really well. I like building up and taking over casinos. Maybe the speed bumps on the score track are a little too severe? Then allow a bit too much catch up so that everyone tends to end up in the same place?

A 2-4 player dice rolling, area control game. Players compete to build and own the largest casinos on the strip, but losing control of your baby might be a dice roll away.

Fun time, I like the backstabbing and jostling for control in this game. I look forward to playing with more than 2. The game is perhaps a little long for what it is but perhaps we were just being slow learning it.

Something in this reminds me of Vegas Showdown, more than name that is. Though VS is much more a game.

Really liked this.  I love Chinatown, and this has a similar feel.  The gambling mechanic is a nice touch, and I like the fast pace.  Two players was better than expected; would love to try it out with 4.

Interesting mechanics. A game that really requires you to be mean to the other players. Strong Vegas/gambling feel.

Played once. Good game. Monopoly killer, can be played in an hour. Quick game.  I felt the randomness was a bit too much for me.  I did like the game, the theme, setting and mechanics were not difficult and is something I would play again.

Nice.  It has the familiar tang of [thing=3528][/thing], [thing=47][/thing], and even [thing=15364][/thing] and a little [thing=5][/thing], but it is definitely its own game.  Speculation and gambling are king, but shrewd play will tend to win over random acts.

By far my favourite game. I don't know what it is about Lords of Vegas that I truly love but there hasn't been a game when the group hasn't had a good time and revealed darker sides, especially the quieter guys. I've now played this with three different groups and the dynamics are as interesting as the game itself. Just wonderful.

After 1 Play: Lasts about twice as long as it should.  Reorganization (when you reroll all the dice in a casino) becomes really annoying near the end.  Players often have nothing batter to do with their money than take the long odds at controlling the big casinos, and the swings in ownership and subsequent point earning make the game up to then feel pointless.

Similar to Chinatown in concept, but completely different game play. i.e trading negotiating versus luck. However I really enjoyed playing this even though the dice can really work against you. Its all part of the theme - gambling, winning, expanding then losing all. A great game that you must not take seriously.

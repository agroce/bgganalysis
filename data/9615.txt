Pleasant little investment/screwage game.  The luck in the cards is a little too high, but the rules are easy and it plays smoothly enough.  Definitely should have had a '0' chip as well, a la [b]Royal Turf[/b]!

Simple, and somewhat frustrating game where players take turns placing passenger multipliers or or finishing trains. On your turn you either place passenger chip (value 1-3) or play a card from your hand and draw another card. When a train is completed it scores for every passenger on the train.

RATING: 5.5
There's a number of engines on the table which are numbered. The number shows the amount of passengers (chits from each player marked 1,2 or 3) and the number of carriages each train holds before it leaves. 

Players have cards which act as carriages or do things like move cards to discard, get cards back from discard pile, finish off the train and make it leave etc. The carriage cards go from +7 to -6 I think.

The total number of your chits times numbers from the carriage cards is your score. Can be positive or negative. Highest score after all trains leaves wins.

Quite random, especially when you don't know what the special cards are!

A Light and fun card game. A good dose of light strategy and some take that factor into it.  The scoring is a bit tough for newbies to figure out :Train good cars minus bad cars multiplied by passenger value, but one or two quick examples prior to play help them figure it out quickly.
Highly Recommended for families and people new to gaming.

This was a fun quick playing game that I got to demo at my flgs. The game was easy to learn and fun to play. Things get cut-throat as scoring goes back and forth drastically up to the very end. The flow of the game went well with hardly any down time between players and was short enough to qualify as a filler game. I really liked the fact that even near game end. There is the possibilty to come back and win. Even if you are way behind.

I would surely play this again if the opportunity arose, but I won't be buying this one. Only because I feel there are better filler games out there for me. But if you are one of those people that love train games. Then you may wanna give this one a try.

Many thanks to the owners Ed & Dina at All Things Fun for introducing this game to me. If you live in the southern New Jersey area. Be sure to look them up, as they are wonderful people who run an AWESOME game store.

Acquired December 2005. (As of November 2006) I like this game very much. With 6 players, it is a bit chaotic. The situation changes rapidly in this game, and it is a tough decision whether to use your turn to place passengers on a building train or to add cars to a train (with positive or negative values). The scoring lead normally changes with each completed train, throughout the game, so it's virtually impossible to predict the winner until the last train is scored. Play time is fairly short, so it's a good filler game.

2007 - With more plays, and with 8 players, I am enjoying this game even more. It is definitely a "keeper."

May 2009 -- It enjoy playing this game, but our daughter (who usually wins it) does not enjoy it, so we rarely play it.

October 2011 -- This game is not played often by us, particularly since our daughter is adamant about not playing it. We did play recently (when our daughter was absent from game day), and found it to be as crazy as ever. The special cards and the sneaky moves available (moving passenger tokens, ending trains short of their allowed length, etc.) can make this into a truly confrontational game. With the scores updated with each train completion, everyone targets the leading player(s) with negative carriage cars, and the lead generally changes rapidly throughout the game. Often, the winner is not apparent until the last train is scored.

Tried again. Luck-bound, boring-- don't get enough cards to make decisions about card play or placement useful.

2 player just not good. More players is a better-- cause then it's just chaos, but I still don't like it much.

Like the idea to have chips with 0 and -1 on it, and to increase hand limit, or allow both a card and a chip to be played.

Neat little game that plays pretty quickly. Better than I initially expected, although it seems like it would be much better with 3 or 4 players (it supports up to 6). We played with 5 and the game state was too volatile between turns with that number (6 would be even worse) but the mechanics seem like they could make it pretty neat with fewer. The luck factor is present but didn't seem too overwhelming - there are a few events that are a bit too powerful and if you get a bunch of really high/low cards it can really improve your position but on the whole it didn't feel too unbalanced.

First played this on April 21st, 2010. Taught in 5 minutes and played in about 40 minutes with 6 players. It has some strategy, however luck plays a big roll in what your opponents do. Each player is given 6 disks/coins (3-1's, 2-2's, and 1-3). Six loco's are placed out and each player is dealt a hand of 3 passenger cars. Passenger card deck consists of red(negative value), green (positive value), and yellow (have special rules). There are two special loco, freight (red cards are positive, green are negative) and passenger (special cards double points) that have only one of each in the deck (only maybe 20 loco's total). On a players turn you either play a passenger card or disk on the loco. Each loco has a # on it to designated both the number of disks and the number of passengar cars on it before the loco leaves the station (and scored). A new loco takes it's place after scoring and the game ends when all locos have left the station. I'd recommend giving this a gameplay if you know someone who has it.

A light train game filler, very easy to play. Players put positive or negative values on trains, and try to get their passengers on to score the value. There's the constant decision of whether to help yourself, screw the other players or try to load a passenger on a train.

Components are just cards and some markers. I would've liked to have been provided some method of scoring, but I suppose paper and pen works okay. Scoring is similar to Lost Cities so its probably best to have a mathematician at hand.

RATING: 6
Decent game as long as there are 3 or more players.  With two players, the gameplay is dramatically lacking, at least for me.  On your turn you can either place a chip representing 1,2,or 3 passengers on a train OR play a card (which is either a passenger card giving points to the train, a freight card which generally takes away points from all but the one freight locomotive, or special cards which do special actions).  There is one locomotive present for each player in the game and each locomotive has a number which represents maximum number of passenger chips and maximum number of cars in the train.  Points are scored when the train is completed by multiplying each player's number of passengers by the value of the train's passenger cars.

RATING: 7
This is a card game about matching up carriages/trucks with the engines, attempting to maximize your scoring of each train, while minimizing your opponents'. Carriages have values (both positive and negative) and you also add passengers, valued between 1 and 3, and your score for the train is the sum of the carriage values multiplied by the sum of your passengers. That can cover quite a large range. So some careful play is rewarded but there is a sizable amount of luck as well. But it is quite enjoyable and I am not sure why it has not seen more play. My eldest son likes playing with it (a big train fan) but for some reason it does not make it to the table to play.

Simple, fast-playing and highly interactive card game.  However, the rule set is weak - this game is just screaming for variants.  Some potential ideas that could raise my rating from a 5 to a 6 or 7 are - increased hand size, 0 bidding chips, taking 2 actions per turn, and not getting your betting chips back until you use them all.  I would have to try these ideas out, but isn't that the designer's job?  For such a simple idea, I feel this game was not playtested enough before release and it is a shame as it has potential for a 30 minute card game.

Tried this out last Friday in a six player game.  Picked up the concepts pretty quick, but in the end just wanted it to be over.  I was sick and our of contention early, which likely colored my feelings.  But found that with 6 folks at least it suffered from.

- Too chaotic.  State changes too much by the time it's your turn again for long-term planning.
- Many yellow cards too impactful.  Didn't get many of the powerful ones this game.  Felt screwed by this.  
- Too much down time.  AP involved even with small hand size.  Folks needed to keep running score totals whole game.
- Played too long for what it was.  

to a lesser extent
- player position important.  Can be thrown by a strong/weak player following you.

It's a filler, it's a stock game with a train theme, there's luck involved (card draws) and a lot of chances to screw your opponents.  The scoring is absolutely ridiculous with huge swings (keep your calculator handy).  There are also times when all you can do is play something that may hurt you.  Overall though, it's a fun game & that's what counts.  I feel "usually" the best player will will.

This fills a spot in my collection somewhere between Loco and Union Pacific.  Those two, and this one, are stock investing games, more or less.  Loco is super-easy and very fast.  UP is longish and a little harder to quickly grasp.  Station Master is in the middle - perfect for light game groups or a medium-length filler (30 minutes, maybe?) when you're in the mood for stocks.  Yes, I realize that's a pretty tight niche.

No need to play this one again. There's some opportunity for some clever play, but the game seems by and large driven by luck. I wouldn't mind it were it 15 minutes, but at 30 to 60 minutes, I'll pass: there are much better games out there for that time allotment.

A suprisingly addictive little game.  It didn't grab us at first but over time it has been the most played card game in the household bar none.  It's simple to learn rules allow you to get directly down to the bluff and diplomacy.

RATING: 6
A light game that plays quickly enough to be enjoyable. There aren't many tough decisions here - everything you do is more-or-less obvious and greatly depends on the cards you draw. It feels like it needs something to set it apart from the merely okay category, but I'm not sure what that could be as the design works perfectly as it is - it's just not very exciting. For comparison, it reminds me of a much-better-done Gold Digger.

Laugh-a-minute train builder with heaps of screwage for screwage's sake. Long on chaos and the least worst player will normally win.

Feels like a light version of Dragon's Gold, with people forming temporary alliances to score the booty, the differences being there's no negotiation and the players get to determine what the booty is (good or bad depending on whether they're on or not). The box said quick-paced, and it delivered that, which makes the game enjoyable enough for a quick non-serious romp.

Have only played once with two players. The game is easy and fastpaced (as the box promises), but it doesn't really work with only two players as all depth disappears into thin air and it becomes quite pointless. HOWEVER, it is clear, even though I still haven't played with more than two, that this is a really good game on 3  players if you're searching for a fun, easy and fastpaced cardgames about trains.

This is a light bidding game with a plausible train station theme. The game, especially the bidding mechanics, is similar to Gold Digger, but offers slightly more variety and options.
After my very first play I have a couple of ideas that I think would improve the game:

1) Change the number on two of the "1" chips: one of them to "0" and the other to "-1" (minus one). This combination would allow for more tactical play and also introduces an element of bluffing, which in turn adds tension to the game. The "-1" chip will be used on a train row that is expected to score a negative total, but will be scored as positive points for the player who bid the "-1" chip! For a less tactical but more bluffing game (or if math-challenged :-) instead of a "-1" chip, have a second "0" chip, leaving a single "1" chip.

2) Increase the hand limit to 4 cards instead of 3. This would increase play choices and makes the decision making tougher, more varied, and more interesting.

RATING: 7
A filler with an unexpected vicious bent. Some decisions on when to play passengers (chips value 1,2,3 as a multiplier for scoring both positive and negative). How to improve your position or beggar thy neighbor with bad cards. 
The 3 handed card puts a lot of luck in the card draw, you are rather at the mercy of it. However, the game is short so it is not onerous.

Can see the arguments of those who would like a 0 chip for bluffing and have 4 rather than 3 card hand - it may make for a more strategic game.

An OK bidding & bluffing game with no technical flaws (except possibly some large point swings that would happen as much in more experienced play) but that didn't really grab me either.

Man, do I dig this game.  It really is a simple stock game, but you can say the same of many train games (Well, perhaps not simple).  Don't expect more than a silly "take that" filler, but of the genre it feels like there is just so much more to it. Most of my complaints with many fillers is that there just aren't enough tough decisions. In this there is some great hand management and manipulation of bidding on stock. You want to get an edge up, but not to put your neck out too far. So many decisions with only one thing to do on a turn.  Even though at its heart it is a just stock game, it really feels like putting different important passengers on trains and the cards are evocotive enough that the end values of the trains make sense in theme.  Highly recommend it, I suspect that the rating will go up.

Works very well, good pacing for a simple claiming game where you either place a chip to claim a share of a train or add a card to affect the value of a train.  Some special power cards in the deck so it's not all cut and dried.  Slick design, fun to play.

RATING: 5
Train-themed card game with a fair share of ways to scupper your opponents. Players have to assign cards representing carriages and tokens representing passengers to various locomotives. Some of the carriages feature positive victory points and others negative. Players obtain the victory points depending on how many passengers they have assigned to the train, and that's pretty much it. The game's main strategy revolves around not committing passengers too early to a train, thereby giving your opponents the opportunity to lumber you with negative points, but early enough to benefit from a train that is likely to score highly. There are ample opportunities to cause other players problems with indirect conflict, but overall there isn't much replay value on offer here.

This is a nice card game, with a slight chaos factor imbued into it with some of the "Take That!" cards in the deck.  It's straightforward, but a lot of what you can do depends on the luck of the draw.  Luckily, it's short enough that this doesn't become too big of an issue.

An underrated game.  I'd call it a filler due to the short play length and the limited number of decisions.  However, it does have a lot of interaction and a cutthroat playing style is almost imperative.  There is also a lot of luck involved, as there are a few very powerful, game-changing cards.  The best aspect is that you have predict how the opponents will play, so it becomes a game of psychology.

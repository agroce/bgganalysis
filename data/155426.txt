OWN EXPANSION(s):
Castles of Mad King Ludwig Secrets
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This is currently my wife and my favorite two player game. We play with the 3-player setup, and it works fantastic. We get the satisfaction of "building" a castle, and most of our games have come down to just a few point swings. Admittedly, the game can suffer from analysis paralysis, and in 3 and 4 player games, there can be a lot of downtime between Master Builder turns. But, each turn, you are watching others build their castle, buy rooms that you want, and agonizing over under/overpricing something. The auction mechanic is neat, and the room variety is great. Add in the randomization of each set-up, and not knowing if you'll get what you want, and you have a very engaging board game experience. The only reason it's not a 10 in my book is the scoring track. Snake tracks aren't that great - but I don't have a solution otherwise. Great game - I'm always up for playing this.

RATING: 6
I've played majority of my plays either with 2 players or solo; very good game.  Played it with 3 players once and we had a fun time.  The master builder mechanic makes this game unique.  I may prefer Suburbia over this, but more plays of both games are needed.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I enjoy this more than Suburbia for the more relaxed feel,  more attractive theme, and the price setting auction which requires me to keep some attention paid to what others are doing (this is really where CoMKL adds interaction between players compared to Suburbia). The initial setup really blows though, makes me want to play 2 or 3 games in a row as a result, and like Caverna, I highly recommend either making an insert or buying a custom one. Second, the same number of turns regardless of player count looks nice on paper, but causes the game to stumble as you remove the tiles at random (In some ways, I'm curious how it works if you do a 2p game with 3p tile counts, sure, it takes longer, but how does that fit). Still more attractive in terms of desire to play than Suburbia for us.

I really wish there was more value paid to the a constrained castle vs just this perpetual sprawl that it almost always morphs into. Getting pieces that match castle goals almost always trumps the adjacency benefits of doing urban-style density.

7-10-15: This was huge at BGG.Con 2014 but I had no desire to play it based on the box cover. Whoops. This may be my favorite new game (to me) this year, and I've played a lot of new (to me) games this year.

It's like Carcassonne and Alhambra had a child and it was smarter and prettier than both of them.

Supersweet art. Some interaction through price-setting of tiles and decisions whether to spend more or less depending who the master builder is.

RATING: 7
This is a great theme marred by rather uninspiring gameplay and ugly aesthetics (much like its precursor Suburbia). There is nothing WRONG with the game mechanics - it all works well and there are lots of strategic decisions to be made - but there isn't much of a sense of fun in the game, which is crazy considering the fascinating theme. Some nice artwork would have helped - why does everything have to look so grey and boring? I preferred it to Suburbia, but if I was to play a tile-laying game along these lines, I would still opt for Glen More every time.

LIKE: Building castles. Being the master builder and selecting how the different rooms are priced.
DISLIKE: Iconography overload, and some icons are hard to discern. Game felt too long.
OVERALL: First game, we were all learning so perhaps that is why the game felt long, but some players were calculating min/max point scoring with certain combos which slows down any game. It should be an hour tops, but ended up 2.5h. Second game was quicker. It's an ok game.

RATING: 9
I have my doubts about replayability, but I loved my one play of this and would definitely play it again if I get the opportunity.

Still a 9 after my second play.  It's not great as a competitive game and it's a little long for what it offers, but it is just a lot of fun to build your castle!

Original juego de gestión de losetas para formar superficie de habitaciones de un castillo, con elección del precio de las losetas por parte del último jugador en elegir loseta. Muchas formas de puntuar, cierto factor azar, pero en general muy original y entretenido. Fácil de explicar y de sacar a mesa.

RATING: 8
I have to say that the implementation is nowhere near elegant for a tile laying game. By saying this I am referring to the rule how you must align the tiny little doors on the tiles of varying shape and size. It would not be an issue, if all the tiles had a similar contact surface. However, this is not the case since you have to match, e.g., a circle with a rectangle. Having your tiles just 0.1 mm off can cause a situation where the next tile does not physically fit into to your preferred slot, or vice versa you can pull off illegal moves by shifting the other tiles slightly and squeezing an elephant into a keyhole.

Anyway, the above is maybe the only complaint I have about the game. I enjoyed the theme (which is quite strongly present for an eurogame), the market speculation, and of course the whole aspect of laying tiles and creating combos. Moreover, the market with a limited amount of money in circulation is a nice touch. Variable bonuses and tiles guarantee longevity, I reckon. Art is not great but not bad either. The individually named rooms add flavour to the game. You can almost feel how you are building a castle for a truly mad king.  

A small concern for some groups might be the expected brain burn when the starting player sets up the market at the beginning of the round. If you are playing with very tight players who necessarily want to gather and analyse all available information, this phase of the game can become a quite long and frustrating experience. For our group this was not a problem, though.

Castles of Mad King Ludwig has potential to become a classic.

This is a great, fun, and well designed game, although it is a bit slower and more fiddly than Suburbia... however let me tell you a story:

I bought the game at a con, as an experienced board gamer. The components were as I expected, as was the size of the box. However I can't help but reflect on how careless the product design is. A person new to the hobby, picks up this exciting looking game and buys it. They punch the game, and have a box full of tiny bits floating around. No insert, no baggies. They don't realise the game expects them to supply these and as a result the game sits unloved on a shelf since it is so fiddly to set up, and half the tiny pieces are missing since they fell out of the box.

Fundamentally, this reinforced to me, the idea that Ted Alspach (and Bezier Games) do not care about the ownership experience. they care about profit. The slight increase in a profit margin is much more important than the players. Here is a game built with love but presented with none. And that made me sad. It feels like we're not a community any more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Ted Alspach's next big game from Bezier game's after his Mensa select hit, "Suburbia". At first blush it can be easy to look at the game's appearance and note the designer and think that it is similar to and should be compared to Suburbia but that would be a mistake. While there are whispers of commonality in some of the mechanics in this game it is a very different animal all together and deserves to be seen as such. Castle's theme is pretty solid and the narrative drive aligns well with play. You are playing the role of a royal ass hat who bankrupted his country building more and more elaborate and sometimes ridiculous castles. I read somewhere that the Disney castle is based on one of his. The reason this aligns with play is that you spend the game drafting rooms and using them to build your own personal castle. Each type of room has a power that triggers when placed next to other rooms in a similar way to the tile placement mechanic in Suburbia. There are of course secret and public objectives which you are building your castle to achieve in order to out score your opponent which adds a little variability to the game. The result is a bunch of crazy looking castles that leave you wanting to kill somebody. If the game has any controversy it would be found in the drafting mechanic which is the primary means of generating revenue. Each turn someone plays the role of master builder. Their job is to arrange the available flop of rooms in order along a draft line with prices in ascending order. The idea is, the builder gets revenue based on what people ultimately pay for drafting a room. So if the builder plays their arrangement well, they effectively balance their need for revenue with their opponents need for rooms while still not giving away what they need to win or what their opponent needs to achieve known game objectives. The problem is, valuation is pretty tricky and if you get it wrong either by missing certain details on the board or not understanding certain player biases beyond your goal than you are broke for an entire round. This... Pretty much costs you the game if you aren't careful. Still, another excellent game by Alspach and proof of his range as a designer. I am glad I own this game and will be keeping it in my collection. It will be interesting to see what he makes next. Hopefully, he'll show some range on components next time as well.

I wonder what would happen if people started playing "Castles of Mad King Ludwig: the couples edition". You know, exactly the same game, but this time each castle is built by a pair of two human beings that, preferably, share the same roof in their non-boardgaming life. HE could finally impress HER with his Tetris-skills and create the optimal room plan, SHE could design the perfect harmony between living room curtains and grotto lighting. BOTH could discuss whether it might be a good idea to have the theater room directly adjacent to the kitchen. After the game is over, they could go back to their real home and, even though it will be much less impressive than the fantasy castle they just created, they will still happily agree that their fictitious castle was obviously MUCH better than that hell of a garden massacre that Liz and Pete were building. 
I really wonder when relationship therapists will realize the possibilities of this game ...

A spiritual successor to Suburbia.  It comes with similar tile placement mechanics: certain tiles will interact with other tiles (especially when placed directly beside each other).  The Master Builder sets the price for the available rooms, making it a game of guessing how much your opponents are willing to pay!  Great game.

1st play: Interesting tableau building, with lots of various goals and I liked the master builder aspect. I didn't expect all the rooms to line up very well, but the game is designed well and they do. Looking forward to playing again now that I have a better idea of what to expect.

2nd play: The game made more sense the second time around, with room bonuses tying together better and a set of 4 very appealing castles. Lots of variety in the rooms art and straightforward rules make this a pretty decent game.

Bought this game following a love affair with Suburbia and it provides a very interesting twist on the tile laying game format. It has more theme than Suburbia but its downfall was that to play with 2 players, which we usually do, it was too short and thus required us to tweak the rules to play with the 3 player set up. This made the game a delightful 2 player experience and allows you to immerse yourself in the world of castle building.

I really like this game. It takes the skeleton of Suburbia and does something pretty different with it. The various completion bonuses of the different room types and hooking all the little rooms together for synergies is pretty interesting. 

The "master builder" role of completely re-arranging the real estate market every round is bit of a love-hate mechanic. It's simultaneously fascinating and potentially frustrating. For experienced players, it's a strategic, engrossing decision. But newer players are almost guaranteed to break it. It requires a fair degree of familiarity with what kind of buildings are in the game in order to make good decisions about what things should be worth. 

This isn't specifically a bad thing. Experience should reward players. But (a) it means that new players throw balance a little bit out the window and (b) it can be an AP-inducing mechanic. Nevertheless, Mad King is fun, quirky, and neat.

Everybody likes it. It's a fun game. I really enjoy building the castles. The design is super smooth. It's hard for me to pick out flaws. It only lacks a little bit of 'oomph' in the strategy department. I would appreciate some more depth or interesting complexity. But it's an excellent game.

I mostly play this game as a phone app nowadays, but it's a great lightish game that's a nice mix of optimization puzzle and guess-how-much-people-will-pay.

(I know there's a prettier European edition but it's hard to read the tile colors...)

Quicker game than expected, but quite a bit of thinking. Also, designing castles is grand fun. I played Suburbia once and enjoyed it, but this removed it from my buy list.

Castle building is just plain fun. The visual elements of the game are satisfying, the Master Builder element is a great interaction tool, and the game requires a surprising amount of thought while not taking too long.

Really wish it had come with an insert though. The game is weirdly aggravating to set-up.

I really love this game not just for the fact that you're making totally crazy and implausible castles, but I love the spatial challenge involved. The auctioning and price setting mechanics can be a bit tricky to get at first, but the game is great fun with lots of replay value through the goals. It's different enough from Suburbia for me that I would play them both.

A game that strips out all the things I disliked about Suburbia, while retaining some similarities, both superficial and mechanical.  Ludwig's market, with the start player setting the prices of the available rooms, is perhaps its nicest feature.  The rest is about placing rooms with harmonious neighbours and chasing bonuses.  It all works perfectly well and I'd be reasonably happy to play again if it were suggested.

Given the beauty of the real Ludwig's castles, the game's artwork has to rate a missed opportunity.  There is a lot of drab grey and much of the art has a cheap, computer generated look.  Production quality is decent.

Εδώ οι παίχτες χτίζουν ο καθένας το κάστρο του προσέχοντας πως θα τοποθετήσουν τα δωμάτια και τους διαδρόμους ώστε να πάρουν όσο το δυνατό περισσότερους πόντους. Αυτό που ξεχωρίζει στο παιχνίδι είναι ο μηχανισμός του Master Builder. Κάθε γύρα αυτός καθορίζει τις τιμές των δωματίων. Μετά οι υπόλοιποι παίκτες επιλέγουν πρώτοι τα δωμάτια που θέλουν πληρώνοντας τον Master Builder, ο οποίος επιλέγει τελευταίος και πληρώνει στη τράπεζα.

Το όλο πράμα δουλεύει πολύ καλά. Ο μηχανισμός είναι απλός και λειτουργικός. Πρέπει να δεις ποια δωμάτια ενδιαφέρουν τους υπόλοιπους και να θέσεις τις τιμές ανάλογα. Κατά τα άλλα υπάρχουν κάποια goals που είναι ανοιχτά από την αρχή του παιχνιδιού και δίνουν πόντους στο τέλος του παιχνιδιού. Πχ να έχεις τα πιο πολλά υπνοδωμάτια στο κάστρο σου.

Εκτός από τα φανερά goals, οι παίκτες έχουν και κάρτες (αποστολές) που επίσης δίνουν πόντους στο τέλος. Όλα αυτά δίνουν μια κατεύθυνση στους παίκτες προς τα πού να κινηθούν, ποια δωμάτια να κυνηγήσουν.

Στα αρνητικά να βάλω πως το παιχνίδι είναι κάπως overpriced αν το κρίνεις με βάση τα components τα οποία είναι απλά tiles και tokens με λιτά γραφικά. Επίσης όλα τα δωμάτια απλά δίνουν πόντους με βάση τα γειτονικά δωμάτια. Δεν υπάρχουν κάποια σπέσιαλ abilities, κάτι που θα έδινε κατά την γνώμη μου περισσότερο βάθος στο παιχνίδι. Από την άλλη βέβαια το ότι τα δωμάτια είναι απλά κάνει το παιχνίδι πιο προσβάσιμο στο ευρύ κοινό και έχει μόνο λίγα απλά εικονίδια πάνω στα tiles αντί για γραμμές κειμένου.

Αξιόλογο tile placement eurogame με απλούς κανόνες και γρήγορο ρυθμό. Ο μηχανισμός του master builder που θέτει τις τιμές είναι πολύ λειτουργικός και κάνει το παιχνίδι να ξεχωρίζει.

Estupendo juego de subastas y colocación de losetas. Muy en la linea de Suburbia, aunque aquí con una acertada estética mediaval. Prefiero CMKL sobre este último, por un reglamento mejorado y sencillo, duración contenida, la estetica y que es accesible para todo el mundo

Como puntos negativos hay que mencionar que requiere de bastante mesa si son mas de 3 jugadores; entre la construcción de nuestros castillos, los tableros donde se situan las losetas y el de puntuación.Y también que la caja trae mucho aire para el precio que tiene.

Espero que salgan también expansiones para este juego; 
Muy recomendable

Revising my rating of this game a bit upward. It just hits all the sweet spots I like. I need more multi-player time with it, but the strategy is just complex and intricate and really delightful. I NEED the expansion when it releases.

Edit: 7/30/15 - Really think the solitaire version is more luck-based than strategic. Sure there's strategy involved, and it helps to be on the lookout for good Outdoor Food tiles, and even that nice Utility room, but if you get some bum bonus cards, and then your tiles are not optimal, you're toast.

I really wanted to like this more than I do; the theme is great and the pieces look cool.  You need to have a good knowledge of the tiles to be able to quickly analyse your opponent's layout and work out how to value tiles for which made it a bit too troublesome for me.

The comments regarding this game being prone to AP in the Master Builder phase appear to be totally unfounded, regardless of whether you're playing with first timers or not. It's an excellent game with loads to do and insane levels of replayability. It wont replace Suburbia for me but I suspect it might even be a better game. It's certainly much more beautiful than its cousin.

RATING: 9
A castle building, "variable size tile" tile-laying game that creates a warm enjoyable gaming experience.  The pricing mechanic, somewhat to my surprise, worked nicely to create fun decisions, and the public and secret goals worked nicely in the game.  

Thinking about the design here, I can see how certain design issues were considered and capably addressed.  I found it fascinating how when this game was first explained to me, I firmly believed that the "door to door line up" issue was going to be a major design problem, particularly with all these disparate shapes, but after a few turns, the challenge of lining up doors felt interesting, and by the end of the game, this challenge managed to feel fresh, interesting, and a curious incentive to play the game again. 

The builder in us evidently enjoys lining up doors and building interesting looking castles.  As such, there is some magic in this game design.  Well done.  8 of 10 , November 2014

Going to raise Castles to a 9 for its sheer design brilliance.  Excellent re-playability, spatially, strategically and tactically.  Excellent expansion with the moats and swans.  October 2016.

Similar to Alhambra, but with a slightly manic edge and a little more freedom in building the castle.

While there are certainly signs of the game being influenced by Suburbia, it easily stands on its own. The 2-player game is far too short as it ends right as the game starts to get fun and interesting. We've found that using cards and tiles for a 4-player game make things much more enjoyable. Got our box autographed by Ted at Essen 2014 when we picked it up from him!

Very light and pretty fun design. And I really like games that (sort of) envolve architectural design.

The decisions of which room to buy and add to your middle age piece of real estate based on the numerous ways to score is the real heart of the game and it is pretty interesting. And it is by no means obvious.

However, building your castle and deciding in what position to fit the new additions is not as hard and possibly constrictive as it is in Factory Fun, for example, a game that I enjoy immensely. You will never feel the need to build your castle in a more "efficient" matter next time.

In Factory Fun, at the end of a match you sometimes feel really proud of your plant design, both in terms of aesthetics and efficiency. In this game, that is not much of a factor, which I found a little frustrating.

RATING: 9
No disrespect to Suburbia, but Castles is a VASTLY superior game (I rated Suburbia a 6).  

The tile laying and building selection (master builder) action is infinitely more interesting than Suburbia.  Also, they made the end game scoring for the shared goals friendly, so it isn't just a 1-1 race to get X goal.

The hidden goals from the utility rooms offered a nice strategic direction and the castles that we saw were extremely varied in size/shape/function.

Superficialmente, el construir el castillo es algo muy entretenido.

A lot of things to love about this game. Love the metagame of playing tetris and trying to fit the rooms together perfectly. The concept of having to pay the other players for room tiles is clever, creating really interesting decisions when pricing. If the other players get the rooms they want, they'll at least have to pay you a good amount for it which also benefits you. The theme is really fun as well. Really like the stories that can be created regarding who would actually live in your castle and how it would be utilized.

One downside I'm noticing is that games can seem a little repetitive. The decisions you make each turn can feel kind of the same, and there's little progression as the game goes on.

RATING: 9
It is hard to rate this one.  Similar enough to Suburbia but different enough to make it it's own game and warrant being a game.  Which is better though?  Suburbia or Castles of Mad King Ludwig.  It is a very close race if you ask me but this one wiggles out ahead just a little bit because of the Master Builder mechanic and the varying ways you can build your castle.  Suburbia is still great mind you.  This is just a little better.

This game is amazing! Connecting different rooms in your castle adds a really cool spacial element to the game. Because the size and shape of the rooms vary, the game is a cut above the other tile-laying hits like Surburbia and Carcassone. 

Tile acquisition is the best I've seen. Tense, and very tactical.

Was not terribly thrilled by the aesthetics of the game, I wish the building pieces looked better and the components were a little higher quality in general...with an insert in the box. That said, this is a solid structure building game where you score by matching up particular symbols and colors. The shifting Master Builder has a huge impact on the construction market and there is some definitely flavor. Simple but at the same time, a lot you can keep track of with your personal objectives. A good time.

Perhaps my expectations were too high but this didn't really grab me. Fiddly, in a word. Physically fiddly with some quite small room pieces with small symbols, and fiddly scoring during the course of the game and at the end. The multitude of hidden victory point cards negates much chance of knowing what opponents are aiming for and therefore any hope of preventing them. I'd play again but it's not high up my list.

Finally get to play my first game of Castles of Mad King Ludwig with my gf yesterday at my FLGS.  I was so excited not only because it's my first time going to a gamer cafe, but because I finally get to play Mad King.  First impression, not as fun as I expected it to be due to the slower speed.  I'm prone to AP to begin with, so even with 2 players sometime I can take a bit of time to decide how to price the buildings.  I do like the placing and building of my own castles, love it even more when I was able to carry out my plan and chain some combos together.  The final scoring was fun and exciting as we reveal our secret objectives even though we missed handing out points for buildings whose stack has been depleted.  The game would benefit greatly from some good inserts, components are everywhere.  Conclusion, still like it even though not as much as I expected, would love to give it another try.

A lapkamenedzselős-lepakolgatós műfajban az egyik legjobb, amivel valaha játszottam. Viszonylag egyszerű szabály, de végtelen kombólehetőségek. Nincs két egyforma helyiség... Random kerülnek játékba a helyiségek, 10 féle méretben, és összesen 6 típusban. Minden méretben 3 féle típus fordul elő. Némi tematika is átjön, pl. a hálószoba mellett bünteti a játék ha zenetermet rakunk le. Jó dolog a 2 szint is, a különböző alakok is jól mutatnak(kis kör, nagy kör... pl.), és a 7 féle jutalom dobja fel legjobban, az ad neki igazán mélységet. Ami hátrány, az a nagyon nagy AP veszély. Nekünk a 2 fős parti volt tisztán bő 3 óra. A helyiségek sorbarendezése nagyon időigényes lehet, 4 főnél el se tudom képzelni meddig lehetne vele szüttyögni, ha tényleg mérlegeljük, hogy kinek mi a jó. Már ketten se nagyon volt rá esély hogy komolyan figyeljünk az ellenfél épületeire. Ennek ellenére pont ez a sorbarendezés adja a játék sava-borsát. Amire még figyelni kell, hogy elég nagy épületek jöhetnek ki, nekünk a játék 2/3-ánál arrébb kellett tolni az egyik teljes kastélyt, mert összeért a kettő, és nagyon macerás volt. A helyiség választásnál egyébként elég sok mindenre kell figyelni: van néhány építési szabály is, de ami nehezebb, hogy bizonyos bónuszok nem a szomszéd helyiségek után járnak csak, hanem a teljes kastélyunkra vonatkoznak, ezeket észben kell tartani, mert ha kimarad egy pontszám, azt utólag nehéz már követni. (Több száz pont szerezhető egy partiban.) Emellett nagyon fontos tényező a játékban, hogy az ellenfelet mennyire pénzeljük. Ha el tudjuk érni, hogy pénzszűkébe kerüljön (mert pl. a saját körünkben vesszük a drágább épületeket), akkor olcsóbban juthatunk épülethez, igaz hogy ilyenkor kevesebbet is fog tejelni az ellenfél... A sok pont ellenére nekünk nagyon kiegyenlített lett a 2 személyes partink, nüanszok döntöttek. Szerintem jól össze van rakva az egész, pont olyan bonyolult, amennyit még hajlandó vagyok újrajátszani ebből a típusból. Sokkal hamarabb ülnék le játszani vele, mint a Suburbiával, mondom ezt úgy, hogy mindkettővel 1 partin vagyok túl.
Ja mellesleg jól néz ki az egész: a szobák is, meg a lapkatároló táblák is...

Kellemes meglepetés: egy háromfős parti kevesebb, mint 2 óra alatt lement. De hogyhogy a kétszemélyes olyan hosszú volt a múltkor?

Very interesting castle building game in which every turn you may get a tile to build your mad castle.  It uses the mechanism that the master builder proposes the price of the tiles, but he is the last one to get one.  And this works really fine.  The puzzle part is also interesting.  Scoring system seems to be much easier than you get from the rules.  I'm not 100% that we did it correctly on our first and only game...

Suburbia streamlined.  Scoring is simpler and play is smoother.  A combination of Surburbia, Vegas Showdown, and Isle of Skye (yeah, I know CoMKL came out before this game).  The bluffing aspect, the variable scoring, and multiple ways to win makes this a very replayable game.

Initial Impression: Despite the drab color palette chosen for the tiles, this is one of the few tile-laying games that I truly enjoy. I believe that it's the introduction of the commerce mechanism that adds the much needed twist for me. The decision of which price to give to each component is really the main decision in the game, as well as which bonuses to shoot for. This game was instantly a hit with my family as the end-game creations were fascinating to explore and allowed us to create stories as to why each room of the castle was positioned where it was. Overall I can see this game hitting the table often during our Family Game Nights.

Spin off sequel to suburbia! I like it just as much as I like suburbia, even though it has similar mechanics, the feel is different and fresh! You always end up with a castle with its own character and story. This is easier to teach compared to suburbia and gives you more control over the tile market, making it a near perfect game.

Not quite quick enough and not enough player inteaction. Also, there is too much counting and watching other people counting.

Rating increased from 8.5 as lots of variability in games.

Another well designed game by Mr Alspach. The master builder mechanic makes it more interactive than Suburbia and keeps the economy tight, however the lack of engine building makes it less deep though simpler. I am happy to own and play both.

Kasteel bouwen met tegels waarvoor je deels hebt kunnen kiezen.
Combi van Vorsten van Florence (passen de tegels wel), Puerto Rico (muntjes leggen op de tegels die niet gekozen worden), bonuskaartjes à la ticket to ride, en wat bluf.
Bonuskaartjes zijn een gelukselement.
Veel strategie/tactiek, weinig geluk.

Origineel concept toch.
Nadeel voor mij is het gebrek aan interactie: Iedereen zit nogal te tellen wat voor hem marginaal het meest punten oplevert voor de minste kost.
Tip: 1 punt voor 1000 munten.  Indien beter: doen!

Probeer nog eens opnieuw; misschien dat er met andere spelers wat minder punten geteld worden :-)

A fun game can really go the strategy route or the fun build your castle route.  Part of the auction system that becomes fun is determining if your opponent will pay more for a thematic room than a strategic one.

This one was a pleasant surprise. I can't compare it to Suburbia, but I liked it much better than The Capitals, another similar game.

The market mechanism is pretty neat. The last player in each round chooses the pricing for said round. But the money paid for each building in that round goes to that player. So, you have to carefully set prices such that the other players are willing to pay you large amounts for their needed buildings, while you get the one you want for cheap. It gives the game an interesting decision point (How high do I price the rooms other people want? How high do I price the room I want? What is my contingency plan in case someone buys the building I want?).

The room placement and comboing are also fun. You can create chains of closed rooms for additional actions, points, or other resources. The buildings have some odd shapes, which creates some cool logistical problems that are less Tetris-y and more Frank Lloyd Wright.

I think I'll probably end up getting this one, as it seems to have subtly deeper gameplay than its exterior would suggest.

CoMKL is a very good follow-up to Suburbia, although I prefer the latter. After a half-dozen plays it's pretty apparent the game is a bit AP prone. Both games suffer from lengthy setup, in my opinion, especially with minimal player counts. But where Suburbia's Real Estate Market has a streamlined replacement system, CoMKL bogs down as the Master Builder creates the next iteration of the Contract Board. Although this does add a strategic element that Suburbia lacks, I don't believe a better game is created. However, I do enjoy it, and castle construction is just so darn cool. Though it takes awhile, I've never been disappointed with my creations.

We played a really close 2 player game of this. I did get one rule wrong (about the end game scoring discs), but I still would have lost. The freedom you have to just go crazy with how you put the rooms together is what sold me on this game. Obviously, you are going to try to build towards your goal cards, but there is some leeway in doing silly things as well. The expansion (which I also have) looks like it restricts the building to a smaller area. That can be good or bad. Either way, this is a keeper.

I played this for the first time at BGG.con 2014 and I didn't think I would like it because I don't like Suburbia.  While there are a lot of similarities, I like several things about Castles of Ludwig quite a bit better.  One is the way in which the market is set.  It is critical that the Master Builder decides quickly and doesn't fret about the details of where everything goes.  Also, the spatial aspect of the game is a huge plus, especially because my wife thrives on spatial play in games.  After two plays, I've rated this game a 7 but it is very close to an 8 for me.  Part of that is definitely because I see this having the potential to be a game that my wife really enjoys.  It's fine with 2 players, but gets more interesting with more.

A visually pleasing strategy-placement game. Purchasing rooms and placing them just right to create current/future synergies is a great mechanic for my specific gaming group. Sometimes players don't even care about the end game victory, they'd rather have fun just trying to make a cooky, beautiful, or expansive castle. Sometimes in late game it gets a tad confusing as you have many rooms to keep track of and score but as long as everyone is helping each other then it keeps the flow moving smoothly.

Initial Impressions:
-----------------------
This one is a lot of fun!  The puzzle aspect of how to score points is interesting, but it was also fun to role play and tell stories of why you are putting the Queen's bedroom next to the guest room... :)

Only played with 2p so far, but I am a little worried about downtime with 4p.  One I am looking forward to playing much more! Also really like the "i'll cut the cake, you get to pick the slice" mechanism in this one... Fits perfectly!

UPDATE 1:
------------------------
I moved my rating to a 9 (from an 8) after playing a 3p game and having the game work very well ( I think it actually works better at 3 than 2 ).  Still don't know about 4 players, but I have better hopes of it working.  A very special game from 2014!

Nagyszerű hangulatot adó játék. Nekem a grafika részletes kidolgozottsága nagyon tetszik, bár sokan kritizálják. Az elemek karton vastagsága viszont szégyenletes. Bőven lett volna benne hely normális vastagságú kartonokra, de gondolom megint a pénz, bár az ára elég borsos. A külső doboz véletlenül sem illeszkedik a polcon a többi játék dobozához. Ezt sem értem miért, mert nincs benne olyan, melyet nem lehetett volna egy kicsit kisebbre szabni. A kiadótól van másik játékom, de annak a doboza szabvány méretű.
A játék viszont nagyon tetszik. Legfőbbként az tetszik, ahogy magunk rendezzük be, mely kastélyelem mennyibe kerül úgy, hogy minél több bevételhez jussunk a többi játékostól miközben a számunka kiszemelt elem megmaradjon a kör végére. Érdekes kastélyok alakulnak ki a játék végére és számtalan kombinációt össze lehet állítani. A játékban elég sok szempontot lehet figyelembe venni, hogy elérjük a a győzelmet. Ennek előnye az, hogy képtelenség minden lehetőséget kiszámolni. Folyamatosan változnak a lehetőségek. Én kifejezetten örülök, hogy megvettem :)

It has a lot of the same bones as Suburbia, but the way it plays out is completely different, due to the layout of your castle, and how it evolves as the game progresses.

Felt like I was losing all game, as I was mainly going for end-game scoring and it paid off. An awesome combo on the last turn allowed me to tie for 2nd in one of the end-game scoring categories I was 3rd in, and squeak out one extra point, and since I won the game by 1 point, it was a great combo (and I love building combos).

Definitely would not play this game with people prone to AP and over-analyzing, but other than that, I surprisingly liked it a lot.

Clearly a game from the creator of Suburbia, which I found a fun game to play that got less fun each time I played it. I got too annoyed by the luck factor. This game has roughly the same ideas for scoring points, but variates with asymetrical tiles and a kind of auction mechanism for pricing instead of the fixed prices in Suburbia.

On paper it could have been an improvement on Suburbia, but apart from the shape of the tiles I liked it even less than Suburbia. Too fiddly for my taste given that it's a lightweight game. What doesn't help is that I don't like the graphical design.

I like this game. Polish edition is so beautiful (I know that English version is ugly and the colors are faded). Game has strong theme - You really feel like builder (designer) of the castle. Game is not easy at all. You have to plan ahead and think what to do. You will find rivarly here (auction mechanism). 

BUT! IF YOU PLAN TO PLAY THIS GAME WITH MORE THAN 2 PEOPLE IT IS JUST ABSURDITY. It loses everything. It is almost impossible to control what is going on at the table. My rating is strong 7 (2 players) but more than 2 players my rating would be 5 only.

It is the game approved by MENSA. It is actually "Suburbia" successor.

Luck of molding inside the box is a pain in the ass..

- playing time (60-90 minutes; more than 2 players: 120, if at least one of them has paralysis of decision-making: can be ages ;) ).

STRONG RECOMMENDATION FOR 2 PLAYERS.

Over the top frustrated by the scoring explanation in the rule book. We actually had to go online and watch game play videos to understand it.

Bought used off Craigslist. Excellent condition. The family enjoys this one.  It has a lot of replay-ability and we really like the master builder rule.  We think we will try incorporating it into Suburbia to see how it works out.  The one downside we see in the game is that when played with the recommended set up with 2-3 players there doesn't feel like enough pieces going out before you run out.  But with 4 players the game seems to drag on too long.  It is an odd thing and entirely subjective.  Will have to see how that changes over more plays.

Fast and easy game with limited interaction. Everybody builds own castle and money is constantly transferred from one player to another.

Having been to Linderhof and Neuschwanstein on my trip to Germany, this caught my eye immediately.  The rules are very simple.  It's a cool medium light tile laying game and it's fun to watch your castle take shape.  The different rooms are cool, Secret Lair etc.  The main aspects are placing your rooms to maximize your points and also the master builder mechanic, which is basically one player setting the prices of tiles then he gets the money spent on tiles that turn but also goes last.  It's really a great mechanic- it's simple and easy to understand but it creates some excruciating decisions and creates a lot of indirect interaction.  You need to be looking at other players castles and you want them to pay you as much as possible for the rooms they are likely to buy, of course if you price them too high they will take something else or pass and take some free cash, and you also want to place the room you want so you can get it cheap enough but so other players won't buy it.  Very cool.  I like this better than Suburbia in virtually every way- it's quicker, it's more fun and prettier to build the castle than the city, it's less fiddly with cube pushing and arithmetic, and more interactive.

Wow- fantastic first play. Many in my gaming club have compared this to Suburbia with some preferring that one. Not me. This seemed better in all respects. First of all, theme. Having different shaped tiles and having to piece together a castle worked much better than the staid old Suburbia pieces (although pieces for both Suburbia and this could benefit from some art infusion). I liked the 'master builder' concept a lot, and also preferred the mechanic of the special abilities for finishing off rooms. On top of that, being much more free with the bonus point cards completely opens up another strategy to explore. Loved this first play, will likely buy soon although my boardgame spend has been a little high lately....

06/12: Play #6 now and loving it the more I play. Bumping to a 9.

Edit: One of my absolute favorites of all time. Would play anytime, anywhere. Have been playing the game for a year now and not tired at all. Glad this has been a recent focus game at EBGL.

I like this as much as Suburbia, even though it is a step down from the complexity level, it offers enough choices to make it interesting. The master builder (first player) gets to agonize over the values of the rooms, and then players get to agonize over how much to pay him. This alone makes the game, but there is the planning that is similar to Suburbia, in getting the best bang for your buck in scoring. And the castles are a sight to behold at the end of the game. Great theme! I don't see this getting old soon.

Castles of Mad King Ludwig is just plain fun!

I like getting to build up my own little castle that usually turns into something comical.

I really like the mechanic of being the master builder and setting the prices. There's a great tension between trying to get as much money out of the other players as possible while at the same time being able to afford what you really want.

The size of the tiles is kind of disappointing. I know that much bigger and it would take up too much of the table, but an individual tile still feels a little underwhelming. Also the lack of insert and/or box size vs component volume is annoying.

Not [i]quite[/i] as good as Suburbia but that may change. I prefer Suburbia with 2 to this, but think I like this with 4 more than I like Suburbia with 4.

11/2016 - Rating adjusted down. I found I never really wanted to play this, and it's because I get no long term strategic enjoyment out of building my city. The combos and synergy I like about Suburbia isn't front and center.

Interesting game, after a few more live plays I might rate this above Suburbia. The variation in buildings makes it more visually entertaining, and arranging the tiles is not as fiddly as I was afraid it would be.

One of my few 9s from 2014.   A solid game that's not too complicated, that is thematically interesting (who doesn't want to build a castle?), and that has a nifty auction mechanism.  The wife also enjoys this one.

Enjoy this one more than suburbia.

RATING: 4
The lack of set standards in the length and width of the tiles makes the game extremely tactical, AP inducing and chaotic. Why is there no grid-system present in the game?! The fact that a difference of a couple of millimeters is something you have to consider is just ridiculous. I mean just imagine playing BärenPark where the tiles aren't formed according to set size standards. It'd be a mess of a game trying to concoct a strategy without actually knowing the proper proportions of the pieces. It's just obscure for the sake of being obscure.

Sigh. I really didn't want to like this, as I don't need another Suburbia clone (especially since Suburbia is already one of my favorite games). But I have to say, I really like this one: Alspach's rules are streamlined and simplified, and the game just plays a lot smoother than Suburbia. I also think I like the theme of this a little more, being a huge Wagner fan, and the players' castles just look awesome as the game unfolds. 

I still think Suburbia is a better game, with more challenging decisions, and a slightly heavier, more punishing rule set, along with more things to keep track of. Nevertheless, I think I might actually like Ludwig more, for its simplicity and lightness. Definitely a keeper.

Tedious victory point salad engine. Everybody builds their own castle using tiles with tiny icons. The only interaction is when you're supposed to set the price of the tiles in the market for your opponents, but you can barely see what they're building over in their play area, and what they build doesn't affect anybody else.

First few games on the iPad were fun. Interested to try Isle of Skye to compare the two but CoMKL seems to be less strategic in that you don't know what bonus cards others have and bonus cards can determine a game. Also, feels possibly more AP-inducing than Isle of Skye though it remains to be seen after I play Isle of Skye.

A wee bit footery when it comes to fitting all the bits together and keeping them that way, but I really enjoy this. The auction works well and is tough to price, there's nice variation in the pieces and sets and the end result is satisfying visually. All good.

:thumbsup: [b]POSITIVE POINTS:[/b]

++ Good tactical tile-laying game with an auction mechanism to buy the tiles to build our own castle.
++ I like that you have to manage the spacial element of the tiles in your castle to respect some criteria (proximity from other type of room to combo with them) which for the most part feel thematic.
++ I like the funky-shaped tiles (and the humour in some of the room names) and the the match with the theme (the Mad King Ludwig wants a funky looking castle).


:thumbsdown: [b]NEGATIVE POINTS:[/b]

-- (Physical version only) The setup and tear down is too much for me, because of all the different shapes we need to sort out, also with the fact that the game doesn't come with an insert to help on this matter.
-- (Physical version only) I find this game too fiddly and with a lot of upkeep, as we always have to calculate every points we do from the room itself, the adjacent rooms' bonus and the downstairs room bonus. The final scoring is also fiddly. 
-- Even though there is a potentially great mechanism with the Master Builder, it's hard to efficiently play since there is a lot of small icons to check in every player's tableau to gauge the value on each tiles. So this feel in the end too fiddly and the game is either too multiplayer solitaire (like at the full player count if people doesn't care to carefully evaluate the tiles and price them randomly - so in the end you make do with what you have ans thus the mechanism isn't really new), or it leads to endless AP if the players want to correctly value the tiles (according to the tile points, the tile adjacency bonuses, the in-game bonus, etc.).
-- Mostly tactical with just a bit of strategy (not much long-term planning can be done), so in the end, I think Suburbia is the better game.

RATING: 7
A very nice game of tile placement, where you want to obtain and place tiles in such a way that they combo off one another to score you the most points possible.

Some nice extras were added to complicate that decision making, such as public goals (making certain tiles more valuable), private goals which differentiate what each player is most interested in, and bonuses that trigger when you complete rooms of your castle.

Also, makes good use of a pseudo "I split, you choose" mechanism, where the start player gets to set the prices of all the rooms, but is the last player to buy.  All payments are made to the start player, so he wants to entice people into paying for the high priced tiles, while getting the tile he wanted for as cheap as possible.

Overall, just a good solid game.

RATING: 7
Castles of Mad King Ludwig is the latest effort from designer Ted Alspach and publisher Bezier Games. Here, players compete to build the single castle most admired by the titular mad king, purchasing and then arranging variously shaped rooms and corridors to create a synergetic whole.

Alspach is perhaps best known to board game geeks for his 2012 hit Suburbia (though I am personally fond of last year’s One Night Ultimate Werewolf). As a design, Castles appears to be very much in the same vein as Suburbia, and I suspect both will appeal to a similar audience. However, the gamers I played with uniformly considered Castles to be the better design, and I must admit that I fell in love with this game despite my actively avoiding Suburbia just a few years earlier.

For a prototype, the gameplay of Castles was amazingly polished, and it would not surprise me if very little changes between now and its publication (which I believe is scheduled for Essen). Each round begins with an auction-like mechanic, in which the round’s “master builder” sets the prices of the available rooms. Players then purchase these rooms from the master builder (paying him/her directly), meaning that careful attention to the needs and capabilities of other players is crucial to good play during the price-setting phase. Players then add those rooms to their existing castles, attempting (and usually failing) to configure the Tetris-like shapes in a logical and beneficial manner. The rooms each provide individual benefits, as well as synergy bonuses or penalties based on adjacency to other room types. Although all players share a number of common goals each game, players can also accumulate individual goal cards, so players’ incentives tend to quickly and dramatically diverge. It was a personal treat to watch each castle unfold, and Ted has invested considerable work into making each tile unique and frequently playful.

The playing time ran just about 90 minutes with four players, and the combination of some healthy (read: non-destructive) interaction with Euro-friendly individual player-board optimization leads me to expect big things for the finished game. Having not played Suburbia, the comparison that initially came to my mind was Princes of Florence (though Castles is almost certainly less cutthroat, even with experienced players), a classic design that strikes a very similar balance. All-in-all, Castles of Mad King Ludwig should be yet another instant purchase for me upon release, and, due to its accessibility and smooth play, will likely see more table time in 2015 than any of the other games I tried at the Gathering.

One of my most popular games with non-gamers. It's always enjoyable to see the crazy castles take shape over the course of the games. The master builder auction is a nice twist on the traditional tile-laying game. Really love the different objectives each game on top of the secret goals that each player has to create a unique experience every time. Best with 3 or 4. Still good with 2 but plays differently since only less than half of the tiles with come out.

I love the crazy layouts as the game progresses.

The master builder mechanism is neat, but, as with any auction, one bad auction can tilt the game. Patricia overpaid for a building she wanted, and then was broke the rest of the game. Aeris ran away with it.

I'm split between thinking the game is too fiddly and long, and not having enough pieces to make a big castle. Sometimes, I just want to build more...

I also have the iOS app, but I haven't played it much. It misses the tactile feel of the board game, but removes all the setup fiddliness.

RATING: 6
While I prefer building my castle to building my city in Suburbia, I prefer the automatic ordering of the Suburbia market to the Castles market. The Castle looks cooler than the city, way cooler. That's a big plus. It doesn't have the cool factor of building a city mind, but it makes up for that with having far less must track but difficult to do so information. On the other hand, Suburbia's market is fast. It lets you get to the cool part of the game, building, quickly. Castle's market, if you were to take it seriously, would require you to look at everyone's money on hand, their open slots (in terms of space available as well as bonuses) and what cards you think they have for scoring. Which is boring. Very boring. And long. And solo play while everyone stares at you wishing you'd get on with it. If you don't take it seriously, it makes the game very random and the winner will likely be determine by a bad ordering more than any skillful decisions they made.

Love it. Simple and well-paced, with a ton of agonizing decisions and tension around the Master Builder mechanic (i.e., how can I maximize dicking over my friends while not having it backfire spectacularly?) Room completion bonuses also give the game the little extra strategical oomph it needs. Changing goals (both secret and open!) and tile randomization make for good replay value.

I think this is actually best as a two player game. With more players, it's fairly impossible to keep tabs on what everyone wants, so a lot of the tension in the Master Builder mechanic evaporates. With two players things feel much more cutthroat and calculated. With more, this drops down to like a 7 for me.

My only real complaint is... I sort of wish the game were longer? In minutes this game lasts about my ideal length, but for once I think it would have been a better emotional experience if it were just a little bit longer. As it is, the game tends to end and I feel like I've only just begun building the start of the eccentric sprawling castle of my dreams. It always ends up feeling incomplete.

This is one of the few tile laying games I've played where both tile acquisition AND placement are truly interesting, and as such it may just be my new go-to for the genre.

So after playing Suburbia in my local game group, more than one person said, "you have to try Castles of Mad King Ludwig."

Hmm.

Suburbia? CoMKL? Suburbia? CoMKL?  I'm not sure I prefer one over the other yet. Suburbia is more streamlined in turn order, but is also more fiddly for scoring. CoMKL has that great auction mechanic... but I'm not sure how it plays with two.

I might keep both. It depends on whether or not my wife likes Suburbia. Neither could likely be fit in a lunch hour, so my work crew is not an option.

The castles you can build definitely are crazy and that adds to the charm of the game for sure as building your castle is a lot of fun. I'm just not sold on the master builder idea as I feel like some players will put too much strategy into it while others will just try to lay it out so they have a chance to get something they need. I think both ways work just fine and can be successful. There is a lot to be add in end game scoring so trying to get extra bonus cards and meet the game objectives feels rather important compared to some of the other bonus actions. I think the game objectives is what will keep this one fresh for me and willing to play again.

It is truly pathetic how Ted Alspach/Bezier Games have sold out, and allowed a far superior version WITH mini-expansion to be released, solely within one country who refuse to ship to anywhere else. That they remain silent, and let someone else produce a far better version of their own game, is rather telling...

As it stands, mechanically a great building title, with an innovative level of player interaction (through the master architect role), and a fantastic amount of replayability (the randomly determined desired attribute and bonus scoring cards). Yet structures never feel 'impressive'... a sinificant shortcoming for a game of this nature.

The production values... that's a different story. Box is ever-so-slightly larger than standard, which is annoying, tile art is bland and pretty dire, lack of insert makes storage tricky, there is so much wasted space inside the box (which could have been half the depth it is comfortably), and the cards (also dull) are paper-thin. I expected much more for the relatively high RRP. The start player token is pretty nifty.

Mechanics rating: 7, production values: 2.

Sequel to Suburbia but with easier scoring and a quirky theme. The addition of the master builder concept where one player sets the price of each available room each round and is paid by the other players for the round sets this apart from its predecessor.

I love this game because there is a competitive factor because you want to win the favor of the King, but sometimes you just get so enveloped in making an awesome castle that you completely forget about the other players! It's a lot of fun for groups of people as well as only 2 player. If you haven't played this game yet, get on it!

This game is similar to Suburbia, which I enjoyed quite a bit.  CoMKL is not a derivative however, it has enough thematic and gameplay difference to feel uniquely different and worthy as it's own standalone game.

I liked the mechanic of the "master builder" rotating each round, where one player is essentially deciding the prices of the available rooms in the market and all other players have to pay him/her.  The game revolves around that central conflict, and allows for secret agendas to score surprise comeback victories towards the end.  

The secret agendas are not too arbitrary either, there are ways to get more of them throughout the game, as well as public agendas that everyone is striving for.  

This gives every player a strong sense of motivation to make goal driven decisions as the game progresses.  It also feels pretty fair, like no one person is going to run away with the game at any time. 

All in all, once the basic rules are learned it's a deep game with lots of replay value, which is exactly what makes it a 10/10 for me

RATING: 10
Fun game! 

Would be better priced at a lower point as it doesn't offer the same production value as other 60$ msrp games (and some 40$ msrpg games). 

The components would be fine if the game were cheaper, but at the 55$ I paid, I definitely cannot shake the feeling that they could've at least given me standard sized cards, thicker main boards that don't stop working after a while, and an actual place to put the components. 

New buyers literally will have to put two separate decks of cards in ziploc bags! They'll get damaged very quickly this way, but Bezier Games doesn't offer buyers ANY alternative out of the box as there's zero storage solution for this game. The game basically damages itself unless the buyer finds a way to keep the components safe inside (or outside) the box. No game publisher should want this - it shows they don't card about their game after it is purchased and in the hands of the consumer.

Very cheap and lazy for such a premium priced game. There's no reason this game should be in this price range. 

If it's going to cut corners, that's fine. The components work and ziploc bags + some 2$ card boxes solve the issues. But this is not a 20-30$ game. It's a premium priced game. Imagine if Galaxy Trucker came without an operating insert, or Lords of Waterdeep (which is cheaper than this)?

The components are workable, but the price should reflect the many cheap corners Bezier Games took with this game components-wise and storage-wise. Paying 60$ for any game and getting hobbit-sized cards just sinks your heart and makes you feel like you should've gotten a FFG or DoW game instead.

But the game is still a lot of fun. Just makes you a little sad that the developer doesn't seem to really care about offering proper component value for the price they are asking. Couldn't they just bump the price down if they didn't want to offer better components? 

It's fine that the cards are tiny and the cardboard is super thin. But when Bezier Games made these component decisions, the price of the game should have gone down as well.

Only game I bought an insert for.....so far. This game is an absolute blast. I think of all the strategy games we play, this one messes with my mind the most. Everyone's information is open (accept secret bonus cards), so you can pretty much pick out exactly what everyone is vying for. So many times I know what tile I would buy if I'm in my opponents seat, but they end up buying a different one revealing a move I never saw on their board. I think this is what keeps me coming back for more. The constant mind game of trying to figure out what your opponent is going for, but not being completely sure because of those secret bonus cards. I give it a nine by itself. If it came with a better insert it's a 10. Setup and teardown is a bear without one.

Shares the weaknesses of "Suburbia" (most notably, the fact that everybody is basically building in isolation). Also shares the many positives - public/private goals, opportunities for clever chaining of synergistic tiles, etc. - while managing to add new pluses.

The best of these changes is to the market. No more simply moving every tile on the market one space to the right; now you have to worry about how the Master Builder is going to rearrange the tiles. If he places a tile in an expensive slot, you'll have to decide it it's worth it to pony up. And if you do pony up, that money goes not to the bank but the the Builder. In other words, you may be empowering your opponent by splurging on a desired tile. That's a clever consideration, and it adds a smidge of player interaction to a gaming system that badly needs it.

I also appreciate the look of the castles when the game ends. The suburbs of "Suburbia" tend to be boring hexagonal mosh pits. But the castles here are asymmetrical and more interesting to look at.

One downer brought on by the transition from the hexagons of "Suburbia" is that the slightest brush will send your castle spinning across the table. Also irritating? The scoreboard is flimsy as heck. Keep tabs on your scores because one bump and you'll have no idea what the scores are.

My Review - https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=uehFJj6WLFo

A wonderfully charming game full with strategy and tough tactical decisions. The master builder mechanic is ingenious and forces you to observe other players strategies so you can charge them more than they want to pay for the tiles they want.

Very therapeutic without any direct conflict, always a joy to play.

My friend once made a pretty empty castle with a set of stairs leading down to a mould room. Pretty unassuming right? Well beyond the mould room was the secret lair, the armory, the bottomless pit and what felt like most of the underground rooms in the game. What can I say, the dude was paranoid :P

Remember Ted Alspach's Suburbia being near the top of my 2012 list? Well, he topped himself here in its spiritual successor. It captures the same building spirit of Suburbia, but focuses it on designing a castle instead of a city. Theme aside, the most noteworthy change is the removal of reputation and income (a very, very fiddly mechanism from Suburbia) with the addition of a master builder who sets the price and gets paid for the individual pieces of the castle. It's a very simple mechanism that adds much more interesting gameplay elements.

I heard this referred to, several times, as Suburbia-lite.  Perhaps a better title would have been This Old Castle, or Flip That Castle, or maybe even Suburbia Lite: Interior Decorating Edition.  Rooms interact with adjacent rooms only.  Unpredictable doorway locations on similar sized tiles bog down gameplay with the eyeballing and measuring and twising & turning of pieces.  No income.  No population.  And not a whole hell of a lot in that giant box.

This game feels very rewarding as you build your own tile castle and see the shape and theme it takes on as the game progresses. The auction phase is a great mechanic, but it can be difficult to figure out how to play it well. A few games I've played had people placing rooms a bit randomly because of this. This game also seems to suffer from turn order. If the person playing before you wants similar rooms to You, it can be very punishing and frustrating.

Building a castle full of zany rooms is a ton of fun.  My only real knock on this game is that I feel like it takes a lot of analysis of everyone's situation to set the market properly.  However, that bogs the game down, and no one wants that.  So you're forced to just make an educated guess and play a little sub-optimally just to keep the game moving.  Sometimes you'll make a poor move that you wouldn't have made if you had put more thought into it.  You just have to realize that and be okay with it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Better than expected. Been a hit with most gamers, across three games. Nice mostly closed money system. Rather than just buying stuff from the bank, like in Suburbia, active player gets to set prices of stuff for everyone at the table for a round (prices don't slide after each item bought), and collect money spent by other players. So you want to price things such that players are willing to pay, but not give them too good of a deal, and finally, still have the thing available that you (the active player) want, priced high enough that it doesn't get bought out from under you by other players (active player chooses last), but isn't more expensive that you're willing to pay.

That's actually the most interesting part to me. Building the physical layout of the castle looks like the core, but feels like a tertiary concern.

It also has a nice balance of public and private goals.

Overall more fun than Suburbia due to slightly less chained reactions that need to be detected and checked. Suburbia remains a great iPad app, but I prefer Castles for putting on the table.

Ever since I saw Rahdo play through this game I knew it was a winner in my book.  I am a succor for expansion/building games.  I love the whimsical theme and chaotic nature of how the rooms combine and the bonus/negative points associated with each room.  The special objective cards are also a nice touch when playing with others.  However, what really makes the great [i]super[/i] great in my book is being able to play it solo.  Every time I have a set of rooms come out that I want/need more than one, but I can only buy one (unless a completed room allows me) and the others go away forever. Very clever! Very fun!

I was unsure if I really needed this game since it was such a clear derivative of Suburbia, but my husband really wanted it, so it became his birthday present. I'm delighted to say it's a strong game in its own right, and perhaps there's a place for both games on our shelf.

The key differences include a combination of public and private goals in constructing your castle. There is also a set limit on the length of the game based on which tiles get chosen, which makes this generally shorter than its predecessor. Lastly, the market setup is decidedly different.

Beautiful to look at and fun to play, I look forward to spending more time watching this game reveal its mysteries.

RATING: 6
Very different feel from Suburbia despite some surface similarities. Other players' castles are only relevant for public-goal competition (less tableau interactivity) but the pricing is human-mediated and paid to another player, which changes everything - it's the centerpiece of the game, the dynamic around which everything else turns. On a pure visual / aesthetic level, the different shapes and colors of rooms give every player's castle a distinctive look. I've always loved mazes and maps, and being able to imagine the building I'm building is really neat.

I'm faintly dissatisfied with the Bonus Cards - they seem a little swingy (some work really well together, some are mutually exclusive) and not terribly thematic - and more than faintly dissatisfied at the "one building per price" constraint. Turns where many rooms seemed of similar utility, people just bought the 1/2/4, giving the MB $7 income and leaving only $6-and-up rooms. Sometimes this happened where all the rooms were equally mediocre, sometimes where they were equally awesome; in both cases, it made the "auction" less interesting and hurt the Master Builder for the following round of turns.

I find it hard to believe the designer didn't try "more than one room may be offered at a given price", so I imagine there must be some reason the game isn't structured that way. It seems like the Master Builder has strong incentive to price things at fair market value (too high and they don't get paid) - though leftover money isn't worth much in final scoring, so you might end up degenerating to "everyone buys only from themself" for the latter portion of the game.

A friend has suggested "the MB may pay $1 to shift a room 1 slot left or right, any number of times". Another possibility is to make leftover cash worth more. I'd like to try both, but haven't gotten it to the table in a while.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.3
Honestly? This game looks ugly and it looks like a bad game but it is really, really good. It really delivers the theme of building a crazy castle. It goes so far as to say "in my castle we would watch movies and then go get something to eat and then we might go down the hall through the pumpkin patch to pet the horses." See that was my town. In Cara's town at the same very point all there was was stairs leading to an underground bedroom, a mushroom growing room, and a place called the hole with shackles on the walls. What this does is add necessary fun banter by allowing players to tell a fantasy story about their stuff. In Innovation I ask myself sometimes what do my people know and who are they? I like the fantasy story, not just the game mechanics. I get a richer experience from overplaying the game because I value what more casual lighter weight gamers value, regardless if I get bored with the lack of mechanics or levers to play with in those light weight games. In Castles of Mad King Ludwig though it doesn't feel like creating the story is me forcing it onto the game as much as it does as when I make Innovation do that. 

All of that said I also value artwork and at least 70% of this game looks like prison walls. I look at a lot of it and wonder why a better, busier artist was not hired. I do not feel like looking at so much space of gray bricks. Maybe that is what made King Ludwig go crazy. You don't have to make them colored bricks but can they not have some weathered shading of brown or some moss growing? Also the room layouts do not look good in photos, but play well and deliver the theme. The title plus the look of the game makes it sound like Kickstarter trash to people that have not played it. After playing it, the title also delivers the theme. 

The absolute busy ap inducing gameplay here on top of all of its pluses? Whew whee this is Ted's masterwork NOT Suburbia. He got even better at making games. It does not play so very light with two players. It plays slow and hard. I will never play this game fast because the little decisions could matter if I am noticing things. Also it has a maybe discover their secret goals nosy Hobbit factor and it really works. It is a huge package for something that was 100% localized in America and inexpensive. It ranks 45 on bgg for very good reasons. Cara gives it a 10. I have to rank it to see what my rating would be, as I determine ratings based on its placement on a pit each against each but only when you are sure enough, rankings list.

I enjoyed my first 2-player game, but am still unsure.  My first impression is that Suburbia is better, but it may be that it will work better with at least 3 players because of how the Master Builder sets the prices each round.  With only 2 players it keeps changing back and forth.  With 3 it would change it up more.

Update: After playing a couple more times (with 3 and 4 players), I enjoyed it more.  I think that once everybody knows the rules and has played a few times, that it will move along quicker and be a fun game.

As of Jan '16 - 7: Fun game. When I was looking to buy a new game, it was between Ludwig or Suburbia because I like building things. I picked Ludwig in the end because of its whimsical theme. Also some reviews of Suburbia was that it was too mathy. I still get the sense of awe watching my castle grow. But I need enough mental energy to play it.

Provisional rating after one play.  The good: it really feels like you are building a castle, albeit with half-drunk architects.  The setup of the market with Master Builder is very good.  The bad:  lots of luck in the tile draw.  Like Suburbia, sometimes it will come to you to take a tile and there are no tiles that fit your engine.  Strong left-right binding.  A weak Master Builder can unfairly help the player to their left.  I would prefer to see a variable player order.  Maybe the turn order could be based on how much you spent the previous turn.  If you got a cheap tile, you go to the back of the line next turn.

After 2 plays:  Even if you get some great combos going, if the tiles you need don't come, tough luck.  I think this makes it a good family game, but players wanting a heavier game will be frustrated.

Light version of suburbia, but nicer to the eye and loveable theme. Also quicker to play which is a big bonus for me. Scratches the same itch in less time. 

Master builder role is also very cool.

Quality of the tiles is a bit disappointing though.

Suburbia + half hour of nothingness as you sit around waiting for the other players to reorder the pieces up for auction
every
single
turn.

If that sounds like fun for you, you'll probably enjoy this.  For me, it was a slow and joyless slog.

Draft weird rooms onto house to combo. Similar to Suburbia. Master picks costs of rooms but picks last. People play master. Must match door to door and must always have an available door. Building the castle is enjoyable and silly and tells a story.

My wife got this for me for Christmas and it's quickly become a family favorite. Lots of options and things to make the game different each time. My wife isn't a huge gamer, but she latched onto this and wanted to play it over and over. It's still in her top 3. 

There is strategy to what you're doing, but it's not overwhelming and you don't have to think too deeply to be competitive. Your strategy will come in what bonus cards you choose (extra points at the end of the game for having certain features in your castle) and what favor tiles are revealed for more endgame points. Obviously, if points are given out for Outdoor rooms, you may want to try for those. There is also some strategy in placing tiles to be purchased. If I see that I'm the only one with a staircase, I know I can put the downstairs room in the cheapest slot. This means everyone has to pay me a little more for the rooms they want and I can pay the cheapest price for the downstairs room I want. Is someone going after a certain room type? You can choose to set the price a bit higher and hope they'll spring the extra cash for it. You also have some strategy on getting more points based on placement in your castle. You CAN agonize over placement if you REALLY want, but generally, it won't make a huge difference.

Really like the game and I'm thinking of getting the expansion in the near future. If you're a fan of games like Carcassonne, Alhambra, or maybe Agricola, you will probably enjoy this game as well.

Nice game with different scoring possibilities (personal scoring objectives, scoring objectives for all players, direct value of rooms and bonuspoints to be gained depending on room interconnection conditions). Completing a room (connecting all entrances to other rooms or corridors or stairs) gives you a bonus action which depends on the type of room you completed. Every game is different because the scoring objectives are variable. Money circulates among the players as they take turns in selling rooms.

One of my favorite games, it is actually simple enough to learn how to play if someone who has played before can teach to others.  The master builder role allowing each player a chance to set prices and get paid for the rooms in play is a very interesting and sometimes difficult challenge.  Knowing what the best room to purchase based off price and the point benefits is always a little mental tug of war that I enjoy.  And of course, the castle building is quite fun, and seeing your "finished" product (even though I always feel like my castle needs to be bigger) is fun at game end.

Start with a foyer - build a castle. I remember being obsessed with home building software as a child - and loved envisioning what the final product would look like. That may be a reason I love this game so much. Shaping the castle, trying to earn bonuses based on meeting objectives - all makes for a great strategy board game night.

I've decided that I like Castles better than Suburbia. The games of Castles tend to be quicker, and you do not have nearly as many potential scores to check with each placement. I thought that allocating value to the buildings at the beginning of each turn would put me off, but that works fine.

Entertaining light tile placement/set collection game. Aim for a close, compact castle to maximise bonus points due to adjacency. Smaller rooms can be completed easier. Only spread out if bonus cards trigger from Activity or Downstairs rooms, minimising Hallways which cost an action but give few points. Don't forget that stairs trigger room completion bonus.(July 2015)

Completing Utility rooms early means extra Bonus Cards and the time to factor them into room selection for the rest of the game. Don't hesitate to over-purchase the round before you're Master Builder. (August 2015)

Falls into the same pits as Suburbia, in that the tiles you plan to get early may not ever be available to you the rest of the game.  Consequently, you can spend the really long game constantly in plan B, C, and D mode.  Too much tactics and not enough strategy, for a game of this length.  And the length is exacerbated by the Master Builder phase, which necessarily requires the game to crash to a halt every round.  Still, I like building with the irregular shapes and sizes.  And I like the streamlined powers that lead to simple calculations.  I would rather play this than Suburbia.

From the same company and designer that brought me Suburbia, this is another winner.  It takes a lot of the mechanisms from Suburbia and refines them into a wonderfully tight, exciting game.  

OK, this is a really good game, but it's just too similar to  Suburbia and I like Suburbia much better. I just don't have the room for games to simply sit on the shelf. Better to sell it to another Geek who will hopefully get a lot more use out of it.

So many ways to score that it actually reduces the importance of your choices throughout. Prone to some extreme swings from things outside your control. Seating order matters way too much, luck of draw with secret scoring cards can swing a game. Overly complicated method of keeping an always up to date score of the game instead of just scoring a castle at the end of the game seems silly. Too many mechanics borrowed from other mediocre games. Just nothing to keep my interest with this game. A personal dud.

Fun game with some good turn angst hoping you can get the tile you want.   I don't think it is as great as the hype but a solid, fun game...that I'd be willing to play quite often.

The downside is that this game requires a lot of table space depending on how your town is built.  And with 4 players, it is easy to butt into one another or butt into the middle where the tiles are stored.

Also, there is not a thing about a mad, angry king...what a tease.  I was hoping for something thematic there.

This game is similar to suburbia but much lighter. It has some of the same mechanisms but without the tile placement depth. Many people say this game is A good introductory game for new players.

I don't know where to start with the issues on this game.

Values are set by guesstimating the willingness to pay of your opponents; and blunders here can beggar the price-setter or hand great tiles away for a pittance.

The bonuses granted for completion of certain rooms can vary substantially, from free turns to very little.

The ability to plan or even hem in the chaos is minimal at best. 

Far from being a "strategy game" this falls into the category of "social exercise with scoring at the end".

truly a "fun" game. some games cultivate fun through the interactions you have with the other players (eg social games like coup/codenames/etc), some do it through the decisions you make (most euros), but ludwig does it through both those avenues as well as through the game itself. it's really rewarding and fulfilling to build your castle, and it's super neat to imagine it as a real structure. this is why i say that the game itself is fun -- not only are the choices deep (enough) and the interaction is well-done, but it's just a fun experience to build your castle. really great stuff, and it has a lot more soul and charm than suburbia.

RATING: 6
I don't like this one quite as much as suburbia.  
Partly that's because it has the same problem as that game, only worse.  Namely, that it feels too short, as though most of the effects in the game aren't going to matter.  Suburbia has an awful lot of buildings that count the things around them and care which types they're placed next to.  But early ones have to be placed next to your board, which doesn't have a type, and later ones aren't going to be filled in around (especially if you use doublers aggressively), a problem which only gets worse if you place borders/lakes.  So, you'll be lucky if you get even 3 residential buildings around your gas station/movie theater/whatever.  But in Castles, [i]every[/i] room cares about its neighbors.  And reciprocal relationships seem rare.  Then you add in the difficulty of placement (which suburbia didn't have, since everything was a hexagon), and trying to get the doors to line up, and the frustration mounts.  I've yet to play a game of this where I didn't feel like I was just slapping rooms together without any real plan.  And even if you do have a plan, it's going to be tough-to-impossible to execute.  You want to close off rooms by adding neighboring rooms with matching doors, but putting together any type of lattice or circle is an uphill battle.  You have no control over what comes out, nor what the other players price things at or buy (more on that later).  So, this unstructured feel fits the theme of the game, but is pretty annoying when you're trying to maximize your points.

The other irritation is the room purchase.  Suburbia's standard queue had its problems.  It was too turn-order dependent, and in a game where money's so tight, too expensive to purchase things up the line.  Castles kills some of those problems, but introduces others.  Now, there's no fixed price for any room.  You can guess, based on the power level & bonuses on offer, what people are likely to buy.  But it's just a guess.  And there really isn't much difference between one room and another, a lot of the time.  Often, players will just snag the cheapest thing available.  Later on, you get info about rooms people have collected, but there always has to be a cheap option and a prohibitively expensive one.  And if things don't go the way you want, you can miss out on your main source of income.  Since there's no carryover from round to round beyond the incentivizing money, the next player in line can undo all your work to keep rooms out of the hands of players who want them.

There's also some swingy-ness in the room types, with many being difficult to close, but the utility ones closing with zero effort and handing out bonus cards worth potentially a lot.  The bonuses themselves vary wildly, with some giving decent points for things you're going to be doing anyway, and others that are hard to do and just not worth it.  The only other type that really stands out is the living rooms, which can score again on closing.  If you devote some effort to it, you can surround a valuable room and score serious points here.

Anyway, with all the chaos going around in the way the tiles come out & are bought, it feels like we're shuffling cards around for an hour, then someone wins.  How?  No idea.  It's currently also suffering from the 'cult-of-the-new'/overplayed syndrome, so it may go up a notch after that wears off.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Great game.  Different from Suburbia and offers a different sort of experience.  I think given a choice I would take Castles over Suburbia but it's very close.  

Suburbia offers an engine building experience to score points which can be extremely rewarding but also more nuanced and tense.  Most common thought is "What city tile can I feasibly place to improve or cash in on my income/reputation engine?"

Meanwhile Ludwig offers up fun factor with tile laying and differing room sizes, bonus actions according to room type, and a simpler scoring consideration.  Most common thought is "What room can I feasibly place to score the most future and present points?"

IMO get Suburbia if you enjoy the theme and like building an engine in your games.  Otherwise go with Castles for ease of scoring and fun!

Good overall mechanic, but some details spoils the efect.

+ many ways for getting VPs
+ setup make plays different from each other
+ gives primal fun of building thing

- needs a lot space on the table (also You can't tell exactly where it will be needed)
- can easily paralyse new players (hard decisions at the beggining of each turn)
- it's easy to loose some bonuse just because You forget about them or even didn't notice right away
- some ideas are fine, but are hard to use them as a part of a plan

I don't see any reason not to count points at the game end.
(Probably You forget to add something during the game anyway.)

2014 Essen has so far been a bit of a disappointment in terms of new Euros, though I am still to play some of the hotness like Caban and Panamax.  But I have been pleasantly taken by The Castles of Mad King Ludwig.  It is a satisfying game to play, even when you play badly as I do.  The building of your castle is just fun, in a way that building with lego is fun.  Having a Mould Room at the bottom of a staircase leading off your Music Room, with an outside Boot Room, an internal Shed and a Toilet next to your Greenhouse...it just feels good creating such a thing.  

The gameplay is smooth and easy, though there is a little bit of Surburbia-style fiddley scoring at times, it is all manageable and the result is a far more satisfying game than Surburbia.   

What keeps it from greatness is that there is something a little less integrated about the way the payment system works.  The Master Builder for the round determines the price of each section of building  and gets paid for each piece by the other players.  It works, but it does slow the game down as the Master Builder can take an age identifying who needs which piece and then calculating how much they think they can get for each piece, how much each person REALLY wants each piece.  In one game we played one player got fed up with that part of the game and randomly put the pieces into the different value boxes, and interestingly he did as well doing that as others did trying to calculate it.  

The game is suited to lighter gamers too.  And I would possibly play a variant with gateway gamers where tiles are drawn at random into the price boxes.  As evidenced in the game we played, it did not make THAT much difference playing that way and it cuts down on almost all of the downtime.  Played this way I reckon the game will last 45 mins for four as you are each only laying around 11 pieces of castle.

Better Suburbia. Organizing castle interior is actually fun. All rooms have thematic significance. It plays well with 2 and 3 players. It's OK with 4. Setup, cleanup and UX maintenance is a little bit fiddly but otherwise the game offers a lot of interesting choices every turn with the result of admiring your creation in the end. As my SO said, it's really enjoyable to play and build and scoring in the end is just a cherry on top.

[b]Favorite mechanism:[/b] Thematic bonuses (or penalties) for each room type, especially the completion bonuses and combos.

If have had rated this 2 years ago it might be a little higher. The main attraction here is you can be creative building your castle layout. The issue i have with it is the arbitrary scoring, as the game from a competitive standpoint is entirely built around maximizing score. You score points for; placing rooms, putting other rooms at all the exits to a room, getting bonuses, hidden objectives, and end game bonus tiles, and your cash. This ends up being needlessly convoluted for a simple tile placement game that feels as though score is just meaningless nonsense than anything 'thematic'. Also it results in players miscalculating their scores and recounting, which slows things down and adds to the tedium.

I have never played Suburbia, and it seems that this game cannot be mentioned without mentioning Suburbia in hand.  So for my part, that's my mention.  On the plus side, you can take this comment as an unbiased opinion without the cloud of Suburbia hanging over its head.

First off, there is a lot of substantial 'nothing' inside the box.  I don't know why they decided to make such a big box for such a compact game, but whatever.

As for the game itself, it's quite fun and engaging.  It's entirely about the "master builder's" choices as optimal placement of rooms becomes obvious depending on how you've originally laid out your first few tiles.  Thus, it becomes a problem accomplishing what you want to do because certain rooms prove to be a rarity among others and chances are someone is going to nab what you want before you can get a chance to do so.  For this reason alone, I would have preferred a bidding mechanic over the master builder setting the prices for rooms, but it's not a dealbreaker by any means.  The end result is that even though you might have a clear plan and direction, you still need to maintain the ability to adapt, to sacrifice certain bonuses to facilitate others, and there's lots of great decisions to be made.

Good game.  I have no idea how it compares to Suburbia.

Nicely done building game.  It's more personal then Suburbia and you get to be a bit more creative, especially because you can stock up on secret mission cards as opposed to Suburbia where you only get two.  Cash flow is harder to manage as you can only really get money by passing on the building phase or as the master builder.  Theme is great and it's surprisingly easy to teach for being such a deep game strategy wise.

Who wouldn’t want to build their own castle?! As Master Builder you try to thwart players from getting the rooms they need to complete bonus goals and maximize profits for yourself. My favorite mechanism is when a player completes a sleeping room, they pick the room tiles that will come out next round. I love this as a way to shape the game, there is no guarantee that what you select will still be available for purchase your next turn, but trying to maneuver it is so much fun!

With two players, I rate this a 6 or 7.   With three or four players it's an eight.  You see a lot more tiles at the higher player counts, giving you more options for acquiring juicy scoring tiles.  The flow of money back and forth in a two player game falls a little flat as well.  

I enjoy the scoring ricochets from tile placement and room completion chain reactions that can occur.  Points, points, points, points, points!

This is a fun tile laying type game. I like that there are some fun and interesting room names and the Master Builder concept is pretty cool.

This is an easy to teach game that takes a lot of proper planning to master. You have to know the pieces well to know how to place them in hopes that the right piece comes out. My only complaint is its difficult to really analyze everyone's castle to know where to place the pieces on the bid chart. I do like the dynamic of paying the architect. It gives a nice screwing people a fun laugh even when you are the victim. I wish there was more player interaction though.

This is a game where players are building castles and trying to earn points through the following ways:

-Public goals
-Private goals
-Placing certain tiles next to other tiles
-The tiles themselves are worth VP
-Focusing on specific types of rooms (for the basement tile scoring)
-Completing rooms with tile placements for special benefits (including straight up scoring)

This also has an offshoot of the "I split, you choose" mechanism.  I say an offshoot because each round a Master Builder actually places tiles on a market of ascending/descending prices. The Master Builder buys last and all purchases by other players go to the Master Builder.  It's really quite clever but will have the potential for major analysis paralysis for people who have to calculate what each tile is potentially worth for each player. These kind of issues usually has more to do with the players than the game, so it's not a huge issue. 

The game graphics for the first North American edition are pretty stark/bland. I have seen pictures of a foreign language edition that looks much better graphically, but I'm not sure if it would hurt the playability of the game. Either way it was something worth noting. For people who like 'seeing what they've created' (ie farms in Caverna/Agricola), this will definitely have a high appeal to those players.

Overall, it's a good game. I haven't played Suburbia at the time of writing this, but I hear they are similar. I think this is the more popular of the two, and Suburbia can be played on iOS, so that's something to be considered as well.

RATING: 4
Loved the first play, hated the second, so/so on the third. To me this game is flawed. Not fundamentally, but still flawed, as:

1. the seating of players has, depending on player experience, a huge impact, meaning that newer players almost assuredly make tile placement mistakes when being the master builder, thereby giving the person sitting next to them a huge advantage. However, this is exactly the kind of game (weight-wise) I'd like to play with inexperienced/new gamers.

2. last game I played had a 16 point swing just because one room card in the deck was not of another type. 16 points is a lot in this game, and in my opinion a game that long shouldn't have such random impact.

Apart from that the game is fine I guess, and I think I'll try it agaion some time, but nothing I'm terribly interested in.

Mildly interesting tile-laying game with many layers of scoring.  Few interesting strategy decisions.  Auction mechanic and hidden scoring bonuses add some variety.  Components slightly unsatisfactory - cards are flimsy, and manufacturer should have used heavy weight linen tiles like those for Carcassonne.  Some icons are very small, making game play more difficult than it should be.  Sometimes the nonsensical placement of rooms can be unsatisfactory, such as the larder next to the vestibule; this also detracts from theme integration. Overall, an acceptable game for occasional play when a light strategy game is wanted.

RATING: 9
Basically uses the Suburbia mode, but much better. Pretty neat how the castle rooms fit together so well while still making you make placement decisions. All the rooms have point options as well as potential completion bonuses. I do guess the auction mechanic can be cumbersome to set up each turn. The game only lasts 10 turns or so. The game seems to be fulfilling without dragging. It kind of fixes the major issue of the secret objectives (and even the revealed ones) in Suburbia being so bad.

Interesting currency flows have always captured my attention, and the Master Builder aspect of Castles does not disappoint, though it does make the game drag on a bit. The way each room type provides a unique completion bonus makes each decision multi-layered and allows for a bit of future planning. The iconography is quite small, and upkeep is fiddly, but overall Castles a delicious point-salad.

RATING: 7
[1 play] I enjoyed this game, with some reservations.  It was most frequently compared to a game I loathed, Suburbia.  There are indeed similar elements of tile laying and variable public/private goals.  But it does not have the problematic “everything affects everything” aspect of Suburbia, and I found the theme here infinitely more appealing.  You’re building a castle, and since you’re selecting from tiles that emerge randomly from a larger set, your castle will inevitably be a sprawling, deranged piece of improvisational architecture.  

The game has good clear rules and was easy to learn.  Production is good too; the tiles are full of entertaining detail, but the features that matter to gameplay stand out easily. One thing I especially appreciated is that rooms of different size are different shapes.  Square footage of various parts of your castle matters for some of the bonuses, and because size is coded to shape, it’s easy to look around and see what everyone has.  So much better than the countless games where you have a strategic need to know what your opponent is doing on some personal card tableau that you have no hope of being physically able to see.  

The biggest negative, which we swiftly perceived, is that there’s one aspect of the game that has potential to really slow things down.  On each round, the player who’s the master builder gets to deal out new tiles to fill back up to seven, and then gets to arrange those seven tiles any way they like along a fixed pricing spectrum.  When you’re the master builder, you’re going to get paid by other players for the tiles they choose, and you’ll have the chance to buy one yourself last. So ideally you want to think about what the other players are all doing and what everyone needs and how valuable the tiles you have to choose from are likely to be to different people, and then set prices so that the stuff others need is expensive and you make a bunch of money, and so that the thing you want yourself is still available but at a good price.  You can see how this is a complex decision and could make things drag.  

Other games this was similar to: 
Vinci for the “stuff you pass over becomes worth more” mechanic, here expressed in that at the end of each round, the tiles not taken get some money added to them.  Even a tile that nobody is excited about will eventually accumulate money until someone wants it. 
Modern Art for the way the players all make money by selling their stuff to each other. The economy isn’t completely closed, though. The master builder pays the bank, and there’s one kind of room that generates cash bonuses from the bank.  
Vegas Showdown for the tile laying element; it’s not within a constricted space as in VS, but like VS it has rooms linked up with doorways, and even more than in VS the relationship of what’s connected to what matters.  
Vegas Showdown even more for the tile selection:  to refill tiles, you deal cards from a deck and each card indicates a size/shape of tile.  Unlike VS the cards don’t have a second function, but their tile-picking function is just like VS. 

Would I play this again?  Certainly, and I’m likely to.  I don’t know whether it will rise or fall in my esteem when I play it some more, but I would be at least initially happy to do so.  There was exactly one copy of the game at our con, and it was totally the hotness; it barely got back in the box some days because as soon as one game finished, there’d be another table of people queued up to play it.

Prefer our house rules where all players work on 1 shared castle; the secret goal cards are face up and scored throughout the game (except the 'most' cards).

I'm very excited about this game after my first play through. The best element is the many methods, both common and hidden, through which a player may score points. I prefer games that allow players to pursue different strategies and still succeed.

I also enjoy the end results, with wildly different "mad" castle designs. I've always enjoyed looking at the aftermath of a drive to score points and seeing just what sort of castle/city/space empire I've built.

I may rate this higher after more plays, but so far I've found no drawbacks. It's a great game!

Suburbia v2.0 (also lighter than the original).  The new mechanic of Master Builder changing prices ("I'll cut the cake and you pick the slice") can be AP inducing; the economy also doesn't work that great with just two players, because you can math it out, best with four players (also because of auctions).  Components are average and a bit fiddly.

RATING: 6
Like Suburbia, you're laying tiles down for combinatorial benefits, and I found reasonable fun here watching my castle grow and deciding which direction – literally and figuratively – to go. The game pulls you on the dual axes of your secret endgame VP cards as well as the room completion benefit. That is, when you complete a room, you get a bennie for the type of room it is such as take another turn, get another endgame VP card, etc. Placing adjacent to other rooms may confer a benefit or suffer a penalty; no surprises here. 

Each turn the start player (Master Builder) decides how to order the buildings in the low-to-high pricing row. Leftover buildings from previous turns get a $1 subsidy placed on them which accumulate. The conceit of the game is that the MB receives the money paid by the other players, and since there is no income phase, you rely on this element to keep your cash flow flowing flowingly. You gotta work for your money in this phase.

The weakest part of the game is in how long it might take the current start player to order the building prices. As the game goes on, those considerations get more important and the play can get held up in periods of AP as the MB needs to ensure they’re not giving anybody any cheap points and they're getting themselves as much money as they can.

Complicating matters is even if players take care in how they price buildings, players accumulate more secret goals during the game often rendering those decisions null anyway. I’d much prefer that the auction just happened (or the MB got to swap just two) and players just got on with it.

I love, love, love:
- the artwork
- the sense of humor about the king's over-the-top castles
- the decision-filled construction planning
- the pretty and nonsensical castle I end up with at the end of the game

I dislike:
- the many "hidden" points--you also get points for rooms that came from now-empty piles at the end of the game and from having extra money left over!
- how much I end up disliking the other master builders

Final verdict: It's a cute tile-laying game 1) with a theme that seems tacked on after the mechanisms were designed and 2) has most of the scoring gains happening after the game is over. I dislike the latter especially because throughout the game, I see myself getting not-very-many points, but once the game is over, I'm suddenly up another 30, which leaves me with the strangest feeling because it's sudden, kinda extreme, and befuddling. I much more prefer a game where I'm making a lot of point gains throughout, and then at the end, I get just a few more to edge out my opponents rather than getting 20-some points during the game, then all of a sudden 30 more points after the game is over. Right?

Pretty Fun tile placement game but no where near as good as Alhambra. Only played 2 player so far. Think it might be even better with more players because more money passes around to the table and makes the bidding placement of tiles more important and complex for the master builder (although I could see some serious AP setting in and really slowing this game down).  Major issue I have is that the rules (much like Ted Alspachs other game Suburbia).  The order of rules presentation is fine, my issue is in the ambiguity on how to apply some of the room scoring and adjacency rules, the language is just vague enough in some instances to leave room for interpretation.  Biggest issue is how unclear basement room scoring is worded.  This game would rank a bit higher if me and my wife stopped having questions we need to search for every time we play.

Very interesting game. You are building a castle with cardboard rooms. The room tiles are smaller than I expected they would be but it works well because they can sprawl all over the table, especially if you build lots of hallways. The game works well, but I'm not so keen on the master builder rearranging all the current rooms according as they see fit. However if this were changed the way income is gained would have to be changed also. I really like the game and plan to get it at some point. I think there is room in my collection for this and Suburbia because they are different enough.

This is a great game. The Master Builder phase isn't as scary as I thought. I didn't spend a whole lot of time worrying about what everybody else was looking for (which was a surprise when they paid a huge asking price for a tile I'd wanted for myself, but at least I got 10k for it) because it was too hard to figure out what three other players wanted.

I find the game most fun and strategic at two players, where you are able to really watch what your opponent is doing and price rooms accordingly.  My only complaint is that the rules as written include too few tiles in the two player game - at 11 tiles per player, and many tiles outright removed, you can unknowingly pursue an impossible strategy because the tiles simply aren't in the game.  When played with 26, or even 33 tiles, I find that the two player game is a lot more fair and balanced.

A variant on Suburbia (which left me cold). In Mad Ling, I liekd the pricing mechanism to control opponents' choices, but it's another multi-player solitaire with precious little inter-action. I was OK playing it, I'd play it again but it's just not my kind of thang.

Next.

I didn't care for this game much until after a few plays but now I really enjoy it. The bidding for rooms makes for an interesting mini game and trying to lay the tiles strategically for the most points is also fun.

I like the puzzle aspect of this tile game, and very much enjoyed the play. The hidden goal cards are undersized, but thankfully type was large.  I wish the tiles were more attractive.  But more importantly I feel the symbols on the tiles are too small.  Had a hard time noticing a bar that was/or wasn't there, which was important to placement & scoring.  Because symbols are small, hard to see other's boards easily to know how to block or make acquiring their tiles difficult or expensive.  That said, would like to own this game.

RATING: 10
Players develop castles with different types of rooms  depending what is flavour of the month with the King (what bonus cards are on offer).  Each player takes it in turn to set the price of the rooms.  For two to four players and it works very well with any of these numbers.  
Good for sociable players or families who are happy to play in a semi-co-operative spirit, helping other players to choose which rooms to buy and where to place it in their castle.
The rules leaflet is well written with a lot of amusing flavour text.
The scoring is a little fiddly as players score a couple of VPs for a large range of actions during their turn, and it is best to go slowly and take a benevolent attitude to forgotten VPs.
Perhaps not one for the deeply serious or highly competitive gamer but for the more sociable, a great game.

Almost a perfect 10! This game wins in almost every way. Highly addicting and different every time. Only complaints: as it's been stated before, the lack of a box insert. Make your own using foam board. Second, a lot of times there seems to be a runaway winner. You can predict who will win about half way into the game. Usually, it's the person with the most bonus cards. They get me every time. Buy those utility rooms for the win! 
------------------------------------------------------------
Update: 7-11-16

The more I think about this game, the less I enjoy it. My win percentage is very low. I haven't nailed down the reason, but there isn't any other game I own that I have this much trouble. I guess I can attribute it to bad luck: the way the tiles come out, which bonus cards I'm dealt, or the master builder element altogether. It just always seems I come up short of having a really great game, while other players coast along. I realize I shouldn't complain about my poor strategy in a review, but it does lessen the desire to play when you don't win.  I think I'm going to check out Suburbia instead. Seems a little less luck involved in that one. I really want to keep giving this one a chance, but at the same time I don't.

------------------------------------------------------------
Update: 8/5/16:

After receiving and playing Suburbia, Suburbia is the much better game of the two. I feel like it's more balanced than Castles of MKL. No master builder element to content with, 2-player games feel just the right length (not too short like this game.) For those of you frustrated with this one and haven't tried Suburbia, try that one instead. You may agree with me.

Tile laying but requires strategy. Much more in depth as opposed to Carcassonne. You are creating your castle in the hopes that you will have enough points at the end to win. Drawing more cards helps to expand your point total if you can complete them before the end of the game.

Essentially a Suburbia clone in its base game mechanics and atmosphere (by the same guy, which is why I bought it). Good for when you want to play Suburbia, but don't want to play Suburbia.

Pros:
1) There's enough deviance from the original Suburbia game mechanics that it's its own game. The Master Builder mechanic is a nice touch.

2) It takes a few times reading it to understand Adjacent vs. Connected, but once you've got that down it's basically Suburbia without the headache of many adjustments to your gameboard just from placing 1 tile, while still retaining the fun of planning the placement of your tiles for adjacency bonuses.


Cons:
1) Didn't know this on the first play, but you won't see all of every stack of tile. This has consequences for your Bonus points at the end of the game (I had 2 bonus cards for get 1 of every room type, and 1 of every room size. Didn't get either because 1 wasn't possible, and somebody else took the other). I might house rule this after another couple of plays.


Overall: Good game, worth playing and replaying. I prefer Suburbia, but this is good for a change of pace in your tile placement games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.75
Finally I have this very fun game in my collection. The Master Builder mechanic is fabulously implemented allowing for many strategic decisions. The tile placement is engaging since there's a lot of things to consider when buying and placing the different rooms (when and what to buy, how much money is worth to me each tile, where do I  place it, which orientation fits better with my overall building plans, etc.). The pace of the game is really fluid and friendly...  definitely a great experience, so much fun, but very rich and varied from a strategic point of view at the same time. 

I simply love this game, it's a truly gem!

I was one of the eager pre-orders for this game :) This is one we bring out often as, let's face it, who doesn't want to build their own castle. Easy to be lured into buying rooms for their own sake rather than for their point potential.

We've always played 2 players with 33 cards as we always found that we were just getting started with 22.

RATING: 7
A Suburbia tervezőjének új játéka, ami első ránézésre sokban hasonlít az elődre, csak itt nem várost építünk, hanem egy kastélyt. Nem uncsi hexákat pakolgatunk, hanem különféle méretű és formájú termeket, folyosókat, kerteket.
Nagyon röviden a játékmenet.
- minden körben van egy master builder, aki feltölti a szobakínálatot, valamint megmondja, hogy melyik szoba mibe kerüljön.
- ezután a többi játékos mindegyike vesz egy szobát, annak árát - most jön a csavar! - a master buldernek kifizetve.
- végül a master bulder is vesz valamit a maradékból, a banknak fizetve.

A szobák lerakása hasonló, mint a suburbiában a városrészeké. Minden szoba ad valami bónuszt, illetve hatása lehet a vele szomszédos szobákra. Pl. egy táncterem ad jó sok pontot önmagában, de elég sok mínusz jár érte, ha egy hálót építünk mellé.
Ami újdonság még, hogy külön bónusz jár egy-egy szoba "befejezéséért", ami nem más, mint az, hogy minden létező ki/bejáratát lezártuk márik szobákkal.

Azt gondoltam elsőre, hogy minek kiadni ugyanazt a játékot más tematikával, de tévedtem. Ebben a játékban máshol vannak a hangúlyok, mint az elődben. Ez leginkább a master bulderes beárazós mechanizmusnak köszönhető, ami legalább olyan fontos, mint maga az építgetés. Mérlegelned kell, hogy mi kell neked, mi kell az ellenfeleknek. Szeretnél minél több pénzt kiszedni a többiekből, de az se jó, ha minden jó cucc elérhetetlenül drága, mert akkor elviszik a kicsit rosszabbat olcsón és nem kapsz elég pénzt. Nomeg mit csinálj azzal a szobával ami neked kéne nagyon? Tedd olcsóvá, de akkor elviszik előled. Legyen drága, de akkor neked is sokat kell fizetni érte. Nem egyszerű. Ez a rész a san marco "én felezek-te választasz" részére hasonlít a leginkább. Sajnos ugyanazokkal a kihívásokkal is küzd, nagyon sok a paraméter, sokat lehet gondolkodni rajta, de nem érdemes, mert a többiek elunják magukat. AP-sekkel ne játssz ilyet!

A hangulata szerintem jobb, mint a suburbiának. Nagyon viccesek a szobák, lehet mulatni az elkészült művön, ami itt sokkal látványosabb is köszönhetően a különböző alakú termeknek. Ez mondjuk egy kicsit hátrány is, mert nem mindig teljesen egyértelmű, hogy mi mivel ér össze, mi hol fér még el. Nagyon precízen kell pakolgatni.

Nagy bajban lennék, ha valaki megkérdezné, hogy melyiket választanám magamnak. Mindkettő tetszik, de másért. A suburbia kombósabb, sokkal több az egymásra hatás, de szárazabb, kevésbé látványos. Mad Ludwigban több a móka és az osztogatós rész is nagyon szellemes.

Nálam egy játék után 7.5, kéne. 

--------
Egy kicsit frissíteném a véleményemet: szerintem 4 játékossal nem annyira jó a játék, így inkább három főnek ajánlott csak. Négyesben már olyan sok paramétert kell figyelembe venni az osztogatásnál, hogy vagy letojod az egészet és gyorsan szétpakolod valahogy - kockáztatva, hogy valakinek kint hagysz valami nagyon jót - vagy 5 percig, orrvérzésig gondolkodsz, ami a többieknek unalmas, és neked se pihentető és élvezetes annyira.
Szóval én azt mondom, hogy ha négyen vagytok, akkor inkább suburbia.

RATING: 6
Conceptually and mechanically, Castles of Mad King Ludwig is pretty closely related to its "predecessor" Suburbia. Players draft building parts in order to score combinatorial or topological bonuses while shooting for several secret and/or shared public goals at the same time.

Ludwig is the more free-form of the two games, swapping the hex grid approach of Suburbia for a much less rigid system of connecting rooms by doorways. Many seem to view this change as Ludwig's biggest improvement over Suburbia but I'd say it's its biggest drawback instead. Suburbia's flow is much better whereas Ludwig is constantly interrupted by the master builder having to readjust prices and people trying to fit the pieces into their abodes. Ludwig provides the better sandbox for people to play in but as a game I'd rather stay with Suburbia.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I like the rooms and the bonuses and everything, it's just so hard to price things appropriately as the Master Builder. Keeping track of what pieces are great for the other players is fairly important and also a big pain in the ass. However, I really like the sense of building a castle and I love how weird some of the rooms are.

My favourite game of 2014!!! This is truly amazing! Lets begin with the box, it's the most beautiful board game box! Then to the game, I love it! Every time you play it(10 times already) it's a new setup with makes the replayability really strong. The game itself is very similar to Suburbia with a few changes. I love both games but in my opinion Castles is a litte bit better and offers more variety. The best game of 2014 in my opinion

A good game with some flaws. 
- Master builder is a big part of the game where one player decide how much buildings should cost. That part is not that much fun. Takes much time to look over what other players have and since they all have hidden agendas too you don´t have all info needed to make choices. 
- Hard to get overview of rooms and get a feeling for what is good the first play. 
- Fiddly puzzling of rooms that is no fun. Will this fit here?
- No real feeling of the theme. Just take tiles that give the most VP and most advantages.

Very much enjoy the bidding mechanism. I've found the game can break down if one player is particularly bad at evaluating the value of tiles, both for paying others and for correctly costing the tiles when they are the master builder. Benefits from a relatively short play time once people are experienced with it.

Not one of my personal favourites, but will stay in my collection due to good experiences with parents.

Probably my top game of 2014, a very thematic tile building game.

I like the replay-ability of this game a lot with all the different tiles, Kings favors, bonus cards.

The master builder is a cool new mechanic. Building up your castle can be very statisfying when you get the rooms to just fit perfectly. Other times you just have crazy looking castles that make no sense. Or you get some nice thematic setups with like the laundry room and washroom next to the sleeping quarter.

Dropping this game down a bit, I still enjoy it a lot but the expansion didn't add anything of value.

I've really enjoyed every session I've played of this game, even though I don't think I've won once, or even come close.

On the one hand, building your castle is a joy and the end result is just so satisfying to behold.

On the other hand, playing to win requires you to compromise your architectural vision and often leads to a compromised castle design.

WHO CARES? This is one of the only games I've ever played where the outcome of a given session has not affected my mood at all. Win or lose, I am a happy man, over here in the corner, admiring my little castle.

For folks who aren't scrubs like myself, this is a much more competitive game than Suburbia, which I think suffers too greatly from runaway leader syndrome.

The gameplay is excellent. I like the master builder roll and the favor tiles really change up the different play throughs of the game. 

However, the production quality leaves a lot to be desired. The art is not very good (art is not supposed to be functional, it is supposed to look good) and the Polish version getting updated art so soon to the release is a slap in the face. Additionally, the cards are the lowest quality cards I have ever touched. Worse than playing cards, almost feels like toilet paper. Finally, there is so much empty space in the box a proper insert could have been made since all the rooms have such varying shapes and sizes.

Won't be purchasing another Bezier product in the future.

By the end of the game you will be crest-fallen at the prospect of tearing down your architectural masterpiece, wanting to build even more monstrous, whimsical designs.

Nothing very orignal in the gameplay of this tile laying game.  Players buy tiles after the start player "cuts the cake slices" so to speak, by placing price tags on the available rooms. You can get bonuses actions or points for completing rooms.  The game feels chaotic as the start player will undoubtedly favor one player over another inadvertently --the prices are just too clumsy (low are too low, high are too high except perhaps on the last turn). As a light tile-laying game, however, it works fine --it only becomes chaotic when competing heavily for score. 

Played again and increased rating slightly.  If you accept this game for what it is and just enjoy your castle building puzzle, it's fine.

So, I have mixed feelings about this game. What I like:  Building the castles is really fun, and while it is not a competitive strategy, I do enjoy trying to make my castle pretty and functional.

That said, the point scoring is a bit boring. About halfway through the game, I start to get a little bored with it... so many room choices, so many incomplete rooms, and it gets tedious to have to choose the highest point scorer among the options available...and then there's the sense of randomness of those choices. You are not really building an engine here. I think that's what I dislike most. Each round is a distinct opportunity to simply get the most points in that round. That means there's no long range planning and it also means that you are basically doing the same thing over and over, and there really isn't that much going on in the game.  

I think the theme is what saves the game and makes it fun. It's FUN to build the castles.

Update:  After playing the game a few times, here's what I think. If I just focus on the aesthetics of building my castle and trying to make it pretty, and don't worry about winning, then I enjoy this game. If I angst over every choice and do endless calculations in in effort to maximize points and win, then I don't enjoy this game. So this may be a first for me: a game I enjoy more when I'm not trying to win.

This game has an interesting variety of rooms you can use to build your castle, with the pricing mechanic allowing a bit of indirect interaction between the players. Its main downside is that calculating scoring can be a little fiddly with the ways rooms can interact with one another.

Tiny pieces, cramped artwork, and fiddly rules make this rework of the excellent Suburbia a chore. The central board is even a little ugly and it makes one think of cardboard instead of immersion. It's a shame because the castle-building part is enjoyable.

For as much as it's like Suburbia, it feels different enough to me that I don't really think about them together.  Obviously you have to compare them, and I think Suburbia is a more strategic game, where this feels more streamlined.  A lot less math in this one, which I'm sure appeals to people.

The main thing that I like about this, vs Suburbia, is it's just less fiddly.  No moving counters, or anything like that.  What I like about Suburbia that is lacking in this is the "plan" aspect, and really looking ahead and planning out how you are going to construct your suburb.  I think you often have to just make the best choice with what is in front of you in this game.  You don't have to temper growing too fast, maintaining cash flow, etc.  

I like it.  I liked it enough to buy it even though I already have Suburbia.  I think it feels "lighter" than Suburbia, and more apt to get non-gamers into.

UPDATE FOR SECRETS EXPANSION:

The expansion is okay.  Sort of an instabuy for me just because of how much CMKL got the the table, but it didn't do a ton for me.  I liked that it didn't feel like I was playing a totally different game.  You definitely have to think about whether people are going to trade the swans in for cash when you price stuff, but I don't know that it added enough to the game to really make me say you need to play with it.  The extra tiles are great, but I could do without the moats.  Just sort of okay in my opinion.

Played 2p twice, played the room completion wrong both times.  A door into a wall of an adjacent room prevents that room from ever being completed.  Whoops.  So far, still a really good game.  Not too heavy, but still moments of thinky.  Good fun.

UPDATE: meh. Most of the game is in the pricing and the floor plan isn't nearly as much fun as we hoped. Having to continuously remember to recheck for room scoring bonuses based on other rooms every turn got tedious. This one doesn't excite us and we traded it away. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Surprised this is rated so highly. Played like an overly complicated version of Isle of Skye. When setting prices/placing tiles in Isle of Skye, you have 4 things to keep track of in a round (current scoring conditions and the end game scrolls), and maybe if the scoring conditions for the other rounds. In Castles, you have at minimum 7 and usually more scoring conditions to keep track of each time you place a room. I don't think adding those extra options brings anything to the game but instead slows it down as you have to consider. Isle of Skye does a better job of making the price setting/market experience feel more exciting too.

I also had big hopes for the theme of this game as everyone talks about how whacky and nice it was. Maybe it's just a product of being produced in 2014 compared to now, but to me it was equally as bland as anything else. The names of some of the rooms were funny ("Mold Room" - where my crazed kingdom stored all its mold), but not any more than the premise of Isle of Skye being building a whisky empire. 

So, clearly I have a preference for the more streamlined, more interactive, more emotional Isle of Skye. This was fun enough to play but it still loses out.

This feels less mathematical than Suburbia, more surprising, and has a more amiable personality. There is probably less opportunity for planning in Castles, where most decisions are made on the fly. But this is compensated by the wonderful system wherein each player in turn gets to arrange the tile market and collect the proceeds. I also enjoy the odd contortions that emerge from the variety of tile sizes and shapes.

Players who don't like this spatial element probably won't enjoy the game. Players who don't like games about making the best of a bad/random situation should also steer clear. The luck of the draw is high here, although there are a lot of opportunities to generate your own serendipity by staying flexible and not playing yourself into a corner (literally).

Fantastic game, love the idea of building my own crazy castle. The 'auction' mechanic is tense and will often lead to analysis paralysis. But that's also what makes this such a fun game. Figuring own how to price the different tiles so you don't go broke, don't give your opponents what they want for cheap and also get that one tile back that you yourself really need.

Only complaint is that the game lacks in insert so setup can take a while when everything is stored in bags.

Castles is a lot of fun, one of those games that changes markedly when you have 2, 3, or 4 players going at it. I find that the setup is not as daunting as I was dreading when I bought the game. And the mechanics make it quite a breezy and fun experience.

Fine tile-laying game where each player builds their own castle. The various shapes and sizes add some novelty, but they don't make much of a difference in the end. You make some small combos here and there, try to complete rooms (connecting all doors) and compete for the king's favors (majority bonuses), but there isn't much room for clever moves. Also, every round, one player sets the prices of all available tiles, which is not particularly interesting and severely slows down the pace. And luck of the draw is too high for the amount of thinking required.

Opinió després de una lectura de regles: similar al Suburbia, una mica millor crec... La oferta de losetas no surt una darrere l'altre, si no que el jugador inicial les coloca com vol (i ell és l'últim en agafar), similar al Piece o'Cake. Hi han cartes d'objectius de final de partida i cada loseta té un bonus especial en funció de les que hi han al voltant, punts directes i un altre bonus per "completarla" (connectar totes les seves sortides).

No crec que m'agradi massa, té millor pinta que el Suburbia però es molt similar. Moooolt poc temàtic, el tema està totalment enganxat i crec que al final és massa puzzle i sense massa interacció (només la subasta de losetas).

Tile-laying and price setting game with an interesting theme although it's pretty abstract. Trying to decipher how to get more money from other players as the master builder is the most interesting aspect of the game. You always have to work with imperfect information because of the hidden bonus tiles, but still it's possible to try to estimate what each player is willing to pay for certain tiles. It's a bit fiddly (I made an insert which makes the setup a breeze) and keeping track of other players' castles can be a pain because the text and symbols on tiles is small. (12.12.16)

I've cooled a bit on Castles and hence I'm lowering it's rating to 7 (from 8). The pricing can feel, and be, complete guesswork because you can't know other players' bonus tiles. It's rewarding though when you get it right and reap the rewards. The scoring is also super salad-y so teaching the game is a bit of pain even though the basic mechanisms of price setting and tile laying are easy to grasp. (31.8.17)

Each turn is the same, no arc or progression. I made essentially random choices on how to price buildings and I did as well as anyone else - feels like interaction without actually being meaningful. It's short enough that neither of those has enough time to get really annoying.

One of those games where everyone's a bit sad when it ends. The process of building your castle is so absorbing and so immensely fun that almost nobody I have played with yet even glanced at the scores. It doesn't matter if I come in last place, my castle is the coolest. Well, okay, you'll have to cross the basement dungeon to enter the billard room, but that's part of the game's charm. Oh, and we call the backdoor behind the thrones in the throneroom the "assassin's entrance". Because it usually leads outside of the castle.

Good first impression. One player sets the prices for all the tiles, then the other players buy them one at a time, evaluating them based upon several scoring possibilities, some hidden. Setting it up so other players avoid what you want is quite the trick.

Perfect for people who like the feeling of building up something that can tangibly be awed at the end of the game. The master builder mechanic is smart, also, but a lot of the game hinges on it.

Fun game where you get to build your own castle.  This type of experience tends to always be enjoyable to me, win or lose.  And wait, there's more!  You even get to play a fun little quasi-modernized-goa resource allocation game.  That could also lead to lots of metagame style fun and replayability.

When I searched for this title, I saw Castles of Burgundy, which i also rated 7.5.  Realistically Ludwig should be rated much higher than Burgundy.  The point salad is just such a turnoff and I don't think I'll ever play again.  Hopefully this one will actually see the table more, and maybe increase in score over time.

I expected to enjoy this game based on the reviews here on BGG and YouTube.  But we actually found it rather boring.  I can't even say we hated the game, it just wasn't fun.  The icons aren't intuitive, the scoring is a pain to keep track of, the room bonuses don't make much thematic sense.  I thought I would at least enjoy building the castle part, but even that fell flat because the room availability is so random and you only end up putting roughly 10 tiles down before the game is suddenly (and thankfully) over.  
You know a game is not for you when you win and don't care, you just want to put the game up and find something else to do.

RATING: 7.25
Castles of Mad King Ludwig is a reimagining of the Tile laying/City building Suburbia where players build a Castle by combining rooms.

Unlike Suburbia, income is primarily generated from other players during an auction for these rooms, with players taking turns to set prices on the available rooms.

Rooms, like the buildings in Suburbia, appear randomly over time, but their values can increase or decrease over time.

My thoughts: I love the concept, and I am quite fond of Suburbia, even with the luck of the tiles involved in the market- it plays well with any number.

In Castles I find that the game varies more on player count: in a 2-player game, the shorter availability of tiles based on random cards is beginning to annoy. Also, because the income is based on turns as Master Builder or skipping turns altogether, there seems less control over income flow- and accordingly any error in the room valuation process, even one which a player might be blind to, is painful.

This also means that bonuses may not even apply (room type didn't come out, room types not exhausted). All this limits a players ability to stack up points and bonuses, especially considering cash flow with only one other player.

3 players improves that somewhat, giving decent variability in tiles but not quite so random- 75% of tiles will come out, and players get income from two bidders as Master Builder.

In the 4 player game most if not all rooms will come out, and players will have a much more controlled shot at achieving a certain strategy. Of course there is a longer time between income collection rounds, so one must budget accordingly, but adding players to Castles seems to control some of the chaos of budgeting, and provide more alternatives if other players grab up the best rooms.

An expansion, like the one planned in 2015, may add enough tiles to the mix to create more randomness, or add other abilities to raise money or to lure buyers away from some rooms that it increases a Builders chances of slipping their room through the bid at a fair price.

I can't start this as highly as I rate Suburbia, but based on the 3-player and 4-player games I'm rating this a 7.25, for a purely 2-player game I think it would fall to a straight 7. In other words, it is generally somewhat above a standard good game for the 3-4 player counts, but for 2 it falls to a more average rating for me.

The box is very nice, the tiles are a little slender for me, but certainly work. The artwork is good, if not stunning, and like Suburbia there's plenty of extra room in the box for more goodies when expansions come out.

Some nice components. The mechanism of choosing the prices at the start is a real winner.

The suburbia-esque mechanics are good once again.

But when you boil it down this is a rather simplistic game that is incredibly fiddly and very point-click

Overall it's 6.5 and I'm scratching my head trying to figure out how it hot so high in the rankings

This game has a couple things going for it, but ultimately it really falls short of the greatness of Suburbia for me. It's too clunky and not tight enough. I also feel like the balance is off and that player order matters too much. Not one I'd vote to play again but not bad

(06/01/2015) Comment based on one play.

A different twist on the Suburbia building mechanism, where players haphazardly create unique, quirky, and interesting castle layouts from various rooms, hallways, and stairs. The types of rooms come up in a pool randomly, but are priced by the active player from least expensive to most expensive; the rooms are then purchased by the other players with the proceeds going to the active player, and then the active player getting last pick, in a variation of the "I cut, you choose."

Players start out building out their castles from a forum, attaching hallways and adjacent rooms by connecting doorways. Added rooms score a range of VP depending on the specific type of room, then score VP from adjacent rooms depending on compatibility, and then score VP from rooms elsewhere in the castle depending on specific requirements. For example, a bedroom may score 3 VP when placed, but if placed next to a noisy music hall may lose 2 VP. Some rooms are marked underground, where stairs must be placed first before the room can be attached. Rooms don't necessarily need to be placed door-to-door, but through connected hallways. In this manner, a rather haphazard castle layout forms, and at the end of the game bonus points are awarded for four randomly determined public objectives (just like Suburbia). For example, having the most square-shaped rooms, or having the most largest rooms, and so forth. Points are also awarded from hidden bonus cards that players collect throughout the game for building utility rooms.

Similar to Suburbia, the interactions of the various rooms with each other can be daunting at first, but far more manageable. Also, players need not worry about triggering other players' layouts as they do in Suburbia. Still, it is a daunting task to try to optimally price the various rooms, as the active player takes into account what room(s) specific players are interested in, and could pose AP. It turns out that this divide-and-choose mechanism, which happens every turn with every player (as the first-player token moves around the board), generates substantial downtime that can be frustrating to some. Since there are hidden bonus cards and secret motivations, as well as keeping track of the public objectives, is it simply impossible to price every room correctly. As with Suburbia, I frequently reached the point of "I don't care," and arbitrarily assigned prices to the various rooms, just to keep the game moving. Other players would reach similar situations, and thus make suboptimal pricing. Depending on seat position from the active player, this could give the immediate player to the left a substantial VP "gift" because the active player did not consider all of the room interactions. I kept making suboptimal pricing and practically gave the win to the player to my left. Thus, the game can suffer from left-handed player binding.

The game has the potential for interesting combinations, where if a player "completes" a room, by connecting every doorway of the room to some other room or hallway, and ensuring a traceable path to the outside (much like the rooms in Vegas Showdown), the player gets a bonus (be it VP, money, bonus cards, extra turn, etc.) depending on the room type. For example, if a food/dining room is completed, the player gets a second action. If a utility room is completed, they get another hidden bonus card, and so forth. This encourages players to set up rooms in advance for completion, so as to get this bonus which can be very powerful.

I enjoyed this game, which is from the same designer who designed Suburbia, more so because of the interesting combinations and simpler room interactions. However, most in my group did not like the downtime that comes about from the divide-and-choose mechanism. The mechanism is novel and seems essential to the feel of the game, yet it is a source of frustration both from a time and binding standpoint. Perhaps with more plays and familiarity with all of the rooms is essential to speed up the play. As it stands, we wish there had been another way to divvy up the rooms in a more expedient manner. Still, seeing the various castles develop was great fun, and the end game scoring was full of surprises from both the public and secret objectives. It is a "7", for it is far more accessible and playable than Suburbia, but still has some frustrating sharp edges to navigate. We may revisit this one soon.

(08/16/2016) Update after a bunch of unlogged plays. The game has grown on me over the past year, especially due to our coming up with a [thread=1383735]five-player variant[/thread]. For awhile, it was our go-to game whenever we had five players. Somehow, having that fifth player added an additional element of fun, because it was even more nerve-wracking to consider the psychologies of four other players instead of three! Comments abound that it is "better" (read easier and more enjoyable) than Suburbia, because one doesn't have to track the exceptions generated by the other players' tableaus. AP can be a problem when divvying up the rooms, so the group needs to nip such tendencies in the bud early on when learning the game. I'll raise it to an "8", as it is a fun exercise in psychology and building castles!

RATING: 7.5
I have played single on the app and with 4 players on board. And I have to say that both versions of the game are good. The thing is that sometimes it is a bit hard to explain the bonuses of the complete rooms to other players and a bit harder yet to explain the points by connecting rooms and keeping track of the points.
I would recommend a "dummy" round before playing it normal so the person with experience with the game (or at least, the instructions) may guide the other players.

------------

Este juego lo he jugado yo solo en la app y en el tablero con 4 jugadores. El juego es bueno en ambas versiones. El detalle en contra es que a veces resulta un poco complicado explicar los bonos por completar los cuartos a los demás jugadores, y aún un poco más difícil el explicar y llevar el seguimiento de los cuartos y sus conexiones al colocarlos.
A quien quiera jugarlo le recomendaría hacer una jugada de prueba antes de jugarlo bien, de tal forma que la persona con experiencia en el juego (o que al menos que haya leído las instrucciones) pueda guiar a los demás jugadores.

OH GOD THE SIMPLE ART, THE THIN CARDBOARD IT'S ALL SO...  SO...

[i]Perfectly sufficient.[/i]

If the art were busier it'd be harder to suss out the relevant info on each tile; if the card were thicker nothing would shuffle or stack neatly.  Was it done on the cheap?  I dunno—but it all works [i]beautifully[/i].  Nothing in the entire experience—visual, tactile or otherwise—felt "less-than".

[b]After 10 plays:[/b]  7 --> 8  The game gets crazy-tight when played with experienced people who know what they're doing.  Definitely gets the bump when everyone knows how to properly value rooms based on relative player positions, seating order, and ever-morphing groupthink.

Speaking of which, the orginal art is more than sufficient—it's necessary.  To play competitively you need to be able to take in your opponents' castles at a glance from across the table in questionable lighting—[i]how many pink rooms does she have?  How many food rooms are in play, and where?[/i]  And so on.  Doing this without squinting, or asking (which gives the game away), or [i]getting it wrong[/i] is one of the keys to winning.  The original art facilitates this brilliantly.

[microbadge=33713]

I love the meta that the completion reward for Sleeping rooms is the one that grinds the game to an utter halt.  Really puts the "AP" in "nap time".

[microbadge=33713]

If any tile is overpowered, it's stairs.  I mean, when His Highness is drunk, and tottering at the top step, I'm overcome with terrible urges... [i]to drown him in the shallows of Lake Starnberg.[/i]  My boot upon his neck, bubbles obscuring his startled face, the scrabbling hands.  I see these things as clearly as the flagellation I shall subject myself to in The Hole this evening.

Who knew I would find a spatial math Euro so much fun?! It's visually arresting and the theme is spectacular and hilarious.

I enjoy playing the Android app very much as it is a lot quicker and less fiddly than the cardboard version. It's also a bit of a stretch to teach to newcomers. I also hate the boards (plural!) for the tiles to sit on. I sit all of them up on a foam board together and cover it all with a sheet of plexiglass. Nice little remedy.

But I love this game and it's definitely never leaving my collection.

This game inevitably gets compared to Suburbia, but the games only share a common mechanic of tile selection and placement.  I enjoy this one quite a bit as the theme of castle building grabs me over civic planning.  The castles that get constructed are indeed "mad," as room type and function take a back seat to the scoring selections.  It can feel on the short side at times as each castle will only consist of 10 or so rooms, depending on how often you are forced to forgo buying a room and instead get some free coin.  I really like the Master Builder mechanic, which is a take on the "I-split-you-choose" concept.

A nice re-envisioning of Suburbia. This game seems better balanced than its predecessor, there are no wild and wacky building powers to make anything a must have. The system does depend on the players to sensibly value the various rooms for each auction and there is just a little luck in the draw of the bonus cards. Ted Alspach has matured well as a game designer, let's hope this isn't the pinnacle of his career.

This is really addictive. The building aspect of it is really interesting and fun as you try to puzzle out the best way to build out your castle. The auction is DIFFICULT and I like it a lot.

You have to build your castle with the King's desires in mind, you have your own secret objectives in building your castle, and even within the pieces, you have to keep in mind what you build and where you build it because that could determine how many points you receive. It can get overwhelming, but that's what I look for in a game!

Looking at the cheap components and uninteresting artwork, I didn't expect to like this game. Hearing the rules explanation I didn't expect to like this game. But CoMKL really surprised me. It's a very satisfying puzzley game as you try to maximize points while building your castle, and it kept me engaged the entire time. Only downside is the possible swingy nature of the scoring, especially if - as in Puerto Rico - the current Builder player makes a suboptimal play such as charging a low price for a building that scores someone else massive points because they weren't paying attention - unfortunately such moves, and they will happen, tend to punish all players and reward one due to someone's mistake. I suppose it's part of the gameplay, but I think that combined with the poor production quality keep this from going higher in my rating. I'd never turn down a game, but I wouldn't buy it myself.

Neutral - on occasion

Although designed and published by the same guy, it's essentially different from [thing=123260][/thing]. 

On the good side, it adds more light hearted fun by different shapes of tile and the even more simple rules.

However, it lacks the exponential growth feature found in [thing=123260][/thing], which makes it essentially tactical. The result is, the actual value of the tiles are kind of transparent, which makes it possible to evaluate every tile and cause downtime issue.

Played once at a friend's house. The component quality is strong, and designing your own castle is quite fun. There is some entropy in terms of which particular tiles are drawn in each category, and this can foil strategies in unintentional ways at times. However, this is usually not a large problem due the expansive layout your castle can take - unless you are playing paycheck to paycheck with your funds. Easy to learn, fun to play.

A challenging puzzle, attempting to get as many victory points as possible from collecting the right types of rooms and arranging them next to their optimal counterparts. Hidden objectives and your opponents changing the cost of rooms on whim all serve to keep you interested. My biggest quibble with the game is that the theme doesn't shine through as strongly as I'd hoped. Rarely do you stop to consider what the actual rooms are and how they are connected as you are more focussed just on their types. Some bolder artwork and more mechanics that engage with the actual name of the room might evoke a bit more charm out of this decent castle building game.

For me, this has a thematic charm that raises it above other solitaire-ish optimization games. It's just fun to build a castle, and kind of a crazy one at that. 

I much prefer this over Suburbia. Both have a spreadsheety fiddliness I don't care for, less interaction than I like, and more scoring possibilities than I'm capable of optimizing well, but Castles has slightly more streamlined play, and, again, a charming theme.

Really enjoy this game, the master Builder mechanic is a very different way to earn money and set component pricing than I had seen before.
Plays well with new players, not hard to learn and enjoyable to build different castles.

Best tile laying game I've yet to see. I like the master builder, I like the tiles. The heaviness and depth seem just right that, people who prefer heavier or lighter games can play this together. 

One possible negative thus far is that having played it the most out of my friends I keep winning by embarassingly high margins, so experience clearly seems to count a lot in this game.

The reason it stays a ten for me when many others fall from grace is that it keeps being nice and pleasant as well as being an interesting game.

Perfect castle-building game. It can be simple and casual, or deep and highly competitive, but either way, it's lots of fun. The theme glues the combination of mechanics here together and makes it come to life in a way that tickles my insides.

Seriously, I can't overstate this: Castles of Mad King Ludwig is PERFECT.

:thumbsup: aesthetically ancient

An excellent game with it's main mechanism based around the pie-cutting problem that is deeper and less random than Suburbia

2 Players: more strategic than tactical = my preferred way to play
4 Players: more tactical than strategic = analysis paralysis downtime chaos party

I've replaced the coins with poker chips to make it easier to stack tiles on top of them to identify the discount total without obscuring important information of the room and simultaneously making the game less fiddly and tactilely enjoyable.

One minor nitpick about the graphic design is that the symbols distinguishing whether you gain points for connecting a certain room type to another, or adding a certain room type to your castle could be clearer. The upstairs room graphics should read "# of points in white text with a black bold outline(without the castle icon underneath) / symbol for connected to doorway / color and symbol of room type" to signify scoring bonus points for rooms of that type connected to [b][i]this[/i][/b] room. The downstairs room graphics should read "# of points in white text with a black bold outline(without the castle icon underneath) / color and symbol of room type with the castle icon underneath the room type icon" to signify you gain points for each of those room types [b][i]in[/i][/b] your castle.

RATING: 8
Great game.

Having to reconcile different requirements - coming from 3 different sources: common goals, personal goals and bonuses from rooms being closed - when purchasing/placing a part of the castle is superb.  These requirements are often not aligned well (or plain contradictory) or they are tangled with each other or some overlapping requirements are competition to the other set of overlapping requirements etc etc.
The cash is tight, the prices of castle parts change constantly and there are other factors to consider too when expanding your castle...

Tough choices and LOTS of fun.

The similiarity to Suburbia is insignificant and meaningless.  CoMKL is much richer, interesting and exciting. I hate Suburbia and I love Castles of Mad King Ludwig.

EDIT: AVOID the Polish version.
  Nice graphics, but COMPLETELY unreadable.  If you want to play comfortably buy yourself an album on castles and the game in English version.

This is brilliant fun.  For more than a decade, San Marco has been my favorite use of the "brother cuts the brownie, sister picks the piece" mechanic.  This trumps it.  Totally different underlying mechanics, but good fun in a reasonably quick package.

After the third play: Great depth of gameplay for a relatively tiny rule set.  Intuitive for non-gamers, especially once the scoring clicks.  Only downside is a long-ish fiddly set-up.

RATING: 8
Castles of Mad King Ludwig has some resemblance to the designer's Suburbia, but it sacrifices the engine building for a heavier emphasis on tactical and spatial gameplay. And it's a better game for it.

There's much to appreciate here: the cleverness of allowing one player to set the market while allowing others to choose rooms first, the many paths and points combinations that can lead to victory, and the chuckles from the crazy castle layouts players make, to name a few. It's a solid choice for players who want a spatial placement game.

It has some commonalities with Suburbia, which makes sense considering it's the same designer.  I kind of like this one a little better because the scoring seems more straightforward.  Arranging things to buy on the track is a little AP-inducing; that may be the biggest drawback for me.

Pretend to be in the shoes of someone in the 18th century who maybe has been exposed to a little too much mercury and is tasked with building a castle.

The bidding mechanic is great and it's really fun trying to figure out how in the heck you're going to add a piece you just bought to this completely insane castle layout you've got by the end of the game. Make sure you've got some extra space around you as your castle can build in all kinds of fancy directions and having to move your castle to make space can be a bit of a pain.

This hits a lot of my buttons: building, combo scoring, puzzly, and just fun.  Even though there is some "downtime", you need to spend your downtime watching what other people build, so that you can do a better job at setting prices during master builder phase.  I really want to get it to the table more.

My biggest gripe is that this game is so long to setup and tear down with all the baggies.  It screams out for a better organizer, and I hope to get one from Meeple Realty.    This is why I don't get it to the table more often.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (January 2015)

Many friends told me that Castles of Mad King Ludwig is very Suburbia derivative and as I don’t really like Suburbia I did my best to avoid this game. However I’m glad a friend made me play it as I really liked it. Fun theme.

It is true that Castles of Mad King Ludwig shares a lot with Suburbia, the core is the same, however the changes are for the best. I really like that there is a master builder each turn and that he arranges the available rooms as he sees fit, this “I split you choose” like mechanism is amazing, it improves the game a lot for me but it can cause AP, so I think the game is best with 2 or 3 players.

The components are very well done and when you assemble your castle, the rooms look gorgeous on the table. I’m not really a fan of hidden goals because they add a lot of luck that cannot be controlled in this game.

Bottom line, I enjoy Castles of Mad King Ludwig. I want to play again and perhaps I will buy it. For me it is way better than its predecessor Suburbia.

I played Castles of Mad King Ludwig again. This time it was  a boring game. I played with 4 players but I think it is a good 2 player game and an ok 3 player game. With 4 players the downtime for the master builder is excessive.

I’m downgrading its rating because my desire to play the game is rather low. The only really interesting bit is when you are the master builder, after that most decisions are obvious.

Castles of Mad King Ludwig is a cool concept. I liked the idea of setting the price for the building parts and receiving the money from the purchases. When I played the game though the decision making wasn't quite on par with other games. It was good and interesting. I would be willing to play Castles of Mad King Ludwig again, but it just didn't trigger much of anything for me. This was true in both solo and with other people. I can see why others would like the game, but for me it just didn't click.

An evolution of Alspach's Suburbia design.  Mad King has much more enjoyable tiles and a stronger puzzle aspect. I enjoy the auctions and the price setting. However, these changes slow the game down quite a bit more than its predecessor. Also, the bonus cards are VERY important, which leads to big end game scoring, which in general I'm not very fond of in games. Ultimately, the pros and cons balance each other out in these two and I feel equally about them both. Very good games, but not classics.

I'm sticking it at 8.75 for now, until I can play it with 3/4 players.  If it holds up then (and after a few more plays), this will easily bump up to a 9 or even higher.

Well pleased with this one.  Hoping for expansions with more/varied rooms in it.

This is a really enjoyable game in which you get to build a castle. On a turn one player selects the value of the current tiles. They will get paid by the other players. A tile can give points based on its value or based on adjacent rooms. Making all the connections to a room gives a bonus. The tiles are nicely themed so it is fun seeing how your castle turns out.

I enjoyed this game more than Suburbia in almost every respect. The one thing that I missed was the difficulty and pain of moving up the population track and trying to manage your income or money and people. To me, that's what made Suburbia worth playing. Mad King does improve the fiddly bits associated with constantly checking everyone's boards. It also has a very neat thing going on with the master builder which I won't explain here but adds a lot of interesting decisions to the game. These innovations don't compensate for what was removed, I would rather play Suburbia which I rate a 7.

While Suburbia is reglemented by comprehensive building regulations, King Ludwig suspended these regulations and opted for free-form construction. In a variation of the pie-split mechanism, the active player decides on the respective price for each available tile but has the last choice from the offer. The differing shapes and the corridors ensure that no two castles will look the same.
While sufficiently different from Suburbia, both games share enough similarity and fill the same niche that I don't need both. Visually, Suburbia is more appealing and it plays quicker although the administrative part has a higher share. I stay with Suburbia but enjoy King Ludwig as well.

An admirable update to Suburbia that sands off a lot of edges to end up with a much more pleasing result. I really like the way that each room is very thematic. It's also just fun building something, which is such a simple conceit that is often ignored by most games.

I look forward to exploring this one further. I also wish there was a better storage solution.

A well designed game and fun to play. The main gameplay revolves around players taking turns to price different rooms, but then buying last. One part I'm not fond of is that the game has the same problem as Suburbia, where players have to pay attention to room effects in future turns.

[Components]
There's a bit of debate on BGG about component quality. For me, the tiles are fine, as are the cards. It certainly did not detract from any gameplay. What would've been nice would've been an insert of some sort. I also agree that a smaller box could have been used.

Suburbia with castles. I like it, but I think Suburbia might be the better game. In any event, the idea of building your own castle is irresistible.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The Master builder mechanism is a clever twist on San Marco's "I Cut you Choose", and a large part of the game's strategy comes from it. Optimized by the fact that each building is worth a different amount to each player, thanks to all those synergies. The ability to close rooms, and the bonuses they give you, means that you can have different strategies.

Recently replaced by Isle of Skye, which offers 90% of the fun and decision in 50% of the time.

Building castles is certainly fun! It's a little long for such a light game (perhaps suburbia is deeper) but my daughter loved it and it's unlike anything we own...

RATING: 7
Was very excited to own this game and love the mechanics, I'm all about building and I like the complexities of the costing and the social interactions.

My only beef with this game (and the reason it didn't receive 8 stars is that with such a limited number of components it can be relatively easy to grok this game and develop a strategy based on the number of rooms left and what colours they're likely to be.

An expansion would likely give it a new lease of life and it's a great intro game to new Boardgamers so I will likely keep my copy for that purpose.

Had this one in shrink for a long time. Read the instructions and watched some reviews but couldn't understand why everyone loved it so much.  Finally opened it and played it and it is a great game.  Can be prone to AP and sometimes run long but there is lots to think about and really enjoy the master builder mechanism.

Very good Suburbia-like castle creation game. I have Suburbia and this one is easier to grasp, obviously because of cleaner design. If I had to chose between Suburbia and Castles of Mad King Ludwig, I would have chosen this one. If I don't have to choose, I want them both!

This is considerably better than suburbia in my opinion.  Smart design, fun to play, a lot of strategy and cool powers, cool combos. Clean, simple, clever economic system drives this castle building game, it'll never play the same way twice and it'll be part of my collection soon.

RATING: 7
Fun.  Get your fun by building your castle, but unfortunately since many of your opponents' points will come from cards hidden in their hands, you don't have much useful information about how your opponents would value each new room.  This is a shame, as it means (1) the game misses a chance to give the master builder an interesting decision about how to price the rooms, and (2) one's score can jump up just because you drew a goal card that happens to match what you've _already_ built.  Anyway, building your own castle is fun.

I like this game quite well. The game is quick although I don't really like the set up, the I split you choose thing works and different type of tiles look nice put together. My only complaint is the game feels too mathy and the tiles feel repetitive. They just give points for connecting to different ones and I feel there are different and more interesting games out there that feel more like I'm building something unique. Still, I enjoy playing this every once in a while.

2015-12-19 - 7 - Good tile laying game with interesting mechanism of paying to the last player in the round, who chooses the prices of the tiles. This game is prettier (especially Polish edition) and less mathy than Suburbia, but Suburbia is a little bit more deep I think. This one is maybe quicker, but with longer setup. Both are good anyway.

2017-12-04 - 7->6 -  I played again and realized that setting up the prices causes me a huge analysis paralysis. I liked it less, but I think it's a good game anyway that I can play from time to time. I guess I slightly prefer it over Suburbia right now. 3 players is better than 2.

I tend to like puzzly, tableau, tile placing mechanics so found this enjoyable, but there's a nagging disappointment in not being able to achieve the castle you want and the importance of the auction is somewhat counter-thematic. Oddly, not as pretty to look at on the table as the box art and components promise. I feel like I don't need both the Mad King and his distant cousin Suburbia in my collection, and the latter's superior capacity for solo play gives it the edge.

So far Lindsay and I have only played it 2-player. Players try to build the best castle for the king. The game involves bidding and difficult decision making (watch out for Analysis Paralysis).  That being said, it's a really fun game. My biggest (and only) complaint is the setup time is kind of long.

Fun game that has similarities to Suburbia.  However the scoring in this game seems easier and the game itself may play a little quicker.

Certainly I like the theme of Suburbia better.

It got me into the hobby though, and still enjoy it.

OK, so I like spatially interesting games with a nice theme. The downside for me is the fiddlyness of the scoring mechanism and finding the flow isn't especially intuitive, which makes it less of a pleasure to play than I'd love it to be.  Revising this after a few plays - the scoring isn't as fiddly now as at first; whether that's familiarity or poor explanation first time.

RATING: 5.5
Rating after one play (2-player game). On the surface, this game seems simple, but I found the continuous scoring and potential re-scoring of rooms fiddly and a real pain in the butt. It's so easy to miss points (bonuses or penalties) when scoring the different rooms and their effects on other rooms; especially the downstairs rooms. The whole thing just seems like a confusing mess.

This game was clearly inspired by Avalon Hill's Vegas Showdown.  It's as close as I think I've ever seen a highly successful game copy something else.  Of course Vegas Showdown was begging to be copied since it's so unique and not without its design issues.  I do think this game managed to correct most of what I didn't like about Vegas Showdown while keeping everything I did (And it's certainly managed to evolve into something entirely its own at the same time!).  The components are high quality by comparison and the individualized rooms and art detail are superb.  The bonus cards in Vegas Showdown were far too randomized compared to the cards here.  The way money works in Castles of Mad King Ludwig is a bit thematically odd feeling though since you pay your money to the start player which rotates each turn.  I ditched Vegas Showdown years ago despite absolutely loving the building half of the game.  I'm pretty confident Castles of Mad King Ludwig could earn a permanent place in our collection.

Beyond the thematic weirdness of paying money to the current start player vs. the bank my main remaining "minor" issue is in how the start player can rearrange the order and therefore price of the rooms currently up for sale.  It's a very AP prone task made tougher by often limited information as to what to really price how.  Left to little thought it can swing the game pretty good so I cannot help but wonder if it wouldn't have just been a better design to straight out just have unbought titles slide down.  Our last game I only won by 3 points and I cannot help but wonder if that was mostly just due to an opponent NOT spending enough time analyzing and pricing the tiles.  Certainly seems like the weight of game where you would not want to encourage AP in order to win.  That all said I suppose I personally prefer the rules as-is as I'm an experienced enough gamer to decide quickly and it does present another meaningful decision and a bit of "push your luck" in attempting to place the tile or tiles your really after in such a way as they might be left for you yet still as affordable as possible.

This is a very interesting tile placement game that builds a ridiculous and hilarious castle at the end of the game. The bonus mechanism, given when a tile is completed, is very fascinating and fun. Overall, this is a great game and I really want to play more!

Wow, I love this game! I love the castle building aspect. I love the humor in the tiles. I love the game order mechanics and auction strategy aspect. I love to get the bonus when I complete a tile. Each game is too short and thrilling. Each castle I built I found satisfaction.

This game just gets better and better after more plays. I have a feeling that I might be addicted by this game now. Each beginning makes me feeling excited. Each ending makes me feeling satisfied.

Castles is by far my favorite tile-laying game (a type of game I typically find boring). It features cool and quirky rooms you can add to your castle, and a clever "Master Builder" role that allows the players to take turns setting the prices for all the rooms (and hopefully profiting from it). The scoring takes a little getting used to, but once you understand how it works the game is a blast to play. It's not a heavy game, but this game comes out frequently in a group of gamers who love heavy games. It's that good!

Suburbia tylko o budowaniu zamku a nie miasta. Wykonanie wersji polskiej ładniejsze (wspieram.to) spowodowało że gracze w USA mieli pretensje do twórcy i wydawcy że nie ma takiej wersji u nich. Rozwiązali ten problem tak, że nie może wychodzić już ta ładna wersja w ogóle. Dodatek który jest (dodaje fosę i ukryte komnaty) może wyjść po polsku ale tylko w pierwotnej, obskurnej szacie graficznej a i podstawowa gra też może w takiej wyjść. Oczywiście Lacerta (po połączeniu z Planszóweczką) nie ma zamiaru wydawać brzydkiej wersji więc nie będzie wcale dodatku przez najbliższe lata a może i nigdy. Taka sytuacja.

[size=12][b]Why I dislike Castles of Mad King Ludwig:[/b][/size]
- I dislike the master builder mechanic because you do not know what other players want and hence struggle to make a meaningful decision in regards to pricing the tiles. The tile pricing phase also causes the game to go for a longer duration. 
- The artwork for the castle could be better. 
- Suburbia is too similar to this game and Suburbia works better for 2 players.

I'm not a big fan of the "I cut the pie, you choose the slices" mechanism any games, as it always leads to the same problems (of which plenty of downtime is probably the worst). Other than that Castles of Mad King Ludwig is an ok game. The scoring mechanism(s) isn't the most innovative ever, but building the castle is an ok puzzle with some interesting decisions. Graphics are bland and make playing the game more difficult as it isn't always immediately clear which category a tile belongs to.

Suburbia is one of my favourite games and wanted more so I got this. I enjoy how they changed the game from a "strategic long term" to "tactical re-active" game. While Suburbia I think is the superior game, this one seems a lot easier to teach to new players (sort of a gateway Suburbia) and I can see this one actually seeing more table time because of that. Great addition to my collection.

I like building games, but it's hard for me to imagine a game more boring and tedious than this one. 

There is nothing fun about this between the myriad of fussy cardboard tiles and clumsy board pieces, the repeated squinting at a tiny symbols on said tiles, and the heavy "screw your opponent" mechanic to avoiding buying on your non-Master-Builder round. The beginning-of-round room-drafting / re-arranging is dead time. The end-of-round scoring is PAINFUL. 

Seriously: there is not one fun part to this game. I'd honestly rather play War with a deck of cards or wash dishes. Both activities are more entertaining. 

Unrelated to gameplay, a few specific ambiguities in the instructions that seemed like they could have easily been avoided with better editing.

This is more a puzzle than a game. Probably the only gaming aspect is the pricesetting.
I am not sure how the next batch of tiles are chosen yet but it seems there is some luck there in which tiles come up.
Doesn't really matter though. Because of its puzzly nature I don't mind the scores so much. And it is a fun exercice once in while.

edit: played this now irl and I like it more.
I really like the price setting and that you have to pay the other player.

I like this less than Suburbia mainly because it puts the focus solely on points rather than building an engine. It does have some cool twists though and it can definitely stand on its own.

Played this when it first came out, a 4 player games which just did not work for us. Sadly I cannot recall why it did not work but I do recall that no matter what we did one player kept getting benefits whilst the rest of us suffered. Even the winner of the game felt it did not work. I just did not enjoy the game at all. I did write my reasons for disliking the game but cannot find where I wrote it (I thought it was here but obviously not). When I find the proper write up I will replace this.

A good, laid-back purchasing and development game. The game becomes a lot more strategic as more players are included, which I believe makes it a much stronger game; however, the solo version is something that I really haven't explored yet, but really want to so that I can see the changes in strategy.

One of the best 'I deside the price, others choose their tiles first' games I've played. Ugly looking shit and some usability issues as well, but otherwise this is a game which one I enjoy quite much. And what's the best, in this game the "I cut the pie" -mechanism doesn't bring downtime that much which is normalli the biggest issue with this game mechanism. What I don't understand here, is the price: English edition is ridiculous expensive compared to what you get. Luckily I bought used copy and saved 30 euros.

In the tile-laying game Castles of Mad King Ludwig, players are tasked with building an amazing, extravagant castle for King Ludwig II of Bavaria...one room at a time. You see, the King loves castles, having built Neuschwanstein (the castle that inspired the Disney theme park castles) and others, but now he's commissioned you to build the biggest, best castle ever — subject, of course, to his ever-changing whims. Each player acts as a building contractor who is adding rooms to the castle he's building while also selling his services to other players.

Suburbia: The Castle.
- I miss the funny part on the scoring boards
- I don't miss the terrible amounts of accounting in Suburbia
- I really like the fun of the different room shapes and sizes
- The way the available rooms are rearranged every turn is a rather good idea and adds interesting decisions (but also a little AP alert).
Overall, I like it a bit more than Suburbia. Fine little game.

My wife and I (and independently, my brother) "cracked" Suburbia fairly rapidly (in time—still took a couple dozen plays), so we're all hopeful that Ludwig will give us more of the same great feeling Suburbia gave us when it was new but hopefully without the feeling like there's a clear set of dominant tactics. I think the Master Builder mechanic is great, plus it is just tremendous fun building a crazed palace :).

Our favorite medium weight game as a couple. Tile-laying, castle-building - we love it. We tell each other about our castles when we are done and it builds a story up. Unfortunately, we bought the expansion, mixed it in, and found we did not like it. After 2 plays with the expansion, we haven't played it since. Still a game she often requests but the set up time and expansion have lost their luster. It's a game we will get back to table VERY soon and I'll update the comment to say how much we loved it again! We even have the MeepleRealty insert!

A worthwhile successor to Suburbia who did away with the awkward income scheme & crazy cross-player scoring interactions.  The new auction type mechanic is a good addition, the replacing of clean hexes with irregular shapes is sad.  It's as playable than suburbia and has more depth, so I prefer this.

I really like this game.  It's so fun and neat and different.  It's so much less calculational than other games of this weight.  It works so well.  It doesn't have any annoying luck like Suburbia.  The auction is just perfect for letting you manipulate and strategize to get the tiles you want.  Fun choices!  The different ways to get victory points work really well too, and are really fun and variable.  Building a castle is really fun.  It plays in just the right amount of time, with just enough strategy to be really interesting but not so intense I don't want to play often.  The game looks great, the artwork is just perfect; I love how the rooms look!  The perfect game!

I regularly play most of the top ranked board games and this is now definitely in my top 3.  The strategies are always different and it has the right blend of different kinds of skills (visual placement, forward thinking, calculation etc) as well as trying to figure out what other people will do.   Visually it looks great and is about the right length of time to play (the box is pretty accurate at 90 minutes).   My current top recommended games to friends.

Some interesting auction mechanisms, but a bit fiddly and more downtime than a game like this should have. I don't see why you couldn't just buy the rooms in turn order, but fit them simultaneously. It's also a bit fiddly and annoyingly twee in the same mould as the rooms in Caverna.

While this game shares elements with Suburbia, they are more siblings than twins.  The mechanic by which the master builder arranges the market this turn is quite unique and the interactions of the rooms is much easier to track here.  The quest to complete rooms and the irregular geometry of the tiles provide unique challenges as well.  A solid middle-weight Euro.

RATING: 7
Introduction:
Castles (of Mad King Ludwig) is a tile-placement with a unique auctioning mechanic.  The tiles are rooms and are of various shapes and colors/types.  

Players take turns being the "Master Builder," which means determining the price that each piece can be bought for during the next round.  There are several slots for $2000, $4000, $6000, etc, and he chooses which tile will be in each slot.

The Master Builder Arranging the Prices:
This auction is the most interesting part of the game, because players may either pay the Master Builder the price for a tile, OR they may not buy anything and simply take $5000 that turn.  So the Master Builder is trying to arrange tiles so that they will pay a moderate amount, but not too high, or they may just opt out of paying him at all.  Alternately, he could purposefully put something really high because he doesn't want his opponent to have it.  

And, because the Master Builder goes lost, he's also thinking about the tile(s) that he would like to buy--does he put them low so that he doesn't have to pay much (but risks someone else buying it first), or does he put it high and pay a lot, but be relatively assured that no one else will buy it?

There turns out to be a lot of thought that goes into the master builder arranging the auction, and in the end there's no "right" answer, but there are certainly things that can set up an opponent, and things that can set yourself up for success if you're reading the situation correctly.  It really "pays" (har har) to "pay" (oh please stop) attention to what your opponents are going for.  

Bonuses:
Speaking of which, some goals are public (and everyone is competing for them) and some are secret.  I like that they made a variety of goals instead of them all being the same.  You get bonus points not only for obvious things (like have the most orange tiles or have the most 350-size tiles), but more interesting things like: every open entrance in your castle, every round room, every square room, every completed room, every incomplete room, get a TON of points for having one of every room, get a TON of points for having one of every shape of room...etc.

The names of the room are thematic and sometimes humorous--I always get a kick out of "The Mold Room" and "The Bottomless Pit."

BUT HOW DOES PLACING ROOMS IN YOUR CASTLE WORK?
Glad you asked.  Every time your purchase a tile/room, you must attach at least one of its entrances to an entrance of another room.  Then the room gets you points for building it and bonuses (or penalties) based on what rooms it is next to.  These two things are listed on the tiles so it's easy to see what each tile does.

When you make a move that causes each entrance on a room to be connected to another room, then that room is "completed."  Completing a room gets you a reward based on what color of room it is, and all of these rewards are listed on nice cheatsheets that each player has.  Yellow (food) rooms get you an extra turn, purple (living) rooms re-score their points, green (outdoor) rooms get you $10000, etc.

These completion rewards make rooms with only one or two entrances very desirable as they allow you to quickly get those rewards and catapult to the lead.

Pace/downtime:
The game plays in about two hours.  I will warn that some people can be a little AP when they are the MB (master builder).  It's a very different kind of puzzle to solve and it effects people differently.  Some people feel liberated by it and move things very little, taking 5 seconds.  Others feel like it's hard to find the optimal solution (if you could have such a thing) and spend a lot of time creating an ordering, and then going "but I don't want to give THAT away for 2000" and reordering again.  No matter what, you're going to have to give SOMETHING away for 2000!  By and large though, most people enjoy being the master builder and don't take TOO terribly long.

So this game is "ok" on downtime.  It only plays up to 4 and I think that's a good choice.

Components:
Everything is nice solid cardboard.  The cards are quite small but very readable and they take up less space on the board that way, so I'm ok with the fact that they're harder to shuffle.

The box itself is one of the most beautiful boardgame boxes I've ever seen.  Unfortunately there's nothing in the actual game with artwork like that, so I hope no one comes into it expecting that.

One detail that could use work: the cardboard cutouts that hold all the pieces and have the scoring track.  They don't lie perfectly flat, so they are easily moved and I keep ending up fiddling with them.  That's a small negative.

Gameplay:
The MB (master builder) arranging and auctioning is fairly innovative and offers something that no other game has.  Also, figuring out each turn what you're going to buy is a constantly changing little puzzle and I've found it to be very rewarding.  It feels like I ALWAYS have good choices in this game.  If someone takes the tile that I really wanted, there is oftentimes another tile that can still really help me in different ways, and then there is always the hallways and stairways that I could build this turn, and I can always just use my turn to get money!  

So really, I never feel overly constrained with this game.  Also, it has a really good sense of "agency"--I have something to do with everything that goes into my castle.  There is the random luck of what tiles come out on what turn, but I choose how much I'm willing to pay for things and where to put them and which bonuses I'm going to try to score--short-term and long-term.  Furthermore, I as the MB have a say in what my opponents can do.  I really like that too--direct player interaction that doesn't feel nasty but is definitely meaningful and alters the game.

Luck vs Strategy:
I always try to measure the degree to which a game's outcome is determined by luck.  Then I measure how long the game takes to play, and basically, I don't want the first to be higher than the later.  I don't like games that have the outcome largely determined by luck and are also long.  So how does COMKL do in this category?

Well it's really hard to say.  As far as bonuses, I feel like there's a small degree of luck, because the secret bonuses (of which each player starts off with 2 of) seem pretty well-balanced to me, and then if you don't go after the public bonuses at all then that's just your fault--you knew about them the whole game, and there's no way you can say you didn't have a way to do well on at least one of them if you wanted to.

The part that can be more lucky is about which tiles come out at which times.  So if a bunch of good tiles come out and it's your turn to be the MB (so you're going last), then it may seem like you're having bad luck.  On the other hand, by placing those tiles in the right place, you can rack up on money that round.  And on the other other hand, it's not like there are tiles that are strictly better than others--it all depends on what strategies you're going for.

Now, if you're going for the same thing as your opponent and a good tile for that strategy comes out, AND neither of you has any good alternatives out there (which won't be true 90% of the time)...then maybe it really matters on whose turn that tile comes out.  But you're getting points from so many different sources, that I just don't feel like that's a big deal.

One of my friends (that has played this only once) disagree with me--he felt that luck didn't go in his favor because 1) when he was the MB, people "passed" (took $5000 instead of buying from him) several times so he got less money.  2) He felt like the tiles that were available when he was the MB were not as good as ones on other people's turns.

My opinion is that the second complaint has SOME validity if multiple people go after the same types of tiles...and for the public bonuses, that will be true.  But there are always people going after different secret bonuses, and there's always other reasons for getting something--easy to complete, and the type of completion bonus you'll get, and maybe you have a tile that gives you a bonus for putting that type next to it. 

SO...IMO you can always make out OK if you play the game right.  That's just my opinion.

Theme:
I like that this is a tile placement game where the tiles are not all the same shape, and where we're not just putting them in a grid ("thank the Maker!").  I'm not sure how taking the turns being the MB works out thematically, but hey, maybe because Ludwig is mad, he randomly picks different people to be his favorites?

The basic premise of each castle having different things that you get bonuses for makes a lot of sense to me.  And the bonuses that rooms have for being next to other rooms usually feels very thematic and sensible as well.  There's also a rule about outdoors rooms that has to do with not blocking the view--another great little thematic rule.  

And you have real incentives to create a downstairs as well as an upstairs!  Basically, there are a lot of ways in which I think the gameplay/rules themselves feel thematic, and that's the best kind of theme IMO.

I like that the different rooms have some subtle humor to them.  There's a "bottomless pit" room for instance.  Or a "mold room", which they just made up to be funny (there's no such room in history).  And some of them are actually informative, like the Venus Grotto room.

Replayability:
So far I'm not getting tired of it; we'll see how things progress.  The public bonuses and the secret bonuses are randomized every game and that's the biggest thing that's going to make games feel different.  Also the randomness of what rooms come out when really makes every turn feel unique.  Also several little things change based on number of players that give it a little different feel.

It sounds like the expansion for this is REALLY good so that is also a plus; knowing that I can pick that up for only $30-40 and add on lots more mileage if I get tired of it.  So I give this a solid rating for replayability.

Player Interaction:
Like I said I think this has good player interaction; players can only do moves that the MB allowed them to do when he set up the auctioning!  Strong player interaction without it being just "take that"...THANK YOU!

Rulebook:
The rulebook is fine.  There are several little rules to remember and so I've consulted it many times.  It doesn't usually take very long to figure it out however.

Balanced Strategies:
I do feel like the various strategies are balanced here.  And by strategies I mean: the different secret bonus cards, the different public bonuses, the different types of buildings, and trying to maximize income as the MB vs stopping opponents from doing what they want.  And all of these things could be focused on more than the others, and I think that THAT is balanced too!  As far as I can tell at least.

Final thoughts:
Again, I feel this is innovative, original, I feel the mechanics and bonuses are thematic, and I really like the player interaction.  Strategies seem to be balanced and I am fine with the level of luck for how long this game is.

I honestly don't have any major negatives!  All I have are things that are fairly good but not perfect:
1. It's not QUITE as replayable as it could be
2. Fiddly-ness of the score board which moves around because it's not perfectly flat
3. Some people feel it's got a lot of luck
4. Some people suffer from AP when being the MB
5. Some people feel like we're all playing solitaire (again I think there's lots of player interaction with the MB arranging prices)

I guess the main one thing I don't like is: the rules are not elegant.  There are just a lot of little rules to remember and several things to fiddle with every round.  You inevitable forget to add points for something somewhere, because this is a points-salad kind of game.  And there's just so many little rules.  Many of them are kind of intuitive so that helps--but I still had to consult the rulebook many times on my 4th play.

Also, there is no stellar artwork or anything in this game--besides the box cover.

"Should I get this?"
I don't think this is for everyone.  It's a medium-weight game, and I think it will be too heavy for the very light gamers and too random for some of the heavier eurogamers.  But I think it has a wide appeal for everyone not in those two extremes--unless you're in one of those two categories, I think this is a great buy.

Summary & Rating:
This was really hard to decide, because while there aren't any huge negatives, there is also just something lacking in order to make it truly exciting, like this is one of my favorite games of all time.

I like Suburbia more because of one game element: I didn't like that each round the architect must decide the order of the rooms (basically set up prices). This is too much stress and AP. To do this right you must inspect and analyse all castles. I hate being architect.

I liked how it improved on Suburbia in almost every area where I disliked that game. A little worried this game will feel a little too "the same" every time you play it though.

Update: Played with 4 people this time, game was enjoyable, but the lack of interaction outside of being the Master Builder was a bit dull. People seemed to enjoy the stories of their silly castles, but gameplay wise it felt very the same to last time. I had some good cards and did my best to get those tiles when someone didn't buy them first. Never really felt like I had any hard choices which was disappointing.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is similar to Suburbia but with differently shaped tiles, the master builder pricing rather than the gradual reduction in price market, and almost everyone gets some points from the public goals rather than one or none.

I don't think I'm a fan of the master builder mechanic. It seems cool in principle, and is somewhat thematic, but it makes it so players need to be fairly experienced to prevent seat order from giving someone an advantage or disadvantage, as a beginner or unassuming player can make a room great for a person to their left really strong.

The non uniform shape of the rooms adds some tricky placement planning, and you can easily accidentally block off doorways, adding another level of strategy.

There are many ways to score via set collection in the game: public goals, depleting all of a room stack to score 2 points for each of your rooms of that type, colors for adjacent rooms and being able to collect hypothetically a near infinite number of private goals. The rooms that score for non adjacent rooms have the same problem as Suburbia in that it is very easy to forget about them (whether your own or other players when pricing for master builder).

Unless you chain through blue rooms like crazy you use (rough estimate) 60% of the tiles per game, so I think variability is better than Suburbia, but I still wish there were more different ones.

If the artwork was more whimsical instead of somewhat downcast and the master builder mechanic was tweaked to be more balanced with players at different levels I think I would like this game more than Suburbia, but as it stands it only gets a high 7.

I actually find the theme much more engaging than Burb. I also find it, mostly, less chaotic. Smart plays and wise master builder turns can lead to advantage, even if you're not doing well with bonuses. 

What a great evolution of the system.

Building the castle is great, but the heart of the game is in the price setting mechanic.  Making the good rooms JUST on the edge of being 'too expensive' is just great fun, and it becomes super meta when trying to figure out what rooms each player wants.  Big thumbs up for me!

Tile laying games are really fun to me. Most of the time they are really relaxing too. The addition of buying and setting prices for the different rooms make Castles so good. This has become my favorite game, and the expansion secrets just adds to it.

A clever game where you are building a castle with different room types.  Room placement is very important and you can get extra points if rooms of complementary type perform well.  And you can be punished if they opposite.  A bedroom by a loud room is not good.  Each room has different special power.

The game is very similar to Suburbia also by Ted Ansbach.  But I like it a little more than Suburbia since the game is less abstract and there is less remembering that other players actions can trigger points and money for you.  

Excellent and game and very much worth playing and owning.

Trying to find a quick way of explaining to new players all the different aspects of the rules is still a little daunting. Especially so since it's actually very easy to pick up and play, but there are nice varieties of scoring, playing, which make it fun to revisit. Great design, fun dynamic being the master builder and controlling your own cash flow versus allowing players access to hight scoring tiles. We've played this three times in two weeks, and I feel that this game will be a keeper for many more years.

Very similar to Suburbia by the same designer but having a much cooler castle building theme.

This is the only tile building game that I would actively seek to play. Interactive, lots of scoring but each player would face only a limited few, relative short playtime and most importantly, the 'freestyle' building makes this game rank so high.

Initial rating. This game is far superior to Suburbia IMO. The instructions make it seem like there is a lot to remember, but once you sit down to play, it all falls into place. I think the strategy is easier than the randomness of Suburbia and the Master Builder setting prices is a huge improvement over 'time on the market'.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Good things:
1) there is not one obvious strategy that always wins, every game is different and there are many ways to gain points
2) The tiles are really pretty and some funny, it is fun to be the architect of your own castle
3) Strategy, evaluating what the others are planning etc is needed. But in the same time you don't need to focus on what will happen after 10 turns, but you can take one move at the time.
4) Not a game based on luck
5) The single-player works okay too

Bad:
It can be a bit difficult to keep count of the score, but I used a badly translated rulebook (finnish) so I think that was the reason. It became a lot clearer when I looked up the original english one.

Light, but with plenty of depth, and so charming. I do enjoy having an eccentric castle to build and explore and talk about when it's finished.

Two thumbs way up - my new favourite game!

I like it a lot and think it's more interesting than Suburbia.  I love playing with people that don't over think the order of rooms when they're up as master builder - come on, just take a minute and put them out.  No need to spend 20 minutes solving the unsolvable puzzle!  But yeah, as long as you don't have someone holding up the game in that phase it goes along pretty quick and is much less fiddly than Suburbia.  Thematically speaking the income and reputation in Suburbia worked, but moving it up and down all the time, collecting your income, etc. was kind of a pain.  None of that going on in Castles of what's-his-bucket.  You also don't have to look around at everyone's stuff to update your stats.  Anyway - yeah for me it's superior in every way.

I would play this game anytime. It's a solid design with clever components. The bidding mechanism is interestingly designed, as is the pass-the-master setup. And of course designing the castles is just wonderful. Great game.

I have played this game a number of times now with different groups and have enjoyed every game.  Specifically, that despite the order of finish, you are able to look down on your castle and find pride or humor with how it is constructed.  For me, that is the game and where one is on the point scale is somehow a secondary aspect of the game.

Enjoyed this game of pricing tiles and arranging them for VPs. It is hard to keep track of all necessary information, e.g. how everyone evaluates each tile. You will make mistakes and basically gift a valueable tile to your oppenent. Still love the market mechanism, as you want to set the price for a tile so that your oppenents grudingly pay it. In addition there is some spatial thinking involved.

I wanted to give this a higher score since it's such a well constructed game. But I don't like tile placing games that much. Too much tactical evaluations of the other players castles. I understand the clever master builder aspect, but I would have preferred rooms sliding on a cost scale like in Suburbia. This would make it more strategic and less evaluational.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Pros: I like the theme, seeing the castles get built, and the management of one's personal budget until you get to be master builder again (i.e. get a source of income). The game also scales very well (rare for a game to play well at 2 players and more than 2), though I haven't tried solo yet.

Cons: The convoluted scoring method of this game is too much overhead, and makes me think that the game replaces depth of strategy with obfuscation. Plus it's awkward to try and read all the bonus icons from another player's castle. The point salad nature also encourages analysis-paralysis. I'm also not a fan of the room-stack finishing bonus, which is mostly random.

RATING: 8.5
Suburbia's little brother? Perhaps. Yet, this is the better of the two tile laying games. In fact, for me, it surpasses Suburbia in just about every way. I appreciate a medieval theme more than a city-building theme. The play time is shorter by about 30 minutes. My wife and I can play a game of Castles in about an hour compared to 90 minutes with Suburbia. The master builder is an awesome mechanic that has no match in Suburbia. Also, and perhaps most importantly, the scoring is much less convoluted in Castles. I will say, that despite the arguments on both sides, the tiles are thin in Castles, thin enough to damage one when punching them out (despite being careful). So, it loses a half point in that regard. Nevertheless, the thin tiles do not negatively affect gameplay. Plus, the art on the tiles is very nice. I love this game, and can't wait to play it with more than 2!

RATING: 9
A game I didn't mind losing in for at least 10 or so plays. Heck, I still don't really mind sometimes if my castle is pretty enough.

You build a castle with different rooms that all give different bonuses after connecting all entrances to other rooms and you try to score points. The idea that you take 
turns being the one pricing and selling the rooms is great
and adds quite some depth.

A great gateway game into the hobby! My sister and her boyfriend played 9 games (!) in a row the first time I introduced it to them.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Rating raised on further plays. The core game is fine, and my issues with it seem to only affect the 2-player game, but I don't entirely like the bonus cards. It feels like the game can have a huge 'points salad' swing from hidden bonuses at the end - I've seen 29 pts come out of thin air from a player who played averagely and collected bonus cards.

Comments added after playing 3-4 players.

(based on 2-player)
Much-hyped bestseller left me a little cold due to the randomness of the game's scoring potential. It feels like the design fights itself, setting up room combos and scoring objectives which rely on rooms which may never enter play. The other thing is the secret bonus cards may agree or conflict with the open bonuses and the make-up of the room cards, giving players an unfair boost or disadvantage.

Could have been a great game, I'm not sure why it's been designed to subtract from the inherent depth at the game's core. Still a good game to play over a cup of tea - it feels good to build something and growing your castle is an enjoyable process. I think the component quality is perfectly fine, too.

Edit: After playing a 4-player game, I much, MUCH prefer this number of players, in fact it feels like this was designed for 4 and scaled down badly to 2.
Further Edit: 3-players is the sweet spot for me, though I still don't like the bonus cards.

I found the game to be overly complex and rules heavy for what it was - castle building.  Quite a bit of meat, with room combos and scoring.  Primary interaction mechanism was via the master builder ranking the different room tiles in order.  

I have the same issue with this as Princes of Florence - it relies on players being aware of the relative value of the rooms and paying close attention to other players to see what is going on so that they don't inadvertently give one player a massive advantage (which not only detriments the builder but also the other passive players).  The importance of this role encourages AP big time.  Certainly not a game to be played casually and hence one that I wouldn’t be keen to play again.  For that reason I can't give it more than a 6.

[b]2015-11-15 8[/b]* After 7x 2-4p:
Feels like a game of Suburbia+, this game's Master Builder really adds another layer to the building game. The castle building is fun, and at 3p/4p, it becomes really challenging to evaluate each tile's benefit. The play is mostly streamlined and intuitive, with the exception of depletion bonus at game end. Interesting irregular tile laying and it could be even better with less obvious calculations in 2p games.

The beautifully made app changed my perspective on this one a bit as I didn't quite understand some of the potential strategies. End game bonuses can make up about half of your score at times (between the orange bonus cards, the shared goals, and the room/hallway/stairs stack depletion bonuses). Price setting is also more intriguing than I thought initially due to players' varied incentives.

Hmm, not bad, but not much new either. All known mechanisms. This is a slow moving game, the price setting, the buying process, the puzzling aspects of it leading to AP for some people.In this genre I prefer Suburbia or City Tycoon, which play much quicker and smoother.

Building a castle with the wonderful tiles in this game is really fun, but what makes it awesome is the Master Builder mechanic where you try to price rooms high enough that your friends don't take what you want, but low enough that you can still afford it. Wonderfully built game. One of my Favorite light games.  
There can be a lot of downtime when the master builder sets the prices.  Scoring at the end takes some time and is not easy.

I want to like this game more than I do. It's not a bad game, not at all, it's just a bit chaotic for me. I like the idea of it more than the actual gameplay, though I will occasionally play it. The whole re-arranging the rooms, determining which to allow to go for little and which to demand more money for, it's something I'm just not as keen of.

I much prefer Suburbia to this, where there's a clear system to it all. I do like that the rooms are different shapes and sizes, and how the rooms score and give you benefits. In fact, I would really love to try the middle ground between this and Suburbia.

RATING: 9.5
Edit: after more than 20 games in a year now, I can certainly say that this game is my hit for 2014. The extension is not so interesting, but the base game is just WOW

------

Easy game, rules are explained in ~20 minutes.

The material is not beautiful, and could be somewhat more evident: it's sometimes hard for new players to understand where the room symbols are located. After a few game, you quickly get the feeling and everything is now clear. 

The game is incredible!  
The mechanism of having a player being the one who will set the price of the rooms for each round is brilliant and brings the needs for the players to check the castles of other players, even if they can't impact directly the castles (not destruction/interaction possibility). 

In addition of the mecanic, the theme is nice: I have seen a player making a batman cave, building only underground rooms. When I have time (in few downtime), I look at the layout of each castle, having fun in looking at the strange connections between rooms :)

There are few "combos" to make, but you can't break the game with a flow of combos chains, so it's more like you make a good round than going crazy in victory points. 

Have fun!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This game is satisfying on many levels.  There's immense enjoyment in simply building your wonky castle.  It can be quite deep, and yet one can play it fairly casually.  The theme comes through with the various room types and names.  Players might even be tempted to explain their castle's layout.

The Master Builder phase, where you set the prices of tiles, can be an AP trap.  However, despite being prone to AP myself, after a couple of plays I'm able to make a decent decision and then "walk away" from the line up.

It's a winner because the theme is fun, and the game is both breezy and deep at the same time.

A very good spatial-intelligence game, one of my favorite genres.The theme is wonderfully tied in the game, components are excellent and gameplay is quite interesting with many options and a balancing factor of player-determined costs. However, the adjacency tends to matter less than I’d like and there is often a lot of downtime, especially during Master Builder phase. I still think that Suburbia from the same designer is more to my taste due to higher adjacency importance, but this is a game I’d happily play as well.

Excellent "city" building game. Auction mechanic is very interesting and the random tiles that come out really make you adjust your strategy on the fly. The expansion is easy enough to teach and adds quite a bit that I always include it. Component quality is very good but be careful because many pieces are very small and easy to lose. The theme and art is minimal though so do not expect to be captivated every time a card or tile is flipped over.

Fantastic tile laying game. Very similar to Suburbia but with more player interaction.

Castles is a variant of suburbia. Both games have a different feel. Castles is more thematic, the game looks better overall.  Love setting the price on the tiles. It can slow the gsme down, but it adds something to the standard market of suburbia. In the end I prefer suburbia with two players, although castles is great with two as well. Castles is the better game with 3 or 4 players.

Smooth gameplay - less overhead than Suburbia - the game is not confrontational and seems like the perfect couple's game :-) the box contains too much empty space though and it's a little bit pricey for what you get. Being the master builder can cause some AP and you need to take care not to forget about the bonuses when laying a tile but it all works really well and at the end you really feel like you have accomplished something.

The game is full of great choices between pricing things as master builder and purchasing tiles to fit into your strategy. Two thumbs up from me.

I really wanted to like this game more than I do. I do enjoy it, but I find that I vastly prefer Suburbia. There's just something about Castles of Mad King Ludwig that I don't quite grok, and it makes playing it feel somewhere halfway between fun and a chore.

Traded. I may reacquire someday, but for now there are just too many other games I'd rather play.

Reacquired and played again. Liked it more on the most recent play. I think I might still prefer Suburbia, but Mad King is gaining ground.

Lighter than Suburbia.  In Suburbia each hex will interact with up to 6 tiles around it:  so there are lots of interactions.  Suburbia also has 3 different "resources" to manage: income, reputation and population.  These features make Suburbia an extremely deep and mathy game.  CML simplifies the resources to just money.  Also, the highly interactive hex-tiles of Suburbia are replaced by eccentric tetris-like shapes which usually interact with only 2 or 3 other tiles.  These changes make CML lighter with less to think about with each choice.  The master builder mechanism of CML is quite fun and the tetris like shapes feel more visually appealing.  Overall, I probably like CML better than Suburbia, but I think a lot of people will like the depth & complexity of Suburbia better.

First and foremost, not a bad game. I'll gladly play it again. Sadly for Mad King, there's one game out recently, which does nearly the same thing better.

So why do I think Isle Of Skye is superior to Mad King Ludwig?
1) The graphics of game components. Sorry.
2) The theme. I understand this is just my personal preference (my wife and I visited British isles just this autumn, while the castles just remind me of our dreadful high school history teacher :-/ ), but then again, this is my personal game evaluation.
3) IoS can take 5 players.
4) The Mad King tiles don't follow some trivial square grid to be seen. I get it, that's thematic for mad castles, but changing the tile angle or position by less than a millimetre will suddenly make some doors not fit, even though they're supposed to be fitting. That won't happen to you in Skye, with a plain Carcassone-like square network.
5) The four random shared goals are scored just once in Mad King, at the end. For as little as 2 points, this feels kinda anti-climactic.
6) Being a master builder is a HUGE advantage. A *huge* one. That's a normal thing in games, 1st player is somehow better or worse each round than all other players - but if that's the case THIS much, there should be a mechanism making sure that all players have been first the same number of times.

And to be fair, why is Mad King better than Isle of Skye?
1) It has a prettier box. That's where the "prettier" stops.
2) The different little effects triggered when closing a room are one extra nice thing to think about. Sadly they are scarcely a game-changer. But sometimes even little differences matter! :)
3) Examining the function of your built castle might bring some funny talks - "So, to bring the food from kitchen to dining room, the cooks have to go thru catacombs and meditation room. Great..."

TL,DR: Not a bad game. But unless you're a big middle-ages architecture fan, rather go check out Isle of Skye.

Similar in it's design to Suburbia, players will purchase tiles (Rooms) to add to their castle. Certain rooms will synergize better or worse with other rooms (ie. you don't want a music room next to a bedroom). A market row is populated with room tiles, and players take turns acting as a "master builder", where they can set the price of tiles on that row, remembering that when they do this, other players will pay them for the tile they choose, and the master builder themselves will pay the bank. Therefore, you want to ensure you price tiles appropriately to tantalize other players into buying them from you, but not the one you want to buy! Excellent lighter-midweight euro style game with lots of good, tough decision making.

A nice lightweight game with some interesting decisions to make due to the inbuilt bidding mechanic.. The fun part of the game is constructing weird shaped castles with room combinations that lack logical or rational sense.. This game does not contain enough depth or strategic planning to score much higher for my taste.. But a fun building game never the less.. Edit: after a couple of games it seems really easily, grated they have only been two players, with more might affect the difficulty.. I prefer tougher games, i don't think i should be able to score 160vp after just a second game.. This game would of got a much high rating if it was not for the cheapskate components, it saddens me that a publisher/game designer thinks it's acceptable to charge such a high price for the cheapest flimsy components i have seen in a deisinger game, Deisinger being the key word here.. Rant over!!

After one solo play I like how this game has streamlined some of the concerns I had with Suburbia. Scoring is far more straightforward and the backwars/forwards issues over score points has gone altogether.
Now looking forward to playing against opponents.
After a 3 player game, my rating has increased. The game plays so smoothly and quickly that it delivers a truly tremendous gaming experience. The artwork on the tiles is superb with each room being different which in turn adds some humour into the game as you see your castle grow.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

Great theme, solid mechanics, fun to play. My only grievance is the graphic design, which I hope was more lavish and detailed; this would add greatly to the immersion of the "being-thereness". 

Also, after the first few games the joy of building kind of goes away and it kind of becomes "just another euro", as players start to optimize and maximize, but maybe that's just the way of things. Still, rating down from 8+ because of this.

After a dozen plays I'm kind of at the point of needing the expansion (which I haven't tried) to continue playing this one.

I didn't think it would, but Castles has replaced Suburbia for me. I still enjoy Suburbia more for the individual tile powers, but I really enjoy the Master Builder mechanism here. It kind of feels like an inverted auction. This one definitely plays better with more though. Suburbia I'd still probably prefer with 2, but Castles is much better with 3 or 4. Really the only issue I have with this game is the setup and storage, which are way more complicated than they should be. For the price of this game, they should have included a decent insert. I also think the hidden scoring cards can be a little overpowered if someone goes heavily into them, but otherwise this is an excellent game, and my favorite tile-laying game to date.

Replaces Suburbia, and is more enjoyable than Isle of Skye.

Building a castle has its rewarding moments but it quickly turns repetitive and the interaction is low. There are many mechanisms that feel out of place, such as objects being hidden and further preventing players from interacting. I couldn't help thinking whether building one castle together had been more fun.

Good strategic fun. Pricing the rooms as Master Builder can be especially tricky! Every game is unique because of variable setup and will stretch players in a different direction each time.

I enjoyed Castles as a game, but found myself wanting to play Suburbia more.  I like the more random elements and price setting in the game, but my biggest complaint is the game felt too short at 22 cards for 2 players.  In Suburbia I felt like I have built a city, in Castles I feel like I built half of a castle.  A longer game for 2 would bump this score up.

RATING: 7
In this game, themed after Mad King Ludwig, players take turns being a Master Builder to set prices for different rooms. Players purchase rooms, with the cost going to the Master Builder and construct the room into their castle. Closing a room by enclosing all entranceways of the room gives the player a bonus, such as more VPs or another turn. 

At the beginning of the game, 4 out of 24 favour tiles are drawn randomly to determine what will also score points for majority purposes (most of a particular tyoe will score 8 VPs).

It's a fun game, and I want to get in more plays. I understand the flow better after my first game, and there are many ways to earn points. The icons and colors can be a bit tough to understand at first, but it should become second nature. There were a few subtlties that I missed in my first game, and would like to play again to improve. Rating may rise with more plays.

I do not generally enjoy tile builders, but this game has made me re-think this.

I enjoy being crazy and building crazy castles and this game kind of makes me feel partially insane. There are random objectives at the beginning of each game that help this feeling.  You might have the goal of creating a castle with the most outside doors for example. It really aids you in feeling like you are building a castle for a crazy guy.

Dry tile laying game that has an excellent in game pricing system. The master building orders the value of rooms available to build (increasing by set prices) and players must pay the master builder. 

PROS
-Price /value system is great, would like to see this in other games. 

CONS
-Basic match the colours etc tile placing game.
-Minimal to no interaction. 
-Game in general, especially the room names, are too abstract. 
-Luck comes from whether people have money; if you are the master builder and everyone is broke, your income is next to nothing no matter you do.
-Lots of components to sort and stack each game.  
-Keeping score is a painful chore.

RATING: 3
Firstly, I hate the box for this. There's no bags it comes with, there's a lot of empty air, the tiles are fiddly, and the cards are SO tiny. Actual gameplay is fiddly with matching up your castle, trying not to bump anything off, and leaving teeny, tiny coins on the rooms to build up annoys me since you have to move them for almost all the master builder's turns. Overall, the components disappointed me.

Gameplay itself is decent, but not very captivating for me personally. I felt there was a lot of downtime when the MB was deciding how to orient it, and even then, sometimes it wouldn't matter, if a bunch of people were gonna get stairs or something anyway. Other times, when you're MB, your decision for what to price at what was random, at least for the start of the game. You could do the sorting by VP count or completion bonus, but overall, its hard to know what your opponent is aiming for in the beginning. Sometimes, you could also really need a certain room type, and in lower player games (2 or 3 player), only 1-3 of the room types come out at all.

Overall, this was a very disappointing game given how much it was heralded in 2014. I suppose the one good thing was that I learned a bit more about my tastes and what games I like and don't like.

One play in and it is a lot better with more game than expected. Lots of tile interaction and interesting decisions to make. 

Many more plays and the auctions really make the game. All players need to be aware of the economy of the game in order to prevent advantages to other players. The scores look like they are increasing over time. 

Rules are still a little wonky with how to score a room and when.

O Rei Ludovico II da Baviera ficou conhecido por seus castelos - o mais extravagante deles inspirou inclusive o castelo da Disney. É a inspiração do Castles of Mad King Ludwig, jogo de tile placement em que cada jogador é um arquiteto de castelos a serviço do rei, tentando atender às exigências do monarca. Ele quer castelos com mais quartos? Brigue com outros construtores pelas plantas disponíveis. A cada rodada, um define os preços, e paga quem quiser. Os castelos eventualmente fazem pouco sentido - o que explica o nome do jogo. Recomendado para novatos.

Lowered back down to a 9 after realizing how easy (and unstoppable) it is to win when going after a new player.

The scoring is not quite as fiddly as it seems based on the rulebook but it still takes a bit more time than what I would be comfortable with. The scoring scheme also directly causes slowing down of other parts of a round: The master builder reordering the tile market, and the players deciding which tile to buy. When all of these downtime-generating phases are combined, the resulting game moves way too slowly for the tile placement puzzle to be worth the time invested.

I like the theme and the differentiating factors compared with other modern Eurogames, but in the end the theme takes too much investment from the players to really work. 

I can get behind a game without a perfect theme, but the other side of it is that I didn't find evaluating the tiles as Master Builder to be all that interesting. While there is a lot to think about, you're either thinking too long or pricing things wrong. It was just not super satisfying to me, nothing really objectively wrong with it.

1) Na starce pobierz 4(6) karty celów, ale na koniec policz tylko 2(3) najwyższe.
2) Możliwość dociągania kart komnat jak w carson city (żeby uprościć dobieranie/zmniejszyć mózgożerność)
3) Graj 44 kartami, gracze na zmianę ciągną 2x więcej i odrzucają połowę

Wow.  Very different, but very fun with both 2 and 4 players.  I need to try it with 3 and see if we get the best of both versions.  It is much easier than it first appears from the instructions and goes quickly when everyone knows the game.  The player aid is more clear than the instructions in some instances.  I need to play this with more and evaluate AP, but I love the variety and little puzzle so far.  My family digs tactile games like this.

Get this thing away from me! After being such a big fan of Suburbia, Paulo and I were so excited to play the latest from Ted Alspach. And my oh my, did this game disappoint. First off, the box is 50% bigger than what it needs to be. Gorgeous artwork though it is, the components scarcely take up half of the inside. So poor design there. Secondly, it feels like half a game; one strong central mechanic (the master builder controlling the market) surrounded by a lot of meaningless and artless cardboard. Thirdly, most importantly, the game is simply not fun or intriguing in any way. I understand the appeal of Suburbia in the Middle Ages with just ONE CASTLE but the strategy is half of what it was in Suburbia; there's no give/take with points, the bonuses are incremental, and the cardboard bits are so underwhelming. For shame Alspach! I'll be around for your next game though.

It's a tricky game to play well the first time, which is always a positive in a Euro, because it's hard to wrap your head around all the factors that go into the correct valuation of a room - the doors, the VPs, the bonus points, the closing bonus, its contribution to favor bonuses, and its usefulness/buildability to each player. Which means there's stuff to explore, but it also means that the first game doesn't allow the game to shine so well. There's little cheer/groan factor, instead the overriding emotions as the master builder who sets the valuations are one of damn, I undervalued / overvalued the buildings, or as one of the pickers one of quiet satisfaction at getting something you want cheaply, or having to make a decision on just how much you're willing to pay for the building you'd prefer. The other downside is that the game feels a bit repetitive - value buildings, take buildings, take buildings, take buildings, value buildings, take, take, take, etc. I like how the bonus cards lead players into different valuations and along different paths though. I'd play again to see if it ratchets up in enjoyment with more experience.

I have played this game six times now and find it to be a consistent pleaser to most who play it. Every game seems to play out a bit differently, and I always amazed at how I can miss opportunities to do better.   As long as players play quickly and don't let AP get hold of them, this game has a great pace and seems destined to see the table again and again.

You can sense the similarities with suburbia, but still it's quite different. I love the very different sized pieces that you are supposed to build a puzzle with. 

Maybe they have stuck to much to thematic correctness where most rooms of a certain kind scores the same extra or penalties when adjacent to other rooms. a variation there would have made the game more strategic. 

We always have a difficulty to remember to do the extra action when finishing corridors and hallways.

I have played this game several times so far. I really like it. The castles are very interesting and I don't think I could ever build one exactly like one I previously have built.

2 Plays - Quality game, just not for me. Enjoyed trying to combo my own tiles together/ set them out so that I could fit in what I wanted. I didn't enjoy having to set out the tiles for auction. It just felt tedious having to break your concentration from your own castle, to then try to make sure you don't make anything other people want to cheap/ expensive. Nice mechanic, just not for me.

RATING: 7
Based on one play: You set prices for different pieces of a castle and then place them so that the rooms connect one tot he other without overlapping. Surprising works quite well with the pieces having enough variability but not to the point where you are always trying to guess if the pieces are lining up. Each type of room will also give you a bonus when you close it off including end game points. A nice mechanic that is simple enough to teach but has some nice strategy embedded.

I just do not get the hype with this one.  All the different shapes you can build with are supposed to be wacky fun.  I find the shapes in this game, for some reason, to be annoying.  I really dislike how infinitesimally small the icons on many of the tiles are.  This makes being the Master Builder more annoying than it should.  It is very difficult to strategically or tactically set prices as the Master Builder.  For one, values are very dependent on secret goal cards which are obviously hidden.  But much of the information that is supposed to be public is nearly impossible to see.  I am somewhat certain that if I just randomly arranged the tiles as Master Builder, my score would not really be worse.  The tiny money and tiny tiles and tiny icons all made this game a fiddly and annoying experience.  I would MUCH MUCH rather player Isle of Skye.

And one more complaint:  I HATE ZIGZAGGING SCORE TRACKS!

Castles of Mad King Ludwig feels a lot like Alspach's earlier game, Suburbia--each turn, you buy a tile to add to your castle, trying to get it to align to both public and personal goals.  In this game, however, you're not trying to build up your income; instead, the game features a (mostly) closed economy--the "master builder" player sets the prices for all of the tiles, and players pay that player for the piece that they choose.  The castle tiles come in a variety of shapes and sizes, makes the game visually interesting as well as provides tile placement challenges.  These rooms all have a type, which determine what kind of bonus a player earns when the room is "completed" (all of the doors lead somewhere).  Some of these bonuses include another personal goal card, taking an extra turn, money, or points.  I really enjoyed this game--it was fun trying to figure out what tiles were worth to other players, and trying to build up my own castle.  The puzzle of putting my castle together to fulfill goals, complete rooms that were important to complete, and maintain flexibility for future turns was really engaging to me.

Definitely not the "Suburbia killer" I've heard. It's got a similar feel, yet completely different gameplay. I prefer this to the higher player counts on Suburbia, but only marginally.

I'm also quite impressed that the pieces fit all together proportionally. I've seen some interesting looking castles. I do think the bonus cards can be a bit too random in terms of points, but I think that a more skilled player will often win.

Try Jan/17 - I'd heard about this one, and was keen to try.  It didn't disappoint.
Seems easy to teach, and includes a nice summary reminder of the rewards.  Colourful pieces that seem easy to distinguish from each other.  Different objectives available (publicly and secretly) to give players a variety of goals to work towards.  Very enjoyable, and looking forward to playing again.  Even with the full 4 players, we finished in less than 90 mins if I exclude the teaching time; was just over 90 with it.

I kept thinking this was similar to Suburbia and pleasantly surprised that it's a decent and different enough game to enjoy both.  I liked the different configurations for the castles.  The instant bonuses for closing off rooms were good.  Money was tight, however manageable with the Master Builder, completing an outdoor room, or grab an income.  I thought the bonuses were highly improved by awarding points over "most" or "least" of anything.

One main issue was the Master Builder setting the room prices.  While it adds strategy and gaming your opponents (who select first), it causes AP when the builder looks over every opponent and see what they have/need.

It's either NOT a game that you have full control over your opponent.

As a big fan of Suburbia, I was really looking forward to this. It basically re-implements the earlier game with some exceptions. First, instead of the sliding market adding additional costs to tiles, each turn one player takes on the role of master builder. She arranges the market, setting a price for each room. Players then buy rooms, paying the master builder. Finally, the master builder buys and pays her money to the bank. This adds an interesting interaction wherein the master builder has to try to value each tile for each player, do some quick cost-benefit analyses, and set the market. This can lead to some AP issues. It wasn’t really an issue in my game because we were still learning and mostly took the attitude “we don’t care, let’s see what happens.” This part is also the only interaction in the game. The tiles players buy no longer interact with other players at all. This is something I enjoy in Suburbia, and I missed it here. However, there are more ways to make combos that score points in one’s own castle. Typically, just building a certain type of room can score additional points, and completely finishing a room (i.e., connecting all its doorways) grants additional bonuses. One aspect I appreciate more here than in Suburbia is the spatial element of laying out rooms. Because of the varied shape and sizes, the decision on where to place a room is much more interesting in Castles. 

After just one play, I think I prefer Suburbia, but either way I’m pretty certain I don’t need both.

Goal Met :star::star::star::star::star: $1 or less per play

This game is a great game which kind of reminds me of Castle of Burgundy (without the diminishing effect of completing a region). I thoroughly enjoyed my first play, especially later in the game when things become second nature (adding room gets point and adjacency rules on scoring points) then the game really speeds up to a nice conclusion. The setting the value of each room is key to victory in this game as I've let my fiancee gain points virtually for free. 

This game is a bit crunchier than I thought from looking at videos and reading reviews. There are multiple things you need to consider and it really is a bit brain burning so it's definitely a medium weighted game.

The theme is stronger than a lot of Euros out there so it's a plus in my fiancee's book.

Best tile game ever! You actually feel like you're building a floor plan of a castle. Plays great with two and I bet it would play well with more. The components are great quality. It's aesthetically pleasing and quite strategic but not too dense or long. In fact, when playing with two we add more tiles than called for because the game just seems to go too fast!

Cool little game. Issue for me is that it ruled out Suburbia for playing with my wife, and I like some features of Suburbia better.

Same old kind of set collection mechanisms: keep connecting rooms of different types to achieve points in various ways, including with bonus cards for extra VP at end, e.g. 3VP per food room. 
Some luck dependence on draw of bonus cards and rooms in each round. 
The current player sets the price of the available rooms, which leads to some analysis paralysis whilst checking which room is best for which player.
Summing up: graphically ugly, no real theme, complicated but not complex, and drags on a bit in a repetitive way. Don't understand how this got nominated for artwork and innovation.

As someone who loves Suburbia, I had high expectations for this one and they were more or less met. I like puzzling out the best layout for optimal scoring, but in the end, building a castle is just fun. The price setting "master builder" mechanism is intriguing and can be quite agonizing. This is because you want to set the room prices in a way that is both advantageous for yourself and just advantageous enough for everyone else so you get paid some money. Unfortunately, it's my least favorite part of the game for the sole fact that it can (and will) increase downtime/trigger AP. It's easy for a new or inexperienced player to set prices that can possibly inadvertently king-make, which is not ideal. With that said, CoMKL is still an enjoyable game from time to time.

P: 1-4, T: 90 min, SdJ-NTile placement. Castle building theme.Compare to Suburbia (same designer): a little lighter (no balancing of population/reputation/income engine needed), less interaction, less demanding mathy analysis, less thematic scoring ('Mad' is apt), more tactical (less long term planning), more focused (less open-ended).-Master Builder price setting subject to AP. While I appreciate the "cake slicing" mechanic, it seemed to really bog down the game (both in thinking time and turn/flow interruption), long set up time (initial)- also set-up rules make 2 play games much more random based on what gets excluded from the game.Own Android App

After playing a number of 2 player games: it feels a little lacking in the 2 player format. Possibly not seeing quite a few tile types can really hamper your goals and the market/building queue can stagnate quite a bit

RATING: 9
In this game you draw an assortment of tiles, the active player decides the prices, then each player gets to buy before he does, paying him for the tiles. You add the tiles to the castle and score points for the tile and the effects of neighboring tiles should they matter. Then there are secret goals and public goals to get more points. It's like an alternate universe suburbia, which is more thematic, because the tiles are silly and in interesting shapes, and more interactive because you need to pay attention to what other players want and what they can afford to pay.

Surprisingly good.  The component quality does leave something to be desired (the main "board" sections tend to warp, and the room pieces are crazy thin...by necessity to allow them to stack...but, I've been spoiled by the typical higher quality cardboard of Z-man or FF), but the game is great fun.  Very fast playing, a little mathy without being obnoxious, and fairly easy to explain to newcomers.  BUT, the scoring can be a little obtuse and luck does play a somewhat significant factor in who wins.
I'd recommend it at a discount (say, down to $40 or so), but the MSRP is kind of nosebleedy for what you get.  Expansions would be appreciated regardless.

8 - Though I don't like to rate games after a single play I feel like I got a good taste of this game.  I loved the layouts and spatial orientation of things you need to build and buy.  Another play would impart the significance chaining and cascading rooms, something I found during the last round of the demo game we played.

*****
8.5 - Turns out I'm pretty terrible at this game but oddly enough I don't care.  It's fun building the castle and growing a narrative with each room you add. Though I try to build based on cascading points I often get blocked by a lack of funds or somebody buying the room I want before my turn comes up and it doesn't matter because the game is still fun.

Elsőre nagyon káosz volt a fejemben, mert szabályt csak leírásokból ismertem. Másodikra tisztult ki teljesen, így viszont egy igen jó kis játék bontakozott ki a szemünk előtt.

Jó a hangulata is, és tényleg szép kastélyokat lehet építgetni belőle. Jó vétel volt!!!!!

RATING: N/A
A promising-looking "I cut, you choose" market mechanism where you set prices for others to extort money from them, and it disappears into this horrible miasma of set collection and awkward, arbitrary bonus assignment. 

In order to set prices effectively, one would have to know supply and demand. That's…kind of what effective market pricing is. And in this game, you remove room replenishment cards from the game before it begins, the result being that some room tiles might not be represented equally. That would be useful to know from a "supply" standpoint, no? What the supply actually is? (Spoiler: yes, yes it would be useful). And what do you do if you're dealt a bonus tile that rewards you for buying tiles that are going to be disproportionately held out of this particular game? And because of this uncertainty around Supply, you are unable to prioritize your own bonuses, not if it will take all game for you to discover that your pink room bonus won't amount to anything because too many pink room cards were shuffled out of the game back in the setup phase. 

Now on to "Demand." The first couple times around the table, you simply do not have enough information to know what other people's plans are, and so pricing is a little awkward. It is entirely possible that you price something low that is perfect for someone else. It is possible that the next player does this as well. And the main point here is that there are going to be some early turns where you're fishing for information rather than setting the correct balance between "Extortion" and "Temptation." Given a 15 turn game (roughly), you kind of have to waste three or so at the start because you simply don't know what people are targeting. And the bonuses can be pretty much anything, including "get one of each room type" (good luck spotting the player pursuing that one by round 5 or 6). From a risk perspective, you pretty much always have to assume that your private bonuses are underrepresented, and that turns the game into nothing more than maximizing tactical opportunity. In other words, the strategic stuff in the game is a distraction more than anything. 

I'm getting weary of Eurogames that are little more than gussied up Set Collection, and that's precisely what this one is. That it's in the Top 50 is crazy to me. This game's failure might be on me, though: I saw the market mechanism and thought "extortion and market manipulation in a multiplayer game!" and that is just [i]not[/i] what this game is at all. Yeah, yeah, I'm sure there are those who would say "not if you play with my group!" when I say it's not manipulative or aggressive enough, but holy crap, there are dozens of games that [i]are[/i] aggressive and manipulative that play faster, play better, and play cleaner than this. If my group is ever in the mood for market manipulation and extortion in 60-90 minutes, there's no way we'd ever choose this. This is a Eurogamer's definition of market manipulation; it is [i]not[/i] an economic gamer's definition of market manipulation. Player beware. 

The language of the game makes it look like an economic game, but it really isn't. It relies too much on the deliberate and uncommunicated withholding of information (both in the personal bonuses and in the removed replenishment cards). Not every game needs to be perfect information, but my goodness, exactly how does a player really take advantage of the chief innovation of this game if the information needed to do so is doled out in incomplete, deliberately unstable portions? In short, this is a mechanism in search of a game. And frankly, that game might be Coloretto.

Holy moly, do I dig this game.  Holding off on rating it just yet, but definitely looking like high nines.  This game feels quite a bit like Suburbia, but I like this better.  And I like me some Suburbia.

Update - Obviously, rated now.  This is my 3rd favorite board game overall.  So if you're reading this, then interpret that how you will.  Great game.  Interpret it like that.

RATING: 6
Pros:
1. Different. This is a tile laying game where the tiles aren't just squares with water, mountains, grass, villages etc. It's different rooms of a castle, with each room being graphically interesting.
2. Pricing system. I enjoy that the tiles are randomly drawn, but a player gets to rank and price them. This leads to a fun meta game.
3. Bonuses. It's not a game of just building high point value rooms. Considering connections bonuses and room completion keeps the game interesting.
4. App. This game has an app that is wonderfully done.

Cons:
1. Set up. This game is a pain to set up with each tile shape having to be separated out and stacked. I find it frustrating for a game that is a fairly quick play.
2. Luck of the draw. There's many tile laying games that suffer from this and this game doesn't do anything to address it. There are certain tiles that are very powerful and provide end game scoring. If those tiles always come out with bad timing, then you will likely lose. 
3. Table Footprint. The foot print for this game is extremely large. You will be building out your castle and it will likely not be tight and small. In fact, you're better off keeping it as spread out as possible to leave you many options. This means you need a very large table to play this game.

Summary: This is a very fun tile laying game. I would have zero problem ever playing this game given we have a play area large enough to handle it. However, the app version of this game is so well done and so much fun, that I don't have a reason to really ever buy the real version of this game. My recommendation would be to just spend the $6 for the app and let your friends buy the physical copy.

Really enjoy all aspects of this game. Love the tile laying aspect and building towards the final product. The combos that are possible from completing rooms and taking multiple turns at once is a great thing to work towards. One of my favourite aspects of the game is when you get to choose the order of the tiles for the auction. Lots of info to take into account but wanting to make money vs. setting other players up for minimal success.

We even went so far as to trade away our original copy and then went out and bought the Polish version with the superior art.

RATING: 4
Cute, but shallow.
Takes quite a bit of set up and explanation for something so simple.  There's a lot of randomness present here, and it's entirely likely for the game to be skewed from the start thanks to inconvenient card draw and lopsidedly powerful secret goals.

In the end, spatially weaving rooms together is just enough fun to be disappointing when the game ends just before the castle you were building was starts to get interesting.

This is our favorite game, and another dinnertime game for us. This was also the first game that after the first play through my wife asked, "Can we play it again?"

I imagine due to the number of times we've played it, we much prefer the 2 player game to the 3 or 4 player game, but we'll never turn down a chance to play it.

A game that does ask you to keep track of the game situation more skillfully than your opponents in order to win. You'll need to manage your money.  You'll need to keep an eye on what is available and what resources will work well for you.  You have to be aware what you opponent would like to have and make them consider how dearly they wish to pay for it. And you have to be aware of what goals your opponents are trying to excel at.  

I did not necessarily do any of the above well at all when I played. I still had fun learning it.

Great castle building game!  Shares some mechanics with Suburbia by the same designer, but there are enough differences (beyond even the wildly different themes) to make owning both games worthwhile.

RATING: 6
Quite decent, but at the same time the game that made me realize how good (or better) "Suburbia" is. 

So what's my problem? It's too random for what it tries to achieve. It's not a short game and I feel like it promises more control, but fails to deliver. For starters: bonus card. Absolutely no control - and the nature of the card (points for every room) doesn't help. In "Suburbia", where you had to have "more" of something, it was enough to have 1 tile (if more didn't appear). Here, if the tiles don't appear, bad luck. This is especially painful in 2p games.

The master builder mechanic (pricing the tiles) is great, the game feels thematic, but all in all this is a family-oriented title, mostly because of the randomness. Trying to play it competitively is frustrating, so be warned! But as a light, fun game to relax it's fine and I can recommend it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The "fun" thing in this game is the theme of putting together your castle and sometimes the game doesn't encourage this, somehow I don't mind this at all and the game is still satisfying.  

A bit "RNGy" for bonus cards or rooms that come up, game also is best at 4.  Where some games get to be hyper strategic at the 2 player count, this one just flops.

Pictures don't do this game justice. Such a smooth and beautiful game. Has a much more natural flow than Suburbia, and the Castle pieces fit together surprisingly well. The new Master Builder market mechanic is perfect, and I'll be looking for a way to implement it into Suburbia. Scoring seems much more straight-forward here, without sacrificing options. Ludwig was a hut of an impulse buy for me, but did not disappoint. Probably one of my favorite releases this year.

Great game. It's fun to build castles! It's nice when games provide other sources of satisfaction other than winning, and it's certainly satisfying to create your own bizarre floor plan. Your creation looks totally different every time.

I don't find that, as others have commented, the game bogs down with too much thinking. However, I've only played it with two so far.

RATING: 8.85
Fun game.  Great theme.  Nice to see the 'mad' castles that are built in this game.

I prefer this to Suburbia....mainly due to the more concrete theme.  Suburbia seems a little more abstract.

They say Suburbia is better 2P, but Castles works fine 2P for me.

The master-builder is an interesting mechanic that I hadn't seem before.  Faster and more unique than an auction.   I like the fact that when you're the master building you can put some tiles "out of reach."

Recommended tile laying game.

The first time I heard about this game I thought it would be a "must have".  Then I heard some criticisms that made me go to "must try first".

My wife and I were pleasantly surprised at how easy and fun this game is.  The rules aren't complicated.  The mechanics are straight forward.

It feels very much like Suburbia (for a good reason), but I think Suburbia is a better game.  This game is decent, but I would definitely recommend Suburbia instead.

RATING: 8.4
A tough game that uses elements from Suburbia and bends them sideways to help build castles and then adds a bunch of additional elements to contemplate.  Building the castle and watching your work grow is really the draw of this game but as you do this you need to create a synergy of rooms to create the best castle which can really be difficult to foresee.  Probably the hardest part of the game is distributing the castles in the market order. Really fun brain burner game that probably needs a few plays to get going that uniquely themed and fun.   One bad it that the directions weren't written well so it took some time to finally get going.

RATING: 7
When I first played this game, my first impression was very much that I really cant see what all the fuss is about. There are decisions and strategy here, but it didn't really "feel" like a "real" strategy game, the main appeal seems to be getting to build a castle in a funny shape and with an amusing-sounding set of rooms. I realise this is underselling it a bit - there are certainly decisions to be made, and the game is interesting, and indeed fun. And it's grown a lot on me in the past 6 months or so. I still only rate it 7, and I still don't really think it's a top 50 game - but it is very well designed and with interesting decisions, and above all fun. Just not quite "special" enough to merit more than 7 from me.

This is a very interesting game. I have played a few games where you build out the playing area (ie, Suburbia, Betrayal). But this is the first one that I've seen that has such a great natural aesthetic feel. The pieces are all completely different sizes and you'll never build the same castle twice.

It does help that the rules are relatively simple. If a piece can logically fit, then you can place it! Of course, rooms have the NIMBY (not in my back yard) positioning restrictions that you have in City builders, which complicates things. Also, you'll be aiming for a different type of castle from your opponent, as you'll both have different hidden goals to strive for.

I've only played this 2 player - it's another game I think would get better with 3 or 4 players. But from what I've seen, I think it's quite a fun and interesting game that I think I would like to play a lot more often!

É praticamente um aprimoramento do Suburbia: um jogo de tile-laying em que os tiles pontuam na hora e de acordo com outros tiles vizinhos. O tema de construção de castelos é mais criativo e tem no mínimo o mesmo apelo para mim, mas com tiles de vários formatos, que tornam o jogo mais lúdico. O upkeep, grande problema do Suburbia, foi muito reduzido aqui. Em uma semana, já joguei 4 vezes, o que é raro pra mim num jogo novo.

Building the castle is pleasing, and the market is interesting in theory.  However, setting the market prices correctly requires a lot of detailed reasoning about every other player's position, just to eke out a small advantage, so it distracts from the interesting strategy and pleasing mechanics.  Doing math about other player's board positions isn't interesting, but forgoing that math makes the game pretty random.  Too bad.

29-03-2015. Rated after 1 play. Castles of Mad King Ludwig (Castles) is the follow-up game to Suburbia. In Castles, you try to build a strange castle, and get the most VPs for it. 

Each player starts the game with a foyer, a tile with 3 exits. Turns start by the master builder, setting prices for tiles by arranging the tiles. In turn order, all players can buy a tile starting with the player to the left of the master builder. If you buy the a tile, you must fit it into your castle. The tiles you buy give you points and restrict where they can be built by giving bonuses for building adjacent to some types of tiles (ie. gardens go great besides gardens) and penalties (music rooms next to bed rooms are stupid). If you finish a room, ie. all exits on the tile are alligned with other exits, you get a special bonus action, ranging from extra turns, more resources etc.You aim to get special end-game bonussen based on open information and some hidden information.

I didn't dislike this game. I think it's good, but I feel that Suburbia is a little clearer. I do like the graphical look of Castles better than suburbia, but the game is slower in comparison due to the master builder mechanisms. The master builder mechanisms is interesting, but also makes mistakes from the builder potentially game changing.

RATING: 9
I was super excited about this game and it totally is just cool!  My only "complaint" is that I don't think it is as good two player as Suburbia is, but it is an excellent game and I think it will do really well in the three to four player setting.  The fact that you have the "Master builder" who sets prices is why you need the extra people. (JW)

Very similar to Suburbia - more AP-prone since players can really struggle deciding how to value tiles as Master Builder.  But turn order seems to matter less, and tiles are not as unique - you're more interest in type of tile rather than the specific tile name like in Suburbia.

RATING: 9
Castles of Mad King Ludwig is a great game where player purchase different kinds of rooms from certain players who set the market price. Then players strategically place rooms into their castle to try to get the most points, since some room combinations are better than others.  This game has a similar feel like suburbia but far less abstract things to keep track of.  It flows much more smoothly than suburbia.

Pros:  fun puzzle aspect, interesting market price mechanism. Fun tactile creative gameplay. Many options for scoring points.

Cons:Setting thearket kinds to stall the game a little. Another game not suggested for AP players(Analysis Paralysis).long playtime

--Feb2016-- It's an interesting set of constraints around a surprisingly random auction game.  One has a stream of interestingly valuable items (that is, the items are definitely not of the same value to each player) and yet the players have (rotating) responsibility to price those items.  So it's another take on the "I cut, you choose" thing: easy to get wrong; hard to get right.  It's far easier to throw the game to the left neighbour than make decisions that benefit oneself.
As a result, the game is plausibly better when all players are of the same familiarity and skill level with the game.  But even then, I'd worry that the room-arrival-randomness would become the dominant signal in the game.  So not likely something I'm demanding to play.

A great tile laying game, Castles introduces the right amount of theme to keep those who aren't necessarily a fan of this "building" games, interested. I especially love the mechanic of the Master Builder setting the prices for each round. There is a ton of tension and strategy in trying to predict what your opponent wants to buy, and setting just the right price for it.

There is a lot to like in this game, especially if you like tile placements and earning VPs from the way you do, and working out how lots of different combinations of tiles tesselate to do what you want.  However, I disliked the main mechanic in the game - the "Master Builder" reordering the tiles on the market - it either degenerates into huge AP as they look how valuable each tile is for all their opponents, or someone gets a gift as they don't realise it's worth a huge number of points for them and make it cheap.  It's a shame, because there is a lot of nice stuff in the rest of the game, but that ruins it for me.  I'll stick to Suburbia.

Mindenképpen nagy negatívum volt a doboz kibontását követően, hogy egy relatíve óriási (=feleslegesen magas) dobozba képesek voltak insert nélkül belepakolni a kinyomó kartonokat. Ezt tetézi, hogy a viszonylag borsos árú játékból ugyanakkor képesek voltak kispórolni a műanyag tasakokat. Érthetetlen. A lapkák is lehetnének egy leheletnyivel vastagabbak, de főleg az igaz, hogy a kinyomó keretet hagyhatnák el könnyedebben...
A játék grafikáját sokan szidják, de szerintem irtózatosan hangulatos, és ami ennél is fontosabb, letisztult, egyértelmű és átlátható. Mindemellett az összes lapka egyedi.
A solo mód majdhogynem kissé megerőszakolása a játéknak. Közel sem annyira élvezetes, mint gondoltam. Gyakorlásnak viszont jó.

A játék veleje a különböző szobák árszintjének belövése, ami akár eredményezhet AP-s helyzetet, én mégsem éreztem ennek reális veszélyét. A játék nehézsége és játékideje nagyon jól van belőve. Szívesen játszom vele, nagyon hangulatos, hogy itt aztán tényleg nincs két egyforma parti. Ráadásul a végeredmény gyanánt elkészített kastély mindig büszkeséggel tölti el az ember szívét.
Nem egy full gémer, szerencsementes társas ez. Pont ezért nagyon szerethető. Kiemelkedő még benne a tetszés szerinti kombózhatóság is + a szabályok is logikusak és egyszerűek, egyáltalán nincs túlbonyolítva.

Played this game a couple of times in 3 players. Enjoy it very much. The rules are extremely simply but the game has a lot of depth. Easy to pick up by any player and enjoy. The only problem may be the down time between turns when the master builder has to decide the value of each tile in the market place. This can take a while. Otherwise, this game is extremely fun. Great for family. I played a whole bunch more on the iPad. It's great as well. One of the few games that I know I won't sell for sure. I am surprised it took me that long to play it since I bought it. It's a keeper.

Who does not want to build his own castle? And if it's a crazy castle it's even better! Really nice game with bidding, tile placement and very beautiful room tiles. There are no borders: so your castle can develop in every imaginable way.

Ok little game, nothing more nothing less. Price tag is way too high considering the components are shite. Dont need to play again.


Components:

Cheap all across the board. This game should not be more than 20 bucks. Talk about overproduction.

I am loving this game! A strict improvement over Suburbia. Great decisions required when deciding the pricing of the tiles and greatly adds to the interactivity of the game. The different sizes rooms makes a bit of a puzzle element as well. This all combines for a great, light game.

10. Outstanding. I'll always enjoy playing this game.

Fun and interesting tile layer with a great theme. I love building the castles because each one is different and unique. Each one says something crazy about you!

My first castle features strange and scary underground dungeons-- and an awesome bottomless pit! My second was the queen's theatre/garden castle.

This game would be 1000% improved by a good insert or organizer and a competent graphic designer. I love the idea of the game, but fiddling and squinting at the actual pieces detracts a lot from it.

HMy husband's gift for me for my birthday!

I like that the cards are small, as the game is a table hog already, and everything needed cannbe conveyed on a card this size, and read by my aging eyes (The rulebook, with text over a castle brick background in places, was not a great choice, and harder to read on certain lines because of that.

The cards should be better quality, but size doesn't mean quality necessarily. Larger cards aren't needed, and I find the smaller are more flexible size wise, for fitting in various storage options I'm considering.

I have a plano that was recently on sale, but too much room in it.

This is really very fun--drove to two different stores to get it after Amazon couldn't get it to me in time. It's a hair more complex to teach than I typically like, but the replayability is there thanks to shifting bonuses and goals, and the end-game timer seems set a few minutes before people are actually "done," leaving players wanting more.

I do wish the components were a bit bigger and the art a bit nicer--it's serviceable, but doesn't stand up to the top-down art in other games or on D&D's Dungeon Tiles. Then again, as soon as the inevitable expansion comes out I'll be first in line. Recommended.

I like this a bit better than suburbia for a few reasons:
1. I like the spacial element of having rooms with different sizes.  It adds a extra puzzle piece to the mix.
2. I like the price setting mechanic much more than the sliding cycle.  It feels like you have some control rather than getting unlucky with what tiles come out.

I'll admit that the end game goals feel a bit more lucky than in suburbia (due to good/bad luck with orange cards), but I've only played a few times so I could just be a baddie :).

Visual Appeal: (3)
The game puts function above artistry. There are some nice details to the rooms that make them unique, but any beauty comes from the arrangement of the pieces during gameplay and not the pieces themselves.

Components: (3)
The cardboard is just thick enough to keep its shape. No storage insert, just bags which is fine with all the oddly shaped pieces. Cards have a nice flex and decent finish, but they are minis. Player aids are essential to remember bonus actions, and thankfully they are included!

Theme: (5)
From the rule book, "Players are contractors looking for the best deals on rooms while selling their services to other players." This is very evident through the adjustable auction track which can be used to price gouge your opponents for decent rooms. The story of the REAL King Ludwig II is in the rule book, so it's educational as well. The rooms are designed to make you twist and turn whimsically to make the most absurd combinations. Who wouldn't want a buttery attached to their bedroom? Or how about a bottomless pit at the bottom of a flight of stairs? What do you mean you put the Queen's bedroom behind the bowling alley? She'll lose sleep for sure with all that racket!

Learning: (4)
I find this game incredibly easy to teach. Check the goals, price the rooms, pay for rooms, build them and move on.

Gameplay: (4) 
 Figuring out how to plan rooms is tough, and the auction seems balanced enough with rooms accruing a discount over time. The one detractor is scoring. What a pain! You absolutely must score rooms immediately and correctly, because going back at the end to check the score is a chore. If you have to do it, make sure your remember the point handicap for the 2nd-4th players from the beginning of the game!

Overall Fun: (5)
I've never had a bad time playing this game with any number of players. It comes out very often because of how likeable and accessible it is, and it produces plenty of laughs and difficult choices.

Alspach was a name we've never heard of until one year ago, when, by chance or coincidence, we watched a GameNight episode focused on a game called Ultimate Werewolf. The game sounded like a lot of fun, but, not having a big gaming group, we just kept an eye on the designer waiting for something different. So we got Suburbia, and was love at first sight. Rich, dense, deep, with countless interactions among tiles and one component that often is missing in many games: the freedom to go wherever you want, to develop your city in the way you thought being more interesting / rewarding. Could Castles of Mad King Ludwig be any better? Or at least at the same level?

The rules (honestly, badly structured and badly worded as all the Bezer Games rulebook we read so far) are quite simple. Rooms that will be used to build the castle are divided into ten stacks, according to their size (from 100 to 600 sqm). Inside each stack, tiles are randomized and then some of these (the exact number depends on the number of players) are returned to the box. In addition to the room stacks, there are two smaller stacks containing hallways and stairs. At this point, two separate deck of cards are prepared. The first one represent the "bonus cards": basically "secret objectives" that each player (and only him!) can score to gain extra points at the end of the game. The second deck (built on 11 cards / player) works as randomizer for new tiles to enter play. At this point, every player gains 15K Marks and the public objectives ("King's Favors") are revealed. All players can attempt achieving these.

The game begins with five cards from the randomizer being revealed (6 cards in a 3p game, 7 in a 4p game); on the board, there are a certain amount of spaces showing off a price (in a 2p game, ranging from 4K to 15K Marks) and the starting player ("Master Builder") decides what tile goes with one space. Id est, after tiles are placed on the board, there will be exactly one costing 4K, exactly one costing 6K, but which tile costs which price is decided by the Master Builder, who is the last one playing the round: the first player entitled to purchase a tile is the player on the left of the Master Builder, who pays the Master Builder (and not the bank) the cost of the tile. Once all other players have played, it's the Master Builder's turn to buy a tile, and he pays to the bank. Leftover tiles receive a cash bonus. Then a new round begins, with cards being drawn to replenish the reserve of tiles available for purchase. The new Master Builder may arrange the new tiles and the old tiles, according to his needs. As soon as all the cards in the randomizer are drawn, the game ends and you move to the final scoring. Points are also awarded during the game: each time a new tile is places, and when a room is completed (all doors lead to new rooms) special bonuses to resolve (depending on the type of room completed) are triggered.

The game plays fast, and it's incredible. It plays wonderfully 2p, and I suspect it will play wonderfully also 3p and 4p (should give the 3p option a try soonish). The auction mechanism is no proper auction mechanism: the price is set at the beginning of each turn, and it's set considering what tiles you want the other players to purchase and not to purchase, while you attempt to pursue your secret objectives and the common ones. So no obnoxious interactions where the guy with the most money dominates the game, and no absence of competition when played only 2p.

As said, the game is fast, 20-30 minutes and a 2p game is done; it plays faster than Suburbia and so far we are preferring it over Suburbia. Suburbia had a single strategy working better than others (maximize your income in the beginning of the game since the integral money earned over the game will be greater; and maximize your reputation later in the game, otherwise you'll be losing too much power during the game by repeatedly crossing the red barriers along the scoreboard), and some tiles that could lead to disastrous consequences (Casino, for instance, or the similar to the Casino tile that worked on reputation never decreasing), while this game appears (I haven't done the math for it yet) to be opened to many and different paths to victory.

As a plusvalore, some tiles are filled with little nerdy curiosities, such as a Suburbia or an Ultimate Werewolf image hidden as Easter egg on this or that tile.

Fantastic game.

I agree with Dog and Thimble's assessment that it is great fun to play, but the final castle you lay out can be a bit unsatisfying. Recommend using more room cards than recommended to make games last a bit longer. Once you know what you're doing, play time is much less than the 90 min on the box.

RATING: 7
Very decent game of building a castle and scoring points along the way. Add a touch of open competitive scoring, some final game hidden scoring and you have what would typically be a points salad game... except it's a bit more interesting than that. Additionally there's a short decision process by the Master Builder each round where the six available buildings are put up for valuation for purchase. The money goes to the Master Builder's purse, so if she values too low or too high (without regard for what the opponents are looking for), then she'll miss out on potential income. Finally there's a spacial element as you add rooms to your castle and look for bonuses by closing off rooms and building the right type of adjacent rooms. I find the game to be just the right weight and it plays in about an hour. Rules are easy to explain and follow. The theme matches the mechanics enough to get my stamp of approval I found Castles of Mad King Ludwig to be a much better game than Suburbia. Only the fiddly retrospective scoring of some rooms prevents me from enjoying it just that bit more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This has some excellent mechanical design regarding how money works across different players. The Favors and secret goals are great, and I'm a sucker for games where I get to build things.

Scoring can be a little clunky, with the varying icons and the restrictions on entertainment rooms changing from piece to piece, but this is just a small fly in the ointment of an excellent game.

RATING: 7
I think I prefer the cross-table city interaction of Suburbia rather than the intra-castle rooms interaction on offer here, but this is a nice looking game and the *ahem* price fluctuations from the Master Builder is a good mechanism.

And you'll have built a castle by game's end.

That King Ludwig, he's a madman!

Components are good quality, and should last over many plays. I'm disappointed that an insert wan't created for it to keep things sorted and set-up time shorter. Broken Token offers a super insert, but for those on a budget we resort to whatever containers we can scrounge up.

Art is good... it works but is nothing that blows me away. Some of the pieces could have been made nicer instead of plain gray, but the game play helps to overlook these flaws. 

I love building the castles, no doubt about it. There is something oddly satisfying in following in the mad king's footsteps. Win or lose, I have never had a bad game of COMKL!

I grabbed a used version of this one at the local gaming meet up, and was not sorry. I love to bring this to the table every chance I get.

RATING: 8
For me, this game is much more like what I expected from Suburbia and I expect that it will replace Suburbia for me. The room tile graphics are much more vibrant and give you a clear image of the castle you've just built which is more satisfying to look at in the end. Plus, there is less emphasis on the economy and more on building something interesting. The goals and tile bonuses/penalties still dictate to an extent what you will purchase and where you will place it but they feel more like building guidelines than an exercise in min-maxing your game stats.

After playing Suburbia and loving it, this title was on my radar.  I was a little underwhelmed by the component quality from what I saw on here, but now that I have the game, it isn't something I mind at all.  The gameplay is fun!  I love that not all of the buildings are going to come out and that the order that they come out in is totally random.  It's something that scares some players away, but this is the type of thing in a game that really attracts me.  The master builder element is also very cool in how you set the prices and get paid by the other players, but build last.  Really fine stuff!

You'll get a more rewarding experience and the game won't feel like you've been cut-off right before you were ready to build your masterpiece.

This game just doesn't live up to its potential. You don't actually feel like you're building a castle. The game ends after you've only built a few rooms. I feel like I'm just trying not to put quiet rooms next to loud rooms then suddenly the game is over. Kind of boring. I'm also not a big fan of the builder mechanic. It is different, but it doesn't make the game more enjoyable. It takes longer to set up than it does to play. Not very satisfying. It's mildly entertaining, but Suburbia, also by this designer, will give you a similar feel in a more enjoyable, more thematic game. Skip Castles of Mad King Ludwig. He would want a better castle than you can build with this game anyway.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Different than Suburbia for sure, but better? Certainly the way the goals work is a lot better, but the downtime while each player tries to figure out where to place the buildings is a negative for a light weight game.  Maybe that would get faster if you play the game enough, but the value of the buildings depends mostly on the current state of each player's castle, so if anything I think play time might increase as players gain experience.

This is one of our family favorites. There is just something incredibly enjoyable about building your own castle. It is both interesting and fun. The only fault is that it has a lot of tiles. A custom insert is highly recommended as it greatly reduces the setup time. Scoring can also be tricky if you make a mistake along the way.

RATING: 7
Played once with 3P. The comparisons between Castles of Mad King Ludwig and [thing=123260][/thing] are inevitable but for the most part, Castles offers a few slight, but welcome, improvements over Suburbia. For one, the art is cheerier and more vivid, enabling tiles to be made out from afar. The scoring process is smoother too, mostly because the scoring does not depend on your opponent's build, so there is no need to constantly check if you score anything when your opponent is adding a tile to her castle. 

The biggest difference would be the inclusion of the Master Builder phase, which is a great way to redirect the player interaction found in Suburbia and to mitigate the luck involved in the order of which tiles appear. I do recognise though that this phase can induce downtime since it's possible to calculate how much each tile is worth to each player, although the secret goals screw this up a little. Also, seating order would be a major factor in players' performances if there is a gap in players' skills. But I'm partial towards the cake-cutting mechanism in general, and I think it's a worthy mechanism to make up for the loss of Suburbia's scoring track speed bumps.

The downside is that both secret and public goals have been maintained, and I still find the combination a little too swingy for my tastes especially if you have goals which sync with each other. The components are also of questionable quality since the board in the copy I played was peeling after a few games.

Still, Castles of Mad King Ludwig has enough tweaks for the better to make it the superior game among the two, or at least in my opinion. It still is a fairly enjoyable experience even if considered on its own, as there aren't too many games with the cake-cutting mechanism out there.

I have only played this game a couple of times and liked it more the second go around than the first. So perhaps it will continue to grow on me. It felt very unique to me initially as I had never played Suburbia. I have since played Suburbia and think I may prefer it more than Ludwig. Mainly because it doesn't have the element I most dislike about Ludwig- players setting the prices of castle pieces each turn. But building rooms in the castle to where everyone has a unique layout by the end of the game is just plain cool. It looks really neat too. I haven't come close to winning this one yet. I think I've let my play be influenced too much by the starting bonus cards. Solid game and fun experience. I just need to figure out how to win. =P

Liking this one more each time I play it. I think my complaint about it, especially vs my other eurogames, is that the strategy is much less obvious the first couple of times you play it. Sure, it makes sense that you want to go after your bonus cards and get good completion bonuses wherever possible, but how to weigh those choices with the spacial strategy as well as the master builder mechanic is a little tricky. I actually find that the master builder piece is pretty swingy--someone *cough my girlfriend* can have a huge advantage when they're sitting to the left of someone new *cough her sister*.

Kastélyépítés egy kis San Marcós előkészítéssel. A soron levő játékos a véletlenszerűen kijelölt különböző formájú szobát beárazza ellenfelei számára, akik miután ezekből egyet vásároltak ő maga is egyet megvehet és bővítheti az épülő kastélyát. Az ellenfelek mindig az építőnek fizetnek, ami miatt jól meggondolandóan kell eltervezi az árakat, hogy keressünk is vele, de a magunknak szánt épületet azért lehetőség szerint ne vigyék el. Megvan az AP veszély rendesen, de érdekes módon nem éreztem vészesnek az első játék alkalmával. Másik AP veszélyes hely, a megszerzett kastélyépület leépítése az eddigi épületünkbe. Különböző formájú és alakú lapkák adnak egy fix pontot és még bónusz a szomszédjaikért. Emiatt is is érdemes rendesen előre tervezni. A játékban minden befejezett szoba ad még erős bónuszt. Van három nyílt győzelmi pont szerző cél, mint a Kingdom Builderben, de szerezhető titkosak is. Szóval tulajdonképpen sok újdonságot nem kapunk, de egy jól összerakott játékot igen. A játék szép, jól néznek ki az épített kastélyok és bőven van változatosság. Tetszett, de nem rohannék a boltba érte egy jól összeválogatott 100-as társaskészlet mellé új játéknak.

Sweet game!
One of those games in which you're actually building something which can be photographed and at the end you will feel rewarded even if you didnt win.
It suffers a bit for AP as during the active player's turn, waiting for him to choose which room to buy, the inactive players can sometimes feel a bit bored. Because of this, I prefer simultaneous players actions games.

3/20/2016 - initial rating after 1 play.  enjoyed this a lot more than suburbia, as the tracking of point combos is much easier to keep track of, which drives me nuts in suburbia.  the combos and figuring out which rooms go together and how to build to maximize points is a fun exercise.  but, all the bits are rather small - necessary to allow people's castles to fit in a reasonable space, but makes the game fiddly.  after playing, neither me nor my son could bear to play again right away, a problem we don't have with many games we like a lot.  i wouldn't turn down a game, and it could be a good choice in some situations, but not something i have to play.

Possibly my favorite theme of any Euro. I like the auction mechanic, I love building the castle. The game deserves better graphics on the components. There's just something that feels off about the whole thing, that I can't put my finger on. The flow feels off. It feels like your setting up combos, but there isn't a feeling of growth if that makes sense? The castles feel like little sections more than a whole. Maybe the expansion will remedy this feeling?

While similar to Suburbia, I like Castles better for several reasons.

This a very good tile placement game, although I like it just a tad less than Surburbia. Nevertheless, it's a lot of fun figuring out where to place your tiles, and the auction with a closed economy is a really nice addition. It's also less fiddly than Suburbia, but I kind of like the building up and interaction that Surburbia provides with all of the additions and bonuses each round. In conclusion, the game has a different enough feel to warrant adding this to many collections.

a tile placement game, with the goal of placing the tiles to create combos enabling you to multiply points. Scoring consists of public goals (making certain tiles more desirable), as well as private goals. 

this one didn't click for me, and i'm not sure why.  i usually like games with a spatial element, and those where you can set up a combo.  

i'd like to give it another go, as i should like this more than i do.

------------------------------------
Really fun tile-placement game with a surprisingly high level of player interaction. Each turn a player is the 'Master Builder', and has to price buildings smartly to make people pay highly for what they need, which means needing to pay attention to everyone's castles, not just your own.

Fantastic.

RATING: 6
Castles is a reimplementation of the system first seen in Suburbia but with a stronger spatial element. Castles has a bit less bookkeeping than Suburbia and adds some interesting decisions with an "I cut, you choose" mechanic to determine what each building will be worth. Mind you, there's a bit more downtime too. Besides that, it's a lot like Suburbia, for better and worse.

I got this for Christmas 2014 as something a little Euro-ey and also a little different to other games I've played/own. I really like this game as although you are playing to win, if I get to the end of the game and haven't got 1st place I don't really care because I'm so proud of my castle!

That may seem a little ridiculous to some but believe me when I say I love to win nearly as much as anyone. There are just some games that are a pleasure win or lose. The streamlined rules of Suburbia fit the theme perfectly; I particularly enjoy the pricing of rooms and simple bonus system. Very good fun.

One main downside: I don't really care for this 2p, and as it's a game I would most often play with my wife it doesn't get so much table time now.

What a beautifully designed game. Great components, solo tile building, but still highly strategic and competitive with the master builder.

Castles is a pretty fun game! Players are building their own private castles using tiles of various shapes. Each tile is a different type of room or hallway, with specific rules for placement. They come up in random order (card deck), and each round the current player sets the price for all of them; but all other players buy first. There's also a deck of bonus cards, awarding VP for a wide variety of conditions; players acquire these as they buy certain tiles. When the game ends, score points based on your builds and the bonus cards -- most VP wins!

I had a hard time figuring out how to price stuff (I tend to prefer more multiplayer solitaire-y stuff where I don't have to look at everyone else's board so much). 

Good game, better than Suburbia -- I would like to play it again!

I am admittedly a fan of very heavy and meaty games.  The denser the rules and the more varied my options the better usually.  This is to a fault as I often find myself uninterested in lighter fare which makes a good chunk of my library not very appealing to a broad group of people.

With that introduction into my tastes though know that I very much so enjoyed this game which is very light and accessible, it just charmed my pants off.  The game is going to look and feel very similar to Suburbia, also from Ted Alspach, but this time players are building a castle instead of a city.

I also really like Suburbia but this game does a lot of things that I think make it even better.  First of all instead of tiles just sliding down the cost track when bought each round the "master builder", a role passed to the next player at the beginning of each round, gets to order the tiles on the prices.  Then all the other players get to buy tiles from this list, paying the master builder, before he gets to purchase.  I love this simple mechanic that presents such deep decisions for the master builder.  Obviously he wants to make the tiles he plans to buy the cheapest but he also has to worry about other players snatching it out from under him before he gets a chance.

The varied room sizes and shapes is also another great change.  You have to take care not only which tiles you put next to which, much like in Suburbia, but you actually have to ensure the tiles you would like to place can even fit and plan ahead where you might like to put future tiles.  Not to mention it is just really intriguing to see the wacky shapes and layouts of each person's castle.

"The bathroom?  Sure, just step outside, walk through the shed and the piano room, go downstairs, through the dungeon, and then back up the stairs you will find it just through the dressing room."

This game had a really unique theme of building a castle for mad king ludwig, which I loved! Unfortunately, the mechanics of this game, specifically the pricing of the rooms, didn't quite click for me. I also thought some of the rooms were too similar in size as sometimes you need to differentiate them in terms of bonus.

Elements of Suburbia , Vegas Show Down, an auction game I can't remember....and Princes of Florence.

Worried that all points/activation are off own tableau.

1st Play. Pretty easy flow to the game, Own tableau only an issue when it comes to valuing tiles to other players. However game quick enough and tiles simple enough that it does not bother me. It appears that key to success is valuing tiles correctly - not easy to do when the  information you need might be 4ft diagonally across a table. However after 3 plays the concerns are gone. Its entertaining to price things. And in a good natured table most people announce their public goals to help the pricer (and possibly blow some smoke over their private bonus cards)

Setup is a bit of a chore, but could probably really be helped by a good insert.

It all comes down to the main mechanic for the game (the master builder phase) not being strong enough to support the game (+ AP and king making prone). So a mishmash of scoring and combos were added to keep your attention.

Add the absence of any economic incentive (why is there money in this game?), lackluster tile placement, hard to read game state (iconography is small and confusing), dull artwork, uninspired special action and you have stinker.

I don't know who King Ludwig is or what he's so mad about, but I do know that this game is better than Suburbia (which is the important thing).  There are fewer details to have to constantly keep track of than in Suburbia for one thing, and having the players choose the prices of rooms is just genius.  The names and detailing of the room tiles are a lot of fun (though I'm bitter that the Polish edition looks so much nicer than the North American one - maybe that's Ludwig's problem: he's Canadian??), and there's something pleasing about having built a castle even if you lose the game.  At the end of the day, it's one of those games that I'll happily play any time, but it's just not quite over that special line where I'd purchase a copy.

Players take it in turn to be the "Master Builder", offering various different types of rooms for a variety of prices. The other players can either pass, earning $5000, or pay the asking price and place the room in their castle.

There are various restrictions on adjacency, entrances etc., and different kinds of rooms do different things when they are "completed" (i.e., all of their exits connect to something), such as give points, money, bonus cards (worth points at the end of the game) or allow placement of another room.

It's a light tile placement game with its limited interaction provided care of the price-setting mechanism (Baby's First Container?). Much of the charm is in the rooms themselves, particularly the bizarre basements like the Venus Grotto and Secret Lair; that the tiles aren't abstract hexagons is a significant improvement over Alspach's city-building games, like Suburbia.

I liked this much better than I thought I would. It's more interesting than Suburbia in theme and mechanics. The art is only so-so; it's not as pleasant building a castle with computer generated graphics as compared to paintings. I like secret goals, room bonuses, and scoring. I don't like waiting for the master builder to arrange the rooms by price. I think a sand timer for this part would improve the game.

Definitely the worst game I have played in recent years. 
Here's why:

1) Each turn the auctioning player has to rearrange the tiles that are up for buying. That takes up a lot of time even though the auctioneer cannot really make a meaningful decision since he does not know what the other players want because of those hidden goals.
2) Speaking about those hidden goals. You get quite a few of them randomly - and even worse - you get new ones during the game, when it is probably too late to adapt to them.
3) Lousy components. Very thin cardboard and the print is so tiny that it is impossible to read anything on the tiles at a distance of more than 40 cm.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

The game itself is not that complicated once you play a time or two, but there are a lot of decisions to make. And if you play with someone like Roman he will inevitably screw up every decision you plan to make.

Improves upon Suburbia by maintaining a similar scoring system, and then adding the Master Builder and the various connection/spatial elements... it's quite fun watching your castle grow.

The visual appeal of this game is substantial. Some complaints regarding component quality are understandable.

The castle-building novelty wore off with out group.

The solo experience is drab, but overall this is a very good game.

I probably prefer Suburbia but the two games are different enough to make playing them different experiences. Love the master builder mechanic but it suffers from the same scoring problem as Suburbia (though to a lesser extent)in that there's so much to keep track of that I always feel that my score at the end is around what I actually scored rather than a definite total.

Family are loving this game and the combination of the kings favour tiles and your bonus cards which can give you a strategy of what to aim for as well as the clever master builder mechanic which will see each player per round fix the pricing of the tiles really makes this game shine. Love it.

RATING: 7
Love building the castle, but the whole "I pick the price, then you buy" can be really AP prone and can lead to one player giving the other the win. Still fun for how short it is, but I much prefer Suburbia.

I really thought my wife would like Suburbia but the tight economy and the consequences of passing each red line made her feel like the game was too punishing.  She likes sim games so I thought this would be a definite winner...swing and a miss by me.

She played Castles of Mad King Ludwig at a Meet Up and liked it enough that she bought an extra copy from a friend.  I prefer Castles to Suburbia too.  The castle tiles are fun, the builder player placing the tiles keeps the money coming in, and our 7 year old daughter (who really didn't like Suburbia) likes it too.  Winner!

RATING: 6
I really liked the spacial awareness necessary to do well in this game.  I think it could also help with awareness of what your competitors are doing as the bidding mechanism forces you to assign prices for everything.  A couple of opponents didn't fully understand end game scoring so I;d like to play again with everyone fully informed.  Has a lot of depth for something pretty simple once the symbols are understood.

Neat game. Has quite a few similarities to Suburbi, so I think I will only keep one of them. And going straight up against Suburbia for a spot on my game shelves , I think Suburbia comes out on top.

I enjoyed the actual castle building, but found dividing up the tiles very problematic. When other players were the master builder, there was very little to do except wait, which took most of the game time. When I was the master builder, I really should have been paying attention to everyone else's castle, but I didn't want to take that long - especially since the tiny icons and tiles are really hard to see from across the table.

RATING: 8
This is exactly my kind of game.  I love when I get to build my house/castle.  It feels like the descendant of California.  Pricing the rooms so other people will buy them is really the key, but don't make them too cheap!  

LOVE.

I do not generally enjoy tile builders, but this game has made me re-think this.

I enjoy being crazy and building crazy castles and this game kind of makes me feel partially insane. There are random objectives at the beginning of each game that help this feeling. You might have the goal of creating a castle with the most outside doors for example. It really aids you in feeling like you are building a castle for a crazy guy.

After playing some more, I just don't enjoy most tile laying games.  I cannot explain what I didn't like, but I didn't enjoy it.

Ted Alspach spends a lot of time on development of his games, and you can tell from this design. It is very, very streamlined, with very simple and short rules.
The game has quite some [thing=123260][/thing] in it. It also has tiles which you can buy for a varying price, the tile you buy gives you points and additional points according to what other tiles are adjacent or elsewhere in your castle. Very similar indeed. What is quite different is the I-split-you-choose mechanism which we know from games like [thing=1041][/thing]. Except here you don't make sets, you determine prices. You want to make things expensive so the other players pay you lots of money. But if you make it too expensive, they will buy something cheaper. And you want to make the tiles you want cheap, but not so cheap the other players will snatch them from under your nose.
It all works great together and it plays very nicely and quick. I'm not sure if this is as good as Suburbia, but it certainly is a very solid design.

I'm not really a fan of the genre but I liked this a lot more than Suburbia. The valuation of the tiles is the most interesting part of the game, and I wasn't too good at it being unfamiliar with how the scoring worked.

I'm guilty of many, many rants against Bezier Games, having disliked Ultimate Werewolf, One Night Ultimate Werewolk, Suburbia and even managing to dislike Start Player, so it was with some trepidation that I sat down to play Castles...

We started setting up and I saw many of the same components from Suburbia - that terrible price track that makes the game so random with more than two players, stacks of tiles that didn't look like they were all going to be in the game - all of the issues I'd had with Suburbia were flooding back to me and my heart sank.

And I'm delighted to say that they appear to have been addressed; now, tiles are repositioned on the price track by players meaning no more lucky draws determining games, there is some control over the tiles that come into play, but most imortantly you can't just simply lose because the type of tile you decided to go heavily into just isn't in the game (airports were famously bad for this in Suburbia). All in all, Castles of Mad King Ludwig delivered a really smooth, fun play experience. To the extent that it has now become the first Bezier Game in my collection - and that is quite something coming from me.

This game is better than Suburbia in every way, but maintains the exact same feeling as Suburbia.  It's a little less interactive with other people (i.e. more multiplayer solitaire than suburbia), but worlds less fiddly on the scoring.

Still has that big time random rewards on the bonus scoring though, almost too much. Only more games can flesh that out though.

I wish Betrayal at House on the Hill had this house building mechanism. I love fitting everything into place. When I first got this game I was super into it and played it a whole bunch of times in a row. Since then I find it somewhat limited. I want to build bigger castles! Sometimes it feels as though it's over before it begins. But it's a lot of fun and the mechanics provide a lot of opportunities for strategy. I could see it being replaced one day, but for now I still enjoy breaking it out.

This has become a staple game of my gaming collection and for good reason. You are putting together a blueprint for a castle filled with long hallways, music rooms, bedrooms, outdoor yards, dungeon rooms, and more in a design that you hope will please the Mad King. Players take turns as the master builder and assigns costs to the available rooms to build, then the other players buy and design their castles to score the maximum amount of points. 

What results are some wildly designed castles that are fascinating to look at. You begin looking at what other players are trying to accomplish and try to price desirable pieces high enough to get paid as the master builder. It's a blast and I wholeheartedly recommend this game.

The quality of the surface of the tile feels weak (I wish it has a linen finish), but the artwork is fantastic and it's a really great game! Easy to learn and to teach, fun experience for everyone especially at the end game!

Awesome, awesome game.  Takes what I like from Suburbia and makes it better, getting rid of what I didn't like (most of the math).  I only wish Bezier Games would use a standard board, and not the large tiles.  A board could hold everything on it, and have a normal score track, instead of the separate zig-zag track which I abhor.  

Small complaints of an otherwise great game though.

RATING: 6
Solid game for which my rating may rise with repeat plays. Similarities to Suburbia are apparent but overstated. It shares a lineage, but includes enough differences to be worth playing in its own right. That said, this feels like a looser game than Suburbia, with a more obvious thematic appeal. For example, I was repeatedly drawn to specific rooms not because they would maximize my score, but rather because I thought they would be a fun addition to my castle. In the end, it's an enjoyable experience, but not mechanically tight enough to be something I request on a regular basis.

Where is the King's bedroom? Just go through the larder, down the hallway with only 1 real door, turn right at the train room, go outside, through the servant's quarters and you are there. No, we didn't plan that well.

Another one of those great games where you can have a lot of fun in last place. Buy the right room at the right time.

It's very similar to [thing=123260][/thing], but the differences are mostly improvements.  The main thing that bugged me about Suburbia was how you [i]didn't[/i] want population in the beginning, and that is obviously gone.  The different room types are fun and thematic.  The master builder idea is really unique and makes for some tough decisions.

It's a good game that I would be happy to play more, although I doubt I will buy it.  The game ends right when you feel you're starting to get your engine running, which is usually the sign of a good game.

Gosh this really is a solid game. It's currently game of the moment and as an ex-anarchist this is minus points not plus! Despite that you can really see why, as this is not empty hype, but a very solid mid-heavy euro with a 4 page rule book, simple to learn and a real joy to play. I can see that there could be AP but our group didnt and it ran along nicely.

Enjoying this one very much. Interestingly, my wife likes it, as well, but for very different reasons. She like building the castle and looking for ways to place the rooms so that bonuses work together well. I enjoy the other half of the game more - the auctions - which involves the setting of prices and acquisition of rooms. The only real downsides to this clever little game are that the castles can sprawl right off the table if you don't have a very large play space, and the whole thing can break down if you have inexperienced or clueless players who are unable to value the rooms correctly enough to set prices well (although is is something of a danger with most auction games, here it is very pronounced with the person to the left of the poor auctioneer reaping all the benefits). In any even, there's quite a bit to like here and Castles of Mad King Ludwig seems destined to hit my game table quite a bit in the coming days.

I had expectations on this one that simply didn't line up with the experience at the end. The game marched on, slowly and finally came to an abrupt end when the deck ran out. The castles were tiny, only 10-12 rooms, meaning we  never had to worry about adjacency. The points salad is annoying to keep track of, and difficult to adjudicate, and don't even try to score points you forgot to score. Better yet, the iconography is tiny. In theory the master builder is a great mechanic, but with so much hidden information in the bonus cards, the effect is not having much control on really affecting the other players.

They got rid of everything that was wrong with Suburbia and kept all of the interesting parts and came up with this. You have to admire when a game designer realizes that they have an okay game on their hands, but with a few tweaks it could be really good.

My only real complaints are with some of the production. The back of some of the boards is this ugly grey and black, and a lot of the art throughout the game is pretty minimal and just functional. For a full-priced game like this, maybe we're spoiled, but we have come to expect much better.

Still, it's a huge improvement over Suburbia and just a fun game on its own.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Theme is very fun and the insanity of the castles is pretty amusing. Underneath the well-executed theme is a fun Euro where you really need to pay attention to those VP yields, but at the same time it manages to not scare away new players. I often don't care if I win or lose... just building an awesome castle can be enough for a good time. One knock on it is that the King's favor tiles just about never matter... they are not worth enough points to ever swing the game (and the fact that there are three or four of them mean they often cancel each other out) and thus are pretty pointless.

Well I played it and loved it. The Master Builder phase took way too long for my liking, especially for a medium weight game, but building your castle is so damn fun.

Everyone at the table was muttering things along the lines of "I love my castle" and "I am just having a blast building this thing." Talk about a great game. And the final scores were within 12 of each other after seemingly insurmountable leads? Yes please.

It's such a good theme, and we really enjoyed putting together ridiculous castles.

House ruling a time limit on turns really speeds up the game.

Not a bad experience, but I think I like the straightforwardness of Suburbia over this one. I do, however, like the finished product of this one a bit more. It's fun to see all the funky rooms in Ludwig. But in the end, I think Suburbia's smooth design outweighs this one.

It is just so different from so many other games... the castle building is immensely satisfying, and I've found that new players are drawn to this game (even if it gets a ding for the fact that a new player is almost guaranteed to get crushed, especially when pricing rooms). This is a brilliantly designed game! My only complaint is the expansion -- I want an expansion that is JUST tons of new rooms to mix and match.

I remain cheesed off after CoMKL's first time out, when that one friend who really didn't give a shit about the game or what he was doing, beat me on points after I'd been playing the ipad app for weeks. He got lucky with the King's Favor's generous score, which are absent in the app's campaign.

This is a great design with depths to the gameplay. The [lack of insert] box design and poor score track don't annoy too much.

An excellent castle building game, that is simple to learn but very interactive.

I love games that allow you to play against the other players, keeping things really simple and giving it all to the interaction. Castles of Mad King Ludwing is exactly such a game. The rules are deceptively simple, and set up the stage for an excellent drafting mechanism. As an added bonus, you are building a castle, and it's going to be completely different from game to game, with every room being unique. The game finally flows well and fast and feels really rewarding in the end even if you end up last.

The bad? Well, the components could have been better - say bigger and better illustrated. But that would end up taking more space on the table which is a different problem. Some downtime and a lot of frustration might be a bigger issue, especially with new players when they take on the master builder role, as it's often difficult to price the rooms. It's also very easy for master builders to make mistakes that swing the game heavily in one player's favor. Aka it's chaotic for the first games of any player, for all players. This is not a new player friendly game like suburbia.

Overall it's an very good game, but though pretty much everyone can play it and enjoy it, it really does need an experienced group to shine.

It would be a fine enough game, if it was not the sibling of Suburbia. For me, Castles is much worse. I don't really like all of the hidden scoring objectives because it creates too many values that I need to trade off and optimize. The engine building is not as powerful. Have a master builder price the market adds more complexity to the game, breaks the flow, and makes planning ahead harder.

Wife and I love this game.  We enjoy the castle building aspect while the auction style play of acquiring rooms adds an interesting aspect to the decision making process of each round.

Plays can get long.  For us, it's most enjoyable at 2 player.

How can castle building not be fun, especially when the players design space is so wide open? Also included is a nice twist on the "I divide, you choose" method of tile acquisition. Nice evolution of design from Ted Alspach.

RATING: 7.5
I had only a vague idea that this was some sort of tile laying game along the lines of Suburbia and wasn't sure quite what to expect. As the game was put out on the table, I was a little taken back by the number of bits and how much information you needed to absorb for each one. Trying to read the tiles was a bit of a challenge. Once you play the game a few times I'm sure you'll start to remember tiles. For the first play, I decided to ignore other player's tiles for the most part.

The primary challenge in the game is playing the master builder and valuing all the buildings that come out for the turn. You want to price buildings so that people buy them and give you money. You won't likely get any more money until your next master builder turn, so this is pretty important. You want to make the things they want to buy expensive enough that they pay you a good chunk of change, but not pricey enough that they decide not to buy.

Oh, but if the tile is too good and will score them a ton of points, you want to price it out of their range. And since you will be buying last in the turn, you want to figure out a way to price the building you really want such that it won't get bought by the other players, but will still be available to you at a reasonable price.

The rest of the game is deciding which buildings to buy, which keys into all sorts of factors. First and foremost is how much money you have left and how long it will be until you get more. But rooms score points for being built, some rooms score points for being connected to other types of rooms, and some rooms just score points for having other types of rooms in your castle. So figuring out the room that gives you the most points is a big consideration.

But then there's all sorts of placement restrictions, the first of which is simply geometry... will your room fit where you want to put it? And some rooms don't like being next to other rooms, and some rooms can't have anything adjacent to them, and some rooms are basement rooms and can't adjoin the first floor rooms without stairs. And rooms give bonuses when you complete them (which requires matching every exit to an entrance of another room) depending of the type of room. Which can give you all sorts of powerful options. And players have different personal goals and a few common goals.

Despite the myriad of things to take into consideration when choosing which room to build, pricing the rooms as master builder is still the harder part of the game. Because to accurately value things you'd need to go through the same "What should I build?" calculation for every player. Trying to do this to any degree of precision would pretty much kill the game and send it into an AP-type time distortion field. I basically shortcut this step by picking a top level note for each player (that player wants sleeping rooms, that player wants basement rooms, that player wants dining rooms) and not worrying about it too much. Thinking about it much more than that would make the game less fun and more spreadsheety... so there is at least one player that I know I'd never play this game with (Sorry, Gwen).

I really enjoyed this game. There were a lot of interesting decisions and I found the game challenging and competitive. It certainly has a certain feel of Suburbia to it, but while Suburbia feels pretty dry and themeless, I found this game much more thematically engaging. It was fun looking at the castles all of the players built and seeing what sorts of madness was going on. The cooks in one player's castle would have to take a quick romp through a nine pin bowling lane in order to get supplies for dinner? Crazy!

I felt more invested in my castle more than I ever felt invested in any city in Suburbia. How the castle developed was much more dependent on my decisions than in Suburbia, primarily due to the odd shapes and placement restrictions. You just don't see that with the hexagonal pieces in Suburbia as it's hard to muck things up too much with pieces of only one shape.

And it's much easier to view the buildings in Suburbia as generic blue/yellow/etc. hexagonal pieces whereas the buildings in CMKL with their distinctive shapes and imagery help you retain the idea that they are specific rooms with different functions.

[thing=155426][/thing] is an strategy game about tile placement, where players build their castles while paying the others for parts to use or receiving money when its their turn to set prices. 

The game revolves around managing money - as it can go really fast - while seeking the best opportunities, both to buy cheap and to take what you need to score better, as some rooms work better with others, and finishing a room (connecting all the openings) gives bonus depending on the type of room - therefore going for pieces that connect well (in a Tetris-like manner) is important also.

It is very good that the mechanisms are well done, because the game looks awful - never once I was proud of what I built, as the castles always looked bad, with loads of cornes, huge circles, corridors and others parts in odd ways - this feel was shared by the others; not the really beautiful structures we think when talking about castles - still, Ludwig is mad. Anyway, I usually enjoy games where something is built during play, yet in here I don't find this pleasure, since I know that it will likely look ugly in the end.

However, as I mentioned, the mechanics are solid and give enough to think about and to have fun with, that I don't mind the ugliness all that much. They provided several possibilities for choices and decisions, giving many paths to achieve victory. In the choice of style of substance the designer went for the proper sutff, yet i wish that [thing=155426][/thing] could have both.

Castles of Mad King Ludwig combines spatial reasoning in building a castle with valuation estimation of room tiles for other players' castles. Because a central mechanic of the game is the master builder's pricing of the room market, with all spending by other players going directly to the master builder, the game is most interesting with the maximum number of players.

The idea is nice and in the end even if you lose it feels good to look at your castle. However the gameplay itself fell flat for our group mainly because we did not like to brainstorm the optimal prices for each piece every round so the game felt a bit random since everybody just bought medium to light priced rooms that lined nicely for their secret objectives and gave some points when put into the castle. I think that this game would get better with more plays but the initial impression was not very good.

I am not sure how Castles of Mad King Ludwig is getting such high ratings. This game is purely a solitaire exercise with all players focused on building their own castles. Interaction is basically very low to non-existent. Sure, there is some jostling to pick up castle tiles, but there is very little you can do to alter other peoples selection. You just have to pick whatever is leftover when you turn comes along.
Still, the low interaction is not the biggest let down, The game is inherently fiddly. Lots of little points here and there to calculate with each move. I find that distracting and bothersome. It drains the game from momentum. The scoring categories are just too broad. For instance, every dungeon tile contributes to continuous scoring and every adjacent tile can also trigger scoring. Plus, re-scoring can occur and so can extra turns. Not to mention utility cards and king's favor scoring. All these scoring efforts makes a really thematic game cumbersome and unnecessarily convoluted. 

I really wish someone could take Castles and turn scoring around so that it has fewer scoring categories. Perhaps even one?

04/2017: Additional plays of the game with different player counts did not change my rating, but just affirmed all the shortcomings of the game. Scoring is fiddly and the spatial puzzle wasn't as immersive. It also dragged.

I haven't had enough plays to properly rate this game, but the little I have played was a lot of fun! It's a clever tile-laying game since all the tiles are rooms of varying sizes.

This is a really shallow game.  The entire game revolves around the single price setting mechanic.  You can do a few things with your own castle but the purpose here is to signal your willingness to pay to the master builder.

There is also quite a bit of down time as the master builder checks which pieces are good for which players and prices accordingly.  There is nothing for the individual players to do at this stage.

This is a fun game with interesting concepts.  I like that it really feels like you're building a castle.  The theme comes through stronger than in some other games.  However, 2P seems to end rather quickly so we alter the rules to make it a bit longer.  We haven't played it at higher player counts because there are just too many little icons and things for my parents who prefer clear cut written explanations or at least larger icons.  (It would really be less fun if we had to explain every single tile repeatedly.)

Decent game, but too fiddly for me. I dislike the need for needing every turn to have a detailed overview of everything you've built to make sure you score everything, also the proneness to make mistakes in scoring that can't be taken back and checked later bug me. The need to look at your opponents boards when pricing as master builder is positive as you can quite easily spot the key components and a mistake is not game-breaking as it is just a judgement call. I see why people like it but this game is unlikely to be played again, there are just so many better games out there.

A clear follow-on to [gameid=123260], this is virtually a reimplementation with a few tweaked mechanics and a different theme.  I prefer the first one, no doubt partially because I was introduced to it first, but it also fits better with the theme.  The idea of competing castles doesn't make much sense, nor does the idea that there's a limited number of plans that form a lot to draw from.  There's also some very artificial chaos thrown into the mix here, and if your opponents choose not to pay you for their own reasons, you can really get stuck behind the 8-ball.  The game contains a certain opportunistic playstyle which appeals to me, but it's ultimately not enough to save a very artificial-feeling pile of mechanics.

I liked Suburbia a lot. Then I played Castles of Mad King Ludwig. Shortly after I sold Suburbia. I love the feel of designing you own castle. There are a lot of small things to remember but after 2 or 3 plays the game flows incredibly well. So many ways to score points. So many choices. And the auction part of the game feels like a game within a game. The components and theme are great. A fantastic game.

The game doesn't disappoint.  The bidding mechanism is pretty much straight out of Industria, and the game is pretty much about the end-game scoring (e.g., if you're not working toward it, then you're not going to win), but the game has a nice tension and allows for a lot of neat building options.  I think it's another hit.

The theme is a lot of fun. The people I play with always seems to laugh over the crazy castle they have constructed. I like the challenge of setting the prices on your turn. Trying to make the wanted tiles high enough you make money, but low enough people buy the tiles. I also enough the secret bonus cards for end game points.

It's hard not to compare this to Suburbia, since they share so much of the same DNA. Still, the comparisons are tough because almost every aspect of it has something I like better than Suburbia and something I liked better in Suburbia as well. I like the new market, because it adds so much game space but I dislike it because it slows the game down and can just flat out not work among players of differing experience. I love the free form laying of the tiles, instead of the strict hex grid, but a dislike that a lot of the puzzle aspects are lost. (It's there in a different way, but much easier and less satisfying to work around in Ludwig). I like the tile combo chains in Suburbia much better, as they are more intuitive, but the moves in Ludwig can be even bigger, which is also fun.

I guess what I'm saying is that there isn't a good reason to prefer one over the other. I think I like Suburbia better, but there are enough new experiences in Ludwig to make owning and playing it worth while. Especially when you consider the table talk. Thematically explaining why a player built the kitchen next to the stables is the best part of the game and adds to the fun exponentially.

Final word...Suburbia is a better game, but Castles of Mad King Ludwig will make you laugh a whole lot more. Choose your fun accordingly!

Like Suburbia, I feel it's too long for what it is and not interesting enough for the length. Pricing every round is time-consuming and due to the rarity of certain tiles, those who luck into cash-engines cannot be chased.

The artwork is good, the different rooms are great. Felt new and different (I have not played Suburbia). Master builder shuffle seemed good but I am not sure it worked because you want to try and ensure you got a certain room or a lot of money if someone else got it but the only way to do it was to put it in the highest spot but then the MB has to pay the going rate so it did not feel like a benefit. Maybe the MB should get the rooms at a reduced price?  A nice game though, would like to play again and see if I can do better.

Suburbia v2
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
For the longest time, I wrote off Castles of Mad King Ludwig as an also-ran of Suburbia. It looked more fiddly with the cards and multiple tiles, and I knew my anal retentiveness would flare up with the various little rooms being disturbed from their perfect right angles. However, I’ve been doing a lot of trading lately and decided to get rid of a game I realized I wasn’t going to play and traded for this one and one other.

When it showed up, I did my normal “new” game routine of breaking everything out and organizing it as best I can given the tackle boxes I own and the plastic baggies I have on hand. After that, I brought it downstairs and it sat for a few days until my toddler was cooperative enough for me to try a solo game of it.

I was blown away. Castles is not an also-ran of Suburbia, though it’s clearly an iteration of it. The real differences come in the form of only worrying about points (and not income, reputation, and population) and paying money to the other players (when that player is the first player) instead of the bank.

Additionally, at the end of Suburbia you would have quite the city…of hexagons. It was impressive to look at from a mechanical level, but it was pretty bland looking. With Castles you have this unique castle built to your specifications with odd bits and bobs here and there. I mean, who knew you needed four gardens and no bedrooms?

Money is very interesting in Castles. In Suburbia, you always paid the bank when you bought a tile, but in Castles you only pay the bank when you’re the master builder (first player). The other players end up paying the master builder the cost of the room and it’s up to the master builder to correctly price the buildings in order to get the most money from the other players. This is done in a I-cut-you-choose mechanism where the master builder places the buildings and the other players buy and when everyone else has taken their turn, the master builder gets to buy something. I absolutely love this mechanic.

The last trace of Suburbia in Castles would be the King’s Favors. Instead of having goals where only the person who had the most gets points, now everyone gets some amount of points, just decreasing with your rank. In addition, the secret goals in Suburbia have been replaced with bonus cards which only affect you and not the other players and are typically more of a bonus for each of something or for having a certain condition, not for having the most or least of something.

All of that aside, I think Castles has some disadvantages to it. First, there’s a good deal of shuffling at the beginning, though since you’re shuffling fewer tiles, I think it’s better than Suburbia. Second, the castle rooms move around and you find yourself reorganizing more often then you like and it takes a bit more time than it did in Suburbia.

However, I just spent several paragraphs telling you that I really liked Castles and only one telling you about it’s disadvantages. I quite like this game and I’m happy I finally picked it up because this is one that’ll be in my collection for a while.

We are master builders commissioned by King Ludwig to satisfy his obsession of building the most extravagant castle ever. The meat of the game is in the auction phase. In turn order the master builders draw random blueprints to determine and arrange the price of available castle room tiles of various shapes and sizes. Unselected tiles are incentivized with a gold token. Manage your gold to build your castle with tile placement trying to achieve various tile collection objectives for points. Tie breaker goes to the largest square footage castle. Give yourself some table space for this.

What a great puzzle type game. Each game has different scoring mechanics on top of the normal ones meaning that no game ever plays the same. The way pricing works in the game is great, however it doesn't come through well in a 2 player game. I would say to really experience this game you need 4 players, although it's still plenty enjoyable at 2.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.92
Fairly abstract game about building a 2D castle by placing rooms next to each other.  Different kinds of rooms will have different effects and score differently. Rooms are bought from a row of available rooms, price low to high as you move across the row (like in Suburbia) but players take it in turn to organise the row in any way they like and then receive money from other players as they buy those rooms.

Similar to Alhumbra in that you purchase different color rooms to add to your castle, but different in that rooms grant special one-time bonuses once they are surrounded.  A lot more strategy to this game, also a lot more player interaction.  (One player each round sets the price of the rooms and that player receives payments from the others.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Not nearly as interesting as Alhambra, as there are no substantive limitations on what pieces of the castle can be placed where.  Vegas Showdown is also superior, though I'm not its biggest fan.

Also, the version I played - a very late model prototype - didn't seem to be fully developed.  The low auction prices were too low, and the high auction prices were too high.  I didn't get the impression that the designer was still making changes to the game, but I hope that impression is in error.  The game still needs work.

[i]Update:[/i]

After a second play, my comments still apply.  Moreover, the different ways of scoring (some secret, some not) are - to me - disjointed and unappealing.

My major criticism is that it's easy to set up the person to your left with cheap, tasty rooms because you don't know their secret scoring goals.  That's just silly.

The Castles of Mad King Ludwig is still in that honeymoon period of a game I really like. This rating is likely to fall a bit over time but presently I really enjoy this game.

The mechanics inform the theme and inform the mechanics. "Mad Castles" indeed. Everyone at the table constantly laughs about the stories their castles entail. The randomness is minimal which keeps the strategy/tactics on point during the game. The random elements give you extra sub goals of which there are plenty of.

The pieces are easy to organize, rules easy to learn, and the production quality is high.

I don't like to use cost as part of a rating but Ludwig is also reasonably cheap for its package which is fantastic.

I haven't played suburbia which I know is similar. But in a vacuum, Ludwig is an absolute must buy.

Everyone compares this to Suburbia, so I'll do the same. I actually like Castles better. While the theme of Suburbia may be stronger, building a castle is still a lot of fun. The biggest problem I had with Suburbia is the end game scoring. Castles solves that problem for me. The end game scoring is considerably more wild.

I will say the it feels like Castles has a little more luck than Suburbia, but I'm okay with that. What I ended up building in Castles mattered at the end, whereas I didn't feel that way in Suburbia.

But I'm still giving them the same score...a 7.

UPDATE: Moving this up to an 8. It's just that much fun. It's also the first and only game that I've played solo, and I can't wait to play it solo again.

UPDATE: Moving it to a 9. Honestly, I want to play this game so often, that it should be a 10. We'll leave it at a 9 for now.

UPDATE: It's a 10 now. It's not the type of game that I would say is one of my favorites, but the fact is that it's just that good. Everyone I teach (gamer and non) loves it. And I still want to play it all the time.

I saw a documentary on the real (and not really mad) King Ludwig just before I first heard about this game, and immediately knew I wanted it. I think it's a bit more expensive than it needed to be for a box with so little in it, but on the whole, I like it a lot.

There's the fun of building an extremely eccentric castle, and the satisfaction of getting nice synergy between rooms, and the brain-meltingness of trying to decide how to price the rooms when you're Master Builder.

But it has some serious production issues, in particular the pathetic flimsy multi-piece boards for putting the cards and tiles on and keeing the score, and the annoyingly hard-to-read zigzag score track. The art is pretty feeble too, although the rooms tiles themselves are quite nice.

It's also longer than I'd consider ideal, and removing tiles for 3 and especially 2 players is annoyingly fiddly, and can also harm your ability to achieve some bonuses (you can just use the setup for 4 players, but it will take even longer).

Really good game.  It's fun to see the unique shapes of each castle as they develop.  There can be some really funky ones!  The master builder mechanism is pretty neat -- it's a mini-game of pricing your competitors out of the market, while still keeping pieces cheap enough that you can afford them and want to actually pay the asking price. Overall, it's a lot of fun.

Building up your castle is actually pretty fun! The possibilities for combos seem absolutely limitless... Unfortunately this can be quite the calculating game, tho, especially as the master builder. There is so much pressure on him, and the master builder's turn drags the game down quite a bit. But other than that this is very good game with quite a bit of freedom and strategic possibilities with what you can do. Would certainly play again (although it would depend on how quickly everyone is able to make their moves).

I greatly enjoy the sense of building something in this game and in other games.  Many have commented on not enjoying the master builder aspect of this game but I find it to be a necessary mechanic in the game and one that adds tension and enjoyment to other players.  The game is great at all player counts and is very thematic with is a nice change from many other euros.  As an added bonus, my wife loves the game so this is a definite keeper.  One downside to the game, is the components are very cheaply produced.  The cardboard is thin, but it is sturdy.  The game has iconography but it is very easy to understand.  Castles of Mad King Ludwig is one of our favorite games and as I said before, I love how when you're done with the game, even if you lose, you feel like you have built something cool and unique.

Jury out. Lighter than I expected and slightly underengaging... need to try again.

Initial issues:
Game is just order 8 tiles, buy tiles repeat, repeat repeat zzzz
We seem to have no idea of how to evaluate the way in which to order tiles, we couldn't be bothered to study every other players castle which is the only effective way of doing it. 
In the first half of the game, players just buy the four cheapest rooms each turn, at the end if you have a bit of money you buy anything. 
Quite solitary, other players just do things and you nod.

Aside from that it's a delightfully meaty game.  The pricing-of-rooms mechanic is excellent, though it can lead to some AP.  Experience is a HUGE bonus in this game.

This game is great. The building/buying mechanic makes for tons of fun and also incorporates tons of strategy. The fact that there are so many different ways to score points (between the common goals, each player's secret goals, and the different bonuses for each completed room) keeps the game fresh because you'll always find yourself coming up with a different strategy each game since some rooms that seemed completely worthless in the previous game suddenly become the most sought after and pricey in the next, and vice versa. Plus, it's just fun to build your own castle!

Excellent game. The mechanics are really simple and easy. The auction provides a good bit of strategy. The spatial reasoning provides some tough choices. And in the end you're left with a custom and gorgeous castle.

Fun and thematic. The weight is a bit high for casual play -- the basics of play are very easy to learn, but playing *strategically* calls for more than I can expect from casual players. On the other extreme, we sometimes need to pull hardcore gamers out of analysis paralysis as there are so many things one could weigh in each decision.

An ok game, but gets a bit repetitive, and I don't really want to spend lots of time analysing each persons castle to work out the optimum place to put each room in the auction

Tile-laying game about building a fantastical Bavarian castle, that also has a great market mechanic for the various rooms available each turn. Scoring can be tricky and complex at first, but the game is very tactile and offers great opportunity to build bizarre castles.

Theme: Medieval castle building
Mechanic: Tile placement
Ideal players: 2-4
Length: Medium

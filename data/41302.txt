RATING: 7
So wonderful for 2-year olds. My daughter loves this game. We're not just learning to take turns, roll die, and move pieces; it has the perfect amount of decision-making for her age (which fruit to take when you roll basket). Even my 1 year old liked to roll the dice, grab one of those awesome wooden pieces of fruit that I pointed to, and put it in the basket. Highly recommended if you want to start indoctrinating your toddlers into our hobby haha.

Very good game for a two year old, I'd heartily recommend it. A bit bemused by the low ratings for this one, not sure what people expect from it.

Big, colourful bits. The dice is nice and chunky and will help teach about taking turns, how dice work (i.e. read the top, no rerolling, etc), and it is cooperative so no one "loses".

My little guy really likes this game, and feels it is his duty to make sure that the raven is "a good eater."
Sets it up by himself, and brings the dice to anyone around to get them to take their turn.

Suffice to say, we'll be keeping this one for a few years at least, and then likely gifting it to someone else with young children.

The rating is my evaluation of how well my kid likes it, not how I like it as an experienced player of games.

Not quite at the Go Away Monster or Monkey Madness level for the youngest but certainly a keeper. I feel the bird should be more aggressive. I might loose some of those path squares. That bird just never gets rolled, I think Haba have weighted the dice.

Great game for our 2-year-old! She loves it and "got" it almost immediately. First game, the crow's progress down the path toward the orchard gave her a fright, but she got over it and was soon making jokes about the bird. (A 2-year-old's jokes, but jokes none-the-less!)

Rating for us? 5-6 (we'll never say no to playing it, but that's because we're playing with our daughter). Rating for her? 10.

UPDATE (2017): Now nearly 4, she's almost actually outgrown this one. Can play (and dictate what everyone else should play) quite fluidly, frequently invents rules to change up the gameplay and keep things interesting.

Will likely soon pass this one on to our youngest (now 11 months).

As I'm not the real target audience for this game, my rating is influenced by my daughter's opinion (she's 3 and a half at the time of this comment).

It's basically a co-operative dice game with almost pure luck with only one side of the die where you have a decision (free choice which fruit you put in the basket).
The wooden components are very big, so that they can't be swallowed. They are very sturdy with bright colours and even after (accidentally) dropping them they have no visible marks (yet).
Sandra really enjoys the game and quickly learned how to set it up, but doesn't play it alone and instead comes asking for mama and/or daddy to join.
Because of all other toys potentially distracting her, she doesn't finishes all of the plays or evolves the game into another game during play :).

A great game as the first game, since a two-year-old can play this. Fruit can be used as play food, too, but unfortunately they are small enough to fit in child's mouth.

Since it is a very simple game, children grow out of it quite quickly; four-year-old children can play much more complex games than this and this one rarely gets played.

Got it for my 2.5 y.o. daughter. Her first board game! She loves it. The rules and gameplay are straightforward. The design itself lends to a fun and exciting cooperative experience. The only concept that was tricky for her was the "wild card" or basket roll of the die. But taking turns, recognizing colors, manipulating game pieces, setting up the board -- all within grasp and dad loves that.

Context: As a dad, I created this account solely for rating kids games as to how good they are to play with actual kids. It didn't seem right to evaluate them vs. the strategy games I rate on my main account, so if you look at this account's other ratings, they are completely ratings for children's games. Based on play with a 2-2.5 year-old:

The equivalent of Candyland, where there are no choices, but rather following a simple rule of rolling a die, and picking a fruit of the matching color. One side of the die depicts a crow, which moves him down a path toward the orchard. The goal is to pick all the fruit before the crow makes his way into the orchard.

So, there's no decision-making here or anything too interesting for anything other than the youngest of kids. This is very suitable for a kid's very first game, as it's a simple as simple can be.

The pieces are very nice, and have play value outside of the game, as is the case with most games in HABA's "My Very First Games" series.

Infants view: another great game for her, but she's somewhat afraid of the raven and sometimes wants to play without him.

Parents view: good game, this is a childrens game that even has some decision making in it (when rolling the basket). Cooperative games are always nice with children.

Awesome components.

First Orchard is baby's first co-op game! Each player rolls the die to find out which fruit gets put into the community basket. The goal is to pick them all before the crow (who's also on the die) advances all the way to the orchard.

Big wooden pieces for the fruit are great for a kid's hands, as is the large die. The only issue we ran into is that it was hard for Henry to understand why the crow just moves forward and then stays put. That being said - fast fun for a group!

I would rate this much higher if it weren't so expensive.  It will teach rolling, colors, fear of ravens, and not much else.  It's a very, very basic game (as advertised).  My catch is the cost.  $24 for a short duration game?  (And by duration, I mean ages 2 to 4--max, probably 2 to 3 yea-olds).

First Orchard is all random dice rolls to determine which fruit you pick up and when the crow comes for the fruit. This game really shines as a method for teaching young children about the frameworks of modern games - turn order, rules, win/loss conditions, winning and losing. The components are fantastic for little hands and the visuals are colorful enough to bring children in. I've played this a number of times with my 3 year old and I'm always willing to play when he sets it up.

kids' rating.  1-4pp; age 2 and up.  the 2 year old gets a little bored b/c of the length of the game, but the 3 year old gets into the game - "No, crow, don't eat our fruit!"  focus is on colors only; the blue on the die is lighter than the blue of the fruit, so that's sometimes confusing.

after 20 plays, upgrading rating to a 10.  4 year old and 2 1/2 year old no longer need to be coached each turn, and are beginning to really play the game.  Can't ask for more.

Aug, 2017: 40th play. This is still requested by my oldest at age 5 1/2. So, this game certainly has staying power! He was in charge of moving the crow and had so much fun making "caw" noises whenever we rolled a crow. This is a FANTASTIC children's game.

But great wooden fruits, lovely trees and good for free play also.

The gamer's commentary on Candy Land is that it's useful for teaching little kids how to take turns, right? Do it with this instead. There's just a hint of decision-making thrown in (one die face is wild), and rolling a die is better than drawing a card. Or, at least, the die is way more durable than a deck of cards. Plus, the game is always progressing towards the end -- that's important in a kids' game. And the fruit pieces are big and chunky, great for letting the toddler chew on.

Rated as a very early kids' game (which is how it's marketed)

Le verger est une référence dans les jeux pour jeunes enfants, mais il n'est réellement accessible qu'à partir de 3 ans, ou 3 ans et demi.

C'est ultra simple, toujours coopératif, et toujours très beau. Un premier jeu idéal.

I really like the components, they are rather cute. The gameplay is all about rolling a die and only if you get the basket you can choose which fruit you take. So it's not really too much of a game but I still enjoyed this one much more than other games marked for 2+ yo I've played. It is very exciting when you can move the bird. In our games there is usually a traitor who wishes to move bird a bit too much and so we keep losing to it...

This has been the best children's game we have purchased for my 2 year old son.  He is fully able to comprehend rolling the dice and then putting the colored fruit into the basket.

This is the only game ("so far")I would recommend for a child under 3 years old.

I'd rank this very highly as a very young children's game (like a 9). It's obviously not for adults but it's actually fun to experience with young children. My daughter loves the bird and I was able to get her to roll the die and move the corresponding fruit. She's just over 2 years old and there aren't many games one can play with kids this young so this game wins points for that.
It's not intended for adults and there's really no strategy to it, just roll the die and move the corresponding fruit, but for young children who just need to learn shapes, colors, counting, and basic rules, this game fulfills its purpose.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
There's honestly not much of a game here. It's cooperative: all players work together to harvest fruits off of four different trees and into a basket. They do this by rolling a d6 that has each fruit represented once, plus a wild, plus a crow. Each time the crow is rolled, it advances one space on a path toward the orchard. If any fruit remains in the orchard when he reaches the end of the path, he eats what's left and the players lose. If the players harvest all the fruit before the crow gets to the end of the path, they win. 

It has no real decision-making, aside from deciding which fruit to move if you roll a wild. But it's fun and my kids both love it. My daughter in particular is enjoying how she has "her own" games now, and can request that we play. She can even organize it herself if I say "I'd love to play with you once I'm done washing dishes; can you set it up and I'll be right in?" Four plates later and the game is ready to go, and she's proud of having done it herself. 

Great components, and it's worth $20, absolutely. My son is older (5.5) and is able to handle more advanced games just fine. My daughter (2.5) is not able to handle much beyond this at the moment, but this is a great introduction to taking turns and setting up a game. Those lessons matter. She also likes to taunt the crow.

A Christmas 2010 present to Viola, and the first board game she ever played. An excellent game for the very young, possibly the only one I know of a two-year old can actually play! Featuring sturdy German wooden components.

Not great. It's cooperative, teaches colors, motor skills, and turn-taking. The components are spectacular. The game, however, is non-existant. I'd rather play Candy Land, which at least has a sense of adventure.

My 2 year old loves this game and asks for "apple fruits game".  She follows directions to roll dice, see the color, pick up the fruit that's red, ok now wait for daddy to take a turn.  Not perfectly, but did well right off the bat.

An fun little kids game. Our kiddo is still a little to young to understand and comprehend the rules but she enjoys the large, chunky fruit pieces.

Great game to start out, teach numbers, colors, setup, and take down.  Nice that it is a cooperative game.  My daughter loves it!

Not much fun, but one of the few games we found that we could play with our 3yo twins.

kids were scared of the crow at first, crying when it appeared on the die. Later they started to play with it every time it appeared, using it to "eat" all the fruits on the trees and basically ending the game for a new one of their own.

Difficult if you like to play by the rules :)

The original standard edition is a gem. This one, the animals are way small. Still, it helps if you have better hand eye coordination. This game is a classic for a reason.

Haba games are great. This is a great first game.  Nice wooden pieces that are fun for my grandson to play with.

It's part of games that are good for children but without interest for adults. But for 2-4 years old, there is quite no games enjoyable by adults, except the pleasure to make your children learn something.

Great first game for 2 or 3 year olds.  Wonderful, chunky components...but what else would you expect from Haba?

One solo play to learn the game. Obviously I'm not in the target group, but may be in couple of years I will play this again. Simple co-op with not too many decisions. Good quality components.

My toddler (aged 12 months) likes having a special colourful box that he is allowed to open. He is not allowed to play with mummy and daddy's special colourful boxes.

He is currently a bit too young to enjoy the game, but he likes throwing the dice (and fruit). The fruit is very tactile and appealing to a one-year-old child.

Hopefully he will enjoy the game as he gets older - rather than just playing with the bits.

Really great game to play with my kids! My 2 year old really likes it. As an intro to board gaming, I don't mid sitting down to play this one (I'm looking at you chutes and ladders...*shuddder*)

A fantastic first game. Work on colors as you try and defeat the wicked/hungry raven or just pull out the amazing wooden fruit and have a pretend picnic party!

Ok so my rating would probably be a 5, but the girls are probably looking at a 9. This is the first game my 2.5 year old twins have actually played rather than free-played with. They understood the rules in the first game - I was amazed. They played 3 in a row in the games first outing. They needed guiding but they understood turn taking and picking the colour that corresponds to the die without issue. Both loved the chunky components!

Rating from my daughters point of view! She's 5 and still asks to play this game, my 1.5 year old likes to roll the die and is overall interested too though can't grasp the concept yet. The chunky wooden pieces are great, it's cooperative and the theme is easy for little children to understand. They don't mind loosing the game either as the bird has to eat as well. All in all a brilliant game for 2-4 year olds.

This scores an 8 not because I love it myself, but it does what it's trying to do really well by introducing young children to board games. The basket option avoids it being completely random like a lot of games for really young children and it's interesting to watch them think about which colour they should take.

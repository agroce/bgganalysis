Backed the game on KS. Absolutely gorgeous artwork, which probably bumps this up a little in terms of rating. 

Nice little filler game which is pretty easy to introduce to new gamers , and also small enough to sneak around in my backpack. As some pointed out, it is AP prone, and can be slightly mean at times (for those who don't like directly attacking an opponent). However, that being said, the actual mechanics are pretty smooth, and the strategies involved to rack up different chains vary from game to game depending on how bright your opponents are. And completing an incredibly long chain after meticulous planning can be pretty satisfying.

Oh , and did I already mention that the art is really pretty?

It should come as no surprise that I'm a fan of this game--I'm publishing it!  I think what I love most about Project Dreamscape is that it can be a hefty brain burner, but usually never takes more than 30 minutes to play regardless of whether you're playing with two, three, or four players.  Because the game length is tied to the deck, it consistently makes for short and thoughtful plays.

All eight of the original dream types, by themselves, are pretty mild.  It's chaining the actions together that really makes the game sing. I'm incredibly proud to have Undine on the box.

Guilty pleasure given I was drawn to it at first due to its eyepleasing art. I really like the theme and mechanics for it! Odd theme, odd layout and looks like an interesting puzzle.

My wife and I love to play this game together. It is really simple to get the hang of and different dream types create a ton of interesting and unique scenarios. Overall it is a great game to play with a small group of people, especially if you can mix in some of the more difficult dream types!

Fun 2P game. Easy rules, possibilities for long combo chains make it interesting, and the art is nice.

After being taught by the designers I thought this was a very good game.  It is short with a lot of interaction and a lot more choices per play then most card games I've tried.  I'm glad I have it kickstarted.

After playing a few more games I think I would have to say this is my second favorite short filler.  Plays best with two or three and I play with a house rule that allows play after the official end game up to the original start player to allow the same amount of turns per player.

The variety of dream types are great and would add to the game's replayability, but scoring issues essentially ruin the game for me. For example, a chain of 6, scores equal points to 5 sets of 2, and since these chains can overlap, both of these scenarios require the same amount of cards. The problem is that creating long chains is very difficult, while making several small chains is incredibly simple. Thus the game boils down to creating as many 2-3 chains as possible, which is far less fun than trying to create a few lengthy chains.

There is something comfortable about the easy logic behind this game -- building chains and having actions that affect the building process in various ways.  We both appreciated having an exposure to the game design itself.  
After playing in a resort common area, we lent it out twice. Both families had positive feedback.  Good for kids.  We will keep this with our travel game pack.

This is a filler card game where you purchase cards from the center (on a sliding scale, a la Through The Ages) to add to the chain of cards you are building in front of you. Each card has two symbols and two special actions. When you take a card, you pick one of the special actions and add the card to your chain. At game's end, you look for chains of two or more of the same symbol and add up points per a chart depending on the length of the chain.

I decided to kickstart this because the gameplay seemed decent for a filler and I really liked the art. Seems my taste in art does not match that of the household. My fiance hates it and my 8-year-old daughter is creeped out by it ("Are those zombies??") and it is too much pastel for my 13-year-old son. 

The main problem with the game, however, is not whether the art appeals, but the game play. This ends up a tweener game. Too finicky and thinky for my daughter and too light for adults - or at least the adults I play with. I got it as a potential family game, but it's not really hitting the mark like I'd hoped. I'd even keep it if the solo game was good, but it is a "beat your own score" game, not one with win conditions, and it is hard for me to get interested in those sorts of solo games.

Plays a bit like Dominoes but with card powers! Anyway your trying to match up your cards as you place them and the powers let you move earlier cards in the chain to increase the possibilities of matching more. Great little game for two players. Amazing artwork too.

I really do love this game, but I feel it plays best with 2 players, ok with 3 players, and not so good with 4 players.   The AP potential of this game is very high and it goes up with each player because you ultimately will have to plan on your turn since the board changes constantly.  This also makes a highly strategic game much more random, and the planning is the funnest part of the game!  

Chaining dreams is really fun, and there is lots of strategic potential.

The art of this game is some of the best game art around!  I absolutely love it! 

So long story short play this as a 2 player game and it is fantastic.

A really charming 2 player that had a uniquely beautiful art style and was created by a couple who understood the need for 2-player games with good interaction.  It just wasn't coming to the table for us.  I do not find it to be a bad game at all, we just always found ourselves reaching for something else.

Onirim set-building + deck builder. Expansions included in the box. Solo. Great artwork. Use the side of the box as a player aid for the scoring.

Don't like the upside down text or the non-standard names for common game terms.

Need to try the solo game with some of the expansion cards to see if that makes it more challenging.

Also need to try the token variant.

I have played this a couple of times on 2 player but no other player count. The scoring favours lots of small chains and there is little to no incentive to get longer chains. Buy a heap of 2 chaining type cards and more cards, more chance to win - simples!

Brilliant! Great games do come in small packages.

There are some thought provoking moments and it can get interesting when playing a card jumps you around from card to card.

It's important to try and manipulate the cards to ruin opponents dream sequences but just as important to be thinking ahead of your dream to gain cards that will assist in your ability to keep on dreaming the same dream.

This one is definitely a keeper. Excellent gameplay and artwork.

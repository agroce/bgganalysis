I liked this game a lot more than I thought I would.  I dislike deduction games, mostly because there's so much of an attached memory element.  Even [b]Mr. Jack[/b] (which professes to be no-memory) still employs some memory.  This game is more observation and puzzle-solving.  Now, the graphic design isn't my favorite: they should have color-coded the people, locations, and crimes separately.  Almost seems like the luck element is a little strong, but I guess that's what 3 rounds is for.  But otherwise, a very fun and clever game!

Update: Upgraded to an 8.  It's like racing to finish 3 games of Minesweeper at once!  :)

I did not expect to like the game or to be good at it... I was wrong about the first part. Being my first deduction game i came last with almost no points but i loved the game. Knowing a bit of probabilities helps, but not a lot. Intuition and reading people helps a lot more. Overall a game which deserves more attention

Was expecting something that let you play more of a P.I., figuring out what's going on, following leads, etc. Instead this is a re-implementation of Master Mind and is just as dull. Rules are not particularly well written. Luck is a big factor. Happily got rid of it.

Out of all the deduction games I've played (Clue, Mystery of the Abbey, Sleuth, etc.), I think this is probably my favorite.  While I find it overproduced and not particularly impressive in the art department, it worked very well for us on a first play, and seems like it could have potential as a gateway-type game.  I think a bright and beautiful retheming could really make this one shine.

Nagyon jó kis dedukciós játék! Furcsa volt közvetlenül a Tajemnicze... után játszani, mert mindkettőben megvolt a cluedo alapkoncepciója: kit hol hogyan öltek meg? Itt is nagyon egyszerű az alapmechanizmus, de minél többen játsszuk, annál kuszább lehet a tábla. Sajnos a grafikai világa nem a legszerencsésebb, kell pár kör, mire megszokja az ember. Nem értem, miért nem lehetett eltérő színű keretet rendelni a három kategóriához. A tippelés lehetőségét pedig talán kihagytam volna belőle, de anélkül meg színtiszta levezetés lenne, szóval valahol ezt is megértem, és végül is bünteti a tévedést. Ami tipikus, hogy valaki 50%-os esélynél kockáztat. Ötletesek azok a lapkák, amelyeken nincs áldozat/helyszín/megölési mód, ezek nehezebben kijátszhatóvá teszik a játékot. Ezzel együtt nem az a játék, amivel több százat játszanék, de családi könnyednek jó.  Tetszett!
Ja még valami: akinek a lapjait megkapjuk, annak kicsit keresztbe tudunk tenni, ezért egyáltalán nem mindegy, ki mögött ülünk:)

The game play itself is good enough.  But, there is a huge problem for me.  The graphic design choice is horrible.  It is almost impossible to read all of the writing, with the exception of the tokes that state "No Crime" and "No Suspect".  Also, when sitting on the side or at the top of the board it is even harder to read. The colors and font of the text also add to the problem.  I have dropped the rating 2 points for this.

2012. 2-5p. 45 min. light deduction game, M. Wallace.

Others say: too much randomness, too easy if you get a lucky guess, deduction is too simplistic/rudimentary.

Dan King (Game Boy Geek) says it has too much randomness (i.e., not a pure deduction game), specifically someone could get lucky with an inquiry and find out almost exactly what 3 cards they have, meaning that they'll easily win that round (of 3 rounds)... and maybe this will even out points-wise over the 3 rounds (since it's a VP-based game) but maybe it won't even out.  Dan only recommends the game if you don't mind a moderate amount of randomness with your deduction games or if you want a deduction game for 2p b/c it works well, especially with the alternate 2p scoring method posted on BGG.

This game has way too much luck for a deduction game. The layout of where your three clues are on the board can give you a huge advantage or disadvantage, and there's nothing you can do about it.

The rules are also poorly written.

Big hit with the family. This deduction game is a real gem, quick to play and thinky enough to be a game, but enough random elements to make it replayable.

Only change we use is: deal 2 of each card to each player, and you select the case file for your opponent from those (and discard the others face down). Means you avoid case files where all the parts are in one location and you get to eliminate 6 from your own case - which speeds things up a bit.

Just read the rules.  Looks like an interesting deduction game.  Winner is the player who scores 3 mini-games the fastest.  Each player is trying to discover the location/crime/suspect that the player to their right is holding using a mastermind type mechanic (disc - got it right, cube, an adjacent location has the right one).  You also have 3 super-clues that you can use one-time over the course of the entire game (i.e., across the 3 mini-games) that give you more info.  Looks like it'd be fun to play.  If it ends up being cheap (yeah, right), I'll get a copy.

Wow, I really disliked the presentation.  There are 3 types of tiles and cards and they made them all the same color, and the color they picked was a dark orange with all UPPERCASE print making the game just a giant headache to play.

This is annoying! I want to like the game so badly, and I actually do, but… Everything is ruined by the randomness and luck factor which weighted much more than skillfull play – and that’s a shame! There are several degrees of randomness in the game. From the cards in the card row which may or may not be the cards you want (if you need some specific cards in order to deduce something and they don’t pop up, that’s just bad luck) to the randomness of your first question. And this last part is my main gripe with the game as it’s so random! You ask if there are any clues in a certain area, and then you can get a cube or more cubes or discs or even 0 cubes; if you get 1 cube it’s such a horrible start compared to someone who gets more or even a disc or even 0 cubes as they have now narrowed the potential areas down a noticeable size! 

Yes, deduction is definitely still the chore mechanism of the game, and a good player will probably win most of the time, but if you’re equally skillfull the lucky player will win the vast majority of the games simply because he can get a lot of lucky information in the beginning of the game… And luck/randomness certainly doesn’t belong in a deduction game! Sure, you play 3 games, so the luck should be somewhat mitigated, but it’s definitely not enough. 

I like that you get more points for deducing faster than the other players (and that you get negative points if your deduction is incorrect), but the thing is that it’s not the better player who will make the deduction faster than others, it’s the one who got lucky in the beginning of the game and 100 % randomly just managed to take a wild shot at a position on the board. The cards can be shuffled in a way so you’re basically just lucky, not good… And I even won my one and so far only play of PI! Now, I wouldn’t mind to play it once or twice again, because it’s quick and you still need to think and make correct deductions. I would probably have rated it 7+ if it wasn’t for the fact that luck can trump skills…

As a fan of logic puzzles, I have a soft spot for deduction games.  What I especially like about this one is the absence of note-taking -- the cubes and discs actually function very well, and as another BGGer noted, P.I. feels quite a bit like a game of Minesweeper.  As many have noted, the graphic design here is not ideal - tiles are not easy to find just by glancing at the board - but once you've gotten your bearings, this isn't quite as much of a hindrance as I'd initially expected.  It can also go on a bit long at times, but this can be easily corrected by playing fewer rounds if the group isn't in the mood for the full 3.

On the first day of Spiel 2012 I was very near the front of the queue. I had studied the route to the Treefrog stand and I rushed to ear end of hall 5 as quickly as my legs would carry me.

I said hello to the Treefrog staff and plonked myself down at the fist able with a set of P.I. on it. I was very quickly joined by an American gent, another Englishman and a German lady.

I was so excited to be at Spiel for the I first time, be at the stand of my favourite designer and when Martin sat down with us to explain the game, I was very glad.

I wasn't sure that I was going to enjoy the theme as it isn't one that I have really explored much. Mind you I didn't know much about Cornish mining and I rate Tinner's Trail fairly highly. I was looking forward to a Wallace game providing some education as well as enjoyment.

I was disappointed. I thought Martin might have been joking when he introduced P.I. as a cross between Cluedo and Mastermind but it soon became apparent he was deadly serious. The first round took about forty minutes including a rules explanation. Players try to deduct who committed what crime, where. A la Cluedo. They use drawn cards to select locations, criminals or crimes that narrow down the possibilities. Sort of a la Mastermind.  It was very light and lucky. After the first round we fled the scene of the crime. 

I noticed over the course of spiel that the Treefrog stand was generally busy and I think they sold out of their Doctor Who card game but the games on offer served to indicate the more mainstream, commercial course that Treefrog is taking these days. Can't blame them for that and maybe it is good for Treefrog to be attractive to the general populace but I can't give this game higher than a 4 as I don't really want to play it again.

RATING: 7.5
Familiar? Perhaps... in that mood. This game has good provision of inductive and deductive mechanisms, so it seems a good think game. You can (must!) bluff your fellows for better performing and luck is mitigated by two factors: detective tiles and mean of three mini-games. I have played at present only one partial game (one mini-game), but I feel good tension and very exciting development. I don't know if it will survive enough for replayability, but for now I like it.

Update: more matches. It is not a game for many consecutive plays, but it works very good, it is funny when you are familiar with cards and board and you can play with any age player.

A solid, but abstract, deduction game - it is simultaneous  'Mastermind' meets 'Cluedo', which is fine and fun as far as it goes.

What M.W. is usually very good at though is managing to  engage the theme, and that is missing here, which is a shame given it's a good theme. There is really only the artwork on the cards/tiles, which is very good, to evoke the world of Sam Spade and the hard boiled film-noir detective. So pasted on is the theme this could be a Knizia.

It feels like it needs an extra mechanic over and above the deduction one to really hit the mark - perhaps something to do with movement or having enough combat/investigative points to be able to place an investigator in an area or 'some-such'.

One other slight negative - although the artwork is good, it does have a few functional niggles. The locations, crimes and suspect cards/tiles should be colour coded - they all have the same scheme which does make it easier to make mistakes when giving info to players. Also, the board areas could be more clearly distinguished. The font size/choice used on the board and tiles for locations/suspects/crimes could also have been better - it's not always easy to read them from the other side of the board, especially when it's upside down (the board is not so crowded that the location names could not have been printed both ways up).
        
The functionality of the graphics cost it nearly a full point for me - picking legible fonts is just such an obvious thing to do.

I'm pretty sure I will still play this and enjoy it, but it does feel like a slightly missed opportunity.

This is a decent deduction game in which players work to solve different crimes (held by a neighboring player so each person's answer is different).  Players have limited amount of investigator markers to use to figure out the suspect, type of crime, and crime scene location.  There is some luck to the game because the distribution of the clues can make solving your crime harder or easier.  However, the game is played over 3 rounds to somewhat mitigate the luck.  Not a bad game.

[10 plays] I enjoy playing this, and love the whole cinema noir art design, but am not quite happy with the scoring system. We've devised an alternate one, but it's still less than ideal.

Excellent deduction game, with a lot more than first meets the eye. A small amount of luck, if you make a lucky guess early on, it gives you a big edge. If your 3 elements are all close by, than a detective will give a lot of info, saving several turns. The converse is true too, bad luck can delay you. But it really does boil down to paying attention, and not making logical errors.

The graphic design is excellent, way above Treefrog's usual standard. The rules on what happens to the lone player at the end of a round need clarifying. Otherwise, top value if you like deduction games.

"Clue meets Minesweeper" is a very apt description. The game is fairly solitary because each detective is working a separate case and there is very little opportunity for interaction (in fact, taking clue cards that another player might want is the maximum extent but that can be significant and a clue of its own). In any case, the game boils down to a race of who manages to solve their three cases first. The deduction element is rock-solid yet carries quite a bit of luck because, like in Minesweeper, accidentally selecting a good starting spot for your guesses can be a huge help.

Unlike Clue, P.I. requires no note-taking as all hints are readily available right on the board. That said, those hints could also signal your opponents as to when you're about to solve your case so sometimes it's better to still keep things to yourself.

The game is easily explained, runs quickly, and still offers a reasonable challenge. If a little luck in the starting conditions (supposedly, you need to solve three cases so that there is a chance of that evening out) doesn't deter you P.I. is a good choice. Due to its solitary nature, playing with the full complement of 5 players probably isn't, however.

Ein Deduktionsspiel aus Mastermind und Cluedo mit dem Martin Wallace einige Anhänger vor den Kopf gestossen haben dürfte. Die stilistische Reminiszenz an Film Noir, Detektiv- und Polizeifilme ist thematisch stimmig, wunderbar anzusehen und gibt das Spielgefühl wieder. Die Zeit ist knapp im Kampf gegen das Verbrechen. Und Glück braucht man auch bei der Ermittlungsarbeit in dunklen Straßenschluchten.

A disappointment for me as a Martin Wallace fan; expected this to be a bit more than glorified Mastermind. He probably meant to design a family-style game with the similar level of depth as Discworld, but somehow Discworld comes out quite a bit more fun. I guess it's fine for what it is, but if I wanted to play deduction-based murder mystery, I'd play Mystery of the Abbey over this any day of the week.

Clever for what it is, but wore out its welcome well before the third of its practically identical acts. Fragile in that if a player provides incorrect information -- as I unwittingly did in my first game -- then you've screwed up the game for everyone for at least the next twenty minutes. The components are individually attractive but don't go together very well, and it can be difficult to scan and scan again trying to pick out the different bits of cases. Could have benefitted from a play aide letting me strike suspects off my list. Flat and tedious overall, a shame as I like the designer and am a fan of the theme.

Good but not very good first impression. Pure deduction, no bluffing allowed – we like that and the theme in general.

Material is second-class: no inlays; the board itself is a little too colorful. Looking forward for more plays with more people. Rating after more plays.

(In a two player game one should consider the alternative scoring from the BGG forums.)

I guess in a not-so-casual gamer group this would be a 45min opener. As a closer this may required too much deductive thinking. Or maybe two beers spice things up. Not sure ;)

Decent deduction game but might be more luck-prone and the scoring system seems a little off.  In my second game we played with a house rule for the scoring and that improved my opinion of the game.  I like how you don't need to take notes since the info is on the board and I like the penalty for giving incorrect info.  I like playing this game but right now do not feel that I need to own it.

Really enjoyed this deduction game. Reminds me of playing Sudoku. I like how each player is trying to solve a different case. The board looks nice but it could have been better designed so that each area was separate from the next.

Really enjoying this but by the third round I feel it outstays its welcome plus drains the players brains. In the future I'm sticking to two rounds and warning the players more about tie Breakers as I suspect they'll be more vital.

It reminds me the classic deduction game, Digit Baseball. PI gave me a big disappointment. It is even worse than the classic deduction game, Digit Baseball. Digit Baseball can be played with a pencil and a piece of paper. But, PI is not. Considering the fame and the game price, PI is somewhat lavish. Bacause of the similarity of game mechanic, my game group played PI with the Digit Baseball vocabularies, for example, 2-ball-1-strike or 1-ball-2-strike and so on. Compared to another classic deduction game Clue, PI is worse. I was very disappointed. Where did the author put his brilliant talent and ingenious ideas? Finally, I sold the game away.

Deduction game with unclear/badly written rulebook. Cluedo for adults, without the writing aids for easy deduction, and a noir theme pasted on. A hardcore cluedo fan might like this. Had a friend walkout on the game.

P.I. is great as an entry-level deduction game and is a fantastic Clue replacement. It does have some randomness that can give certain players an advantage and tends to run long for a full, three-case game, but the actual act of trying investigate and deduce information is enjoyable.

Whoa, themed multi-player Mastermind! :) Not really my sort of game, I guess, but good fun all the same. I flunked my first case (-2 penalty for incorrect guess - I had a 50/50 chance), but got the full 7 points in each of the following cases.

RATING: 6.5
'Cluedo on steroids' indeed (or Clue if you're American), but given that I actually quite like Cluedo and this does away with the major frustration of spending 5 turns crawling across the board from the dining room to the library only to be called back to the dining room as a suspect, that's a recommendation.

The components look good and nicely evoke a 1940's American film noir (or source book from the 1930s), which is fine - I wanted watch The Maltese Falcon (again) after playing this (but then again, that's generally a good thing to do).

However, the colourful and busy graphics and stylised typefaces make the locations and tiles difficult to decipher, especially when viewed upside down (which was my view of the game). This slows down gameplay if you want to avoid mistakes, as indeed you should as giving someone mistaken information will wreck their game. There are rules covering the management of mistakes, but the graphical design does little to avoid such mistakes occurring.

Besides [thing=853][/thing], this is probably the simplest, most straightforward rule set I've ever seen out of Martin Wallace. At the beginning of the game, every player is dealt a suspect, a crime, and a location. This is the combo that the player to their left is trying to deduce. The board consists of spaces, each connected to 3 to 6 other spaces. A suspect, location, and crime tile is randomly distributed to each area face up. There is also a deck of cards that relate to every crime, suspect and location and 9 of those cards are turned face up. On their turn a player can send one of their five investigators to an area, pick one of the nine cards to question, or solve their case. If an investigator is picked, the player holding the case to be figured out tells the player to place cubes or disks or nothing in that area. A disk means that one of the tiles in that area match a card in their hand. A cube means that a tile in an adjacent area matches a card in their hand. If a player picks are card to question, the same response is given, but JUST for the suspect, location, or crime in question. Then it is the next person's turn.

Based on the disks or cubes on the board, the players can narrow down the card set they are trying to figure out until they are ready to guess. This creates a cool little puzzle to solve and it is a simple and neat way of creating clues. However, if a clue giver makes a mistake, that person scores zero and the victim automatically scores the maximum 7. This would be fine, except that the board is so jumbled with imagery, it becomes are too easy to make a mistake, both for the clue-giver and the deducer. Fine for the deducer, but a mistake will pretty much knock the clue-giver out of the game, and I have yet to play a game where there wasn't at least one clue-giver mistake. This is disappointing and could have been avoided. The game is reset and played 3 times, with scores (7,5,3,1,0 based on placement) for each round added together. Each wrong guess is a -2. The scoring is pedantic and unexciting, but I don't have a better suggestion. It feels to me that this game would be much better received with a better production.

Most remarkably, I got this explained by Martin Wallace himself at Spiel 2012. His introductory words can be read here repeatedly: "It's Mastermind meets Clue". We only played one case instead of the usual three but there's nothing new to see in further rounds which are just intended to balance the luck factor. Too light and random for my taste, no fun in the deduction.

Didn't really find this interesting or fun on any level. I was lucky and got a much easier mystery to solve than anyone else (all clues spatially near each other, and two even in the same area). After I was out of the game and everyone else still had half of it left, one player mis-answered one question once. And that totally ruined the remainder of the game.

+1 For making a deduction game where you don't have to take notes.
-1 For having to play the game three times to score properly and balanced out the luck factor.  It's much too long and tedious as...
-1 It's just not a real fun game even if mechanically it works as an interesting puzzle to solve
-1 You never get the sense that your moving around or that the board really has any meaning at all. It's nearly pointless to put out the randomized tiles.
-1 Very busy board art makes mistakes easier to make which ruin the game. Players complain it's hard to see and read the small tiles on the board and even the font is difficult for many players.  This is made worse as obviously many players have to sit to the sides or upside down yet still make no mistakes.
-1 Game just seems a bit under developed like it's the start of something really great but fell quite short.

In the end it comes down to there just being too many other great deduction games out there.  I liked this one more than the others I've played it with but agree it's more mechanical than necessarily fun so away it goes...

RATING: 7
I love deduction games. Deduction games have to be the one game where randomized set-ups are the norm. Without them the games would play out the same, always. P.I. employs a great random set-up to each mini-game. The game also rewards smart good thinking minds, while still maintaining an acceptable amount of luck. The one gripe I have with this game is that it is very reliant on human players not making mistakes. The game can be broken if players aren't careful or focus enough when giving clues to their opponents' case. Trusting the human element to never make a mistake is a bold gambit, but one that does pay off. I wouldn't mind owning this one, and it will always be what I wish Clue actually was. Great job Martin Wallace. I tip my hat to you good sir.

I'm not a fan of deduction games, but P.I. is a decent one. Even though it has some typical deduction game problems (it's played over several rounds but doesn't develop as each round is identical, one player accidentally giving wrong information can screw up the round, etc) and even adds some of its own (overly colourful board & bits) it's still an ok game thanks to compact playing time and the fact that good memory (or taking notes) are not needed to do well.

RATING: 5.2
Clue without dice? I have always thought that dice in Clue are distracting. One point for P.I. Yet, in P.I., players attempt to solve different cases, not a common case. The player on your right has all the answers that you want to know. In this regard, I think Clue makes more thematic sense. One point for Clue. So, Clue or P.I.? If I have to choose one of them, I'd pick P.I. over Clue, but there are so many other games that are much more fun.

Played once, 2p.  Wow, Wallace does deduction.  Well, this is clearly influenced by Sleuth, et. al., but I liked this much much more.  Information is essentially automatically tracked on the board.  I don't think 2 is the right number for this game, as going first seemed to be a big advantage.  Production values are outstanding, and the motif is very prominent.

RATING: 7
This is what Clue should have been.  It's an excellent tactical deduction game by Martin Wallace.  Detectives can be used strategically or can be used to mitigate bad card luck (cards drawn to the display). 

There are some subtle tricks as follows:  (a) selecting a card from the display to avoid an opponent having that choice, (b) when an opponent solves an element (by a disc placement) that also helps everyone else and (c) cards in your hand, which are your opponent's case to solve, are also clues for you and thus automatically eliminated from being in your case.

I didn't even know this game existed before I received it from Santa. But it was an extremely positive discovery! I have many times wished that Clue could be played with 2 players, but I've never found or come up with a solution for that. However, P.I. is the answer to my prayers! It's like a modern Clue, where it's possible to be only 2 players.

Whoever did the graphic design for this gameboard should be shot!  The game itself has some good, interesting ideas, but due to the numerous, egregiously bad decisions by the graphic designer, I find the game needlessly difficult to play.  Almost every aspect of the board's visuals reflects some bad decision -- bad choice of fonts, ugly and garish background colours, strange mix of B&W and colour photos, etc. make for such a "busy" board that it's almost impossible to find what you're looking for.  Since this is a game where you spend most of your time staring at the board trying to find things, that's not good at all.

It's a pure deduction game. There's a crime, a criminal and a place, you ask questions, get answers that will allow your to fine tune your next questions and eventually you'll find the solution and solve your case. Each player has a case and it's a race to solve it first.

The deduction level is not too high, but not everything is evident, you have to think. On the other side, ther'e san important luck factor too: the first questions are mostly blind, and depending on the answers, you can get a big boost in your investigation.

The game also boasts some interaction, you can benefit (not a lot) from the investigation of other players, and since you know the solution to your left player's case and questions cabnnoty be repeated, you can hinder his progress by asking about his location, crime or criminal. Now, if he realizes this questions is not appropiate for your line of investigation, he might suspect you did it on purpose ;-)

Lastly, even if it's very risky bussines, you can try to solve the case even if you're not sure about something. This should only be used as a last resort, because the penalties for failing are quite high.

The game progresses very fast, the offturns are brief, and you use them to think about your next question. Best thing is that it only lasts 45-60 minutes. It's hard to say no to an invitation!

The quality of the game bits is nice, and the graphic design is themed on noir fiction. But even if it's not a big deal, the tiles are not very distinguisable. 

Still not the great deduction game I'm looking for, but it's my fav of this genre for now. But I guess that if it ends up being too luck dependant, I will soon get tired of it.

Finally I have found a great deduction game with great theme and all the simplicity of game play needed for new gamers and gamers alike. When I discovered PI was by Martin Wallace and heard this was a deduction game...my first thought was "if anyone could do it Martin Wallace will." Boy was I right! The rules are very simple and quick to learn, I was up and playing with my wife in 15 minutes; all including unboxing, card sleeves, set up and rule reading. 

What do I know about deduction games and how does this compare? This is definitely better than Clue. I also love a big game of Mystery of the Abby, but the Abby has so much information you need to uncover, games can take a long time. Most of our Abby games have been a blast, but the length of play makes this hard to get to the table. How about Mystery Express? You couldn't tempt me with a deduction game more than this one did, but still this one feels like Clue when you play it. It is gorgeous and dripping with great theme, but can't seem to get anyone thrilled to play it and even I think it is too similar to Clue. P.I. reminds me of Code 777, probably my previous favorite deduction game. But P.I. has theme...glorious theme...which makes this now, for me, a cut above Code 777. Both of these games both are so clever and there are these special moments where you have to stop and wrap your brain around all the facts that you know, only to discover you actually know the answer...that splendid Aha moment! Or you have those moments when you think you know, maybe accidentally deduce something that isn't correct...or maybe you have to make an early guess just to keep up with your opponents...only to discover you were wrong...so good!

I believe this is an essential game of deduction everyone will want to have in their home. It should be perfect for families and fans of Clue...no doubt! It is fun, quick to learn, relearn, teach and play. It has excellent components and beautiful artwork. Love it...absolutely love it!

Really is a cross between Cluedo and Mastermind, where each player plays a detective trying to solve their own crime (held by the player on their right) before the other players solve their crimes. Turns are quick - pick a card (be it person, motive or location) and ask if that's it, or if its matching tile is adjacent to the crime's tile on the board. This process gradually eliminates contenders until you can work out what the crime actually is without having to fluke into the exact card(s) you need. Eventually you'll make an accusation and score positively if you get it right, negative for wrong, keep going until you get it right, first one outs scores the most. It has the fun of Cluedo but strips away all the dull luck of moving, and has the elimination aspects of Mastermind but adds a slice of luck in which cards you can use in any given turn. Both things are good. It's a nice filler at 15 mins, or you can play the full game of 3 rounds and add points across the rounds to determine the winner. There's still a fair bit of luck in what you pick and whether it matches, so don't come in thinking superior intellect is going to win. It's a family game, and works well at that given there's no dice!

RATING: 4.5
Based on one play: What a huge disappointment, you are better off playing clue as there is more interaction. You are each trying to solve a different crime, which is help by the player on your right, so when other players are investigating, it does not provide you any information. You play tokens to investigate tile sets or select cards to investigate specific regions and the player to your right indicates if you are in the correct area or close by based on the map and tile layout. It is deduction at its simplest and quite dull. I expected much more from Wallace.

I found this deduction game to be closer to Clue than to things like Mystery of the Abbey or Code 777--the information that you get during the game is actually manageable.  There is definitely way more information here than in Clue, but I was still able to compartmentalize it, instead of wondering how a given bit of info is at all relevant to my goals.  The game last 3 rounds, but you have a limited number of "big" investigations that you can use throughout the entire game, and an unlimited amount of lesser investigations, but there you're limited to cards that happen to be showing.  You're given info by electing a certain person, place, or crime that's laid out on the game board, and told whether you're correct, the correct answer is adjacent to you, or the correct answer is not adjacent to you.  In that way, you're able to whittle away the possibilities in a logical manner.  On the whole, this is probably my favorite deduction game--but the bar is not set incredibly high.

RATING: 6
Update: An example of how first impressions count as the visual design is disorienting, the tiles and cards should have different colour borders to help quickly locate crime, suspect and hideout; it is hard enough with being burdened with the inference from the placed cubes and how many. So the workload is unnecessarily made harder and as luck of investigator placement seems unfair much like real life crime solving ;-). However it is an engaging logic puzzle so undecided yet.

Dummy 2 player, one mini game: impression with 2 is there may be an issue with too many evidence cards of only 1 or 2 types on display (crime, location or suspect) so there may be a situation of being forced to use a PI token, a situation made more unpleasant if it is a coin toss as to where to place the token, but at least it provides tension. So at least with 3 players there will be more discs and cubes to inform, so maybe more interesting and the issue with evidence cards may diminish with quicker turnover.

I've heard PI being a hybrid of Clue(do) and Mastermind but because of deduction being more spatial I get the feeling it is more like 'getting warm, no hotter, oh dear now colder' game and this makes more thematic sense when trying to locate the suspects hideout. However there is a disconnect with cubes being placed regarding the crime and the suspect. Also worried there may be king making opportunity via misleading, but that is more to do with the players.

A szabály egyszerű, mégis egy kicsit zavaros volt, de lehet a szabály felületes.
Szóval Wallace egy kevésbé sikeres játéka, de egyáltalán nem rossz.
No szabályátrágás után, marha jó volt. 4 -n játszottuk, és bár nem mindenkinek tetszett, jó szórakozás volt a többségnek. Szerintem azért túlzásba nem kell esni vele, mert fakulhat a játékélmény és egyhangú is lesz. De hála az égnek van más alternatíva, még Wallace játékokba is . :D

Honestly, Clue is better. In Clue, it's way more interactive (players have to pay attention to all questions ask) and the puzzle Clue presents is more challenging. 

P.I. has a very confusing board. In this game, you make deductions whether a crime scene/crime/suspect is adjacent to a particular space. The locations of these very needlessly from game to game. It's simply very irritating trying to find these crime scenes/crimes/suspects on the busy board.

Winning strategy: Ensure that the crime scene/crime/suspect you have to deduce are located very close to each other. Of course, this is randomly determined.

Jogo interessante mas algo enfadonho, no qual a AP se torna quase que obrigatória, até porque o jogador tem interesse em analisar toda a evolução da mesa e normalmente apenas pensa na sua jogada quando já é a sua própria vez. Os componentes não são maus, mas a produção é fraquinha e a arte acompanha-a em níveis que já não se aceitam neste milénio. A jogabilidade é clara e é um jogo exigente, com uma pitada de sorte mas nada de escandaloso, onde reina o palpite e a dedução do primeiro ao último minuto...

RATING: 6
Played 2-player at Essen. It's enjoyably clever as a simultaneous [gameid=2392] sort of game (disks and cubes as clues function analogously to black pegs and white pegs in Mastermind). Nice "hard boiled detective" style illustrations.

But:

* Seemingly very little interaction (other than indirect interaction of me maybe taking the card you want).

* Unhelpful graphic design. (Suspects, locations, crimes all printed with same color/font makes the cards annoyingly similar looking. The board is rather chaotic/garish/confusing looking.)

* Perhaps inevitably in a hidden info / mystery solving game, there can be a lot of luck in the guessing.

Because of it being simultaneous independent puzzle solving, we would hesitate to play it with many players and have to wait that much longer to get back to your turn.

May not be Wallaces most original game, but the Cluedo/Mastermind mix works for me.

Not so bad, but really abstract and in a way weird. I felt like Columbo: "May I ask one more question?" But the answer was pretty random and by the way: you can be a lucky private investigator or not. What's great: The artwork is soooo 20's American style! Love it!
All in all it's not convincing me. Three more or less repeating mini rounds without much suspension.
You can compare this game to the classic "Minesweeper" game.

Not my idea of fun. 

Better than Clue, in some ways, but the fact that each player tracks down another isn't so compelling. Still a lot of luck, too, so I'm not sure what the point is. As others have mentioned, the board is busy and rather ugly, but maybe that adds to the fog of war.  

The theme, although fitting, does nothing for me--not my era--cardboard 40s-50s noir. Comes off as a rather cheap production, but it's a solid game if you find raw deduction with a little card manipulation enjoyable.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I enjoy exercising the logical thinking you need to prevail at this and it was nice flavor.  The board could have been better designed: it's very busy.  It's not the kind of game you can play often but it's decent fun on occasion.  Better than Clue and more interactive than MasterMind since everyone is trying to work out their own case while giving clues to others.  As in Clue, sometimes other people's information helps you get ahead too.

RATING: 7
Clever deduction game in which the players start right over asking questions to solve their cases, guided by cards that allows them to get information of one of the elements of the mistery, or agents, that run out as they are used and let you find out about all the elements present in a location. Each player has to solve a different case in all three rounds of the game. It feels in a way like a cleaner Clue, without all the stupid dice rolling and wandering around, allowing the players to concentrate only in their thougts. The penalty for giving wrong information is devastating, not only for the player that did it, which can turn in kingmaker situations. I believe it works better with three people, so nobody has an advantage cause everybody would be the starting player in a round.

Solid, enjoyable family game.  It is much more interesting that Clue or similar deduction games.  The rules are easy enough for anyone to learn quickly but there is enough thought for a gamer to enjoy a light deduction game.   The art is great for the theme.   I play with my 9 year old daughter and love to watch her reason out the options.  "If a cube is here, it can't be Frenchy, Knuckles, or Bubbles."  And with another cube here, it can't be Maurice.  It has to be X.  That is the only logical thing."

I like deduction games. While this game is a bit more pure logic that I might prefer I still find it fun. The biggest plus to these kind of deduction games is that even if I do not win I feel like I accomplished something by solving my mystery. The biggest downside to this game is that through random luck, one player can have a much easier mystery to solve than other players because more than one of their elements happens to be at the same place.

We played one round. Simple deduction game. I wrote my diploma thesis on those, so I guess I should be more thrilled about it than I actually was. But I'm willing to call it an okay game, compared to certain other criminal deduction games that I have played recently.

There's not much there in terms of strategy, though. If you are unlucky with your location, or are found out quickly, that's basically it for you. Let's put it like this: It's fun to deduct where someone else is, but who wins the game has not much correlation with skill. (Unless someone is really stupid. I guess they'd indeed lose.)

A játékosok egy-egy bűntényt próbálnak kitalálni, azon belül is egy helyszínt, egy elkövetőt és magát a bűntett mivoltát. Akcióként választhatnak a véletlenszerű lapokból, amik a lehetséges helyszíneket, elkövetőket és bűntetteket jelzik, amivel kvázi rákérdeznek az adott dologra, az utánuk levő játékos pedig jelzi, hogy beletrafáltak-e vagy a szomszédos mezők, esetleg azok sem tartalmazzák a kitalálandót. A táblán hármasok találhatók, ahol a helyszínek fixen helyezkednek el és hozzájuk véletlenül sorsolunk mindig egy-egy elkövetőt és bűntettet. Lehetséges még egy-egy hármasra rákérdezni, ezzel mindhárom dologra egyszerre rákérdezni. Aki leghamarabb kitalálja mindhárom célját, az 7 pontot, a következők kevesebbet kapnak, ha nem abban a körben találják ki ők is. Ilyen fordulókból játszunk 3-at a végső győztes kihirdetéséig. A játék alapvetően nem lenne rossz, de én kicsit egysíkúnak éreztem és nem tudom elképzelni, hogy ez hosszútávon is szórakoztató. Ugyanúgy játszanám a következő partit is vele, nem érzek benne fejlődési lehetőséget. A Myterium nekem ennél jóval szórakoztatóbb.

A light deduction game played in 3 rounds, each the same as the last; best sum of scores after 3 rounds wins. The bits of information are on display on the board, but it still helps many people if they keep notes.

The game works, and would probably be great for families or casual gamers. But (1) I prefer more difficult deduction games, and (2) there's more luck in the game (if you happen to choose the right question early in the round, you can eliminate a LOT of possibilities quickly) than I prefer.

--- Summary ---
3 rounds. For each:
Setup
1. Take all their wood pieces except those on the score tracks. 
2. Pass your cubes and discs to the RIGHT
3. Give each player one each: location, guilty party, and crime card
4. Set up board: 1 suspect and 1 crime per location. Remove any "no crime" and "no suspect" tiles from board.
5. place 9 random evidence cards in display

Play
On your turn, do one:
- place investigator in location on board. Player to right places cubes if any of their cards indicate adjacent locations; or discs if same space as investigator location
- select evidence card from display; player to right places cube/disc if their card indicates adjacent location or location indicated by card
- attempt to solve your case: use black discs to indicate guess; if any wrong, advance on bonus track (lose VP)

All 3 rounds same; most total VP after 3 rounds wins.

Refreshing deduction game.
Sure there's is some luck tied to the game (all deduction games suffer from that) and playing 3 rounds is a little too much, but just play one round enjoy it for what it is and be done with it.  In the same vein, the scoring system doesn't make a lot of sense ; the game often ends with a tie.

RATING: 4
Pure deduction game where players attempt to find out three pieces of information: whodunnit, wheretheydunnit and whattheydun. As a multiplayer game it's really a two-player daisychain where each player attempts to deduce the cards held by the person to their right. If it isn't strictly multiplayer solitaire, it's because seeing other players' clues on the board necessarily limits your own options.

It's got a good theme, nice art, and far, far too much luck. A lucky detective will beat a good detective every time. A much more minor complaint is that the design of the board and components makes identification, let alone deduction, harder than it needs to be, but that's just insult on injury.

The market for deduction games is pretty crowded and the only reason to play PI is that relatively few of the good ones take more than two players.

It's a mildly interesting evolution of Cluedo. It feels like the designer didn't like the dice rolling, or losing because another player gave away too much information and so set out to fix those two perceived issues. They have, but the resulting game is still heavily dependant on luck with card draws, the locations of the tiles and lucky initial placements of the PI tokens. 

Played over 3 rounds, to presumably try and reduce the luck factor, this now overstays its welcome by half. After a round and a half, we'd seen everything PI had to offer. It's pretty, but it's vacant.

Found it for £7 online which I couldn't pass up.

Update: 

An okay light deduction game with some confusing design choices.

The location postcards pinned to a cork board with photos for suspects and crimes (and the locations again - huh?), is a nice idea, but makes finding anything on the board tricky.

If the counters had been photos with a more legible font for the names, and a white backgrounds instead of the cork background, it would have made more thematic sense and been clearer.

And the investigator counters look alike in so so light. I managed to confuse my yellow with my opponent's green counters.

These issues don't break P.I., but do lose it points.

Deduction game without notes, all the notes you need are on the board.  The player to your right knows your solution and gives you information as you investigate.  Randomness of the card deal enables players to have much easier solutions than other players, but it balances by having the play the game 3 times to finish it (and it's not fun enough to play 3 times).  Lots of downtime between turns.

The luck of the draw imbalance makes the game very much not fun.  The deduction starts by arbitrarily choosing spaces on the board and hoping you chose something near your solution, then narrowing it down over several turns.  Game turns out to be pretty bland.

One of very few deduction games that can work for 2 players.

RATING: 3
An [i]extremely[/i] light (think zero calories) deduction game.

Players who select cards that serendipitously match their target cards have a big advantage over their opponents, based on nothing more than sheer luck.  Also, when there's a shortage of one type of card, one or more players can ensure that other players never see that card type.  That doesn't seem right.

The game consists of three identical rounds, so there's no build-up, no evolution, and no carryover.  Just three separate mini-games crammed into one.  After the first round, I was ready for it to end.

Finally, the graphic designer must be a member of the All Hallows Eve Society based on the radioactive tile design: illegible black lettering on a pumpkin orange background.  I usually don't care about component or board art, but [i]P.I.[/i] is the first game to give me a perception headache - now in its sixth consecutive week.

A big disappointment.

RATING: 6
Claims to be a cross between Cluedo and Mastermind and I think that's pretty accurate. It's a relatively light deduction game in which each player is trying to solve a different case whose solution is known only to their neighbour. The case comprises three elements: culprit, crime and location, so each player draws one card of each type at the start of the game. These cards show the solution your right-hand neighbour is trying to find.

The board shows a city made up of connected locations and in each location there can be a suspect and/or a crime, or possibly neither. The suspects and crimes are randomly distributed across the board each game, so their locations are not fixed. There's also a deck of cards representing each element in the game - one card each for suspects, crimes and locations. Each turn you can do one of three things: take a card, place a detective or make a guess. 

Taking a card lets you choose from a face up selection of nine cards and then your left-hand neighbour tells you how much information you have gained from it (if any). This comes in the form of cubes or discs placed on the board. Let's say I picked Rusty. If Rusty committed the crime, my neighbour would place a disc on Rusty wherever he is on the board. If he wasn't involved but is situated adjacent to the true culprit, my neighbour would place a cube on Rusty instead. If the culprit is not adjacent to Rusty, no cubes or discs are placed and I get to keep the card as a reminder of my failure. (Actually, some information can be gained from this as I'm narrowing down the areas of the board where the real culprit must be located.) The card is then replaced by a new one to keep the choice at nine cards.

You have a limited supply of detectives and once they run out, you don't get them back. Placing a detective lets you pick any location on the board. Your left-hand neighbour then places a disc for each element of the crime that is in that location, or a cube for each element adjacent to that location. So you don't get to know which part of the crime was committed there, or nearby, but you can get a lot of general information that way, helping you to narrow down your enquiries.

You can take a turn to guess the answer whenever you like, but for each incorrect guess you move your marker down on the Bonus Point track, so you'll score fewer points at the end of the game. The first player to solve their crime correctly scores the most points, subsequent solutions are worth fewer points, although you can score the same points if you solve your crime on the same turn as someone else, just so it's fair. The full game involves solving three crimes, so you basically play the game three times, although your supply of detectives has to last you the whole three.

I've played one two-player game of the prototype version of P.I. which was enjoyable. We embellished the investigations with a few hardboiled, gumshoe clichés to liven things up, as the prototype was quite basic in terms of art and design. "Stop picking on Queenie. She had nothing to do with it! Don't you know she's a reformed character?" We had a small issue with the scoring for two players. It seemed that it was quite likely to end in a draw with the rules as written. I've no idea if this has been fixed in the final version. 

Deduction games go down well in our house and the theme of this one adds to the fun.

I think that most of deduction games don't work well as a game.
But, this is a rare exception from this theory.

Sam's #4 of 2016. Racing component to Carcassonne
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Played at Essen 2016.

One of the better Carcassonne variants. Small rivers equal streets, villages equal cities. You only have two huts to put into the jungle to score animals in the area. 

Whats special about this is the big river. Whenever you do not place one of your pieces you move your boat further down. Whenever you place a meeple on small river tile with a boat symbol on it or add a boat symbol to one of your small rivers, you move your boat. Whenever you draw a big river tile, the boats are scored with points going only to the first and second place. 

It was simple, it was fun, it was Carcassonne! Only downside, you need a rather long table. The layout will always be more a line shape than the classic square shape due to the river.

Another reinterpretation of the classic, borrowing elements from hunters and gatherer and introducing canoes as another opportunity to score in compensation of not placing a meeple. Only one inconvenience: you need a table almost as large as the Amazon(1 m long) :)

RATING: 7.2
I prefer this over standard Carcassonne but South Seas is my favourite implementation so far. Drawing a river title is a negative for me here as it adds ZERO choices and compounds a player's good/bad fortunes with no way to mitigate the luck of the draw.

Components: Looks great. Right up there with Hunters and Gatherers and The Castle as my favorite-looking Carcassonne games. This game in particular is filled with life: villages, animals, trees. The end-game arrange isn't as nice, though; the river restriction causes a long axis, sometimes with perpendicular axis, rather than the more tightly clustered final map of other Carcassonnes.

Experience: The drawing and placing of Amazon tiles feels a bit randomly constraining. As in all Carc games, tile draw in general is random. Feels a bit clunky to always be remembering to move the boats when I don't place a meeple. The river takes away from my pure enjoyment of claiming villages, tributaries, and jungles. Jungle scoring, like in Hunters and Gatherers, is easy and fun. Because of the mini-game going on on the river, this game more than other Carcs is analysis prone; 30 minute playing time seems inaccurate.

Another very nice variation of Carcassonne. The Amazon river tiles stretch the game space and make it feel like a race to explore the Amazon region. There are some nice new decisions to make (not placing a meeple will move your boat). My wife and I enjoy it with just two, and we look forward to trying it out with more players.

Fantastic new implementation of Carcassonne.  I like that building huts is just like doing farmers but at the same time, much more obvious and limited by only 2.  Also, once you've played a few times you realize how important it is to keep your boat moving (especially in a 2 player game) in order to prevent a runaway leader.

RATING: 7
A decent version of Carcassonne - it definitely looks beautiful. But overall, I find the racing mechanic tends to make the game less interesting rather than more interesting, and with the rest of the scoring amounting to just counting symbols, it's just too simple, in my opinion. I'd rather play standard carcassonne.

RATING: 7
The race on the Amazon River introduces a new dynamic to the series, but otherwise there are just small variations on well-known scoring methods. Cities become villages and roads become rivers, although the boat icons make these more attractive for helping in the race. Camps in the jungle replace farms and are like simpler meadows from "Hunters & Gatherers", scoring animals but without tigers to reduce their number. Not essential by any means, but certainly a good addition for the collection of "Carcassonne" fans, so far the best from the "Around the World" set.

Requires table space, as during the game the Amazon River will be built in a straight line and room will be needed for that. I like how the race element is implemented (moving your boat down the river) with tile laying. If you draw a tile you don't like, you can just move your boat instead of putting a meeple on the new tile. When the river scores points, if you are behind, you get an extra bump on the river to catch up. Nice stuff.

I don't own a lot of Carcassonne games so I don't know if it's the best one out there. I like the additions to the base game, adding the race on the Amazone river gives it a nice twist and keeps it challenging. Other than that it's still good old Carcassonne and there's nothing bad about that, great game.

Variación de Carcassonne. Típico juego de colocación de losetas. Este con temática selvática. Al igual que el juego original, aquí uno construye un paisaje como si completara un rompecabezas. El jugador reclama sectores del mapa con sus trabajadores (meeples) para adquirir puntos de victoria. Esta variante añade un factor de carrera; mientras se va formando el río, uno podría hacer avanzar un barquito esquivando cocodrilos (si es que hay cocodrilos en el Amazonas...) y pirañas. Simpático y divertido!

This is like the original with racing mechanic added. When you don't place a meeple or you place on a canoe space you go forward on the river. If someone draws a river tile then a little scoring occurs and if you are too far behind you close the gap a bit. Got rid of it since it felt convoluted and I liked the original better. But I won't plan on getting the original also since I like Cacao much better.

RATING: 7
Might be my least favorite of the Carcassonne Around the World series even though I do like the racing aspect.
My two main concerns:
- the rest of the game feels almost... uninspired in the way those parts don't really offer any variation on what could be seen before (farm scoring done in the way most spin-offs do since Hunters & Gatherers; roads and cities work the same way as the original with almost perfectly the same rating).
- I like the tension provided by the constant threat of the race, but - especially in a multiplayer game - if a player keeps drawing the Amazonas tiles they can't really achieve enough in other fields, or you can be blocked in finishing your features started or can't join an important farm because of drawing the Amazonas tiles instead.

Also, the huts. I'm not sure what to think after 2 plays. Huts worked perfectly in Over Hill and Dale to remind new players it is worth using two of your meeple for some kind of farm scoring. Now that it's used here for farm scoring as well feels more limiting. Of course I can see the intent - farm scoring has always been the hardest to grasp part of Carc for newcomers and it does kind of force them to use two meeple for this. But here, unlike in Over hill and Dale, farms can be joined and majority can be gained over them. If someone joins their second hut to the large farm and you can't use a third piece to get at least tied there (because, say, you used one of your huts elsewhere), you're doomed. It's okay that you can use your huts for farm scoring but I'd - at least - say you can use your meeple for farm scoring as well, provided your huts are already placed.


On the other hand, it's an exciting game with nice visuals and interesting considerations, only right now it feels more luck-dependent than usual.

Surprisingly fresh take on the classic tile laying game. Note that the manual is not telling a lie when it says to leave at least 1 meter of space for the board!
It's a bit disappointing though that the boat movement on the river rarely seems to come into its own. Unless you really focus on rivers with boats, you don't get too many opportunities to get away from the pack. This is further complicated by the free move for players in last place.

Simple but fun.  However, in a two player game at least, the Amazona tiles can become very frustrating when a player picks up one of those a few times in a row.  House-ruled to remove five of those tiles, the game is vastly improved.

Really fun version of Carcassonne. I actually enjoyed this more than the original, though I found myself really missing the Cloisters. That aside, this version of Carcassonne emphasizes moving your boat down the Amazon River, and I like how not placing your meeples helps you to do that. It gives those who aren't as experienced on when to place and take their meeples an adequate catch-up mechanic. I'm a tad worried that there might be a rich get richer problem here with the huts and the river traveling, but that could just be my inexperience talking. My favorite version of Carcassonne I've played so far.

Another fantastic Carcassonne game!  And one of the best looking ones too!  This version introduces a "racing" mechanic into the game, where you're racing your boats down the Amazon.  The race is always kept very tight and balances very well with the rest of the game play.  One way to move down the river is to not place a meeple or a hut.  And you only  get 4 meeples to place.  So this version really makes you think twice before putting out a meeple.  Excellent!

:thumbsup: Compared to Carcassonne, you feel like you have something to do each turn, even if it’s just moving the canoo on a turn where you didn’t place a meeple on your tile.
:thumbsup: The race on the Amazon river is a fun, yet not game-breaking way of scoring points.
:thumbsup: Tile placement rules (you can only place tiles alongside the Amazon river) make the board shape up in a very different way than Carcassonne and its other variants.

:thumbsdown: While they are beautiful, it’s easy to overlook some of the symbols on the tiles. This might even be more of a problem to colorblind players.

[HiG 16 Edition]  {Amazona; tile-laying; optimal 4p} This is an interesting twist to Carcassonne.  This adds boat movement to the game.  Jungle is the same as city scoring.  Tributary is the same as road scoring.  The camp is the farmer.  We don’t have monk in this game.

The additional of boat movement adds another layer of decision because whoever moves along the river scores many points.  So there is a strong competition at the river.

This may be the best multiplayer Carcassonne.  The tile distribution looks good.  The luck of draw is less strong.  This game is tense too because you can only have 4 meeples at your disposal, similar to others in the around the world series.

The tile illustration is colorful.  Perhaps it’s the most busy illustration of all carcassonnne games. The double tile is refreshing.  This makes this game special.  I wish they provide 50/100 score tiles, but we can make one easily ourselves.

+++ Amazon river with boat movement.

insted of cloisters we have the Amazon River

Overall not so interesting like the original carcassonne (even the base game) - not so many decisions (for example you have almost no shoice when you place a Amazon River Tile). Very colourful, maybe a little bit too colourful (fruits and animals could be similar).

The Amazon River crosses the whole board. Because of the focus on the river you almost have no time for a battle for a facitility with another player.

Great implementation of the original. The race in the main river is a brilliant addition to the game. The huts also makes the game "simpler" to teach and score. Go and get your copy!

nice but not outstanding, a bit "complicated" (relatively) at the beginning but then it is the usual carcassonne level of difficulty. It surely is different enough from other versions but not so much better than others. South Seas is probably better.

Wow this game is a lot of fun. The Amazon river is long so have a good size table to use. The racing down the Amazon is a great feature. If you like Carcassonne buy this game.

Excellent stand alone rendition of Carcassonne. Little different twist but we enjoy it.

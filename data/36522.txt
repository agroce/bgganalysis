This is a fantastic first published effort from Dani. This game brings everything I love about CDGs in a timeframe that is my wildest dream... 30 mins or less! Once you know the game I really think you could play 3 games in an hour.

If more games of this depth and length were published, I would definitely buy them. I think 2 de Mayo has done for CDGs what Pandemic did for co-operative games. It's fun, fast, and addicting... you will want to play again immediately!

The most intense game I've played. It is so quick, you can play it again to try a different strategy.

This game usually goes down to the wire, you just have to tough it out.

Fast, simple, low cost, steeped in theme, incredible challenge. Extremely good value game.

WarEuro Napoleonic. 
Madrid 1808 uprising, the spark that ignates the "Spanish Ulcer"
Simultaneous movement system similar to Qubec (Columbia Games).
The cat (french imperial troops) try to catch the mouse (spanish paisanos)in the streets and avenues of Madrid at beginning of the XIX Century.
Excelent filler. Can be played in less than 30-50 minutes. The replayability it's assured by the event cards.
The componentes are gorgeous and very thematic. A must in my collection.

This is one of the best Wueros and war-based fillers out there.  The bluffing and hidden orders reminds me a little bit of [thing=85][/thing].  The timing-racing mechanism is great.  Play is FAST.  The learning curve is small, and the challenge is great.  What's not to love?.  And the randomness of the cards prevent you from finding an unbeatable strategy for one side or the other.

[b]After 5 plays:[/b]
A small, asymmetrical (cvasi) wargame. The hidden orders and the fact that it plays in 30 minutes are nice. The somewhat scripted beginning and the more powerful French cards are not so nice.
I expect to either love it or hate it after some more plays.

:cry: :) Doesn't seem like a fair fight; also it might be better if you know the cards. Didn't hate my play of this, but nothing about it made me excited to play it again (despite winning, which I'm pretty sure was an accident, as I had no idea about the strategy).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Some feel that its a cat-n-mouse game, but there is more to it than meets the eye. The Spanish player has a higher learning curve and tactically has a smaller option than then French. In some way, the Spanish player need to react to French play than the other way round.

The French player have to be quite calculative in every move and card play, making sure (if thats possible) to eliminate 1 cube every turn or isolate the city in 2 halves.

A very simple but interesting war-ish game. A must buy for every newbie to wargames, And a must have for every hardcore wargamer that has forgotten the basic rules of engagement.

An Excellent game

This could almost be an abstract game, with the larger force trying to eliminate the smaller, while limiting its losses.  In fact, 2 de Mayo is redolent of the events it is based on, thanks to event cards and some simple though clever simulation of the situation.  Those cards add variability as well as historical flavour.  The game play is tense and challenging.

surprised to see i'm the lowest rating so far, but it's still a rare game i guess.  love the look and size overall.  i think the deck is so thin in terms of card count and strength and the odds so stacked against the french that i'm not much for the game after a single play.  i'd give it another twirl, but i'd probably have to be asked.  woulda bought the thing based on the box and description alone for sure, though.  makes me wish there were a shorter, smaller version of hammer of the scots.

A lot of good decision making for a relatively compact and brief game. The rulebook was needlessly bloated. Basic statements could have been made bold among 6 paragraphs that belabored the core rule. It felt like someone who is accustomed to making huge games made this, not realizing that simplicity would be seen as a virtue.

On a seperate note, the theme is a hard sell for some folks, but they'd be cheating themselves for not trying the game based on dislike for the theme alone.

RATING: 7.5
First 2 plays were very uninspiring; however, during the third I began to see the ebb and flow of the Spanish and the French troops, as well as some fun strategic moves. I am excited to play more, there seems to be a lot going on for such a small and short game.

This game is solid, but I just didn't hear it calling me back for another play.  I appreciate the ingenuity of the simple, yet strategic gameplay, and I would definitely try it again, but I wasn't batty over it the first time.

very quick to play with nice components. Relies on outguessing your opponent on where to move. whilst this is a good little game, would think that it would not sustain above half a dozen plays before it became somewhat boring.

Amazing little game! It is filled with theme and there is an extensive description of all the real life events on which it is based.

RATING: 5
Fell very flat for me due to timing issues.  Timing of card resolution boils down to "the player who played the card first gets to use the card's action first".  So for competitive play, it just doesn't work;  you end up with situations where both players are holding out to see if the other will play a card.

Simplifying rules by omitting things doesn't work;  There's nothing simple about having to scan through BGG forums for answers to rule ambiguities.  And worse is finding out there ARE no answers.

Pre-empted by some 'serious' gamers saying what a great game this is, we were left a little cold and unimpressed. Its a game of cat and mouse, the French chasing down the Spanish, the spanish, trying to second guess the french and stay alive.

The cards need to be fully read and memorised before play starts otherwise the French have no idea that they can lose if the have suffered 3 casualties if a card is drawn.

After one play it seems to be a game of bluff and guess work. The final play was exactly that and with vistory based upon the flip of a coin, I was glad it was only a 30 minute experience.

Writing down of orders seems very Diplomacy and somehow out of synch with my prefered games of the 21st Century. All in, I'm a bit cold about this one but will try to play again.

I thought we would play this more. A quick 2 player game where you have to outguess your opponent. Perhaps if we were more familiar with the card?

It's also a little dry for us. If I'm going to go for a quick outguessing game, I'm grabbing Yomi.

Light Medium wargame with simultaneous Action Selection. This already makes it a very interesting game in my book. Add to that the asimetric cat and mouse facet and the fact that it plays in half an hour and you have a winner. Truly amazing design which stays interesting because the event cards add just enough randomness to the game to keep it from getting repetitive.

Juego de acciones simultáneas con una ambientación insuperable. Es para dos jugadores, y las partidas se juegan rápido (30-40 minutos).

Además conocí al diseñador en el IV encuentro nacional de juegos de mesa. Un tipo interesante.

I got this one because it won a major award for best 2 player game last year, and because the theme and length appealed to Ashar.  I liked the game, as it does a lot with a fairly restricted rule set, and it plays quick - it scratches the war game itch while really being a Euro.  Ashar never asked to play it, so out it went.  This is a game that feels like you could exhaust it with enough plays, as the cards and their order are all that keep the game tactically fresh.

After 1 play, this is a difficult game to grasp, mechanically, and I think we got some rules wrong (time to re-read the rulebook). But it's interesting: what I at first thought to be a combat game turns out to be more of a cat-and-mouse game, with the larger French forces haring after the Spanish, while the Spanish try to "out-think" the French and escape into an ever more limited set of areas. That the somewhat confusing rules allow this sort of emergent gameplay is really quite wonderful, but we're not yet familiar enough with the rules to really enjoy the game.

Hmm ... second play, I worry about the balance a bit. The French position may be a lot more interesting than the Spanish one. For the French, playing the Artillery on turn 1 seems like the way to go.
---
This was really clever I thought. Interesting tactical choices for both sides. It really hits the sweet spot thematically, it's simple and playable but still quite thematically evocative. The cards give a nice balance between luck and skill. It's a graphically very nice and effective package, both attractive and functional. And you can't beat it at only about 30 minutes to play.

My only real complaint is the price, given replayability probably isn't likely to be huge. But, even though in general I'm not a fan of lightweight wargames, this one was very appealing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
An odd little game of cat and mouse. Turns out the cat (France) kind of smacks the mouse around, but the game says "if the mouse actually survives a little bit longer than expected, we'll call that a win". Thematically, it's a little hard to get too excited as the Spanish - "woo, you slaughtered me slightly less than the French did historically!" There are asymmetric hidden info games I like more than this - Lord of the Rings The Confrontation, Confusion, Mr Jack, but this is still different enough that I still own it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Pretty neat, quick, two-player battle game.  The game is lopsided by design, as the Spanish player just tries to hold fort for 10 turns, while the French player tries eliminating the Spanish before time is up.  The order system is like Diplomacy, where each player secretly orders their units, except the special cards can disrupt the expected results sometimes.  Overall, a pretty decent little game.

Updated 2/11/10

I've played the game a few more times (I think I'm up to 6 now).  Although I like the game, no one that I have played it with seem to have enjoyed it.  I think it's time to own up to the fact that some of my enjoyment comes from owning a unique game from a relatively small-time publisher and first-time designer.  This has turned out to be more of a collection piece than a frequently-played game.  

I really appreciate the history behind the game, and reading the introduction to the rulebook really helps set the mood.  But the game is losing a little something for me with each play.  I can't decide whether it's the static starting positions and cards or the lack of enthusiasm from my opponents, but I'm starting to feel like I've "been there, done that" after only a few plays. 

That's not to say the game's not deep.  The strategies employed in each game have differed considerably, and with time I'm sure interesting actions and counter-actions could develop.  I'm just not sure I have the patience (nor will I have the opportunity) to invest in reaching that depth.

RATING: 7
Based on 2 plays - one as each side!

Despite its simplicity, the strategy in this game is tough to wrap your head around. This is much more of a brain burner than I expected - ideally, you want to be thinking a few turns ahead (which I'm not always good at), trying to guess where your opponent is going to go, trying to bluff through your plays if possible, and trying to figure out what cards your opponent is going to play and account for them (the latter you can only do after a couple plays when you're familiar with both decks).

The combination of tough turn to turn planning and having an edge based on deck familiarity is probably what will make or break this game for you. It's JUST enough for me, I think, that I wouldn't want to pull it out every night, but I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to folks looking for something to play again and again against the same opponent - it's that sort of game. It reminds me in no small way of LotR: The Confrontation, though I think I prefer LotR.

Still, there's a lot to explore here and I wouldn't mind digging deeper. For example, there might be some higher level strategy associated with purposely remaining low on cards in order to deny your opponent cards, but in our first games it just seemed like it's always better to have more cards in hand, to increase your options.

My biggest mark against this game is the components. In a great and terrible display of favoring flavor over functionality, the board and cards use an awful faux-script font that is quite hard on the eyes. The background of the spaces on the board makes it harder still to read. The cards feel stiff and cheap, and in a game that relies on writing things down it only comes with ONE sheet of paper for your orders. Whiteboards would be excellent, but I could see why they'd want to avoid that to keep costs down, but still, at least two sheets? Or just some blank paper? Anything! And a small reference card for each player reminding them of their side's specific rules would not go amiss. Instead, it includes what feels like superfluous reference cards for the already incredibly intuitive turn flow. Maybe I'll just print up my own reference sheets.

I am not a wargamer, but I own this, Twilight Struggle and Command & Colors: Ancients (yes, I know they aren’t full-scaled wargames). I am a eurogamer by heart, but I think I would enjoy the occasional wargame – at least that was what happened with this game.

What I liked about this game in particular was the asymmetric nature of the game! This made the game very unique. The French possess so many units and therefore have the upper hand regarding military strength, but on the other hand they are not that mobile and cannot move from an area containing a Spaniard etc. (though the French can get a good control of the game if they manage to capture area 14/15/16). Furthermore, the victory condition was very cool! The French need to focus on obtaining all three of them, while the Spaniards “just” need to prevent the French from achieving one of them. It’s not easy, though, as the Spaniards are almost constantly on the defensive!

The game plays very fast and is a good little mini-wargame, and I think it will shine with more knowledge of the action cards. These cards are a good idea and are pretty varied, and it’s a good rule that you cannot hold a bunch more than your opponent. My only problem with the cards was the “random discard” card of the French. In both of my games (I have only played the Spaniards, so I want to play the French soon!) I had two useless cards and two very good cards in my hands, so this card can really have a big impact on the outcome of the game (I did lose my second game because I didn’t have access to my starting card as that was randomly discarded). Oh, and one final thing about the cards. Personally, I would probably almost always choose to start with the artillery card as the French, so that your unit in zone 10 doesn’t risk getting killed which make the Spaniards closer to achieving victory (especially if they get the card which makes them win if they have killed 3 instead of 4 French units). The other card about moving 5 units is very strong, no doubt about it, and I don’t think the French will be able to win a lot of times if they don’t get it during the game. 

In general there is some randomness regarding what you draw, and some cards might be useless once you draw them. Still, for a very quick game like this it doesn’t bother me much!

Neat little asymmetrical 'wargame'. Quick 2p with simultaneous movement where the Spaniards are playing the mouse to the French cat. The victory conditions for the French are a very high hurdle: kill all Spaniards, hold all the gates, and don't lose more than 4 (or 3!) of your own guys. And the Spaniards can move all their dudes each of the 10 turns while the French can only move two groups. Tense, quick, and fun. Oh, and some neat card powers that, once you know them, I'm sure make the game a lot richer.

1. Design - solid map, beautiful cards, all in historical flavor.
2. Mechanics - only 4 pages of rules - simple, but not simplistic. All match together. No doubt, no clarifications needed.
3. Play - I called this game a "historical puzzle". Short, full-of-tension wargame. Wargame ? yes I have no doubt that is a wargame. Small and sometimes abstract, but still a wargame. I enjoy it very much. And I wish to ourself more wargames like this.

:indigo: :( :) Nicely done, conveys the wargame vibe with an amuse-bouche game length. I'm a little concerned that the right card combination coming out  can make the game almost unwinnable, especially for the French player. But the game is Love Letter length, and like that game, the cure for an unbalanced shuffle is to re-rack and play again. 2 players only, but given that, this is as good as microgames get.

This game seems like it should fall squarely in my wheel-house.  I adore asymmetrical games, and I am a fun for deduction, so why doesn't this game click for me?  I think the issue lies in the cards, and in the small rules exceptions which I just can't explain away in terms of the theme and mechanisms.  Perhaps the mix of cards and rules exception just make the thing feel a little too gamey in comparison to something like Pax Porfiriana.

Traded away and hoping somebody will give it the love it deserves.

A nice small game with strong history flavor, The game is about second guessing your opponent. No luck except card draw. Visually appealing (rating +1). Small box makes the game easily portable. Quick play (rating +1) Easy rules, although you have to know the cards in both decks (22 cards total) to play efficiently. I like the asymmetry of the game: French and Spanish play very differently.

RATING: 6
The initial impressions of this game are average to good. The game is easily explained, plays out very quickly, yet is interesting to keep you busy because of the assymetry in what both sides can and cannot do. In essence, it's a game of cat and mouse where the cat has been somewhat declawed and the mouse is high on steroids and speed. I've not yet seen the French win (and a cynical streak in me might accuse the Spanish author of this game with less than noble intentions) but I attribute this to bad play and not making full use of various features on the map due to inexperience. Subsequent plays confirmed this suspicion: the French must truly be as nasty as they can be, and show no mercy whatsoever towards those pesky Spaniards. I nearly won the last time I played this, but I got greedy and got the hammer-and-anvil tactic (or is that strategy) I was following all messed up. 

As far as accessible historical wargames go, this one is pretty good. Okay, it isn't Hannibal (or anything else, for that matter).  But given the rather bloody background of the game, I was a bit surprised to see my girlfriend liking this title. I'm very much inclined to give the game one point deduction because of pretty much abysmal physical appearance, though. The cards are not particularly good nor easily legible, the board is tiny and easily obscured by hordes of French forces, and there's but one leaflet for people to write their orders out on. Why bother including that if players must provide their own paper and pencils to begin with?

This is a fun and surprisingly short 2-player game. Despite its short duration, this game doesn't feel like a filler - it manages to capture the feeling of a full game quite well. It is an entertaining game of bluffing, guesswork, a little deduction, and much reverse psychology.

The cards need to be well known and prepared for for serious play. Otherwise, you spend 5 mins thinking and calculating ... and then BAM! you can't do that actually, because I have a card that says you can't.

RATING: 9
One of those small games made up of a bunch of small cubes, a little map, a few cards that gets a high rating because it works. 

A great little game as long as you know that trying to wipeout the French quickly will get you no where. If you like Scotland-yard, The Great Muesum Caper, Nuns on the Run, get this. I am no fan of war games, miniatures, etc, just too much time needed and too many rules. This is a short played game in ten moves with simple rules for each side. Anything this short, this simple, yet plays this well gets a high rating from me.

Ok, the sides are not even, each side moves via of a different set of rules, the Spanish are fast moving, slippery side, the French way out number them and slow moving. The Spanish can't break apart when they group, the French can, the Spanish can run for it, the French can't retreat from battle. The Spanish can't really win by defeating the French. Sounds like a mess. A very interesting game played in ten moves. More of a hide and guess where I am moving game, for both sides,  more so for the Spanish as this is their strong point since they can move as many groups as needed, the French just two. And then there are the cards that can throw a wrench into things. Some people complain about the cards, then go play chess, gee in every revolution, battle, war, uncontrollable crap happens either bad for both sides or good for just one side. I think the cards work well for this game.

This is an excellent two-player game. It's very asymmetrical, and playing each side has it's own powerful sense of dread as the turns roll on to the end of the game.

RATING: N/A
I don't think I can rate this yet.  I enjoy the mechanics and the interesting variation between French and Spanish strategy but you HAVE to study all the cards before your first play or have a rude awakening.  

There is one card in the Spanish deck which is useless on its own and simply says that it is played with another card.  The other half of the pair says that Spain can win when 3 French units are killed instead of 4.  

We didn't know this when we played.  France lost 3 units early on but looked poised to win thanks to the card that let him recruit in any space on the board - but then lost when these cards came out in round 9.  There is a mention in the rules that cards could change the # of units needed to win but not how or which cards.

Still, this is a tense and fun game that I might play again if I study the cards in advance.

Interesting little brain burner.  I keep losing as the Spanish, but I haven't tried the "consolidate forces ASAP" strategy yet.

A very cool idea for a game with fascinating historical basis.  In practice, less exciting to play than read.  The results of card plays can be very dramatic, producing swings of fortune greater than I wanted from the game.  I can imagine it would become deeper with more plays, but it feels less compelling than [thing=18833][/thing], which has a similar element of double-think and counter-play.

RATING: 8
Clever, simple fast wargame that can be taught quickly to even a non-wargamer. Has elements of Diplomacy (hidden simultaneous movement and simple combat rules) along with cards that make the game feel different each time.
At first the French player might think he has it easy, what with more troops than the Spanish, but the rules restricting movement (only 2 moves for the French to unlimited moves for the Spaniard) and the tough win conditions make for a tight contest.
Highly recommended for that quick fix.

RATING: 7
A very interesting game.  I really like the simple and elegant way that the movement and combat mechanics work.  This rating is based on 3 plays so far.  At this point, the one downside is that some of the cards are very situational, or don't seem to lend themselves to good strategies.  The cards definitely seem more clunky than the rest of the game.  It is possible that it may take further plays to find the effectiveness of some of the cards.  Looking forward to further plays.

Uses the written orders system from classic diplomacy to drive a cat and mouse game as the French chase Spanish resistance/rioters around Madrid. I found it interesting whilst I lost as the French. I made a few bad moves and was a bit slow of the mark. I suspect this game will have a good dozen replays in it, but in the end one would expect patterns to emerge.

RATING: N/A
The asymmetrical aspect of the game, the card-use and the written secret orders intrigued my. It seemed like a fantastic little game. However, unfortunately the development in each game will be roughly the same. There is not much room for difference in development, for different game flow, and the only variation will be in the little details. This, however, leaves not enough room for meaningful decisions for me, as most of the game feels scripted - at least the important moves.
And this is just not for me. No matter the size of the game, if the game plays YOU most of the time, it is nothing I want to play...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I want to say I like this game more than I do.  It has potential for tense and exciting moments, but they are fleeting.  The first two pages of the rulebook, detailing the scenario, provided much more entertainment than the game, but I think that's just a side effect of such a mechanically-simple design.

That is not to say 2 de Mayo isn't a good game.  In fact, for what it is, it is quite a solid effort and delivers a great amount of theme for a subject I'd never known about.  It makes sense that the overall appeal is cat-and-mouse because there's no realistic way the peasants would have won, but what's being measured here isn't a win/lose situation, but one of effectiveness.  A good Spanish player, for example, represents a spirit that historically echoes through the future to come.  I think a little more chrome would have been nice in the long run, but hey, the game does its job.

What I really enjoyed most was the simultaneous movement.  Few games make use of this, but I always enjoy seeing it.  Unlike worker placement, it doesn't feel old-hat to me... yet. ;)  It lends itself to a little bit of gambling and that always ups the ante when you're running for your life (or trying to snuff out an elusive opponent's).

My biggest worry is that repeated plays will see a "one solution", but I won't know until I get this on the table more.  Problem is... most people don't like it after they play it.  It's a bit polarizing that way.

Good light wargame filler. Fulfils the necessary criteria of theme, simplicity, game length and strategy/gameplay.

Good game which plays in a reasonable short time frame.  One problem however is that it is a bit chess like.  One or two false moves early can lose the game for the French.  Preferable would be that poor moves result in a good lead for the Spanish rather than an automatic loss for the French.  The rule that if one order is incorrectly written then all orders are invalidated is a complete loser and should be ignored as it wrecks the game.

RATING: 7.5
2 de Mayo is a short two-player wargame, pitting two asymmetrical armies against each other, and is based on the 1808 May 2nd Uprising in Madrid, against the occupying armies of the Napoleonic French.  The game's biggest strength is the difference in size and abilities of the two factions.  The French have an overall 3:1 unit advantage and can easily divide their force into smaller detachments to chase and surround various enemy units.  The Spanish, despite their eventual numerical inferiority, have the advantage of mobility, being able to move more of their pieces than the French, have generally superior cards to play, simpler victory conditions, and start off (for the the first two rounds) with a near equality of units with the French until the latter can bring the bulk of his forces to bear on Turn 3.

The game lasts only 10 turns, which amounts to no more than 30 minutes at most, and from experience, involves relatively little fighting; the game's primary focus is a cat-and-mouse maneuvering, as one side tries to avoid engaging the other until numbers favor them.  Another nice addition to the game, is that the French can pick one of two cards to start with, each favoring a fairly different style of play for that side, increasingly replayability and tactical depth.  

Interestingly, I've noticed the game seems to have a fairly strong Spanish bias, which seems pretty anti-thematic, though that may be inexperience on the part of my friends and I.  Nonetheless, it is still a very enjoyable game, and because of its short nature, a loss does not feel too crippling on the morale, so repeat games are common.  2 de Mayo is also dripping with theme, and the manual does a fantastic job of explaining the history of the event, though the game's Spanish origin shows, as it takes a few liberties with facts and numbers, but nonetheless should be commended for its attempt to inform and involve its player base.  A bit pricey for the amount of gameplay you get out of this one, but if the theme or asymmetrical warfare interests you at all, then it is worth a purchase.

RATING: 7
I have put small blue & read dots in the areas where the armies start, that way I don't have to refer to the rules--if the game is reprinted, I think they should do that.

I have played the Spanish twice and the French once--the Spanish always win hands down--and I can't figure out a strategy where the French have a chance.  Maybe the French haven't drawn the correct combination of cards--which doesn't appeal to me--don't want the play to rely that heavily on luck.

Never the less, the game is intriguing, fast, and visually appealing--the board, a good size for 2 players, but the cards and print ridiculously small.  Not only that, the beautiful script with its flourishes is difficult to read. Luckily there are only 11 cards each, so learning the cards will help.  Several misprints in the rules, and perhaps misprint on a card or two--confused & not sure.

This reminds me a little of Battle Line although I suspect most people would respond, "huh?  Your kidding.".

This game is a bit too tense for me, but its simplicity and short playtime are great.

Duration: Plays extremely quickly; the French can lose very quickly at lower levels of skill.
Design: Ingenious asymmetry and simplicity; however you play from the same start each time, and pretty much use the whole deck so there's less variety.
Strategy: It's all about cat-and-mouse and bluffing, which ended up being too tense for me. Spanish are easier at lower levels, but apparently have a tough time when both players are veterans.
Production: The production is quality, and the second edition made fantastic improvements to graphic design.
Theme: This is a micro-wargame, a historical re-enactment of a day in Spanish history. The design is fairly abstract but carries out the situation well.

RATING: 6
After playing 2 de Mayo you really know what the term "asymmetric player positions" means. The French and Spanish forces are so wildly mismatched that an unsuspecting look at the board after setup makes you think the game will be over before it has even begun.

Quite surprisingly, that is far from true. Especially the rigid movement restrictions for the French mean that the vastly outnumbered Spanish bands can keep up their game of cat and mouse for quite a long time. At least if they keep guessing correctly. The mismatched strengths and simultaneous action selection open the door to a lot of doubleguessing and bluffing, and your enjoyment will likely depend on how much you like or dislike this.

Likes: Simultanious movement and hidden orders.  The game is minimal in rules and componants but there is so much strategy and decisions thrown in. A little luck with the draw which is just the right amount.
I also love that this has such a short play time. 

Dislikes: Reminds me of Mr. Jack in that for new players playing the spanish, will find it rather difficult to win. Once both players are experienced it should balance out nicely. 

Overall. This is a good game. My enjoyment of the game did dimish a little with more plays.

A great light-medium board/wargame combo that teaches history very well. I thought it's very clever how the designer turned an imbalanced situation into a balanced gameplay, via different rules (e.g. French player can move 2 orders per turn, Spanish unlimited) and the use of cards. Pretty board is a plus.

Reminiscent of Fury of Dracula for its cat & mouse feel, this game is really simple, straightforward, and fast. The theme fits well and I can see it getting quite a few plays, but in the long run it may be limited by the short duration and small set of cards. Since you see all your cards every game and the starting position is always the same, it may get stale over time.

I don't know how the balance is in the game - it seems like it's easier for the Spanish to win, but I'll have to see after a few more times playing.

An interesting game of cat & mouse between unbalanced sides. Unfortunately, the winning strategy for the Spaniards is difficult to block by the French unless concentrated on from the beginning. Sadly, it takes the first complete game to realize this.

A few plays in, it is a pretty nice little game. The entirely mechanical combat is a good idea, it moves the emphasis of the game entirely onto the area movement; a game this length doesn't need more than one central mechanic. The asymmetry works, and usually there is a fair bit of tension right to the end. Good for two players who are waiting for people to turn up/another game to end. The cards are oddly massive in size.

Very fun but overpriced for what comes in the box.  (Note this microreview is for the Gen X edition, I haven't seen the griffon games edition)  Short, easy, and full of historical flavor the asymetric positions of the two sides brings to the table....  overall a very strong game.  Nothing else on my shelf packs this much history or strategic depth into 30 minutes.  A lot of the game is a secret-order guessing game which is fun but I am not sure about the replayability.

RATING: 7
It shares some mechanical similarities with Dynasties but the bluff/counterbluff feels less like "random chance", probably because of the more dynamic map. At least as much of a wargame as Twilight Struggle. Since it is (at least somewhat) a CDG it means the first play is likely to be frustrating as "surprises" pop up. (e.g. your opponent suddenly playing Murat when you didn't even know such a thing was a possibility.)

The rules are *almost* really smooth. A couple bits of wargamey chrome about the main boulevard complicate explaining the game and often get forgotten on initial plays. Some of the interactions between cards aren't very well explained but in practice amicable opponents should be able to come to an understanding.

Luckless combat is always nice and, overall, the asymmetry is pretty well done. The asymmetric win conditions are a bit unsatisfying at times. (All my people were killed but I "won" because you couldn't get a unit back to the gate by the 10th turn.)

I'm a bit uncertain about how replayable it would be against the same opponent given the fixed start positions (just like in Mr. Jack)

A beautiful blending of abstract game and thematic sim.  The rules are written with huge sympathy to the subject matter by real historical enthusiasts of the Spaniards uprising in Madrid.

I love history and inspiring and heart wrenching events like the one this game is based on. It's also one of the few war-ish games my partner will play with me (she's beat me every time plié thee side). It's nice and quick playing. A fun game of cat and mouse with a deck each of action/event cards to spice things up. I like that it's a 2 person game, as that's the majority of our gaming. Also the small size and the artwork are great. It checks all my boxes. Excellent game.

RATING: 8
A very nice fast but MEATY little war simulation game for 2 players that plays in about 20 - 30 minutes, it is also nicely themed (actually the game IS the theme, built right on it) and mechanics/rules actually relate to the theme somewhat. There really are not enough short MEATY games out there yet. 

Both sides in this game have completely different tasks and each one presents a tough challenge. The French are trying to keep control of Madrid and completely eliminate the Spanish troops before the rounds run out. The Spanish are running around just trying to survive taking pot shots where they can. 

Replay concerns me only slightly as some optimal strategies might become apparent and being a small system there won't be that many, however cards will give it some much needed variability as they come to you randomly and these do change the order of how certain things take place. Also, actions are chosen simultaneously so you will never actually know what your opponent is up to also helping to keep it fresh and providing a cool double guess element as well. 

The only luck in the game is the cards and the jury is out on how important this card draw will be to your fate once you learn some of the strategies. Lots of decisions to be made for such a short game and several cool little inclusions were included in the rules to make this interesting. Reminds me a little of King of Siam or a real boiled down Twilight Struggle even though it is largely different from those titles.

[u]UPDATE:[/u] Finally got a hold of this game and played another 3 games after my initial game in Essen 08. My rating sticks for now but boy does it look hard to win as the French, especially if the Spanish player is careful and combines forces. The French did win one of the games on turn 10 though (3rd one so he improved) so I remain hopefully that the French will improve with more experience but I do see some people all thinking along the same lines here. 

I do want to make a very special mention about how the rules were written. What an awesome job to incorporate so much of the story and background of the events of that day, its a real joy to read so great job Dan and thank you for all the hard work that went into that!  

A very enjoyable game, Cat and Mouse no doubt with a slight touch of chaos from the cards, just enough to slighty foil a plan or two and to always give your opponent enough doubt about what he should be doing. Its quite a little "thinker" as you need to be pretty careful in your plans and some situations do become precarious.  

Hoping the French find a way to even the score or just keep it close, will update and only tweak if necessary.

An interesting game of cat & mouse between unbalanced forces. A kind of Diplomacy (AH) for two players, without support and events. I think we got some rules and examples wrong (time to re-read the rulebook) and timing of card resolution is chaotic and or doesn't exist. The order in which cards are stolen is 90% of the game. Limited replayability. An expensive game for what it offers.

So far, so good - I am enjoying it. I still have precious little idea of how to play well, though. :-)

Interesting for being so asymmetrical, 2 de Mayo is a game where doublethink works as a strong element.

6 plays in. With no game knowledge it seems easier for the Spanish to win, but after working out a viable French strategy (use the Artillery card, avoid losses on the first couple of turns, then sweep the Spaniards into a corner) I think they have the edge. I now need to work a little more on what the Spanish can do....

I like the gameplay a lot. There are only 10 turns, the majority of the French army is locked outside the city for the first two turns (after which it will take time to bring them into play) while those on the inside dodge the Spaniards who can concentrate quickly, leaving eight turns to bring in the reinforcements and hunt the Spanish down.Time is not on the side of the French.

I saw someone else comment that it has the feel of a much longer hex and counter wargame condensed into 30-45 minutes, and I get that feeling too.

Wildly imbalanced forces but vastly different victory conditions. One player leads the rioting Spanish and tries to survive until Sundown. One player leads the French military and comes down hard, but must do it quickly and can't afford to lose key positions or suffer many casualties. Plays quick, with simultaneous movement selection, and the random order of each player deck will probably keep things fresh. 

Update: so far I'm really enjoying this with 8 plays, but I've yet to see the French win. I haven't quite figured out what approach to take with the French. If you're reckless the Spanish will clobber you for 3 or 4 casualties and it's over. If you're conservative and methodical in tightening the cordon, you may not be able to bring sufficient force to bear quickly enough. I think winning as the French may involve deliberately losing one (maybe two) units in order to halt the Spanish. We'll see. I won't upgrade the rating until I see a French victory. 

Finally! A French victory on my 10th play! Somehow it feels a bit unearned since it was against a new player. I really enjoy this game though, lingering balance concerns aside. 

Update: I enjoy this game because it's compact, different, niche, etc. Not good enough to play all the time but always a nice change of pace.

Played this with the designer in Essen. An innovative game from a small publisher which was hidden in the fantasy hall.
The secret order mechanism reminds of Diplomacy without the negotiation part. It should play in less than 30 minutes and can be explained in 5 minutes. Fills a unique niche which might be its chance and its drawback. I enjoyed it but I'm not sure who I would play this with. 30 minute light wargame fixes are just not what I'm regularly looking for.

The method of play makes it feel like you're a general writing down your orders to be despatched to your units throughout the city. I like that.

The game has paper stone scissors aspects to it and I would like to be able to play this game a little more to find out how much of the game is strategy and how much the outcome of a p-s-s contest

An interesting game that I admire for its dedication to historical detail, yet I'm not convinced that I will be able to get it to the table much, mainly due to lack of a consistent opponent.  I would like to try this a couple more times to firm up my opinion.

RATING: 5
Okayish little 2 player filler game. The main mechanic are the players writing down their troop movement orders. The Spanish need to survive for 10 turns, and the French need to wipe them out.

A bit too simple and small to have much replayability. I thought it was so-so, nothing brilliant about it.

A very peculiar strategy game that is also fast to play. The game is for 2 players only which means it doesn't come on the table that often, but I always like the game when it does. Aside for a "real" game it is more like a brain teaser or a puzzle and I like those.

I like the idea that it's a very small and simple game, but that's it.

I don't know if it was because I played badly, but the game ended flat. It ended like if we were in the middle of the action, so I would have liked the game to continue.

I am also not a fan of historical game, so it's really bad for me.

First play left me a bit unsatisfied.  Will see if future plays (assuming they occur) will change that perception.  Sure seems difficult for the French to be successful, but reading some of the comments seem to indicate a fair bit of play and experience may find it difficult for the Spanish to win.  Who knows?  Not sure if I care enough to find out!  Does play very quickly (15-20 minutes).

RATING: 8
* Tense
- The game flows quickly (turns are short, options are simple but numerous), even on the first game.
- There are multiple fronts, and multiple things to do (destroy all Spanish troops, secure the gates, without securing too many casualties).
- You really have a feel of control (despite the random cards that your opponent might play on you), which makes you take the orders you give very seriously, and brings the pleasure of knowing what you do.

* Interesting mechanics (all seen before, but used in a nice way)
- Hidden, simultaneous movement (similar to the simultaneous card play in LotR: the Confrontation): it keeps the game rolling. Also, one has to guess what the opponent will do based on some hard information too (the cubes in the map, the cards played), which makes the thinking deeper than in, say, Skull. Finally, mistakes in the guesses show, so the stakes are much higher than in, say, Race for the Galaxy. 
- Special power cards that influence cubes (1960)
- Area control with cubes (1960)

* Beware!  I seems that, at least at the beginning, it is harder to win with the Spaniards.  That's how my wife and I feel, and this momentarily turned her off, because she did not see the point of playing: playing the Spaniards, she felt, was too easy, without much challenge, while playing the French was to hard (why fight when you're doomed?).  Now, we consider that the Spaniards have a goal, beyond winning: they must win in the smallest possible number of turns.  This gives us a challenge, and makes the game more worth playing.

RATING: 8
[b]A great, tense 2-player cat-and-mouse game of trying to outguess your opponent's moves.[/b]
r{[i]One of the most satisfyingly thematic games I've played.[/i]}r

SYNOPSIS
Spanish mob scattered throughout the map of Madrid are surrounded by French troops closing in on their positions. Limited movement recorded in secret and occurring simultaneously each turn leads to possible confrontations when both sides find themselves occupying the same location. Play continues for a possible ten turns or until either the French sustain too many casualties or all Spanish are defeated. Event cards provide opportunity for surprise moves and altered win condition.

COMMENTS
I enjoy introducing friends to this unique game as it quickly builds suspense from the first turn onward with plenty of "Aha!" and "Gotcha!" moments interspersed throughout it's short play time. There's plenty of room for cleverness and second guessing which just makes the experience delightful.

PROS+, CONS- & NOTES*
+ I really enjoy the replay value of switching over to play the opposing side's different objective.
+/- Event cards might mitigate or exacerbate one's situation, leading to moments of surprise or angst. Familiarity with the cards from repeated play helps to anticipate the results of those situations.
* The historical narrative and history of the game's theme is fascinating to read in the included material.

I’ve finally admitted to myself that I’m just not much of a wargamer. I can’t really bring myself to care about supply routes, sieges, and other such stuff. Yet, every now and then, a wargame comes along which downplays a lot of the minutiae and "realism" in favor of, for me, a fun gaming experience with a war theme. 2 de Mayo packs a very satisfying and even detailed game into a pretty quick, easy-to-learn package.

This was a holy grail two-player game for my husband and I for a long time. Then, after figuring out the rules and playing twice (reversing roles), we learned that the job of the Spanish is to get completely gutted. It's kind of emotionally devastating! That's effective in its own right, but it hasn't made us too eager to play again.

Love the historical theme.  But after just a few plays the games seemed to all blend together... with the same moves.  And the euroness of it becomes so dominant you lose a sense of purpose and historical context.

Another game that appeals to the history lover in me.  It's a nice little 2 player strategy game.  It contains fairly simple, but nice, components.  The rules are a little wordy and repetitive, but it's not a huge deal.  Over all 2 de Mayo is a good game for two.

RATING: 8
Good historical simulation game that uses a clever area control mechanic proving that you can also find "eurogames" with strong theme. The historical reserch work of the designer is something you appreciate in the rulebook and of course in every card. In terms of mechanics, the Simultaneous action selection and the asymetry of the strategy for both sides are definitely something to highlight. The components are also nice and the duration of the game make it perfect for playing it after dinner before going to bed.

Obtained 06/23/09. 
07/21/09 Played once and it went down to the wire (turn ten). It appears the game has a slight Spanish bias. But not enough to put me off it. I'm glad I added 2 de Mayo to my game collection, as its very different from anything else I have. Initially I was somewhat leery of the plotted movement, but it proved to not be the cumbersome burden/nuisance I feared. Yet in light of it I feel a pad of plotting sheets should have been included in the game. Giving me one, and basically telling me to "go find a photocopier" seemed tacky/cheap. For that reason the game lost a rating point.   
05/19/12 Played twice, both easy French victories. Now I think it has a French bias. More games are needed to settle the bias question. 
09/14/13 Game #4: French victory on turn 8. 
06/07/14 Game #5: Spanish victory on turn 8. 
02/14/15 Game #6: French victory on turn 9.

I can't believe I'm saying this, but there [i]is[/i] such thing as too much theme. Don't get me wrong, 2 de Mayo is a wonderful 2 player logic/bluffing game, a real nail-biter. The historical theme fits and works really well, the background informations are astonishing, yet for who don't know the game it could misleadingly seem as a wargame which it really isn't. So if you are not all for history or wargames, but if you like deductive games, like [thing=21763][/thing], you should definitely give it a try.

Impressive little abstract game that has a lot of historical flavor.  It has a lot going for it: theme, gameplay, and superb graphics compliment each other very well; it plays fast and has no downtime; and it has a great historical narrative in the rulebook.  All types of gamers should appreciate this design.

I just couldn't get into this. Between the awful graphic design, plain-looking board, and lame cubes representing your units, this felt like a prototype. It doesn't help that the game utilizes Spanish as the primary language. I get that this is to help set the mood that this takes place in Spain, but it was a real hurdle to overcome, even for someone like me who knows a decent amount of Spanish. All this game is, is hidden troop movement with a small amount of card play. Nothing special at all.

So far it hasn't really "clicked" for me and any of my opponents yet I still want to play it. The short playtime helps. EDIT: Okay my fifth game, the second with the wife, where she pulled off some devious moves and bluffs and beat me, finally made it click. I definitely like this game.

An excellent game with a bit more strategy than initially appears.  The asymmetry adds a great bit of depth.  Strong link of theme to game mechanics creates an atmosphere that you can feel and see. The randomness of the cards simulates the chaos of battle and also adds to replay value.  A gem of a game....and short too!

Interesting historical simulation area majority/mousetrap game. My wife describes it as feeling like the aristocratic (bastard) child of Mr.Jack, Battleships and 1960:Making of the President - which is pretty much how it feels. The short playing time and compact form makes it a very good travel game. What is a bit iffy for me is the overtly nationalistic undertones of this game - it becomes especially slippery as this is presented as a wargame. This does not as such impact my score, but it leaves some uncomfortable afterthoughts.

I quite like this little wargame.

It is rich with history, but has a streamlined design that works very well in spite of its 30 minute playing time.

Simultaneous orders really make the game, allowing a cat-and-mouse aspect that makes things exciting and tense.

While not a wargame in the sense that most wargamers are familiar with, 2 de Mayo would make an excellent stepping stone for a Eurogamer who wanted to venture into more conflict-oriented games.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
While some two-player games have used secret orders in the classic Diplomacy fashion (the excellent WarpWar comes to mind), Dos de Mayo is difficult to better as far as playing time is concerned (twenty to thirty minutes). Moreover, the topic of choice (the uprising in Madrid against Napoleon's troops in 1808) is introduced very nicely: Spanish units will most likely be beaten most of the times, so that instead of fighting chest to chest against the mightier French units they've got to play cat and mouse with them to spread them thin, scraping what they can on the way and maybe saving a unit of their own at the end.

The amount of rules to be assimilated at the start of play is more than a couple, but it doesn't achieve wargame proportions at all. The game itself is very thrilling and actually rather replayable even though it follows more or less the same patterns every time; the cards in a player's hand can influence tactical play decisively (especially considering all the room available for bluffing).

An intriguing asymmetric war game with a solid belt of history behind it. You feel occasionally that the game mechanics are being bent to match the historic niceties, but it feels balanced enough.

Really nice little cat-and-mouse war game. Playing this head-to-head makes me realize how brilliant this game really is, as it can play out so many ways. 

In addition, the Event Cards allow for even more outcomes--potentially critical ones--depending upon when and how they're played. Definitely a two-player brain-burner.

A clever and tense asymmetrical 2 player that has the benefit of potentially being only 20 minutes long, but can be a more drawn-out affair for thinkers, be warned. I think of the game as a war-themed Scotland Yard, with the French closing down avenues of escape and trying to guess where the Spanish will run to next. The Dip style move write-down shouldn't be a turnoff if you're a fan of games with smarts. You'll need to eventually learn and master the card possibilities to do well, adding another layer of double-guessing. Solid theme is an attraction.

Each player (the French or the Spanish) has specific movement rules. The French can only make two moves per turn, while the Spanish can make as many as they want. However, the French can split up, while the Spanish cannot. Select your movements in secret and try to either survive (Spanish) or capture all of the opponent while blocking the city exits. Well thought out and a lot of fun, plus the cards allow for some surprises from your opponent, subtle advantages, but if timed right, can be a great help.

Very cool light war/euro. The board and cards are beautiful, and the bilingual cards w/ emphasis on the Spanish really adds a lot to the historical feel.

Gameplay is fast and engaging (though I haven't gotten anywhere near the 20 mins others report). Players draw a card from their nation's deck, secretly write down their orders, reveal and carry out the orders, then resolve any battles. Each turn takes a few minutes tops but still offers a lot of room for good play and strategy. I really like the blind action choice and asymmetry between the sides. 

I'm surprised at comments in the forum suggesting that the Spanish side is over-powered. I've only seen 2 Spanish wins in my 7 games. It's hard for me to read this one way or another, as many of these have been first time plays for one or another player, but my impression so far is that the balance is fine.

A very minimalist historic war game. Very few components and cards. It can be fun, but its an acquired taste that grows on you once you get to learn the possible openings and card events. There is not much to do in the game other than move a couple of cubes and count casualties. Its a nice small heads up game for what it is. I was expecting a little more. The rule book was atrocious.

Has a nice atmosphere with historical artwork and theme on the cards and board. However, the board is too small and hard to see the borders on some areas. And despite the colorful setting, game play is rather dry.

The cards are much too important to the outcome of the game, it all depends on drawing the right cards at the right time, and this randomness undermines the game's strategy (and fun) too much.

I'd been wanting to try this for quite some time and I'm pleased to say that it did not disappoint. It's an asymmetrical cat-and-mouse game with very simple rules and a heavy dose of psychology, just the kind of attributes I like. It reminds me of a favourite of mine, King of Siam, in its minimalism and level of abstraction. Rating could move up with further plays and I am keen to find out how different it feels to play the other side.

Good little war game. Like other wargame, luck will play a big part of the game. The  cards will affect the outcome depending on if your lucky or not to draw the cards in the right sequence. The cat and mouse feel of the game is not bad but not over exciting also. The material is sheap for the price and the board is hard to read. It should have been made bigger. The rules seem clear and simple but unanswered questions will pup up trough out the game, specially concerning the cards resolution. One of his main advantage is the the playing time that is relatively short; 30 to 45 minutes.

Bon petit jeu de guerre. Comme tous les jeux de guerre, la chance joue un rôle important selon que vous êtes en mesure de piger les cartes dans le bon ordre ou non. Le jeu du chat et de la souris est intéressant mais on ne peut dire qu'il est très excitant. Le matériel est très ordinaire pour le prix du jeu et le plateau est difficilement lisible.Ce dernier aurait pu être plus grand. Les règles semblent claires et simples à la lecture, mais lors de vos parties, plusieurs questions resteront sans réponses, spécialement concernant la résalution des cartes. Un de ses points forts est le temps de jeu qui est relativement cout, soit de 30 à 45 minutes.

- It's quick and portable.
- Assymetrical forces give each side different strategies.

The downside:
- Balance issues are always something to incur on in this type of games.

A fast asymmetric wargame with scope for bluff. This is a simple but enjoyable game that has a strong theme despite the abstract nature of the components. It is interesting for both sides, but I am pretty sure the Spanish can force a win barring bizarre card draws, or at the very least there is a stereotyped line of play. The written orders shouldn't put people off as they are usually just (for a whole turn) 6->5 and 12->14: not too daunting is it!?

Top notch art and components, multilingual cards, and loads of historical info - seriously, EXTREME kudos to all who had a hand in the development and production of this game. As for the gameplay, I picked this up looking for a quick, fun wargame, and in that regard it was very successful. Games never drag on (in fact, they can't!) and the simultaneous move orders keep things interesting. Still, in the few times I've played so far, it seems like a Spanish victory is much harder to attain than a French victory. I am sure I just need to play more and try different ideas. I think if/when I pull off a Spanish victory (or even if I'm on the losing side of one) my 'wow' moment will occur and my rating of this game will skyrocket. Barring even that, though, I highly recommend this game.

Asymetric 2p game based on the occupation of Madrid by French troops and the ensuing popular uprising.

RATING: 7
Players write down their moves, then reveal and execute those moves simultaneously. This changes finding the optimal move from a purely computational exercise to a psychological one.

In games with alternating activation, given enough time and attention to the board state, a player could figure out all the possible permutations, and from those, his or her optimal move. 

It's different in a game in which players decide their moves simultaneously. A player might know all the moves his opponent could possibly make, and all the appropriate counters to those moves, but the exact moves an opponent will make is a toss up. So a player has to guess, given what they know about their opponent and how their opponent has played so far, what actions the opponent is most likely to take.

(Of course, it's always possible to reach a state where none of a player's moves are strategically viable, and so it's almost irrelevant which move the other makes)

Many players complain that luckless or near luckless games lack surprise, or that "wow" factor when something unexpected occurs. They then turn around and decry other games with random elements as luckfests, where the individual skill of the players matters less than the luck of the draw. Simultaneous actions may be a way to give otherwise luckless or near luckless games a "wow" factor without robbing players of their sense of agency.

Unexpected discovery at Essen 2008.  Truly beautiful production of a small press game, with bilingual rules and cards (Spanish/English).  A simple elegant wargame with simultaneous movement orders (that are not cumbersome due to low number of them being done!) and a bit of randomness from drawing a special card each turn, playable in 20 minutes!

Good challenge. Light and quick. Thankfully it seems to have been well play tested. Can play a little differently each outing.

A cat and mouse type of game that feels abstract and, paradoxically, very thematic at the same time.  The players really look themselves inmersed in the events that happened that day of 1808, when the Spanish Independence War started.  Even when everybody says that it is easier to play with the Spaniards, our brief experience with the game goes in favor of the French Imperial Army.

My first wargame since high school - pitting the Spanish civilians and a few soldiers against the occupying army in a battle to free Madrid from Napoleon's forces.

The game, which is bilingual Spanish/English is based on a real battle that occurred on May 2, 1808. For a game that lasts 10 turns and only takes 20-30 minutes, it is tense back and forth play as the Spaniards, far outnumbered by French forces, struggle valiantly.

Like a better version of Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation and Mr. Jack (though The Confrontation still gets the nod because of theme). Predict what your opponent will do, with elegant asymmetry between the forces. At its core, this is basic rock-paper-scissors, but also a good simulation of military command, where you're probably doing that anyway, and trying to out-think the opposition based on past tendencies. Ultra-quick game-time and the "could've, should've" after the game leave you wanting more.

The cards seem very tacked on for the sake of theme, and could be implemented better.

================

Loving this game more (from 7 to 8). I like asymmetric games where there is a brute force (French), and a guerilla force that has to be constantly on the move while engineering precise surgical strikes when they make sense. Made even more interesting since the Spanish have the advantage early. The Spanish has to stall and remain flexible, then decide whether to go for the delay or blitz victory depending on the situation and the cards. Once you commit to the blitz (the gamble), there's no going back (since you can't split those cubes up).

I'm still not convinced the Spanish can win if the French doesn't make a single mistake, but in reality, the French often do (I've lost all 3 games as the French :blush:). I use drunkenKOALA's elegant tweak that makes it more interesting/asymmetric from the start: each player starts with an extra card in hand (besides Artillery/Murat and Jose Molina y Soriano). Helps the Spanish slightly since they have a lot of cards that say "play before Turn X".

Ciekawa i specyficzna gra traktująca o szturmie francuzów na Madryt w 1808 r. Dość proste zasady (po zapoznaniu się z treścią kart wydarzeń) i szybka rozgrywka. Ciekawym elementem gry jest sterowanie oddziałami za pomocą zapisywania "rozkazów". Wykonanie gry na wysokim poziomie.

[4 plays] This is what a light quick wargame should aspire to be. Fun, fast, easy to learn, intuitive to play, and well produced. If it was based on an era that interested me more and if it had just a touch less randomness in the cards I could heartily rate it a 9 or a 10. Highly recommended.

Most recent plays 9-27-11 with Garrett.

RATING: 7
Clever little 'wargame' that packs a fair bit with little components.

Each player moves their pieces around the board by writing and executing written orders (how quaint).

Toss in 'action' cards which 'break' the rules. The Spanish (red) player is trying to last the game by foiling the French (blue) player's attempts at wiping them out (and securing four corners of the board).

The French start with the disadvantage but quickly gain in numbers. THe Spanish start stronger but have to outlast the French as their numbers dwindle.

The system is simple but clever though I doubt there would be much replayability!

RATING: 9
 20-30 minutes of maneuvering around and trying to outthink your opponent. Asymmetry, tension, an interesting and touching historical theme and great aesthetics. 2 players strictly. 

 It always amazes me when a game small in everything manages to offer such a complete gaming experience, at least equal to that offered by "epic" monsters.


If you are thinking about it, you are wasting your time- go get it, it's a sleeper.


UPDATE> I find the hidden orders and simultaneous move mechanic to be a FAR more suitable mechanic to reconstruct any conflict than dice rolling and Igo-yougo is. My opinion.

[i]Ugly Little Game of Cat + Mouse. The Design of the Cards is Mind Boggling, but the Core Mechanics and Mind Games are Fun[/i]

Interesting mini-game of mind games and strategy. 

The issue I have with this one is the cards you draw, which add a necessary layer to the game, but...

The cards are weird. There aren't very many of them, they're super powerful, and many of the best ones if you don't draw them with card X, or before round Y, you don't get to use them. Seems like quite a big swing and I don't get the benefit to designing them this way at all.

A wonderful light and quick wargame with some interesting deduction elements.  It has a cat-and-mouse like feel to it that reminds me a bit of Scotland Yard.

Nice, quick asymmetric 2-player game. The rules are pretty simple -- yay! It looks like you're just pushing cubes around, but it's much more interesting than King of Siam (where you really are just pushing cubes around!). Still, despite the historical context (mostly conveyed through the cards and board setting), it is pretty abstract. The simultaneous action selection helps maintain the tension throughout -- fun stuff!

This is a small box 2-player war game.  This really isn't my thing, I just don't like war games with a static setup.  This one is designed to be played quickly and I will admit does cleverly pack a decent sized punch in a small box with a board, some cubes, and a small deck of cards.

I can certainly see for fans of this style of game this would make a great, accessible, 2-player filler but I just prefer other types of games to this one.  The balance does seem to be there.  Even though the Spanish are completely outnumbered their victory condition is a little more lenient.  The outguessing style of gameplay can be nice as well.

If this sounds like you're thing, I can certainly see this appealing to many.  Just not me.

If you like the cat and mouse fight this could be a good game for you. I was misleaded by my fellow gamers who made me believe that this could be a deep strategic game. I'm sure that 2 de Mayo is a good game but it's some how very random for my taste and I tend to think of it as a simple lucky driven filler for 2 players. A nice design though.

I'm torn on 2 de Mayo. Mechnically it's very nice, save for the clunky order system which is greatly improved by adding two minimaps with dry-erase pens (draw arrows for movement). It's historical, asymmetrical, imposing agonizing decisions, yet plays quickly. It's a game I want to love.

My problem, though, is that while the French play "cat", hunting and closing off escape routes, a competent French player will only ever lose on time -- the Spaniards ("mouse") outlasting their historical defeat. That's the way it's supposed to go, but it's a heavily artificial constraint on an otherwise organic game system and achieving it feels cheap. Because the game is so strongly rooted in bluff/double-bluff secret movement, this cheap win can also come down to an opponent guessing rightly or wrongly at a key point. Throw in the luck of the cards (for the Spanish, typically both worse and only usable in highly conditional circumstances) and it's an irritating, unsatisfying experience.

Basically, it isn't as much fun as I feel like it should be. Win or lose, it doesn't feel good. Still, it's intriguing... I traded my copy away and [-]already I'm fighting the urge to buy it all over again[/-] saw another copy cheap and bought it within the space of three weeks.

This quite unusual 2pl. game hits a sweet spot for me. There is asymetrical play for the both sides : movement rules, two different decks of cards and different victory conditions also. There is a good amount of decisions and thought for a quite short playing time (30min). Plus, it has a very original theme and beautiful cards and map. One difficulty is the availability of this title : either at Essen Spiel, or through a direct order at a Spanish online retailer.

Blind simultaneous movement and simplified game rules create a fantastic game of cat and mouse.  It's a very simple game, but it's by no means easy or boring.  There's a tight time limit to the game and every move is a struggle.  Advantages can be gained or lost in a moment with good decision making.

This is NOT a wargame, it's a hidden movement game that simulates a war effort.  It's really quite good and for the length of game and weight, it's hard to find anything more entertaining.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A game that at first glance appears to be greatly imbalanced but is actually very cleverly designed, although perhaps too biased towards the Spanish side (it's really difficult to win as the French, which is a complete contrast to the actual historical events the game is based on). The cat and mouse tactics that you employ whilst controlling either the French and Spanish forces really draw you into the game and there's far more variety in the gameplay than would first appear, with the event cards adding some very welcome randomness. The visual look, although quite simplistic, is very well done (quite Goyaesque) and adds to the experience. It's also a very quick game to play (30 minutes maximum) but doesn't feel any less absorbing because of that.

RATING: 6
[gameid=36522] is an abstract game simulating the events of May 2nd, 1808, where civilians and a few Spanish Army units rebelled against the occupying French forces of Napoleon.

The nature of the game is for the 10 Spanish units to survice 10 turns, whereas the French have to eliminate all insurgents, garrison all exits and limit their loses to a maximum of 3 units. A game plays in 20-30 minutes and is full of tense moments. Each player simultaneously gives out orders (writing them on paper), cards can be played and movemement is carried out. Finally the resolution of contested areas takes place.

There is a no doubt a fine game in here. It requiers a familiarity with the cards in order to have an overarching strategy, though the game is playable as is from the go. 
I imagine there is a great deal of bluff in a well-executed plan. Leaving an area apparently weak, only to bring in re-inforcements through card play and that sort of thing.

We failed to become immersed in the conflict and felt no connection with the theme. It merely became a game of pushing cubes round the board, trying to outmanouver the opponent. The problem for us is the utter lack of theme. We bought the game because it was getting rave reviews as a great 2 player game. The afterthought was to determine if the abstract nature of the game would speak to us - it did not.

I do not rate it highly on a personal level, but would urge anyone interested in abstract 2 player games with a historical setting to check it out.

2 plays in, and it's hard to say anything yet.  It is a very simple game, but seems like it needs a few plays to fully understand everything.  So far, 2 plays is not enough.  

Beautiful artwork, small footprint, quick playing time.  Might be a little tough to teach an inexperienced player how to play, and have them pick up the game right away (read:  if someone is liable to dislike a game that they cannot be competitive at on the initial play, they might not like it).

I give it an 8 after just two plays. After our first play, the game seemed way too unbalanced in favor of the Spanish side. It ended in the first 5 turns. Then we played the second game, after understanding the mechanics, cards, and strategies a little more, it went down to the final movement and a guess for which spot each of us would choose. Spain won, but it just as easily could have gone in France's favor.

I like this game. It combines a few great mechanics that all blend well: the tactical cards, the simultaneous orders for movement, and the drama in choosing well or poorly. And boy is it tense! Its amazing historical tie-in to actual events makes it an exciting history lesson too. I recommend it for couples everywhere.

I almost chose 2 de Mayo from the prize table at BGG.CON 2008, but went with Duel of Ages 1 & 2 instead. Ever since then I'd been wanting to try 2 de Mayo to see what I was missing and thankfully in December I finally had that opportunity. I played it twice back-to-back, switching sides in between, because it's an asymmetric game of combat between the French and the Spanish. The two sides play very differently, which is always something I appreciate in a game (e.g., Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation, Mr. Jack), particularly when the two sides are reasonably balanced. It's a quick game played on a tight board where players secretly and simultaneously write down their orders (a la Diplomacy) and then reveal and resolve. The movement and combat are luckless affairs except for the cards that each player is drawing from his or her individualized deck that provide special powers. I wasn't wholeheartedly won over by the game, but I did enjoy my two plays of it and would be more than happy to play it again. It felt surprisingly abstract despite the fairly clear integration of theme into the different movement rules for the two sides and the different deck of cards for each side. However, it had many virtues, not least of which were its speed, asymmetry, and streamlined nature, so it's worth investigating for anyone searching for another Super Filler for 2.

This is definitely not the kind of game I'm pining to play on a regular basis, but it's clever and fun. I like simultaneous movement, and this has it in spades. The game seems ridiculously unbalanced in favor of the Spanish. I played against a gamer with much more tactical gaming experience than myself. He absolutely CRUSHED me in the 4th round when he played the Spanish, but he still couldn't beat me when he took the role of the French (I ran out the clock). If he could beat me so readily as the Spanish, he should have been able to at least eek out a win for the boys in blue.

One of two games that "made my year" this year. I discovered it, when I was trying to find interesting block wargame that utilizes secret-unit deployment system. 
It attracted my eyes with photos of the box and the innings. The mechanic (should tell you that i'm a fan of good old Diplomacy game) of unit transition is very interesting, also you can modify different actions with combat cards from your deck of 11 cards. 
But the best stuff I discovered about this game was the theme - May 2, 1808. The day when people of Madrid rebeled against Napoleon's forces and started The Independance War. It was a day when even women fought against french forces with scissors, kitchen knives or even barehanded. Actually, I won't tell you the story of May the 2nd, 1808. Check it on your own, it's quite interesting.

So, as i've said IMO it's best descendant of Diplomacy in 2 player variant. And it's not a filler game i think, because every turn has to be planned carefully.

Currently, I'm translating the rules of this game and will contact publisher or game designer in order to publish them online.

This is another of those games that doesn't sound like much just from reading the rules, but winds up being pretty impressive, nonetheless.  It plays quickly, but doesn't lose the importance of making the decisions one needs to make to do well at the game.  The game plays on a very small scale, but not so small that the moves feel forced or fixed.  The random card draw adds a little variety to the game, and saves it from being scripted, as the game starts out the same each time.  In our first game, it looked like I was going to have a runaway win, but as we were packing up the game after calling it a few turns early, we realized that it wasn't as clear cut as it had appeared.  We talked about our options for a few minutes after the game ended, and that's always a good sign.  It's a perfect miniature wargame, and could even serve as a great introduction to that type of game for players new to the genre.

I've only played as the Spanish and have both won and lost.  When I won, I felt there was no way I could have lost; and when I lost, I felt there was no way I could have won!  I think this is one where you really need to watch every move and play your cards well.  I really like the simple ruleset and the way the simultaneous action selection makes the game so quick to play.  It makes me want to come back for a rematch to try out a new strategy without feeling burned out on the game.

This is a fun 30 minute or so hidden movement game with an interesting history lesson about the Spanish revolt in Madrid against the occupying forces of Napolean. The game plays out like cops and robbers, with the French trying to round up the insurgents, while the rebels try to isolate, overwhelm and destroy the French troops and then vanish before they are caught.

The map is very small, so the cat and mouse game isn't inherently difficult but a couple of cool twists keep things interesting. First, the French troops are absolutely forbidden to run away from an insurgent, so a single rebel cube can pin down a whole unit. On the flip side, the Spanish insurgent cubes behave as a mob. They can move freely as long as they are alone, but as soon as they meet up with another cube they become bound and have to move together for the rest of the game. In this way, the Spanish slowly lose mobility but gain the ability to fight back. Balancing this and correctly timing when to mob up and when to flee to the quiet parts of town is where the meat of the game is, for both players.

There is also a small deck of events that shake things up and enable a few endgame strategies, which players learn after a game or two that really enhance the experience, both for their game effects and for the wonderful slice of history they portray. If I have to live in the era of the micro/filler game, this is the kind of thing I need to keep me engaged and interested!

A tiny and tidy asymmetrical wargame.  Asymmetry in movement rules, number of units, cards available, victory conditions.  The map, the cards, and the rulebook are very artfully detailed which really evokes the history of the event of 2 de Mayo.  Easy to learn but decisions can be excruciating.  So much great game play, art, and history in such a little box with very few components and playable in a half hour or less.  Very impressive.

A fast 2-player game with good tension based on the events of the day in question.  One of the better 2-player filler games to come out for 08.

Nice, quick two-player "wargame" cat-and-mouse affair.  Need to play more but so far so good.

Update: Game is asymmetrical in favor of the Spanish.  I have played the French twice and lost.  Very interesting game though; a mano-a-mano affair. Plays in 30 minutes or less.  Solid 8.

Fun little game, takes about 30-40 minutes but could be faster I think.

Difficult to play as the Spanish, a lot of double guessing going on.

Loving this more and more: the semi-scripted nature of the war game means that there is some replayability but it does feel like a simulation

I can see the great game in here, but we just aren't wargamers (even though this one is pretty light).

After a couple of plays of this cat and mouse game. I look forward to playing some more. Small enough to slip to a game session without taking much room.

Even though I was completely eviscerated in my first attempt, this "hammer vs. anvil" exercise seemed to have a lot of potential.  The secret orders (cf. Quebec 1759) are a definite plus, and the length of play can't be beat.

An instant replay, in honor of my Spanish defeat:

Aunque estaba eviscerado por completo en mi primer intento, este "martillo contra el yunque" ejercicio parecen tener un gran potencial. Las órdenes secretas (cf. Quebec 1759) son una ventaja definitiva, y la duración del juego no puede ser vencido.

A really good small war game. The assymmetric sides make it especially good for playing twice and switching sides between games. A good challenge for both sides.

At first the rules seem unclear, but gameplay is very intuitive. Moves quick but can be really tense trying to predict your opponents next move.

Great "cat and mouse" game with asymmetric forces.  I liked the game we played, but my wife was less than enthused.

During our first game, I took it down to the last turn with one remaining Spanish force.

After missing out on this game at Spiel '08, I finally played and bought it at Spiel '09. It is an excellent cat and mouse game of asymmetrical forces battling each other. The fact that Spain is basically only trying to improve on the historical outcome, even though they are bound to actually lose the battle makes for great gameplay!. It has the feel of a cosim, but plays very quickly and you cannot play just once.

Al principio resulta curioso, después de varias partidas descubres que el juego está roto y que el autor y la editorial deberían testear mejor sus productos.

Un diez para el diseño y la ambientación, aunque me da la impresión de que se toma partido del lado monárquico. El juego no está mal, pero me resulta demasiado corto.

I like this game more and more. It's simple and intruguing, smart and elegant. Sometimes it will be difficult to manage the situation, if the difference in luck (card draw) is too large, but, I think, this is quite remote.

Again, I've yet to meet the Level99 game that I didn't like. Sellswords is a neat little tile laying and flipping game where you use attack and defense values to conquer a 5x5 grid for scoring after two rounds. Cute chibi fantasy artwork and plenty enough strategy for such a small package. While it might seem a little abstract, the abilities of each of the class cards are pretty thematic, and due to its grid-like nature this is an easy recommend for fans of stuff like Pixel Tactics, Dungeon Twister: The Card Game and Knizia's Kingdoms. Good stuff.

Loved how this came together.  Like all level99 games it takes a while the first time you play just due to all the text and options, but it feels like a game that can really fly once you've played it just a couple times. The back and forth is great and the abilities lead to some very fun upsets.

I always lose when playing with husband, but it doesn't stop being fun. Since we both like drafting mechanics we're a big fan of this game.  You draft 6 tiles from a 12-card stack, then place your tiles to try to flip the other person's tiles to your color.  Each tile has a special ability and attack power on each of the four sides. Once you place your first set of 12, you do another 12. 

Apparently like some sort of mini game from FF9. Game-play is quick if you don't take too long drafting.  Lovely game with a take-that aspect that's fun.

Triple Triad from Final Fantasy 8 in physical card game form, increased to a 5x5 grid and with much better balancing. Drafting is very important to pay attention to, as picking the wrong cards can change the flow of the game immensely in your opponents favour. Will take a few games to understand optimal drafting strategies. There's a few rules ambiguities which can be annoying to deal with.

I have come to the realization that I am not a fan of Level 99 games and that is a shame. I really like their concept, the crazy powers and the cute and nice art, but the game play itself it just stresses me out. To me it feels like a chaotic mess of never knowing what to do. I get the feeling with every single game this company puts out. :(. This comment is mostly for myself to not give in and by this game no matter how cheap it is.

RATING: 7
Pretty fun game of back and forth.  The card abilities give the basic game of comparing numbers a nice twist and I gotta be honest, the artwork gives it just that extra nudge.

In some ways, it reminds me a lot of Triple Triad from Final Fantasy 8.  If you're familiar with that, you'll have a decent understanding of how this game works.

Essentially, players take turns playing and orienting cards, comparing adjacent numbers.  If the number on your card is higher, you flip the adjacent card to your color if it's not already there.  The trick is that each time you play a card, its ability kicks in before you make your comparisons, giving this game a strategic/tactical edge.  In the basic game, players will be drafting tiles (actually cardstock, mind you) into their hands, but there are several other variants and abilities that will have you drawing from the deck instead/as well.

Great two player game to kill some time and it's highly portable, too!

This game is underrated.  It's simple, fun, easy to teach, cheap, and fits in your pocket.  Can be played casually or competitively.  Lots of "oh, crap!  I forgot about that" or "didn't see that" moments.  Very high skill cap and strategy ceiling, which I love.  Extra gameplay modes and cards ensure high replay value.

Excellent artwork and components.  Sturdy material.  Even if cards get messed up a little or worn, it makes no difference gameplay-wise unlike most card games.

The middle was delightful, but the early game and endgame had too much freedom and too little (respectively), making decisions feel obvious.

The combos are a little too 'loose' to make the drafting exciting... I mean, drafting is fun, but as far as I can tell you're not committing to any overall strategy and there's little point in hate-drafting.

Don't be fooled, this game IS A COPY of "Triple Triad" from Final Fantasy VII and Quad Mist from Final Fantasy IX.

I created myself, long time ago a version of this game to play at school in lunch time, with creatures and monstes from all sorts of video game franchises.

Since it is the same game just converted into a physical card game... woooahh man it is god damm cool! 
The game is awesome! easy to play hard to master. Very strategic and the artwork is cute as it should be. Excellent version from lvl99games!

I love this little game but wish they would have put more work into the rules and explaining the cards. Have checked a few and perhaps its misprints on the cards but like the Monk for example isn't suppose to be continuous but is listed so on the rules sheet and the card itself but one of the makers says differently. Still, outside of the rules lacking, mostly an easy game to figure out if you can get past that and quite fun.

I'm not normally a fan of Level 99 Games, but this one was actually really good! The rules are very simple, but I like how the different character cards play off each other. It sort of feels like a better-developed Pixel Tactics. Some of the cards still have some awkward wording, but the rules include an extensive list of clarifications. I'd really like to play a game from this company that is slightly more involved than this, but still retains the same amount of fun. Unfortunately, well-designed games like this one seem to be hard to find in their library.

Level 99 Games doesn't really shy away from displaying its Japanese video game influences. So when I heard they were making an unofficial board game adaptation of the only part of Final Fantasy VIII that ever got my attention - its card mini-game - I was rather excited. Sellswords however ends up having issues that prevent me from liking it as much as I want to. Drafting is in most games about reading what opponents are doing and what is open to you. For as far as I could be asked to play, card synergy in Sellswords seemed pretty poor. So the only reason I can imagine for drafting being the default distribution method is because, as far as design considerations go, the variety of their effects has taken precedence over individual card balance; which is confirmed by actual gameplay.

Now even if I'm generous and consider drafting to be a good fix for imbalance, once the drafting process is over, due to the large grid, Sellswords starts sharing a lot with many positional abstract games, in the sense the opening moves are semi-random (which is not very interesting to me); but then around the mid-point, you suddenly go from a cloudy nebula to completely figuring out how the remainder of the round will be optimally played by both players (which is also not very interesting to me). I guess if you like perfect-information abstracts more than I do but would like them to have more variation in their setup, that's your niche filled.

RATING: 5
I think that if you played this game a lot until it became second nature, it might be great - because certainly the concept is interesting and the spatial aspects and card drafting and grid completion aspects all seem original and compelling.

But in practice, because every card was different and the print was small and the descriptions were terse to keep the amount of text on the cards to a minimum, the actual play experience wound up being 15 seconds of play followed by three minutes of looking in the rule book: "Does his effect trigger immediately, and does it hit just the guy next to him, or does he affect these other cards too - or does his power only trigger later on when you try to attack him?" etc. etc. etc.

IMHO, games that are essentially abstract, shouldn't have that much of a learning curve. Imagine playing chess, except that each player had 52 pieces, each of which did something different and might or might not have yet another function depending on which pieces were near them.

Not awful.  Not particularly ground-breaking either.  Basically a real-world version of an old Final Fantasy minigame...which would be charming if it wasn't such a simplistic game to begin with.  
Basically, you play dominos with a special ability on each domino.  This leads to numerous rule incongruities, which makes what should be a simple game unnecessarily fiddly.  Then, you play again.  
So, like I said, not awful, but not one of Level 99's best, either.

RATING: 7
The best way to describe this game is Othello with drafting and special powers.  This is a two-player game played in two rounds.  Each round starts with several tiles laid out for players to draft.  Each one is the same on either side but in a different player color.  Players take turns drafting these characters and then alternate playing them to the field.

Each tile depicts a character with a number on all 4 sides of the tile.  When placed, those numbers are compared to surrounding tiles.  Any of the other player's tiles that have lower numbers compared to the placed tile are flipped to the current player's color.  The tiles almost all also have a special ability that can be anything from moving other tiles around to switching tiles between players hands.  This makes for a lot of replayability.

The game is a pretty short one if you have a little time to kill with just two players and each of your games is going to be varied with 50 different characters.  The gameplay is reasonably easy but the sheer volume of different powers to read and learn make it a little less accessible.  This game fills a really nice niche of quick 2-player games that is hard to find.

Players begin the game by choosing a color (red or blue) and drafting 6 cards each from a display of 12 cards. One side of the card is red and the other is blue, otherwise the cards are identical in every way. Players then take turns placing cards into a 5x5 grid and comparing them numerically to their opponents adjacent cards (if any).  If your card has a higher value than the adjacent card(s) then you flip your opponents card to match your color. Once players have placed all 12 cards they score the round by determining how many cards they have in each row and column. Players then repeat the process of drafting 12 cards again and continue placing them on the established grid after which scoring is done a final time. The player with the most points after 2 rounds wins. My biggest concern with this game is that it feels a little too easy and checking the giant rules sheet nearly every time you place a card to confirm its ability is slightly annoying.

Sellswords looked too simple for my tastes at first, but it turns out this is a great little game. I love the way it emphasizes tricky plays and cleverness over just filling up the board with your sellswords.

Or so I'm told. *I* don't win, because I'm too focused on pulling off cool moves that don't actually get me anywhere. But my friends, spouse, and family members win all the time, and they assure me that it's because they're tricky and clever and I'm not.

Now THIS is the game that Pixel Tactics wishes it was. It has tons of different powers and a spatial element like Pixel Tactics, but the gameplay here is much more interesting. It's just the Triple Triad card game from Final Fantasy 8, but the drafting, powers, scoring, and variants pack a lot of game into the little box.

I just wish this game came out before Pixel Tactics and we had a ton of expansions already (not that the game needs it, but more powers in this type of game are always welcome). I'm hoping this is popular enough to get the same sort of expansion treatment.

Great game, a lot to think about every turn, cute artwork.

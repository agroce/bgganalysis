Grew up playing with my family so has the great nostalgia effect. A wonderful dungeon crawl that puts what D&D does on paper onto the table and lets you move around, even when the board doesn't change the breath holding moments when you kick in a door and the evil wizard starts grabbing skeletons by the handful and placing them all around you is such an exciting immersive play.

RATING: 9
One of my all time favourites since I was a kid.
A while back my gaminggroup and I played through the Core Adventure Book and Karak Varn. After that one of the players' imagination went wild. He invened Adventures in Naggaroth, the Elder Heroes and hours of hours of Adventure.
The Rules are simple and expandable, its like a mini P&P with figurines.
I also like the fackt, that Characters die pretty easily in this game, what keeps everyone involved at the Edge of their seats all the time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Massively rigged for the heroes to win, which can make it great for kids- maybe that's why I enjoyed it so much growing up
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I'm not a dungeon crawler type of guy, but I have to admit that as a kid I loved this game.  The components were so amazing and the "RPG-in-a-box" style was way ahead of its time.

I think I spent most of my time just making up my own adventures instead of really playing the stock quests.  This definitely colors my opinions about the game.

Honestly, without the nostalgia factor, I don't think this is a game I'd like at all as an adult.  Still, a game that can spark a child's imagination is sort of a special thing.

I must admit that I haven't played it in forever and that this rating is mostly a nostalgia rating. However, I do feel that it would still be up my alley.

RATING: 7
If you analyze the game itself, today, it is not spectacular, but it deserves 7 for the importance it had and nostalgia that it brings. For beginners in board games and RPG is incredible for sure, and one of the best (if not the best) way to start the contact with this world! It happened to me, when I was a kid, after I played once I was crazy to play more and more. Today, facing the options available, I have no desire to play it. *** Best with 4 players ***

One of the better dungeon crawler, simply because it doesn't overcomplicate things. Oddly, having played Descent 2e, I can appreciate what they did well with Heroquest - a fun dungeon bash that you can be playing wihtin a couple of minutes; compare with Descent 2e's 10-minute plus set-up-time, for what amounts to not that much more tactical complexity. This is much better (even if it's still fairly trite), and you could get it in Woolworths; beat that, Fantasy Flight!

I'm not the best person to talk about this game because there's a lot of nostalgic feelings involved on this. In my opinion, it's a classic! The mechanic is simple and works very well. Also there are many missions, so you'll have a lot of fun. The bad side is the art of the game, especially in the Brazilian version, but if it isn't a problem for you to go ahead and play.

This deserves a ten out of nostalgia reasons. I got this game as an 11-year-old, a very long time ago. But I still remember it as if it were yesterday. After a month of whining, to my big surprise, my parents bought this game for me. I immediately asked friends over and we started playing. The game blew us away, beyond our wildest expectations. The game swallowed us in a time-vacuum-bubble and it became a 14 hour marathon that ended when the sun was coming up and the breakfast table was made ready. Boy, did I got the evil eye from my parents!

RATING: N/A
This Edition of HeroQuest features a single huge quest that spans over 4 gameboards. It also includes the henchmen miniatures, which are used as additional strong enemies in the special quest. Otherwise this is basically the HeroQuest base game. If I was rating this box for just the extra content, it would probably be the worst of all the expansions, but since this is not actually an expansion, but an improved base game, I would probablyhave to rate it at an equal level as the base game, because while there is some extra content, it doesn't really feel any better than the 1989 version of the base game.
I'm not going to rate this one at all though, since I never actually played it since owning it and just remember playing the quest during my teens. The box is just sitting beneath my other HeroQuest boxes and is more or less used as a spare part storage.

Added to the base game with better rules, more miniatures and one of the best Quests in the game, I even went overboard and got 4 game boards to play it in style :P This also contains the rare Men at Arms miniatures that were before only found in the Wizards of Morcar expansion set. Certainly a better option if you never got the base game before and not bad if you already have the base game but want more options and a super hard quest.

I love this game for a lot of things. As first for the items, little statues of main characters, enemys that you found on the box, all colorable. As second for the books of adventures that make this game each time new. You can also create a map and your own story. The fantasy setting is not a problem also for players that don't mind fantasy and can find in this game amazing and strategic moments.

A light RPG that I found limited, tedious and boring.

Pros:
* +1 for all male roles.
* Excellent miniatures.

Cons:
* Roll and move.
* Combat system is based too much on luck.
* Not enough ways to heal from damage.
* Very limited armory to purchase new items.
* Traps are annoying and not fun. They either slow the game down or randomly hurt you.
* Game board should have been made of individual tiles.

05-06-2014. Rated after 1 recent play. HeroQuest I've played and enjoyed as a kid. Nowadays, I do not like the game much anymore. I think many games (Descent, Descent 2.0, Doom, Level7: OP, D&D Ashardalon) do what it did a lot better.

Game is ugly by current standards. I think most of the love for the game is nostalgia.

Furthermore, my copy I acquired painted (not too well), but not too bad either.

No nostalgia here so the game just felt dated.  Admittedly I played this game not too long after acquiring my love, Arcadia Quest.

This game was lost to me when moving from my parents home. Played it when I was a kid, and loved it! Just bought the advanced quest edition of ebay!

Zowel de 'nieuwe versie' als alle uitbreidingen. Is eigenlijk D&D voor dummies, maar best aardig. Tenminste: zolang de helden het (intussen nogal verouderde) spelmechanisme niet gaan misbruiken.

I love this game! This was definitely my table top indoctrination, I still have it, still play it, my friends love it. A classic that never grows old.

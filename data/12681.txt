I've seen Neuland described as 'Roads and Boats lite'. The comparison to R&B is obvious and well made as both games have similar mechanisms. What it isn't though is Roads & Boats LITE. A light game this is not. If anything it is more intense than R&B which has a longer, more gradual ramp up of resources and where player interaction doesn't occur for a while (if at all). In Neuland, you can get to the top of the production chain fairly quickly and the limited space means that you are always competing for resources with the other players. I probably prefer the earlier game with it's much less 'in your face' style but the game length makes Neuland more likely to get to the table. The sequence at the end is slightly worrisome and may cause the game to lock up but the rest of the features make it well worth playing - you need to be prepared to have your brains fried though!

A fascinating game of logistics and planning. This falls into that great category of games that I love despite my poor ability at playing. I will need a number of goes at this before I really know what I am doing, but the ride will definitely be an interesting one.

I would not play this with 4 players; 3 is just perfect. Be prepared for a few hours of playtime and the length will not be an issue.

RATING: 6.8
Played once, and won (with all new players). I like the game ok; it's interesting that it took a while (for me at least) to get that the obvious tactical elements are not the ones you need to go for. Instead you need to do strategic clogging of resources, and have a clear plan on how to get to the higher-point buildings. Otherwise, you end up with having your sword built, and lost in the next turn, because you could not complete the other inputs in time (Jesse successfully tested that strategy, and blew all his chances to win).

Played once 2 player and looks to be quite a vicious game of careful timing and blocking, hopefully the player interaction keeps it fresh as the cost and order of VP buildings is always the same.

RATING: 6
A game of using resources, and a tech tree (inherent in the input/output of the developments), in order to score VPs.  The tech tree is somewhat interesting and largely drives the game.  The different terrain types serve more as a limiting factor, a constraint on your plans.  I really liked the clock/timing mechanism -- very innovative/interesting.  It provides a whole other dimension to your strategy.

My biggest negative is that the game is far too long for what it is.  I like the concept of the tech tree, developments, scoring VPs and the clock, but the game takes too long to develop and there is too much planning required.  Turns are often slow and labored as the player tries to figure out first what to do then how to do it.  Not straightforward at all.

There's a fair bit to assimilate.  I would expect the first play to be slow, confusing at times (because of the tech tree) and mildly ponderous.  I would play this with 2 or 3 players.  I think it would be too long with 4.  Try to avoid playing it with the AP-inclined.

I'd play this one again, but only if I were in the right mood and never with 4 players.  Rating could improve, but I'm not hopeful.

Neuland is a potentially solid game. But I need to play it with more people to figure out if it actually has any life. The two player game felt a bit samey and you could see how much tension it was lacking. But I like the logistics angle in a Euro game rather than the resource management angle. It's doing something different and that's cool.

Pretty dry and pretty exacting in how it plays out, having to synchronize all of your goods at the same time.

I was hoping this would be a more accessible Roads & Boats that I could get on the table more often.  Unfortunately, the downtime on this is brutal thanks to the action point allowance system, which is also annoyingly restrictive. I wish I could just do all the things like I can in R&B.

Best heavy euro ever. It just don't get a 10 because I'm an ameritrasher, and my tens go only to games with theme very well implemented, and other ameritrash concepts.

Pretende ser un juego de optimización logística sin factor suerte, pero acaba siendo un quemacerebros inmisericorde.

El manual es para tirarlo directamente a la basura y eso no ayuda precisamente a que el juego guste.

Nekem anno úgy harangozták be, mint ami nehezebb a Caylusnál. Nos ez még akár igaz is lehet, de ettől még nem feltétlen jobb:)

Pozitívumok: egyedi az idő múlása (Glen Moreban ezt másolták le), és érdekes a nyersanyagok megoldása (nem kézzelfoghatóak). A termelőépületek táblázata jól meg lett csinálva.

Negatívumok: elég átláthatatlan a tábla, az épületek 3 különböző szögben állnak, a pontszerző épületek színe is kicsit átláthatatlan. A játék vége kicsit lutri szerintem. Lehet, hogy valaki csak a szükségesnél 3-mal több ponttal tudna nyerni egyszerűen azért, mert erősen korlátosak az épületek: pl. már csak 1 pontja hiányzik a győzelemhez, de már csak 4 pontos épületek vannak. Ezzel pedig előre tervezni szerintem képtelenség. Egy amúgy minimális szerencsefaktorú és viszonylag hosszú (3 órás) játékot kár így elrontani (egyedül a bányáknál van szerencse, de az se vészes)... Ja és a királycsinálás lehetősége is hatalmas.

Nem rossz játék ez, nagyon újító, de nem kiforrott, nem szép, a nyögvenyelős vége miatt nem ad akkora élményt, amekkorát amúgy adhatna.

A resource production game. The manual is useless. I have played about 360 games at the time I am writing this. It is one of the worst manuals I've seen.

I should have another play to rate accurately.

Played once as a 4-player game with the rules explained to me.  This session took over 3 hours to play, which was probably more the fault of the players than the game.  I was pretty bored waiting for other players to move, but I can imagine that the game would play much faster with experienced players.  During my own turns when I could actually do something, I found the game to be a refreshing blend of Worker Placement, Action Points and Jockeying for Turn Order.

I am interested in playing Neuland again for there is a lot to like.  However, I would like to play without mine resources being randomly determined.  I found this rule to be pretty stupid for it made longterm planning a crap-shoot for players building mines.  As for the component quality, I always dislike boards that have interlocking parts.  I am always worried that the connections will become loose and take away from the visual appeal of the game.

Loved the German 1st edition and bought the 2nd edition and I must say I find the graphics cluttered and garish compared to the elegant simplicity of the 1st ed. I miss the wooden pieces.

Original Eggerspiele version with cool wooden pieces. IMHO superior to the Z-Man cardboard reissue.

You read the rules and there seems nothing there. You sit down to play and it all seems a bit of a mess, and then all of a sudden you have this OMYGOD! moment and you realise that you are sitting with a masterpiece. A truly awesome game of plotting, placement, blocking and timing. What took the reprint so long to arrive? Bring on the next game.

One playing with 4.  Seems to largely scratch the same itch as Roads and Boats without all the fiddly bits - not sure yet if that is a good or bad.  Interaction with other players is limited to blocking or rushing to complete the building they are targetting.  Nice pacing and length.

Many interesting ideas. The game is really meaty, but a bit dry and mechanical. The game is not a grabber for me. Very tactical, for you have to secure the possibility to produce trying to block opponents. This is in part milded by the 10 action limit and by the rule that unused products are lost at the end of the second turn.
The game is prone to AP expecially for you cannot plan in advance as you have to wait and see which buildings your opponents keep occupied and which advancements you can try to develop, as they are produced in order for each civ area, from the less important to the one giving more points and costing more.

It's just not my type of game.  I prefer a little luck and less intensity of puzzles.  Also, I don't like all of the defensiveness (avoidance of screwage and thefts).

A game I might like better if I could figure out exactly how it plays. The rules in the box are awful; but, frankly, I don't find the ones here on the Geek much better. I don't see it explained anywhere what you need food for other than to be the start of a chain of production where lumber is required at some point. Yet there are hints that food is actually quite important.

"Resting" baffles me, unless there are times when you don't want to do something and you are on the same stone as another player. Why not "pass?" It is not clear that distance is measured in hexes. Between buildings in the same hex, it appears that the distance is sometimes "one" and sometimes "zero." And so on...

I suspect there could be a decent game here struggling to get out, but with so many really good games available these days, I'm not sure it is worth the struggle.

This is one of the steepest learning curve games I've played recently.  It took me about 5 games to get a good handle on what I'm trying to do.  It's a efficiency engine, pick up and deliver, area control game.  The only thing is that once you get a good handle on the strategy, the game tends to get a bit "samey" and one of the biggest elements of the game is blocking the other player while trying to advance yourself.  Not a bad game and I will definitely be pulling it periodically to play, but it has slipped from my initial rating.

This is a 'if I do this, then I can... and then... and after that... which will allow me to... so I can...' etc. sort of games.  A very good one, and if you like that sort of thing you should really enjoy this one.  I quite liked it and I am not normally a huge fan of this style of game.

Let's be honest.  This isn't a game for all occasions. In fact, not for all players it would seem. 

I noted on the video review the reviewer called it boring in appearance.  And he was referring to the latest American version.  He would have had a fit had he seen the original.  Yes, it is boring in appearance.  He also made the comment that there are no laughs in this game.  Correct again.  It is more inclined to make you cry than laugh.  This is because it is a truly cerebral challenge and if this is what you enjoy now and again then NEULAND might be the game you are looking for.

I regard it as being amongst the very best games on my well-stocked shelves and it is so very perfect in its conception that I would have given it a 10 rating but that would imply a better design standard than it received with this first German edition.  This is no criticism of Eggertspiele.  I'm eternally grateful that they undertook to publish what has to be regarded as a very serious game and not one likely to find popular appeal.

RATING: 6.5
There is a lot to like about Neuland - namely that it packs a lot of strategy into very simple rules with a few clever mechanisms.  Like Caylus, there is almost no luck here (at least when playing with the original rules), so the possibilities for brain-burn abound.  This is close to a pure logistics game, basically Roads and Boats with a condensed geographic element and an abstracted temporal element.  The turn order mechanism is truly unique and adds plenty of tension.  Lots of good stuff, especially for the $9 I spent on it (new! - thanks Tanga).  

Somehow, though, it doesn't quite fulfill its seeming  promise.  Why?  It all boils down to symmetry.  It's the kind of game that can ALMOST be played perfectly - that is, if every player plays correctly, you basically end up with the winner being determined by how well they played the turn order track and placed themselves for the final turn.  There is really no way to account for why you won or lost outside of the final turns - in a sense, you feel like you're playing a 2 hour game where all the decisions that really matter exist in a 5-10 minute span, but locating where that span is becomes impossible.  Basically, with 2 the game is too symmetrical - you are both racing along, one person completing one VP building, the other another, and it all boils down to who is best positioned to take that last VP building and thus win.  There's nothing wrong with that, per se, but it leaves the same taste in your mouth as 2 player PG or Scepter of Zavandor - at the end of the game, you know you won or lost based on some minute tactical misplay earlier in the game, which only becomes visible in the results at game's end as the grabbing of the last city/sentinel/building.  I want to love this game, and I still would say it is more fun than PG or SoZ, if simply because of the novelty of the mechanics, but so help me, it was hard for me to bring it to the table, so it got sold.

Holy cow, is this one ever hard to wrap your brain around straight out of the box.  It's very rare that it takes me half a game to figure out what the crap is going on in a game, but there is some unusual stuff going on here.

One oddity is that you don't actually stockpile resources in this game.  You simply place guys on spaces to indicate that you have a resource, and remove the guy when you use that resource.  The tricky part is that if a guy goes unused for a turn, he just ups and leaves!  So, you must plan very carefully exactly when you'll need each resource, or risk losing them altogether!

Overall, the game is a nasty logistical exercise with a lot of player interaction, as you can block other players as well as dictate how often you (and thus your opponents) get a turn!  I'm pretty sure my rating would go up with more play... the first play is just really a bear until you understand how the game works.

Updated 5/13/10.  

I'm not entirely sure what to think of Neuland just yet.  I've managed 3 plays so far (all with the first-edition rules), and while I've won two of the three, I don't think I'm particularly good at the game just yet.  

The pros: The 2nd edition game components are quite nice.  I'm not sure I'm a fan of the parallelogram buildings, but I find the iconography intuitive, the chit quality solid, and the artwork attractive.  The gameplay is (largely) intuitive, and the depth of strategy is apparent, even if effecting the strategy is still quite hard.  Neuland is also unique, at least in my collection, as a logistics game, which means that it is likely to get played more often than if it were merely yet-another worker placement game.  

The cons: If I'm thinking about the game correctly (and I'm not sure I am), it seems that the crux of the game is (1) constructing production buildings in the ideal location; and (2) blocking/occupying critical buildings at opportune moments.  These are, of course, in addition to the core gameplay of resource conversion.  But if everyone is competent at the resource conversion bit, these two strategy aspects will really determine the winner (and potentially make the game great).  I can imagine this level of interaction (a.k.a. screwage) would be a big turnoff to many players.  More disconcertingly, I can imagine some players in my own game group being oblivious to these aspects of the game.  If the game is played as multi-player solitaire, there may not be much that is interesting left in the game.

[u]January 2010:[/u] bought in december for stimulating 2p game "à la" Caylus. The new rulebook is disastrous like anything I've seen before, I couldn't even understand anything in it (the Tomb, Caylus or Stronghold rulebooks are crystal clear compared to this one).
I played once and it seems like it will fit the bill as a good brainer and optimization type of game. We played with the 1st ed. rule which seem better, specially with the fact that players can choose the minerals in mines.

After a second play, I am disappointed with this one. You end up blocking your buildings all the time and that limits the interaction. I guess this would be mitigated with mor eplayers but as a 2p game, this felt flat for us. It just seems there are so many better games out now...

From my 9/09 session:
Now that my brain is no longer glowing white-hot, I’ll take a moment to write up the session report for our game last night. This was Michael’s and my second game and Chris’ first. We were playing first edition rules on the Z-Man board. When Michael and I first played, it was with one other newbie. We had no sense of how to the game would unfold, and, as it turned out, we sprinted up the tech tree, ran out of gas, lost some dudes, regrouped, built more food-makers, learned to protect our food like a mama-bear protects her young, and worked a bit more methodically toward the VP-makers. With this knowledge, we played this second game VERY differently.

We started out building very densely (with everyone building a second food-maker early) and trying to protect everything we built. That was the lesson learned, right? But of course, with the number of actions available, the long climb up the tech tree, and the dying off of the sleeping dudes, there is no choice but to leave buildings open. Still, protect your darned food! Eventually, dudes were crisscrossing the board, going every which way. Here was my ah-ha moment: Determining which buildings your opponents DON’T need so that you can leave them open is where the game is. Lesson #1.

I got out to an early lead picking up a 1VP and a 2VP building. Michael was on my heals with 2VP. Chris was slow out of the gate, but quickly ramped up. We stayed pretty close together all game, leapfrogging over each other as people vacated the high-level buildings to use them as inputs for the VPs, leaving them for others to get that next, higher VP.

Then my first misfortune happened (i.e. my first big screw-up): I realized that I needed 4VP to win and there was only one building that fit the bill – the sword/food/rug building. I targeted it, swiped the sword (which Chris needed to get his final 3VP btw), got on some food and a rock (to build the building) and ran out of actions. But I felt good. All I needed was the rug. And no one needed a rug, right? The wool-makers were open and should stay that way, right? Freakin’ idiot. In comes Chris, takes both wool-makers and makes my sword worth nothing. Zip. Nada. I could hear the sucking sound as all those accumulated actions were whisked off into the void.

Lesson #2: Lesson #1 was totally wrong. The game is not in knowing what your opponents won’t need, it’s in protecting yourself from the pillaging of your mean-spirited neighbors. If you need something REAL BAD, your opponents will throw themselves on the bomb. This ain’t no multi-player solitaire. This is screwage, but big-time.

Then came my second misfortune. And this one, I can at least blame partly on the game. Now that I had been effectively knocked out of the win, I was trying to get second. But the only VP building left was too much for me on my next turn. So, I ran out of gas. Then, in steps Michael and TAKES A 3VP BUILDING THAT IS ALREADY ON THE BOARD! Now, how did that get there? More importantly: how did I not see it? Here is where I scream, “The information design in this edition is total B.S.!” Yes, I should have known it was there, but come on people: the game end board with all the tiles down in the new edition is just a big technicolor blur. So, there went second. Chris got his final VPs. Game over.

So here is my take: The game is fiddly, but with a payoff if you are into brain-melting logistics games with the complex dynamic of other players trying to achieve similar ends using the same resource set. Think Age of Steam. These are, in fact, not my favorite kind of games. I call them ‘competitive logistics’ games. They are truly interactive and in no way MPS. But they don’t jazz me the way a good shareholding game will. I prefer games where manipulating situations and incentives is the focus, not planning complex operations (regardless of the abundant opportunities for screwage). That said, this is a good game. Even a really good game. But I’ve got to say, it needs a redesign. I mean, really, what were they thinking trying to make this more appealing to a broader audience through the artwork. The subtitle says it all: “Produce. Transport. Optimize.” That doesn't sound like a game for a broad audience. (I think my wife even laughed at me when she saw that.) The graphics need to be spartan (I hear they were in the first edition). Some ideas:

-The building display should have brown or grey backgrounds depending on the resource type needed to construct. This would allow the tiles to lie the other way round so that players could see the input/output of the building itself.
-The tiles should have a border color that corresponds to the appropriate terrain. Within that, divide the tile background to two contrasting colors so that the input is always on one background, the output on the other.
-Simplify the input/output icons. They are just too darned busy.
-Eliminate all unnecessary graphic clutter (e.g. all the shading an whatnot on the tiles)
-Put a border color around each item on the player aid so that players know what terrain type the different VP buildings go on.

RATING: 9
Excellently brain melty.  The decision tree is unusually bushy unusually quickly, and with four players this can make the game feel very tactical.  However familiarity with the game and the dependency relationships does a lot to swing the balance back the other way.  I suspect that three players may ultimately be the sweet spot with two players also being very good.  This is not to say that the four player isn't very good, just that it may be better for more experienced players and thus not be the best introductory player count.  There's also minor concern with four players that the VP allocations may be so lumpy as to make the end game less interesting.  

Update: Wonderful with three, suffers lockup problems with four without expert players, two players can degrade without exquisite care.

Warning: The second edition is a considerably weaker and more milquetoast game.  If that's all you can get, play it by the first edition rules.

RATING: 6
I sort of was hoping for Roads & Boats light.  Well, it's not that, but it is a pretty enjoyable tactical game of optimizing resources.  There's certainly some screwing over of your opponents going on here as well.  I have a feeling it could be prone to some serious analysis paralysis.

RATING: 7
Maybe the hardest game I've ever played. This is a very good thing. Intellectually exhausting, which is also a good thing but more intense than I tend to look for.

I own the Z-Man edition which, like Agricola, has lovely illustrations but poor interface design. There are clarity problems, and the tiles, boards, and player aids aren't nearly as well-designed as they should be for a game of this difficulty. From what I can see, the first edition isn't much, if any, better.

The Z-Man art is hysterically inappropriate. Neuland is a serious, aggressive logistics game for adults. The artwork totally achieves so-wrong-it's-right status, cartoony illustrations, bright colors, and adorable 'worker' pawns who appear to be wearing dresses. It genuinely looks like a children's game, which is kind of great.

For the love of God, play with the original rules: Instead of pulling mine pieces from a bag, just select the ones you want. Don't use the free food, free wood, free transport tokens. Add a rule that for a cost of 3 time units, you can place a pawn on any free resource that takes food as an input.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Neuland takes my favorite parts of Roads and Boats (the blocking, the supply chain anxieties, the shared ownership) and collapses them into a game that may be both better and shorter than its older brother.  

If you like R&B, this game is not to be missed.

I was looking for a logistics game and found this one.  Brain melting decisions, especially when you try to run multiple logistics trains at once.  I really like the mechanic that your goods only last for one round.  It allows for some very evil blocking of locations that do nothing but waste actions.  I have decided this is one of the few games I enjoy that is more strategy than tactics.

The game can devolve a little bit into a block-fest at the end of the game, and we agree with the consensus here... play by the first edition rules regarding mines.

RATING: 10
This one blew me away... It has been sitting on the shelf for 3y, and finally I decided to give it a thorough try. After a few games, it went straight up to 10, it's that good. Logistics heaven bar none. If you are serious about Euros, and love pick up and deliver with a bit of active interaction (read: confrontation and cursing) among players, you have to play this. Just make sure you play with the 1st edition rules, otherwise it's not worth it. @Eggertspiele, please give this one a deluxe treatment!

+ Exceptional time-based turn mechanism
+ Exceptional resource depletion mechanism
+ Exceptional money-less resource conversion mechanism (not fiddly at all)
+ Very tight, well balanced and choke-full of decisions
+ High replayability due to the variable tile setup 
+ Can be taught easily and played in 2h
+ Strangely thematic, for what it is

+ Highly confrontational, but with a real sense of purpose
= No cheesy catch-up mechanisms, if you fall behind you will probably lose
= Plays very well with 2 and is best with 3  
= Requires a handful of plays or good tutoring to get the cadence of the game

- The endgame can lock up with 4 players, so don't play it with 4
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Ugh.  Played with the original advanced rules with both 3p and 4p.  With 3p it was a tolerably good game of logistical networks that overstayed its welcome a little bit. With 4p we literally broke the game. We played into a deadlock where no player could obtain any further VP buildings (unless the other players colluded to allow it). Stalemate.

The updated Z-Man rules (which reportedly made the game worse according to my geekbuddy comments) would have prevented that situation, but I think would also have made the game a lot more arbitrary and less interesting to me.

Bottom line, I sold it and would have not been too upset to simply dump it in the trash. A reprint like that shouldn't have problems like that. And no, we played correctly absolutely. I thought certainly we'd missed some rule or something, but numerous rereads have confirmed that we played correctly.

Please polish your design before you sell it to me.

(Original Rules Only)

A timing and logistics game that feels somewhat like stripped down Roads & Boats, in a roundabout way. Neuland is an action point game where the number of points you have is dictated by a time track that surrounds the board with 10 spaces on it. Each player has a marker on it, and there is also an orange marker designating the present. When your turn comes up, you can use as many or as few action points as you like, as long as you don't land on or pass the time marker again. Your time is spent placing workers who produce resources which can be used to make buildings which make yet more resources which are then turned into VP producing buildings which win you the game.

The core concept in this is logistics: you decide on a goal, and then you chain moves together to make that come to fruition. This is where it reminds me of R&B. In terms of fiddle and fussyness, this game is much, much better though, and the amount of player interaction it encourages is excellent, particularly because this interaction doesn't slow the game down all that much. Blocking plays seem to be the key to more advanced level play, and one always has to be on the lookout to see what VP buildings the other players are gunning for.

If I have an early beef it's the learning curve, but any game like this is going to have one. There are scads of buildings, and to play the game, it helps to know how X transmutes into Y so that you can produce VPs. Other than that, I think this is one of the better games of its type. I'm not wildly crazy about it, but it's unique and I can see getting a number of plays out of this. It also seems like it's the kind of game that could gain with repeat play.

Neuland, and games like it are interesting to me. I think Van referred to this as a "spreadsheet" type game when we were playing it, and I can understand the thinking process, but I tend to disagree with its negative connotation. I think of Neuland as a logical or math problem. You need to carefully think through a chain of moves that will take you to your goal and then make it happen. I think games like this give me the same sort of satisfaction I can get out of pulling off the solution to a difficult math problem, but in a more fun environment. In that very indirect way, I think Neuland scratches the sort of itch that Princes of Florence and other more strategic Euros do for me. In many ways, this game is quite tactical, but it also has that strategic element as well.

Aside: I've only played this using the original rules and I have no real desire to play with the various crap added to the game in the new edition, particularly the random mines and the cheesy "You got blocked but here's an out" chips which seem like they would dilute the game down. Visually, the new edition seems like it should be easier to play with though, because the iconography is quite clear, so I still suggest getting a new edition, just be sure to download the file here that shows you how to play it with the original rules and you'll be set.

Ultimately, the game never really came back to the table. No one else I knew was interested in playing it, and the game system seems to really require repeated play to get up to its full potential.

This has the potential to be a 7.5 game, but for two things:
The rules are awful and there is way too much visual clutter.
By the time the board is nearly full, it's very difficult to make
out what's where.  They should have really cut down the 
cutesy graphics and just stuck with the utilitarian stuff.

A pretty intense game for something so thinky.  I think Neuland is a prime example of a good game that isn't much fun.  The production chain system is very cool and the action point system is genius but it's much too abstract for a civilization building game- it has virtually no flavor whatsoever.  The minimalist graphic design doesn't help.

I haven't played the old edition, but the new edition looks really nice. I can see what people like about this, but it's not really my kind of game. I don't really mind the kind of development games where you make a to get b to get c, etc, but in this one there is a very limited number of things to get with the end-of-the-line goods (e.g. a sword). And the things that can be built with it are fixed in a strict order. So what someone builds (or even doesn't build if you're planning on them building something) can completely screw you up. In this game you get a number of actions (well actually, you choose the number) to move your meeples around, but it's hard (for newbies at elast) to see the actions required to do something, which results in a lot of do and undo. BTW, this is a zero-luck game, and no variable setup, so it falls into that category of games that get "solved" and take the fun out of it for me. I have no problem with those who claim this is a great game, however. Just not one I would clamor to play. Having said that, however, this has the absolutely best mechanic for determining action points. I expect (and hope for) it to be brazenly stolen for future action point games.

[-]Need to play this again. Wow.[/-] As a note, it seems one should always save a food for the next turn. Always.

Aestethically it feels like playing Agricola Catanarum, thankfully this does not actually have anything to do with game mechanics.

EDIT: Internet claims playable with first edition rules only, this may or may not be true, but the first edition rules are certainly superior.

EDIT: End game drags down the rating a bit.

RATING: 5
I'm a little saddened in Neuland after the first initial skirmishes, to be honest. There is certainly potential there: it's a resource converter with spatial awareness, so that not only do you have to decide how and what you are going to convert goods into, ultimately, VP; but also [i]where[/i] because separated production locations cost more the further they are apart. Perfectly fine mechanisms almost extinct in 2014 (which is when I write this comment). Yes, the game is much older than that, but still.

The problem(s) as I see it(them) are as follows: first, the game does not know about user-controlled efficiency, so that you can invest in a particular layout as to make future pass-throughs take less time. All conversion steps take exactly the same amount of time; the number of resources required just goes up, lenghtening the production chain without there being anything in return... just more opportunities to block each other. Second is that the game has a strong tendency to end in a nigh photo-finish. It's probably doing that by design, but frankly to be spending a good deal of minutes to convert until you see blue in the face, and having them come down to someone being able to grab a crucial resource one turn earlier than an opponent can... that's too narrow, and uninteresting. It is nigh impossible to tell why someone won, and not someone else; the lack of such feedback means that skill improvement is very difficult. Final issue is that there seems to be very little tactical trickery available. Players very quickly learn to manipulate the time track in their favour so that they can perform a 'double action'; they also quickly learn to spend a few time units on occupation of key resources prior to calling their turn quits. That gets old really quickly.

Had either issue not existed, then Neuland would have been a much more interesting game. Currently I'm not inclined to continue experimentation beyond the first few trial games although a few opponents have expressed an interest in doing so. I'll oblige them, but not with much enthusiasm. I believe that the game in which these problems do not exist is called 'Roads & Boats' (give or take a few differences...) so I've dutifully scheduled a trial attempt of that Splotter game. In the meantime, I'm stuck with Neuland. 

If you are planning to play this game (using the 2nd Ed. box): stick to 3 players (you have been warned), and use the 1st Ed. rules with mines resources arriving by choice and not at random. Add the Alchemist's Tent from the 2nd Ed. rules, this will help the endgame a little. Finally make sure that the time track is the [i]long[/i] one—this goes against the rules as written which contain an error in this regard.

[b]Update[/b] Let the game go.

Production: Sturdy components, but poor art design: the iconography and color scheme became a squiggly blur for my eyes, and the production trees on the tiles are obscured by the presence of pawns.  Overall, I found that the design interfered with my playing of the game.  Play: Not my type of strategy game.  I can see that players could enjoy this, with all the careful planning of one's production line, and creating efficient paths toward certain goods.  However, this felt like a mathematics word problem: it was a challenge to find my best move for a turn, but it wasn't enjoyable.  This isn't a bad game in itself, but it is a bad game for me.  I didn't have a single moment of fun playing it (from the game, anyway; my companions were quite fun).  (1+0+0) (1 play)

RATING: 7
This very unique game takes a while to get the hang of. Neither the resources nor the worker placement mechanic are handled in the typical fashion. Your "workers" really represent the presence of a particular resource at a certain point in a chain of production. The game is in the timing of these chains. (Resource chains that are not advanced during your turn are lost. You cannot sit on your coal for 3 turns waiting for your chance to build the next building. Use your coal or lose it.)

All of this makes for a very serious brain-burning experience... but a good one!

One complaint is that the great artwork actually gets in the way at times... too much visual clutter, especially toward the end of the game. If I'm still really liking this game after a few more plays, I may make some graphically simpler tiles.

Edit: Forgot my biggest complaint... the Z-Man edition rulebook may be the single worst rulebook in my entire collection. Download the rulebook alternatives and summaries from BGG and go from them. (Also, don't use the little "tweaks" that Z-Man added to make the game less difficult: the wheelbarrow and the free wood tokens, the ability to automatically refill a mine, etc. Use the Edition 1 rules.)

Interesting. No-luck complete information logistics game where you
 spend action points to get raw materials or to move them around
 or to use them to make more sophisticated products. The more 
 sophisticated products are used either to build processing 
 buildings (which you control only temporarily) or as raw materials to make even more sophisticated
 products. The most sophisticated products are worth VP.

Cool mechanic with the action points and "turn order".

I see the rating dropping as the analysis paralysis kicks in. Was not a problem the first game as we were somewhat working together on all our moves, but a slow player would be frustrating here.

Interested in trying it for 2.

An excellent perfect information game of building and economic optimizing, timing and logistics. There are tons of possible options on almost every turn, so the games are pretty different from one another.

Brain burner.  More of a puzzle than a game really.  You have to take X resource, convert it into Y, then convert it into Z, then into VPs.  You are allotted Action Points to do this.  The problem with games like this is that they are prone to a lot of analysis.  In this game, you really don't want to take a lot of actions unless you reach the ultimate goal of VPs.  So you have to spend some time calculating the APs it will take to get VPs.  The downtime is probably too much to play it with 4, but it is fine as a 3er game.

Players race to develop a land, trying to be the first to use up all their prestige chips.  Interesting game where players spend action points to produce resources, and deliver them to sites that require them to produce something else.  Logistical chains are set up ... produce food, deliver to woodcutter to get wood, use wood to build mine, etc.  Prestige chips are at the end of the chain.  Nice looking (Z-man) game, plays quickly once you "get it", rules are straightforward.  Like it.

Érdekes, jó mechanikájú játék. Nagyon jól összerakva. Elhúzódhat, de érdekes marad, bár vége felé nagyjából látható kinek van esélye a győzelemre. Komoly előre tervezést igényel, és elsőre szokatlanul nehezen átlátható. Ugyanakkor valszeg 2-3 játék után ez az átláthatatlanság csökken. De ez egyértelműen gémerjáték.

I'm really satisfied with this one.  I see what people are saying regarding the high down time, and they're correct, but I like the rest of the mechanics and play so much it doesn't lower my rating too much.  We'll see if I still feel that way after several plays.

Bumping up the rating after another play.  Still pretty much always want to play this.

Had to allow extra time to get up the learning curve on this one, though once that happens it is a relatively straightforward game. 

There's example play in the instruction manual, but it is abbreviated and cuts illustration of key points too short (such as what happens to your marker after you've used a resource - does it move to the next building?, or how you know whether the resource generated has been used). The illustration on how to count movement actions raised more Qs than it answered.  We liked the idea of this game so spent a *lot* of time trying to clarify a few key points. Reviewing user-posted content on BGG resolved some of those questions: 

+ workers on a hex represent the respective good output by that building. If there is a worker present, then the output is available.
+ to erect a new building, pay with resources by removing the relevant workers and returning them to the player's supply (paying also with actions on the time track based on the resource which is the furthest away - distance less 1). A worker is not placed on the building when it is built.  Getting a worker to the building follows from spending the input resources (and removing a worker or several workers and returning them to supply) and placing a 'new' worker on the building.
+ resources not used in a particular turn are indicated by workers that remain at the end of a turn.  Those resources must either be used during the next turn or they are lost. (Laying the worker down indicates which resources must be used or lost on the next turn.)

It also takes time to figure out how to count actions -- for example with coats of arms: pay to build, pay to produce, add any distance action costs for each step. It seems as if you pay an action to get there, and then just remove a worker for no action cost and place coats of arms.  Not clear.

During our first game, one of the players got locked out after ending a turn without a piece on woodcutter's hut.  (Although the manual recommends against this, it does not indicate how to resolve.) it appeared that no other players could go until that player took another turn, however that player could not do anything -- being locked in a position with no opportunities to either build or get resources to take any actions.  We had to abort and unwind actions to allow that player to amend actions. By this time we really focused to try and keep playing.


It's a race to generate resources to get increasingly more valuable ones that enable claiming points whilst potentially blocking others from doing the same along the way.


Update: could see many other people had issues with the instructions.  A clear walk through of key actions, with how each affects action count, would be helpful. (Pics in the manual are too small, and have too many steps combined in one photo.   
"Erecting Abbey - no action"
"Placement of coats of arms costs products and actions according to the same rules" (not clear)

Probably one of the worst rule books of the several thousand I've read so far.

Quite a long game, we had to stop halfway as we ran out of time, but also we struggled to understand the rules as written. We nearly abandoned until reading the example made sense of what was happening. but we still got stuff wrong, so it was more of an experiment. Still, a hell of logistical exercise. As we went on, it became more interesting, and I can see now why you might want to hang back and wait for others to build first. Camping on production became important, and really impeded following players. Efficiency of location also mattered, as pulling in production from a distance cost extra actions. We need to check the FAQ but it may well get a proper play.

First warning; don't play this game with the AP-prone.

Second warning; the rules as written in English are almost totally indecipherable; terms such as "giving up resources" when what is meant is "using resources" only add to the enigma.

Neuland is a game about logistics management; it's a very good game about logistics management because it cleverly includes a time element which determines who will move next based on how many actions they took in a prior turn.

It's a very thinky game, players having to work out exactly where and when they will need particular resources in order to score; it certainly isn't as easy as it looks.  Moving resources to where you want them costs actions and actions take time; if you run out of time then somebody else may step in and use the building you intended to.

For me personally, because of the AP issue, I'm going to have to be careful who I play it with.

Neuland is a logistics puzzler. It's also not a game for people prone to AP. The plethora of options available and the often lengthy resource chains required to produce processed goods require precise accounting and timing.

Unfortunately, towards the end of the game the number of sensible choices dwindles significantly, to the point where it becomes rather easy to completely block certain facilities and thereby create lock-ups with little that other players can do about it. It also seems like shortly before the end of the game everyone is just shy of winning and it really comes down to very minor positional advantages that rarely are the result of deliberate player actions. For a game this long, having only the last two turns count is not really a great thing in my mind.

The random seeding of mines should have no place in such a mathematical game but apparently that can be fixed by playing by 1st edition rules instead.

A game that requires a lot of thought.  You have a limited number of moves, at most 10 I believe, depending on how many moves behind you are (more behind means more moves), to erect a chain of buildings or moves that allow you to score points.  The dependencies are not intuitive, but can be learned fairly quickly.  The kicker is that all buildings are unowned, so if one of your moves is building a building, then that makes more possibilities open for your opponent.  Two additional complications: you can "claim" a building for a full round (all players) with one of your moves, and buildings require goods which cost moves to transport to other more advanced buildings.  This can make, or allow me to set up, a scoring move that costs me less actions...and that's the key to the game.  You're basically only doing two types of turns: scoring, or setting yourself up to score in such a way that your opponent can't use your same scoring idea.  Tricky game!

The action point mechanism is ingenious, but the game didn't grab me.  I just don't see a breadth of strategic choices.  All the players proceed down similar paths, and the key seems to be timing everything correctly.

This was a real outsider for me at Essen 2005. I loved it. It's a simpler kind of Roads & Boats, but better, with a unique action point mechanic. Some confusing about the rules during the first play, but with the correct rules it goes smoothly in about 1,5 hours.

NOTE! My rating is for the OLD version. The new version has a really nice graphic, but it is so cluttered so it's hardly playable. It lacked all intuitive recognition and the first and only played took 3,5 hours and the owner of the game even quitted the game. I'm also doubtful regarding the rules changes. This version will only be rated 5 or 6 and I'm happy with the original version. I must add that the old version was actually played by me a week earlier.

Very thinky game. There are a number of similarities to Roads and Boats from the logistics perspective. The turn order time track (just like Red November) adds an interesting twist. 

My main concern is that, for such a brain-burner, you can do very little planning ahead of time. You will usually need to base your plans on what buildings are available at the start of your turn, so the b egining of each turn is a sit and think stage. Not bad with 2 or 3, but this could make the game drag quite a bit if you played with 4.

Neuland no es un juego, es un organigrama. No hay que tomar decisiones, vasta con seguir un guión o un organigrama para ir consiguiendo los puntos de victoria.

Si aun así deseas probarlo hazlo con reglas de la primera edición.

Sufre de sobre análisis y tiempos muertos mientras la gente piensa en todos los pasos que debe seguir para alcanzar los puntos de victoria, pero como digo al inicio de mi comentario me parece que con un organigrama puedes jugar sin tomar una sola decisión en el juego, recuerda mucho a algunos juegos de ordenador de gestión.

Pretty game on the surface but in reality its just a mess with confusing icons that are difficult to read unless you're standing right over the board. Z-Man should be ashamed of publishing a game with such bad rules - so bad that consumer protection laws should be called in to give them an ass wooping!  Someone will need to convince me this is worth the experience before I'll entertain playing again;  I intensly dislike the action point system which is a downtime nightmare. The over thinking required to manage abstracted resources is not worth the mental effort.  I really can't see an ouch of fun in this game.  If dross needed a definition, this game would be it.

RATING: 5.5
Played about half a game once (but ran out of time).  It gets confusing fast, because the number of actions you have is not fixed each turn -- it depends on how many actions your opponent(s) took.  In a 2-player game, you will always be allowed at least 10 actions, but you could get as many as 18 actions before your opponent goes, which can change the game dramatically!  It's kind of a game of leapfrog.

Clogging the free resources is important -- if you put a worker on basic resources (food, wood, stone) at the end of your turn, then other players won't be able to do much on their turns.  But if you deploy too many workers, then they'll lie down at the beginning of your turn, and you may need too many actions to use them all up -- you'll lose them.

I think this game would be much better if computer-aided.  It would allow you to ask, "I want to buy this VP building; how many actions will that take?", and the answer would help you to plan more effectively.

The rules suck -- they are very badly organized.  I learned better from a 4-page summary posted on BGG than from the actual rules.  Even then, there are some rules that I wasn't clear about.  For example, what can the gold (output of the alchemist) do for you?  It can apparently be used for any one resource, but can that be an advanced resource like tools, swords, and coins?  What about the wheelbarrow -- can that really supply *all* the resources for a VP building for free, even the advanced resources?

I'm going to cut strait to the chase: this is a phenomenal resource-conversion game. Now resource conversion games often end up being a simple equation of either having the resources and having the means to convert them (either into points, money, or improved resources) but it is rarely the case that games offer you robust ways of interfering with and in the conversion process itself. This is that type of game.

Directly tied to the resource conversion is a layer of heavy logistics: where will you get the resource from? How will you get it to its next location? What infrastructure do you need to get to producing end-buildings? What buildings does your opponent *need* that you could occupy? Every action takes "time", whether building or producing. You can take as many actions as you want so long as you don't overshoot the present time (this might mean having up-to 10 'hours' to plan for your workers). Whoever has planned their workers to end their shift the soonest gets to schedule their labour next. This produces a beautiful sequencing mechanism in which you can take long turns, short turns, and some times, two turns in a row to make a huge turn (this usually entails coming short time-wise of whoever is next, then starting your next turn immediately as you would still be the 'next to plan'). Bring in the fact that buildings are single occupancy (read: BLOCKING) and that your ressources don't hold out indefinitely (so blocking can and does have serious impacts), this game becomes a vicious brain-burner.

Also, to quote NateStraight: [q="NateStraight"] It's the single closest game in style to Roads & Boats, but is built for those who don't like optimization.[/q]

A game fundamentally mired in contradiction. Supposedly a deep thinking brain burner, this game is so chaotic that anything more than superficial thinking is completely futile. Near eternal downtime, you could play another short game while waiting for your turn to come around. Nothing you build belongs to you, so on your turn you don't want to do anything, but you do because the rules say you must. Given the pretence in the concept, this is one of the poorest German games I've played.

I'd had this described to me as Roads & Boats light, and this is pretty accurate.  It's all about using space efficiently to build up what you need in the tech tree.  This is a very appealing type of game to me, and Neuland does it in about two hours while still being rich and interesting.  Good stuff.  Rulebook is poor.  The board gets very very crowded with the full complement of four players. (2 plays)

Yes, we played with the "good" rules.  You got to fill the mines yourself and they disappeared after being emptied.

Really though, this just wasn't fun.  We played a 2-player game and made sure to move swiftly.  And yet it still took almost 2 hours.

The beginning was actually the most interesting.  You could almost own a portion of the board at the end of your turn.  It allowed for some planning.

I think that was my biggest beef.  The only real long term planning was where to build the buildings.  Since you couldn't "own" them all, nor even occupy them all after awhile, then the actual production portion of the game was very tactical.

Most turns just went "Make Food, Make Wood, Make Food, Make Stone..."  I love me some economic Euro games, but this was just drab.  Give me Puerto Rico any day.

I love brain-burning, complex Euros. I love squeezing as much information as possible into my head while I try to work out the best thing to do next. But there has to be some reward to the process so that after pulling off the move you have some level of satisfaction and maybe the feeling that you're more clever than you thought. In this game, however, it's just a chore. You have to process long chains of information in your head just to do the most mundane move possible. And because the game features an annoying amount of blocking, chances are that you'll spend the 5-10 minutes between turns trying to work out all the steps to your move, only to have it blocked anyway, leaving you to have to sit and work out some other boring, uninteresting move that still requires the same amount of work (or maybe more to get around the blocking in the first place).

I found there to be tremendous down time in this game.  Other players used the down time to work on their next move, I found that too much changed between moves for me to make such calculations.  I had the benefit of all of the web's collective wisdom about the rules, so I think we played a correct game.  In any case the mechanism works fine, but technology tree production works so much better and effortlessly in a variety of computer games, I am not sure anyone should bother trying to port it to a board game.  Most annoyingly, the graphics in the game are so spartan, there are insufficient visual clues.  So a large part of the down time in the game comes from trying to figure out where the necessary pieces are located on the board.  At two and a half hours, there are a lot better ways to spend your time.

Like it says on the box, "Producing. Transporting. Optimizing." If those three words don't get your juices flowing, then I don't want to know you.

The downtime takes away from an otherwise delightful experience. It's hard to plan turns in advance unless you spend each turn strongly setting up the next one, which is easier said than done (it's also not an obviously dominant strategy).

Eggert-Spiele: Excellent resource management game, very insightful mechanics, especially the turn action/order track which seems like a fresh concept. Easily the ugliest game I've seen in quite a long time...maybe ever.  I can imagine this would get picked up by a bigger company, paste some nice graphis on it and re-release the game.

Z-Man: I like the graphics, they are an obvious improvement over the original game.  The game has been slightly tweaked and I'm fine with that since I've only played the original version once. Still a great game.  However, it's been beat to death but the rules are really horrible.  I couldn't figure out the distance rule without help and the Alchemist was really explained. That being said, you should try this game if you enjoy building games like Roads & Boats or Phoenicia.

Place workers on the tiles to claim resources, then use the resources to build more tiles that make better resources, that you can place workers on, and so on until you start to get the tiles that give you victory tokens.  It has an action track like Thebes that lets the player in last place on the track go next and use as many actions as they want (limited by the size of the track), but the farther ahead they are on the track, the longer it is before they get another turn.

It was 2-1/2 years between my first play and my second, so I basically had to relearn the game.  And the others at the table hadn't played before.  Learning from the rules was a nightmare.  I remember it being much easier to learn the first time when there was someone there who was familiar with the game.

It's a decent game with some cool mechanisms for collecting and using goods, but perhaps not worth the time investment.  And if I don't invest the time, the tricks I learned will fade away again.

RATING: 7
Interesting blend of mechanics. An action point system... however if you use less you may actually be able to use more than the 10 AP's depending on how many the players before you used.  Turn order is also variable due to this mechanic.

It is a bit of a brain burner, at least playing the 1st time.

******************
Just played the new editon for the 1st time, 2+ years after having played the 1st time.  I think I like the plain landscapes of the original better... but some of the graphic aids are better.  Wish my player aid for the special (victory point) buildings was double sided with an aid for the regular buildings on the other side (it's hard to see the graphics on the board the tiles are stacked on because the tiles themselves are in the way).

I've played with three and two.  Both games were good.  Player turn order can be manipulated to your advantage by taking few actions one turn, going next to get just the building you may be afraid may be no longer available.  Food to Wood, wood for buildings, and that sort of thing.  It's thinky but in a good way.

A very deep game, serious brainburner.  I think I'd rather play Roads and Boats, which has similarities with this game, but this hits the same spot in a 90-120 minute time frame.

Three months after my first play, I'm realizing that I don't really want to play Neuland again, and wondering why that is.  Paradoxically I'll probably only discover why I didn't want to play again -- by playing again.

Scored for the first edition rules, which we played with the attractive 2nd edition game. Some of those 2nd edition rules are just baffling in their utter lameness. BUT, played with the streamlined elegance of the original, this game really stands out. The game is extremely interactive as you compete with other players for the use of buildings and attempt to block them from what they need. You can even use the turn mechanism to take less actions in order to screw your opponents out of a few precious actions as well, or get in before them on the following turn. If you like efficiency games, I don't see how you couldn't love this one. Just make sure you play it right!

It's hard to escape the fact that this is a dry game.  You need to produce certain end-goods for increasing VP's.  Producing those involves producing intermediary goods along a production chain.  The central mechanic involves creating and using buildings which move your goods along the production chain - and counting the steps it takes to do so most efficiently.  At times it feels more like a Richochet Robot puzzle than an economic game.

Neuland is a game of logistics similar to Roads & Boats. As in Roads & Boats, the parts of the logistic chain don't belong to the player building them and can be used by anybody once the original owner has to vacate them. Setting up the chains and utilizing them to place the victory points is challenging and very enjoyeable when it's your turn. Here comes the big problem. With the full complement of four players it can - and will sometimes - take 10-15 minutes until it's your turn again. Up to 9 actions can be taken with plenty of opportunities available. A misconception of a production cycle will cost dearly without a catch-up mechanism provided. The only chance for recovery are other players faults. Therefore, competitive players will take a long time to thoroughly plan their moves. 
Neuland is refreshingly different from typical eurogames but at the same time it reveals all potential weaknesses of action-point driven games. I'm torn on rating this. There's certainly a good game here but the downtime will keep this from getting regular play. Niche game.
A final remark on the new vs. old rules: we played with the new rules. I read up afterwards on the old rules but I don't think that the new rules are as terrible as BGG common opinion states. Too much fuss about a bit of randomness injected.

Reading from the rulebook was like reading from the Necronomicon. While I understood the word forms I was speaking, their meaning alluded me until I glanced up and noticed I had somehow cast a spell from it and turned my gaming buddies to stone.

I felt really guilty at this point, and started scanning the example pages in hopes of finding a counter spell or something. After a lot of work and head scratching, I was able to reverse the process and we all discovered that Neuland wasn't to be feared after all. Hidden behind the horribly written instructions which must have been translated from Arabic into Old English is a very fun engine building game.

If you like games with no luck and that allow you to plan and compete for resources to build an engine that will allow you to build the victory buildings, then check this game out. Don't let the rules scare you off!

Based on 2 plays.  The downtime is pretty bad on this one.  The game punishes people for sitting on resources without using them, but this puts pressure on players to ensure that they do not build expensive products without a market for them and slows down play.  I enjoyed one of my games much more because it was with good friends, so we could carry on other conversations while the active player was calculating.

Rating only applies to the first edition rules. So far convinced with 2-3 player games, with 4 seems to suffer overly from the kind of player induced chaos, where player A successfully blocks B and C, accidentally causing D to win. A bit on the dry side as you're constantly calculating the actions you have left, but I suspect the rating to go up with further plays. Lots of brutal blocking, and a very clever time track that you need to successfully manipulate to gain the edge.

The real downside is I can't seem to get anyone to play this with me.

I'm not a huge fan of the rule set which seems a bit vague in some places.  It is definitely a brainburner of a game as you scheme to set yourself up for scoring the victory point buildings.  I played mostly with the original rule set using Z-man's version of the game.  I can definitely see where lock up could occur late in the game.  Roads & Boats may take longer, but I prefer that over this one.

RATING: 7
Yes!  One play and my preliminary rating is higher than I usually give a game after only one go.  We played our first 3-player game almost as a collaborative competition, each player discussing possible moves and production chains on the other's moves, advising and debating possible turns.  This was fine because we were all trying to understand the game's system and challenges together.  Further games will be played in cutthroat, silent contemplation.

The Z-man edition does a nice job, graphically, of keeping everything clear and readable.  I CANNOT imagine playing the original Eggert-Spiele edition, where everything is black ink on green wood.  I'm so color-oriented that my mind would explode trying to contemplate that.

That said, we played by the original Eggert rules.  Perfect control over the mines, no wheelbarrows or food markers or wood markers.  Alchemist's Cave seems fine to me to leave in, but for some reason it never got built in our game.

This is a wonderfully challenging puzzle-like game with lots of direct interaction and nastiness.  I look forward to playing this many times and exploring its depths.

A brain burner with ridiculously simple rules (once you understand meeples are not doing what they usually do). Funny how I took so long to debut it due to irrational fear.

[b]Update[/b]: I didn't enjoy it as much playing it with four. Which is understandable as there's no real scaling besides playing for less points - the buildings are the same no matter the player count, and with four it seems there is just too many turns on which you don't do anything and stuff expires. Let's see how well it plays with three (many people say it is the sweet spot it seems). With 2 it is excellent (but your head will hurt after finishing!).

I hesitated to buy this one because of some of the negative comments here.  I'm glad I took the chance!  Neuland is a fun, challenging and addicting game.  Simple rules (although somewhat unclear, especially the idea of "production area," which can be cleared up in the BGG forum) underly an amazingly clever system where logistics and timing are the central focus.  Works nicely with 2 players but better with 3.  Use the original German rules to make this especially interesting - there's a nice one-page download here that shows you how (the Z-Man rules, while fun, don't provide for as challenging an experience as the original rules).

Confusing rules. How about someone explain why Red in the rules sample (in *all* editions of the game) takes only 5 actions on their first turn? These rules are not a Zman problem per se: the rules suck in all versions.

Although it's from 2004, it seems more contemporary with the time track mechanism such as found in [b][thing=66362][/thing][/b] and the streamlined logistics that are reminiscent of [b][thing=111341][/thing][/b].  Unfortunately it has a few clunky parts; the seeding of the mines and the metal conversion tokens, for example.

Neuland is a very consistent and consequential design, but the resulting game, may not be the best.

First of all, it sets new records in down-time. It also seems totally chaotic on the first play, and has a very steep learning curve - but I need to play it more to know if that pays off in the end.
The graphics and development of the board during play, is confusing and unaestetic. The confusion lessens the more you play of course, but it makes it both hard and uninviting for new players.

The time/turn-mechanic is very interesting and useful - someone should copy it into a slightly more accessible game ;-)

My only game was with the new edition, and although there is some purely brilliant stuff here (especially turn structure and resource handling), I understand the sharp divide between those players who liked it and those who abhorred it: if treading a path through the labyrinth of resource and production buildings is a burden instead of a fun puzzle, it will inevitably poison the whole game for you.

And this in spite of a very good attempt at optimising the design - after having a glance at the first edition components, I'm pretty sure that those players who were disgruntled even when having to deal with the much improved graphics of 2nd Ed would have ripped my throat by round four if I had inflicted the drab 1st Ed on them.

Even though I liked it a lot, I can't help wondering whether it would by possible to jettison a quarter of the plethora of resources and still keep the charm of Neuland - unlike Cuba, the resourcivitis here is at least not completely unfounded, but it still adds some complexity and game duration that might have been cut down a bit.

Comments based on the Z-Man edition.

Brain... burning.  Eyes... BLEEDING!

The game is fascinating.  The components are eye-watering.  Individually, the tiles look quite nice.  By the end of the game, the board looks like a unicorn pooped rainbows on it.  The visual clutter obscures rather than enhances.

Thanks to Z-Man for reprinting it, but if it becomes a regular in my rotation I think I'm going to seek out the Eggert-Spiele edition for the easier-on-the-eyes components.

Also, if you are learning Neuland from the rules, do yourself a favor and pick up the rewritten 2nd edition rules by Jim Cote.  The rulebook included in the game reads like they just ran the German rules through Google Translate.  You will be left scratching your head.  Cote's rules make everything crystal clear.

I have played with 2 and 3 so far and prefer 3.  My opinion of the game improved on the second play and my opinion of the components and artwork fell even further.

Two of my opponents liked this game and one absolutely loathed it.  Mr. Loather is at most gaming sessions which means it doesn't get played as often as I'd like.  (We finally got Mr. Loather to play a second game.  He still hates it.)

The conversion chains are mind-numbing, you are always counting, "1,3,4,5,6... no wait, then I won't be able to do ..." but the how - how to win - that is the intriguing part. You are all doing the same conversions, but you can throw grit in their machinery, use "their" buildings or just build some of the limited buildings you both need so that they are closer to where you have control. All so that their count goes 1,2,5,7 to do what you can do in 1,2,3,4,6! I can see why some people won't enjoy this, I really can - but to me, this so very granular, "hairs-width" efficiency competition is both brutal and enjoyable (in the pull your hair, "f***** what should" I do kind of way, yes I'm weird).

I can see it being best with 3 like I've read on the forums - it certainly isn't at its best with 2, and 4 I think would drag on and on. So yeh, I'm not sure how often I'll get to play this but I like it and it's something I want to understand a lot better than I currently do.

Kinda hurts the brain a bit.  It's a race to build technologies but it really requires analysis because to earn the technology their are a ton of steps to take and players can try to lock you out of some of those opportunities which could potentially be extremely costly.  Quite the puzzle.  I enjoyed playing but this is one of those once or twice a year games.   Must say the turn-order / action point mechanism was the second best mechanic of the year right behind the brilliant rondelle in Antike.

Acquired in a math trade for New World: Carcassonne.

Wow. I printed up some player aids from BGG, then sat down to read the rules and do a dry run to learn the game. Extremely frustrating experience. It took a long while to set up, between arranging the hexes, building the frame around them, then sorting and stacking the buildings. I then tried to learn the game. I see the little tokens for Silver/Iron Ore, but where the fuck do I get coal from? Is that what comes out of the mines by default?

After about 10 minutes of trying to decipher the gameplay, I put everything away. I'll either try again another day, wait for someone who knows the game to teach me, trade it away or burn it and flush the ashes down the toilet.

This has been traded and is in a holding pattern.

Reacquired cheaply in trade a few years later. Gonna give it another go.

Starting to think that the universe does not want me to play this game.

Very interesting game, quite a brainburner. The turn order mechanism is remarkable. It looks pretty bad, but plays tight and nasty. I was lucky enough to find a new copy at Spiele-Offensive in January 2006 - who would've believed it?

Tentative rating after first play. 

This game is such a brain burner that I had to clean leaking cerebral spinal fluid out from my ears when I was done. I can understand the appeal, totally, it's about an hour and a half of stretching my brain like taffy. But I can also understand why Z-Man nerfed the original German rules when they reprinted it--it requires an entirely different kind of mental gymnastics to plan in the way the game requires planning, and at least a basic understanding of logistic principles, and I honestly cannot see this being a smash hit. Ergo, in the default rules provided with the Z-Man edition, you have this weird randomizing of mine resources, the three freebie tokens for food, wood, and transport, and that alchemist's cave, which (apparently) prevents endgame gridlock? But maybe it's a flaw to try dumbing it down for a wider audience. This is not a game for a wider audience. I am not even sure this is a game for me...

Indeed, while my mind was certainly well exercised, playing it was not necessarily an enjoyable experience. Maybe not my thing? Anyhow, I will definitely have to play it again and see.

Well, here's another resource conversion game I don't mind. I'm not sure why I find this less boring; perhaps it's that you're not hoarding cubes in front of you or that the focus isn't quite on the resources themselves but on the supply chains you need to create on your turn to score points. There's a little bit of screwage in this game too, so it's not completely multiplayer solitaire. The communal board evolves in an interesting way. Ultimately, I can imagine getting tired of this game, but for now I'm actually intrigued enough to want to play at least a couple more times.

Some "potentially" good mechanics coupled with good bits should equal a good to great game, right?  Not this time.

The learning curve on first play is huge, not because it is complex or heavy but purely because I found it counter-intuitive.
Once learned though ti is a good game. I think the downtime between moves with 4 players may well mean the game becomes too long and boring for players waiting for their turn. But with 2 or 3 players it should work well.

Update (2009/05/20) : Still like the game, but this is definitely not a game you want to casually bring out - the learning curve can be very steep, so you'll want a more understanding crowd.

I think the 2nd edition made a big mistake with the tiles and the boards. They could have specified the building cost on the board, which would allow the tiles to display their "functional" sides.

============================= 

Once you're past the somewhat counter-intuitive user-interface and the concept of resource ownership, you will find a great game. It definitely takes a couple of plays to feel comfortable with everything, but it's really worth it. I don't usually like tech-tree based resource management games (such as Phoenicia or Zeptor von Zavandor), but the coupling of the tech tree with unique turn order mechanism in this game really works for me.

Opaque rules, monstrous downtime, and a lingering question:  "Why are we playing this instead of Roads & Boats, which is longer but faster-paced and way more fun?"  

I've read about the rules changes made by Z-Man (apparently, it wasn't enough that they gave Neuland one of the ugliest box covers in all of gaming), and I don't doubt that it was a better game before their meddling, but I'm not interested in playing it again.  Life's too short.  In the interest of fairness, however, I won't give the game a numeric rating, since I didn't play by the original rules.

turn a to b than b to c and c to d, than c and d to e etc, with a spatial element, and a clever way to count the number of actions spent, that influences player order and timing. there are lots and lots of different possibilities and whoever can foresee them better will usually be the most efficient. there is some interaction on the board by taking away spaces from other players, but the game feels to me a somewhat lonely exercise in forward thinking and efficiency. Unfortunately therefore there is a ton of downtime, since the board changes a lot by the time it is your turn again and planning ahead of your turn is difficult, which for me diminishes the enjoyment. It is a bit chesslike in terms of forward thinking and perhaps in need of limiting the time allowed for each player. If you are not bothered by this, than it is recommended for three players.

RATING: 4
very unclear board / game elements; massive downtime (which I normally don't mind, but you can hardly plan ahead at all here), If you want to play well, you have not only to check your possibilities but the possibilities of all other players as well. (Does it make sense to work onto this or that or can anybody grab my work for his own uses ...) If everybody does so ... hours pass. 
The game is too much work and too little fun to me. Perhaps I'd liked it better 10 years ago...

RATING: 6
I liked turn-order / action point -system. Basic mechanics were simple but for some reason applying it in game was hard for me. I still enjoyed game even if I had no strategy and thinking tactics made my brain hurt. Game is probably best when played with 3 players. 

Update (29.6.2008): Tried another game this time with the new edition. I must mention that the new edition looks really good compared to the old one. The game still seems both very good and at the same time frustrating. Mechanically the game feels great and rules are simple enough but it's too hard to see how the production chains interact when playing. This even might have been improved in the new print but I still had troubles with it. Because of this counting what you can do with your actions is taking more time in Neuland than usually for me in similar games. That isn't really the fun part of the game. This might get easier if you play the game more and/or regularly but this is one of those games I cannot see myself being able to play very often. I'm not completely sure would I even want to.

Update (6.1.2013): You really should use 1st edition rules when playing. Can't remember what rules were used in my 2. game but after buying game cheap and reading rules for both : you definitely want to use 1st edition rules. At least for mines since otherwise you might be so royally screwed when building one. You really can't be sure what you get from mine with 2nd ed. rules.

RATING: 7
Hugely tactical beast where you need to target your next tech tree advance and work towards getting the goods required to build it before the others. Rules are non-intuitive. I suspect it's one of those games where the faster you get (the better you know the buildings), the slower you get, as you try and get an edge on the others. The expected downtime stops this getting to the table often. It worked surprisingly well as a 2 player, with the same planning and logistics challenge, but less chaos between turns and less downtime obviously. It's a game of spotting opportunity left by the previous player and taking advantage of it, and denying the next of easy wins on the next turn. Which leads us to ... Downtime.

Based on one play: I like the time mechanic where you decide how many actions you want to take each turn and then it moves tot he player who has played the least next This mechanic is now used in a lot of games, but I believe Neuland was one of the first. The problem is the actual game play. You move your meeples around to create goods but tracking thinks and the artwork are really bad. Your engine also never gets better so it gets very repetitive, starting over each time. This gets old fast and the game is long so repeating the same steps over and over is not fun.

The oft-used description of "Roads and Boats Lite" is actually really appropriate for this game.  You create buildings, but you don't own them--the only thing you really can own is the workers carrying the goods around the board.  Your objective is to go through a convoluted process of turning raw materials into points, with as few steps and as little travel as possible.  However, a points building can only be used once--so easy ways to get points will disappear quickly, forcing players to go through more and more elaborate hoops to turn stuff into points.  If you like logistical puzzles, this game really shines.

Interesting game. Not sure where I stand with it. The conversion was rather simple and much easier to comprehend than say Roads and Boats, but it started to bog down towards the end.

I was suspicious about this game after first playing Logistico... how could a logistics game be any good?
Ok, then I collected enough courage to try this one (with three players, apparently the optimum) and my mind was blown off.
This is an astonishing experience, you have to make complex chains of delivery and execute them on your turn.

The turn system is one of the most elegant I've seen: you can take somewhat max 10 actions and then pass. The less you take the sooner you'll get a new turn. Thus everyone will have a proper chance and take the same number of total actions.

The chains are well invented: produce food and take it to mine to have coal, silver or iron (I prefer playing that these are not random). Then take coal and iron forward and forward and finally produce a sword - for example. There are a lot of other possibilities and products too.
Reminds me a bit of the first Settlers PC-game and probably that's why I like this one so much, there is really nothing like it in boardgame world.

The turns tend to increase in time towards the end since you have a lot more options and routes to use. AP prone people like me can slow the game too much here, but played with three people, it shouldn't be too big an issue.

It's really great to see how they've handled the option of having hundreds of little commodity tokens! You have a guy in mine means that you have the corresponding product and deliveries are handled by moving your guys from building to building. Don't take too long with that, because on the second next turn if not moved to any elsewhere, they are removed without an effect.

This game was a great experience!

RATING: 7
Enjoyable exercise in converting actions into resources into points. This game is sort of like a Dominionized Roads & Boats - which is to say that each turn, with some planning, allows you to sweep through the build chain and gain some VPs, giving your satisfaction neurons a little hit. That said, there are plenty of opportunities to mess with your opponents by occupying critical buildings, and it's not uncommon to lose a turn or two's worth of effort if someone manages to block you.

One potential negative is downtime - especially given the time-track trick to get two turns in a row, turns can run a bit long.

There is no question that the game should be played with the original mine rules, and I also prefer to have the "scrounging" option.

A brilliant creation for who like serious and interactive games. It’s refreshing to see such a deep game with simple and innovative mechanisms. It’s depressing to see a crap game like Dominion in the top 10 when a chef-d’œuvre like Neuland is not even in the top 500. Not as huge as Roads & Boats but who likes Christmas diners every day? Perfect for 3 hardcore gamers.

I enjoyed my first play of Neuland but played by the Z-Man rules. The random mine draws were extremely annoying and left me with a sour taste in my mouth. I haven't requested it since but I would like to try by the original rules with 3 players. It's a game that walks the line between work and fun but it could be just those cryptic reference cards I dislike. I'm not sure there's not a good game here if I look, but I'm hesitant to do so.

Logistics game. The component artwork does not help make the think time more managable although at first glance it would appear it does. The reference chart each player gets leaves out which terrain the target needs. Also, the rhombus pieces blur together making hex/distance counting and locating the right building just time consuming enough to lose your concentration.

RATING: 6
Potentially very interesting game that will not play smoothly until the learning curve is surmounted. Keeping track of actions is difficult until players can execute a complete plan for their turn without missteps which may result in significant AP. This AP makes for a lot of deadtime for players but all need to stay attentive due to the nature of 'technology tree' and importance of all tile placement. Be sure to keep at least one food producing tile in your posession! Would play again but with a bit more initial study.

UPDATE: Jan 20, 2011: Dramatically downgraded this from an 8 to a 5. My last game was with one player who's a huge fan of Agricola and Le Havre, and the other Ameritrash and Tigris and Euphrates.

The game bombed. I think they compared it to a soul-less Euro. They made jokes about its uninspiring tagline: producing transporting optimizing. Their complaints can be summarized as follows:

A. Imagine a typical cube pushing game. You need this cube to get this cube to get a victory point. Imagine doing that conversion of making a cube to something else TEN times every time you take your turn!

My comment for Die 1. Million also applies here:

Remember the Tower of Hanoi puzzle? You have three spikes. There is a pyramid of disks stacked on one of the spikes. The disks are staked on top of another in ascending size so that the smallest is on top and the largest is on the bottom. The object of this puzzle is to move the pyramid of disks from one spike to another. You can only move one disk at a time, and cannot place a larger disk on a smaller one.

Solving this puzzle is extremely repetitive. This game feels exactly the same. To reach one objective, you have to *repeat* all the steps you did to achieve the previous objective.

B. At least with cube pushing games, the cube conversion chain of events itself is very straightforward; you could spend your time doing more interesting things like taking advantage of special powers/buildings accumulated along the way. Here, in Neuland, the route to generate VP is obfuscated simply by the nature of the game. For example, the building that gives you food is here; the building that gives you silver is over there. But the building that gives you silver requires iron ore and coal or whatever, and those are in two separate buildings. So most of your time is wasted in icon hunting.

To be fair, the original version of Neuland had a spartan graphic design and a chart that clearly described the cube conversion chain very clearly. Perhaps clearer art design would make the game easier to analyze, and thus players can focus on the main ways on interaction:

* Blocking players from certain buildings

* Abusing the "time track": the main way to abuse this track is to end your turn right before the player who should come after you. That way, you can take your turn again. However, in order for this to be profitable, you have to be far away from your opponents.

For example, I am six spaces away from the next opponent in front of me. I could spend five action points, end my turn, then play immediately after, and then take my full allotment of 10 points. The only issue is that I would have to spend the resources I created *before* I spent my initial five action points; if not, I would lose them.

So ideally, I should end my turn right after the opponents ahead of me to prevent them from taking huge double turns.

=====

Wow, much better than I expected. I didn't find much of an AP problem. It's another change this cube to this cube to this cube to points game, which usually dictates the order in which you have to perform your actions, which significantly reduces the number of decisions you have to make.

=====

Anyway, Neuland is like Le Havre except:

1. Shrink the buildings down so that three of them could fit in a hex on a Settlers of Catan board.

2. You have a lot of workers, not just one

3. A worker can stay on a building only one turn

4. Workers can't teleport; if a building is far away, you'll have to pay to get there. Also workers have restrictions to which buildings they may move into.

====

The game is both intense and relaxing. Relaxing because the little logistical puzzles you need to solve in order to build a particular building or resource is not too taxing on the brain. Intense because although producing and building is easy, blocking your opponents at the same time is tough -- but necessary! You don't have enough time to do both!

RATING: 8.2
A game that gives the player a HUGE number of options on every turn, especially as the map fills out with buildings.  It is very difficult to find the 'best' move, very easy to find a good one.  Excellent player interaction, no luck or hidden information, good production quality, and a unique and excellent mechanism to control player turn order.  I have my suspicions that the starting setup is unbalanced, but that may be due to my inexperience with the game, and more plays may erase the penalty I applied and raise my rating even higher.  The more I think about this game, the more I like it.  I certainly intend to play it again.

Excellent little game, I had gripes about the visual representation which could be better. I think I struggled through first half of the game just trying to grasp what is connected to what and where some resources are gotten from etc. After that, it started to go more fluently and the big picture dawned on me.

With a proper visual presentation to help clarify the items, this could be a nice little game that immediately brough the old Settlers videogame series to mind.

 That's one hell of a game and took four of us almost 2 1/2 hours to finally get the concept down right. We will try again now that the system is more clear to us and we are all avid gamers. I personally really like this game and will increase my rating but it won't be for everyone. The rulebook is hard to decipher but thanks to some of the posts here we got it figured out and the best way to start playing is follow the turn example in the rulebook, probably everytime you play until it's completely clear.

Meglehetősen nehéz, összetett mély stratégiai játék. Nekem nagyon tetszik a mechanizmusa, és grafikailag is elég szép.
A körök menete egyedei. Az eltelt időt mérjük, és a jelölőtől legtávolabbi játékos léphet, és nem klasszikus körök vannak. Tehát előfordulhat, hogy egy játékos 2x is jön egymás után.

This is the first "underrated" game that I've tried that I believe is truly underrated. This is a neat little gray matter stir fry. Essentially worker placement, there is a lot of factors to manage. You can manipulate turn order, block other players and take advantage of others' hard earned labor. My 10yo son loves it. Not for the faint of heart but a must for those who enjoy challenging the neurons.

--22Oct2005-- Subtle and ferocious.  Surprisingly, #1 son (10) likes it.
--Jan2008-- He still likes it, a couple years later.  Which is intriguing, since now at 13 he likes very few boardgames.  So what is it about Neuland that is so compelling?  I really don't know, but here are my hypotheses:  1) he likes technology trees with non-trivial structure; 2) he enjoys games where a mistake will doom one - or, perhaps more precisely, he recognizes that he makes fewer unforced errors than his father does and so games which strongly penalize error (unforced or not) are amusing; 3) he finds the chunky minimal presentation appealing.

Pretty cool game :) But we had a game which was very lengthy. Every player wanted to win, so we blocked each other, etc... In the end we were playing mainly to block next player, because there wasn't enough actions to do something else or we couldn't do something else, because we were blocked already... Strange game. But I would like to play it again!

We tried this game once. It takes too long and feels a bit repetitive (each turn you are going to put some meeple on a food producing field, most of the time you want to get stone and wood, too). Also, at the end of the game, it can become a blocking game, since noone wants the other to win. (adi)

Nice and original mechanics, but huge AP problems (don't play with 4 players !) and totally ugly and hard to read components. The action points give a somewhat similar feeling as Tikal (although the ability to play less action points is rewarding). The first player still seems to have an advantage.

RATING: 6
Surprisingly simple logistics game that takes a few turns to get used to, but then you're on your way. The turn order / time order track works well as you juggle your actions in a not at all dry challenge. Not as dry as Roads and Boats at least. With two or three players the downtime shouldn't be a problem and you'll be using the time to plan ahead. Nice bits. A 90 minute timing exercise. Make sure you claim your production buildings and don't get shut out! I like the new Z-Man bits and rules, except for the mines - that random draw can really screw up your plans and removing the depleted mines makes for a tighter game.

Most már tudom mi alapján készült a Glen More. A jó ötletek kigyűjtésével és a rosszak elhagyásával, átformálásával nagyon jól sikerült játék lett a GM. A Neulandban fix 10 akcióidőnk van, amiből kedvünk szerint használhatunk fel és mindig az jön, aki leghátrébb áll az időmezőn. Emberinkkel hexánként 3 épületet építhetünk, amikkel különböző anyagokat termelünk, amit másokban felhasználunk. Célunk presztízsépületek építése, amelyek különböző mennyiségű címerünket használják fel. A játékot az a játékos nyeri, aki először használja fel a játékosszámtól függő címermennyiségét. Tetszett az időmegoldás, tetszett, hogy kicsit a szerencse, csak a bányáknál jön elő, de nagyon kis mértékű. Nekem egyáltalán nem volt átláthatatlan a tábla. Nagy mélységű játék, kimondottan gémereknek való. Nem tetszett a vége. Blue Moon City jellegű, pont annyi épület van, amennyi címerünket fel tudunk használni rajtuk. Nem tetszett, hogy nagy a királycsinálás lehetősége benne és nem tetszett, hogy egyértelműen úgy érzem nem igazán lehet már fordítani benne egy-egy hiba után. Nem rossz játék a Neuland, de sokkal jobbakat alkottak azóta pár ötletéből, így nem igazán sokszor ülnék le hozzá.

RATING: 8
This is a pretty crazy perfect information game. You have to juggle action after action, turn after turn; keeping everything in motion without wasting turns and without idling -- because if you stall, or you get half of what you need too quickly everything falls apart and your workers walk off the job.  The whole thing feels like you are spinning plates.  You have to keep nudging all of your pieces around in order to keep them afloat and in progress.  

Brilliant, but it really is a crazy work intensive puzzler.  Perhaps this will be too much work for some, but I quite enjoy it.  Those that enjoy efficiency and deliberation, but don't want to spend hours on Roads and Boats will get a kick out of this; it crams R&B into a 120-150 min game.

Because this is a perfect information game, it can "suffer" from someone giving up and clogging the game up for others, resulting in somthing of a kingmaker situation.  I don't see this as a problem, but it should be made aware that this is possible, and frankly just not a whole lot of fun for anyone.  

Overall though, quite a meaty mistress. She ain't a beaut, but she gets the job done.

Some novel concepts in this one: the use of a time track so that you can take multiple turns if you don't take many actions on your turn (which I'm sure inspired the creator of Thebes) and the "use-it-or-lose-it" where you only have access to a resource that you produced in this turn or the previous one.  It's a brain burner and prone to some AP, which can drag it out, but I really enjoy the challenge and figuring out how to chain together the products you need.

1 partial play, 4-player. 4+ hours later and we decided to call it quits, mostly because of one player's whining.

DO NOT PLAY A LEARNING GAME WITH FOUR!

This seems like a _really_ cool game of production/supply chain management, with a big dollop of timing and lots and lots of planning. This seems to combine mechanisms from a few other games, producing a nice brain-burny game ... once you figure out the CRAPPY rules, of course!

The game uses the Through the Ages-like mechanic of a token representing either a worker or a resource, depending on how you want to think about it. And like Roads and Boats, once you build buildings they are public -- anyone can use them, although only one player at a time. Using the building (by placing a worker on it) gives you whatever resource that building produces (represented by that same worker token, as in TtA). There is an added complication that you have 2 turns (this and the next) to use a product, or you lose it! Also like R&B, you'll use that product in some other building on the board, to produce something else. But unlike R&B, you don't actually haul a little chit from one location to the other. Instead, the time you spend/waste moving chits around the game board is abstracted: you pay time points based on how far that good needs to travel to the using site! Brilliant! Turn order, then, is similar to Thebes: whoever has used the least time goes next.

There are only a limited pool of buildings that actually give you VP; the game is all about building the buildings that give you the material that allow you to create the products that can be finally be converted to VP. And you have to do it in such a way that you block others, or beat them to the punch -- only 1 of each VP-building is available!

This was very difficult to learn, but I think it would be a lot of fun if you like brain-burning planning exercises, and you play with just 2 or 3.

Rated a 7. Played with 3 players, this is a very original game. Difficult choices every time. Once you get into the spirit of the game it's really lots of fun.

UPDATE:
I now find the game a bit too programatic for my taste. I also think that player #1 has some advantage and that could even decide a game. Rate it down to a 6.

RATING: 7
Complex Euro with worker placement/pick up and deliver mechanism. The first thing you have to negotiate with this game is the rulebook, which is truly atrocious. If the rules can be deciphered though you find a deeply strategic game where the objective is to construct a chain of buildings, with each building requiring materials from the previous one in order to achieve your aim. This requires a great deal of concentration as you have a set number of actions within a turn in which to place your workers in a building in order to produce materials for the next building. Once you get to the last building in a chain you can acquire victory points from it. You need to use a great deal of concentration to be successful in Neuland and a lot of the mechanisms feel somewhat counter-intuitive, which makes the task even more difficult. Whilst the game components are very well produced I do feel however that the game board can become quite confused as more and more buildings are added to it and in a game as difficult as this that ain't a good thing. I guess Neuland is a game I admire rather than enjoy playing.

I thought this was quite interesting and loved the game at first.  But it seemed to lock up hard with four players right at the end.  

I know the game is not recommended with four players.  I'm very willing to give this game another shot with two or three players.  But I am now wary of wanting this game because of the end game.

I would like to pursue whether that type of end game is very common with two or three players.

Picked up at a garage sale for $5.  Lord...the rulebook is AWFUL.

I found the game a little headache-inducing. I did start to enjoy it more as I got into the game a little further, but initially there's a feeling of 'What the heck am I doing?'  I played with only one other player, and we were playing nicely, not really blocking each other, while we attempted to accomplish things.

I think the game is just a little too obtuse for me to find it fun.  And the graphic design doesn't really do it any favors, as things look very busy.

I would play it again, but I have a general feeling of 'meh' about the prospect.

Turning things into things to turn them into points is fine, but the spatial element in this game makes it really hard to keep track of what you need to do.  It seems like building a new building will help your opponents just as much as it does you, and blocking seems to be just plan mean while being effective.

This is one of the few games that I decided to just stop playing partway through because I was so frustrated trying to play.

Neuland is a logistical optimization game, and as such, it may be a little on the dry side for some people.  Not for me though.  I love looking at the "tech tree" of turning basic goods into more complex and rare ones, and doing it at the right time to get the things you need.  There is a very clever time mechanic that determines player order, such that you can take shorter turns more often, or longer ones less so.  Excellent!

Alright well I finally got this one played and I say it's going to take several plays to get the feel for this game. Question is will it be able to make it to the table enough times for that to happen? I don't know if it will or won't. My games was a 3 player game and it'll depend on how well it works as a 2 player to know if it's going to see much table time.

Very unusual euro. Has a time track (take more actions in exchange for possibly waiting longer for your next turn). Sort of like a spatial worker placement game (draft actions and thereby block others) where most actions are just prerequisites for other actions, and if you can't do things in a timely manner you've wasted your moves, because they expire. "Logistics."

Neuland doesn't really remind me of anything I've played, though The Great Zimbabwe came to mind, in that there's a randomized modular board (with varying terrain) where players are building stuff and using each other's stuff, though with no compensation to the builder. That reminded me also of Le Havre: The Inland Port, where you can build a building but you almost don't feel like it's yours.

In Neuland, the building you build is not yours in any sense. You don't have any map presence outside of where you've placed workers. It's pretty impossible to work towards some future goal that is only "for you" and can't be taken over by somebody else for their own benefit. You really have to look at what other players are going to be doing, and what you may be enabling them to do, or you'll get boned, lose actions, help others win. It demands much concentration and I'm not sure how much I enjoy it.

Unlike TGZ or Inland Port, there is no currency. Every action is paid for with time (i.e. time track movement) and/or by the fact of having taken a prerequisite action which hasn't expired yet.

The Z-Man rules are hard to understand. (Dutifully I'm trying to play by the original, deterministic rules.) The artwork is very orange and busy and at a glance I find it hard to tell what is going on. The thought actually crosses my mind, of making homemade, easier-to-read replacements for all the building tiles.

...Tentatively I give this a thumbs-up (7) but it's a close one. The strategy involved in blocking other players becomes interesting. But counting out whether ~10 actions is enough to get you where you want to be, vs. just enough to let somebody run away with what you wanted, is annoying. And if there were no other players in the game, what you're trying to accomplish is very straightforward and dull (get this to make this to make this to get VP). The tiles on the board never seem to become readable at a glance. Instead I remember roughly where certain things are, and then make dumb mistakes when I fail to notice a certain thing on the board.

Rating is for the awful Z-Man edition. Sorry, eggertspiele, but it's all I have to go on, and besides, People Must Be Warned.

Would probably be only fair even without the problems, because it's thematically so dry (even for a Eurogame). But the gobbledegook manual (three different meanings for the word "action," and things which are not equivalent presented as a list) renders this almost incomprehensible. It's also the first time I've ever seen a player aid (the mats for organizing buildings) that actually hindered play. That takes some work.

I'm finding this game hard to understand.  Finding competence is hard.  Our games seem all the same.  The chains are the same.  But it's still a good logistical puzzle.  I'm not sure yet.  The patterns are there, how do you exploit opponents?  Still not sure.  Maybe I'm a weak player.

RATING: 4.5
From what I read here on BGG, I understand that this game really is not that suitable for four players. Unfortunately, I learned this the hard way. First, let me say that Neuland is much too dry and analytical for my tastes. And that ought to tell you something, because I like games like Cuba and Agricola a great deal. It is just that you have to look long and hard at the board to analyse your options and there is a lot of counting while doing so. Secondly, in my experience the downtime in Neuland is really, really bad. Made even worse by the fact that it is no use to plan ahead while waiting, because other players influence your options a great deal. Thirdly, the game allowed itself to get locked due to players preventing the leader from obtaining stone while the leader could maintain a monopoly on things THEY needed for a victory. Quite horrible. All in all, Neuland is an original game which unfortunately fails in its execution. As it is, it is not interesting (or "fun") enough for me to try it with three.

VERY GOOD GAME ! My rating is beacause it is a little bit to heavy for me. Components are good, but building boards could have been more simple and more usefull. For mecanism it's a 9.

After two plays, I need more plays.  The game has a nice mix of screwage, planning & blocking.  Game length can be a little much, but I end up thinking about it the next day, going through what I did wrong, which is a good sign.  The manual is poor, but it's not so complex you need to go back to it much once you understand how the game flows.  I feel this is a very underrated.

The things you build are not yours -- what's yours are your chains of supplies. A game about making sure that you have the resources you need to carry out your plan and blocking other people from getting theirs. My only complaint is that, for the game length, a lot of tiles feel like someone uses them once or twice and then they're dead for everybody, whereas 75% of your game time is spent making sure that you have enough wood.  (1st ed. rules)

I like what the game is trying to acheive. But the downtime is absolutely to much. I might try again with two,

RATING: 6
The idea is neat, particularly the shared resources and inability to protect everything that you build.  Somebody, sometime, is just going to have to horn in on your building.  Does become a bit less fun at the end, when it becomes a game of blocking the other people from winning, which is quite frustrating, and feels like going backwards for everybody.  

In form, this is the classic Euro, with production of resources that turn into other resources that turn into victory points, using lots of timing and efficiencies to try to outbuild the other players.  My impression is generally positive.

The game of flow charts.  I found it to be dreadfully dull.  Basically it is a worker placement game not unlike the Gric, Pillars, et. al.  I found the timing mechanism in this one to make turns long and promote downtime.  It is not a horrible game, I'd play it again - possibly under protest.  Overall it I found it to be just plain boring.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Good, sort of spatial worker placement game, but with significant downtime and "randomness" with 4 newbie players; supposedly best with 3 players. A real brainburner puzzle to progress on every turn under constant "use it or lose it" threat - "the Just-In-Time factory from hell" - with lots of screwage potential by blocking resources - "The Squatters Of Catan" just sitting on resources and without any trading at all in the game doing nothing but harassing others.

I love Neuland, but understand this type of game isn't for everyone. The way the turn order mechanism complements the logistical element is a thing of beauty and a unique, compelling experience. The game is thinky, spatial with an ever present threat of screwage- right up my alley! 

Make sure to play with the original rules, and with three players. I also don't bother with the board included for organizing the buildings, which I find is more confusing than useful to new players. I organize the buildings face-up in a logical flowchart with a clear break between ones that cost wood and ones that cost stone. This has worked extremely well as no one has had issues so far.

RATING: 7
This is an odd game in that it's one of those "Don't end your turn with a lot of good stuff for the next player to do," and that I like it.  I get a little annoyed with games that focus too much on that aspect of the mechanisms, but here it actually works very well.  Given that you'll need at least two turns to develop enough progress to score points, you'll need to block things up for the next player, especially since whatever's on the board doesn't belong to any particular player.  There are a many interesting decisions to make over the course of the game, though learning the game from the rulebook (especially with the Z-Man rules) is enough to instigate a migraine.  I'm very interested in playing this one again, though with the original ruleset.

Only one play, but two things didn't work for us.  One, the game state was a muddle, and too much time was spent just figuring out what could be done where.  Two, random mines made the endgame a lottery, which was stupid, esp. in light of how deterministic the rest of the game is.  The latter is easy to remedy, but the former, not so much.

I just don't see this getting too many repeat plays, unfortunately.  Opportunity cost is just too high.

RATING: 7
Very interesting...  We're in the "play nice" stage with this game since it's a lot to wrap your head around until you're familiar with the buildings, and since getting blocked is absolute brutal (2-3 turns worth of resource build-up can crumble away).  I'm anxious to play a more cut-throat game though, as the game seems pretty clearly designed for that style of play, and would become considerably deeper.

A good Euro with solid bits but overshadowed by better games.  I wasn't a big fan of the original release and marginally more interested in the Z-man edition which I did get through Tanga.  Like the box says, it's about resource planning and technology progression.  If you like that in a game, this one probably won't disappoint you.

The rules appear to have been translated from German to English by someone who is not a native speaker of either language.  The graphics are busy and headache-producing, and 4 player play is about as much fun as a traffic jam.

RATING: 4
Interesting concept. Bad realization. Rating after 2 plays with 4 players.

Downtime is huge; you're quite unable to plan ahead. Even if each player only needs 5 minutes for his turn, you can as well to something else for the next 15 minutes (for a 4 player game). 

To much board graphic (tiles) makes the game very unclear. Less would have been more. As it is, the busy board makes it hard to see your options, and increases playing time a lot. In addition, the game would really need a production chain overview. I can see these problems get reduced when all players have enough experience, but then i don't think the game has a long term replay value.

Might be a good game for play by email, where you can optimize your turn without others sitting around bored. Or maybe ok as a two player game. But i don't think i will play again with 4.

Did not like this on my first play: too much waiting around while people took long turns and the board was extremely confusing to me, with a too many symbols and a cluttered layout. The mechanics are fairly simple and fun, but it really grated on me by the end of the game, when I basically no longer cared what was happening.

This doesn't rate the full '8' because I see how it could bog down as an AP game.  I won't ever play it at home without a timer.  As is, I got to play my first game with 2 experienced games not at all prone to AP, so it moved along at a good speed, but still took a good chunk of the evening to play.

We played mostly 1st ed. rules, with a sprinkling of 2nd.

7 after 1 play.

The mechanic to keep track of time and manipulate turns is fun. However, the production of various materials to produce other materials can feel rather repetitive and meaningless. The number of types of materials make the chain long and introduces quite a number of symbols. Perhaps a more streamlined design will reduce the clutter.

A deeply involving game marred by a clunky ruleset and too much downtime.  It is definitely not for the faint of heart nor the short on time.  I would not recommend learning to play by yourself unless everyone involved is willing to committ to it.

With that said, Neuland is basically a resource acquisition and management game.  I like the clever use of the time track as a way to denote the number of actions someone can take as well as to determine the next player in the turn order.  I am a bit ambivalent on the fact that, provided you still have actions available to take, one can occupy certain buildings just to prevent another person from using it even if he has no need for the item.  It makes for an extremely cutthroat (as well as long) game, and if you're not careful, you could find yourself screwed by having no food at all because it is the basis for obtaining 99% of the other resources.

I appreciate the design and I like in depth games like Neuland.  I'm just not sure if it is fun or if it seem more of an exercise you try to be proficient at.  Jury is still out on this one depending if I actually want to play it again.

Wow, the people who has written these rules, must be a Professor of Literature. What a hard job he (or she) had to fulfill, to write such simple things so difficult down on a piece of paper. Anyway, managed to struggle through the rules, and even could mold them into something which seemed to be logical. During a players turn, a player can do two things. 1. Occupy a building a use it (costs 1 + (distance -1)) or 2 Build a new building (costs (distance -1)). The cost are paid for, by moving a meeple futher along the timeline. That meeple may not pass the timekeeper. Once a player is finished with his turn, the timekeeper moves along the track, and holds the first spot where there is another meeple. That player is on turn now.

Occupying a building is easy. A player places a meeple at the entrance of the building. If there is a resource needed, that is shown on the left side of the building. He has to pay that to enter the building. If he wants to activate it, he has to pay the cost to activate it (see above). For example, a player needs wood to build a new building. In order to produce wood, he needs food. So first thing he has to do is to produce some food. This goes on for every resource needed. The more advanced the resource is, the more steps it will take to get the resource.

Although the board is composed of hexagonal tiles, the only thing that changes a bit is the order of the landtiles a bit. This isn’t that big a deal. Replay-ability doesn’t really increase with this. Also the very bad written rules (even the examples are difficult to read, as there are some differences to the rules written in the manual, and there are mistakes in the examples according to the rules), and the fact that after a couple of builds and production rounds you know how to do the trick, make that this one isn’t very high on our ‘play again’ list. Not a bad game at all, but you’ll have to play this with the right kind of people.

Delightful logistics game.  It feels a bit like a [gameid=875] without the roads (or boats, for that matter ;)), and a bit faster of a game; however, it [b]feels[/b] slower, because you lose the simultaneous play you have for most of [gameid=875].  Still, excellent!

Initial impression: rather easy rules but having to plan ahead makes this game a brain-burner (well, depening how competitive you play). It's kind of Roats & Boats on speed with the Jenseits von Theben player order. Of course the graphics aren't comparable to high print runs but they do the job.I found it hard to get away from the "this is my building" concept...

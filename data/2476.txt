Nomen est omen. This game is rubbish. Very monotonous buy resources, sell resources, upgrade facility, buy more resources cycle type of a game. I did not find any greatly meaningful decisions in the game because the best choice was always too obvious. The only times you had to think were when trying to find the best time to initiate an auction and when rid yourself of waste rather than producing more of it. 

Industrial Waste is not broken, but personally I definitely would not recommend this to anyone because it offers so little fun. Could be much more acceptable if it was of half the length.

Not a bad game although several elements seem not quite as balanced as maybe they should be. The worker track seems to not be as useful as the resource or waste tracks are. Also, many of the cards don't seem as good as the others. This leads to some luck of the draw problems when selecting your group of cards.

this seems one of the harder games to rate after one play.  i liked a number of the mechanics and i loved the look, but i don't see how this one could have a lot of replay value.  it seems like after a while it would just be going up optimal tracks in a standard order.  could return to a 6 or higher if i actually play it again, but that seems unlikely.

RATING: 7
A game with rather simple mechanics, but with a lot of depth in every decision you make. While not specially unforgiving, Industrial Waste makes you really face the consequences of your actions in a future time.

Speaking of which, it's one of those games where timing is key. All actions can be very useful or very useless by themselves, depending on how you mix them up, and especially, when you play them. For me, this is a great element to add tension to a game without putting it on the "rocket science" difficulty level, and I love it.

This, added to the fact that there is no "sure" path to victory, make for a very interesting experience every time you play it.

UPDATE: A great game. I'm liking it more and more every time I play it at Yucata.de (already 10+ plays), and there's something new to try out each and every time I play it. It makes me really sad it's no longer available... I'd love to give it a try with my regular gaming group!

UPDATE: After playing it a lot, it tends to get a bit stale. It's still a great design, but no longer one I absolutely feel I want to play all the time. Down to a 7.5, and likely to stay there.

Possible MultiPlayer SOlitare.  A unique theme and quick play time makes this very intriguing.

First Game: 4-21-2007
I think it is ok.  It does give a multiplayer solitare feeling like in Notre Dame, but Notre Dame is so much better.  They both give the same game feeling but differently themed.  In Industrial Waste the theme is running factory but Notre Dame is medieval Paris.  Cards are used in both games to dictate what actions each player can do.  Both are random but I think Notre Dame is less so.  Before Notre Dame I would have picked up Industrial Waste, but now I think Industrial Waste is obsolete.  If you liked Industrial Waste, you will love Notre Dame.  It is an ok game, but everytime I play it I'll just keep thinking of Notre Dame.

After playing one 3-player game, I'll give this game an 8 but I think that it could eventually go higher. Has many of the features that I like including a bit of randomness (luck) in the card draw, simple rules and numerous strategy options. I'm looking forward to trying out different ways to run my company. Sure, I'll probably get my butt kicked but it will be fun trying!

RATING: 7.5
A nice, well balanced game, simpler than I expected from previous descriptions (and from the rules too) although with perhaps slightly too much luck for my taste - the game certainly seemed to hinge for us on whether good or bad combinations of cards came up when it was your first choice, and who happened to be in the yellow or red when the accident came.

Update: Maybe I was a little harsh. There is less luck than you might think and careful money management will get you a long way. The rules are still too much of a complicated read for such a straightforward game.

Further update: The more I play this the more I enjoy it. There is a great deal of opportunity to forward plan and good timing is important. Pity none of this is obvious the first few (and especially the first) time you play this.

Originally, I enjoyed the game and felt that it had a lot of the "right" stuff.  The limited number of stacks of action cards and the once-around auctions helped to keep the game going at a good pace.  With additional plays, I have begun to feel like the game is fairly scripted (and is decided by luck of the draw) if all of the players try to do the same things.  Unlike other games, there is no catch-up mechanism to help a player who is in down and out.

==

My comparison of I.W. to Power Grid:Factory Manager...
I would say that Industrial Waste has a similar theme, but a different feel.  On the surface (and based on my fuzzy recall of my 1 play of PG:FM), IW feels more simplistic... but in IW you have a lot of potential to impact other players so the game system rewards you for paying careful attention to your opponents (thus it gets complex).  The bulk of the game involves "school-yard picking" of groups of 3 action cards in turn order (i.e. last person in turn order has the fewest choices).  You get to save one action card between rounds which adds some tactics/strategy.  The raw material for factories is auctioned (in Goa-like fashion, I think), which adds another chance for player interaction.  There is a lot of luck in the card draws for the round, but beyond that, it's up to the players to make good choices and not "give the game away".

This is a tough review.  On one hand, I haven&#039;t especially enjoyed all of my playings of this game.  But on the other hand, it seems like there are quite a few winning strategies and you really have to adapt to what is happening in that particular game.  So while the fun factor hasn&#039;t been there in every game, this one also seems to not get repetitive.

This was one of our grail games for quite some time.  We both love economization games, and we happened to see a (semi)shrink wrapped version of it at a random FLGS when we were visiting my fiance's family in Ohio.  Not knowing anything about it, we didn't pick it up, although it immediately intrigued her - she being a fan of sewage systems and the history of hygenic standards.  After doing some research on it, we were excited, but we'd missed our chance to buy it locally, and I couldn't find a copy (new or used) that was going for less than $40-50.  So I finally traded Hannibal (which never got played) for it.  So, is it amazing?  Well, it's very good, and I like the fact that it doesn't take forever to play (no regrets about Hannibal, it never made it to the table... at least, not without a struggle).  So, I'm happy we have it, and that it's in our collection - it fits very well with the kind of games we like.

My first play, I thought this game was average. Second game, I was impressed. Third game, I liked it a lot. It doesn't show the obvious finely-honed balance of an Alea game, but there are still a lot of levers to pull and difficult choices about which is best. It also has a nice balance between short-term optimization and long-term planning. One of the better games of 2001 and recommended.

RATING: 7.5
Upon ending our first play, we immediately went for another. We don't do that often. We liked it and it doesn't take that long. Indeed, our first play saw a very rapid conclusion due to a rather uncommon sprint to the magic twenty done with several consultants. 

Goa is a game I've played which is similar to Müll&Money in that it has this incremental efficiency improvement. Now, some may consider Goa a refinement of that element featured in M&M, yet IMO Goa suffers from too much of a solitaire feeling. It's more gradual progression and doing one's own thing, while in M&M things can go wrong and turn out great in a major way. More interaction and more excitement - not the gradual plodding optimization of Goa.

As for the theme, I like it! Good business theme highlighting waste disposal. Very German given the stricter environmental legislation in our country.

I like this a lot. The decisions aren't always clear, and you have to pay some attention to what your opponents are doing (especially if you are picking your actions first). The only bad thing is that the play doesn't seem intuitive, you have to play a full game before it "clicks".

A light eurogame. The part where you chose which cards you want is pretty neat. The pollution track is nicely implemented too and there are different ways to score victory points. I have just played it twice, but it didn't seem there was a clear winning strategy. Would like to try it again, but it isn't a game I need to own and I would think I would start getting tired of it after a couple of plays.

A really solid experience that works very well as a game.  The theme is definitely tacked on as it never really feels like you are polluting the environment but merely moving your peg on your board up a couple notches.  The Accident card adds the most fun to the experience.  I hope I like this one more in a couple more plays as I have a feeling underlying nuance may reveal itself.

The choosing from random piles of actions is good. Trouble is the tracks mechanism that determines victory points (later used in Goa) is quite dull. I can see myself quickly getting into a rut of making the same choices game after game. I think I would want to play San Marco over this; San Marco has more interesting action drafting with more interesting scoring. I am guessing a 6 or a 7.

This is a fairly unique game, I think. Action selection is a bit like San Marco, but more randomized, so it's more drafting with no cut-and-choose. Interesting and with multiple paths to winning.

An underrated, overlooked gem.  It's too bad more German games don't follow this model- quick playing yet with substantial theme and decision making opportunities and ample interaction.  Most of the negative comments I've heard about this one are balderdash, there is a good bit of player interaction (albeit subtle), there's a variety of strategies, and the theme is a great change from fluff like Balloon Cup.  I have to also salute this game for using the Mute Records logo for one of the companies (the yellow one)- that's just awesome, I can imagine the little black resource bits being converted to Fad Gadget and Depeche Mode records.

Good economic game that offers a decent amount of weight for the short play time.  Players manage a factory with tracks to manage order payoffs, count of workers needed/employed, amount of resources to fill an order/auction, and amount of pollution produced.  Except for pollution, advancement along these tracks results in more end of game victory points.  Each turn, stacks of 3 cards are drawn from a common deck, with one more stack than the number of players.  If the industrial spill card is drawn, players must pay fines and reduce order payouts, unless they're able yo bribe an official to overlook their payout reduction.  The card stacks are the only point of randomness in the game.  This randomness is somewhat mitigated by the limited number of card types, stack choice, and that cards may not be duplicated within a stack.  In order from the start player, which rotates each turn, each player chooses a stack.  In order each player chooses a card to play.  Cards may be discarded instead, if desired.  This is the point that tactics come into play - choosing the order of your cards versus what you think others might do with theirs.  There's a tight balance between increasing profits, gaining efficiency, and reducing wastes all of which is interwoven with the end of game victory points.  Theme matters to me much less than game play.  With that said, the theme works nicely with this game, as does the art.

This game was really fun the first time when we didn't realize how much the waste would really hurt you when the accidents happened.

RATING: 6
This game feels very dry and disconnected, although the theme appears to be well integrated.  Players take cards each round and then try to play them in an order to maximize opportunities.

With your business you are obtaining raw materials and then fulfilling an order, but that creates waste.  Using other cards you can improve the efficiency of various parts of that process, and then choose to increase or decrease the size of your company or workforce.  But be careful of that waste - too much and you'll pay a penalty.

This is an OK game, but certainly not one that I need to own, nor would I request it at a game night.  It's perfectly fine on Yucata, although the materials auctions slow down the game (and don't make thematic sense).  This is a big ball of "meh."

Components: Well-produced boards and wooden pieces. The artwork is well done, but a bit of a turn off due to its dark colors and serious theme. The money is too flimsy. Somehow the iconography on the cards isn't very intuitive.

Experience: Streamlined resource management decisions. I find it interesting having to balance the different elements of my production, especially by keeping my pollution down. I guess the only player interaction is in the auctions, but I find it entertaining enough just managing my own production. Note to self for next time: focus on innovation, because it's the best way to get points.

I think what appeals to me so about this game is the slow build of a working machine.  It resembles the best parts of a role playing game, in that way.  Otherwise, the theme is actually a detraction (trying to lay off as many workers as you can and put out just enough toxic waste - ugh).  The game itself is so-so.  Still, as a whole I'm always excited to play this one.

I really liked this game the first 5 times I played it.  It is very interesting and seemd to have diverse play as well as end conditions.  Then someone showed me on simple strategy and it looked like the game might have a big flaw.  I was never able to find people to play the game with me after that so I could never determine if the game had a big flaw or not.

Interesting game with some novel mechanics (at least for me). The game drags on for too long to be really great as the player that can end it often just sit on the 19 space counting to see if he'll win and if not let the game go another turn.

After one play, debated whether this was a 6 or 7.  Right now, I think it is a good game that I would usually be willing to play (thus a 7).  I like the 3-card-pile drafting aspect of it.  Need another play to try different strategies and determine whether the "innovate" cards are overpowered.  It scores like Goa.  And the "innovate" cards are the main ones that drive up your VPs.  I think I drop it down to a 6 if "innovate" piles are always 1st choice...and "doublers" are 2nd (to be paired in the future w/an innovate).  Game was fun, but it could have a low ceiling.

RATING: 7
Simple business game for 2-4 players. Players run a factory, represented by a play mat in front of them. Three tracks show what is required and output when a contract is completed by that factory. The idea is to get the factory running as efficiently as possible, requiring fewer employees and raw materials to complete a contract, while producing less waste upon completion. Each round is played by each player simply claiming a mini-hand of three action cards each turn and playing them out. These cards tune your factory, allow you to complete jobs, recycle waste, and so on. This is a simple, yet rather fun game that plays quickly.

I like the random spill factor.  Good little economy.  It's the black sheep of the Puerto Rico/Goa family of games.  It's one of those games with dyed black hair, eyeliner, a couple tattoos that listens to NIN, Frontline Assembly and maybe some Throbbing Gristle.

O.K...Time to revise the rating. I put EVERYTHING I own down as a 5 when I first buy it....then revise after a few plays. I must admit that everyone at the games club is VERY happy with this game....I'm not so enamoured. It's good, but turn order can have a DRASTIC effect upon what you can do in a turn, and that makes it very luck based. O.K...You still get a choice, but it;s nothing like the choice that the first player gets......and I know that it should end up balanced, but I dont get that feeling. I'd play it, but I'd rather play something else!

Not sure that this game will have a wide appeal due to the narrow play space it offers. I see it as a one-trick pony in extreme tactical action drafting. You get a choice of sets of three action cards each turn and have no way of anticipating what you'll get as far as defensive (getting rid of waste) and offensive (selling stuff). Accidents happen throughout the game that can catch unprepared players, but it's not always a choice to be prepared. The action round is pretty much solitaire except if someone has the action card to purchase more resources. Then the bidding is Goa-esque in that the person who puts up the bid gets the final bid and gets paid by the person winning the auction (if not them). I like closed economy auctions, so this is a nice touch. 

It does a fairly good job in offering a moment-to-moment exercise in action drafting and balancing your factory elements, though it didn't hold my interest after playing it a few times. Since the game is iconography heavy, I find it too much to ask non-gamers to pick up but it's quite heavy enough for a main course at game night. I moved mine on after a few plays.

One of the very first Euro games i ever bought. I picked it up in London. 
A good game of managing several things at once. I guess it can become a bit stale after lots of plays. Everyone has to be more or less at the same level for it to be enjoyable.
I certainly recommend that you play this one if you can.

RATING: 7
I disliked this when I played it originally years back, but this time it didn't seem so bad. It still has a fundamental flaw though: it's too easy for one player to push for a quick ending. The choice from different sets of action cards is good, the actions themselves are nicely balanced and this time I felt the theme did fit the mechanism. I kept high staff numbers, and pushed my innovations to reduce my waste and then raw materials. I'm wondering now if my higher wages cut into my productivity. Richard ran a very dirty ship, and suffered a lot from the accidents. The others went for progress on the factory board which gave them more profits, but the winner is the one with the most money. As it turned out, my surplus cash won me the game by one point. The only fault I think the game has is that moving your factory right or down has no cost. I'd like to see the factory movement more tied to your innovations, that's where the costs lie. Still, I much more interested in replaying this game now.

*** Played again as a 2P game and I must be more relaxed these days as I had a lot more fun. I still recalled it as being difficult but it's really quite easy progression, and the balance of costs is good. I struggled badly for cashflow and then hit two accidents in succession will in the red zone, which killed me. A tad long for what it is, and needs a player aid for the card actions and good grief some relevant icons would help. But otherwise, you should definitely grab a copy if you can. One for me to keep.

Played 2 times. Initial impression is so-so. Not a bad game, I liked that I had to keep making decisions, but the decisions never felt difficult. I know I need to try this at least twice more. It seems like it could be a good, lighter version of some of my favorite strategy games. The problem may be the lack of interaction. Just felt routine. All players were first-time players though, so w/ experience, it may get a lot better. // Still feels routine. It can be played well, but just doesn't draw me into caring about whether or not I play well -- and I am quite competitive, so this game mystifies me.

AUG/13: Updating my note to say this: Industrial Waste is exactly the problem with Euro games - the balance is so perfect, the game becomes more of a system than a game. Bleck.

A friend noticed that the game was for too "green" to be considered a real simulation.  I fancy the thought that eventually all companies will pay real attention to the waste they generate.  Anyways, invest wisely in your improvements as the accident can come up quite a few times and really bite.

This is a game I can happily return to time and time again. Another bit of resource management that plays well with two and even better with three or four as you tend to be forced to adapt rather more when you don't get the cards you want. In comparison to Agricola, the cards are where it loses out as the way they fall can make a HUGE difference.

Industrial Waste is a straight-forward tactical optimization game based on running a factory and generating (or trying not to generate too much) waste in the process. It is built around a very simple drafting step that doesn't allow for a lot of planning but still provides interesting short-term choices.

Never judge a game by its box.  I think that is the lesson here.  The game looks drab, but all the components are great.  I actually really like the theme of this game.  A nice streamlined design of resource management and advancing your company.  The game is not very heavy, but there is enough meat to keep you engaged.  In some ways this game reminds me of Goa.  I think Goa is the better game as it is more engaging and interesting to me, but Industrial Waste is a great option if you want something lighter.

If don't like Goa, you won't like this. If you like Goa and want a lighter family-friendly option, then you should like this one.

Played 3  3&4 player. The theme hides the rather mathematical structure of Industrial Waste. It is left up to the leader to force the game end. The game can last between 45 mins and 90 mins so this can be a quick game or a medium length game and you will not know at game start which it will be. I need to play more to get more out of the game. I have some strategies I would like to try out. I suspect there are several roads to victory. Dec 04

This game is a little underrated, I think. There are several different things to focus on, and not all are necessarily available to be developed when you want. Good competition for the cards can make a nice, tight game.

UPDATE: Played again finally after many years, and I think it still holds up. There are some similarities to Goa, yet it plays much more quickly. There is very good balance between all the elements, and the luck factor of the card distribution keeps it fresh. Good game.

One play so far, Lost badly, ran out of cash just when I thought I was playing it right. I like this game. Your options are seriously restricted by the cash you have. Got to keep an eye on that. And since earning money is not automatic, you have to have the right cards to earn money and pretty well everyone else wants the same cards you want, thew going gets ugly real soon. Just what I like in a game. Not sure if I'll ever have a chance to play this game again since I don't own it, but I would be quite willing to give it several more tries to see if I can start understanding what needs to be done in order to win.

Industrial Waste is ye olde standard game of min/maxing optimization, the occasional auction, and arithmetic gymnastics though more forgiving than other games in the genre.  It's OK I guess, but definitely nothing to go crazy over.

It plays 2 to 4, but it has some parts that work better with 3 or 4 players than with 2.

Good game.  Theme fits the game very well; however, the theme probably doesn't do anything for the appeal of the game.

The thing I really like about this game is that there appears to be different ways to win.  You need to be able to adapt your strategy to the cards that come available to you.

So close, yet so far.  First of all, the cards barely represent what you can do with them.  Some cleaner icons would have been great.

It just doesn't have that much punch to it.  You can do *some* things differently.  But it's not that different.  You're all going to be operating a factory in the end.

The decisions are there.  Mostly they are decisions of logistics.  What order to do things, and what pile of actions to select.

The sludge penalties are fun though.  You can laugh at the pollutants out there :)

Initial Rating: 5.5 (January 2014)

I have played Industrial Waste many times, however I only played it face to face yesterday so I now can comment on it. The short answer, it disappointed me a bit. A friend has the game so well ranked that I thought it was going to be very good. 

The game components are very nice, however the paper money is very thin, if I keep the game I will get some poker chips. The game has simple rules and it flows relatively quickly, however what I dislike is the length of the game. We were advancing, but many times there were accidents that slowed the game, also some players could have ended the game, but they didn’t have any motivation to do so as they were losing. We played a 4 player game which guarantees that (at most) every third turn there is going to be an accident. Perhaps the game is way better with 3 players. If the game wasn’t so long, I would have rated it higher. What I’m saying, is that I feel the game is too long for what it offers. It becomes way too repetitive.  Perhaps this can be fixed if a player must play the “increase size” card the same way “raw materials” must be played. 

I also was expecting a heavier game. Industrial Waste has some interesting decisions, but they are not hard by any stretch of the imagination, for me, it is more of a family game. The best is phase 2 in which you choose which card are you going to have for the round. Sometimes luck can determine if a player gets good cards or not, but I feel this isn’t a prominent feature, so I don’t mind as much. Love the theme though. I really like that some game designers try to raise awareness of environmentalism (I still have not played CO2).

The auctions are quite interesting as you need to value the raw materials.

Bottom line, Industrial Waste has some interesting decisions, love the auction, but I feel it is way too long for what it offers. I would like to play it with only 3 players.

1st play:  This was a strange game.  One person was able to get ehr factory to the 20 column on the fourth turn, after only one accident.  No one had more than three innovations, no one had taken a loan, and no one suffered from an accident (except for one person in the final tally).  All of the tension that seemed to be built into the game never materialized.  The person who made it to the last column wound up in second place behind me, who had only grown once all game.

I think this means that dashing straight to the last column is not the proper way to go.  This is not incredibly obvious upon reading the rules or playing the first few rounds.

This was a strangely unsatisfying experience, but I want to play again.

A lot of very clever decisions.  Even down to economy and auctions: deciding between how to get cubes, and whether you will be paying the bank or your opponent. (Or, how to get your opponents to pay you for your cubes rather than the bank!) The players determine the end of the game too, which is also interesting.  Each of the 3 "tracks" give you different perks, which could legitimately be an avenue to victory.  You also have to choose between generalization or specialization, each with its own drawbacks and perks.

One of the most finely tuned, best-designed mid-weight Euros I've ever played.  I'd almost call it the "perfect" mid-weight Euro.  Every last angle of it seems to be well-balanced and thought-out, even down to the resource-auctions and the "keep-only-one-card rule".

After 5 plays, upgraded from 8.2 to 9.5.  Brilliant game.

Select a set of cards that allows you to adjust your factory production. You can sell goods for money, but this produces waste that needs to be removed. You can also auction supplies used to make more goods. It just wasn't that obvious how to make improvements that would help you to win. You just kept making incremental improvements. Also someone had to inrease factory production to win, but it was not clear who was in the lead, so do you wait or end it. I would prefer a more automated ending.

Only online play at yucata.de so far. Good game with a focus on tactical optimization. There is some strategy behind that but it consists mainly in concentrating the effort on maximizing selected fields of development while generally keeping flexibility as high as possible. Scales well from two to four players.

A descent resource management game with a flaky environmental theme. The whole thing balances pretty well. There are some timing issues in terms of which actions you want to take each turn, but I can't imagie it would be a bad strategy to take technology improvements ar every possible opportunity. I think that the improvements of resource needs and waste production turn out more valuable in the long run compared to workforce efficiency. The few bucks you save on overhead each turn seems mediocre compared to being able to purchase less resources and avoiding those expensive accidents. Anyway, if the improvement cards get snapped up in front of you, it'll be a poor effort to compete.

This is a perfectly solid game that I would have enjoyed much more had I played it when it was originally released.  At this point there is not too much to distinguish it from the hordes of economic management games.  Still, Industrial Waste feels challenging with very few rules, something that is notable.  I find the theme a little bit of a distraction, especially seeing how hollow and fleeting a genre industrial ended up being.  It is kind of ridiculous that Mute is classified by this game as "industrial".  Come on!

RATING: 7
I like this game as a Goa-lite game:  it has track developments and the once around auction.  However I feel the game is a bit unbalanced.  Technology improvement seems to always be in high demand.  The waste and resources track seems much better than the worker track.  The 2x, and the order cards are also good.  The move factory up and the factory down cards seems relatively weak.  I think it would be a great game if some of these factors are balanced.

Intéressant, mécaniques qui ont bien vieilli (il pourrait être sorti cette année, c'est une cuvée 2001). Choix d'actions par paquet de 3 cartes intéressant. Gestion de la production sans faire trop de pollution difficile. J'ai trouvé que je n'avais pas trop de contrôle à moyen/long terme, à chaque tour on essaie de faire le mieux avec les actions disponibles (soit parce qu'on a plus du tout d'argent, on DOIT produire ou vendre des barils, ou soit parce qu'on a trop de pollution, on DOIT dépolluer) et tout d'un coup quelqu'un finit la partie. C'est peut-être mon inexpérience qui cause ce sentiment. 7/10. (04-2014)

Initial Rating 8. Very good game! Initial rating. I had a lot of fun even though I got smoked! (-1!!!) I will definitely be looking to play this one again! Edit: Increased to 8.5. I played This and Goa back to back and I have to say this one wins out! It's only slightly less meaty, in less than half the time (an hour with training others). Very nice!

Rerated to a 6: After many plays it is still a good game but the "greatness" has definitely worn off. I still like it - but I think I've burned out on it.

The game is fine, but I didn't find it particularly interesting. The most interesting mechanic is the card drafting. For each round you create sets of three cards, one for each player, and one more. Then you go around the table choosing which set of cards you want. Everyone can see all the choices available. This is a decent game but it's not something that I have a strong desire to play again.

I've now played this game many times, and my appreciation has modified over time.  While the luck of the cards is very much present - there is ample opportunity to apply skill to this game.  Deciding how to tune your plans to the cards you receive is important.  Doggedly sticking to a strategy is probably a bad plan - you must react to what tools you have to work with.  I find this game to be very thoughtful, yet it plays at a comfortable pace.  Industrial Waste is a very good game, that has been expertly packaged to appeal to business game fans.  When the day is done, it doesn't offer quite enough control to please a hardcore gamer.  The theme is too heavy for a casual gamer.  So it is just misfits like me who appreciate it.

Wow. Great economic game that plays in around an hour.

The game is very well balanced towards the end scoring. 
Allthough I thought the colours on the cards were bad and hard to tell apart within a couple of rounds we didn't have to look for their meaning anymore and didn't have any problems in telling them apart.

This one is a keeper.

A multi-tier "systems" type of game and with the waste mechanism, you have a push-your-luck element.  I suspect that the first row (workers/employees) is not very worth pursuing unless no one else pursues it.  It costs two cards (one to push on each two boards) to give a player benefits (and one a reduction -$1k to your expenses).  Seems like the other two rows (raw materials and recycling/venting waste) are much better to pursue and they each give you just as many victory points.

(Comment on 2nd play - Really enjoying this - though the gap between plays had meant I had forgotten an important rule the bits I had remembered still provided a challenging experience).

You largely play this solitaire but it is lonely when you are the boss.  On your turn the range of options maybe to reduce the staff, dump the waste or bribe.  Not actions to inspire joy. The game is also an example of a game which interests me.  A game where you have to make essentially damaging choices to win.  A route to victory may include the reduction of staff for example though this is not essential as you may choose to become more 'efficient' in other areas.

Consequently my only game so far (hopefully there will be more) was a grim affair but tense, close, thought provoking and ultimately rewarding experience.

In addition though fortunes fluctuate and the ending has the potential to be explosive the game is built on a strong foundations and all the elements interact well together to provide a much larger game than its components. Recommended.

PS The version I played with did not have a player aid which would of been helpful in the early stages.

A capitalist's game if I've ever seen one.  More efficent machines let you fire your workers, auctions for raw materials can bankrupt a player completely, and you are constantly worried about the toxic waste you produce, but only because you might be caught in an inspection.  The socialist in me groans at the realities in this game, but the gamer loves it.  Drafting the actions each round is fantastic and plays quickly but with depth.  Plus, there's a NIN corporation, and why wouldn't I want to be Nine Inch Nails producing industrial?

Loved this game very much when it's released back in early 2000s, eventually buying a used copy early this year. Finally got a chance to play after maybe more than 10 years :)
The core mechanism of the game is copied by many other games, like Stockpile and Dream Home, to say the least. It does have some dated feel, and 1 opponent who's also a game designer and played this game before mentioned that the most important technology is always waste disposal as it can make you care much less for dumping waste. Need to play more to confirm whether this is true, but it not quite difficult to ask others to play a 17 year-old game with me nowadays...

Bought on eBay in June 2006.
It is an interesting mix of mechanics.  I was trounced soundly my first game (against 2 veteran players) but it just made me want to play more.  All the choices are out there on the table, and even though there is obviously some "luck of the draw," since you get 3 non-dupe cards per turn, there is a good spread.  The once-around auction I think was my undoing as I overbid at least once.

A quirky, interesting game. I love the theme and the graphics. I think of the "accidents" as "inspections" which works better for me theme-wise. Everytime I play this I wonder if this game is as good as I believe it is, and usually the answer is Yes.

My first impression of the game is very positive and I look forward to playing it again. The mechanics seem to work very well together, the card draw and choose mechanism is really the heart of the game and it works quite well generating the right balance between angst and control. In an abstract sense the game really is nothing but an exercise in accounting; it feels almost like playing with a spreadsheet. But the theme and the slight randomness introduced by the cards overcome that and in the end it felt like it was more than just a dry number crunching exercise. It felt a little like running an actual business. If I had one criticism it’s that I think the game needs something more, more chrome or more choices or something. Often, after your initial choice of which set of 3 cards you’ll take, the rest of your turn can play out rather automatically. However, if you like business games then definitely give this one a try. ****UPDATE**** Played again with 4 players and raised my rating a point. The game didn't take any longer (it is just the right length for its depth) but the auctions were improved with the addition of the fourth player.

Manage your waste production in the production of power, optimize number of workers and so on. Earn money to win the game, but watch out for your waste. Game has some potential However, the timing of the accident card (like Union Pacific dividend card or Mogul crash card) seems to influence too much who will do well and who will not. You might get time to clean up your waste, or if you are in debt, you may be further in debt when the accident hits. It's not a bad game, and I could play it occasionally.

Its got a few good elements (picking of cards by players), an economy of limited resources, improvements to your own capacity to do things, etc but the total package seems to come out as less than the sum of the parts.  This one will probably stay on the shelf for a while before getting played again.  Have since traded away this game and don't miss it.

RATING: 8
You’re a manager of a factory where you get money by putting on works. To put on a work you need workers (which you get for free) and resources (which you get by auction). A work also produces waste, which is a bad thing. 

At the start of a round, there are (number of players + 1) sets of 3 possible actions (aka cards) layed out. Each player chooses a set in turn. There are about 8 different types of possible actions so getting the exact combination you want, and still having it available when it’s your turn to pick, is unlikely. This is the first level of interaction in the game, picking sets in turn.

Once your set of actions is chosen, you execute one by one in player turn. Possible actions in your set include putting on a work, auctioning off resources (‘once round’; this is the last source of money and the last source of interaction), improving your factory (so it needs less workers or resources, or produces less waste), reduce your waste, etc. At the end of each round you have to fork out cash just to keep the factory going (there’s an action to reduce the amount ongoing), so there’s a constant need to put on works or auction off resources to keep the money coming in. And that generates waste. Waste is a bad thing because you have to fork out penalties if your waste is too high when the accident card is revealed (every second round on average). 

The scores are always going to be tight because there is little differential in the ways to improve your score. For example, you can improve your factory to limit waste production by max 4 levels, which by the end of the game means you won’t need to pick up ‘reduce waste’ actions. But you’ll have spent 20 million (10 VP’s) to gain 14 VP’s in level improvements - not much return.

On initial plays, the winning strategy seems obvious - get your "waste per work" down as quickly as possible so you can do "works" without having to waste future turns fixing your waste. With a combined urge to do works, auction prices for goods crept higher with each game, so a new strategy developed around doing no works, just selling goods to other suckers (sharing half the money of a work with the buyer, but with no waste ramifications). And that strategy was found to be successful. To counter that, another strategy evolved - get your "goods per work" requirement down as fast as possible to minimise your purchases, or get cheap buys when you put your own stuff up - and that won games as well. 

We found games were taking a few more turns than they did initially, so a strategy involving getting taxes as low as possible asap (ie advancing your tech tree and factory requirement in tandem) so as to save ongoing money won games. That was countered by the rush the endgame strategy, usually in tandem with the seller strategy, so as to take the result by surprise. 

The only strategy that hasn't worked so far is the red zone approach - forget about waste, just pump it out. One day I'll crack it. 

Any given game has all these strategic undertones (who's doing what and what's the best approach given what they're all doing) so, when combined with the tactical struggle of managing your cashflow and being able to take advantage of the card sets that come your way, it's resulted in a game that's still enjoyable and requested after many plays.

There aren't too many short economics games that are any good, but this is one of them.  You get to draft a bunch of actions that you take during your turn, and then try to make money and improve your factory without creating too much industrial waste or being forced to take loans.  Upgrading your factory is worth more points the more you do it, but everyone goes after those actions, and you still have to make sure you have enough money to do so.

Played it once. I much prefer Goa. Comparing the two, Goa is like a fine t-bone steak and industrial waste is like the bone with a few pieces of meat left on it. It just felt too dry and boring. Take some cards, move some pieces, pay some money, do it again. To each his own. There is little screwage, you cannot affect the others too much with your actions. In Goa you can block your opponents strategy in the auction faze. In Industrial Waste you just take whatever bunch of cards is left.

RATING: 7
It's all about waste!  Personnel improvement is not an effective strategy.  An increase in scoring (plus one level) might be an answer. Watch your money to the very end, that last 'accident' can be a killer. This is not much of a 2-player game, so don't bother other than to learn the rules. Update: Putting all technology into waste generation reduction and selling resources as often as possible  to other players may make it very unnecessary to do much production or ever have a waste issue. If so, rating will certainly fall.

Talk about card-driven. This game practically plays by itself. Select your optimal strategy (there really aren't many), and pray that the cards available at your pick will fuel it to the max -- or else, your opponent will gradually inch away from you. The use of cards is always obvious, and there's very little long-term planning, if at all. No excitement, no real surprises. What little player interaction there is is bland and unimaginative. The cool player panel is this game's sole grace.

A clever little game that has mechanics since reused in similar fashion: essentially a game about risk and money management. Players are running factorie. After drafting a set of cards, they use these to auction and purchase raw materials, upgrade, produce goods, hire/fire staff, recycle to keep waste low (to avoid hefty fines), etc.

Money doesn't seem tight in the game but it will be at the end and the winner is usually the one with best economies of scale. Playable in over an hour.

Economic, Auction, Card Drafting. I liked this well enough - it has some good decisions but a couple of elements felt just a little off to me. It didn't feel like the "waste" part of the game was strong enough - we only had one spill in our game (not counting final scoring), so not sure if that's anomalous. Also, I think design of the cards could be better - there didn't seem to be much rhyme/reason to the color patterns on them and they only had indicator icons, where it could have used text or at least an icon-based graphical representation of what each card does.

I can see how this game slipped under the radar.  It plays straightforward and has virtually no strategy, but it absolutely excells as a fly by the seat of your pants tactical response game.  The game itself allows for you to take a few different options, and from what you are given you must make the best of it.  This is a battle of increments and risk management.  The game has quite a bit of variety for play that each game should play differently enough to continue to excite.  There isn't much player interaction over what you leave your opponent, but I find that the remainder management plays far superior in this compared to something like St. Petersburg. Perhaps the two player game should have one more column to choose from though (I'll have to try it that way).

RATING: 7
A lighter version of Goa in many ways, sharing the feel of the latter game but playing much more quickly.
- instead of the complicated action selection auction, you have a simple turn-order based card distribution. 
- similar (but fewer) technology tracks
- auctions are to each other, so since cash=VP controlling the amount of cash in the game plays a role

--- Summary ---
Each player starts with 15Euro (keep hidden), 5 raw materials, and player board with all tracks marked at leftmost space. Factory board (showing #workers in company on y-axis, factory productivity on x-axis) shows each player's factory in upper left.

Each round begins with card distribution: create n+1 sets of 3 cards (if Pollution Check drawn, players pay 5/10 euro penalty and move factory 1/2 spaces left if their waste is in yellow/red area of track; at end of turn, reshuffle entire deck). In turn order, players choose one of these sets. Unchosen set is discarded.

On your turn, play a card (may play a card without using it) or pass (only if you have 0 or 1 card). Cards allow you to
- auction raw materials (# equal to your tech level; once-around, you bid last)
- fill an order (must have at least as many workers as shown on "rationalization" track, and use up #raw materials according to tech tree; earn cash according to factory position on chart)
- move factory 1 space rightward (game ends at end of turn when any factory has reached 20)
- advance tech tree one level (pay $5)
- reduce waste (possibly force others to increase waste level)
- double effect of another simultaneously played card or increase earnings; or pay off a loan (may take 10euro loans at any time)

After everyone has passed, pay workers (based on factory position), pass the Start Player marker left, and play again. Game ends at end of a round in which a factory reached 20 column (even if it doesn't stay there); then, do a final Pollution Check and do end-game scoring:
+ factory size
+ VP from tech tree (each track earns 1/3/6/10/15 VP based on your level of advancement)
+ (cash / 2, rounding up)
- (# loans x 10)
Most VP wins.

Efficiency game where you have to manage waste levels, worker usage, and other factors.  The system for picking actions is nice, but there's not a whole lot to recommend one kind of action over another, so the end result is not all that exciting.

RATING: 8
I should have guessed by the title and the theme that you have to advance your industrial waste technology to have a chance.  I enjoy most business oriented games, and this one is no exception.  I also like the drafting mechanic quite a bit.  Will be interesting to see how much strategy and replayability it offers.  My initial impression is to pay attention to your waste technology first, then move your labor technology mainly for the victory points benefit in the latter case.  Try to conduct auctions often to have adequate cash to fund technological advancement.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is a quick game of economic optimization with just not enough strategy to really stand out in my opinion.  The game is mostly about luck and decisions are easy to come by with very little chance to out-think your opponents.

In this game each player represents an industrial band, I mean company, trying to earn the most points by the time one company reaches the last spot on the growth track.  Points are obtained through company growth, improvements, and mostly money.

The game is played by each turn laying out a number of rows of 3 cards each, each card does something different from growing and improving your company, acquiring raw materials, selling refined goods, and recycling waste among others.  This is where the most amount of gameplay comes in, choosing the right row of 3 cards.  There are never any duplicates in a row though and typically what a player needs most in a round is pretty straightforward.  Plus whoever happens to be first player that turn may get very lucky or very unlucky depending on what they need and what comes out.  I felt like there were too many situations in my first game where my opponent got exactly what he needed when he was first player and I didn't see the cards I needed when I was.

Outside of that there's not much to the game.  Scores are most likely going to be close as each player will most likely be doing very similar things because there aren't a lot of different strategies to pursue.  Everyone is probably going to be equally growing, improving, and producing with minor variations.  In my first game, for example, my opponent grew and improved a little more than me having gained an extra spot in improvements and two extra spots in company growth by game end but I had half as much more money as he did and the final score difference was 1 point.  I just didn't get much out of this game.  It's not bad, just extremely average and forgettable.

A light game with some interesting choices. Will play occasionally because it play relatively fast.  Seems like a player or two could get "screwed" royaly early and never catch up. Updated 07/11/06 played a whole bunch lately, I've upped to a 6,  might even go higher,  because it plays so well and is actually less luck driven than I thought.  Turn order plays a heavy role in decisions, if your picking late, your not likely to get good cards, if your going to pick first next turn channces are you will get exactly what you hope for. Updated July 2007, this game is probabaly the best IMHO 60 minute game, therefore I'm raising to a 8

Some interesting concepts in the game, but there were a few serious design flaws. The random element of an Accident happening and the consequences for it mean that reducing waste production is your #1 priority. Not only that, but by advancing on the "less waste" track you're also scoring increasing victory points. In comparison to the other tracks: the worker track which takes two cards to actually reduce your upkeep by 1 a turn, and the reduced cost of goods to produce an order which also hurts your auctions of goods... the reduced waste track is simply far better than anything else. The neat elements in the game don't make up for the major flaws. It isn't bad per se, but it definitely isn't good.

Has some Goa-elements. Or should it be the other way around (Goa has some mechanics of this one)? Yet, you don't have the flexibility as you do have in Goa. Especially when it's your turn to choose first from the action-card piles, you are dependant on something fitting into your plans. Whereas if someone screws your plans in Goa, the alternatives turn out to be quite as promising or even more rewarding than the original plan. Still quite a fine game of finding the right balance in your economics. By the way, money is really scarce in this game. If only now someone could tell me, what Nine inch nails have to do with it ...

I only played this once, so the rating might go up, but there really didn't seem to be a whole lot going on, although the game itself was attractive.

[After 1 play] Nice business game, I enjoyed this a lot. Definitely willing to play again. I wonder a bit if innovating to reduce your waste production may be significantly more valuable than the other 2 innovation tracks.

One of the underrated gems in BGG. Small piece of art. Only problem is that especially in four player game it is possible to stuck of line of disasters in factory, which can decrease experience.

This is a solid mid-weight game; decisions are tense and pursuing different strategic paths is interesting.

Not bad, but doesn't grab me like some other games do.  I think it has to do with the fact that the card draw is too random and too critical for success.  I do like the theme of trying to be as environmental as possible, though.

2 plays: 4 players

Factory management and economy. Not a pretty game. I'd need to play this on board, rather than only in Yucata.

Rating based on two plays. A funky engine game in which you try to fulfill orders without piling up too much waste since the EPA will slam your butt in the big house if you pollute too much. You can reduce workers to lower costs, increase efficiency to reduce the need for raw materials, or recycle better to reduce waste, but you don't necessarily need to fulfill orders to win if you can get others to buy enough raw materials from you. I need more plays to further explore this title...

A really good game.  Relatively short with lots of interesting choices.  I think this one doesn't get the love it should.

It's aged really well, and still merits plays.

This game is better than its ratings would have you believe.  I think it is out of print but if it was ever reprinted I'd buy it.  EDIT: Got this in a BGG trade.  wOOt!

RATING: 7.5
Played a few times (mainly with 3 players). The theme of this game may not be really attractive and can turn some people off, but it is not much of a problem for me. The mechanics are simple and lead to interesting decisions. My main regret is that it might be a bit too short - I always feel like much more could have been done in this game. Still, an enjoyable game, especially with 3 players.

I liked this (1 play with 4), even though I had my hat handed to me. I was only able to take 1 of 2 opportunities for advance technology. But that looks like a fluke.

It seemed that you could really try several different paths here and still end up winning. The thing I did not like about the game was that the cards are both ugly and very non-intuitive regarding their function. I think this should get a republishing.

THE most beautiful game I own, with great bits and and nice artwork.  The cutouts on the player boards are a really nice touch.  The game is lighter than you'd expect at first glance, playing like a light version of Goa.

RATING: 6.5
Definitely an interesting title.  It feels like some strategies are quite a bit weaker than others, but that may have been circumstantial in the games I've played, too.  Quite the odd theme, too.  There's nothing quite like sacking half of your workforce while simultaneously ignoring the mountain of toxic waste you're producing.  Few games give you that opportunity.

Nice theme but ultimately a forgettable game without much innovation.  You basically play the cards you are able to obtain, especially if you are last in the selection.  Relatively quick and harmless.  Loans seem pretty much unnecessary as no one was actually in any danger of running out of money, although income could be harder to come by in a four player game.  I guess the only annoying thing was the constant reshuffling of the deck whenever the accident card is drawn.  Average but not spectacular.

This is a little strange to explain without just diving in and playing, and a couple of the icons don't facilitate the learning; however, this ended up being an interesting excercise in how best to reach your goal, with a number of options available.  This seems like a game with good replay value.

This is a fast paced very good game. Not more than 60' to have a nice management challenge. Theme and graphical quality could be more captivating. Excellent bits material (I own German edition).

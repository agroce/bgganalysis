A game where each person is trying to create their own crossword puzzle as fast as possible. Will require more plays for me to give a real rating but for now it is a 6. It's better than Scrabble, but that's not saying much... If you like word games, this is probably a good game for you.

Love word games like Boggle, Scrabble, and Quiddler, but hate this one.  I don't know if it's the speed aspect because that doesn't bother me in Boggle or if it's just that my brain has to reset everytime someone yells to draw another tile.  My mindset is geared toward Scrabble where I'm looking for the best point words and having time to think without interruption which isn't how this game works.  Would have also liked some sort of grid mat to lay the tiles so that rows and columns don't go awry.  Wanted to like it, but was frustrated and the game just fell short for me.

[I]tl;dr - There's nothing wrong with Bananagrams as a light real-time scrabble game. But if you are bad at realtime and/or word games, this isn't for you...or me![/I]
[COLOR=#CCCCFF]____________________________[/COLOR]

My wife loves Bananagrams, and try as I might I can't come up with a technical reason why I dislike the game. Sure, they ripped off Scrabble, but the concept is sound and interesting -- you can find this one at Walgreens, ALDI, and Target for a reason! It's simple and great fun, if you're good at real-time word games. 

Now, if you're awful at real-time word games, Bananagrams can be a crushing experience. For me, this game is unsettling and difficult to grasp. Every time someone yells 'Peel!' my available tiles change and my decisions correspondingly have to change. I can never ditch my tiles fast enough and always finish dead last. 

I know this is apples to oranges, but [thing=164158][/thing] makes a fun co-op game out of word-building, which I really enjoy. And of course, I think I'd still go with the classic [thing=320][/thing] for a really intense word-building jam.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A fun, quick, light word game. There's no scorekeeping, which is nice (and rare in word games). It is also fast, with all players scrambling to make little crosswords instead of sitting there forever trying to think about each turn.

There is no "banana" anything in this game, besides the carry case. You could probably play it with Scrabble tiles. The banana-style is cool and interesting, though, which is a plus.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
I prefer taking this with me somewhere I know I might get bored rather than a deck of cards.  Word games and randomization of letters in a little bag.  The included game isn't too bad either, but the draw here for me is that I can play just about any word game I want with a set of generic letter tiles.

I pretty much avoid word games (although I tolerate UpWords). However, this game is just really fun. It's also frantic because you're racing against everyone else at the table. But it's whispy cool because you can build any combination of words that fit your mood. Bad draws (like any word game) can ruin your chances of victory. Still, I enjoy forming odd combination of words with difficult letter stacks. It's at the top of words games for me.

(Solo) 
Better than scrabble. Fun, fast tile laying word game.

One of the best things about this game that I enjoy more than scrabble is that each player has their own playing area. It's less restrictive, more free form. Overall I find it a much more pleasurable experience.

I just don't get how this game came to be -- the concept seems so obvious and even moronic, and yet, it's not only a game but a very good one at that. 

The rules are simple, and the chaotic, just-have-at-it dynamic is a lot of fun.  Very much a solitaire experience, but with the time pressure of worrying about your opponents' progress.

House rules: Divide all tiles equally between players.  There's no time limit and no scoring.  When all players are done, go around the table and each player reads their crossword as a beat poem.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.6
Don't fear playing with only 5-letter words or up.  It's more satisfying to break apart and rebuild your crossword several times while your opponent is still trying to insert their "G" into some existing offshoot.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I'm not the biggest fan of speed word games, as it's only fun as a game if your opponents have the same skill level. Plus, fighting over the validity of words is never fun for me. Still, it's a clever game--pretty much a classic--just not my thing. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Quick and fun, and the kids enjoy playing too. Since you just make words with your own tiles, it doesn't really matter much if you're losing - you can pretty much ignore the scoring and just play for fun.

A fast-paced, real-time word game that plays better with at least four players, maybe best after some drinks. The goal is to be the first player to finish creating words out of one's tiles and arranging them in a crossword puzzle-like fashion.

Fun, fast word game, but one that relies on player honesty/competency to keep individual grids legal throughout the game. Banana packaging is a neat concept, but shouting "peel" "split" and "dump" feels a bit contrived. You can play a passable version with a set of Scrabble tiles, as a taster.

In Short: A more individual & dynamic version of scrabble.

The Long Explanation:  Each player is to create an individual crossword puzzle "free-range" without any border boundaries or any score multipliers.  Players play on their own section, and all play occurs simultaneously, as fast as the players can create their words.  This is sort of a mad rush as everyone tries to finish first.  At any point, you can rearrange your entire puzzle if you wish, so things can change very quickly.  As soon as a player has completed their puzzle, using all of their letters, they shout "peel" and everyone grabs another letter tile, having to add it to their set.  If you have an unwanted tile (e.g. Q or Z) you can dump it back into the middle, but have to take 3 additional tiles to replace it.  Once there are no tiles left in the center, whoever is the first to completely use their tiles is the winner.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
I am very biased about this game because I hate games that involve words and spelling because 1. I don't enjoy it and 2. Im not good at it. On that note if you are looking to challenge someone that typically makes 3 letter words than I am that person.

More of a word toy / puzzle / activity than a straight up game. It's okay as a game. If the description sounds like a fun social activity to you, then you will probably enjoy it. I like the gaminess of Scrabble a bit more, but Scrabble is less of a social activity and more of proper game. The serve different purposes.

Not as interactive as Anagrams, but fast and reasonably fun. I enjoy a party game type variant where everyone circles around the table to take over their neighbor's spot during the game.

I played this game with my wife and my parents and it was a lot of fun. The only problem is that my parents are regular Scrabble players and also very into crossword puzzles and such so they beat us in all but 1 game.

So with the right people (i.e. all those at the same "level") it is really fun but I suspect that if someone is really good at word games it might not be as fun.

Using a selection of plastic letter tiles, each player works to create their own 'crossword'. When a player uses up all their letters, all players take a new tile from the pool. When all the tiles are gone, the first player to use up all the tiles in their hand wins.

All the fun parts of Scrabble with very little of the frustration of Scrabble.  My wife says she prefers it to Scrabble and I don't have any problem playing this multiple nights a week.

We started pulling out 30 random tiles after we draw our initial hands to cut the game length down closer to where it would be with three or more players.  Bananagrams' perfect length IMO is 15-20 minutes and this method puts the two-player game in that range.

My wife has a degree in english and writes professionally. Scrabble was an enjoyable game for her so when I found this on the shelf at Target I just bought it.

We've played countless times and even solo. This game has been great to break out with family and older people. Most everyone knows how to play scrabble, so when you tell them there is no board and you can change your words they get almost excited.

Personally, I'm not a words guy and the game doesn't have the depth I enjoy. However, it does make a great pickup game and is easy to get non-gamers into.

As a word game, this is pretty good.  It's a bit like Scrabble and a bit like Boggle, but I feel like Bananagrams gives you more control than either of those games.  And, as long as you can handle the "speed" mechanism, it's quite fun to play.

RATING: 7
Fast, simple, word game. Love playing, but hard to find opponents who enjoy playing with me. Fact that the game relies on the honor system at times is a fault.

RATING: 4.5
Simultaneous play prevents anyone from catching errors on others' plays until game end.  Sure, the "cheater" is disqualified from winning, but there's no satisfactory way to decide the actual winner.  Plus, the disqualified player is probably the one who put the most pressure on everyone else to play faster!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
Complete miss for me.  Its a crossword type game without any strategy of better genre games like Scrabble.  The random luck of tile draw and simultaneous play without any means of addressing human errors make this one I'd rather sit out than ever play again.

// I'm typically not a fan of word games and I'm fairly
awful at Scrabble, but this game gives me practically
unlimited flexibility and lets me do things I wish I could
do in Scrabble, like build words in all different 
directions however I want to, and even spell words 
backwards. A round takes maybe 10 minutes max, and given
the flexibility the game offers, I'd definitely play this
rather than Scrabble (given the choice).

RATING: 4
It's just a super-fast, filler game that plays out like solitaire "speed" scrabble and penalizes players who haven't memorized words that use Q and short words from the Scrabble dictionary.  I'm not a fan.  It's probably best if players are of similar skill levels... or if handicaps (such as draw 2 tiles instead of 1) are given to certain players.  The winner is the lucky player that can place his last tile at just the right time (when 4 or less tiles remain in the pool), which is pretty lame.  I still prefer Pairs in Pears to feel like I'm doing something.  I might enjoy playing Bananagrams with a minimum word length such as 4+ letters, where the focus is on longer words.

Nice little tiles, really bland game. Could be played with scrabble tiles, you just make words in an individual puzzle, with no competition. Its a bit odd.

RATING: 5
A cute crossword puzzle game that's extremely portable.

Where it falls flat for me is if one person is able to quickly use up their current tiles, they force a new tile onto the opponent(s).  That's fine once, but after five or six it's a lot harder to incorporate those tiles.

Good for teaching letters and words to children, and as a filler.

Quick, somewhat tense (but not that much). With two players, there are moments where both players sit staring blankly at their tiles. UPDATE: This game is a lot better with no "dumps," and drawing 2 tiles each "peel." Perfect for post-work nights. UPDATE: 8 -> 7. I still like this game, but it can sometimes drag with 2p. UPDATE: 7 -> 6. AS my interest in meaty games grows, these light games have less appeal. Plus it feels very random.

All the fun of Scrabble without any downtime, worrying about scores, setting up the opponent for triple word scores, not having space to place a good word...

I prefer the variant where you split the tiles between all players over the standard peel rules. The reason being is that, in the regular version, the person leading the whole game often has a more difficult time winning than someone who is slightly behind the leader when the end times come.

My wife and I often play Wordfeud and like it quite a bit. It’s basically Scrabble for 2, but you can play a word whenever you want; I like this because traditional Scrabble may drag a lot when people are thinking about which words to create. Bananagrams is a FAST word game like Scrabble but without the scoring, so you don’t need to create words which cover a “triple word” and such in order to maximize your score. In bananagrams, you just need to create your own words as fast as possible in your own little grid, so the player interaction isn’t that big (except for when a player gets rid of all of his tiles in which case every player grab a new tile to place). It plays in 10 minutes or so and 2-7 players can enjoy this game which I think is great as I can use it as a very short filler like For Sale.

Like a speedy scrabble game. I don't have the most expansive vocabulary, so I thought it was ok. The pace of the game adds a rush to frantically use all the letters.

Players draw a number of Scrabble-like tiles from a common pool.  To start, flip the tiles then attempt to use as many as possible to form a Scrabble-like grid of words.

Great early word game for kids.  When I play with my 8 yr. old, he's allowed to make words that don't connect into a crossword pattern and is also allowed 2 letter words while I am not.  This helps even things out a bit.

A fast, light wordgame. Not balanced per se - poor tile draws can be a real handicap - but highly engaging and no downtime whatsoever. Great while waiting for other folks to show up. Fantastic at what it is; rated a 7 only because I tend to like more heavyweight games.

If you like this game, but wish there were a bit more to it, check out [gameid=12136], which has a similar everyone-builds-at-once dynamic but is balanced and involves scoring words (rather than "who finishes first").

RATING: 4
Components: Nice tiles. The 'N' and the 'Z' look too similar.

Experience: I like the flexibility of rearranging my words to accommodate new tiles. Sometimes, if I'm unable to play a tile, I find myself hoping that another player calls Peel. The penalty for misspelling a word is way too severe, especially since that losing player must now sit out while all of their tiles are played out by the remaining players.

I hate this game. Standard play is meaningless because it all comes down to the last letter. Your ability to create a board is useless if you draw a bad last letter. It's really just a prolonged race to make a single word. We made house rules to reward longest word and best word, but I'd still rather just play Scrabble.

Not up for breaking your brain over a game of Scrabble?  This game is like lightning Scrabble.  The interesting part is the maintenance of momentum -- the person calling for draws can keep the game in control if he knows his two-letter words or has enough places to attach hooks... but if he loses flexibility, the other player, whith a host of letters, will have an easier time making long words and can steal the momentum.  This is more fluid a situation than it seems at first.

Fills a good niche in a game collection, especially to convert Scrabble players to *real* boardgames.

My mom always liked playing this game and so did my husband. I always thought, oh no! Another 30 minutes of losing to everyone else. Ha! 

For a bad speller like me this game never did become my favorite. However, it does have it's qualities. The crossword dynamic of this game is one of the most interesting ways I've seen a word game so far. During the game players call out when they have completed their crossword and everyone picks a new letter. When this happened I found myself so caught up in trying to figure out my own crossword adding new letters became frustrating. For some with better spelling skills and a good vocabulary this probably won't be a challenge to them.

If you have guests that you know are bad spellers I would avoid this game, unless you play with the internet or a helper, but good spellers will very much enjoy playing.

This was an interesting game that I don't think will have the love/hate crowd that scrabble does.  If you like scrabble, you will likely find this enjoyable.  If you don't like fast, speedy stressful games, this likely isn't for you.  If you hate scrabble, you may actually find this ok because in this game, it doesn't pay off as much to find the huge words as much as it does being able to quickly spell short words to get through your letter tiles.  Not bad.

A faster word game than Scrabble where all players are building word boards at the same time. Still not my favorite genre (I'm not a good speller) but WAY less painful than sitting through a game of Scrabble where you have to wait 20 minutes just to play another action. 

[15 Dec 2017] - 6.5 (3 plays)
The real-time nature of play makes the game not drag out as long as Scrabble but also means that players are going to shoot for a lot more short words and eat up vowels quicker. It can be tough to teach as you need to work on your own game while also being attentive to help the new player understand what they need to do. Tough to learn and compete with experienced players for the same reason.

This is a great travel game. In addition to be highly portable, it's easy to teach to people. In general, I've found it to be well-balanced, such that the end of games are usually pretty close even when playing with a variety of experience levels. This is a big help when playing with new and random people, as they can usually win or come close after a couple of plays.

This is fun because it is fast and it is very portable.  The only thing I don't like about it is that the pace gets so frenetic that it is easy for someone to accidentally (or not) miss a peel opportunity with many quick "peels" being called in a row.  It's also impossible to keep someone from yelling "peel" when all they really want to do is get an extra tile from the bunch to aid in making a word.  Lots of fun though when playing with honest people.

This is the same game as the public domain game known as "Take One", "Speed Scrabble", "Mennonite Scrabble" and the published versions known as:
"Take Two", "Syzygy", and several others.

I'm torn about this game.  On the one hand, I love the game!  It was always one of my favorite childhood games.  On the other hand, Bananagrams published it before our company did and that makes me very mad.

Our family called it "Take one" and we used Scrabble tiles to play.  I've heard other families call it "Mennonite Scrabble" and "Speed Scrabble".  The basic concept is that everyone gets 15 - 20 letter tiles, and creates a Scrabble style crossword as quickly as possible.  The rest of the tiles are placed face down in the middle of the table.  As soon as anyone has used all of their letter tiles, they yell "take one!" (or in this case they yell "Peel").  Everyone grabs another tile from the center of the table to add into their crossword.  This continues until there are not enough tiles for everyone to grab.  At this point, the player you yelled "take one" (or "bananas") is the winner.

The game is a lot of fun.  There are elements of speed and strategy.  Having a large vocabulary is helpful, but not essential.  

Every since I started talking about starting a board game company as a senior in high school (in 1986), all of my relatives have hounded me about publishing "Take One".  I've heard about it at least 50 times.  But Take Two! and Syzygy beat me to the punch and the games did not seem to do very well.  Then Bananagrams put it in awesome packaging and did a great job with the business side and it's a run-away hit.  Why didn't I think of that?!!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
As they come out of the box...errr....the banana....the rules are rather lame. As others have pointed out, by making the entire hand revolve around the first person to get rid of all their tiles once the draw pile (bunch) is exhausted means that the player who makes most words or uses most letters can be ambushed right at the end. Judged purely on this I would only rate Bananagrams a 3 or 4.

However when viewed simply as a kit to allow you to play boardless word games it's a great product and worth the purchase price. 

We play a points variant - 1 pt for every three 'Peels' you achieve during the hand (use a stack of tokens to keep track); 1 pt for each 4 letter (or longer) word you have in your final grid; 2 pts for first person to go 'Bananas'; 2 pts for the player who makes the longest word. Starting number of tiles as per game rules but we play that the player that 'Peels' draws 2 tiles and all the other players only draw 1. Highest score after an agreed number of hands is the winner. We also verify the 'Peel'ers words before we draw.

Works great - rating based on this variant.

There's not too much to say about this. There's a slow narrative-ramping up to the abrupt ending. Make sure to dump your bad tiles in an opponent's area.

The success of Bananagrams is beyond dispute, but I've never quite understood why its "creator" is given so many kudos.  A lot of hard work went into publishing and packaging it, but the idea of the gameplay is hardly new.  

I was already introduced to "Speed Scrabble" or "[url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrabble_variants#Take_Two]Take Two[/url]" many years ago as a child, and various published versions have appeared over the years, including [gameid=4975] (1993) and [gameid=601] (1996).  

Like Bananagrams, each has a slightly different tile distribution than Scrabble, and slightly different rules.  But given the existence of these other games, Bananagrams is hardly something innovative, despite giving the game its own flavour.  

Full credit to the family for what they've achieved as publishers, but surely no history of Bananagrams is complete without acknowledging that the core idea isn't at all original.

Could it be a better version of Scrabble? It certainly takes care of the slow pace, analysis paralysis, and claustrophobia of late stage Monopoly.

Scrabble on speed but with none of the recognition that letters like Q, J and Z are somewhat harder to use than others.  Fortunately games are over quickly.  I can see the appeal of this but its not really a game for me.  I can see the appeal for family groups - quick to learn, simple (if not always easy) concept in play and over quickly.

RATING: 8
A real challenge, well worth playing especially if you don't enjoy Scrabble. The total lack of points and the very open game-play makes this a great speed game. And games are very fast, much more than you'd expect from the rules. Each round was only a few minutes, five minutes at most. Very high re-play value, though adults would beat most kids easily of course. I definitely want a copy or two. ** We got copies for Beyond Monopoly! and it is a huge hit. 8 people playing at once and everyone wanted to play it again and again.

I love word games and I love games that I can play with any group of people. Bananagrams is definitely a member of both of these categories. It scales well, it's quick, and it's easy to pick up. I love using this to start a game night as we can play until everyone arrives and people who show up mid-round don't have to wait long to join in.

A fun, lightweight game that's easy to carry around, and anyone can play. The type of game where, most of the time when you play it, it's just for fun and you don't really care who wins or if words are made up, which is nice sometimes. I've played with some more serious people that really know their words, so it seems like they enjoy it as well at a higher level. Great replay value, and definitely a game you could teach a 8 year old or grandma.

RATING: 8
Just an excellent game for what it is. You've got more control over your words than you would in games like Scrabble, Boggle, etc.  The game moves quickly and there are agonizing decisions to be made: when you pick up a new letter, do you disassemble your precious words, or hope to fit it somewhere quickly?  And there's tension, too, especially if the other player (in my case, my word-game-guru wife) is flying along, calling for you to keep picking up more and more tiles as you fall further and further behind. And even losing is fun--when the game's over, you get to admire each other's words.

Short, fast, easy to teach, challenging, addicting, and ultra-portable, Bananagrams is the ultimate Sunday-morning game to enjoy with a cup of coffee and the radio playing. Also makes a perfect lunchtime filler.

We bought this for my brother-in-law from a strong Scrabble background. Then we bought ourselves a copy. It's the fun anagramming of Scrabble but with a stressful realtime aspect. I do not like double-solitaire or dutch-blitz because I get flustered, but I enjoyed this. Particularly fun with the youngins when they hunt for dirty words (e.g. bum). I am willing to tolerate the pasted-on fruit theme.

I enjoyed Bananagrams when I first got it, but I find it rather tiring now having to create a bunch of words in a race. Having to break stuff apart to fit new words is a pain, and the 'dump' penalty most of the time isn't a penalty at all as it opens up more options. In fact, the 'peel' is the most frustrating- trying to fit one letter into your crossword after you carefully put everything together. Bananagrams isn't a bad game and I can see why I liked it when I got it. But I can't imagine wanting to play it again. There's better racing games out there that are a lot more fun. What I once thought was 'fun' now just feels frustrating. And not the good frustrating.

A favourite in my household. So simple, so portable, and easy for anyone to grasp. My partner and I play it pretty regularly so we generally don't allow two letter words and sometimes, if we want more of a challenge, will play with a 'no 2 or 3 letter words' rule. I can see this also being a great game to play with kids to enhance their spelling and vocabulary. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys word games.

While it could be called a cross between boggle and scrabble, it is really speed scrabble with no points.

In its favor, banagrams has very nice tiles, is simple to teach and plays quite fast.

However, since there are no points, getting stuck with letters like q or x are really penalties. And, as the draw pile shrinks, someone will get stuck with them.

I liked the idea of the game more than the execution. Players race to create a crossword layout using all of their initial tiles. More tiles are added gradually, and the first to have a complete grid when all tiles are gone wins the round.

It's light and quick, but the letter distribution is strange. Also, it is very much a solitaire puzzle game, and not interactive.

We used to play this game using scrabble tiles in college and though this game is an improvement, as before, I'm still not that keen on playing it.  Namely because the game rewards efficiency over creativity.  If instead, people scored based on the length of their words, maybe scoring more points for using letters that are more challenging to use (like scrabble) or something along those lines, I'd like to play this more.

I never left a comment on this game after my plays, so it has been a while since I've actually played this game.  It's a fun game, sort of a quick-Scrabble where you can rely more on creativity than board manipulation.  You have more freedom to use letters and the sometimes frantic pace of the game is a very interesting variant.

On the downside, there isn't much depth to the game.  After a few rounds of this, you'll probably want to get something different out since it lacks longevity.

A fun word game.  It is one of the only games that my wife will play with me, so it gets played more than most games!  She usually wins, which is great because I feel challenged and she doesn't get the hump.  (Perhaps this situation encapsulates the divide between "gamers" and "non-gamers"...  Or perhaps it indicates that I am a chauvinist - you decide!)

Actually, that is one of the things that I like in games - the ability for someone better than you to pull of repeat victories.  I take no pleasure from winning or loosing to chance.  But I digress.  Despite my score, I would describe this as a "gem" that should be in every collection.

Easy to teach, easy to set up, easy to pick up.  Short enough that it can be played as filler or while waiting for the rest of the gaming crew to show up.  All that and it's actually fun to play as well.  Games with 5 or more are much shorter since there are so many fewer letters, and there's less incentive to try to use problematic letters because you're less likely to get them again after you throw them back.  Most interesting with 3 or 4.

I enjoy Bananagrams, but sometimes the quick playtime keeps the game on the table longer than I'd like.

It's the faster, better, more satisfying version of Scrabble.

The thing that really kills Scrabble for me is the amount of luck in drawing certain tile configurations at the right moment, and the variation in scoring even with not-so-impressive words. Bananagrams solves both of those problems by shifting the goal of the game to just being able to utilize the tiles you have, however possible. Games are tense and highly contested. I really like how you are never out of the game even if you're struggling to put your tiles together and everyone else keeps calling to peel. All it takes is that one "eureka!" moment to be able to piece everything together. 

I feel the game is both friendly to those that have trouble with vocabulary, as well as satisfying to those that pride themselves on their lexicon. There is no reason to play Scrabble with Bananagrams as an option.

The added dexterity element may enable a swift player to beat a more knowledgeable player, but dexterity is also an uncontested-skill, so the playing field has twice the potential for being uneven.

Another version of "Take Two" or "Pick Two". 

Great word game that can be played with Scrabble tiles. Glad I found this as my Mom LOVES Scrabble and we like it to but the downtime is a killer at times as is the game length. With this game you get lots of the same flavour without those issues. 

Not sure yet but might go with this version of only making people pick one tile when someone runs out of the letters and maybe the person that ran out picks two? 

Also another variant, everyone builds the SAME board instead of all different ones, surprised this was not an official variant anywhere I looked. 

[u]UPDATE:[/u] Just played a GREAT home-made version of this which I would rate an 8. I kind of cooked it up as we were trying all the different ones I printed out and it turned out excellent, we played about 10 times in a row and everyone loved it.  Thread here:  http://boardgamegeek.com/article/5551939#5551939

With 4 players turn all Scrabble tiles face down, then each player take 10 tiles. Then someone say GO and everyone turn over their tiles and try to build their own crossword. When someone finally finishes they say "DONE" and they get -1 to their final score. Now ALL players pick FOUR more tiles and once again try to have all letters used. 

This continues until the tiles are gone, whoever finishes first in the last round gets -3 to their score. 

Scoring:  Each word is +3 to score and each unused tile is +2 to score. LONGEST word is -4, if tied look at next longest. Lowest score is the winner.  

There is more than one strategy here. Fast and furious can win but also just making long words and as few as possible can win too, some push your luck with this one though. I seen games won where the person had 8 tiles left over but only had 3 words and ended up with the longest word and won the game.  Played this way the game is addicting.

Bananagrams feels more like an educational activity set with a game tacked on to it. There is minimal interaction - while the competitive racing rules are the standard rules, it feels like it was originally created as a learning tool. I'd certainly recommend it for kids and students, but for adults - there are plenty of other word games that actually challenge players to come up with words within the constraints of the game.

This is a nice word game in which players get letetrs and make a cross word puzzle.  In the end, this game is about making flexible words using letters that can easily be interchagned as new letters come into play for your crossword.  There is very little interaction with other players as each player uses their own puzzle and only gets new tiles when one player has used all of their letters.  This is an interesting word game, but it is not overly challanging and generally plays like multiplayer solitaire.

Very good word game filler with a simple and easy-to-understand rule set.  Despite its making the rounds of hobby sites and game stores, this seems like it would work out better with a party-game crowd, as one's more likely to run across Scrabble/Boggle players in the party game set.

I understand the banana package is marketing and I won't downrate the game for it, but the theme, such as it is, is annoying.  There's no inherent association between fruit and anagramming.

I am a fan of word games. When inventing this game, someone must have said, "How can we make a simple scrabble-like game without all the bothersome scoring and interesting spacial jockeying?" 

I think this "game" is designed for people who like word puzzles but don't like games. Two player games would always seem to boil down to who could play the last tile or two the fastest. It's not entirely un-fun if you like playing with words. I also know that technically this is a game, but only by the broadest definition.

Bananagrams is basically a boardless Scrabble with simultaneous actions and a race against time, or at least each other. Enjoyment is likely entirely dependent on the word skills and vocabularies of the players. The more even the players are, the more fun it will be.

This takes the things I hate about timed scrabble and combines them into one irritating game. Not a fan of games that put a premium on speed, and the lack of a viable challenge mechanism that happens BEFORE the game is over means if you won but have a word that doesn't pass muster, you can have situations where no one wins. Maybe the rules explainer had it wrong, but that seems intensely annoying.

A decent little word game, that I much prefer to Scrabble.  Basically multiplayer solitaire, other than having to draw more tiles when another player uses all of theirs.  My biggest pet peeve in this game is that you can be in the "lead" for almost the whole game (i.e. have used all your tiles), and yet be screwed by a bad tile drawn right at the end (not unlike Carcassonne, natch).  I suppose for some this may provide tension, but for me it's not the best kind of tension.

It's got the word-nerd factor of Scrabble but takes 1/10th the time. The only problem I have with it is that other than making others draw a tile once in a while, there is very little player interaction. There should be a selling/trading aspect like Pit where players shout out what letters they have and trade with other players at great speeds.

Bananagrams is basically speed scrabble. It’s very easy to teach, accessible, very fast, scales well from 2-8 players (though it does get REALLY fast with 7-8 players), and there is a nice balance of luck and skill determining the winner. It’s exactly what I want out of a word game and I’d recommend this game to just about anyone.

The goal is basically to use up letter tiles in a scrabble-like grid as rapidly as possible. More skilled players will have the best chance at winning but after a couple of games of practice, most people will have a shot with a little luck. The luck is in what tiles each player draws. However, the ability to cache in a hard one for three more random tiles also gives the players some control, adds some tactical considerations to the mix, and even creates a little game within the game of trying to watch where people are placing their reject tiles to try and avoid drawing them later :)

Another cool feature of this game is that the challenge level and duration are very customizable. You can go with default rules or increase the difficulty (and duration) by tweaking the required minimum word length, making all words conform to a theme, or any other arbitrary constraint you come up with. This also provides a way to handicap a significantly stronger player if needed (by giving extra constraints to them).

OK game to take with you on the road or carry around with you if you're looking for a game for that. Nothing more than a filler, and won't appeal to any of your non-word savvy friends. You can definitely do much better, but if there was no other games around I would easily play this.

[size=12][b]Why I dislike Bananagrams:[/b][/size]
- The game is flawed because the winner of the game is the first person to place all of their words so you can just wait until the end of the game. 
- The game would be better with scoring based on the number of words formed, the letters used, etc.
- The replayability could be better. I find other board games like Codenames more interesting.

Significantly lighter, quicker Scrabble-like game. It's not deliberative, there's no tactics or strategy to speak of, which makes it rather light compared to Scrabble. But it is fun, due to the pressure to get things done quickly.

The rules could benefit from some tweaking: A bit too punishing about getting a word wrong at the end game, and too forgiving about getting a word wrong until the end game.

This game is very much like pick two or take two but the tiles come in a bag shaped like a banana and nicer tiles.  The main difference is that everyone starts with around 15 tiles (dependent on number of players) that first must be used before someone starts calling "Peel" or "Take One".  As well, you can choose at any time to return one tile to the pool and take 3 new tiles from the common pool.

Favorite word game.  So fast.  Fixes my main problem with scrabble and other word games...slow and boring, and why do I care about trying to figure out what six-letter word will fit this space to give me a 3x bonus with these letters?  That always felt like an exercise in futility to me.

But Banagrams is so much funner.  I love constantly re-wording things and finding what words, of any words, I can make with what I have now.

One of the other things I like about it is that it feels like you're building up an actual skill by learning it.  Learning the two-letter words, the words that start with q but don't have a u, etc.  And most importantly the skill of constantly seeing what could be and re-arranging at the right time.  Gosh this game is fun.

Scrabble mixed with Nerts. Speed scrabble where you are taking tiles, making word combos out of them & when you arrange them everyone has to add a tile from the mix.

I feel like some times it's not to call "peel" until very near the end, meaning you should focus on having good options for future letters rather than actually "winning" until "winning" would make you actually win. However, it's a very fast word game that can play a wide number of players.

Speed Scrabble!  Who can place all their letters first and complete their personal Scrabble structure?  This game CAN be discouraging for people who are bad at Scrabble-type games, but I find it does an admirable job of leveling the playing field between masters and casual players.  You have to think fast and move fast, and flexibility is a must.

It's not a good feeling when someone makes you pick up five letters in a row, so that you're swimming in unplaced consonants, but then that person might pull an X, get stuck, and lose to someone else entirely. And you might win next game.  Each one only takes a few minutes, so why not play a bunch of times?

I prefer Scrabble or Upwords but this can be played in a few minutes instead of the hour or more that those games require. I've only played as a 2-player and that means an awful lot of drawing and playing tiles before the all-important endgame. A lot of luck is involved. If you happen to draw a couple of 'Q's towards the end of the game you are almost certainly going to lose. This problem will be exacerbated in a game with more players when 'Q's without 'U's are likely. Still trying to make up my mind on this one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I always have a hard time warming up to word games along with games that rely heavily on prior knowledge. Bananagrams feels more like an exercise than a game. While player actions do affect others, these actions are never strategic, they occur just as an aside while players excel or struggle on their own with the tiles they have been dealt. Beyond hearing a few exclamations of joy or despair during play I felt very disconnected to the other players until the very end of a round where we might have had a few chuckles about words people were trying to pass. This game could be just as well played solitaire without really changing much about the experience, freeing you up to do more exciting things while spending time with others.

Bananagrams is more of a race than a game per se -- there's very little player interaction, but it just doesn't matter.

Rating based on many counts of players.

Traded.

This is more of a "pure" word game in that there is zero interaction with others (no blocking a la Scrabble) and people with a bigger vocabulary or stronger spelling skills WILL be better at it. A problem is that there is no incentive to work with "harder" letters; it's almost always better to immediately dump Q, J, Z etc. and take the three letter penalty.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Its fun...but it seems that it rewards timing, not skill and as a party game people are more focused on their tiles than each other, which seems to defeat the purpose of the party game to me, but I haven't designed a game that's sold millions, so maybe they saw something I didn't.

I'm not a huge fan of word games in general, but my wife loves them. I enjoy the simultaneous play so that even though I feel like I'm terrible, I still get to be doing something with my "cats" and "dogs" while others are writing their thesis in tile letters.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
An excellent filler. It's familiarity to Scrabble makes it easy to teach, and tile quality is great. We usually play with a variant where you start with 21 tiles each, and are only allowed to Dump once. No peeling. First one to finish his tiles is the winner. It makes the game much quicker. And as it was, having to Peel one tile at a time, often time makes you have to rearrange your words, because that one new tile doesn't fit into your current scheme. Playing that way forces the leader to redo all their stuff, one tile at a time; which is super gay. The variant makes much more sense.

A glorified version of Speed Scrabble.  I like speed scrabble, so I like Bananagrams.  Great fun for casual gaming with the entire family; this is one of the few that my mother is willing to play.

Ridiculously fun screwage scrabble.  The trick to winning is panicking your opponents to flood their brains with too many loose letters whilst you plough on ahead.

In my youth I and my friends played Letra-Mix to death, and it never occurred to us that the only three gripes we had was the long idle-time for the other players when one player had to build a crossword puzzle within two minutes or so, the point calculation, and the fact that sometimes you simply could not do anything good with the letters you were given.
Bananagrams takes the basic idea of this game, simplifies it, eliminates all the above issues and creates the (for me) best word tile laying game ever. I will throw away all others I have, I think ...

Not so much a game as a polite fight. Other than calling out, and then having a draw/re-arrange of your tiles, there's not much interaction between players. In fact, if you're going to do well, you can't look at the other participants because all of your focus is on the matrix of words in front of you.

It went down well with people who've no broad experience of board games, but after one play I felt it a bit empty to me. Most liked it, so we continued because that's what you do. Four plays, one day. I'll not play again unless someone brings it to the table and everyone else thinks it's a good idea, in which case I won't grinch. Better a mediocre game than no game.

Very high component quality - the tiles are like smooth Scrabble tile, but made of a bakelite-like material.

RATING: 4.5
Game in a Nutshell: Grab random letter tiles and race to build a crossword format using all the tiles. Use them all? Now shout it out and everyone grabs another tile.

Played as: 7 player

Pros: Quick, easy to explain, can scale well for a number of players, and has a nice familiar aura to it that shouldn't chase the non-hardcore gamers away. Tiles are sturdy and you've gotta love the banana bag.

Cons: Luck of the draw can really suck sometimes. The winner is generally going to be the person who got plenty of vowels. Some players will want to play repeatedly and I think it gets stale after 15 minutes tops.

Other: I should be noted this game can be just as easily played with a bag of Scrabble tiles. I have way more plays of this game that way then is listed here.

Best Use: Decent filler that plays no longer then you need it to.

01/08/2013:  A fun word game where you build your own crossword so to speak or your own scrabble play area.  It's very portable.  It scales well to different player counts.  The tiles are nice.  If you like words games/puzzles, it's an easy choice to pick up.

I had played [gameid=4975] long ago and enjoyed it.  However, I found that like most word games this one is really only competitive with people of the same level as you.  I have a good vocabularly but I'm not quick at making words.  In word games it's very difficult to get better quickly.  So there are certain people who are always going to smoke me in this game.  

On the flipside, if you're not too competitive and like making words I'd recommend it.  Probably a good game for younger crowds too.  I think I would have loved this between age 10-16.

Bananagrams is essentially the same game as [gameid=4975]; yes, I'm rating it epsilon higher because it comes in a banana. I'm fairly consistent about this across my ratings. As with Pick Two, would rather play [gameid=1293], although I'll smoke you at either. Scrabble, not so much.

My wife and I enjoy word games, but this one doesn't do it for me. It's actually not bad at first, but the end game can be kind of abrupt and anticlimactic. You have to be the first to get rid of your tiles. But this means you could make the longest words, the most interesting words, use the most letters, and all that fun stuff, and still lose if you end up with some odd letter or two that just won't place and someone else has an S or something like that. This has happened more often than I'd like, including the last time we played it a few days ago, and now I'm just not interested anymore. I know, I know, those may be things that other people *like* about the game. Fair enough. For me though, it's a 5/10.

I'll still play it (and just about anything) if my girls ask me to, but it's not something I vote for anymore.

My mother loves this game. It's a sort of Scrabble without the silly bonus scoring shenanigans. Plus the bag looks JUST like a banana.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A fast and fun simultaneous word-building romp: very much a "hey, let's play another" sort of game. As in [i]Scrabble[/i], a good knowledge of two- and three-letter words helps a lot. I dislike pseudo-words like "qi" and "za," but since speed is of the essence, I've used them gladly in this game.

An attractive feature of [i]Bananagrams[/i] is that it works well as a solo pastime. While you don't have to play for speed, adding every letter tile to your grid in less than a half-hour is a challenging goal: I finally did it (28:13) on my tenth try, after several times in the low 30s. [42 plays]

banangrams is a great game. think of scrabble minus any downtime and a living board. it can be played in a short amount of time, and if you want to make it harder you can create arbitrary rules about the words used (words at least 5 letters / words of a particular theme / etc). by far my favorite word game, but you can't play it too many times in a row because then the words that people used in previous games get recycled and it isn't as exciting.

Seriously love this game.  Sort of like speed scrabble but better because you don't have to lay only one word at a time, and you have access to many more letters so longer words can be made.  Then there is the moment(s) when you realize you must tear apart what you've already done to accommodate the new letters- when and how you go about that is a critical part of the strategy as well. The pressure at the end of the game is really intense!

A silly word game where everyone is building their own completed scrabble board.  As you complete all the tiles you own you pull more, and at the same time, force your opponents to pull more tiles and mess with their flow.  Unfortunately this is where the game falls apart.  

The person that starts pulling ahead is usually going to win, and once you complete that initial scrabble board the fun also drifts away.  Still fun to play in the beginning stages for a party of non-gamers.

The regular rules are functionally broken, and therefore a 1 rating is deserved.  Given that the rules don't reward the number of words formed but rather the timing (first player to "go out" after the pool is emptied), it makes the most sense to find a solution for your first 21 tiles and then sit there letting your opponent drain the pool. Then, at the correct moment, place all your words at once and win the game.

An interesting diversion.

Verdict:

What I Like: The actual activity of creatively constructing and connecting words. 

What I Don't Like: Random. The dominant strategy is to hold on to an easy to use letter and never yell "peel". Hopefully you won't get the "q" in the end or have set up for it in advance if you do.

A good game that I feel is superior to Srabble due to the quickly changing "board" and continuous interaction - you're working with your own letters to make words and don't have to sit there forever while someone with AP stalls out like in Scrabble. In addition, because you are only dealing with your own letters and words, there's less of a chance that someone will rock your world with a triple letter score or something. 

Not for people who aren't quick on their feet, especially when one person has used up their initial letters and keeps yelling "Peel!", but you get faster with practice. I'll take this over Scrabble any day.

Essentially a solitaire crossword building exercise where you get letters added to your collection at random times if other players are completing faster than you, or you're driving the pace for others. For those who love Scrabble and Boggle. This gives more control over your word building but keeps the pressure on by making it a race. With anywhere near evenly matched players the result generally comes down to who picks up easy to play tiles in the last few pickups, so it's more of a pastime than a game, but enjoyable in a puzzle type way.

Far better than scrabble. The winning condition (first to go out) doesn't really seem fair (based on one play). Really gets your brain working as you look for ways to modify what you have already constructed.

Cute game - a fun frantic few minutes. I'd recommend deciding what 'words' are beforehand, in particular letter names. 'Xi', for example, is very useful. I imagine the game wouldn't be any good against a scrabble player who knows all of the 2- and 3- letter words, but I haven't tried.

House rules: No two letter words, and when `peel' is called, everyone draws three tiles, not just one. This moves the game a little away from "where can I jam this tile" and towards actually thinking of words.

You don't have to be a genius at English either - I am certainly not, yet have won quite a few games.

This can be a fun filler game, or even a game to play while camping.  But strategy is minimal.  And I don't care that the winner is merely the player to get rid of his or her last tile.  I think scoring should also include whoever calls "peel" throughout the game.

Better than Scrabble, unless you're a big-time scrabble expert who views it as a game of area control. Then this is a cheap imitation. But for anyone who doesn't care about tournament Scrabble, this game is a definite improvement.

RATING: 6
Two player version of the game is tedious. I'd like to try it with at least four.

Honestly, if you're two and stuck with this game, play [gameid=7451] instead. Both games use the same number of tiles, and Jarnac takes up far less space!

(FYI, the current version of Jarnac published by Blackrock Editions uses cardboard tiles. I really want a copy of Bananagrams to replace those tiles!)

I'd also like to try [gameid=4975] instead of this; I prefer the idea that you're rewarded for using difficult letters (compared to Bananagrams in which the only goal is to use up all your letters).

 A tile/word game that seems to explore the idea of build/destroy/build. I like it, it's not a first pick, but the rearranging that you can do is an interesting take. Being able to continually challenge yourself with new layouts actually keeps me thinking about the game after i am done playing.

I was having a fun time playing the game and I very suprised at how much I enjoyed putting the letters together.  But another player, who had been struggling the whole game with getting anything finally got his initial tiles to work just as we started running out tiles and he wins.  It put such a bad taste in my mouth that I never care to play again.  I don't have a big thing about winning, but it seems that the real strategy in the game has nothing to do with getting lots of good letters out there, but rather to get close to winning and just wait until the tiles run down to finish.  Very broken and against what should be the spirit of the game.  I would love this game if it had a better rule set.

An example of a game that is absolutely multiplayer solitaire. The only thing you can do is dump terrible letters and hope someone else picks one up, the rest of the time you're just frantically scrambling to use all your tiles. Games seldom take more than five minutes, and it's fun to see the grids people create with their letters. In one game I had "avarice" turn into "avaricious" which then transformed into "avariciously." You can't do that in Scrabble!

The original game is fun, but you can play a variety of word games with these tiles, including the original Anagrams game. Unlike Scrabble tiles, they do not have point values, which makes the thick Bakelite-like tiles more aesthetically pleasing. Worth the online price just to have the letters for puzzle solving or recreational anagramming.

Bananagrams = Fast-Scrabble! Anytime you can get everyone doing something at the same time (zero downtime) can make for a lot of fun. We like to add rules after each round. (For instance, in order to win the following round you must have 1 word that matches the theme that the winner comes up with. i.e. Colors, Animals, Things on the beach)

It's a fun word game.  A fun variant I play with my friends makes it more interactive.  You place all the tiles facedown and go around the circle flipping them over one by one.  As you see words appear, you say the word and take the tiles.  They must start as 3 letter words.  If someone sees a letter or letters that can make a new word from your word, they say that word and steal the word from you.  You can't steal a word by adding an s, er, ly, etc...  The game is over when the tiles are gone and whoever has the most words wins.

A light, fun game. Basically, you're playing a real-time game of Scrabble without the tile scoring. Your goal is just to form all of your letters into words before anyone else does. The length/composition of your words do not matter.
Do not recommend for those who don't perform well under pressure or do not enjoy word games.

A quicker and easier version of Scrabble, that isn't a terrible filler if I'm in the mood to play a word game. The frenetic pace is kind of fun, but it often feels like one player is constantly the one "peeling" and every other player just gets further and further behind. I wouldn't turn down a game if someone really wanted to play, but it would never be my recommendation to play.

I love this game, it is my favourite language game. 

I already really like simultaneous action games.  I enjoy Scrabble already, but that game is more about searching for ideal placements for triple word scores.  Bananagrams is more about fast action fun.

I got this game in on a trade and I think it's a keeper forever. :)

A fun, fast crossword-style word game. But don't play it with someone with much better skill level ... it's not nearly as much fun!

All the letter tiles are mixed up face down. Then each player takes a number (e.g., 15 with 6 players). Simultaneously flip them face up, then work to put all the letters together crossword style. When you're done, yell "PEEL" and everyone takes a new tile. If you're stuck, yell "CHANGE" or something like that, put one letter back and draw 3 more to replace. Keep playing till someone yells PEEL but not everyone can draw a tile; if the PEEL player's words make sense, they win!

While this is just sort of a casual word game, I really enjoy it. Even though I'm probably the strongest Scrabble player in my group I do not always win because creating the board takes a lot of creativity and not necessarily the best memorization of useful words.

Granted, I know there are variant rules that may improve this game some but I've only played with the most basic rules and with those this is a pretty bad game.  It is essentially just Scrabble without a board and no scoring, instead it is a race to place the last tile.  Each player starts with a handful of tiles and begins making words with those tiles much like you would on a Scrabble board except you can rearrange your tiles at will.  When a player places the last of their available tiles they announce "Peel!" and everyone grabs a new tile.  This goes on until the final tile is placed and whoever placed it is the winner.

I feel like the game assumes that by playing all your tiles you can go through the bag while filling your opponents stock with tiles they can't play as quickly.  Except the first time you play you quickly realize that having a single tile isn't always as easy to play as a handful.  Plus the game gives you the ability to ditch a tile at any time and trade it in for 3 more.  It's just a nonsensical game where just happening to play the last tile wins you the game by a fraction of a second each time.

Even the argument that it is more portable than an actual game of Scrabble doesn't really hold water nowadays.  Not only does actually playing this game take up much more room than a Scrabble board would, even if you consider just carrying around the pouch of tiles, we live in the age of smartphones, just download Scrabble on your device and play on the go.

RATING: 7.5
I am not a fan of scrabble and word games in general, but love this game! Unlike scrabble where everyone plays on the same board, here everyone plays on their own and it is a race to see who can use up all their letters first. In addition, at any time, you can start over ie. you can undo all the words you already made and start from scratch (you are still stuck with the same letters though). This feature makes this game much more friendly to people who are not a fan of scrabble.

Bananagrams is never at the top of my list of games I want to play, but if someone is dying to bring it to the table, I'll usually play one round. It's a bit too hectic for my tastes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Components: :star::star::star::star::star: Tiles are good quality and well printed. Banana zip-pouch is well made and very easy to throw into a backpack or picnic basket.

Art: N/A - letters printed on tiles (think scrabble)

Rules: :star::star::star::halfstar::nostar: Straight forward rules, easy to follow, although remembering the banana associated words for each action can sometimes be frustrating. We use standard words such as 'draw' 'swap' 'finished' instead.

Gameplay: :star::star::star::halfstar::nostar: Gets quite frantic and can bring ou the competitive nature in people. Its a race to use up the tiles first so don't worry about using big words.

Player Interaction: :star::star::halfstar::nostar::nostar: very little player interaction as you focus on your own letter tableau - occasional cursing at each other if one player causes the others to draw too quickly.

General Comment:
Basically a racing game as you try to use letter tiles to create a crossword in front of you. Because letters don't have point values the aim is to be the first to finish rather than have the 'best words'. Once all of your letters a=have been used you draw a new one, as do ALL other players, regardless of if they are ready or not. You can get quite a decent run going by using 3-4 letter words at first, forcing the other players to continue adding new tiles to their hand as every needs to draw a new tile at the same time.

Would I buy again if lost/damaged beyond playability:
:thumbsup::thumbsup::thumbsup::thumbsup: Sure would, my wife and my mother both enjoy this one. Its also a useful classroom game to help kids with vocabulary and spelling. Worth keeping.

Bananagrams is a perennial favourite multi-solitaire word tile game where you compete to create your own 'crossword' tableau in real time. Vocabulary building, dexterity and quick play time combine to make this really good for family play.

I enjoy Bananagrams more than most word games. A large vocabulary isn't as necessary, making it a better game to play with kids. Even my (literate) 4yo likes to use the tiles to make words, so I can play a modified version with him.

I love its portability and speed of play. The banana packaging is very cute (although not as easy to stack on the game shelf). As an added bonus, it works great as a solitaire game as well.

Okay, it's just like Pick Two except: 1) You only Pick One. 2) You can trade in a bad tile, 1 for 3 new tiles. 3) Each round is a game, so you don't waste time keeping score.  The ergonomics and the cuteness factor are a little better in Bananagrams, too.

Played once as a 2-player game. At first, felt kind of weird to just keep taking tiles and building words quickly at first...almost felt pointless (plus I was a little tired after already playing a couple of other games). However, as it got closer to the end, I hit my stride and was able to 'peel' several times and almost get the jump on my competitor...it was quite exciting. I might have won if my last letter hadn't been a 'Q' with no letters left to draw from (i.e. no dumping). It turned out to be more fun than I thought!

This is the perfect travel game in the sense that it is small, waterproof, windproof, has a reasonable playing footprint, plays quickly, scales well from 2-? and any English speaker can enjoy it.

This is likely my second most played game of all time (cribbage is the most), but it is for the reasons described above and my Mom and wife love it.

I have grown a bit tired of it after probably 200+ plays. It feels strange to knock a game you've played that much and will play probably that many times more.  It is just so easy to get to the table that it gets played.

I am happy that I own it and should it ever become lost I will definitely replace it.  That probably says a lot right there.



Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 5
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 5
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 5
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 5


Overall - 5 THE ULTIMATE TRAVEL GAME, it's pretty small, smaller footprint, scales perfectly from 2-8 and as a bonus the components are water-proof, wind-proof and cannot be damaged.

Scrabble without the board. And that's not a bad thing. 

It's also Scrabble without all the variable letter-score-number and bonus point multiplier spaces. I like that; it removes some of point-hording-psychosis that Scrabble tournament types are so good at and takes the game back to a place that is more pure--about letters and making as many words as you can, not who can find and remember the spelling for the most obscure (but highest scoring) words in the English language.

Despite owning this game for years and at one time having multiple copies, I had never played it before now. It's a fairly straightforward word game. You start with a bunch of tiles and you have to create a scrabble/crossword grid of valid words. If you do, everyone draws a new tile. Then you have to change things so that all your letters again make words, when you again trigger a new tile for all players. You keep repeating this until there are fewer tiles to draw than players. Whichever person made their words at that point wins.

The game rewards players who are flexible and can find ways to repurpose/recreate/rearrange words efficiently. If other players are able to quickly fit new letters into existing words, you can have an avalanche of tiles coming your way, leaving you way behind in making your words work.

The game was fun, although I was playing against my son, so I had a clear advantage. Whether it would be fun playing against a competitive wordsmith isn't clear. The best scenario is probably playing with someone who is neither particularly better or worse at making words than you.

A super-quick word game that encourages a ton of plays in a row. It's not uncommon, however, for one or two people to pretty much dominate an entire session. It's also very easy to do solitaire play, although not necessarily by the given rules - I like taking 21 tiles and making my own grid with as few words as possible. I also strongly encourage the "no 2-letter words" rule. Heck, sometimes I want to play with a "4+ letters only" rule, but I haven't gotten a group to agree with that yet.

Let me preface this by saying, I'm a sucker for word games.  There is no time of day I won't jump at the chance to play this game. It's like a quick brain warm up when you're feeling slow. I'm certain my husband wishes it would rot into non-existence, just like a real banana (but woo! it won't) :)

A fun, scrabble type crossword, speed game.  It is fun, but there is a fatal flaw in the main 'peel' type version of the game as you start with 21 tiles and as soon as you use them all, you call "peel."  everyone playing takes a new tile until there are no more tiles and whoever uses the last one wins.  One can just wait 'in hiding' while everyone else says 'peel.'  Then at the last second can still win by using all their letters before anyone else.  While the whole game never calling 'peel.'  The other games are fun, but this game needs the right people to have fun.

God, what an awful game. If I wanted to play a word game, I would much rather play scrabble. The game is a tedious process of arranging and then rearranging letters. To top it off, it is possible to win the game by turtling, waiting for the last moment by holding on to tiles and not playing them even though you have the words in mind. Basically a boring, solitaire game that still manages to make it to the popular market. How the hell that happens is beyond me.

Good for a word game, though such games are definitely not my cup of tea.  The weakness that usually plagues word games is present here -- if you have a better vocabulary, you are much more likely to win.  I do like that this both plays faster than [gameid=320] and also takes away the silly scoring that leads to counterintuitive play.  It makes for more entertaining light play by sacrificing some of the depth.  It's worth playing for the word game crowd.

Rating more reflects my personal feelings, more than the game. I'm not a fan of speed/dexterity games, nor word games. Combining the two wasn't going to improve things. Decent game if you're into that sort of thing.

(1/10)  Had played this once before in 2008 maybe with real experienced players in a 3p game and did not have fun as they "peeled" and "dumped" to quick victories while I had a stack of unused letters.   After a game in which we all learned it at the same time - we had a blast and were very evenly matched.  Good fun if you like word games.

[b]Summary:[/b]
+ Fast, instantly learnable, fun for people who like words, deciphering patterns, and organizing.
- Impossible for slow players and poor spellers. Game ends quickly.

Much better than Scrabble. This has long been one of my family's go-to party games, though it's horrible for some players who can't keep up. It's so short that it's easy to just move on.

[b]Rules: [/b]
Understandable in about two minutes.

[b]Components: [/b]
Exactly what they should be. It's just letter tiles like in Scrabble.

[b]Theme:[/b]
There's a banana bag for some reason. No theme.

[b]Luck: [/b]
Mitigated easily, but luck of the draw is fairly strong. You can replace a bad tile (like a 'Q')

[b]Interaction: [/b]
It's a race. Also, you can trade one bad tile for 3 random, unseen tiles. Other players will be stuck with your bad tile, unless you draw it again. It feels like solitaire, but subtle interaction is constant and key. Mental dexterity comparison = interaction.

[b]Strategy: [/b]
A little. You can start with long words or short words and make a plan for how to build your crossword-style layout.

[b]Tactics: [/b]
A fair amount. It's generally about where to put the tiles in front of you at the moment more than it is about your final layout.

[b]Analysis Paralysis: [/b]
Not allowed. All play is simultaneous. It's a race. However, personal AP sometimes arises when it seems impossible to play a letter or you have all vowels.

[b]Difficulty: [/b]
It's horrible for some players who can't keep up. It's so short that it's easy to just move on.

[b]Length: [/b]
A few minutes.

[b]Replayability: [/b]
Infinite. This game only gets old if you grow to dislike the gameplay, not because variety lessens.

RATING: 6
A breakneck word making game. You basically create your own crossword puzzle/scrabble board in front of yourslef with the letters you take at the beginning of the game. If someone runs out they grab from the center and everyone else must also stop what they are doing and take another letter. Usually whoever can play their initial tiles first will win.

I'm normally not hot on word games, especially those that are lengthy, that overly reward the uses of the "odd" letters and that encourage people to scour the dictionary constantly.

With that in mind, I think Bananagrams is my ideal word game.  It's a game about speed above all, which means games typically last a mere 5 minutes or even less.  All letters are treated equally (there are no "points") and the only time a dictionary gets cracked is at the end to make sure the winner didn't "cheat".

This is a good game for family gatherings as you can easily play with any group size from 2 to 10+, it can be played on any flat surface, and you can play 5 games in 30 minutes.

Personally, I'm finding that the game is more fun with a low player-count.  I think it is best with 3-4.  With 5 or more players, the raw luck of tile drawing becomes more and more impactful and making words with such a limited character count starts to feel like an uphill battle.

I'd put this a little below Boggle. Both are nice little quick word games, but I prefer boggle because it has more interaction. This is still a decent amount of fun though.

It looks more like Scrabble, but scrabble is much longer and more thoughtful, so the play of Bananagrams is quite different.

RATING: 7
This is a great alternative to Scrabble, and it's friendly to a much wider range of players.  No one is compelled to try to find the absolute highest-point words possible and you never have to worry about setting up an opponent for a triple word score.  The downside is that you can't really check the validity of the words other people are playing until the very end. 


Infinitely portable; the "banana" fits perfectly in any travel bag or even a pocket ([i]insert joke here[/i]).

Its speedy Scrabble!  Players start with a pile of letters and must build their own crossword with them.  Once out a player calls "Peel" and every player must draw another letter and re-arrange.  A player may also "dump" unwanted letters then draw three more. When every player can't draw a letter the game is done.  Its more fun than it sounds and is particularly good when you don't have enough time or too many people for Scrabble.

Aside from the weird banana-related theme, this is actually a decent Scrabble-like title that can be played in quick succession (which is also its biggest failing, because after several 6+ game sessions I've found myself burned out from it).  I like Bananagrams because you don't necessarily need a huge vocabulary to remain competitive, as speed and the ability to recognize and formulate words in sequence is far more important.  Not to mention it can accommodate as many as 8 players (while 4 is still the sweet spot, 6 didn't feel crowded at all with plenty of tiles to go around).  A surprise hit for me.

This was passed onto me by a colleague. It didn't see play in our regular gaming group because one member is dyslexic and dislikes word-based games (e.g. Scrabble). So I paid it forward to my cousins, who loved it. They played it with their mum, who LOVED it. She introduced it to my parents and aunts (all Scrabble fiends), who adored it so much they demanded their own copy. Then she took it to work (a high-stress hospital environment) and played it with her coworkers. The staff have found it the perfect way to relax whenever they can snatch a five-minute lunch break. 

Long story short: this game has passed through many hands, made a lot of people happy, and ultimately made a demanding yet vital job that little bit easier. Not bad for a humble yellow bag of alphabet tiles.

Played multiple times a day for the last 10 days and counting. I think I will stop logging the games...

I played this game just twice, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

Pocket Madness is a very simple card game with some set collection and push your luck elements to it. While the artwork and the components are really great, unfortunately I wasn't a fan of its game-play. The problem for me was that I didn't really understand what I was supposed to do, what decision I should make. Sure, the idea is to collect certain cards in order to activate special powers, but the whole thing felt impossible to control to me. I guess it's just too chaotic for my taste. 

Pocket Madness is not a bad game by any means and I'm sure it's one that many people will enjoy... just maybe not for me. I also have a very difficult taste when it comes to shorter games, because I usually prefer a conversation to a shallow game-play experience, so also that must be taken into account. Excellent artwork, but not really interested!

I've only played it as a 2p game so far, so maybe it will be better at a higher player count.

Great art, cool theme, but I haven't quite gotten into it yet.

I was expecting way more from Pocket Madness: in the end it’s just a set collection card game with a trendy Cthulhu theme pasted-on.

It works somehow and the drawings are cute too but I found no real fun or commitment while playing it.

This game gets lost with all the other "good" games. With so many "good" games coming out every year the only thing making this one stand out is the art. 

That felt strange. I feel like I just made calling a game "good" a bad thing.

Tiens ... un Cathala. Surprenant ! (Avec Ludovic Maublanc). Bon, je ne sais pas grand chose de ce jeu, si ce n'est que c'est un jeu de cartes avec pour thème Chtullu (Ça, c'est un thème permanent dans les jeux). Une sombre histoire d'activation de cartes quand on a 3 créatures identiques. Il va y avoir une soirée sur ce jeu à la triche prochainement. Une bonne occasion de le découvrir.

Pour 2 à 4 joueurs pour des parties de 30 minutes.

A fun little set collection game in which you try to make sets and clear your hand before the end of the round. The splaying of the cards is an interesting mechanism which adds some nice decisions.

The art is beautiful and the them is pretty fun. There is some depth in the game, but maybe a little bit on the light side for my tastes.

Very light set collection game - theme is a bit pasted on (it seems adding Ctulhu to games makes them more visible) but this is a quite fun filler game.

The setup is awkward and a pain, and I'm not entirely convinced the game ever ends unless people play recklessly-- at least, not in 2p, where you can reliably go out if you want to. But the art is beautiful and the shared queue of cards is fun.

This one is very simple and straight-forward:  You make up matching sets of cards to pick up "Portal" cards, in order to empty your hand, or a set of every different card to score a point, and the round ends when the deck depletes, a player depletes their hand, or a player has lost 10 points.

Un jeu vraiment très sympathique. Seule la phase de répartition des cartes à chaque début de manche est un peu laborieuse ; la mécanique, sans être originale ni remarquable, tourne parfaitement est permet quelques retournements de situation. Très agréable;

Simple card game in the same vain as rummy. The madness tokens and the incremental gains as you play runs adds a nice twist. Not one that will probably see much play but happy to have this filler in my collection. Easy to pull-out with non-gamers.

RATING: 2
Basically just a crappy variant on Rummy. My rating would normally be a little higher, but splaying out the cards is so aggravatingly difficult to do so that you can see every card that I think they should have come up with an easier way to accomplish this.

Love the theme and the artwork, but the gameplay itself is, unfortunately, unremarkable (although still entertaining for a filler game). Really wanted it to be more than it turned out to be. Fanning out the cards at the start of the game is also too much of a chore for such a quick playing game.

not a fan of the whole 17 reversed card in the deck... makes the setup for a little game so tedious.

A game of nothingness. 
5 and not less because, after all, it works. But it is completely without any interesting decisions Everything is so bland and uninteresting, i don't even feel it like a game.
It's a (very) distant parent of Abluxxen but without the fun.
+0.1 rating for the nice and funny art.

From Spiel'16.
This is a very simple game to learn with beautiful illustrations. Unfortunately, I have the impression that it doesn't click well with only two players and that, after a few plays, the game may be slightly boring.
I have to test it with 3-4 players, but I am afraid it will still be repetitive after a couple of plays.

1st play: Very similar to Kingsburg, but with a Cthulu theme on top.  The spell cards were very random, and I think detracted from the game, though they were a nice idea overall.  The buildings on the board fit the theme, but I'm not sure they were balanced, but the game was overall enjoyable.

No 2nd play, I missed the group's second play and it didn't stand out enough from Kingsport for me, the Cthulhu theme doesn't help me and I was never over compelled to want to play Kingsport either. Not a bad game just not exciting enough to pick over other games.

RATING: 7.5
This game is very interesting, I usually enjoy a lot games with dice combination mechanics and this is implemented very well. This game is not just about that, but basically. The theme is ok, Lovecraft was never a theme that I seek in boardgames, but I don't matter playing. The art is very beautiful.

Good dice worker placement game that brings some interesting decision making. While rolling high means you can get the best spots, you also go last in turn order and can lose sanity by evoking such high-powered elder gods.

RATING: 8
A better version of Kingsburg in my opinion and with a dark theme.  You are evoking the elder gods to destroy humanity using dice for worker placement.  Over all theme is great and it is definitely a better version of Kingsburg.  Mare variability with the random drawn scenario card that effects the entire game.

RATING: 8.9
Kingsburg meets Arkham Horror, from a pair of designers, one of whom was a designer on the former. As an evil cultist, you're rolling dice to invoke Elder Gods, and spreading your influence through a city to battle against Investigators who will try to stop you. Lots of theme here, like spells, various scenarios that can alter the gameplay, event cards, and a load of flavor text in the rulebook and on the cards. Excellent game, just different enough from Kingsburg, but easy enough for anyone to pick up who is familiar with how that system works.

Apparently a re-theme of Kingsburg.  I wasn't enamored with Kingsburg and I haven't played it enough to be tired of it.  This game didn't really do anything for me that made me like it better than Kingsburg.  I do think the luck of the dice is less here and the random setup cards area a good thing.  However, the Lovecraft theme is not my thing (I know very little about it) and the game just feel sort of flat for me.

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
I left this one thinking I would much rather play Kingsburg.  I think the game has some interesting ideas to expand up Kingsburg (which is obviously its foundation), but these ideas made the game less fun IMHO.  I also found the usability of the game to be awful, which also increased the length of the game.  The game was fun, but at the end of the day I see no reason to play this one over Kingsburg.

First, I don't care for the theme.
Then there is the over-the-top artwork. Players are supposed to lose their sanity, not to become blind!
The icing on the cake was the random points awarded after the game is over.
To sum it up, a classic FFG treatment of what could be a good game... I'll have to try Kingsburg.

This game is a good.  My cons with the game are a few.  
Con #1: The components.  This game is begging for a component upgrade.  The dice are colored for each player but they are just regular wooden dice.  The dice would have been much better if they were the Arkham Horror type custom dice. You signify control of an area by placing a disk of your color on the location.  These disks should have been little cultist meeples or figures (like in Madness at Midnight or Fate of the Elder God or Pandemic: Reign of Cthulhu, Defenders of the Realm).  I know it would have raised the cost but I think the game immersion suffers slightly due to these omissions. Also, the resources for Death, Destruction and Evil are Black, Red, and Purple cubes.  These should have been skull tokens, purple cthulhu tendril and token that shows flames. The game also had a very large foot print and take up a ton of table space.  The greatest con of the game would be the fact that as you gain powers by accessing different locations you will need to memorize the different abilities.  The game should have perhaps came with tokens that allow you to flip them to show that you used that power. 

Where the game shines is the art work of the Elder gods which is very nice and I like how they added some background on each God and investigator in the rule book and the back of the Elder god placard. The game has a ton of replay ability  because each game the overall festival rule changes rules and which investigator you encounter is random and there is a random event for certain rounds that also change up the game. 
There are some really great choices on how  you should proceed and I felt like the luck of the dice could be mitigated using cards.  Overall this is a really good game.  I can't compare it to Kingsburg because I have never played it.  I can say that the theme of this is clearly darker than Kingsburg.  I only played this game with 2 players (played 5 times) and I imagine it is even more tense with 4 or 5 players since you can block each other out of certain locations.

The methods of dealing with investigators are better to me than thwarting the monsters in Kingsburg also the catchup mechanic is replaced with sanity, another catchup mechanic, but one which fits the theme better. The scenario cards make for replayablity, but the festival cards are annoying at best. I like the randomness of the events, it is strange, but I think the short term effects of the events makes them interesting.

Love it, Love it, Love it. Of course if you are a Lovecraft fan this would be a must have. 
Typical gripes
1) Typeset is kind of hard to read.
2) Location tiles are not printed on the board 1/15/15. hopefully there is an expansion reason for this.
3) It could use a 2nd board for dice placement on the gods.
4) The theme is very dark. Playing as cultists that want to kill and bring Dark gods to power.

Definitely would rather have this than Kingsburg and I loved that. So happy they made this one.

This is a dice game/area management game.  The actions that you can do are based on the dice that you roll.  There's a roundel of sorts around the board with different values.  It are these values that add up in any combination of you dice that opens the actions you can perform.

A fun Lovecraft themed Kingsburg.  A game with a lot going on.  With only one playthrough under my belt, it's hard to find a solid strategy that makes sense.

Vous connaissez King's Burg? Un jeu qui a eu son petit succès dans le mode ludique. Kingsport Festival, c'est la même chose, mais mis sur le thème de Chtulhu. Vous savez, l'abominable créature à tentacules qu'on retrouve dans les jeux typés "horreur à Arkham". Bon,je n'y ai pas joué. Un tord surement mais du coup, pas evident d'en faire une description. C'est du jeu de gestion, ça, c'est sur, avec un petit thème d'horreur dessus où il faudra faire des invocations de plein de créatures pas belles. la suite ben ...

KF has some great gameplay.  It flows fast and is very easy to teach and learn.  The problem, is the graphic design.  The artwork on the cards and elder gods is great.  The rulebook is atrocious to look at and is cluttered with unnecessary lore and text along with some poor choices in font styles and colors.  The board is another issue.  The central board where all the buildings are depicted is fine.  The tracks are all over the place and jump around in color scheme.  The designs of these components are really disappointing and make me want to try Kingsburg just to have a better visual experience with similar gameplay. Although, despite these flaws, KF is a very good game and my group has enjoyed it many times.

A really good alternative to Kingsburg.  To me it feels very different to it's predecessor probably due to the theme.  I would say this is more of a gamers game out of the two.  

I wished they made the old ones cards out of thick cardboard as the card stock is poor.  Also wished they wrote the names on the front as well.  Other than that it's a fantastic game.

RATING: 7
A good re-skin of Kingsburg with a Lovecraft theme.   The large art Elder cards are really nice, but they are huge when arrayed around the board.   The board is also really big, and I'm not sure that individual player boards wouldn't still be a better idea.   It's just easier to tell what you have that way.   But, in any case, the various scenarios are a nice touch and should give some good replayability, which Kingsburg lacked.   12 rounds might be too long for some, but I see no reason why a 9-round game couldn't work just as well.   I can see this becoming the C'Thulhu game of choice.

It is very much like Kingsburg.  Dice manipulation abilities are even rarer than in Kingsburg, but without the ability to gain extra dice the board doesn't seem as crowded.

I’m not sure I get what they were going for here. Were they trying to design a more strategic Kingsburg or simply add in more layers for the sake of adding in layers? In addition to the three basic resources, now players can collect three types of bonus cards while managing two systems of currency (sanity and magic). The periodic battles against unknown enemies are preceded by unknown events. 

While it might sound good on paper, in practice adding more options to what are essentially simple decisions doesn’t equate to more depth of decisions but just more time to make what are essentially simple decisions. This result is a game that strikes me as an example of more is less. The gameplay is more sluggish and clunky while feeling even more random. You’re not just hoping for high dice rolls but for getting the better bonus cards and events that help you or at least don’t hurt you in random ways.

I also don't like the graphic design here. First, the building tiles (with their powers) are on the playing board such that you have to pick the tiles up off the board to see what their powers are. Until you've played a few times and have them memorized, you're constantly having to pick the tiles up to see what your building powers offer you. Second, the places where you place your dice are cards place around the board which means this game takes up a lot of space.

As a result, I find it both too long and too large for what it is. It strikes me as a 2004 era game, not 2014, in its design sensibilities.

Kingsport Festival is a unique blend of worker-placement, card management, and anticipation with a Cthulhu universe theme. This is a really good game, but it desperately needs an expansion or something to make it less predictable--perhaps new boards or something that mixes up the locations? It also would benefit from a good two-player variant.

Die schlechte Nachricht ist: man steht im Spiel auf der Seite des Bösen. Die gute Nachricht: der Albtraum ist nur ein Spiel. Thematisch verortet und eingedunkelt in Lovecrafts Cthulhu-Mythos summiert KINGSPORT FESTVAL Würfelworker Placement, Ressourcenmanagement, Optimierungsspiel und Kartendusel zu einem düsteren Bewältigungs-TRip, indem man vor allem nicht den Ereignissen und Ermittlern zum Opfer fallen darf, die als Stolpersteine in Intervallen auf die Spieler warten. Der permanente Blick in die grauenhaften Fratzen der Alten ist die Hölle. Tiefschwarze Symbolik durchzieht das Spiel. Eine undankbare Auftragsarbeit für jedem dem Licht zugewandten Illustrator und eine visuelle Zumutung für den Schöngeist: Tod, Übel und Zerstörung als Klötzchen und spielerische Spinnenfingerübung in der Hölle. Keine Option für das wirkliche Leben im Himmel auf Erden.

An attempt to innovate and improve on Kingsburg, which is a wonderfully solid game. Both use dice as a worker placement mechanism, in order to collect sets of goods that get you points and advantages. The main twist in this version is spell cards, which add an additional element of luck to the game. Both the spell cards, and battle with enemies take the luck element of Kingsburg to a higher level. The key to the game seems to be getting the most of the good spell cards, as those score the most points for the least effort. However, your access to them is almost completely blind --you either get the rolls necessary, or you don't. There are cards that help in other ways, but there's no draft or other mitigation, just blind draws --and you only get draws if you can get the goods or rolls needed to get draws.

This is a more random and annoying version of it's much more solid predecessor.

The front cover logo requires a sanity roll. Very nice production quality and moody artwork, but the graphic design is rough. Very hard to read the rules, let alone the fonts chosen for the cards. You pretty much have to avoid the flavor text or the explanation text in the rulebook if you wish to maintain your sanity. Still though, eager to play this one as I enjoyed Kingsburg.

Gameplay is solid, but I just don't really love it.  With all the variety of scenarios, investigators, events, and even possible Festival cards, this just left me feeling a bit too bored.  Maybe it was the way that your pieces expand across Kingsport, maybe it's the Cthulhu theme, but I just found it a bit underengaging for what it should have been.  Solid, but not as enjoyable as I feel it needs to be.  Maybe it's too long?  Maybe that would speed up with repeated plays, but I think I'm going to let this one go.

Bah! I think I can do better a game than this Kingsburg clone for an evil cultist game in Lovecraft's universe.

Like Kingsburg, it lacks depth and replayability, too much randomness (cards, dice, etc.), and is bacially boring. Especially if you compare it to other modern games and games that have the Lovecraftian universe theme like Arkham and Eldritch Horror.

The designers have no creativity at all, they just took Kingsburg and the Lovecraftian Mythos and merge them. Pity! I despise cloners.

Let's be honest: this is basically "Kingsburg" with a few changes and a Lovecraftian theme. There are some good ideas, like the cost in sanity to summon higher elder gods (advisors) and compensation for bad die rolls. The scenario cards also sound good, but they don't seem to change the game very much, and some include an annoying festival card, which gives or take away victory points for random stuff at the end of the game. Spell cards also add randomness. The theme doesn't work so well, and fighting human investigators (instead of goblins, orcs, zombies and demons) just feels lame.

What really harms the game, however, are the stupid decisions on production and graphic design, resulting in terrible functionality. In a vain attempt to distance the game from "Kingsburg", the publisher and/or the designers decided to reinvent the wheel. The buildings are now on the main board, and of course it's a pain to continuously check or remember what they do. Their power descriptions are on tokens, because it was so important for the publisher to have a language-independent board. If there were copies of these tokens for every player, that might have worked, but with only one of each, they only serve to increase setup time and hide the artwork on the board. With the addition of unnecessarily large sheets for the elder gods, the game requires a pretty big table. Not even the text was spared, with a tiny font on the cards and a horrible hard-to-read font in examples and flavor text.

On mechanics alone, it is not very inferior to "Kingsburg", but I feel that dealing with all the functionality problems may just be too much work to be worth playing, especially when I have the better game in my collection.

Uhm... the first few mins. showed me one of the worst games I've played, but it could recover a bit from there. However, I still dislike this game, as it's a worse version of an already not so great game.

First thought was "it's like playing monopoly, draw an event card and go from there..." and I still see it that way. Why on earth would I play a long and random game with enough chaos that keeps you away from any plans?

Played in a back-to-back comparison with Kingsburg.  I didn't like this one as much.  The art from the stratilibri stuff was incredible and I loved the pentagram hidden in the board.  But the components from the US publisher were absolutely dreadful!  Damn near unreadable fonts in tiny size.  Overall, I didn't feel like the cardplay added anything to the core mechanisms.  I would rather play Kingsburg again than this one, but pretty much anything else new instead of either.

I like the additions that they made to differentiate it from Kingsburg, like the spells.  The thing that hurts this game more than anything is the graphic design.  The cards representing each of the Old Ones/minions are way too big, meaning the game takes up more table space than it should.  The rule book is an eyesore and just trying to read it gives me a headache.  Clean up the design a bit and this would probably kill Kingsburg for me.

2-5 players. Dice placement. Player interaction is limited to invoking Elder Gods before other players do. Too much in-game text. Based on Kingsburg, but the theme is gloomy and the design is much worse (e.g., fonts are tiny, Elder God cards are huge, and building tiles are less readable than Kingsburg's province sheets).

A fun quick playing Cthulhu themed game with dice.  The best part is even a long run of 'poor' (i.e low) die rolls really doesn't doom the player to last place.  When playing our first game my wife rolled 7 or less on 3d6 for 5 turns straight (out of 12 rounds).  She ended up winning the dang game!  Lots of fun spells to get and cast on yourself or others.  The players expand their cults onto the board by 'breaching' the defenses of different buildings in Kingsport.  This is done by collecting resources from Mythos monsters players summon with their dies rolls to gain gifts (there are 20 different creatures to summon and deal with numbered 'X' (use any number on a die) up to 19 (yes you have to try and get 19 on 3d6! - don't worry there's a whole deck of spell cards you can get to boost your summoning dice totals).  Each area offers a unique ability your cultist can use to aid them in breaching other buildings or gaining more resources.  The only weak spot I saw was the 'raid' mechanic which seems to have too little effect in game as the raided areas can easily be avoided (and few of them offer any real incentive to try and hold them).  Certain areas a subject to raids by heroic investigators - the rulebook section that describes this process could be much clearer on where the raids take place but we eventually figured that they hit every spot that had a gun/raid symbol on it at the same time.  Defeating a raid does gain you some rewards but often you have to spend a great deal in spells to defend your self.  Overall we really enjoyed the game though and look forward to another Kingsport Festival.

Theme is extremely pasted on. Wasnt bad as such, just not interesting. The common board makes you feel less ownership of your buildings compared to Kingsburg and the spellcards, while a great idea, didnt really feel like spells. Too bad.

First Impression: This was a fun dice placement game. I would like to play Kinsburg for comparison, which at first seems a little more in line with the theme I'd like to play, but perhaps less challenging. After 1 play this is a solid 7. It could move up with another play or two, but I'm not sure that it would stay higher after 5-10 plays.

I want to play this, but I find the graphic design and art work very unappealing. Iconography lacks clarity. The rulebook has unreadable blue script and looks cluttered and over-saturated. It's very disappointing, since I love the Mythos theme.

As far as game play goes it looks like an interesting enough iteration on Kingsburg. I'm a bit concerned about the added random elements, especially the festival cards. I need to play this before considering a purchase.

I enjoyed Kingsburg very much when I played it but somehow I never bought it.

Then I learnt about Kingsport Festival coming out and I knew that this was the version that I wanted to get.

It has a very dark Cthulhu theme, keepes all the aspects of Kingsburg that I enjoyed and very efficiently mitigated the luck of the die roll by making it very costly to take advantage of your high die rolls.

Scenario and Festival cards add to the replay value and further elevate it above the Kingsburg base game.

RATING: 9
A more "gamer"-ish version of Kingsburg. Added mechanics and theme re-skinning make this a fitting and improved sequel to the original, though you likely won't want to play it with younger kids anymore. Loses a half point for very onerous setup, which, after Kingburg, they should have known better. Gifted to a friend who likes the Cthulu theme, as the much more family-friendly kingsburg hits the table more regularly.

RATING: 6
I enjoyed some of this game, but it really bogs down for me. There's some frustration with the player colors and resource colors matching, and it confuses everyone the entire game. The rulebook is hard to read and hurts the eyes with its font choices.  There are numerous clarifications not mentioned in the rulebook, which seems odd since this is Kingsburg redux. The Great Old Ones cards are hilariously oversized and take up WAY too much space.  If you want to play 2 players, you have to find some variants as there is nothing included.

For all that I want to like this game (and not having played Kingsburg) I can't focus on anything but the negatives.  I still rate it a 6 but I don't see this hitting the table much.

4 & 5 Player. Wasn't bothered with the theme. I like how the dice determine the play order and determine the gods you can select from, adding an unknown factor each round, however a low roll can really screw you over, especially later on in the game as the buildings get more expensive.

Would recommend using the random start event however would only use the end of game bonus event if if wasn't secret. Would be too brutal to determine the winner randomly.

This game needs a player aid so you can quickly see which building abilities you've activated. Near the end it was difficult to see what players had built and there were quite a few "oh I forgot to claim my x".

Kingsport Festival, a game of bizarre cults set in the terrifying world of Howard Philips Lovecraft, lasts 12 rounds, each divided into six phases. All Cultists roll their dice and the one that rolled the lowest sum will play first and so on, then (in turn order) each one may invoke an Elder God by using one or more of his dice, where the sum of their values is exactly equal to the number of the Elder God, or pass. Once all the dice are placed or players have passed, in ascending order, the Elder Gods give their gifts to the Cultists who invoked them: the Cultists may have to lose Sanity points to receive the rewards. After Cultists have taken their dice back, in turn order each one may place his disk on one Building that is connected to another one he has already marked (starting from the House). To do so, he must pay the Domain resources required.

The Cthulhu theme is nice and the art is great, beyond that, everything about this game is slightly inferior to Kingsburg.  More random, less variety, and less player agency.  Events are very random and can make or break the game.  Component quality is sub-par and component design is simply horrible.  The 20 characters take a stupid amount of table space for no benefit: this should have been a side board 1/4 of the size.  Having the buildings on a central board makes no sense: it's hard to see, you forget what you own, you are constantly leaning over, and there's only one scenario where that board couldn't just be replaced with individual player mats.  Having the building rules on tiles instead of printed on the board is also useless: "they did it for expansions I guess", only no such expansion exists.  And in case on an expansion, the tile could have covered the printed text.  This game needs player aids something fierce, and none are provided (print some from the bgg files).  So bottom line, just play Kingsburg instead.

TV loves this game.

BUT Theme is VERY dark and the theme is NOT light (like Kingsburg, for example).

This is oft compared to Kingsburg; but there ARE significant differences. EG: Sanity and spells (very Chtullu). Also, everyone is building on the main board. They are VERY VERY similar with Kingsburg being lighter and more inviting as a pseudo-gateway.

My conclusion: play kingsburg more often THEN consider upgrading to this.

Lovecraftian themed game with a slight twist - Players take on the roll of a cultist and tried to spread their influence throughout Arkham by collecting resources and using them to buy buildings which in turn give you abilities. Each turn player roll 3 dice and can use the numbers rolled to vist 1 -3 different Ancient Ones who are numbered 1 - 19  so if you rolled a 2 4 6 you could visit the 12 god once or the 2 and the 10 god. every 4 turns each player is forced to fight an investigator so you will need to build your strength up and collect spells.

A reimplementation of Kingsburg that significantly improves the game mechanics while changing the theme from generic fantasy to competing cultists offering to the Elder Gods - what's not to love?

Strangely enough, it's mostly the re-wrap as a Cthulhu game that keeps this one from being excellent, even though it is clearly a labour of love and not just a cash-grabbing reskin. However, the mechanism of allotting your dice to gain specific benefits just clashes horribly with my idea of Lovecraft's dark deities - there are a lot of adjectives that can be usefully employed to describe the Elder Gods, but 'predictable' is not one of them.

The theme is also actively hindered by a couple of bad design choices like the oversized cards for the gods or the lack of an overview for the building abilities. In spite of these rough edges, I'd gladly play again, but I feel that there is some lost potential here.

Strictly better than it's older brother, the game still suffers from built-in AP and a play length that is too long.

The theme is largely irrelevant, but it's there, and I enjoyed the theme more than I thought I would.  Sadly, the biggest problem is that better rolls are strictly better.  There is a lot of ways to manipulate the dice, but given equal skilled players I'm convinced that better rolls will always triumph.

It is a good game, but it suffers from AP, Luck, and a bit too much fiddliness.

A great follow-up to Kingsburg.
To me the superior game of the two for a couple of reasons:
Better luck-mitigation with powerful spells that affects your die-rolling.
Better luck-mitigation when fighting against the enemies, and also slightly less focus on that and more focus on creating buildings to get some combinations going and score lots of points (compared to Kingsburg).
Varying scenarios that messes with the core rules and structure.
You get more resources, faster and easier and it feels like you're making more progress.
The sanity bar is a great resource that you need to micro-manage carefully, you never know how the events and fights might punish you!
Mana and spells are a great addition to controlling the game.
Random enemies and events add the much-needed variation to the game!


The parts I'm not overly in love with:
Could use an option to re-roll a very low roll without the building that requires you to be lower than the die roll with your HP.
The building abilities could be more fun and unique.
The spells should've been more different. There's just too many variations of the same cards, and too many copies of the exact same card.
The buildings should've had a random setup. At least for the same building, but preferably the different Lv. slots. I understand the pattern of having similar type of buildings together, but I think it will be worse with repeated plays.
The elders gods should have a random setup as well. More gods, more variety.

In other words, please have an expansion where you add more of everything and just let us pick and choose randomly.

RATING: N/A
(14092016) Kingsport Festival is a pretty good game, based on the first playthrough. It's easy to teach, somewhat easy to grasp and isn't too fiddly (having only a few kinds of tokens, cubes and dice). The art looks good and apparently is prominent enough to appreciated on it's own. Kingsport is pretty, though dark and a bit macabre. 

The game has it's issues though. For one, it's table footprint is extremely pronounced. The game takes way more space than a standard X-Wing playmat can provide (which is 3 feet by 3 feet, or around a 1x1 meters). I'd say it takes around 1.5 by 1 meters to fit the game, possibly more to be comfortable. This means that smaller kitchen setups can't really fit this monster and you'll end up on the floor. The lack of tokens helps, since you don't need to find that much space for them.

The other issue is the playtime. Sure, the game flow pretty well and there isn't that much downtime in the game, since some of the playtime is simultaneous and the turn-based playtime is very swift, since it's broken into smaller segments. Even with all of this, the first playthrough took around 2.5 hours from setup to teardown for four people (including teaching the rules) and I have to say, there isn't that much substance in the game to justify the length. The game feels like a light filler mechanically, having very little in the way of strategy or freedom of choice (this is NOT a sandbox-y game like Caverna, Terra Mystica or the like). 

So, I'm willing to play the game again, but I don't think it's a masterpiece in any way or form. For a Mythos fan, it has more value thanks to the fanboy factor. For other people, I'd say you will find better dice-chuckers for a better price.

This is a bit of a guilty pleasure game for me. I don't think it's the best-designed game, but between the Cthulhu theme, the different scenarios, and the ease of play, there's something strangely addictive about this game. Some strategies are more dominant than others, but I enjoy exploring different avenues to victory. Ultimately, however, the runaway leader problem and the length of each game made it easy for me to get rid of this one. I have better, more thematic Lovecraftian games in my collection.

Interesting game of dice resource gathering.

As with many dice games, there is an element of luck involved in the game, getting the roll you need to collect the resource type you want is unpredictable. There are ways to mitigate that, but they themselves (spell cards, locations) are also reliant on a degree of luck. 

Fun game, but a long game. Would be interested to see if there are new powers/changes to the old ones that would affect the play.

Gioco che ricorda Kingsburg con tutti i pregi e difetti. Tra i difetti ci metto che il gioco è molto soggetto al caso dovuto al lancio dei dadi, rispetto a kingsburg il tutto viene mitigato dal fato che le azioni più potenti devono essere anche pagate profumatamente con punti Sanità Mentale e quindi non così imprescindibili, inoltre le carte magia permettono di modificare il lancio dei dadi permettendo un po' di guidare la propria fortuna. Tra i pregi invece la linearità del gioco, la sua innegabile semplicità e soddisfazione nel giocarlo spensieratamente. Anche in 5 giocatori i tempi morti non sono eccessivi. Le carte investigatori e fato aggiungono un po' di pepe al gioco con variabili impreviste, anche se viene fornita la possibilità di sbirciarle. Più 'particolare' la carta di fine gioco che potrebbe capovolgere l'esito della partita, anche questa carta può comunque essere letta prima sfruttando lo specifico potere. Buona la varietà di scenari che permettono di cambiano l'andamento delle partite fornendo una buona longevità. In sintesi lo trovo un buon giocabile che ha nell'essere troppo dadoso il più grande difetto.

In this game you are a cultist trying to take over the town of Kingsport with the aid of the Great Old Ones.
This game is a sort of retheme of Kingsburg. In Kingsburg you would roll three dice and based on your roll you could divide your dice any way you liked to secure the favor of one of the nobles.
After all dice are played in all 4 seasons, you then had to deal with an attack that hopefully you had prepared for.

Well in Kingsport, you will roll your three dice, place them to collect favors from the Great Old Ones (giving up a little sanity in the process), then use those favors to take over a new location in Kingsport.

At certain random points in the game there will be a raid of investigators coming to attack the cultists...that would be us.
Hopefully the favors you acquire and the town spaces you control will allow you to successfully avoid the penalties of the raids.

The favors come in the form of red, purple and black cubes that are needed in certain numbers to take over a town space on the board.
Other favors come in the form of spells and cult points (victory points).

A surprisingly easy game to teach and play and perfect for the season.
Players win by collecting the most cult points.

Dice, Dice, Dice -- and if they hate you, this is gonna be hard -- not impossible, but very, very hard.  There are some decisions to make, but usually they are always about maximizing your gain based on what you roll.  Some long term planning, but that planning is still very dependent on what you can get for your rolls.  That said, I enjoy playing the electronic copy of it I have -- just wish the software was a little more streamlined for single player vs machine(s).

Wow, I really need to stop getting sucked in by the atmosphere from these Ameri-trash games. Kingsport Festival is an awful, confusing, pointless, and worthless entry in the Cthulu mythos. Mechanics are uninspiring and boring, the theme is tacked on and has no relationship to the game at all. The game does get points for "flipping the script" for players taking on the mantle of cultists attempting to bring the ruin of the known world and fighting investigators and characters in the Arkham Universe but Kingsport Festival still felt long and uninteresting for the majority of the time I played. We didn't even finish the game when we realized how much this game sucked.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A game with the core mechanism of Kingsburg from the same designers. So how does it compare to Kingsburg?

Well, the positive is that gaming time seems to more under control in Kingsport Festival. Our first game took 100 minutes with all 4 new players (but all played Kingsburg before) and some time loss due to getting drinks, that's as good as the 90 minutes the box promises. The gaming time is my biggest complaint about Kingsburg as it can take too long for what it is, so that seems to be fixed in Kingsport Festival.

But then the negative. In Kingsburg there was a reward/token that let you manipulate your dice by 1. That made you had more control to manipulate dice. Here you have almost none. The purple spells aren't that flexible as those tokens. 
An other big minus point is that this game contains more Ameritrash as it adds events, so this game contains definitely more chaos. And the Festivalcard is a total crapshoot as there is hardly any chance to look at it AND prepare for it. 
The artwork is also very dark (probably OK for the Cthulhu-lovers) and the text is small, very small. Especially on the cards it's a shame they spoil half of the card with flavour text nobody is gonna read, while you need a lot of light and good sight to be able to read the actual text that matters.

For me it's clear: Kingsburg stays in the collection, this one can go.

This is a much better version of Kingsburg. The game works pretty much the same way, where you roll dice and then assign the dice to action spots that generate you resources. Then you spend the resources to unlock new abilities. In this game, rather than have a personal tech tree, there is a central board where you both get abilities and points. The dice luck is mitigated by the decks of cards you can draw from to get special one time use powers. The graphic design on this game is a bit rough, but otherwise it's thoroughly enjoyable.

RATING: 7.5
Not so much "inspired by" Kingsburg, as "shamelessly duplicating" Kingsburg.  That's not bad, honestly.  Kingsburg is cool game, and is pretty sparse on theme.  I enjoy Cthulhu mythos, and in KF, they've slathered on the spooky occult stuff pretty heavily.  Do you use wood, iron, and stone to create "buildings"?  Nope, you use "evil, destruction, and death" to "infiltrate"...er...buildings.  
It's pretty silly.  But, I do like it.  It's Kingsburg with spells and "evil."  
There's a few problems: First, even though you don't have player tableaus (the board is a shared one with all players), it is a space hog.  It was tricky to get on to our reasonably large table. Second, it is a bummer that they didn't at least put the names of the Elder Gods on their "dice areas" (whatever they're called).  For a game so in love with the theme, it seems silly to have to pick up the card and read it if you're curious about which God you've selected.  Odd choice by the publishers.  Also...runs a bit long and can be a little difficult to keep track of your building powers, but Kingsburg had that problem too, I thought.  
Other than that...yep, fun game, but if you've played Kingsburg, you'll get the rules in about ten minutes (and you'll probably end up using errata/fixes for that game in this one...for example, with ties on the rolling phase), and, probably have a good time doing it.  Do you need to own both?  Eh...

A refreshing change of pace after I've long grown tired of Kingsburg. There's a bit more luck involved here, with the random spell, event, and investigator cards, but it seems like players can easily prepare for just about any situation. I love the layout of the board, even with the overload of details every player has to look at. This feels like Kingsburg, but also feels like something entirely new. The promos makes it even better, and i can't wait to see what expansions they come up with for this great game.

A pleasing game that is surprisingly well integrated with the theme.

There is a tad more randomness that I'd like, but I still find it pleasing to roll dice and make the best tactical use of the situation.  Granting a free reroll each turn and perhaps ramping up some events (to make foresight more important) would make the game deeper, but it's still fund for what it is.

update:  a bit too random as is, but easily fixed:
(1) you can double up but pay 1 sanity per die already there (no sanity for X)
(2) start with 1 purple card
(3) peek 1 when you visit the X

Well, this game is definetely superior to Kingsburg. While it's true that it's learning curve is higher because of the cards and the abundance of random factors (they can very well swing the game, and to know about them, and how to maximize/minimize their effect, can give a big edge), it's variety is bigger for the same exact reason. Most of the time, you find yourself struggling between different choices: should i rush to the Museum to get one free card per turn, or can i afford to summon a deity that gives me cards, while i focus on other things? An investigator is coming: should i get +2 Strenght from the Sanatorium or i can trust one black card to be enough to fend him off? And i got enough magic and sanity to backup those plans? And what if the event before the investigator is something nasty against which i'm not prepared? And so on.
The swingness of all those elements may not be appreciated by some players, but, on the other hand, they add a lot of uncertainy that are coherent with the flavor of the game (in the world of Lovecraft magic is never safe, and you are almost never guarantee that you will be able to get the perfect card you need at the perfect moment). It's true that some locations are probably overpowered (Museum, Newsroom) while other are weaker (District, Hospital), but again it's easy to stack up on cards or ability fueled by magic and then realize that you don't have enough resources (sanity, cubes or magic) to use them all. All this uncertainty makes for very tense games, that very often are decided during the last turn, or better still, with the Festival Card (a card that can give offers points at the end of the game depending by things like having more Magic, more cards and the like).
So, all in all, for hardcore games who are not unfazed by random elements, Kingsport is a great improvement from Kingsport, and a must buy for whoever like the basic dices mechanic.

More or less Kingsburg with a Lovecraftian coat of paint. I'm not quite sure what it is, but I don't enjoy Festival as much as I enjoy Kingsburg. I think that Kingsport Festival gives a little less control over the end result of dice (IE, it's lacking things like the Market/Farm/etc that give a bit of mitigation).

The spell deck does give you a little bit of ability to change things there, but since that's dependent on a random card draw, it's not guaranteed.

tl;dr: [thing=27162][/thing] de-developed

Yes, this feels like they went back to one of the beta versions of Kingsburg, before they developed and streamlined that game. The result is a much messier, less focused game. Some people might prefer the Lovecraft theme, but that shouldn't blind them from the fact that this game just isn't as good.
Also, I don't get some of the production choices. The building map is now a central board that makes having a good overview much harder. The places for the dice are now individual tiles, not a board. The tiles are overly big and thus use more table space than necessary. I guess they plan on releasing alternative versions or whatever, but you could still put them on top of a board, couldn't you?
The action cards switch things up a bit, but I didn't feel like they where a valuable addition.
The original is just much cleaner.

Interesting idea to use the Kingsburg dice worker placement mechanic for a Cthulhu themed game.
I really like the change in perspective: being a cultist trying to build up your cult and power.

But sadly the game has some serious problems:
- It needs too much table space with the 19 big deity cards laid out! The board isn't designed well. The space on it could be used more efficiently and maybe even fit the deities onto the board.
- It's hard to keep track of the game state, especially the buildings and their effects. And some resources are cubes while some are on the board (sanity, magic).
- It feels very mechanical and abstract: There's a lot of resource cubes counting back and forth without having much from it. The theme fails in coming through and giving the player some reward for what he's doing.
- There is almost no interaction between the players besides during the dice placement. Players just somehow share the buildings if they have the same.
- I'm not sure if there are really different strategies that work. And it heavily depends on your dice rolling. Players often have the same buildings.
- A lot of the game elements don't have real impact: The inspectors and events often don't matter. A lot of the deities are never used in a game. Points mainly come from the buildings and it's all about getting the resources to be able to build the big buildings. At least in a two player game sanity doesn't matter because you get free sanity every turn. Even the spells don't do that much. And playing with hidden festival cards for endgame scoring doesn't offer a strategy change, it's basically pure luck if you hit its condition and get bonus points. It would probably be better to reveal them at start of the game.
- The artwork isn't that good. The deities look fine, but the board and the card design should be better.
- The rulebook isn't clear in some cases.
- The very dark theme (although cool) limits the people you can play this with.
- The references to the original Lovecraft and Cthulhu literature are nice, but don't help the game in any way.

Kingsport Festival takes the basic Kingsburg mechanism and hangs a more complex game around it.  Poor production choices make this difficult to enjoy.  The board is busy and surrounded by giant tiles.  Instead of iconography, the buildings are labeled with rows of tiny text. There are few opportunities to modify die rolls, making this MORE luck dependent than the original.  The result is harder to play than Kingsburg, with no additional satisfaction.

RATING: 6
Rating after playing one game without scenario (the recommended intro game). 

Kingsburg, the Cthulhu expansion. More opaque than Kingsburg. The resources are destruction, death and evil and you are just much more used to handling stone, wood and gold. The buildings have functions which don't have much to do with their names, while in Kingsburg everything works thematically. The additional resources magic and stability add to the complexity but do not necessarily improve the game. I like, however, that the buildings are not arranged in lines but in a network which allows for more flexibility.

The game really needs a player board or tokens to pick up for your buildings to remind you of their effects and rules you have to apply.  The cards to place the dice on are unnecessarily large so the game takes up a lot of space.

RATING: 7.5
This is almost definitely a better game than base game Kingsburg.

The lacking bit is that the buildings are static and there are fewer of them, that is really the only negative I can lay on it.

The concept of Sanity as a counterbalance to great rolls and strong actions is a brilliant addition.

The addition of the cards definitely makes combat more interesting as well as allowing for some more interesting plays.  Think of the cards almost as a 1 off super powered building.

There were a few random events that seemed extremely harsh to me, particularly one at the end of the game that caused you to lose a building if you didn't have left over resources...that seemed like penalizing good play and would have left a sour cloud over the game if it changed the winner.

That was pretty much my only knock, otherwise it takes Kingsburg and add some more interesting stuff to it and the concept of sanity which balances out luck a bit.

Rating is based on initial play

This is effectively a variant of Kingsburg with Arkham Horror trappings, which on the face of things should be pretty awesome.

Mechanically, I love the game.  It has a very modular feel with greater depth than Kingsburg, so it is ripe for both expansion and strategic shennanigans.  The core "my dice block yours" is still here, with the added twist that everyone is building on the central board.

I would almost rate it a 9, but my main criticism is that the board is very busy.  The way the building benefit is a piece of cardboard in the middle of the space is very distracting, so it is kind of hard to see what is going on.  If they had done buildings like the mini-decks in Arkham or Battlestar, that would have alleviated the situation tremendously.  

All in all, great.  If you like Kingsburg, you'll love this, probably.

[thing=154509][/thing] is a reworking of [thing=27162][/thing], working much in the same way: roll dice, use them - together or alone - to place in places accordingly with the number or total, in order to gain resources. But the experience from brought a lot of new ideas, tweaks and, in my opinion, improvements over the basic gameplay of [thing=27162][/thing].

First, [thing=154509][/thing] has more ways to deal with the lack of luck in the dice rolls: there are two buildings that affect the dice (one to re-roll other to change value by 1), a spot were dice of any value can be placed, and, most of all, the addition of the spells, that allow changes to the dice, fight better or gain more resources or points.

Second, the replay value is much increased: sadly the buildings are always set in the same place, still the game comes with different scenarios and game end scorings - the former can change the game a lot, as the Raids (which have basically the same function of the Barbarian attacks in [thing=27162][/thing]) can come in different rounds, and the play itself is slightly tweaked; and the latter adds the tension. Also, the Raids also add replay value, there are plenty of different Investigators and several Events, that affect the battle. Is possible that [thing=154509][/thing] has more replay value than [thing=27162][/thing] even when added the To Forge a Realm expansion.

Third, the cost (in sanity) to use the higher value spots give more balance, making rolling high not always an advantage. Fourth, the way the buildings are set on the board allow for more freedom of choice regarding the path made to get things.

All of these were improvement over an already good game, one that I like quite a bit.

One part that we are on the fence is the end of game score: there is little chance to learn beforehand what it will be, and it can decide close games (or even not so close). One of them was really swing (the one that gives points for magic and takes due to sanity) and left a sour taste. Yet, after a while we start to think that it is meant to work as the goals from Troyes: meaning that players should know and try to be prepared for any and all of them  (but in Troyes you can use what the others are doing as clues). Ir seems that it would serve the game better if the end of the game score could be seen sooner - or if each player have one in hand from the start.

What isn't an improvement are the fonts used and their size: they range from terrible to dreadful and make reading the manual, specially the examples of play and in the flavor of the spell cards. The overall graphic desing is also lacking: most of it is simply too dark, and the way the pieces cover the art on the board is a slap in the artist face. Not only that, probably to save money, the game has five player colors: green, red, purple, yellow and black, and have three types of colors for the resources cubes: purple, red and black. Not a good decision.

In the end, [thing=154509][/thing] won't change the mind of those that tried and disliked [thing=27162][/thing] - the feel, even with improvements, is still mostly the same, with the rolls, gathering of resources, making buildings and fighting a menace - also some degree of luck is there and the interaction is indirect at best. However, for those that did liked [thing=27162][/thing] and just wanted more freedom, replay value and options, and don't mind the new theme, [thing=154509][/thing] might just be what you were looking for.

I have always kind of liked Kingsburg, but it always seemed to me whoever rolled the highest won. After several plays of Kingsport I have to say that was definitely mitigated by the Sanity track. Sometimes when you roll 16-18 you don't want to take the high numbered character because it will lose you precious points. The Spell cards, Magic Track, Scenarios, and Sanity track all put this game over the top.

Good game, but not as good as Kingsburg (with expansion), which it greatly resembles. The abilities of the buildings are much harder to keep track of and the spell cards feel unbalanced and ultimately are an unnecessary addition to the game, making it less streamlined and elegant. In any case, I do not see the need to own both games.

New take on Kingsburg, and it's better.  It's risky when you roll high, as it costs you Sanity to occupy the spots for greater reward.  Run low on sanity and you can get hit pretty badly by events, and if you run out, you start losing points.  Great, great game.

Ok game. Great art and cool theme. Maybe too dark for some. I much rather play Kingsburg. Seems tougher then KB. End game scoring kind of ruined the game for me with hidden card.

I don't know exactly why but I prefer the original one. I remember Kingsburg as more streamlined, clean and somehow fast and "user friendly". We played this in 4 and our table was quite wide, we always had to get up to read the special abilities we had gained so far as now they are not on a simple line but on a more complex topology. It also seems to me that there is more stuff to keep updated and KF seems more fiddly. Surely the first game lasted quite long. We all had the same impression that red cards are a bit pointless.
All in all, still a good game, with nice art, but i would go for the original.

Kingsburg variant. More complex, more random. Very AP prone.

I haven't played Kingsburg but have heard great things so I was excited to play this.
I enjoyed the dice placement part and working out where it was best to put the dice. I also liked the stress/anticipation of people going where you wanted to go. I also have no issue with the theme though I felt it was a bit pasted on.
I found any engine building aspect of it to be a bit underwhelming though. The spots on the board you can go (build) had lack lustre benefits.
Also, I like games where you add up various points at the end to add to your existing score: I felt that end of game scoring was a bit flat (there was none, but adding the scenarios would help but I don't think enough). 
Overall a decent and reasonably fun family weight game but I prefer others to this.

Bad copy cat /cash in from Kingsburg. That was well themed, with good material and clear graphics.
This is a disgrace.

I prefer Kingsburg. I don't like the central board where you can't see the available buildings.

Gorgeous art, great theme, and solid mechanics. My only wish is that it worked for two players, though I have been trying a variant suggested online which seems to work decent.

Fantastic solitaire simulation.  At first, the game seems incredibly complex.  After a few failed plays, the complexity fell away and the game started to click for me.  When it did, it sped up and became this amazing session of flying over and smashing the opposition (which would then do their best to take out my pilots).

At first, frustratingly difficult (Iraq - Surge scenario start), but then the game just made sense and felt fun.

RATING: 7
This game is tough and unforgiving. Every step is a decision which has consequences further down the line. But its fun and well worth its price tag. There is a lot of game and replayability in this box. A must have for any gamer.

Must eat my words on this. Becomes tedious after a few more games. Just repeating the same decisions. Traded

RATING: 6
Excellent and addictive game for those who don't mind spending hours in planification rather than actually playing. If you like tactical RPG and pass hours in the menus, if you like spending hours creating an army, deciding which troops to add and which weapons to give, that game is for you.

Beware, though, i was lured by the description: only 30 minutes for one mission. A mission is not a game, and if you don't have anywhere to leave the game lying (or if you have a cat), you will have to make all missions in a row, and that means a lot of them, and thus a lot of time! 
6 missions for a light campaign, that means at least 3 hours, without counting the setting.

I drop the score for that reason (from 8 to 6): because i just can't find the time to play it again.

One of the coolest solitaire wargames out there. Better than Hornet Leader. Full of tough decisions all the way.

The game really tells a story where you take part in. Preparing the mission, choosing which enemy to head for...how much missiles you can carry... how much damage you will face, what impact does it have on your pilots. The game thinks of everything, but therefore the rulebook is some heavy load and you need to practice a lot to finally have the whole game fluent.

And another Leader game...this time with some terrain features. Most people seem to like it better than Phantom or Hornet Leader, I however don´t.
In the others, things are less chaotic, so planning is definitely the focus. Here you have to improvise a lot more, wich sounds interesting, but somehow doesn´t work for me too well.

better than hornet leader. in TAL, the dice influence is lower (weapons are usually easy to hit) and i enjoy it. like all dvg games i have, i feel a lack of simulation, and may be a deeper rules would be ok.

RATING: 9
Borrowed a friend's copy. Took a quiet day (so few to be found!) and did a learn through with the rules out. Well written rules format made it easy to learn as I played. This is a long game, depending on the scenario. Tons of replay value with different missions and goals in those missions. High tension when your pilots and planes are attacked.  Then when you pull that "killed" hit.  Ouch. This is a game I did not want to stop playing--it's that good. But you have to be in the right mind-set for a brain-intensive strategy session.  Would love to acquire.

An excellent remake of the old GMT game.  DVG streamlined gameplay tremendously, removing some of the more complicated mechanics found in the original.  The graphics are also updated, making the game a visual feast on the table.

RATING: 8
+ Thoroughly immersive solo gaming experience. You'll find yourself making sound effects and yelling out loud if you aren't careful. At the very least, you will not hear anyone else in the house trying to talk to you while you are figuring out your mission plan or your next move.
+ Sets up fast.
+ Missions play fast. Knock out a complete mission in 30-45 minutes. Campaigns take about 8-12 missions, but each mission plays like a mini-game in itself. Very suitable when you have an hour to spare.
+ Quick and easy to learn.

+/- Hard to win. Heck, hard to even make it to the end of a multi-day campaign without it ending prematurely in failure.  Every time I think I have it figured out and am going to hammer this battalion to smithereens, something happens and I suddenly lose an airplane and get a couple of pilots all shot up.

- The complexity of choosing your pilots, their experience levels, and your aircraft can cause decision paralysis during campaign planning. I've decided to randomly select my pilots, their experience levels, and the aircraft. Sorry, but a Commander generally does not get to choose his team. He adapts to deal with the situation using the assets and people he has.

Completely addictive game. My wife is going to lose patience with me very soon over how thoroughly engrossed I become with this game. I'm sorry, what did you say?.....Just one more mission dear.....

RATING: 7
Update: Similar to what I said for War Fighter, it is imperative that you outfit your pilots with effective aircraft for the mission and probably more importantly, choose the right weapons for your objective. Otherwise, there will be frustration from combat failures that will disguise themselves as bad dice rolls. One must do an effective job at mitigating risks.

This used to be my favorite title back when I was new to gaming. It's still a solid title, though.

CONDITION: Like new played once. I have clipped the counters and highlighted a few passages in the rule book. 

This is a great game but I feel that HL:CAO and TAL are having a hard time sitting next to each other on my shelf. Reasons I would use something in HL are sometimes not represented in TAL for the same thing. And that just throws me.  I would be willing to trade this for D-Day at Omaha Beach, Field Commander Napoleon or Heroes of Normandie.

This is a very unique design. Nothing like anything I've played before, although I understand there are others like it (a series). I love the tactical nature of the combat portion of the game. However, I don't much care for the pre-mission planning, especially the choosing of pilots and manipulating their experience level. I have only played a handful of games, but so far that seems to take longer than I care for, yet seems to be critical to success. In any case, I'd like to play this more when I get around to it. This will be competing with Mage Knight for my solo playing. 

Edit: Great game, but I'm just not interested enough in solo gaming to bother with it.

RATING: 6
Yeah....

I wanted to like this. I loved Phantom Leader, but then again I haven't played Hornet Leader (yet). The mechanics are rather nice, the board setup is indeed lovely and fairly original, but I just felt like I was shuffling and juggling chits for too little return.

In Phantom Leader the player constantly feels under pressure, and the limited nature of the resources available encouraged frugality and a sense of real impending doom on each mission. It also made the planning stage a major part of the fun. I didn't feel that here, maybe because in the modern world we all know the West has a ridiculous air-and-technological-and-financial superiority. Thus the PL-like mechanics of frugal resources just felt artificial and forced, and not like the political constraints of Vietnam by a White House worried about the evening news.

Equally, the sheer number of campaigns and pilots available made me not care about them individually; there was no sense of story or immersion or tension, just a bad roll of the dice and a need to find another pilot to fly the next one.

Nice components, shame about the game. A case of there almost being too much in the box to make it fun (and that's not something I've ever said before).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Definitely my favorite solo game.  Just enough detail in every aspect to be fun and full of decisions, but not sloggy and slow.  Planning phase is as good as many other solo games in how you pick team and weapons.  But the actual fighting part...  The ridges and movement rules are so simple but make every mission as stressful as any turn based computer game.  And it fits easily on a standard folding table.

RATING: 10
another great solitaire game from DVG.. on the level with phantom leader and hornet leader.. (how much DVG paying people to give high scores for his games ????)

however, for such a great game , there's few room of improvement (that didnt take the score of 10 )

- separating aircraft and pilots is great system, by why all pilots looks the same ?
- since this is A10 and Heli gunships, why dont the game have scenarios to protect ground troops ? like covering a landing team, or saving a downed pilot ?
- would love a clear separation of service (like phantom leader UsAF and USN separate campaign). would love to see AH1 Cobra and Harrier of USMC having their own campaign.
- No female pilots (hey some of them served in AC130 and AH64
- i would love to see Russian version of the game , frogfoot and Hind leader, although the campaign will be limited to few places since russia/soviet dont love war as much as the american warmongers...

Thanks for Derek Case with his 'nuts and bolt' video in youtube (his channel SingleHandedWarfare) and to Chris from NWS online for sending me this game with great price ..

RATING: 7
I love the Leader series of games - Kitting up your crew and then throwing them into the belly of the beast to see how they do is enjoyable. But like some of the other Leader games, I find myself overwhelmed with choices. From pilots, the craft they fly and the weapons there are tons of options and combos and to be honest I hit a moment of paralysis when I look at the options available. So I find myself stumbling out of the gates which I know would lessen the more I played, and once I'm rolling the game is a blast...It's just getting rolling that I've been having a hard time with as of late.

[i]Nov 2014: [/i] Adjusting Rating 9. A top 20 game.
[i]July 2012: [/i] Wow! Rating of 8+! I thought the Air Leader series couldn't get better than Hornet Leader: Carrier Air Operations (HL:CAO). I was wrong. Well worth the wait (I preordered and paid 18 months ago! ) and I can't wait to play this one again!

+ I find a lot of enjoyment in the tension in this game, with the planning and in the execution of the missions. Good planning is rewarded most of the time. Murphy's Law can bite you in the behind at any moment - warriors beware! 
+ The rulebook was clear and answered all of my rules questions. The pace of each combat turn picked up once I was familiar with the flow of the game
+ The combination of Campaign (Iraq 1991, North Atlantic 1986, etc) and Conflict Type (Surge, General War, etc) provides for a good variety of campaigns
+ Once the prep (punching out the counters and sorting the components) and campaign prep was out of the way, the game really delivered.

Minor nits:
- The counters were a bit of a pain to punch out
- Pilot art was generic. Would have been nice to have each pilot look unique

Probably one of the best solo wargames ever made. Not that I've ever played another one, but I've researched quite a few and this really does hit the sweet spot. Complex without being complicated, forever tense, interesting progression, quality components, and hard! It takes a couple attempts to really get the flow going, but the flow will come. You must enjoy thinking out which weapons would be best to load with which planes to seat with which pilots, etc., but then you are ready to launch and just blow shit up!  A die roll can often be the matter between life and death; so yes, there is luck. But like many wargames with a d8, it's all about managing probabilities.

One of the only possibly negative things I had heard about this game is that it is "fiddly". That is true - if someone is looking for a light, somewhat mindless experience to relax with then this game definitely isn't a good choice.

However, for anyone looking for a deeper, extremely satisfying solitaire experience, this is a great game! 

There are many choices to make, from the selection of missions, planes, pilots, armaments to how to approach the battlefield, what altitude to fly at, what targets to attack, with what planes and what weapons, etc... 

There are also many random elements to keep the game interesting. The tiles are placed randomly as are the enemies resulting in an infinite variety of conflicts every time you engage a battalion. Also, cards are drawn before the battles and on the journey home that can have a positive or negative effect.

The overall system is brilliant. Though there is a lot to keep track of, it is so well thought out that everything eventually falls into place. It took me a few hours to learn the system, but once everything clicked, it became easy to play just off of the memory aids with very little reference to the rulebook (and this is on the first playthrough!). 

It is unforgiving, but although there is the possibility of bad luck, so many decisions are under the player's control that, when things wend poorly, I always felt I could have made better decisions. 

I understand why this game remains popular years after its release. Utter perfection! (Posted on 15-06-21)

It's a good thing I didn't have this game in high school or college or I would have ended up cold, broke, and alone, living inside the game's bullet-proof box. Separating the pilots from the planes and giving us a tactical map to fight on during missions elevates this above both Hornet Leader and Phantom Leader for me, and that's saying a lot. This is a perfect marriage of theme and design.

As a high fan of the Hornet Leader and Phantom Leader games, I was instantly drawn to another great looking title in the Leader series from DVG.

My initial rating was 8.5, par for the course for my personal ratings for Leader games. 

I tried very, very hard to enjoy this game, and after my fifth and final try... sold the game and dropped my initial rating to a 5. Frustrated, disappointed and just didn't have the fun that I assumed would be had considering my enjoyment with the other titles. Seems unreasonably difficult from the mission selection and the weapon point allotment.

Sold, knowing it would never make my gaming table again.

I will consider other aircraft Leader games in the future ( U-Boat, Tiger, IAF etc ), but probably NOT the Huey Leader game if it uses the same system.

Alas... I tried.

[EDIT] Okay, here's the deal.
-You need at least two deep (DVG) counter trays, well-sorted with a clear organizational scheme.
-You need the ability to walk away and come back between missions.
-You need to internalize how you're supposed to spend SO points, especially with respect to munitions (reading the example of play helps)
-You need to accept that missions will be roughly 50/50 setup and actual play.
If you can accept all of that, the game is indeed an extremely fun solo game.

Original comment follows:
A bit of a heartbreaker for me, as I love Warfighter, solo games, and the Warthog (I think it's actually quite pretty, myself).
It is fun to see a wake of destruction behind your metal birds, it is true. But oh, my, the endless chit-pulling and chit-finding is ever so tedious. And yes, I have counter trays. But between the laborious setup (find and place ten of these, eight of these, etc. etc.) and the repetitive damage resolution (pull six light hits, now get a pylon marker and a bullet holes marker, etc.)... And the fun bits of setup, the shopping, are similarly mired in fumbling around with too much stuff. If I could be persuaded that there is a good organizational schema that makes it effortless, I would gladly try again.

What a fabulous, rich, spectacular game full of emotional hooks. It has everything I want in a game. 

Planning ahead in this game (choosing pilots, ammo, missions for the day) is extremely interesting. Accomplishing a mission makes your pilot more skilled, but it takes a toll (stress). You need to balance growing your pilots and helping them recover. Choosing the order of missions to do this can be a fascinating problem. 

When you actually fly the missions, unexpected things happen and you need to improvise and adapt. There are both glorious and painful moments with the dice that get your heart pumping. Extremely tense battles, especially when you take on assault battalions.

What surprised me the most was how a sort of back story emerges after you fly a few missions and progress in the campaign.  Managing the crew adds an unexpected narrative layer to the gameplay as your pilots grow more skilled, but also become more psychologically damaged, or, sadly, die. 

The game is tough. The option to accomplish a mission half way and then come back to finish it off helps mitigate certain swings while still keeping it real (every mission you fly takes more of a toll on the crew).

Extraordinary and rich game.

I just realised for myself that there is nothing more depressing for me, than to play a solo game. So i gotta rate this a 2, for i will never play it again.


_____________________________________________________
Man that was a let down.. not that it's a bad game, i just had such high hopes after all the buzz from marco arnaudo..
The pilot/aircraft/weapon management is okay, but the actual missions become samey incredible quickly. Also there is no distinction between let's say the iraq campaign and the III WW.. you would think there is, but there isn't.. same landscape, same enemy counters, same same.. as are all the pilots, just different numeric distribution.. there is none that's really better than another just +1/+2/+1 instead of +2/+1/+1.. boring.. and the worst, the same picture is used for !every! f****ng pilot..!
You're looking for a Apache Pilot..? Here take one version of our 10 clones.. they all smile and look boring as fuck! (it's just that i would've loved to identify/care for my pilots..)

The tactical decisions are not too complicated but calculating them feels more like work than fun & there aren't too many different approaches to achieving victory.. more like okay for the 2 SAMs i need a fast F-16 with mk20's, for the buildings i need the apache with the AGM.. bit like a shopping list.

Additionally the Game Goal is kinda underwhelming.. 
just a VP table with different adjectives like good, bad, etc.
if i imagine playing the very looooong campaign and falling short 1 point from great because of a unlucky event card draw (pretty lucky them events) would i play the whole thing again..?

if this was a computer game (and solitaire games feel a lot like those), i wouldn't play it.

Sorry if all this sounds too negative.. if i liked solos at all i'd rate this a solid 6 & if you're into solitaires & the theme than you should probably check this one out.

Part of the Leader Series from DVG, this is a solo game done right. Firstly, the production is outstanding.  Everything from the component quality to the rulebook is just top notch.  More importantly, the gameplay holds up very well.  The campaign structure allows you to get invested in the pilots, following them from day to day and mission to mission and makes the decisions that you make in the planning phases important. Plenty of mission and event cards make for good replayability- highly recommended.

RATING: 8
A great solo game and a great modern warfare game. The need to manage your pilots' stress provides you with a whole other set of interesting choices to make outside of where to drop your bombs (though those are still very interesting decisions). The air-to-ground aspect with the variable map makes it a lot less abstract than the other aircraft games in the Leader series.

There are a couple minor gripes I have like the repeated pilot artwork and sub-optimal record sheet, and I have to wonder if three double-sided cards per pilot was the most efficient way to show their progress (though to be fair I haven't come up with a better alternative myself).

If I could say one thing is missing from the game it's the presence of friendly forces on the ground. While these needn't be on the tactical map (the "close" in Close Air Support is a relative term, after all) I'd like to see some on the Sector Map--both to make that aspect of the game more dynamic and to give the missions some clearer, more interesting stakes.

Il y a beaucoup à lire et un peu mélangeant car on a un certains ordre dans la description du jeu.  J'arrive à l'exemple de jeu.  Je vais voir si je comprends un peu mieux comment ça se passe.  Beaucoup de pilotes et d'avions j'ai bien hâte de voir comment tout se place.

Enfin de compte je n'ai pas joué.  J'ai mis no retreat à la place.  Je ne sais pas si je vais le ressortir à un moment donnée.  Je trouve ok les préparations le jeu par jour mais le temps n'était pas là.  Un autre fois quand j'aurais le bon timing.

I like it but I wish I would have waited for B17 leader. Apparently I am more into the WWII theme. To me the best part is deciding what aircraft to include in your squadron then which aircraft and pilot to allocate to each mission each day. I need to play more than the introductory mission to get a good feel. I think this is a 9 when I am in the modern mood and 7 when I am not! LOL. I need a WWII leader so I am covered for whatever mood i am in. Oh, flying the missions are tough so that is good. Stay low to avoid pop ups but then that stresses the pilots when flying over ridges. Stay high at high altitude and suddenly the battlefield gets a little more crowded.

This is a fantastic game. It is a very accessible game, with easy to understand rules, logical actions, and simple record keeping (yes, you have to actually write some information down, but it really isn't that much). The game plays in a very smooth fashion, and the rule book is ordered so you can read it while playing your first game, it explains everything as you need it.

For me, this game feels a little like UN Squadron for the Super Nintendo. If only because you get to choose the ordinance loadout for each aircraft based on the mission you are about to undertake. 

There is a lot of thought in this process: deciding the planes you will buy, the aircraft and pilots you will commit to the mission, the weapon loadout, and how you are going to execute the mission.
I've been having a lot of fun with this. I've just finished a campaign and did pretty ok... and I'm still thinking "I should have used these aircraft here, or attacked this SAM first.." I cannot wait to play this again.

This may go higher.

Awesome solitaire game.  If you're a fan of the old Microprose Gunship, Dynamix A-10 Tank Killer, Jane's Longbow series, this is the game to get.  Yes, it's not a simulation, but it brings back a lot of the flavor from those games.  In this game, you're more like a squadron commander planning out which aircraft to take on each mission, which pilots and their loadouts, and which targets to attack.  Then you manage each mission on a very nice tactical map maneuvering the aircraft on targets and dodging enemy fire in a fixed amount of turns.   I really enjoy how you have to manage stress for your pilots.  I also like how the enemy attacks are resolved with the damage counter pulls like Conflict of Heroes, so you're not rolling dice for both your attacks and enemy attacks.

Lots of replayability in the variable setup of the campaigns and terrain of each mission in the campaigns. The rules are explained and laid out very well in the rulebook.  The components are decent.  You might want to sleeve some of the cards that might be shuffled more often.

Very satisfying!

I can see that the design is really clever, but after four sessions I'm just not grabbed by it. I may try again with a longer campaign (that will enable me to promote pilots) but I'm thinking that it will feel samey when I do. Much preferred Hornet Leader. A lot of fans write that THIS is the better game, but so far I enjoy it less. Even though the terrain is different every time, I felt less engaged by the puzzle solving than I did while playing Hornet Leader.

Others reviewers have written about the pilot cards being identical and I was surprised that that began to irritate me just a little as well. I guess I didn't need the separation of pilot and plane, either, because there was already enough to keep track of.

[BGCOLOR=#339900][COLOR=#FFFFFF]▲[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Structure-wise not perfect, but overall good rulebook (clear and brief definitions, examples to almost every rule, sample game in the back of the rulebook).

[BGCOLOR=#339900][COLOR=#FFFFFF]▲[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Great component quality.

[BGCOLOR=#339900][COLOR=#FFFFFF]▲[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Extremely helpful printed-on information on the game board and side sheet, making it theoretically unnecessary to go back to the rulebook.

[BGCOLOR=#339900][COLOR=#FFFFFF]▲[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Many options and decisions for the player.

[BGCOLOR=#339900][COLOR=#FFFFFF]▲[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Random map generation for every mission. Each campaign uses a different set of map tiles.

[BGCOLOR=#339900][COLOR=#FFFFFF]▲[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] The 8 campaign cards (categorised in 4 difficulty levels) and 6 situation cards (with very different conditions) can be used in any combination for a great modular replay value.

[BGCOLOR=#339900][COLOR=#FFFFFF]▲[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Every enemy token is double-sided, showing the unit's destroyed condition on the back side, meaning that enemy tokens won't just be removed, but destroyed units stay as wrecks and craters on the battlefield, which is indeed a nice visual detail.

[BGCOLOR=#339900][COLOR=#FFFFFF]▲[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Combat stress/war trauma is addressed and thematically integrated into the game.


Still, especially for a non-wargamer, this game has some negative aspects:

[BGCOLOR=#FF0000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]▼[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Bookkeeping is a pain: players need to keep track of certain information on the game's own record sheet before and after every mission. While it is managable, it's still a pain and slows the game down too much and too often. Additional annoyance is cause by the fact that some already written down information needs to be updated from time to time.

[BGCOLOR=#FF0000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]▼[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Component imbalance: each of the 28 pilots has 3 double-sided cards for a total of 6 different skill levels per pilot (Newbie to Ace). While the big stack of pilot cards looks impressive, players will only use a small amount of these cards in a single campaign, especially in a short to medium length campaign.

At the same time, the game features only 12 Special Condition cards and 10 Mission Event cards. The problem with these surprisingly short stacks of cards is, that 1 Special Condition card is drawn every day of a campaign (consisting of 2-10 days) while 2 Mission Event cards are drawn during every single mission (players can and will conduct various missions in a single day), meaning that both decks of Mission Events and Special Condition cards don't offer much variety and replay value.

Streamlining the game in the right place could have solved this problem - for example, by decreasing the amount of pilot skill levels from 6 to 4, resulting in 2 cards instead of 3 for every pilot and making room for 28 more cards in total which could have been split between both decks of Special Conditions and Mission Events.

[BGCOLOR=#FF0000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]▼[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Super thick cards: these are the thickest cards I have ever seen in any game and they can literally be described as cardboard cards. While this may sound nice at first, shuffling them is a real nightmare.

[BGCOLOR=#FF0000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]▼[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Playing various missions in sequence gets repetitive.

[BGCOLOR=#FF0000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]▼[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] I am aware that [b]DVG[/b] is a relatively small publisher, but the game is too expensive.


[u]Final verdict[/u]

[b]Thunderbolt Apache Leader[/b] has been my choice as a first wargame for various reasons:

1. The game is very popular and the community's feedback is overall very positive (currently crowning it as the best game of the [b]Leader[/b] series).

2. It's a pure solitaire game with a very focussed game design on exactly that.

3. The game's complexity is average.

4. The components are nice (in terms of wargames) and very functional.


While I can absolutely see why this game is so very popular among wargame/solitaire fans, it's in the end not a game for me for different reasons: the bookkeeping is a real pain, making the already slow pace of the game even slower. The game is streamlined in the right areas (mission resolution), but it still feels and plays exhausting to me because of all the moving parts to keep track of and the record sheet which requires quite some attention and time.

A big part of this game is the careful preparation and planning of each mission, choosing the target, aircraft, pilots and weapons. While all these options are indeed interesting and there is a unique charm to this concept, it's a game which demands a certain kind of mood and mindset, patience and a lot of time.

Every mission takes 45-60 minutes, with each of the Condition cards allowing for campaigns over 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 8 days, including 1-3 missions being conducted per day. So far, I only managed to play campaigns over 2-3 days -- and I already struggled finishing the 3rd mission because the game felt surprisingly exhausting. Thanks to the consistent campaign log information, the game can indeed be stored for taking breaks in-between missions, but I honestly don't enjoy the game that much to come back to it regularly, plus the setup time of this game is also really long.

Overall, I think that some of the new ideas for the [b]Leader Series[/b] are really great (random map generation, seperating campaign and situation cards, battalion movement on a zoomed-out map), while others are questionable to me, as they just clunk up the game. Seperating aircraft cards and pilots cards is for example indeed the logical next step in the evolution of the [b]Leader Series[/b], but it's not worth it in my opinion, as it mostly results in just more bookkeeping.

Instead of just adding new ideas to an existing system, some cuts should have been made in other areas in order to keep the game streamlined.

Having said all that, in comparison to [b]Phantom Leader[/b] and [b]Hornet Leader[/b], [b]Thunderbolt Apache Leader[/b] plays more dynamic: while the arming and pre-mission planning takes ~75% of the time and actually flying the mission only ~25% in [b]Phantom Leader[/b] and [b]Hornet Leader[/b], [b]Thunderbolt Apache Leader[/b] roughly goes for a 50%/50% ratio. Maneuvering the landscape plays a bigger role, enemies can go into cover, new enemies can randomly appear out of nowhere (as a penalty for the player's aircraft flying at high altitude) and players can also freely and strategically decide how many missions they want to fly on each day.

My rating might seem unfair to fans of the game, but keep in mind, I'm writing this as a non-wargamer who mostly enjoys Eurogames and Ameritrash games. It's not a bad game, but it certainly requires either an acquired taste or some intense streamlining to make it enjoyable to a non-wargamer like myself.

The material is good quality. I don't like much the tiles though and I think it's boring to have to change the ground in each mission, but it might be because they are all deserts with some hills or not.
There are interesting inovations in the game compared to the other titles in the leader serie, especially the "front line". That's the main fun of this game, which target to choose when some are coming to close (mobile units advance closer to your airfield) but others in the rear cause big disadvantages. I really like that aspect of the game.
But for the rest, I prefer Phantom Leader. 
The game is extremly difficult to win. A little too much (though, too hard is better than too easy). 
I don't like neither that unless you choose to purchase only old Cobra helicopters, your squadron will be very small, between 4 and 6 aircrafts and...you must divide it between different missions flight the same day. So, in a mission you will have...2 aircrafts compared to about 6 in Phantom Leader. 
I also don't like much to have separated cards for planes and pilots. It becomes too much bookkeeping. I prefer the more simple way that PL uses (damaged or destroyed). Also, if you fly just 2 planes, to have one with heavy damage makes you very probably fail the mission immediatly.
As someone else mentioned it, there are not enough days in each campaigns to really see the evolution of your pilots. There's not really much fun to gain expereience then.
I really wanted to like this game but...I never fell involved in a story like in other DVG games.

It is an huge disappointment and certainly not an improvement over the the previous edition. While the mission dynamics are indeed interesting there are so many problems that spoil the final product. I will not get into the details of the stupid it is a game not a simulation debate, but as it is right now the fantasy factor spoil what could have been a much better simulation of CAs operations. Components are a mixed blessing. Pilot card are anonymous and I would have liked more pilots rather than 6 level per pilots. Proper mixing of aircraft types is lacking (at least 4 F16s, ability to field 12 A-10s...). Ground unit counters are uninspired and enemy tanks have an M60 picture instead of a soviet tank... 

aircraft costs are so high that you cannot field a proper unit due to cost. It would be effective if you are just selecting aircrafts for a single package, but managing a squadron with the limitations imposed is ludicrous. 

I understand pricing and component costs, but I feel cheated by the game 70+ £ price tag to get a dumbed down and less "atmospheric" version of the original game. 

Luckily, with a bit of very house rules the game can be saved from failure (here is the 7) and with a bit of counter and card making effort it can be reshaped in something proper. 

Still the impression is that Dan took a very good base and bastardized it so much to cater for trendy, stupid, ignorant "modern wargamers" that it has lost the charm of the previous version. Have to confess I will continue to play the old more than the new...  

Edit: no more than 4, there is no point to give this disaster even a 6; 70£ wasted.

Great game.  The game does a decent job of creating enemy AI, but the real challenge is to plan, prepare and then deal with random unforeseen circumstances.  I bought the miniatures which are great for added eye candy.  I created a table to use with the miniatures so that you did not have to look back and forth for the enemy unit values.   It seems that there may bee too many versions of each pilot card, and there could have been an easier way to track skills when pilots level up.  However, this is a very minor issue that does not detract from game play.

This is an excellent game, but at present I find it slightly more involved than I'd probably like. Missions are only 20-30 minutes, but they require enough bookkeeping and upkeep that I found myself leaving my in-progress game on the desk for close to a month rather than finishing it out. Whenever I played it, I had a good time.

It's not complicated -- you just follow the steps. But there are a lot of steps and things to keep track of, by design; that's part of why it tells a good story and feels tense. It models a lot of things with a relatively light rule set, and offers a ton of interesting decisions to be made every game.

Luck plays a decent-sized role, but cuts both ways. There's luck in so many parts of the game that it washes out. You also have a lot of control over everything you do, including the ability to make and then have to live with terrible choices. I lost my first game due to some ill-considered decisions on my part, but also due to a single bad card draw and a couple of bad die rolls. It's fun to lose, a key feature of any solitaire game for me (and hell, of just about any game). 

On subsequent plays, I can see this going above a 7. Now that I know it takes some time to get up to speed whenever I take a break from an ongoing game, I'll look for time slots where I can devote 3-4 hours to it all at once, or spread over just a couple of days.

The components are great, with two exceptions: I wish the pilots were unique, a minor quibble, and my board is pretty curled up (another user described as being like a tulip, and that's about right). That would be a bigger problem if it needed to do more than hold the tiles.

It's the sort of game I'm going to think about when I'm not playing. Good stuff.

Six months later, after looking at this and not playing it on many occasions (choosing shorter, more immediately satisfying solo games in its place), I sold it. Not my cup of tea, but a fantastic game.

Way more involved than Hornet Leader. I like the added complexity (pilots and airplanes are separated for instance) and the map more than in Hornet Leader. The downside is that there it takes longer to set up and play and it feels more tiring after a while.

Good game nonetheless.

Wow. Best DVG product yet. The previous games had great moments but always had segments that would get tedious or where the pressure would let up too much.

I love how easy the new damage system is and how the enemy threat is always moving towards you. I no longer feel like I'm facing a passive enemy.

Update:
I've reached the point where I normally loose interesting in the other LEADER games but with this one I just keep getting more excited. This design has a lot more depth and the designer is supporting it better. The miniatures also keep it fresh as I'm always searching for new ways to get more of the unique aircraft and ground troops into the game! Raising my score from a 9 to 10 because I can't stop thinking about and playing this game... 

Update: I finally lost interest in TAL but I recently picked up the original version and I'm loving it. The only thing I've brought over from the new version is the hex tiles! I don't miss the complex pilot and aircraft selection and I don't miss the pilot leveling and complicated stress system. That version is faster and has more surprises... and for some reason I love the art!

A game that can yield its share of awesome moments in the thick of the action but which fails to deliver on the promise of its title--in other words, if you think you're going to actually run a squadron of Warthogs the way you can run a squadron of F-18s in Hornet Leader, forget it. The campaigns are way too skimpy, both in terms of the player's purchasing power for fitting out aircraft and in duration; in fact most are so short that there's no real reason to track experience points since pilot promotion isn't going to be a factor. 

Is it worth it then? TAL is a larger footprint and more overhead in terms of set-up and record-keeping than any of the other Leader games. The pilot art is at best comic book quality, the Mission Events deck has only 10 cards (oh, look, it's the B-52 strike again) and some campaigns seem almost mathematically impossible to win. Even ace pilots will routinely fly into the dirt when only mildly fatigued. The *only* thing saving the game is the undeniable thrill of watching your guys sweep across the map, weapons spilling off the racks, leaving a trail of destruction in their wake. But those isolated moments just don't add up to a satisfying campaign experience.

Wish I could share others' enthusiasm as it's a big box and I'm a big fan of the other Leader games, but this one comes up short for me.

[u]23-Jan-2014[/u]: This is my first "real" wargame...even though you can argue it isn't since the battles aren't based in fact.  Anyway, I'm struggling with this one at the moment.  I've only played twice so far, but neither was very successful.

I can see that this is an excellent game with lots of replay value and full of tough choices for the solo gamer.  However, my complete lack of familiarity with the subject matter is giving me some trouble getting into the game.

I will need to focus some time on this game in the near future and really get to know it so I can get the potential enjoyment from it that I can see within.  I think once I get over that hump of not understanding the basics of the military history of the planes and weapons, I will be able to get many, many plays from this one.

Unfortunately for me, that hump is standing my my way.

A good solitaire game that takes 60 minutes? Color me interested (wishlist)

*edit March 2013* Bought! 

*edit 2, March 2013* Spent hours yesterday reading the rulebook, punching chits, organizing, setting up the intro campaign.... and enjoying every second. This looks like a fantastic game, like one of the PC videogames I remember playing in the early 90s. Thematic with tactical and operational levels of combat, it's so cool! I've been finding myself pining away again for giving Mage Knight another try, but this is a theme I find much more interesting and the gameplay looks much more satisfying!

*April 2013* After two games, I can say this game moves. Most of the details for play are written on the board. The annoying part is setting up a new campaign.... I've died twice on the first mission in the Surge situation and this means I failed the campaign both times. This game is really quick to learn the rules, I find myself barely going back to the rulebook. Interesting decisions abound and it rarely feels unfair when things don't go your way (it feels thematic, actually). It's an excellent game, the bloom is still on this rose! End of the day, it's a solitaire game which means it's lacking the fun of a multiplayer game but I'm growing to love these times spent by myself; initial rating of 8.5 (which is a 10 for a solo game)

*edit Nov 2013* I haven't played this game in months. Broke it out yesterday, though. I use some player aids, including those that list pilot stats, Battalion rule exceptions, weapon counters, and Flatten the learning Curve rules summary. All make the actual PLAYING of the game much more streamlined and enjoyable.

I've played a number of solitaire games since the last time I played this. Friday, Dawn of the Zeds, Field Commander:Napoleon. All are good games (or better). This one blows them all out of the water. It's a tight game, has strategic and tactical decisions, streamlined gameplay that flows over a very thematic narrative. It gives you real decisions to make that can make or break a campaign. It allows you to make intelligent choices regarding luck. It's so, so good; a solitaire game that feels like a game and not like bailing out a rowboat with a spoon (looking at you, Dawn of the Zeds) is hard to come by. 

My one recommendation: Don't do the Surge scenario for introductory purposes. Show of Force is much better!

Rating raised from 8.5 -> 9

RATING: 6
Easier to learn than it looks.  Although the rules are slightly scattershot the "follow this procedure" presentation mostly works.
The prep work is challenging, requiring quite some consideration as you arm your aircraft and determine how best to spend your recovery assets; fix the plane or fix the pilot?
The actual "game" part (you know, the blowing shit up part) is rather dry and seems a meager reward after a lot of time spent with log sheets and arriving at loadouts.  It's okay, but I'm always left with a "is that it?" feeling.

Awesome game. This is how you do a solo game that allows for lots of replayability. Has a bit of a time commitment to play, but overall very strong.

Pros:
- Strong replayability with nice tactical decision making

Cons:
- My board doesn't sit flat on the table. Actually, after further playing, it is really really warped.
- The rulebook could use some revision.

The rating reflects my general desire to play the game solitaire (the only way it can be played).  I am always thinking about how to find time to play a few missions -- it is a vast improvement over Hornet Leader, although this comes at the cost of a bit more complexity.  The addition of the tactical map with terrain adds a welcome depth to the basic Air Leader system which prior to this simply had planes flying in, surviving anti-air fire and dropping bombs.  I also like that pilots are no longer tied to particular planes, which allows the system to model ongoing equipment damage as well as pilot stress.

Hornet Leader was good, but TAL is  great. The over-all feel and pacing of the game makes for a better experience. Hornet leader focused more heavily on planning and management over execution, while Tal balances the various game options a bit better. 

It does lose some detail and depth in the weapon and aircraft selection, but makes up for it in the battlefield resolution.

Challenging and tough decisions challenge you both off and on the battlefield. 

Which pilots to take? Which planes to choose? Which pilots and aircraft should do which missions? When? Costly weapons or cheap weapons? 

Should you take on the rear lines in a high stress mission to eliminate the negative traits of battalions making your life difficult or should you go after the rapid assault battalion on your doorstep? How should your pilots cover each other? Should they fly in from this hex or that hex? High or low altitude? Should you only weaken the enemy or destroy them? ....etc.. etc.. the list goes on.

This is a compelling and fun solo game. It's a little bit war game and a bit planning and crisis management board game.

edit: If you solo play this should be in your collection. Otherwise you should be ashamed and feel bad.

An amazing solitaire experience. Pick your missions, crew, aircraft, and loadouts, and go destroy the enemy. Watch as your pilots gain experience throughout the campaign, as well as your aircraft get filled with holes.

A great game that offers up lots of strategic choices to be made before throwing you into the hour-to-hour tactical decisions of flying your aircraft and rolling to destroy the enemy.

The only issue I have with this game is that it can be daunting to start. Before you move your aircraft around, you have to make TONS of choices. But in your first game or so you don't have any idea how those choice affect anything. It can be daunting, and requires you to just go for it and see how it plays before you can start making well-informed decisions.

Played once (so far) and technically lost horribly.  Threw all my units at the first mission (was supposed to play 2 missions), met 1/2 the victory conditions.  No friendlies shot down, but 1 got back to base with a Stress of 13.  I don't know if pilots/equipment would be ready for a 2nd mission in the campaign time.

But it was my first game.  I didn't expect to win.

Been really enjoying this. 

It features the usual, stellar, DVG components and a great rulebook to get you right off the ground (see what I did there?)

Each mission is filled with nail-biting decisions, through all phases of the game. Getting you're team together, planning the mission, executing it as quickly and violently as possible and dealing with the stress and wreckage once you have, hopefully, returned to the air base. 

It feels less like a puzzle, than most of the solitaire wargames I've played, and more like a story is unfolding as the enemy draws closer and closer, and your pilots become affected by the rigors of battle.

I've really enjoyed this. It is really fun to devise a plan and then see whether you can pull it off. The missions feel varied and the tension ebbs and flows. I particularly enjoy getting my pilots to the next higher skill level and then taking advantage of their new found skills.

After only 1 1/2 plays, this is a really good solitaire game. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I made some really amazing tactical errors, and paid the price for them. Which is great, because, this is not a trivial game, at least for an armchair airman like me. I saw that better decisions would make for better results, that statistical variation could reap the whirlwind or tank you quickly, but averages are true science, and the bad guys don't sit and wait for you to come for them. The detail is just enough for me. Unlike so many other Solitaire games, your decisions really do matter here. Play well, and you will likely do well. Play like me, and, at least, unlike real war, you can always take a do-over, and learn something new.

Great solitaire war+plane simulation game. If you like war games and/or warplanes, it is a must. Whole game is one clever system which works very well. Provides tons of gaming hours.

Downsides:

But again, game itself easily overcomes all of these, you have no other choice but buy it.

Based off a couple short campaigns, I believe this game is great. It's very different from Hornet Leader: Carrier Air Operations. But it doesn't replace it. The games are different enough and each is a great experience in its own right that there is ample reason to own & enjoy both.

TAL has more details & moving parts to keep track of than is present in HL:CAO. Gameplay seems slower as such, meaning I won't be able to get in as many missions of TAL as I would HL:CAO given an identical time frame. 

I like the separation of pilots from aircraft. That adds a whole new element to mission planning than was present in HL:CAO. Of course mission implementation is completely different from HL:CAO. It's nice to be down in the weeds, navigating terrain and destroying individual units. I also really appreciate the strategic element to the game with the advance of the enemy battalions toward my airbase. The aircraft damage system is great and adds further depth, narrative, and decision making to this game. 

I do have a few negative criticisms. I wish there were more pilots available. The pilot selection in HL:CAO is far greater than in TAL. I also wish there were more special condition and event cards present. The event deck in HL:CAO was much bigger than the deck in TAL. I'm hoping the decks don't become too bland with the frequency the cards will be circulated through. More battalions would be nice as well. In HL:CAO there are about 60 targets, I believe. There are far fewer battalions available in TAL. The campaign situations seem too short. Quite a few lie between 2-5 days. This is far shorter than in HL:CAO and doesn't allow the player to fully enjoy & utilize the pilot experience/skill aspect to the game as much as HL:CAO does. Kind of a bummer for a gamer like me who thrives off the long slog campaigns where you get to watch you pilots advance in skills & rank over a long campaign. Hopefully Dan will put out some additional situations that are longer than those included in the game.

I'm looking forward to trying out more campaigns and situations. I believe successful campaign evaluations will be harder to come by in TAL than they are in HL:CAO. TAL initially seems like it will be more challenging. There seems to be vast replayability to this game, just like in HL:CAO. I highly recommend this game as well as recommending HL:CAO.

Thunderbolt Apache Leader is a terrific solitaire wargame wherein the player recruits, builds, and arms his flight team for multi-part campaigns. While I may not always be in the mood to spend the major part of an hour setting up a game, this logical, well designed, beautifully packaged solitaire gem is probably the only solitaire game that I'd rank above Ambush!, Mage Knight, and D-Day at Omaha Beach, and the preparation does have the benefit of getting me invested in each particular squadron.

Thunderbolt Apache Leader has simple combat math, but a ton variables such as the changing maps, the various planes/choppers, the wide assortment of weapons, the varied types of defense, the specific types of aircraft damage, and the growing characters/pilots. Add to these factors the manner in which low altitude flying interacts with the terrain, how pilots handle those flights, how enemies scramble for cover, and how pilots get stressed out...and the narrative becomes very deep and detailed very quickly without feeling especially heavy.

The knocks that I have against the game are small. The set up time is really long, and the need to start aircraft inside the the hexes on the first move (rather than at the perimeter) seems a bit counterintuitive. Also, I like for game components to fully track all needed data--and not necessitate actual pencil and paper bookkeeping--but pencil and paper are needed here.

These are three minor gripes that keep the game from perfection for me, but at present, if I whittled my game collection down to one solitaire game, it would be this one. And if I whittled my collection down to one wargame, it would also be this one. Bravo, Dan Verssen and DVG games.

A very solid solitaire title that definitely makes me want to check out some of the other entries in the Leader series.  I appreciate the different aspects of a campaign, from resource management and operational decision-making to hard choices about the precise loadout of munitions.  Lots to explore here and I feel like I've barely scratched the surface.  Psyched to dive into some of the more advanced campaigns.

I do wish there were more rules for longer campaigns, some variety in the pilot artwork, and more counters for some of the 0-cost weapons (TOW missiles and small rocket pods in particular -- outfitting a cheap heli mission can be difficult.)

After playing eurogames for close to 4 years, I've decided to get back into wargaming and have started with TAL because of its solitaire nature. If it turns out well, there's lots of Leader games from DVG to work through. Have played the introductory Iraq campaign and am now playing through Libya. Initial rating of 7.

10 plays: Have finished three campaigns and am now more familiar with the sequence of play and plethora of weapons. I haven't yet become attached to the micro role playing aspects regarding pilot advancement. Maybe this will come when I play the longer campaigns. Stays at 7.

Again a title that was often named when discussion came to great solo-able or hard solo games. This one really interests me, because it has a cool preparation phase where you build your forces you want to throw at the scenario. And even though it is based on real world scenarios, it's powers and abilities remind me more of "True Lies" and Arnold Schwarzenegger hovering in a plane, shooting enemies, than it reminds me of real world conflicts. Still haven't brought it out, though.

Playing co-op with my son is great! Splitting the squadron down is lots of fun. Love the replay ability with this game.

Fine game, but not feeling myself drawn to it.  If I was over the learning curve, I probably would be.  But right now, if I'm in for a solo game, I think I want to be making more transparent decisions.  Only a few missions worth of experience, likely better with more.

I was a bit wary because of the chits and the MilSim genre. I feared that it would be overly complicated and too long. Boy was I wrong, this game is action packed, stressful (in a good way), and besides the minor amount time it took me to learn the weapons systems and aircraft, it's really pretty easy to get into. This game is a blast with tons of replayability. I am tempted to find a corner of my house, set it up and play a mission or two every chance I get and not really take this game down.

This game is amazing! It's packed with tense, meaningful decisions at every step of the game. TAL is by far my favorite solo board game I've ever played.

Really great solitaire/co-op wargame that feels like a complete step upward and forward for the line.

I have just finished the introductory campaign. This game is really awesome! When you exit the map leaving behind the smocking wrecks of the enemy, with all of your aircraft riddled with bullets and make it home in one piece you really want to scream "Yippee-ki-yay!!!!!"

Already a legend by the time I got my hands on a copy, a game that I resisted for so long because of the hype surrounding it, but I can say, without fear of retribution, that TAL is quite possibly the BEST solitaire game, period. The sheer amount of possibilities that come from not only eight different campaigns and six situations within those campaigns, but also managing one's aircraft, pilots, ordinance, and having to deal with a different map for each mission... It blows my mind! However, the game is not so random as to seem chaotic. Quite the contrary, I feel that the game feels quite structured, but not rigid. There is a fantastic fluidity to the design that is hard to describe, and I look forward to exploring and enjoying this wonderful game for many, many years!

Tactics, strategy, RPG, wargaming, solo, weaponry... Lots and lots of decision that matters. Recommended.
Actually, I can recommend for kids as well, since my 8-yr nephew play this game like an "adult". I mean, When he is playing it, he turns out to be more aged that he is, designing in his mind tough decisions to make like which aircraft I'm going to get for this specific mission and which pilot will fit. Yeah, it rocks to watch him!

I think this one pushes the game into new territory with progressive experience gained for your pilots and the whole tactical aspect of operations.  A new shining star for the Leader series.  I really like the inclusion of the AC-130.  Hats off to DVG.

Great game and so much fun! Feels a bit like a video game and has a challanging management aspect to it.
Recommended for eurogamers that want to try a wargame. Although the theme is wargame there is a lot of eurogame. A lot of management both long term (SO points which are your 'currency', order in which you fight battalions...) and immediate tactical gameplay when flying a mission (ie fighting a battalion).

The depth of this is astounding. I've always loved modern warfare and this gives it in spades. Unfortunately a game takes quite awhile so it doesn't get played as often as it would deserve.

More than just a zoomed in version of Hornet Leader this is a different experience.  More to the game in some ways as air frames and pilots are separate entities and there needs to be a lot more threat management as enemies are mobile and will advance toward the main base of operations. However targets are a lot softer and don't need the pounding that those in Hornet Leader do.

Another brilliant DVG game and a very worthy entry to the Leader series.

I do not really know what to think about that game. From a technical, system point of view, it is quite interesting. Managing resources points, pilots, aircrafts, ammunitions and campaign requirements is challenging, which is a good thing. But I feel that is becomes a bit repetitive since I guess that an optimal choice can be exploited in the end. The setup of every campaign is randomised, which means that replayability is very high. But some order cards make difficulty unreasonably high. Why not after all? There is some book keeping involved to record the results of the mission, but that is the flavour of the game and can be simplified with an Excel spreadsheet. The rules are presented in the chronological order of a game turn and are fairly easy to understand and remember. However the player needs to remember that several of the cards in play alter them and I confess that it is one of my weak points.
On the down side, the quality of the components is not up to the price tag. I am not a fan of satin finish for the boards and the graphic design of the pilot, aircraft cards and of the counters lacks imagination. The hex tiles are nice though.
In the end, it is a pleasant game. The choice of the campaign impacts the length of the game, but longer campaign may become dead ends fairly early if a mission turns sours. Anyway, since the goal is to score the highest number of victory points, it is always possible to try again or tweak the initial squad to beat one's personal best. I could recommend it to those who enjoy modern warfare but it is an expensive game. It is a clever mix of boardgame and wargame that can appeal to both categories of fans.

Reviews on this one lured me into buying my first solitaire game and hope it hasn't set my expectations too high for the next one!  Excellent game... a tad pricey, else I'd give it a 10, but an excellent game.

Dan Verssen proves with Thunderbolt Apache Leader that it is possible to design a solitaire system with ALL the following characteristics:

1) doesn't drain all the player's brainpower to run
2) doesn't rub gamey and unnatural elements in player's face at every occasion
3) rewards strategy and planning as opposed to just reacting to the solitaire engine
4) is challenging but not unfair
5) has enough depth to enable player's skill improvement through a learning process
6) creates a unique narrative every time you play
7) can be played with few glances in the rulebook.

Lovely modern military theme, beautiful components (even with some embarrassing typos and layout errors), intuitive gameplay, not too long a playing time.

The only reasons I'm not rating this a 10 have to do with 1) the enormous amount of die rolling involved and 2) the difficulty. Difficulty is not necessarily a problem by itself, mind you - it just feels a little unthematic when half the aircraft in your high tech US squadron take an epic beating in the introductory Iraq invasion scenario.

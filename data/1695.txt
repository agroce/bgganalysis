It does a nice job of capturing much of the Robin Hood story: robbing from the rich to give to the poor, fighting Little John, Will Scarlet, and Friar Tuck, recruiting Merry Men, freeing captives, marrying Maid Marion, using disguises, winning the archery tournament -- it's all there.  The game is easy and captures so much.  A really nice find and a hidden gem.

Cardboard chits, extensive lookup tables and arcane rules. A Proper Board game from when 'modern Euro' probably referred to Italian fashion designs. Rule 15.3 'Bigamy Prohibition' remains my favourite rule of all time.

RATING: 6
As AH managed to release two almost identically named games in the 80s and  90s (the other is called Legends of Robin Hood) this is the earlier one in the small box with an archer, backed by a forest of trees, firing an arrow in your general direction.

I have the original OSG version which came in a plastic sleeve instead of a box.  This is quite a good game with some interesting mechanics involving the recruiting of Merry Men and in creating the more interesting incidents in the legend.

Unfortunately the game lacks variation and becomes very "samey" after around 20 plays.

A few balance problems.  If the sherrif gets lucky early he can do some serious damage -- otherwise by the end of the game he's pretty much guaranteed to be holed up in castles hoping for a lucky break while the outlaws go ravaging through the countryside.

A game that allows you to rewrite the story of Robin Hood. Unfortunately it isn't as much fun as it should be. The Merry Men can't really launch surprise attacks as there is no hidden movement and all the action seems to take place around the centre of the map, making the larger part of the board superfluous.

RATING: 8
A really unique, thematic, and easy-to-play game that demonstrates a pretty interesting way of using wargame mechanics to model a very nontraditional conflict- Robin Hood and his Merry Men against the Sherrif of Nottingham and his cronies!  It's really just a neat game with a cool narrative- Robin Hood starts out recruiting and rallying other insurgents (strangely reminiscent of the first stage of a game of WAR OF THE RING) and then proceeding to stage hit-and-run robberies on bishops and nobles that move via a simple automation system.  The Sheriff player gets to tax villages and even hang captured leaders, all the while trying to provide escort to the hapless marks wandering Sherwood.  There's a lot of fun detail, such as one of the victory conditions requiring Robin Hood to marry Maid Marian in the presence of Friar Tuck and Alan A'Dale or the classic archery contest called on Nottingham Green.  There's a lot going on strategically and tactically for such a simple game and my biggest criticism is probably that some of the rules are a little vague and it does seem like it could be a little scripted- but other than that, this is really a fun, very small box game that promises a good 1-2 hours worth of pure entertainment.

One of the best small games of that era - captures the legends perfectly.  Loads of very cool chrome in the rules, allowing for plenty of flavour and variety - secret tunnels into castle keeps; daring rescues; public hangings; regicide; taxation of villages; the archery contest; robbing nobles and bishops en route through the shires; brutal skirmishes and hasty escapes, and more!  
Nice components considering the 'micro' format - rules are surprisingly light considering the possibilities (see above).  

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
2-player game with theme out the yin-yang.  This one is underrated.  I'd rate higher if the rules were just a wee bit clearer.  The main rule that was left out is...what happens when there are survivors from both sides in the same (non-castle) square after archery and melee?  Still, it is one of my favorite 2 player games.

Tentative rating based on an aborted game:

Seems like a fun low-density wargame. With only a few units per side, this one whips along at a fast pace. The base rules are quite simple, but the chrome-ey contingencies turn the rules into a bit of a fiasco for a game with about 30 chits! Best rule ever: "Rule 15.3: The Bigamy Prohibition!"... man these old games are awesome.

A game based on some tried and true wargame mechanics but a lot of character and Robin Hood legend thrown in there. The downside is two player and it is a bit antiquated.

Surprisingly elegant and engaging design. On the first turn, the Sheriff has some choices to make: attack Robin right away for a chance of a quick win or strong advantage, but at the risk of being out of position and losing some men at arms that he needs; or playing for the long run and pulling back to build up his forces, harass Robin's allies, and wait for a better chance to trap Robin.

The better of the Robin Hood games (published by OSG in 1979, republished by Avalon Hill in 1982).  It's a superior two-player game suitable for war-gamers, and not to be confused with the fairly simple multi-player card-based game suitable for children, "Legends of Robin Hood (1991)".

I bought my copy on ebay and it was unpunched and still in the shrinkwrap. I love the theme. I really like the map board and the ruleset, though, admittedly, it can be a little overwhelming at first. The combat is pretty old school, do-math-and-consult-charts, but I love all of the strategic options and things you can do in this game: robbing travelers, capturing (and possibly hanging) leaders, rescuing leaders, looting castles, marrying Maid Marion, participating in an archery contest, recruiting Merry Men, etc. I also like the way your short term goals may change based on what new personalities arrive on the scene. Great game. I only hope that I can get my wife to keep playing it with me.

I got it with a subscription to a magazine and played it a lot.
Not funny, not easy. Very thematic.
You can marry Lady Marion, take part in the Archers Contest... but there are a lot of mini rules to remember (such as archers not shooting on the turn after they pass a river).
I recall that the game is "broken" because the Sheriff has wide chances to capture Robin Hood on the very second game, as a consequence of a not-so-hard dice roll.

I own the OSG version and have played the AH version (once.) In that game, the Robin Hood player left RH a bit too close, and I swooped in, killed his accompanying Merry Men and took him prisoner. When I returned to the castle and garrisoned it with a strong force, it was apparent that he couldn't get enough troops and leaders there in time to mount a successful rescue before I could hang him. So we called it early (game turn 8, I think.)

So I think I learned two things from this aborted play:

1. The RH player must, above all else, keep Robin from getting cornered and/or within range of any decent-sized stack. The Sheriff player will and should [i]always [/i]take any shot at getting RH, even if the odds are fairly low.

2. The game has a lot of potential if the RH player avoids the disaster scenario described above. There's a lot going on here--raids, taxes, murder, capture, hit-and-run, recruitment, marriage, rescue, knights, princes, archery competitions--and a lot of it seems like pretty good stuff if the game goes on long enough.

I'd definitely play again, now that a test drive has identified a couple of crucial tactics.

RATING: 6.75
Pretty fun game, some decisions, but are you screwed in Friar Tuck or some of the personalities are killed!  Also, the game start is critical for Robin not to get knocked unconcious or something, else the game goes fast.  Not any room in the box for dice, which is funny.  Such a small box from Avalon Hill but a decnt amount of game.

It's an okay game.  There is a goofy condition where the capture of Robin Hood would not end the game at the decision of the Sheriff.  Not sure why anyone would ever do that.

Light and chaotic game which doesn't have the most polished of gameplay, but makes up for it with the theme. Want to force Maid Marion to marry Guy of Gisbourne?

Want to have an archery contest on Nottingham Green? All of these things can be found in this strange little game.

Excellent! Very elegant mechanics which favor thoughtful planning and finesse movement rather than overwelming force. This is a gamer's game where the theme supports the framework of the game nicely.

Brilliant game for two people. The many different tactics, that can prove succesful is the main reason I like it.

I have the original small box game. Enjoyable, with a low unit density.

My print and play version looks fantastic, but I still haven't gotten it to the table.  The game seems very intimidating, and I'm worried about playing such a dated game.

Great game.  I spent too much time playing this many years ago.  Perhaps a bit too "wargammy" for many folks, but it is fast moving and captures the spirit of Robin Hood.

Not sure what happened with this one, but it was a fun game I played with my son a lot.  I think the wife pitched it, but she won't say.  Small box and nice for travel, pretty uncomplicated.

A Great and most importantly fun simulation of the robin hood mythos. IT's cool how the merry men can just barely escape in so many ways. 'To the castle!' 
'Retreat out the back way!' Grert fun.

Played it once.  If you're a Robin Hood fan, you'll enjoy it.  Otherwise, why bother?

RATING: 8
Very, very cool.  Robin Hood if it was a wargame.  Mechanics are a bit dated, but overall strategic feel is quite modern.  The dynamic of trying to chase Robin around the board is great.  A great game of unequal forces and unequal objectives.  The thematic flourishes are great, adding all kinds of flavor without making it too complicated.  Also, there are a lot of subtle rules to make the Sheriff and Robin behave as they did in the stories, with Robin ruling the woods, and the Sheriff ruling the forts. So much great stuff from the legends.  Duels!  Secret passages!  Daring rescues!  Archery tournaments!  It's hard to imagine a better treatment of the Robin Hood legend in a board game.

Not a bad game, it manages to convey the pace and feeling of the Robin Hood story, which in itself is a remarkable accomplishment. Check out the excellent UniversalHead graphic redesign.

Nice 'put in your pocket', 'bring along everywhere' game. You feel the age of the design, but that is part of the charm to me.

Old war game with Robin Hood and Sheriff of Nottingham against each other. Low unit count so first die rolls are significant.

I made PnP version. My wife is not into war games, so never sees light of day.

Our first foray into war games. Enjoyed the aspect of feeling in the roles of Robin Hood or the Sheriff of Nottingham. The basic rules are understandable, catching all the little ones is tougher, but doable. Look forward to our next game which will be less of just learning and more getting into the strategy.

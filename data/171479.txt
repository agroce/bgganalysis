Got this one from Kickstarter. I'd love to play it more, but it doesn't make it to the table too much. It's also one of the more difficult coop games I've played. I do really like their anti-quarterbacking rules, though.

Though there are similarities, it's not THAT much like Pandemic like I heard.  Super thematic, well balanced, and nice components.

RATING: 8.5
I must say I'm a bit underestimated the game as it's both Christian themed and co-operative. I started with a 6-players game plus the adversary, and result was the apostles couldn't even reach Rome while the Roman legend entered Judea!
The second game was also 6-players but without the Romans, it's smooth but still we lacked time to spread the good news to Rome(though we did collect the New Testaments).
Comments: 
1. the components are nice(especially the board with the extinguished tiles), but I'm considering to replace the missionaries by the apostles and then substituted the apostles by those featured meeples already owned;
2. the game is challenging especially for family game players, and should be attractive to both Christians and non-Christians;
3. new players should pay attention to John's power and the timing to use the power.

A beautiful game both in play and looks; and rather unique for a cooperative in that the Alpha Gamer phenomenon is largely crushed. With the various scenarios and levels of play, Commissioned has a lot of replay  value. 

Just a couple of complaints: the iconography is challenging at times, and I think text on the Trial cards would have been a better choice. The rulebook, sadly, leaves a LOT to be desired! Even a Table of Contents would have made a world of difference!

Played this at MeepleCon 2017.  The theme is the apolstles of Jesus Christ spreading the gospel after His death.  It's reminiscent of Pandemic, except you try to create the outbreaks. The event cards are persecution, disbelief, etc. that hinders the spread of the gospel.  I rather liked it, though the rules were not the clearest.

Played this thanks to IGA and it was better than I expected. It's a faith-based theme which can sometimes be corny or lame,  BUT I found this game to be a genuinely solid game with interesting features and mechanics, nice overall graphics and a good level of challenging co-op play for my own preferences. Not too hard, not too simple. 
I also appreciated that there was a really nice balance of historical feel (visually and content-wise) enhanced by the Biblical background info for those who are interested in the foundations of the theme that tie into the Roman Empire's role in the game.
Really enjoyed it, ordered it on Amazon that same night.

I'm not a big fan of co-op games, but this game works quite well. The turn mechanism (elder) helps prevent alpha player problems. The deck building function fits nicely and does a good job of allowing the different starting player abilities to continue to be customized throughout the game. It might be nice to see what card options we have to buy, rather than purchasing blind, but it does work as is. The game is better than I expected; fans of co-op games should check it out.

RATING: 6
The Apostle's theme is strong and magnified by the cooperative nature of the game (and historically justified theme appendix). The mini deck building mechanic is interesting, and the 'Elder Staff' successfully mitigates quarterbacking and helps draw equal input from all players. I also appreciate the progressive nature of the game. Players start small, but slowly begin to permeate the surrounding regions, which is a nice change from the fire stomping of Pandemic. But, despite this strong base, Commissioned is begging for more. The 'Pray' cards are very limited, in both variety and quantity, and don't provide a lot of variability, especially at higher player counts. Who'd've thought a Christian themed, cooperative, deck building game would ever be published, let alone be any good?

I wonder how authentic it is in regards to Church history. One thing I noticed is that saints' names are missing the "Saint" in their title. I am hesitant about this game, but willing to play it.  Curious about how Protestants would deal with the first pope,Holy Mass, and the question of authority in making this game.

Cooperative game of spreading the faith in the early Christian church.  Theme is pretty well integrated and the trial deck creates challenges which need to be overcome. 

Strong deck-building element, where you draw your hand (hand size varies with player count) and play your cards in secret and then all reveal.  A single player the decides which cards of the potential set get played each turn which makes for intereting choices in when to play your stronger cards.  After a set number of rounds that varies on player count, you use your remaining cards to purchase new cards.

Multiple scenarios, victory conditions are based around moving enough population to open churches across the Roman Empire and playing cards which represent the New Testament.

After several challenging and unsuccessful plays, we finally figured out a rule we'd been playing wrong. Since then, we've actually won a few games! I haven't gotten to experience anything beyond the first scenario, but look forward to exploring this some more. I'm not sure that the current deck offers enough variety for extended play, but I'm hoping the other scenarios will help with that. If not, that will be too bad, as I'd really like for this game to do well.

I played this solo and controlled 2 characters. I really liked the mechanism in this game of growing the church. It sort of reminded me of when you play Risk and you are spreading across the board with your massive army trying to consume everything in your wake. The difference being, of course, that you are spreading the Gospel rather than destroying everybody  This is a solid cooperative game with interesting mechanisms that I haven't seen in other cooperative games. I enjoyed it quite a bit!

Very thoughtfully themed and well-designed game mechanics in a genre really lacking in quality non-trivia based games.

We've only played the first mission so far, on both easy and hard difficulty, with only 2 players.  We love it, though I suspect it would play better with more people.  It is primarily a mix of deck building and an "anti-pandemic" system where more cubes is good rather than bad.  I look forward to playing the other missions as well as finding a larger group to try it with.

2017-10-02: Rating up from 8 to 9.  Played with 4 players this weekend, first mission on hard mode.  It was more dynamic (harder) than with two players because it's harder to keep all the apostles camped out under protection of the Convert Leaders card.  With 6 players it should be even harder, but I haven't tried that yet.

RATING: 7.8
Backed this midway through my first demo!  Very surprised 1) that the theme didn't detract from the play tempo and decision making, and 2) the variety of mechanics smoothly integrating into a fully functional and fresh game.  Play it with knowledge of the first century church, you're going to appreciate the struggle. Play it with little or no knowledge of Christianity and you are still fretting if the right decision was made, especially deep into the game.  This will see play as an alternative to struggle games like Dead of Winter and Pandemic because of ease in teaching it, time involvement and a just deep enough diplomatic component to keep everyone engaged.

Excellent game, although more challenging than it appears. There is definitely a learning curve, and new players should first read the Trial cards in order to know what to expect. For instance, don't leave an Apostle in a region containing multiple 1-member churches; otherwise, the Trial may make it an instant game over! Some Apostles are definitely better early game (e.g. Andrew, Peter) while others seem stronger late game (James, John). Where the game lacks is in terms of predictability, given that we will use all Trial cards throughout a game. Therefore, if we know the cards, we can predict what will be the last Trial... which is not necessarily a good thing. More Trial cards should have been provided, to introduce some uncertainty.

Found this game to be quite engaging, both in theme and in gameplay. It has the challenging aspects of pandemic, where it's easy to lose. I really enjoy the extra materials that come with this game to tell more about the time period and the biblical connections to the game. 

while it can be hard to get a group together to play this game based off the theme, it's definitely worth trying a few times. the gameplay itself is really well done and thought out.

This is another co-op that is very hard. It offers amazing mechanics and theme with 5 different scenarios that play very different. I would almost prefer playing this game over Pandemic if it wasn't for one factor. The game takes about an hour and a half to play. If this game played closer to an hour I would always play this over Pandemic. You can check my full review on Amazon.***

RATING: 7
Mechanically, this game plays like a reverse Pandemic with a small deck building aspect attached. That really does not do justice to Commissioned, but that's the best way I can find to describe the way it works.

In Commissioned, you are trying to spread the influence of the Early Church by sending out missionaries and causing the local churches to spread all while the forces of evil try to stop you by killing off the Christians and stomping out the local churches. If you lose too many churches or the event deck runs out before you've gained enough board influence and collected enough written works, it's game over.

Each player selects one of the Apostles and takes the associated starter deck, which is all copies of the exact same card. This gives each player a single default action that they can almost always do, no matter how many cards they add to their deck. Some of these are really, really good, to the point of being almost necessary to achieve a win, and others are mediocre. None of the powers are outright bad, but there's definitely some that are much better than others. To have a good chance of winning, you really need enough players to get a good selection of powers in play. If playing with only 2 or 3 players, I usually would suggest that each player takes half of a starter deck from two different Apostles so that you have access to more abilities.

After that, it's just a matter of dealing with hardships as they arise from the deck, getting enough movement to cover the board, and digging for the right cards to complete the collection sets. There's a lot going on, but it's pretty easy to learn. The restrictions in the game rules and the setbacks you face from the events are where you find the difficulty, and this game can sometimes feel like classic Nintendo Hard. It's lots of fun though, and I definitely recommend giving it a try if you like cooperative games such as Pandemic.

An excellent cooperative game - with simple mechanics of limiting communication - with a very good immersive factor.
Playing on maps inspired by Roman ones is really a nice experience.
The game plays elegantly, once the order of play is acquired.
Each player is an apostle, with specific abilities.
No need to know anything about Christianity to enjoy Commissionned.

I enjoyed this game better than Pandemic, which it is sort of the opposite of. Instead of destroying viruses, you are spreading the gospel. As you play, you will develop your own card deck. This makes me feel I have a lot more control in the game than Pandemic, which is more random.

As a design, Commissioned is only OK. It gets a little repetitive and feels just a bit mild for my tastes. But I really appreciate the way it handles its subject matter. It's a tastefully Christian game that approaches its subject with a light but earnest touch. I also wish more eurogames would approach historical material, so in that sense it represents something I'd like to see more of.

Outstanding game for the family. Great theme worked out through a combination of mechanics that go well together in this game. These include worker placement, deck building, and coop with designated leader role - each of these in good measure for effect and balance. 

There are a number of scenarios as well as a couple of different levels to play on. Also there are a number of distinctions between numbers of players. So it's one I'll be coming back to play with different combinations of friends and numbers of family members.

It's also the first and only game I participated in kickstarting so far. It met every stretch goal and delivered with very nice components - early!

A solid medium-weight game with a lot of historical theme. It does not preach at you but it might educate you about the trials of the early Church and could form the basis for some interesting discussions around the table.

Co-op historical deck-builder. Several scenarios. All vs. 1 variant. Unique starting deck for each role. Double-sided board. Sounds replayable to me! 

A good value for the price, especially considering the included historical material and top-rate production quality.

Great game.

I think that the subject matter may have squelched overall interest but this game is solid.

The mechanics are great. 

The game is challenging and aggravating, and surprising at times.

The artwork is Euro-style, which I'm not terribly fond of but it is done well.

As a christian, I maybe considered biased and that influences the score higher. You're one of the early church disciples/ apostles spreading the gospel of Jesus Christ!

Ratings (1 to 5):

Simplicity: 4
--> Relatively easy to learn, there are just a few things to remember mainly regarding legal movement and a handful of unusual situations.

Depth: 2
--> Relative to your middle of the road, average Euro, complexity is on the low side.  There is some thinking involved, but once you learn the basic algorithm/"tricks", the decisions are not deep.  The total number of actions to chose from in a particular round is fairly small.  Luck via the Trial cards also have a big impact, especially if certain cards come at an inopportune time (like a Mission stop at the very beginning) and can ruin a well-thought out strategy (especially if the more difficult Trial cards are added to the game).

Player Interactivity: 2
--> When I think of player interactivity in the co-op sense, it traditionally comes from “you own this” and “I own that” and together we are finding a way to used those privately owned resources in a cooperative way to achieve a common goal.  Your own resources and independent decisions “interact” with others, which provides meaningful tension.  However, in this game nothing is really “owned” per se -- *everything* is shared and can be used by other players (e.g., any piece on the board can be moved, cards in one player’s possession can be used by another player).  It’s like you are all playing with the same bucket of resources, which in a sense makes the game TOO communal and as a result the player interaction is a bit shallow and boring.  Like multiple people playing a single solitaire game.

Theme: 4
--> The Theme Appendix that gives background historical information on the Trial card events helps to immerse oneself in the early Christian movement theme.  The different Apostle characters and cards also help.  The actions themselves (such as move, grow, remove that stop, etc.) are fairly generic though and only loosely tied to theme. 

Fast-Moving: 4
--> Turns move fairly fast though there can be a little AP to set up your church member population distribution so that you don’t get screwed by certain Trial cards that you know are coming up.

Replayability: 2
--> Each scenario starts the same, and once you find an optimal path to spread the church/achieve your goal you are likely to follow that every game.  Also, the turns feel a bit samey and repetitive after a while, as you tend to repeat the same basic strategies over and over each turn.  Different scenarios and different characters mix it up a bit, but unfortunately this doesn't stave off the eventual monotony within each individual game.

In sum, if you are looking for a relatively light strategic game (with a heavy luck element), it might be worth buying, but only if you are really wanting a religious themed game in your collection.  It's hard to categorize this as a serious gamer's game, but at the same time, it is likely too heavy and difficult for a casual gamer.

I was a little concerned about the theme of this game, but it was extremely well made and the game mechanics are excellent.  We all enjoyed playing this game.

Thoroughly engaging co-op with mechanisms (progression of evil like Pandemic, deck building) that fit together extremely well.  There are even die rolls that will force one player to make all the calls in a round.  Satisfying every time I play, win or lose.

Kickstarted.

I first played this game at my first gaming convention, Geekway to the West 2015. My wife and I have been loving all the co-op games that have come out, so I was immediately interested in a Christian themed one. Although, I have played many Christian themed games only to be bored by the lackluster game play. Commissioned to the rescue.

Take the Bible history theme away from this and you still have a solid game. Tough decisions, Event cards that make you change what you thought you were going to do, and an actually Christian History theme!!!!! I am awestruck!!!

I played a game with my high school game club. (I loved sneaking in a little Christianity!!!) We thought for sure we were losing. One miracle card later we won the game with 2 turns left.

The next game came down to the last card and we pulled out the victory.

The next game came down to the last card and the trial ruined us.

This game has the Pandemic-feel of coming down to the end and not knowing if you won.

Looking forward to attempting the other stories included in the game!

The use of theme is absolutely brilliant in this game.  I don't know how to describe it without going into super long detail, but one example that I love is that a trial card of persecution will cause you to lose members but also spread the gospel to other cities, just like in history/real life.  The whole game is like that.  Just perfect.

This game is really clever. Imagine playing pandemic where instead of a CDC scientist you are the virus. And imagine that you use a deck-building mechanism to build your power. That's this game except instead of a virus you are an apostle trying to spread a new religion (Christianity) to the ancient Roman world. 

Yes the theme is Christianity. No, it does not attempt to convert you. The theme is actually perfect for the game mechanics.

If you are a Christian board-gamer, this game is a no-brainer; unless you just detest co-ops.

If you aren't a religious bigot, this is still a no-brainer.

My playgroup loves this game. Please note that we are Christian, so the theme was desirable. The game is a combination of a Settlers of Catan (as far as expanding your territories - to spread the Word), Dominion (deck-building component that effects board conditions, or accumulates the New Testament), Pandemic (a cooperative game with a deck of cards - Trials - that work against the Apostles), and Agricola (limited choices per turn based on what cards are made available from each players deck). As with any co-op game, more players makes winning easier.

After multiple plays I finally won the Acts of the Apostles scenario they recommend to start with, after having played the 2nd scenario of Peter's missionary journey I disagree.

Peter's scenario makes for a much better beginner game.  
Overall the game is fantastic, but it offers a steep learning curve.  If you start with the Peter scenario it is much more accessible.  We had easy success with Peter and Andrew.

This is a decent game. It's a mix between a deck-builder and a co-op.

Two to six Apostles in a co-op to spread Christianity from Jerusalem AND write the books of the New Testament before running out of easy or difficult trials and before five churches are exhausted. Area expansion with a deck builder element. I'm intrigued by the hidden faith card reveal from all players that determines the actions for the round. The lead role as the Elder passes each round similar to Robinson Crusoe. The snuffed candle tiles is a nice dramatic touch when a church is exhausted. I also really appreciate the added effort to provide historical/educational background of the cards in the reference guide in a similar manner as Neanderthal...which is an ironic comparison :)

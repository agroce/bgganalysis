+ Great. It has everything I was hoping for on my first "heavy wargame". It feels real, exciting and rewarding. 
- The rulebook's a mess. Some scenarios are a lot more interesting than others. Individual combat is almost irrelevant.

I've been a big fan of the Great Battle's of History series throughout the 90's.  While the original system was a bit overly complicated, I completely fell in love while playing the computerized versions of the games by I-magic.  (If you can find them in the bargain bins at your software dealer, GET "Great Battles of Alexander, Hannibal, and Caesar.")This latest version of the GBoH series takes the 'fast play' version of the rules that they had created, tweaks it up some to deal with the vagaries of Renaissance era combat, and sets it loose.  A VERY tight little game- I need to play more than I have.One very nice little chrome addition is the competition for heads (yes, HEADS-ie, that you decapitate).  Winning individual duels is, in many ways, as important to winning as the battle itself.  And forcing the right General into an affair of honor that right time..........Other games, like Fields of Glory, are probably a bit less fiddly, and possibly cleaner in their gameplay.  (There are still a fair amount of markers in this game)  That said, GBoH really gives a GREAT feel for Warring States combat that is epic in scope, but yet playable in an afternoon- My buddy Nate and I played a game almost to conclusion in about 2.5 hours, and that was spending the first hour and a half going over the rules.Not recommended for someone who is 'starting out' in Ancients- but for someone who is a fairly serious Ancients gamer but is looking for something is a bit 'faster', this is highly recommneded.

GBoH with decapitation.  Maps have lots of terrain compared to other games in the series and as such offer more of a tactical challenge.  Samurai rules rule.

RATING: 7
The designers have done a good job reflecting the peculiarities of the era & region with the rules set. I dig the emphasis on individual combat of leaders and holding some of the best units close to the So-taisho. The latter really gives you a feel for the  political climate of the era by forcing the player to role play the So-taisho as a self serving warlord rather than an altruistic leader - very cool. The time to play is manageable once you get the flow of the phases of each round committed to memory and if I can do it anyone can do it. My singular complaint is the lack of solo compatability. I bought the game to play solo and I would rate it considerably lower than a 7 for a solo game because of the amount of decision making that one must engage in for the imaginary opponent.

I'm conflicted about this game. I've only played it solo so far and it has seemed more of an interesting exercise than a game.  I really like the flavor and simulation, but it gets a little bogged down with nuance and the apparent historical integrity means some of the battle outcomes are quite difficult to alter (at this point I'm only assuming it can be done).

"For those who have never played a historical simulation... After about 20-30 minutes [following along with the manual] you'll be just as good at this thing as we are."

That's a severe understatement. The rule book is very frustrating, lacks flow, and contains an incomplete terms list. I'm currently on my second notes revision trying to trim the fat and create some logic. At this point I can only claim a partial understanding and suspect it's mostly the abundance of chrome and exceptions that weigh down the rules. You will most likely need to print out Tweaksy's flowchart at the very minimum.

Components are plentiful but rushed. Concept and money spent are the only things that keep me interested in finally learning Ran.

Interesting game that creates a lot of really great narrative during the battles. Unfortunately the rules are a complete disaster. The more I play it the more issues I find, the last scenario alone needs an entire page of errata (yet to surface).

If some more errata is released which fixes the major problems I'll bump this up to an 8. Heres hoping.

I am biased having been one of the playtester for this one. The battle are interesting and the situation varied. Japanese way of war is differently from the western one and they lack the huge different troop type of other GBOH games, but the resulting battles are neverthless fascinating.

Great Game from GMT (as usual)

RATING: 6
Oh god... the rules. I played 2 scenarios thinking hey, this'll get better the more I played it. I was still none the wiser about some issues regarding engagement and facing change. I might come back to it one day and take another run at it.

EDIT: so I revisited this over a period of several months, and have now played all but the last scenario Tenoji. It's not as bad a game as I originally thought and I've upped my rating from a 4 to a 6, because although I still think the rules are badly presented and unnecessarily fiddly and clunky for the level of detail you get, I managed to enjoy myself in spite of them.

RATING: 9
As my buddy Al has proved time and again, you can get hosed in this game through untimely die rolls - but it's still a blast! What other game lets you collect the severed heads of your enemies? What other game punishes those who withdraw from battle with the threat of seppuku? Impressive integration of theme and mechanics.

My second foray into the Great Battles of History series. Better production values than the older SPQR which I have really enjoyed, but still in my view there is a lack of clarity in the rules' presentation/writing. Investing a little time in understanding the rules is worth it though (and part of the fun is to try to discern the designers' intent). 
I love the theme and the artwork, and the rules on Samurai and individual combat add to the flavour. One scenario attempted so far, but I like how the rules provide a relatively swift and flowing experience, very different from the more ordered lines I'm used to in SPQR. I love this series, and I think I'll be investing in more of its offerings!

I bought this game over a year ago and lemme tell ya this: I should have just read Asur's session reports for RAN here on BGG and I would have been satisfied.  As a father of two very young children this game will not be played by me for a very long time.

Ain't nobody got time for that. Normally, I absolutely love learning rules for a new game, but Ran's rules are a mess, and even if I could keep them all straight, I'm skeptical that I could sort through the complexity and meaningfully explore strategies. Too hardcore for me.

I recognize that, quite possibily, there is a good game inside this historical simulation, but I just couldn't manage to get to know its complex rules to be able to find it. A heavy wargame only for the experienced Grognards out there who are fans of the Samurai era.

RATING: N/A
RAN is the 12th volume in the Great Battles of History Series, and the second game on the battles of the Samurai (following GMTs Samurai (Vol. V). RAN covers several of the less famous battles of the Sengoku Jidai, in which powerful Daimyo - Japanese feudal lords - strove to both maintain and extend their power bases while seeking to attain the office of Shogun, the power behind the throne of the Emperor.

RAN simulates the highly personal form of warfare developed by the Japanese samurai, wherein formal battles played out almost as backdrops to individual feats of courage, bravery, and devotion--much of it outstanding, some of it rather foolhardy, all of it very Homeric. Although political and tactical victory was the bottom line, collecting the severed heads of enemy samurai reigned a very close second in importance. In terms of tactics, this was, as in Europe, the Dawn of Modern Warfare, with the introduction of guns - arquebuses - by the Portuguese. Even with the revelatory effect of musketry, Japanese battles were still pretty much a swirling, non-linear affair.

Probably a good and immersive simulation, if one is already familiar with GBoH. The ruleset is certainly one of the worst in my (ponderous) collection, full of confusing partial redundancies and ambiguities. Rules difficulties aside, this is very much a game that plays the players: do I want to digest and struggle through such a set of rules to have a game which is highly likely to be determined by a few contingent flight rolls? I think not. Might make for engaging solo play, though.

After understanding the rules, the game is fairly easy. One of those games where it helps to understand why a rule exists and what it's trying to simulate. However, a bit too "fiddly" for me.

I think if you like the period and setting, it's an excellent game and system. So, would probably give an 8 but again, too "fiddly" as a game.

Found it at CSI,  I think it was part of the Dice Tower Conventions CSI Dent and Ding sale they do every year, but they sold it for almost full price(ugh, again I have no proof just my own speculation, but the box corner is a bit damaged and it just "happened" to become availible after the Dice Tower Convention was over.  Again I have no proof, but my what a "conincidence", CSI should sell games as dent and ding and offer them to the public year round at reduced prices.  Still glad to have it considering it is OOP everywhere but ebay, good luck getting it still for the price I paid.

RATING: 7
Fanciful renditions of some obscure Samurai battles. Each scenario has a different feel by expanding or contracting the number of units. One has two factions of over thirty units. Another from one to eight. Even though this a scaled-down Great Battles of History game, it still feels bloated in areas, incomplete elsewhere. There's some unnecessary chrome here, some is interesting, the individual combat can be fun or tiresome depending on your mood for trying to out-roll your opponent over several iterations.

Do not play a 4 player game with the proposed number of Buildings, since there are to few spaces on the board to support them. The game drags till a much to late end.

It's an okay family game. Lot's of token-management and the tokens often run out of stock. This could have been better solved by personal rating boards. Because of the nice artwork it's a weak 6 in my opinion. Otherwise I would have rated it a 5.

Meduris is admittedly a game which may hold (much?) more potential than I give it credit for in that it keeps on tightening the thumb screws on the players right to the very end, when a substantial VP correction takes place before the final score is established. Although calculable, it's quite opaque because of the unknown resource distribution and the location of the druid when the game is finally called, and thus suggests various approaches which may or may not work. Filling in gaps right at the end will be exceedingly costly for those going later in this process. Creating larger buildings earlier on invites temples to come out early and so tranfers VPs to the opposition. I'm not [i]sure[/i] if it works out in the end, but the potential that it will is certainly there. And that's surprising.

However, what really got up my nose about it all was the incessant, mind-numbing back-and-forth of resources from stock to supply. A die rolled at the beginning of each player's turn determines a bonus resource (or sometimes a malus), and then you move resources to the supply in case of building things, then some more because of the druid demanding them; or you obtain resources by stacking your worker meeples in a rickety ordered towers which are easily upset. Half the game's (if not more!) time is spent manipulating small amounts of chits, which is patently ridiculous. This ought to have been a little private board of sorts with markers... were it not for the fact that the supply is limited, and that players must verify your payments to the general stock. This can only be accomplished by an open system, immediately lessening the family aspect. (If this was a family game to begin with, I hasten to add.) I would be curious to find out how it plays in an electronic version which would deal with all interface aspects plaguing the boardgame.

In summary: game is curious, artwork is nice and evocative, but the physical handling is murder.

Après s'être bien mis sur la face avec Inis, restons dans le thème du druidisme celtique avec Meduris. Il est temps de faire la paix. Du coup, les druides construisent un grand village en cercle et vont prier les dieux ensemble. Rapidement, les rivalités reviennent et que moi j'ai une plus grande colonie, et que mon temple, il ramène plus de fidèle, et que j'te pique ta pierre runique. Meduris est un jeu de gestion assez simple (il y a un dé, horreur, il y a un Dé !) où il faudra construire des colonies en cercle, mais plus il y en a, plus ca coûte cher.

I don't usually rate games after just one play, but something about it has me wanting to play it again. It was just... pleasantly clean and think-y.

Very nice gateway weight game. The components are great and the game looks really nice. Turns are very fast as you just roll the dice and do an action. It's nice with 2 but I suspect it will play better with more players.

RATING: 6
Fine game with a decent amount of strategy, but absolutely themeless. The only element of luck is the small gain (or sometimes loss) of resources each turn via a die roll. The game relies on the old and tired use of resources to construct buildings, but the way of acquiring those resources with your workers feels a bit novel. The rules are pretty simple, as they should for a family game, but there is a lot to consider if you want to play well. It looks beautiful and I had to resist the urge to buy it for the box art alone. The production is good and I only dislike the use of different types of components (cardboard and wooden pieces) to represent buildings.

Bought it in Essen 2016, we played it with the family a couple of times. However, it comes across quite mechanic, there is not a lot of interaction between the players, there's not a lot of strategy either. I will schedule it for some replays in the next weeks, but I am a little bit underwhelmed. Nonetheless, the material and artwork is gorgeous.

Good little game that plays very fast, looks gorgeous and could even function as a gateway.

You're settling a new, abundant land mass. Together you'll build huts, chaining into larger settlements. If these settlements get big enough a temple become a worthwile addition, ensuring the mental wellbeing of your people is taken care of. Lastly we have the druid, traveling all over the land, ensuring all is well. Of course, it is only honourable to provide this holy man with some small tribute so he can focus on guiding his people and does not have to worry about the daily banalities.

Druid pawn moves around, you pay resources and get points. Fail to pay and people will shun you, costing you points.

Another family game from Haba, though I'm sure younger players will get caught unawares by the demandy druid. Interesting resource collection (not a huge fan of the die) but the real meat is managing those resources, both knowing when to make an expensive purchase and when to hold them for offerings. Trades are rarely wise! Down for another play for sure.

New Haba game which doesn't really feel like a haba game. There is a lot of moving parts and more rules than a typical Haba game. Not easy to get into and very abstract. Will not be one I recommend for families just getting into gaming or anything like that. Kids will have a hard time grasping this one I think. A game I would play again, but not that interested in doing so. I definitely think Karuba is the better game in the Haba family.

really solid family style euro, but as a 2p, it gets insanely AP prone.  with more players (who can therefore do less and have less options), i think the crunch to target audience ratio would be better

This was quite thinky and more fun than i anticipated.  I am generally not a fan of abstract strategy games but the components, the art, the chunky pieces make up for the pasted on theme.  Can get quite mean at times, and played really well with 2 players.  This should be ranked much higher.  Recommended.

Meduris has a really attractive table presence thanks to its colorful board, chunky wooden bits, and three dimensional cardboard components. The resource gathering, building, and offering mechanisms are interesting and work well together. Nothing is complex about the rules, but the game lasts too long overall and I strongly dislike the end game whereby the player that triggers the last round doesn't get a final turn. This rule, combined with the lack of incentive that is sometimes associated with a similar end game condition in other games, frustrated me so much that I have no interest in playing Meduris again.

tl;dr: family friendly strategy game

Haba is working hard at carving out their spot in the market for family friendly games that don't just appeal to kids (like their main line of games). 2015's batch was pretty solid, and this year continues that trend.
This game again had a family friendly simple rule set but enough strategy to also appeal to players who are used to more strategic games. It reminds me of the games from the late 90's and early 2000's. In that time many games fit in this segment, these days most games seem either simpler or more complex.
This design is pretty solid, but it doesn't bring that much new or surprising. It's fine to play a couple of times and is perfect for the market it targets, but for people like me, it won't have much staying power.

Initial rating: 6.6/10
BGG scale: 6/10

Meduris is a fairly abstract game. there's a circle around the outside of the board. Every spot in the circle is a building spot with two symbols representing the construction resource types needed to build in that spot. There are four resource types: wood, sheep, stone, copper. Don't ask me what type of building you build with sheep!

Each resource has an area in the middle of the board. You have three meeples in those areas and you get resources from them. When you place a meeple in an area that's otherwise empty, you get a single resource of that type. If someone else is already in that resource area you place your meeple on top of them, you get two resources of that type, and they get one. If two people are there, you place on top of both of them and get three resources... the person in the middle gets two and the guy on the bottom gets one. Only three meeples can be in an area. All of this is assuming that there's enough resources to go around, if not it gets taken in top to bottom order.

On your turn you first roll a die. This will randomly either give everyone in one resource area that thing, make everyone pay a resource of their choosing, or take a resource of their choice. Then you either move a meeple and take resources, or build a hut. When you build, you pay the resource types shown on the spot. If that hut is by itself, you only pay one of each resource. If that hut is adjacent to other huts you pay extra resources for every hut in the chain. The fifth hut in a chain built on a wood/stone spot would pay 5 wood and 5 stone for example. When anything is built, you check the region it is in, and the rune for that region is given to the person who just built in that region.

Also, whenever you build the druid moves. He advances to the next hut. The owner of that hut can "make an offering" by paying either 1 resource of the type used to build the hut and get a point, both resources which scores a point for every hut in that chain of huts, or no resources and lose a point.

You can also build temples. Temples only cost 1 of each resource type for the spot no matter how many huts they are next to. The druid doesn't stop at them or count them for offerings, but they get you a point for every hut in the chains they touch at game end.

When the Druid completes a full lap of the board and crosses the river, you do a rune scoring and everyone gets 1 point for every rune they control.

The game end is triggered when someone builds all 8 of their huts and both of their temples. Every other player gets another turn. Then the druid does a final lap of the entire board and players can make offerings to him to score their huts a final time. At the end of the game you get triangular scoring for every rune you control.

The game is fairly quick, only about an hour, and was fun. It wasn't anything revolutionary, but I enjoyed it. The rulebook was horrible though. There were three page foldouts (for a game that shouldn't need a 3 page rulebook!) and it felt it was necessary to define the terms "obtain" and "use".

Don't be fooled.  This is not really what I'd consider a family game.  I think those rating it lower were expecting just that instead of something that requires careful end game planning.  Nice components as well.

Gateway worker placement gathering wool, stone, wood, and gold with stackable workers in Catan-lite fashion to build huts and temples around the base of Meduris Mountain a tribute to the Celtic gods.  The focus of the game is planning and timing of building huts and accumulating the right offerings to present to the visiting Druid as he travels his circle path.

UPDATE: Played shadows. Every bit as awesome as 3rd edition in the pink box.

I have only played the base version in 3rd edition, so I will adjust my score once I play Shadows, but my impression is that Puzzle Strike is the deck builder for me.  It has everything I love.  The characters are unique and based on a chibi Anime art style (which I love).  The catch up mechanic of being able to draw more as you get closer to death keeps the game on edge right up to the end.  It's quick to setup and play.  A play doesn't take very long and it's intense from start to finish.  And the replay-ability is insane.

I don't usually like to rate games as a "1" as most games truly don't deserve them, but I feel that I need to draw attention to the fact that David Sirlin, the designer of this game has behaved in ways that I find unacceptable and I think folks really should educate themselves before throwing money his way.

Mr. Sirlin's book, "Playing to Win" paints an extremely bleak portrait of what's going on in this guys head. What Sirlin's take on things essentially boils down to is that playing board and video games (read TOYS) should be a means of proving ones superiority over your friends and loved ones.  If you hold any other opinion, he's more than ready to tell you you're wrong.  He's told anyone who plays CCGs to leave his forums, nevermind if you're a fan of his work or a paying customer.  And then there's the whole part where he PLAGIARIZED someone else's work for the chip design in Puzzle Strike.

The following link, while humorous in nature, runs through the first chapter of Sirlin's book.  Jokes aside, take a look and ask yourself if you really want to encourage Sirlin any further.

I'm not telling anyone to not buy his games, but given that he is pretty much a one man operation, please keep in mind that you're truly voting with your dollars in this case.

His games entirely derivative anyway.

I've played Puzzle Strike casually for a few years now, and I still find new tactics to try out. It adds a strongly interactive experience to the deckbuilding mechanic through the gem system, and as such, it's impossible to feel like you're playing a solo game.

The components are GREAT. Instead of shuffling the same small deck over and over again, you get to shake a bag of chips. It's very satisfying.

The characters are vastly improved from the original version, both flavor-wise and balance-wise. Although there are a few very strong characters, they can be beaten. Similarly, all of the puzzle chips (community cards in any deckbuilder) are strong enough to be usable given the right situation.

Dominion style game with cardboard chips instead of cards. There are some big differences from Dominion. I for one like the three special powers chips each player gets for example. The way you try to eliminate other players by moving gems around is also cool. Still not sure I'd chose this over Dominion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Every bit as good as the base Puzzle Strike: 3rd Edition game.  Essentially a stand-alone set of 10 new characters and matching set of new bank chips.  Perfectly fine on its own, or mix it all together with the base set for a huge number of potential banks and character matchups.  The expansion characters are slightly more complex in their abilities, but it's every bit as tightly balanced and strategically deep as the base set, if not more so.

RATING: 8
Players are video game character battling each other in a last man standing battle. On your turn you add a gem to your pile, then play out your mini hand of five cards. At the end of your turn discard your hand and draw a new hand of five cards. The game is very heavily based on Dominion (acknowledged) but with three distinct differences. First, each player begins with three specific character cards in their deck, so everyone is different.  Second, there are no cards but instead played with poker chips with the information printed on them. Lastly, you are not collecting victory points, but instead trying to beat up your opponent by adding gems to their pile. You are knocked out of the game if you end a turn with 10 gems. Plays very clean and fast, and the poker chips make the shuffling much easier. 

A companion set to the 3rd edition with an entirely new chip set, and 10 new characters.

What's good about it? Real choices in how you play the chips that you've drawn. I didn't really find a lot of angst in how to play your hand in Dominion (base) or Thunderstone (base). I really love the fact that each player starts with 3 unique chips for the 'character' he/she is playing. This can really define how you want to play the game and what chips you want to purchase. It also feels more interactive than the two previously mentioned titles as you will be piling gems on your opponent. When they hit 10 or more at the end of their turn, they lose. With the whole gem pile mechanism, there are no dead chips (like dominion VP cards, some monsters in TS) in your 'deck' unless your opponent puts wounds in your deck with chips. There is also a sense of escalation since the more chips that are in your opponents pile, the more chips they draw, giving them greater opportunity to counter.

What are the points of caution? (1) Most people consider this optimally a 2 player game. That may be a benefit or hindrance to some. Though the multiplayer has changed in this edition... I haven't played multiplayer, so I can't comment (2) Based on the gem pile mechanism there is usually a high importance of purchasing/acquiring purple chips which interact with the gem piles. (3) Most other deck builders seem to be quicker at increasing their card variety with expansions. (4) My typical deck building issues and the chip thing. (5) This game has undergone many editions... first wood chips, then 2nd edition edition, then an upgrade pack, and then a new edition. This has been quite expensive for people that really like the game.

It's the gem pile management that kill my interest in the game. You have to manage your gem pile to be able to win. Crash Gems/Combines are the most straight-forward way to do this. So, the puzzle chips usually seem like unnecessary distractions unless they grant additional arrows. This is an over simplification and perhaps with an extreme devotion to the game to learn it's subtlety the players would use a variety of chip types, but I'm not willing to devote that much time to this game.

The iOS or Steam implementation is a cheap way of finding out whether this is a game you have interest in.

A great deckbuilder that uses chips instead of cards. While dominion has interaction through attack cards, you have to go out of your way to inconvenience your opponents. Puzzle Strike, on the other hand, is a direct battle. If you aren't attacking your opponent then you are losing, and the only way to win is to continue hitting your opponent. It's a very slick setup that flows really well and plays quickly.

A great twist on deck building, one of my favourites. The risk/reward that comes from having many gems is both a good comeback mechanic and an interesting strategy. I like that it's confrontational by design, that makes it the "deck" builder with the most player interaction that I've played.

While deck-building is not my favorite mechanic, this is my favorite iteration of it -- the Player vs. Player agression makes the game more than an engine builder (or at least, if you engine build, it is at your own risk; and it becomes your opponent's responsibility to shut it down or build faster). The decisions are meaningful while still being a fast and furious game of taking swings at your opponent.

Fixes most things I don't like(minimal interaction/irrelevant theme/snowball effect/pseudo-cooperative nature) about deck-building games except the inherent randomness of drawing from a bag of chips or a deck of cards.

Most deck builders are too beholden to strategic probability, which I'm not interested in exploring 99% of the time

More interactive than Dominion, and has more variety from game to game with a smaller pool of chips(cards) due to the asymmetrical characters.

These notes are about the *two player* game. Some find Dominion better with 3+ players.

If it were more easily available in stores (instead of being mostly available through Sirlin's website), more buzz would be created. People would inquire about it, store owners would talk about it… It is hardly seen anywhere in France, Third Edition cannot be found in China even on Taobao (and only one store has Shadows),… Too bad that this game does not have more exposure.

I prefer it to Thunderstone, but I am not sure why: Thunderstone has way better art, much more obvious theme (weapons, light, fighters, ranged attacks,…). Maybe it is because Shadows is more direct (it does not hide simple basic mechanism (more attack, more money) under theme), maybe it's because I was not bothered by a long string of monsters that must be slaughtered one by one (not so much sense of progression, contrary to the gem pile going higher and higher), maybe because the game takes less space, feels easier to bring to the table?

A very strong Dominion feel. After only 2 games, with only the basic setup, I could not recommend it to someone who has Dominion: they feel very similar to me (small, relatively theme-less effects). However, after 2 plays, I under-appreciated how much can be done with the characters (I underused Zane): after 5 plays, I really feel the "presence" of the characters in each deck, up to the end (despite the only 3 character chips). Furthermore, counting points during the game is an extra challenge, in Dominion: do I stop the game now (by emptying the right stack) because I am winning, or should I keep going? a challenge like this detracts me from the deck-building challenge proper, so I prefer Puzzle Strike, on this.

The effects are more varied than in Dominion's Base Game + Intrigue.

The strategy is also richer and more subtle. For example: Dominion's +Action is present in Shadows, but also generalized as +Action *of a certain color* (Red for Attack, Blue for Defense, etc.). This makes people ponder consider more strategic options (e.g.: my character is good for attacks, my opponent is not good with attacks: I will gain an advantage with the +Attack [Red] Action chips).

That said, I appreciate seeing the number of remaining bank tokens at a glance, and knowing that they have all been put back correctly, after playing. There is a physical satisfaction to manipulating these "chips with power". I also appreciate the fact that the game is as streamlined as Dominion (not many rules, not many exceptions), and more streamlined than Thunderstone (with its restrictions on how many times a weapon can be equipped, on which cards can be discarded as a payment for an ability, on how to handle the Bearer at the end,…). I also like the fact that there are fewer things that "get in the way" of the deck-building feature of the game than in Thunderstone (with the light, power, stones, etc. "currencies", which I find actually detract from the main difficulty of the game, which is deck-building).

I also like the physical stacks of chips: I can see at a glance how many chips remain, and if they all have been put back at the end of the game. The chips are physical, concrete, and have some real, physical power: they can send gems, they can by other chips: the feeling is better than with cards, which are more common, less physical.

The rulebook is very well done. It even includes practical considerations like "The three purple chips are the heart of the game." instead of merely listing mechanical rules. There are a couple small omissions, though: (1) crashed gems go in some intermediate area when they are "sent to an opponent's gem pile" (this is not obvious from the wording, and is only quite clear from the example on p. 5); (2) Double Crash Gems can be used to counter-crash, despite the rules reading "you can also use a Crash Gem to “counter-crash”" [Crash Gem is the name of a chip that can counter-crash, hence the confusion]; (3) "You can play a Combine even if it doesn’t combine anything in order to get the +black arrow." is ambiguous: "doesn't" because it can't, or because you don't want to? (on the other hand, there is the "Do Everything You Can" rule that indicates that you must Combine, I think). (4) The Free-for-All gem crashing and counter-crashing does not specify who receives which gems (http://boardgamegeek.com/article/11625739#11625739). (5) In Free-for-All, the "no gem sent if above 10 gems" rule is not explicit in the case of 2+ released crashes: can the attacker send back gems during counter-counter crash his second release crash, when the first crash put him back at 10+ gems? (a strict reading of the rules says "no", I just hope that this is the case: that the rules can be applied strictly). ANYWAY: it could be much better if some terms were defined precisely: crash (= break into pieces, before sending to a *single* opponent), send (= put in a special sending area, usually after a crash; emptied to a single player gem pile if the send is not countered), ante (= put directly in gem pile). (6) Multiple players can react with a Blue shield to *themselves* being attacked, but only *one* player can with a purple shield (= Crash React), with a specific priority order: the rules only mention this rule for "counter-crashing" (on p. 10), not more generally for Crash React.

So, the problem is mostly small but important rule points, or rule points that need to be inferred. In summary, the rulebook is clear, has even an added layer of basic strategy and comments about a typical game, but it has a few holes. Fortunately, the holes are patched in BGG's Rules forum, and the final, full rules are quite streamlined.

While playing, I tend to forget two things: Anteing (even after 6 games), and taking more chips when my gem pile is high (this was solved after maybe 3 games: since it's a bonus, it is less likely to be forgotten). For Anteing, we have decided to say "Ante" when we do it, so that the other players expect to hear something and can remember more easily hearing something (which is useful since they might not have been paying attention at the beginning of their opponent's turn).

The comeback mechanism feels good: when the gem pile becomes too big, you get to draw more chips. Nothing like getting help from someone who understands in what a dire position you are. This is a positive mechanics: it helps you instead of hindering the leaders (Dominion…).

I don't like hindering my opponent with Wounds or discards… I guess I'm afraid that being less powerful will make him enjoy the game less…

I wonder if the "Combine-Combine-Crash: Counter-Crash?" common sequence of play will not get a little boring after a while… In other words, this necessary combination dilutes the usefulness of Puzzle chips, and can make the game less interesting (this is not a problem with Dominion). In practice, though, I really play with the character chips, the buying power, and the puzzle chips (a little less, for the latter, after 5 games, as I have a hard time implementing the strategy I have chosen).

The theme is clearly stronger than in Dominion (Just a Scratch (can partially heal an Ouch!, when it turns out it was… just a scratch!), Repeated Jabs (repeated attacks, indeed), Safe Keeping, Rocket Punch (very fast counter attack),…). I like this very much: the game has an additional layer of polish.

7 games: Loving this game more and more: short, with pleasure taken from establishing strategies and counter-strategies, based on the characters and the opponent's draws. I never took my opponent much into account in Dominion, other than for counting their VPs. In Puzzle Strike, I must check their blocking power (Blue Shields), how aggressive they can be (Red Fists), how their plans can be disrupted (via trashing, discarding, etc.).

The effects are richer than in Dominion. How does the game achieve this? An example: some chips allow you to ante a gem in your own pile (Giant Growth…); this is superficially counter-intuitive, as one wants a small gem pile; instead, this allows one to use a different strategy: put a gem in the pile in order to send it quickly. So, part of the recipe for the variety is to have some "counter-intuitive"/unusual effects that can actually be put to good use. Innovation has similar effects (Bicycle, which allows one to exchange one's hand with one's Influence, at an Age where normally the Influence is large and the hand might be small): effects that can be very powerful in the right circumstance. Where Innovation is tactical, Puzzle Strike is strategic: a strategy can be constructed around chips that have very different effects (e.g., ante a gem in your gem pile vs discard a gem from your gem pile).

12 games: played my first 3-player game. Very nice. Same feeling as with 2 players, but with the added dimension of more social interaction (negotiations to not be attacked, etc.), some added playing time, and a slightly more interesting situations, thanks to the 2 opposing characters and the interactions between the 3 characters (and the discussions about each other's strengths).

160 games: the only thing I don't like so much is that the iOS version is much more convenient because it goes faster. I still don't master the characters so well: there is a richness to be found in this. The strategy guides found on the web help me explore strategies I would not have thought of. 

Positive points (mostly shared by Dominion):
+ Short (30-45' with 2 players)
+ Turns are quick. The symbols on the chips are a little easier to parse than the text in dominion (+ Arrow instead of + 1 Action (?).) Is often better to only buy one chip.

All plays and thoughts under PS 3rd Ed

*June 2013* After about 5 or 6 plays with Shadows, I think I prefer just the third edition. Shadows feels very attacky and this game, by design, is already about attacking the others. Playing with both versions is fun but I may like the purity of the base one a bit more. Still, Shadows isn't going anywhere and I plan on playing with both for a very long time

Despite adding some much-needed variety to Puzzle Strike matchups, the new chips (character as well as puzzle) in this game are mostly very defensive and combo-oriented, making matches last significantly longer and occasionally become near-stalemates due to the overall reduction in outright offensive abilities.

This standalone expansion is dynamite when combined with the chips from the base game. It's really just "more Puzzle Strike", but it pushes Puzzle Strike over a certain threshold, and makes it hit the right balance I think between variety and focused depth

The characters and puzzle chips are more imaginative than what you have in the Vanilla game, and explore some new territory. And yes, there is some complexity creep, so despite being a "standalone" this functions better as an expansion for those who already have the base game, because I feel like without the base set you'll be missing some "core" chips that aren't as exciting, but provide a stable base.

Of note here is that there are even more chips in this expansion that FORCE you to react to them (by adjusting your strategy) as soon as your opponent buys them, meaning real player interaction and engagement (a rarity in deck-building games). This goes for puzzle chips and especially the expansion characters. Once you identify key strategies, and how to react to them instead of just "doing your own thing", your win rate will increase dramatically.

(5 Design + 5 Enjoyment)

Tons of fun.  One of the few games where people I've taught it to immediately wanted to play again.

A necessary expansion, not because the base game lacks anything, but the new puzzle chips add so much to the game's variety and depth, it's hard to imagine a set without them. The new characters are all unique, worthwhile additions on a par with the originals. Shadows perfects Puzzle Strike, already the best deck-builder for two players.

I had never played the previous iteration of Puzzle Strike but I quite enjoyed this game.  I love that it is essentially a deck-building game with chosen characters that each have their own (from what I saw, pretty balanced) special powers.  The strategic and combo potential is high and there are several different play styles.  I especially like the mechanic of balancing your gem pile, larger gem piles draw you more cards (sorry, chips) every turn but once it gets too high you lose the game.

The component quality was good for the most part.  The chips are thick and solid but the printing/cutting on them was pretty poor.  Almost none of the chips had the art centered on the front and back (though there wasn't any hard to read or cut off print which is good, compared to something like Mage Knight).  Also I would have liked to have seen labels of some sort in the chip tray to make organizing and finding chips easier.

I don't know if there's a market for it besides me but I would also love to see a pricier version with actual clay chips.  I love the feel of holding real chips and this would be the perfect game for that treatment.

I pretty much treated this as a large expansion. Not bad.

This is the perfect deckbuilding game. It combines this already fun genre with direct player interaction, asymmetrical starting conditions and lots of tactical depths. Despite the name (which was chosen because of the theme), it is not a "puzzle", but a battle of wits from the very first turn until the very last one.

It works great as a competitive 2-player game, but it is also lots of fun for 3 and 4 players. The free-for-all multiplayer mode is very dynamic while avoiding all the usual problems that can plague multiplayer games with direct attacks.

The standalone expansion for Puzzle Strike Third Edition is just as good as the base set and you can mix and match them to great effect. You should just own both.

I have the PnP version, but have yet to print it out and add it to the base game.

Phenomenal add-on to the base game, that can also be played by itself. But meshed together, it really creates one brilliant masterpiece. For first time buyers, as many would suggest, buy PS Third Edition before purchasing this one. The slightly more complex chips and characters make this not as ideal to start with.

If you enjoy the base game and want even more variety, it's worth picking this up. If you don't own the base game, this works just as well as a starter box.

Note this is both 3rd edition and Shadows combined into 1 box for 4 players...all extra chips, bags etc have been removed. All common chips are in poker chip trays for easy access and storage during game play.

Great game, even as a stand alone from Puzzle Strike, but I prefer the base game's characters.

Shadows characters and puzzle chips are, in general, a little more complex than those in the Third Edition base set, but just as fun. Like in its predecessor, each character is well represented by their 3 specific chips, and the possibilities for banks (and thus potential combos from your hand) are practically endless.

I like the character chips in this set far and away above the ones in the regular set. While they are both beautifully balanced in ways I am still learning about, I find the flavour of these characters more fun. Not surprisingly, it has a darker theme. Considering this set is a complete game without the regular Puzzle Strike, I recommend buying Puzzle Strike Shadows before regular Puzzle Strike.

Another well-designed Yahtzee variant. The rules regarding tie is different from the standard board game. After one play, I don't like the change. Maybe it is something I'll just have to get used to.

This rating is for the base game (we haven't tried the Alcazaba variant yet). While very good-looking, with nice components, this dice game can be very frustrating as there are no way to mitigate bad rolls. Whereas Alhambra the boardgame allows you to strategize and control your moves, here, you are at the mercy of the dice. The bonus tiles offer some nice options, but those are few and far between. My girlfriend and I both wanted to like this game more, but became bored with it about halfway through our first game (we finished it, but with a definite lack of enthusiasm)...

A melding of Yahtzee with the scoring element from Alhambra that lasts much too long and has significant downtime with five or six players.  Some interesting possibilities, but overall there is too little control of your destiny.

We had been staring at this one of the shelf of our friendly neighborhood gaming store for months but were indecisive because there was nothing really about it anywhere review or gameplay wise. So we finally just said to heck with it and bought it. It took us a while to figure out what to do. The rules are , oddly enough, not written very well which is extremely strange given how easy to follow the rules are for Alhambra and Granada (also by Dirk Henn). So we had to slog through the first game trying to decipher what everything meant. The scoring was weird and , again, not explained very well. We were also perplexed by one thing in the game but found out that wasn't a design mistake. Each round we rolled the dice to see which building we would try and go for but kept getting confused about the allocation until we suddenly realized that our copy had come with 9 white building dice instead of the standard 8. We finally managed to get it sorted out and enjoy the game. It would actually rate close to Alhambra but that rule book just drags it into 7. And if you have Alhambra (and why wouldn't you) it doesn't make a lot of sense to get this one as well.

really a quite decent game with more splashes of yahtzee and can't stop than alhambra.  i've played with 4P and 3P, and i think 3P was better because of pacing.  game length is really my only potential knock against it, although i think the game is somewhat sterile compared to things like airships and such which feature dice rolling and powers.  kingsburg might fit the bill too, although i haven't yet played that one.  not deserving of more than 45 minutes imo.

I am not a great fan of dice games but this game plays well.  It is a much better game for the Alhambra themeing, which could otherwise have just been bland one to six numbers.  The downgrading of your results arising from the second and third throws is a nice mechanic.  Like most of the Alhambra range this game I consider that the game plays best with three, avoiding down time, as there is no scope for forward planning.  Rating improved with second play with family group.

I've only played the dice game. It can be slow and repetitive and it lasts longer than it should, but not too long to make it unplayable.  Over time I expect my rating to drop.

Really like Alhambra but this dice version falls short for me or too long rather!  As much as I want to like this game it gets long and a bit monotomous fast.  Prefer the combo varient but even with that I still prefer to play the original Alhambra.  
***Update: I've upped my rating of this game from a 5 to a  7 because my enjoyment and appreciation of the combo variant has gone up over repeated plays.  See this as worth buying for this variant alone.

I really like how it plays. The fun I have turn-to-turn would make it a 7.

It is so, unbelievably, ridiculously long though. We finish one round, feel pretty good about it, then realise we have to do [i]four more[/i] of these and that seems really, really excessive, because you're just doing the same things each round.

This game would rock if it was, say, three rounds. It's been a while since I played but from memory it seemed the scoring didn't make it easy to tweak that. Hrm.

[In Alhambra box, since it can also be played as an Alhambra variant.]

The rules are a tough slog and it took three times to get right. I think the game works best with three or four players--I would never play with six and only with five under duress.

The game has the same majority collection goal of the tile game, this time just in a different realm.

My opinion of this drops each time I play it, mainly because it is too long for a game that is decided mostly by chance.  There are a few tactical decisions to make, but in the end the dice rule and if you do not roll what you need you will lose.  Yspahan is a similar, but better, game.

The base game/dice game combo (as opposed to the stand-alone dice game) actually isn't too bad, actually kind of clever. You've got different stuff to roll for, different risks, although you are at the mercy of the dice to perhaps a larger degree than would be ideal, given the length ... which, really, is the problem. The game is just too long for what you get out of it. I've been playing the Siedler dice game a bit recently, and the two are very similar in terms of the buttons they push for me, but Siedler I can do in 10-15 minutes, Alhambra can push or exceed 2 hours with 6 players. Same problem the basic game has, which I guess should be unsurprising.

Like Alhambra, the game gets seriously bogged down the more players you add. It says 6 on the box, but the practical limit is probably 4. Since the downtime is directly proportional to the number of players, the more you've got, the worse things get.

RATING: 4
While the game play is kinda-sorta fun at first, it takes way too long and wears out its welcome. Also, there really aren't many meaningful choices. Early in the game, you just roll for whatever you got a lot of on your first roll. After a few rounds, you just focus on whatever building types you've already made progress in. It seemed like most of my choices were made for me, which made it kinda boring. There are just too many other good dice rolling games out there to bother. Queen was just trying to capitalize on the Alhambra name with this one.

RATING: 7
A nice game based around the alhambra scoring system but with quite a bit of strategy mixed in for good measure - In the end though it's the one who rolls the best who comes out on top. I wouldn't play it with too any players as I think it would slow  the game way down. 1 Play.

Only played as two player game so far but have played as the standard game and with the tile building option. We have really enjoyed both versions but prefer the extra interest and challenge of actually building your own Alhambra and scoring for the wall. My rating is for that version.
I don't think I would want to play this with more than 4 players as the control would diminish and the down time would increase too much I believe.

Seemed like a pretty good dice game with the fault of being too long, so would like to try with fewer turns. Some of the scoring mechanics (and special powers) reminded me of Knizia scoring, but maybe that's euro-normal in a good way. Nomenclature--octagonal pieces = "yahtzee pegs".

Based on 1 play with 2 players.  Ok, but takes much too long for what you get out of it.  There are several other dice games out there that are both faster and better.  Would like to try the combined game with the base Alhambra tiles sometime.

RATING: 3
An exercise in frustration and helplessness.  Along with feeling tied to the dice rolls, it often seems like your options are limited to one course of action, and if you can't manage those particular rolls, you're doomed to failure, as well as being forced to accept extremely disappointing results.  Also, your "accomplishments" in the game often feel miniscule and unsatisfying, and far too easy for others to overcome, especially when you're competing with several players.

Also, when you're playing with a lot of people, be prepared to be bored for a while.

RATING: 2
What a terrible waste of resources. Multiple weird tables with numbers outlining the number of attempts plus a few modifiers are supposed to hide the fact that the game is in fact Yathzee played on several scoring sheets at the same time. It might be slightly okayish with just two or three players where the pigeon hold principle ensures that you win something even if you roll badly, thus strengthening the role of the bonus multipliers. But if that principle ensures this, then why bother playing? At the high end of the player number scale, the game is truly an uncontrollable luck fest without a shred of interesting play. Really, veto this if someone wants to put it on the table.

Either way, there are quicker and more intelligent Yathzee-lookalikes available on the market if you have few players; and better and smarter games if you have a lot. Avoid this stinker, which is just a means of Dirk Henn cashing in on the Alhambra fame.

Components: Great board, great dice. Very easy and pleasing to see the information.

Experience: It's like a thematic Yahtzee. Rolling/collecting dice is always fun, but here it takes on the competitive aspect where I really really want some colors, and can afford to let others slide. The tile powers adds some spice.

One of my favorite dice games, behind Dice Town and Roll through the Ages.

Bought at ToonCon 2015 for $16.  It's pretty simple, with the same theme as the tile game.  I don't own the original game in order to play the alternate rules.
This game takes a long time to play, at least an hour.  It's not how you roll the first round that is important, it's how you roll on the last rounds that determines the winner.

This is a completely different game than Alhambra. I would call it 'Yahtzee for thinkers'.

I don't particularly like the monotony of pure dice rolling, but this game forces an extra level of decision-making that (I feel) allows for some interesting strategy - while still remaining a light game overall. I thought our 5- and 6-player games had a bit too much downtime between turns, but the 3-player one was a good balance.

I like this version much better than regular Alhambra.  It might sound counter-intuitive, but I think the dice version is actually less random, and allows for more player choice.  In the regular game, you are limited in your choices to what tiles are flipped up, and you can't really strategize because you never know which tile your opponent will purchase.  However, in the dice game, you always have a choice as to what you are going to roll for.
This is rapidly becoming a favorite in my house, my game group, and my church.

Players roll eight dice, trying to make the highest "of a kind" set they can in up to three rolls.  This sets them on a ladder of results for the different die results, which enable advances on a results ladder, which awards victory points at different stages of the game.  Still with me?  Quite a simple push your luck game that does give you some stuff to consider.  Rather bolted onto what is become the Alhambra juggernaught, but a good game.  Feels a bit long though - not sure simple dice rolling games can stand up to a hour's playing time.

Darquil and I recently played a game using the Alhambra components.  I won't pretend we actually played Alhambra because we were so off on the rules it might as well have been a completely different game (we placed the dummy on all colors, randomly rolling the color--so the dummy sometimes had multiple pieces on a single color--and we scored each round after playing one set of five turns).

Even with those caveats, I feel like I saw enough to know that I don't love the game.  In a dice rolling game, I prefer to have more options for splitting the dice (instead of a pure "get the most of a color" rolling).

After a few plays, the dice rolling and waiting for your turn gets tiresome. You have few choices, but they can be teasing. Yet your basic decisions are controlled by the first roll each turn, so there is way too much luck for my taste. I've not played the other side with the tile variant. Try Ysphahan, which is also a dice roller, but more fun, and has more choices to be made.

The box has two games: the Basic Dice Game (a stand alone game) and then an expansion to Alhambra the Board Game (which uses all the tiles and Reserve Boards).

I was pleasantly surprised with the "Basic Dice Game". I got this game to play with my daughter who strongly likes  games of luck--and this is a dice game.  So I am always looking for dice games I can stand.  In this Basic Dice Game the bonus tiles add a lot of strategy to this game--which really pleases me, but alas, too much for my daughter.  Although it does have similarities to Alhambra, the Basic Dice Game is a very different game.  At the time I purchased it, I did so reluctantly because I thought they would be too similar.  I am glad I have both.

However, I do not like the variant play which uses the backside of the board, because it is too similar to Alhambra.  It is actually an expansion to Alhambra the Board Game and uses all the tiles and scoring boards.  I like the board game over this dice variant--I just think it is a better game.

Because the variant/expansion can't be played without the base game, and because both boxes take up a lot of room, I wish I could combine the Dice Game in the same box with Alhambra and all its expansions.  But it just doesn't all fit in one box, but almost.  (Wish I had known Alhambra the Big Box was going to be marketed.)

There are some dice based games that have some charme and simply make fun. Alhambra the dice game is just not one of them. Although the rules are fairly easy to learn or teach and there was some tremendous effort put in this game to make it at least a bit tactical the gameplay is boring.

Maybe you'll like, maybe not but there are better dice based games in this world: Yspahan, Airships, To Court the King, Shanghaien to name only a few. My advice - avoid.

RATING: 5
Its a family game so rated on  that basis.  Not as good as the original Alhambra or its own earlier incarnations, but still worth a play or 2.  Bit long  and repetitive would be my concerns - it took 1 hr 10 mins for 3 - you get 5 turns/round for 5 rounds, thats 25 turns each; and usually 3 rolls per turn, so there are 75 die rolls - each.  The 2nd game (building the Alhambra) is interesting, but funnily enough adding the buildings and walls made the die-rolling more important and accentuated the luck-dependent nature.  At 14E cost at Essen was a reasonable purchase.  People need to take their turns quickly - really the decisions are relatively small per turn.  But have found even too long for the kids. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Just like the original Alhambra game, you don't want to play this with 6 players.  The game will drag and you definitely want to try this with people that play at a decent pace.  I get the impression people don't like this because they don't like dice games, or they tried it with the full number of players.  I think 4 is a good maximum number of players.  For what it is, I enjoyed this game and the components are great.  The board is double-sided and there is another set of rules for a dice game using the tiles from the original Alhambra game.  Value!

Update: Having played this again, I can say that 2-3 players is a great number.  The game still isn't short, but it's fun, and you have decisions to make and risks to take.  The added 'ghost' player in the 2 player game works great.  My only thought is that people are bagging on it because they played with 6 and wanted it over sooner.  You could easily decide to play this game until the 2nd scoring rather than the third if need be.

Not tons of depth, but I enjoy the player interaction. The fact that it accommodates up to 6 is a huge plus for me as well with my current group. It's dice, so there's plenty of luck, but at least there are plenty of options (various colors for one to focus on winning). That doesn't guarantee success, but helps me at least "feel" competitive, even if I'm clearly losing.

I finally got to play this game.  I had a lot of fun playing it.  I am a strategic person and like to talk about options as the game goes on so it was fun with the group of people playing.  We were all looking at the best moves to be made through the game for everyone.  That aside, I think the game is a good twist for a dice game.  It has a luck factor that does play into, but there are always options that make this game a strategic enough game to be enjoyable with bad dice rolling.  I might rate it higher after a few more games.

High randomness with few real choices to make would be bad enough but this one lasts around 90 minutes where it ought to be a half hour or less. That's just far too long for the enjoyment to be had here. It's a shame because I sort of liked the struggle on the various point tracks, but that just isn't enough when shorter and far superior dice games exist.

(1 play, 6 players)

Like Yahtzee but less fun.  They took a simple dice game and nailed some euro mechanics into its skull to increase the playtime to an almost unbearable level.  However, I would be interested in trying the version that mixes it with Alhambra the board game.

I haven't played it, but I've watched almost the whole game.  Extremely _long_ and boring design.  Very mechanical and monotonous too - you roll dice ALL THE TIME.
Only towards the end some competition, calculation and emotions showed up.  Hence '4', not '2'.

Only played with two players so far. Like the original Alhambra, you simulate a third player (Dirk) when playing with two. It wasn't a bad game, but I think it would play better with more "real" players. I think it's a little long for just two players, but I'd be willing to try it again with more.

Alhambra meets Yatzee!  Well not really as you are always just rolling to get the largest set of one of 6 symbols.  Lots of luck as you would expect, some but not much strategy.

Very neat game.  Feels very much like Alhambra and rates very well in the recent crop of Dice games.  I think I like it a little better oberall than Airships, but not as much as To Court the King.  4-6 player, though, this is MUCH superior to To Court the King.

A little long, but VERY competitive. 

Revised:  Way, way WAAAY too long for what it is, especially with AP players.  Great game for 30-40, LOUSY for 90.

RATING: 6.5
Had I picked this up at full price, I might have been really disappointed. As it was, I got it for a little over $10 thanks to a sale; and at that price it really was a steal.  

Yes, it's really simple with a miniscule amount of strategy involved - but my mom loves to play it (having been raised on Yahtzee). And when it comes down to it, a game that brings the family together to have a laugh, it does a great job at that. It provides enough interaction to get moderately competitive, and the scoring usually keeps everyone fairly close until the end - making sure that everyone stays interested and having fun until the end.

And beyond that, my mother and my wife absolutely loved it - which alone was worth the price. However, we got this before we played the original Alhambra. Whether it was a case that the dice game set-up the board game or not; after playing and falling in love with the original, the dice game only hits the table on rare occasions.

Not a bad design, but this is a nothingburger. Too much die-rolling without much decision making. Often your first roll of the dice leads you down a certain path. Plays a bit too long for what it is, particularly with a higher number of players and resulting increase in downtime.

RATING: 4
We stopped playing before scoring the first round, if that tells you anything. And I like Alhambra. Of course, we were playing with five, which seems like a really bad idea. Very, very random; lots of down time with more players. Whereas the original game balances out the higher values of certain building colors by the cost, the fact that the dice game uses six-sided dice, each with one of the six building colors, means that getting purple instead of blue is a matter of luck.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Not bad as far as dice games go.  There is a more complex scoring system in place that force you to make some interesting decisions regarding which building you need to push yourself to score.  The main problem I have with the game is that it really bogs down, even with 3 players.  I would never even think of playing it with 4, 5 or 6.  I kind of feel that way about the base Alhambra game, but probably even moreso here, just because the weight of the game (ultra lightweight, since your fate is still determined by the rolls you get) doesn't fit so well with a long play time.

We played 5 players and while the game is somewhat interesting, it dragged on for way too long.  I think it took over 2 hours to play.  I think it would be a fine game it it took 30-45 minutes to play.  I'm not sure playing with less people would shorten the game significantly since you get more markers.

I love dice games as long as there is enough strategy to cover the randomness of the dice rolling.  This game doesn't have any.  Best dice roll wins.  It is completely random.  But, on the upside it did take 90 minutes to play.  Ridiculous, I'll never play again.  Save your money, don't buy this game!

I like the way the original game components have been turned into a dicegame. I like dice so not too much can go wrong here. This game has 2 different ways to play it. One is a reasonably simple roll-the-dice game with a bit of strategy in choosing which dice to choose and how many risks to take. The second is compatible with the original Alhambra-game only now you roll dice for your buildings instead of paying for them.
I like both versions and will play whenever someone will play with me.

1. For the simple dice game. It is pretty simple to learn and to set up. Yes the game is pretty much luck based with less strategy than Alhambra, but for a filler it's alright. Similar to yahtzee I guess. 

2. As a variation to the original alhambra, I feel there is more depth to the game then the base dice game. You still build your palace like the original game but instead of money you use dice to get tiles. It's a decent variation of Alhambra.

Rating based against other "dice" games.  This one requires some thinking, blended well with luck and a good undercurrent of "take a gamble and roll the bones".  Not as simplistic as some reviewers would lead you to believe.  It is still a pretty simple dice game in terms of how it plays, but you do need to give thought as to what you do in your turn. I'd keep it to 2-3 players to speed it up and avoid long down times between turns.REVISED: Gets better with each playing, don't think this is bad because it is a dice based game.  On the lighter side but makes a nice game for breaking up a long day of gaming, and is really quite good as a 2 player game.  In fact, the 2 player version allows for some pretty close games and the mytical "Dirk" thrid player is sometmes hard to beat!

Played once with 4 players.  I feel it just went long for what it is.  There are a few interesting mechanisms in the game, and some risk taking, but it just took too darn long.  I feel it should go 3 rounds instead of 5, perhaps.  Luck plays a significant factor over decision making, which is fine in a shorter dice game.  I think the more time you invest in a gaming experience, the LESS luck should play a significant role.

I would never personally suggest this game, but would be willing to play it if all other players REALLY wanted to play it.

Hmmm..... glorified Yahtze with a few bells and whistles sans straights.  If one person at the table rolls four or five of a kind on their first roll and you are rolling singles there is no way you can hope to win...  If the game took only 20 or 30 minutes my rating would improve.  As it takes at least twice that long for a five or four player game it really overstays its welcome...  I think Queen should definitely keep milking the Alhambra line.  I can't wait for the next installment... yawn.

On the up side it does have some interesting choices.  If you win a column   you can take either one or two points on the color scoring chart.  In the early game I would think it would always be better to take the two points... but some of the special tiles come in pretty handy at times.

Still, this is a miss for me.  Diamant, Can't stop, Sharp Shooters and Liar's Dice remain the leaders for me when it comes to the bones.

Better than Yahtzee, not as good as Alhambra. It's beginning to grow on me this one.

Each round the players make a series of rolls to try and position their limited markers onto each of the 6 Alhambra Building Type...ladders. At the end of the round, the players acquiring 1st and 2nd place in each ladder earn the right to place/advance their scoring marker on the scoring ladder. Bonus tiles are also awarded and can be used for rolls taken later in the game.

The game is played over 5 rounds (with rounds 1, 3 and 5 being scoring rounds).

This is very Yahtzee-esque but it is fun and interesting. It can also be played in a 2nd format that uses the tiles from Alhambra, with the dice helping to secure tiles of choice as they are revealed.

I like this game a lot but it is definitely too long with 4-5 players. Best played with 3.

With 8 dice, roll as many symbols of the same type as you can, and you can re-roll twice. Put a marker on the number of symbols that you rolled. After each round, first place gets their choice of moving up 2 squares on the scoring chart for that building, or moving up one space and taking the special chit. Chits are worth VPs, or give special abilities, such as re-rolling dice, or adding a symbol of your choice. The scoring for the buildings is like for Alhambra (Score in 3 of the rounds, in the first round, only the first place player earns points, in the second round, first two players score points and in the last round, the top three score points. This game is light, but is long (about 2 hrs for five players).  There's nothing really new here, and other dice games are much more fun. Yes, we did have some good laughs, laughing at other people's rolls, and making jokes, but the rolling aspect loses its appeal quick. I haven't tried the other game where you play with the base Alhambra game.

I only played the hybrid/tile version so I can't comment on the strict dice version (though from what I hear, I'm not missing anything). As an alternate way to compete for Alhambra pieces, the dicing works pretty well. Unfortunately, I don't think it's better than the card drafting and likely wouldn't want to play it very often. $20 for a few dice and a board that I would hardly, if ever, use is not a good investment.

I like this dice game quite a bit, and so does my daughter.

Rules are simple and it feels like this takes less time than normal Alhambra. An interesting variant is included when using tiles from the base game. Downtime between turns is my biggest issue, so not recommended for more than 3 people.

Barely scrapes into my 7.5 grouping, and might drop with future play.

Wow, was I disappointed with this game.  I'm normally okay with dice games if they have some way to mitigate the randomness; in this game, the randomness is actually made worse.  This is because players who "do well" (that is, get lucky) early in the game are actually in a better position to score well later, as well.  Yes, this is a game of taking risks, but I dislike games in which a little bad luck early in the game dooms you for the rest of it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Another way of enjoying Alhambra. The dice game is fun and light, whereas Alhambra is more medium weight. The dice rolls you collect allow you to establish your position on the different colored building tracks. For example, if you collect several white buildings in one roll, you can position yourself higher than other players that had to roll 2 or 3 times in comparison. When the round is over, the highest player on each track will collect either a token or advance their playing disc. A tough choice because some of the tokens offer a re-roll possibility or adding a die or victory points.

To play the regular dice game Solitaire, I use the regular 2player rules and add a 2nd "Dirk" player. I set up Dirk2 rolling a die for each pawn placement. 

The flip side of the board offers the Alcaza (tile laying) dice game. It uses the tiles from regular Alhambra, the start fountain tile, and a rebuild board. The rules for this are not clear and there isn't much information here on the BGG to clarify. For a solitaire game, what I did was follow the 2-player rules adding in 2 "Dirk dummy players." I set up Dirk 1 with the normal rules and Dirk 2 I set up with random die roll (i.e. as done in the regular 2-player rules). There can be more than one Dirk pawn in each column and I believe you can play more than one of your own pawns in one column if you wish.

This game is a little too long to for a dice game, but it is very solid.  You have good choices with the dice, and the rounds develop well.  It REALLY pays to go last though, and winning the token that lets you assign first player is pretty powerful.  It's a great adaptation of original Alhambra game, and it has a variation that mixes the dice mechanisms with the tile-placement.  Haven't tried that yet, but it looks like a solid twist.  2Player mode is also excellent, using a dummy player as with the original game.

Much better than original Alhambra. I even enjoy the Alcazaba variant much better than the non-dice game.

1 play; 3 player. Played the combo dice and full game rather than just the dice game. Substituting the dice for the cards is more different than better. A mini round of Can't Stop instead of pseudo rummy. The competition for a set of tiles added much more to the palace building portion. Rather than discovering what tile you gained and finding a home for it, you now get a series of tiles and then puzzle out the palace. Adds another layer of strategy to the overall experience. After a ways into the game, it does begin to feel like Yahtzee though.

Completist that I am, I want this to finish up my Alhambra collection. My wife Kasey loves dice games and Alhambra has always been our family gateway game of choice, so I think this would be a nice addition. I suspect that we will be playing the combo game rather than the base game, which sounds like a lot of rather pointless dice-rolling without a lot of strategy.

I really enjoy it for what it is - a family game. It outstays its welcome with 5 or 6 players, but for 4 (just like Alhambra) it's good fun.  Yes, there's plenty of luck (just what were you expecting with a dice game?  Deep strategy?), but there are also decisions to be made - more than in Yahtzee, say.

Played the game twice, never played the original Alhambra so I can't really say anything about that. Simple dice rolling game with a yahtzee mechanism. I actually quite enjoyed it, as did my girlfriend so A++ there. Too simple for my tastes though but playable when it's hot outside and I'm feeling for a simple game.

This game represents a lot of what I dislike in dice-fests.  Annoying down time, while your waiting for your turn, good rolls versus bad rolls, and the rich get richer in this one.  Winning the special abilities breaks this one for me...  There is just way too much rolling of dice.

Alhambra is okay (6), the standard dice game is okay (6) - but combine the two (i.e. the Alcazaba-variant) and you've got something greater than the sum of its parts.  We only play 3 rounds (instead of 5). Great, fast fun!

RATING: 6
For a dice game, this one is showing its age. It feels unfinished. On one hand it wants to be a quick push-your-luck dice game (ie. Can't Stop), but goes too long. And then on the other, it's tile variant, has no luck mitigation. So, is almost totally dependent on your dice rolls. More recent games in this category, now have other actions that can be taken if your dice have screwed you over. This one does not (except for later in the game, where you can rebuild instead). With an updated variant to mitigate bad rolls, and shorten gameplay, this has potential.

RATING: 2
Played a 6 player game of this and it was terrible.  There was a lot of down time waiting for your turn and it wasn't as if you could strategize while waiting.  You can't exactly plan to roll 5 reds or 6 blues as a strategy.  Decisions were mind-numbingly easy as to whether or not to continue rolling or stick with the current count.  The only positive point is that I don't own the game and will never have to play again.

As a dice game weak on theme, it seemed a bit better than Catan the Dice Game or Yahtzee but not as good as something like Kingsburg.  (Now I know where the men from Stone Age stole that dice cup.)

Érdekes ötlet a kockát szeretők számára. A kockákon a hat területszín található. Három dobásból kell egy adott színből a legtöbbet kidobni, amit az első dobás után a játékos dönt el, hogy melyik legyen. A jó eredményeket el lehet rakni és a második-harmadik dobásban már ennyivel kevesebbel dobható további jó szín. A kezdő szerepét talán jobb nem bónuszkártyával eldönteni, mert így akár végig ugyanazon a játékoson maradhat a kezdő szerepe, amellyel erősen rosszabb helyzetbe kerül.

It's another in the string of yahtzee-like dice games, except that this is a lot closer to Yahtzee than to something actually fun. There is almost no dice manipulation at all, so you're just rolling a bunch of d6's hoping to roll well! The board game tie-in, however, is actually pretty well done: you do get the feel of competing with each other to take the lead in each of the 6 colors, and scoring happens 3 times and with similar point awards as the base game. But it's just so repetitive! In our one play (3er, all new) we decided to quit after 2nd (of 3) scoring and it was still 37min!

I like most games with dice, so I'm biased.  There are plenty of interesting decisions and you get to roll colorful dice!  It did feel a little long though.  Would like to try again, although since I gave away my copy I doubt that will happen any time soon!

IMO it's a better version of yahtzee as it adds a bit more strategy. To me, it's not very similar to Alhambra except for similar symbols/colors. This game also plays up to 6, which is a definite plus.

Dang, I guess Alhambra wasn't bad enough, so they had to turn it into a dice game!  Though to be fair, it wouldn't be quite as bad a game if it didn't drag on so freakin' long!  That, and if the terms used in the game weren't "clearly" meant to be as confusing as possible.  I was initially intrigued by the thought that there might be an enjoyable improvement over the original game, but was ultimately bored to tears.  I played a single 4-player game, and all 4 of us were hoping the game would end already so that we could move on to something fun.  Game design: 3/5  Personal enjoyment: 1.5/5  Total: 4.5/10

Euro Yahtzee!  I know this game seems to be generally frowned upon by most of the gamer-gamers I know, but I think it's a decent manipulation of the base Yahtzee "Roll three times and try to get as many of X as possible" mechanic to inject more direct competition and player interaction.  There is obviously a HUGE luck component, and sometimes there aren't many meaningful decisions to be made when the dice are against you.  Despite this, I think it's a good, solid dice-rolling game that should be pretty easy to introduce non-gamers too.  Plus it plays up to six, which can be hard to find.  But it does take a bit too long for what it is.

4/16/10: The more I play Alhambra Dice, the better I feel about the fact that I traded it away.  It's decent and an interesting translation of Alhambra to a Yahtzee-clone, but it is a good 30-45 minutes longer than it should be, and the last round feels largely superfluous, particularly with 5-6 people.  There just isn't enough to do with your last couple rolls, particularly if the dice aren't feeling agreeable.  It's alright for once in awhile, but I can think of Yahtzee clones I prefer.

[gameid=25491] is a dice game in the very light genre. A game is played over 5 rounds, each consisting of 5 turns (in a 2 player game) where you roll up to 8 dice up to 3 times in order to score as many of the same symbol. Choosing which symbol to roll and where to hedge your bets is the gist of the game.

The highest score gets a choice of 2 points or 1 point and a bonus chip. The bonus chips provide a small measure of strategy to the game and clever play of these combined with luck can make you a winner.

In uneven rounds VP are scored based on your position within each symbol (building), so it is a question of building a solid position to ensure the points fall your way when they are scored.

Our first few games very decent enough and provided some laughs when the dice came out one way or the other. My wife in particular felt slighted - she must have spent all her luck on me - but it was good natured fun.

At the end of the day the game is all about the luck, you either have it or you don't. The game in and off itself provides no challenge and there are certainly other games that works on the same level, but in a shorter time. Our games have taken around 45-60 minutes and the last play just felt overly long and not worth the effort or the time.

A decent dice game that is weakened by its attachment to Alhambra scoring. The winner of the game can usually be predicted after the first or second round, leaving the rest of the game dragging until the inevitable conclusion. Because it's a dice game, you can't reliably adopt a new strategy to slow a runaway leader. This game is probably much better with fewer players.

The basic game is like a tactical Yatchee or Pickomino.  Easy to play, choices to make and nicely presented.  The expansion to basic Alhambra version is a very good variation.  Rather than collecting currency to purchase, you use your skills at the Yatchee type dice throwing. Mind you I think the downtime with more than 3 players would put me off playing.  2 or 3 players is fine.

There are some tactical choices, but [thing=21632]To Court the King[/thing] has sort of spoiled us all by making us think laterally to reach our goals.

A real stinker in my opinion. Too much to be a simple fun game and way too random to be a "full game". When you play the game it's really only worth going for the big points - everything else just isn't worth it. So in the end the luckiest wins. I don't have a problem with that (see my comments at the Settlers Dice Game) but here there are just too many special actions whatsoever...
The graphics and the components on the other hand are really nice. If you are totally into Alhambra this might be a nice addition for your collection but stay away from this if you feel indifferent about dice game or luck driven fillers that try to be more...

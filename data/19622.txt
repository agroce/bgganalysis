Looks like a great yet simple wargame. Very dynamic, the rules are superbly written and the unit density remains sparse. You're not too bogged down in details on your turn (other than STAVKA :P) to notice what's going on. Great flow.

Ukrainne 1942-43. One of the best mid-level introductory wargames out there. Easy rules that through the use of some abstractions takes you straight to the battle without so many different rules and exceptions as other games do. It has everything a wargame should have (zones of control, supply lines, reinforcements management...).

A fantastic tense game from start till the end. Oppotunities for both sides to win or lose it. The chit drawing adds to the overall uncertainty of executing the necessary actions to bring about victory or total collapse.

One of the best 8 hour battle I have ever played. well worth every minute of it.

I played this after A Victory Denied which I prefer. However, AVL is a true gem in my opinion. Easy to learn but hard to play. Very tactical. Hard for both players for different reasons. Terrain configuration and rails are crucial. Most of the game really depends on how moving smartly along certain roads and to engage the enemy in the most advantageous terrain.

RATING: 9
The kind of fluid game of manoeuvre, attack and counter-attack that I'm really fond of.

A Victory Lost was my first encounter with the chit draw activation system. Applied to this situation - the Germans desperately trying to mount an orderly retreat and hold the line, the Soviets struggling to force a breakthrough - it creates a lot of tension. It is remarkable how Nakamura manages to vividly recreate this campaign using such simple rules and well-tried mechanics.  Of course, some detail is sacrificed and there are a couple of oddities (supply and the rail reinforcements).  

The counters are nicely done.  The map is functional if not a feast for the eye. That's winter in the Ukraine for you; an awful lot of white. As many others have said, the rule book is exemplary in its clarity.

A Victory Lost is the most excitement I've had with chits and a hex grid.

Light rules for wargame and elegant mechanics. Very easy to learn compared to many others hex games, but rules are really tight with not much extra.

RATING: 9
Excellent design. The chit-pull mechanism works incredibly well.

The game is pretty balanced, although each player has a very different objective to achieve. The first two times we played, each faction won once. 

What is really cool about the tactical dimension is that every single minor and major river counts! Just as every road and rail line counts for movement and reinforcements logistics.

I disagree from those that think it's boring to play with the Germans, that are always falling back. I think that falling back intelligently, managing your meager resources with skill and using the terrain and the ZOC "stickiness" to your favor is just as exciting as attacking with the soviets trying to punch holes in the German defenses.

But I guess the real differentiating factor of this design is the simplicity of the rules and the super streamlined sequence of play. It is a breath of fresh air in a wargaming world so full of complex games with excessive chrome. Kudos for the designer for creating an example of elegance and crispiness. 

Great fun!

Good, simple (rules wise) wargame; interesting battle, with plenty of tough decisions on both sides (the germans have the more tense game, the soviets a more frustrating one).

Also featuring one of my biggest recent unlucky runs: some romanians survived until turn 3, because in 5 attacks I never got a die roll better than a 2 (and yes, I later realized I could have simply bypassed and ignored them); in fact, my best in the first dozen rolls was a single 3... had to change dice to get anything better than that.

Wonderfully streamlined and simple to play with a nice feel to it. The chit draw activation system is well integrated and adds an uncertainty and layer to the game that is appreciated. Very fluid with tough decisions throughout as to where to put the focus of one's activities. Great fun.

Recent plays indicate that the Soviets might be nigh unstoppable once one learns how to play them. There are optional rules, however, to tilt the balance of play

Just one play so far, but a very fun game. This looks like a game that will go down to the wire every time.

I played the Germans and lost on the last turn, but I'm pretty sure I've identified some opportunities for significant improvements in my strategy.

Looking forward to trying it again.

Tough to say, as I don't have a WHOLE lot of "wargame" experience -- but it seems like the rules are fairly tight, and it's a neat system (is this system common among wargames?) Really enjoyed how the HQs dictated how and what would be activated.

That said, there is a _lot_ going on with this. Granted, this again may be a wargame issue in general, but I had trouble making any semblance of a plan -- just so many moving parts, and whenever Stavka came up, I found myself a bit of a brain burn.

RATING: 6
Not a bad game, just a bit too simplistic for my taste.
I prefer wargames with unforgiving supply rules; AVL lessens the importance of maneuver by making it too difficult to pocket the enemy and cut his supply.

Impressions after one play.  So take all this with a grain of salt.

AVL is billed as an entry level war game.  The rules are well written and pretty easy to follow.  

Essentially be a game of maneuver.  There is Combat of course, but in our initial game it seemed pretty difficult for either side to inflict any meaningful casualties.  Most encounters resulted in minor retreats.  This means that the main way people take losses when they are nearly encircled.

Clever movement is therefore essential.  In this respect it feels a bit like Bonaparte and Marengo for me.

As Russians swarm the Axis forces and it seems like the reds are looking for one big breakthrough allowing them to pour into the western side of the map to take the key VP towns.

Meanwhile the Axis need to make careful, deliberate retreats from one fortified position to another -- responding to threats appropriately without leaving big gaping holes in their line.

It's a game that feels good, and seems to succeed in modeling this particular conflict.

I also really like the asymmetrical balance between the two sides.  The Russians get more units which are a bit weaker. Once per turn they get a massive line charge where they can issue orders to pretty much every unit on the map.

The Germans meanwhile get more more turns overall and have greater flexibility in how they give orders and posses more competent commanders.

My problems with AVL is the following:

I consider myself a fairly avid wargamer but I'm not too familiar with old school hex-and-counter games (most of the war games I like the best are point-to-point).  I find the components here to be very difficult to play with.  The counters are hard to move and all clumped up together.  They also seem too big for the spaces they are in and it can be very hard to see key map features at a glance.

I found tweezers to be a necessary addition to this game.  Without them it's just too hard to move things around and get a view of the battlefield.  This to me is a mark against the game.

There is also the issue of play-time and down-time.  It's pretty long for an "entry level" war game it seems a bit on the long side.  This first game took us some 8 to 10 hours.  I figure the next game should get closer to the 6 hour mark listed here on the geek.

The down time is the real killer in this game.  While I do like the chit-pull system (players each select 4-6 commanders who have a command range.  in a turn those commanders have chits to represent them that are randomly selected.  This decides who acts when, which means one player can get several actions in a row).

While the possibility that one person gets a few activations in a row makes for some annoying down time, the REAL killer is the soviet STAVKA chit (that's the one that allows a the player to give orders to pretty much everyone on the board).  These turns take forever.  Combine STAVKA with a couple other soviet chit draws in a row and the Axis player can be sitting idle for quite some time.

This is really the double edged sword of the game, because the chit-pull activation system and the STAVKA chit in particular are some of the most intriguing parts of the game but they also cause the most down time.

If you can handle the difficult components and the downtime AVL has a lot to offer but it's weaknesses will keep it from hitting the table as often as it might deserve.

On my first solo play the Russian advance wasn't halted by Manstein but by my 3 month old son who managed to roll across the board.  Several units managed to flee but many were crushed by the baby's chubbiness.

Still, extremely impressed with the game.  The mechanics work very well and give a great feel for the armed struggle.  I guess I'll have to use VASSAL from now on.  I have no doubt that my rating will rise.

After further plays I'm very impressed.  The rules are not too complex and the movement of the troops across the map gives the impression of a titanic almost balletic struggle.

Hex based simulation of the battles around Stalingrad after the failed German relief attempt. This simulation feels epic, as men of numerous nationalities battle it out in the Russian plains during the height of winter. Yet it is also simple, with short and colorful rule book and few exceptions. Chit activation of units adds tension as it is unknown who will be first to activate groups of units. Aggressive play can trap and destroy valuable armor units, but if the activations favor your opponent the same can happen to your units. Thus the game rewards careful play even as one feels the pressure to reach objectives before time runs out! Beautiful.

RATING: 10
As is often the case with MMP, the sum of the product is better than its individual components.  In a word they are cheap.  At the same time the game is overpriced on the OOP market. 

Map: The glossy finish detracts, and if you do not place the map under a plexiglass type surface, your panzers will literally pop all over the map.  Why MMP continues to use such inferior components is beyond me, but if we continue to buy it, they will continue to sell it.

Rulebook: I am not sure what all the buzz about clarity is all about, but I found it average except for the generous use of examples.  The text itself is rather so-so, so I guess that helps us to appreciate the examples.

Tables & Charts: Except for one expanded sequence of play, everything else is found on the map.  The teeny-tiny CRT is ludicrous, and the terrain chart is hardly outstanding in terms of ease for reading.  The placement of both charts assumes both players can read sideways, and at a distance, or one of you has to take them on upside down.  Gee, how much more might it have cost to have inserted them on separate charts, one for each player?  There's room for both tables on one chart.

Counters: The tank images are a throwaway; why put money into needed things when we can just give you something you do not need?  I do like the historical period symbols used on the counters, something I first encountered, as best as I can remember, in Red Star Rising.  Once you get used to it--and it should not take long--there should not be a problem.  And the unit SP's and MP's should be a give away as to what is what.  

Why the high rating?  It comes down to the variables presented in the chit-pull system.  Both sides are presented with a choice of which HQ's go into the cup, and then must deal with the randomness of the draw.  The Soviet side has to decide, at the outset, which HQ's, including future reinforcements, will be used.  I do not understand the concerns about replayability, given the many options that can unfold in the course of the game.  It is tight and tense and fun.  I would like to see the system used in other games.

The game system is quite good. This is a game that can have a very long life thanks to the chit activation, that makes every game a bit different. There is a lot of tension thanks to the draw. This is good, but the randomness can also be a curse.
The main downside, and this weights downs my vote, it's the game extreme lenght.
This should have been a 3 hours game, but can last 6 hours. Too long.

I've played one solo game, and really like it.  

Played through move 7.5; Russian victory by about 10 points.  Remarkable reproduction of actual campaign.  Russians swept through area between the Don and the Donets, and caught the Germans in three pockets, one of them especially large (resulting in the destruction of three German panzer divisions).  In all, the Germans lost five panzer divisions in the first phase of the game.  In the extreme south the Russians took Rostov.  In the extreme north they surrounded and began reducing the entire German/Satellite force there -- but the reduction took time, and was not completed by game end.  In the north they crossed the Donets moving on Kharkov without opposition, but German reinforcements stopped them at the gates of Kharkov.  In the south the bulk of the Russian forces advanced on Stalino on a broad front between the north & south curves of the Donets.  The German panzers finally got organized and counterattacked in a maneuver strongly reminiscent of Manstein's backhand blow.  They destroyed the Russian armored forces around Kharkov & sent the Russians back across the Donets; they then swept south, destroying Russian forces between Kharkov and the Don-Stalino front and driving surviving Russian units back across the Donets.  Game's end found the German armored forces poised on the north shoulder of the southern Russian front.  It was clear that Stalino would remain in German possession but that the German counterattack would not destroy enough Russian armored units to change the fate of the game.   Projected Russian victory by 8 - 15 points.  After 7.5 turns: German:  4 cities = 20 pts + 5 Russian mech units = 10 pts  --> 30 pts total.  Russian:  1 city = 5 pts, 6 German mech units = 18 pts + 12 German infantry = 12 pts  --> 35 pts total.

Regardless, even though I don't play many "hex" wargames anymore, this one's a keeper.

Wow, a simple wargame in typical hex-counter game makes it sounds not too difficult. The length time of the game might be long but its simplicities will make you even better to play it untill finish. The theme is very interesting, playing Axis, you must defend and retreat while in the same time securing the parameters and front lines so the victory cities never felt to enemies' hand. Playing Russia, even more chalanging with amount of powerful units you must immediately gain victories by taking over the cities before the game ends ( Game ends in turns )

Good game, great rules, but somehow not that interesting for me. Maybe it´s because the chit pull activation doesn´t create the dramatic seesaw effect of I-go-You-go systems, maybe it´s the scale.
EDIT: Slight increase in rating. Probably one of the lightest games that feel like a real hex and counter game.
Stuff I don´t like:
- Distance based activation leads to odd decisions.
- occasional odd supply trace (far behind enemy lines)
- sticky ZOCs

Easy to learn, fairly fast playing. A few rules i found weird but then i wouldn't expect much less for how easy it plays. Good value for money though at the price and that's a rarity these days.

RATING: 7.5
Nice little game. Classic feel with modern touches like a chit-pull activation system. Simple CRT. Nice map/counters. One of the best rules booklets I have ever seen. Superb for newbie or experienced players. Operational scale (divisions/corps). 

Might take a little longer to play than 6 hours. I had a FtF 9 Turn game that took closer to 9 hours to play and we were moving pretty quickly. 

I am a little worried about the relatively low number of chit draws (8 to 10 per turn) having too great an impact on the early game, but it is a minor quibble. You play with the cards that are dealt (so to speak).

PROS: Very nice, clear rules. Relatively simple and straightforward. Chit draw aids repeated play and solo due to unpredictability. Variable activation marker choices also helps these two factors. Small stacking limits (2) help keep things simple. Different options for both sides to explore, especially with an aggressive, counter-punching Axis defense. 

CONS: Game length rather long considering the level of detail. Small number of activations per turn might put too much influence/impact into the draw order. Potential down time for Axis can be lengthy especially if the Soviet STAVKA chit (allowing movement of all units in range of a HQ) is drawn adjacent to other Soviet chits.

Not being an expert of the East Front and knowing little about Operation Saturn, I don't quite have a great feel for how this follows or does not follow history.  I really like the chit pull mechanism - helps to play solitaire.  I find the Soviet pace still a tricky affair - if you don't plan ahead, you reach turn 7 or 8 facing almost all of the German Panzers with no cities taken (though a mass of Axis forces are in the Graveyard!).  

Still trying to master it, but a good play and looking forward to AVD.

Nice game, simple, but I think a little long and a little fiddly for what you get out of it at the end of the day. I think it does some stuff quite well - the differentiation between the Soviet and German forces is nicely portrayed, and the desperate situation for the Germans, where they are pushed to the breaking point but have significant counterattack potential - is interesting. On the other hand, the headquarters chits are a little anti-intuitive - the HQs and their subordinate units are totally distinct, there is no need for the 1st Guards Army HQ to command the 1st Guards Army units, you can move it to wherever on the front it is needed - and getting past this mental block on keeping HQs with their units is a big deal for the Soviets. You generally want to have a couple activatable HQs in one area so you can get double and triple moves to surround and eliminate German units who generally can't react fast enough. My last gripe is the CRT which is old school to the extreme - no attacker losses at all ever if you attack at 3:1 or better, very constrained results, and it's almost not worth attacking until you can get a unit cut off. The days of these simple CRTs are history. Throw in something like Mark Simonitch did with Ardennes '44 or Ukraine '43, and you have a much more interesting game that better reflects the attritional nature of eastern front warfare. The boring and simplistic CRT here is really holding this game back.

Anyway, I'd play it again, just because it combines decent fun with quite manageable rules, and I occasionally have a craving for this sort of 'classic' wargame. But this is definitely a game that has to be played at a reasonable clip, because it's not worth more than 4-5 hours of your life, so be careful who you play with. But not a long-term keeper probably. In this class of games I much prefer the area-impulse stuff, or the more sophisticated U'43 or A'44. I think AVL does compare favorably with The Gamers/MMP's SCS series of games, not so much because it's a better system (it's not), but because it seems to have been more tightly designed as a better game.

Nice! A throwback game utilizing tried-and-true base mechanics from wargames of old but given modern tweaks. May be the best-looking, easy-reading rulebook of any wargame. The chit pull system does a fine job of modeling the inherent difficulties of command & control at the highest levels. The components are first rate: highly functional and colorful without being glaring. The "winterized" map is beautiful(especially the ice floes on the rivers). 

Update: Increased my rating a bit as the tiny hexes may be the game's only drawback - keep your tweezers handy!

Most important thing to say about this game is that it is a hell of a lot of fun to play. There are more historical treatises of the battles, more detailed simulations of the units and situations involved - but for my money this is the easiest package to "grok" while still providing plenty of period flavor and simulating the appropriate choices for either the German or Soviet High Command. Yes, i prefer the tank silhouettes to the rather modern block-cum-NATO symbols... if that is wrong, i don't want to be right.

A cartoon of a game with ugly counters and no simulation value.  Clunky old ZOC-retreat mechanics combined with a totally luck-based chit draw sequence that can see the same units move and attack many times in a row while the opponent just sits there and gets surrounded, a very bad thing in a ZOC-retreat game.  Bonus negative points for deliberately not making an online version of the rulebook available.

12+ plays, 4+ solo 
rating has risen to a 10 with repeated play

In my own work, I ascribe to the design philosophy summarized by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry:

"Design perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but rather when there is nothing more to take away."

AVL epitomizes this philosophy in wargame design, and I believe that in doing so manages to be the best wargame released in the past 20 years.

Yes, it is that good.

A creative take on the chit pull system and perhaps the most elegant treatment of supply / logistic effort of any wargame I've played.  AVL generates plenty of tension and challenges both players with opportunities to attack and defend, often during the same turn.  The strengths and weaknesses of their respective forces are also captured well and simply.

The game has an elegance, and succeeds so well that I wish more designers would study it and learn from its art.

True, it takes a long time to play to completion, but no more so that other operational games of similar scope.  Yes STAVKA turns can be long, but most games in essence *only* have STAVKA turns, I'll take the tension of AVL's chit pull system any day.

AVL is a game that makes it tough to enjoy other games and their ham-handed chunkiness.

AVL deserves all the awards it won, and among all OOP games is most deserving of a reprint.

This having been said, to enjoy AVL, one must except its chit pull based treatment of logistical concentrations or "HQs".  Particularly in how it allows units within the sphere of several HQs to be activated several times a turn while other units are not allowed to activate at all.  This is both a simplification and an exaggeration of the impact of logistics that I had a hard time accepting at first, and I accept now only because it leads to such a tense, fantastic game.  The result delivers plausible historical results, while really casting both players in the mindsets of their historic counterparts.  

In other words, the rules while simple and ahistorical produce better results than many more "detailed" treatments.

The Germans start far forward but with not a ton of units. They are just five points away from winning, but those need to come from mech unit eliminations - something the soviet player is unlikely to hand you... and something that is very hard to accomplish given the 'push'-heavy CRT.

Reducing units with any real likelihood requires high odds numbers, something you probably can only achieve in good terrain with good units. Otherwise, you just get territory, not bodycount.

The HQ activations are very cool. The German has a bunch of HQs and more to come with a growing (then eventually declining) number of activations. The soviet player has three activations and a STAVKA which allows all units in command to do their thing. This capabilities are very interesting in their asymmetry.

My less-than-stellar rating is based on the fact that the counters are so small and the hexes are so small and there are so many (yeah, I know, not that many for a wargame), that I have trouble processing the terrain and troop strength info to have a good time.

That said, I expect that future plays will reduce the headache and I'll get used to it. Next play, I might replace the HQ chits with numbered cubes. They'd be easier to see and differentiate from units.

Great game!  Simple mechanics that mesh together in a way that is more than the sum of their parts.  Very fun.

RATING: 9
Simply an astonishing example of how disparate mechanics (chit pull activation, simplified command and control, streamlined exploitation) coupled with a relatively bloodless CRT can nonetheless produce a tense and fascinating game of the turning point on the Russian Front.  Abstractions accomplish what many other more detailed systems have failed to achieve.  Definitely replayable.

RATING: 6
My initial playing was fun - but it was no three hour experience.  Much longer, in fact.  I was hoping for something that could be played rather quickly, but I think it lends itself to analysis paralysis.  It's clean, streamlined, and without the usual wargame chrome.  That's the upside and the downside of it.  To be honest, it almost feels like playing some sort of Go variant with the way the CRT is structured.  I also wish the hexes were bigger, since it's tough to see what sort of terrain you're on and rivers and such.  This is also a problem because units tend to get surrounded - so there's a big blob out there and it's tough to see what's happening.  Despite these knocks against it, I think it's a good game.  It's a tense experience and there's lots to think about.  It just doesn't necessarily scratch the wargame itch that I sometimes have - and it's much longer than I initially thought.

RATING: 5
1. Design - climatic cold map, counters are clear made with two kinds of symbols (you choice which use) for a mechanized units.
2. Mechanics - simple rules, fast to learn.
3. Play - game is fast for a wargame. For someone is this a objection, for others not. Game has disputable level mechanics solution  at German Panzer Divisions strength factors, unit locations and time of arrival reinforcements, IMO to balance the game.
Main problem is scope of the game - three main events: two Soviets offensives and German counteroffensive are fluid, with no constant frontline situations, where units tangle and dance against enemy, try to outmaneuver him. Add to this Clausewitzan friction and slowly wearing off units.
AVL shows Soviet steamroller and German uber-Manstein units jumping magically from one end of the board to the other.
Design for effect. If we follow history, we don't achieve historical result. It's more like wargame puzzle, than historical simulation.
I'm not convinced if I like it.
After couple of next plays, I'm convinced, that game is too random for me - gaming skills not awards players, when chit sequence is not favorable, especially, when chits comes at streaks. Flawed mechanics.

EXCELLENT rulebook with clear wording, abundant and lavish illustrations of examples, and on top of that some very tense and exciting gameplay.  Well done MMP and Adam Starkweather for bringing another of Tetsuya's excellent games to the US!

This is a superb wargame.  I like the asymmetry of the sides; Germans are few but moblie and deadly, the Soviets are many but weaker and sluggish).  The chit selection is fun and adds tension.  Maneuver is key, particularly for panzer divisions.  Causing your enemy to retreat into one or more ZOCs is great fun, especially when using a weaker unit as a backstop.
The bold, colorful counters look great against the ice blue hexes.  The rulebook is nice too; the rules are on the lower complexity side which gets greenhorns playing the game and not looking up rules and exceptions.

RATING: 8
Probably the clearest wargame rulebook I've ever read.

Beautiful components. Its a nice touch that duplicate counters are provided for those who prefer the silhouettes vs the NATO symbols for the armor. Low counter density.

The gameplay is tense and the chit draw can be agonizing. The Soviets start out with an almost overwhelming tide of units heading west. The Germans need to pay attention to the VPs, rather than trying to win every battle. An organized retreat and intelligent deployment of reinforcements will give them a chance to hang in there until the tide swings back their way (a bit). 

The play time is a bit longer than what the box indicates, in my experience, but I can see how with 2 experienced players it will speed up.

RATING: 8
Excellent candidate for wargame novices. It will take them longer than a session to finish their first game, but multi-session gaming is part of the grognard experience. A light wargame you can teach to children and to that stubborn old man you visit once a week in the nursing home (they get lonely in there, you know).

THE GOOD: Great-looking map, I have never seen better rivers; Nice counters, non-NATO symbols do not bother me; Random chit pulls add to the chaos, add extra layer of strategy (which chits do you put in the cup?); Rulebook is visually stunning and easy to understand, you will grok this system in a few turns; plays differently every time, decent solitaire experience.

THE BAD: Only 1 scenario included, historically there were a series of operations ("Little Saturn", "Gallop", "Star") in this region that could have been modelled as seperate scenarios; Counters/hexes are too small, but I understand the desire to keep the map size small; CRT is a bit simplistic, but this is arguable point; Retreat rules are a bit tricky to understand, could have used a better example.

THE UGLY: Nothing, except for the totally unrealistic supply model.

8/10.

My first played campaign level wargame.  The game simulate very real situation of the battlefield.  German must retreat to Donets River-Don River-Manych River line.  He can seek opportunity to counterattack Soviet units once they appeal weak point during advancement.  
On the other hand, soviet player should try to close to vp city asap.  He should notice gather his troops advancing together.

A great game.  Very tense, and chit selection means players must be flexible to respond to new crises or uncoordinated movements.  Despite some complaints that this means "it's all luck" that is not the case.  One must be a considerate planner.  Only downside is silly supply rules that could have been easily fixed and the fantastical ability to be able to railroad 200 miles behind the enemy's lines (which can lead to "gamey" victories).  Nonetheless, a corker.

RATING: 7
A very well crafted game which is a nail-biter, but the clever chit-pull turn mechanism really dictates what kind of game it's going to be - this ensures replayability on the one hand, but also injects an extreme element of randomness.  The game unfolds deliberately, but creates an expectancy of a break out which never really occurs - this is not ahistorical, it's just that you seem to forever wait for fast flowing action which never occurs, particularly for the Russians who are very slow.  The components are excellent, but the map hexes get very crowded and should have been enlarged.  

I guess that, in the end, I am just not sure how this one will stand the test of time.

RATING: 7
Initial rating after some ftf time and solo play.

This game manages to breath new life into a traditional hex/zoc/turn-based wargame with the addition of the chit draw system, minimal supply rules and HQ's.  It's a good scenario, with tough decisions that need to be made each time a chit as drawn, including the initial HQ selection by the Soviets that will determine their overall plan. It also has one of the nicest rulebooks I've ever seen.

I should mention that this is a fun game, but hardly a simulation. There's no HQ activation restrictions, which means the general Russian strategy is to pile a bunch of HQ's in the same general area as a bunch of units, since any HQ can activate any unit. This can lead to some gamey strategies. The Stavka turns can create some serious downtime. Too many consecutive chit draws at the wrong time can be fatal.

I've also docked my rating a bit for some production issues, including the lack of baggies, and the decision to provide two sets of counters for the mechanized and armor units instead of giving me something useful, like attack markers, which would be nice for the Stavka turns. Plus, this game is seriously overpriced in typical MMP fashion.

Sold.

RATING: 10
This is an outstanding introductory wargame. The rulebook is nearly flawless, with simple explanations and a multitude of examples. The gameplay itself is very fun and intuitive for both beginners and seasoned wargamers alike. The forces for each side are modeled in such a way as to play differently and to mimic their real-world counterparts; the Russians are a wall of bodies with crippled movement and the Nazis are outmanned, but make up for it in maneuverability. There are numerous interesting decisions to make and they are quite varied over the course of the game, due to differences in reinforcements and the need to stay within your supply lines. The design really takes into account many of the elements of more complex wargames, but in a way that is very accessible to any player. My most sincere thanks to Mr. Nakamura and Adam Starkweather for the design/development and to Multiman Publishing for releasing this top-notch product. Boys, you had me at "hello" and now for the remainder of the series.

Gorgeous map, rules and counters. I really like this game but unfortunately several of my friends claim it's too basic. I don't think they have actually played it, if they had they would have realized how much thought and planning there's involved to play it well. It's not about attacks it's about punching holes in lines, have your HQ within range and then exploit those breakthroughs. Not as easy as it sounds. The chit pull system is cool too.

Does this game live up to the incredible hype? Well, yes and no. 

It a very good game. It reminds me very much of another recent release- Red God of War by Brian Knipple (Avalanche Press). Both games have a similar theme, similar chit pull command mechanics, and even a similar gameplay feel. Folks who love Victory Lost might do well to check out Red God of War. The rules, however, is where the similarity ends. Victory Lost has one of the best rulebooks I've ever seen, with practically no necessary errata items. The answers to all your questions are there, if you read carefully. In contrast, the Red God of War rules left a lot to be desired, and a fair number of errata items are necessary to play the game. 

My rating may go up over time. So far, I like the game and it's approach to subtlely simple mechanics which can give rise to complex situations. The gameplay itself is not so different from a dozen other games I've played. I don't get quite the same thrill from playing it that Von Manstein's Backhand Blow provides me (same subject matter), but Victory Lost is probably the better balanced game from a purely "game" perspective. 

I'm not entirely sure I endorse the chit pull mechanic, whereby formations activate in random order, and certain units can activate multiple times. Depending on the luck of the draw, the game can be rather heavily skewed towards one side or the other, especially early in the game if the Russians draw their command chits at the right times. It feels to me like the luck factor invovled in the chit pulls is a bit too much. It will take more plays to find out for sure.

I would almost call this a perfect old school hex and counter war game. It's simple with easy to digest rules, well written. There are enough subtleties in command and timing to give it replayability. And it has some tweeks that raises it above most old school operational games. The only criticism I have is the simplistic supply rules make for some odd and unrealistic supply routes and reinforcement.

RATING: 7
A Victory Lost shows how good a simple game can be when it's built around a strong central theme. Here the chit pull to activate formations mechanic is taken to a new level of sophistication. Soviet chits activate specific formations (or all units), making them a strong but inflexible steamroller. The Axis receive steadily more chits as they respond to the Soviet offensive, and these allow them to choose which formation to activate, and even to activate the same formation twice in a row. This, combined with their strong but rare mechanized units makes them a rapier to the Soviet broadsword. The result is an exciting game with good history and a lot of flavour for two very different opponents - all in a very easy to play package.

Victory accomplishes this through a ruthlessly disciplined design; everything but the chit pull system is kept extremely simple. There are no armour reaction or exploitation rules - these are reflected in the chits.Terrain effects and the odds-ratio combat system are ur-wargame basic. All units are divisions, which keeps stacking simple (sub-division and higher level support units are factored in).

I do have a couple of reservations: the lack of support units, combined with the low stacking, makes it very hard for the Soviets in particular (who lack elite Panzer divs) to mass strong odds in the attack. I can accept this might be a deliberate design decision, but the CRT is just wrong. Lacking any mixed results, only the losing side ever takes step losses - which just doesn't reflect the attritional nature of WWII combat. Attackers often took severe losses even when they succeeded in pushing the defender out of a position. Not only is the CRT ahistorical, the winner gets off scot-free results may also contribute to the game's tendency to swing wildly in favour of one side or the other (I've had blow-outs as both the Soviets and the Axis). Fix the CRT and I would rate this great game a 9 - perhaps a 10. Even as it is, it's a solid 8.

Fun game when playing the Russians. Picking on hapless Germans and their Allies who for several turns cannot move. Or, just far enough to get surrounded. And, the Russians know this how? Just like in A Victory Denied. Counter values are too low and the CRT is easily gamed. No fog of War with both players knowing again way too much. The chit-pull system (and the luck you can get from it) is how the game is played, gamed, and won. What fun.

Update 14-11-2011:
This game works best solo or via email. As a solo games it is like a puzzle and via email the first three turns aren't so boring for the German as in the face to face games.

--------------------------

Update 22-08-2011:
The game is great, but I don't see the game time shortening. We still play this at the phase of 1 hour / turn. 

--------------------------

Victory lost is a very easy and fun game to play, but it could be a bit shorter. 

This is a very simple, but excellent hex and counter game with chit pull mechanism. Chit-pulling adds nice uncertainty to the game. CRT is cleverly done to encourage encirclements rather than straightforward assaults. Map is also excellent. I like this game a lot, but the length bothers me a bit. Expect your first game to take around 8-9 hours. Average with experience is propably around 5 hours.

RATING: 6
I am torn on this one - on one hand I welcome the influx of japanese wargame designs, there is something about the methodical and careful approach that these designers usually have. The scenario is most certainly extremely balanced and presents an interesting strategic decision. On the other hand I find aspects of the gameplay rather dull - the CRT is very boring, the axis player fears the Russian player drawing the Stavka chit as he then has to wait for ages to see him move move endless little counters that might even never see combat. Finally the Russians have to collect huge forces to drive the Germans out of the cities on a lucky roll, while German game play is mostly about placing blocking stones and hoping to get them in place before the Russian draws the necessary chit.
All in all not a game I see me playing often - there are so many more flavourful games out there, and the chit pull system has been done in more interesting ways already (Glory series, Across 5 Aprils come to mind)....
Commendations to MMP for the mistake free and absolutely clear rulebook, though!

RATING: 8
Nice, clean wargame which has a simple ruleset, and yet gives players a variety of tough decisions to make and also strongly captures the flavour of the campaign. The chit draw system really adds tension to the game, i.e., can the Germans get away in time?, can the Russians close the trap in time? etc. One minor complaint is the CRT. There's no real uncertainty for some of the results, like when the Russians attack the Axis Minor - pretty much certain death for the Axis Minor. Wish this game was shorter too.

This is a very good game. The rules are as smooth as silk. In fact, any grognard already knows them and except for the chit pull sub-system this game could have been produced in the golden age of wargames. Though its rule book is a modern marvel (clean, elegant and extensively illustrated rules being a feature one is not accustomed to seeing in wargames. As an example, supply problems are abstracted out via HQ activation limits: units rarely activated had their supplies diverted by higher authorities - voila). 

The only criticisms I have are that HQ do not have to activate the units under them in the OB, they activate any unit within a command range. So why color code units by army? (I know it helps in the set up but why is that all it does?) For perfection, I'd have added either a mech movement phase or overruns, and provided a few scenarios, such as a free set-up or an alternate start date. But these are at best minor points as multiple activations of adjacent HQ's can create a virtual exploitation phase and scenarios can be published anywhere.

So, all in all, we have a game that is a breath of fresh air and one all wargamers should play at least once.

My new favorite wargame.  So much is packed into so few rules.  I read the rules twice, and by turn two I never had to open them again.  Both sides get to take their turn conducting slashing attacks, cutting off supply to pockets of the enemy, and running away from mad steamroller offensives.  I'd put this game right up there with my other two all time favorites Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage and Breakout: Normandy.  Easily a 10.

Be warned, this is a two session game the first few games.  Lots of decisions. More down time for the Germans but they have tougher decisions to make regarding HQ choices.   A bad Chit pull order can be rough going for the Germans but you gotta deal with what is dealt.

See review.  I think this is a fantastic game, slightly Euro like in how tight the mechanisms are and how completely without chrome it is.  Unfortunately, I find it a bit dry for those very reasons!  Sometimes I have the game out and just cannot motivate myself to finish it--a rare thing, especially with a game that is this well suited to solo games.  Almost all my games of this are, in fact, solo, so perhaps this is coloring my view.  I do believe that this will be huge on the competitive wargames circuit as it plays in a reasonable amount of time, is competitive and could lend itself to many plays and highly refined strategies.

Update 11/07:  I've played some competitive PBEM and in person games and my feelings are the same, it's an intensely competitive and finely balanced game that doesn't have enough spice for me to bring to the table with my local wargame opponent.  I'd invariably rather play something else, but this game is an excellent design.  It's a very calculated exercise with lots of hex counting.  The key seems to be getting into just the right command overlap positions where multiple HQs activate the same unit over and over.

If I were going to play this, I would instead play a Fast Action Battle game every single time.

Great fun. Simple but with hard choices. Some say the chit pull can destroy game balance. I don't agree you just have to try and cater for all possibilities. You are never in a safe situation - I like that in a game

Very simple design that harkens back to earlier days, with one simple, but novel twist...the command chits and unit activations.  This is what makes the game interesting and different.

[update]  I've raised the rating to an '8' after further plays.  I would never have guessed that I would have enjoyed this game as much as I have.  Don't be put off by appearances.  The chit draw/activation mechanism makes this game much more than the sum of its parts and makes every play quite different.

RATING: 8.5
- classical hex and counters with few logical rules.
- interesting historycal situation
- really nice activation sistem with chit and HQ, but the plus here is that the number of chits dependes on the turn, so for the german it show the increasing escalading reaction, furthermore the german player have "manstein chit" that allow to activate whatever HQ you want. opposite to the Soviet that have less flexibility but have the powerfull stavka
- be aware, in this game you need to surround and poket your enemy, frontal attack give DR, DR, DR... 

At the end a must have and must play for any east front grognard

RATING: 5
after several plays, the initial good impression has worn out.  The Soviet strategy requires the gamey tactic of multiple activations of the same units, and an attack along a narrow front.  It also requires a lucky distribution of chit draws to surround superior German units, and above average luck on 50-50 die rolls (1.5->3:1 attacks).  The Stavka chit is also a major interest killer as the German player can disappear for 30 minutes and not miss anything.  Realistically, this game is going to take 1 hour per turn if your are analyzing all of your potential moves, giving a play time of 9 hours; this is too much for a luck-filled unrealistic game.Against a skilled German player, I am also not convinced that the game is balanced.  The "backhand blow" is unlikely to fail, assuming the German player preserves the panzer divisions.

(1) Looks easy-playing and fun, yet still with an epic scope.  Eager to try it out.  Just started a game via VASSAL.

2006/12/29: Played 6 turns of a face-to-face game with the outcome still in doubt.  I think it's a good game, but the 3-4 hour playing time listed on the box is a bit optimistic.  A STAVKA activation can easily take as much time as all the other activations put together.

I wanted to have a go at a "quintessential" hex and counter wargame, and this is highly thought of. So far, only played solitaire, but I found it interesting, if a bit fiddly for my aging eyes and fumbling fingers (even though the stacks are at most height 3 and most are 2). I'd really go for a scaled up version. Maybe I'll make one someday... The playtime is long enough that PBEM, or even solo play on the computer is probably the most likely option, and the VASSAL module does some nice housekeeping.

RATING: 8
A great situation gives often great starting point to designers for a good game. 
In my opinion this is the matter with this really good game.

But in my opinion this is not a true simulation. 
It miss completely the logistical burden on the german side and forgets the Hitler's defensive syndrome, two very important situational aspects. 
These coupled with the high movement rate of german mech units and the "ghost Stalingrad" gives the german player a liberty of choises he never enjoyed.

It's also a long game to play, albeit a very exciting one.
Nevertheless, a great game to play with.

RATING: 9
Very good: Operational - Eastern Front - WW II Easy

Plus:
-Best design I have seen in many years
-Great HQ activation system
-Very simple yet very sophisticated rules
-Accessible, almost jump and play
-Quick playing (game length is a different matter)
-Unsurpassed strategic manouvring game
-Demanding for players (especially the Germans)
-Great mix of counter density / manouvring
-Extremely tense

Contra:
-Hexes/map should have been a bit bigger
-Fysicalpresentation. Overall good quality and nice map but counters look a bit cheap (I prefer Nato symbols but this is nitpicking). Would have loved a 'deluxe version'
-Only one scenario (but it is a darn good one....)
-The rail lines rule for reinforcements is questionable;
The only way for the Russians to get the reinforcements to the South is to free the Northern rialway. You have three turns and three Coprs to do the job but competent German play is able to prevent this. 
If the Russians fail to take the railline, a lot of units get clogge dup in the North, taking forever to Reach Kharkov. Only after the 4th turn Stalingrad is able to open the rail lines to send reinforcements but this is too little too late as the Germans have received enough reinforcements by then.
-The lack of chrome guarantees a streamlined design but  gives a less evocative feel.

Despite some contra's, where many wargames bog down in process and rules, here gameplay is so attractive and refreshing yet comprehensive. This is one of the best intro hex & counter wargame imo. 

Strategically deep but with a core system as complicated as Memoir, yet so sophisticated.
A very good; very accesible, playable and above all very affordable Hex & Counter wargame.

Bottom line:
Streamline designs cause discussions (see minus points) but in the end it is a great came that I pull out again and again because of it: quickplaying, tense, strategic.

Balance is good but a russian win depends largely on:
1) Lucky HQ chits
2) German Mistakes 
A combination of these 2 is usually lethal for the Germans.

Verdict: balanced with the Germans better to think twice about each move. 

Brilliant game.

It's not that the game is bad, it's just that i apparently don't like operational war games.
Without FoW this becomes but a mere mathematical equation to solve, a bit like mine-sweeper. You're constantly comparing odds & count movement points, nothing else.. no bluffing or anything. That's not enough to invoke the theme at least in my mind.

I think these operational war games are somewhat of a dying breed but i might be wrong.
If you should like 'em or want to get to know them this title is a great, simple & streamlined introduction to the many OCS (operational combat series) titles.

Initial rating partial play, could rise a little with full play 

Excellent very standard rules operational H&C, about as standard as it comes, I would say “generic” but that would be misleading since its often negatively associated, also even though there is only one scenario it’s a really neat one and really makes the game into more than sum of parts/rules

Really easy to learn for wargame due to the above, definitely fun and some nice tension here. CRT seemed a little tough, you need really high odds to give yourself a chance to do damage but then many are like that too, just don't expect a lot of combat with a lot of action and losses as its not set up that way. Instead, this would seem to indicate maneuver and positioning is even more important than mounting good attacks many times, and with the many "retreat" results the CRT hands out you need the enemy retreating through your ZOC to inflict a loss. On that note ZOC’s seemed a little tough too, they really limit movement, especially at beginning. OOS rules not too harsh compared to other games, but still something to shoot for.  This game really shows you don’t need pages of exception riddle chrome to make a  good game, rules were really well done and written well too less a few redundancies I could have done without (much better than holes though)

There are some complaints of luck, downtime and game is too long for what it is, these are the ones I noticed and gave me pause anyway. After playing I can see exactly where people are pointing to; the chit pulls can ding you at bad times (as can the dice of course), when the Stavka chit is pulled the Russian moves everything so opponent does have to wait (but not more than other games where they do whole turns anyway), and 6 to 8 hours for this might be a tad long. However, I think for every person who views these as bugs, 10 others will see them as features. Really if you know the game is 6-8 hours before playing then that shouldn't bother you (4 or 5 would have been awesome for this though), also downtime only happens on one activation out of 8 or 10 or so, and its only for the movement since attacks involve both so I did not see this as an issue.  

As for the chit pulls, you can see below I was quite worried about this before playing and interesting enough, what I was worried about actually happened, the Russians right at beginning of game got 3 turns in a row before Germans could react, and while strong, it really did not seem to be an issue less the planning issue I mentioned (of course later in the game this could be much more detrimental though) and note that of course the German basically ended up getting 3 turns in a row later as well. Also, OOS is not checked to end of turn, so while 3 turns in a row could be tough to recover from on occasion the opponent is likely to get 3 turns in a row later to undue some of the damage (but due to how ZOC’s work, likely not all so there is a luck factor here for sure), its still equal turns just random timing, so different and interesting but could sting you at bad times and does make planning very tough as I alluded to below. Anyway right now, this is not an issue for me or just a small one, planning is hit or miss I think here but I guess that is part and parcel and note of course it does inject some tension in the game for sure. 

I really need to play a full game, but so far I think this is a really good pure H&C that will be easy to pick up and play after a layover with only 13 pages of "light" rules, too bad its OOP I'd like a copy for my collection    

----------

Whoah, I'm itchin to play this but damn reading the rules and seen that the active player is determined by a chit pull, so one player could even go 3 times in a row. How the hell can you even plan with that kind of randomness? Things could get crazy swingy for sure too, imagine the carnage and units left OOS after opponent takes 3 turns, yikes (I don't have a problem not knowing what HQ's opponent will activate, that is just good FOW, my issue is not knowing which HQ's of MINE will activate, and when). This might be tense and fun though as many point to, just not sure about the lack of control. 

Maybe it's not as bad as it sounds, but its a red flag to me so far in what otherwise looks to be a cool rules light game

RATING: 8
Rules are actually easier than I anticipated.  Components look FANTASTIC.  I am currently getting the Nazis annihalated as a result of my incompetance . . . lots of interesting decisions every turn - this one's a definite keeper.

Update: FINALLY - the "next step" wargame I've been looking for.  I find Memoir far too simplistic for my tastes; Silent War and Twilight Struggle are marvelous games, but don't scratch the same itch; ASL SK#1 was too much to chew - while I could digest the rules, I was always too worried about them to immerse myself in strategy and tactics.

This, however, is right in my wheelhouse.  Rules are simple as pie, (but don't mistake that for lack of depth in gameplay).  Lots of tactical problems to wrap your brain around, and VERY different strategic challenges for each side.  

One downside - my huge, troll-like hands have trouble with the half-inch counters and small-ish hexes, particularly in the early stages of the game where the fronts are tightly packed.  But I think that's a fair compromise in a game that I paid less than $30 for (and that's with shipping included).

Played well solitaire - now it's time to take my game online and get my arse handed to me . . .

RATING: 6
Interesting, back-to-basics hex-and-counter wargame. Rules presentation is gorgeous, in full color and with many illustrated examples.

Gameplay didn't impress me much, though. For an "introductory" wargame I found it very fiddly, big, and long - my first game saw me and my opponent spend *three hours* to finish just the first two turns (out of nine)! Most of the game's mechanics are, if not dated, then at least very "retro" and someone who hasn't been playing wargames since the sixties could jump right into this one. The only somewhat original element in the design, impulses, didn't work that well for me. I had thought that the mechanism would result in a smoother, more interactive (and faster) gameplay, but it actually seemed to make the game play slower than it would have with a regular igo-hugo mechanism.

I was also somewhat disappointed with the way HQ activation of units worked. Why go to all the trouble of color-coding units and HQs for setup purposes, only to have formations be entirely irrelevant for gameplay purposes? With the exception of interaction between different Axis minor formations, formation doesn't mean a thing in the game, which feels decidedly odd.

So, having only brief experience with the game, what can I reasonably conclude? I can't really say whether it's a good, competitive game, or whether it models reality well (or even if it's just able to provide realistic end results). I do feel it is fair to comment on the various rules that strike me as odd. Game length is an issue too: For people who play just somewhat slowly, the game *will* be long. And it will feel slow; many activations consist of moving a handful of units 1 or 2 hexes each, followed by a number of combats, many of which will have no effect. It's a type of game where it will be difficult for someone watching the game to see that *anything* is happening.

So, in conclusion, while the game was reasonably interesting, apart from the well-written rules I don't see why AVL has been hyped to the degree it has. I also don't see why it's being touted as the ideal introductory wargame. It may provide a good match and the rules are relatively simple, but the game is long and play feels slow. Of course, a beginning wargamer may easily like the game, but I can't help thinking that there would be so many other wargames a beginner might like even better.

Easy to set up ,learn and play... but a challanging game for novice and grognard. The command/chit system makes the players act and think like their real world counterparts. The vagrancies of the chit pull can lead to a blow outs. but what the heck, just set up and play again.. I will stick my neck out and vote that the Soviets are a slight favorite to win, but nothing that can't be adjusted by using one of the optional rules the design team has provided for just such an eventuality. Note that this game takes a long time to  play

First impressions from ftf play are positive - clean and smooth system that plays almost effortlessly, allowing players to focus on the decisions.

Two things hold my rating back: (a) it feels very fragile in play (a mistake or backfired gamble can snowball rapidly into an unfortunate board position) and (b) the "assault trains" which allow the Russians to rail forces into the German rear area.  As the Russians, I needed to point (b) out in my first ftf game to prevent such an occurence from spoiling an otherwise pleasant play.

Recently docked it two points for its length - it runs much longer (6-8 hours) than advertised and this makes it a large investment of time and resources for such a fragile game situation.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Played three times.  Has a lot to recommend it.  The basic idea is that ZOCs are really sticky but the CRT is rather bloodless unless you can force retreats through your ZOC.  In terms of gameplay this translates into the fact that [i]mobility[/i] is what makes units more lethal.  The Russians have lots of plodding units, while the Axis have wimpy minor powers that act as speed-bumps, but the Nazis themselves are extremely mobile.  This mechanic is coupled with an activation sequence that is dependent on chit pulls.  The Russians will get four activations, with one being an "activate everything" chit, while the Nazis will have a variable number of activations each turn.  This means that each player is attempting to maintain focused momentum by activating the same units several times in a row, but the luck of the draw will stymie best intentions.  

Worked very, very well on VASSAL.

A deceptively simple game.  The ZOC rules coupled with carefully chosen movement factors create a simple, subtle and very clever depiction of the differences in force composition, training, doctrine and the need for combined arms.  The chit system manages to encompass the principles of supply, intel, der schwerpunkt, decision cycles etc without all the fuss.  AVL should attract the interests of the new and the jaded with its simple rules, reasonable playtime, tough contest and good history.  Highly replayable, loads of tension on both sides, and gets better with every turn.  A game can be completed in an evening or strung out over a weekend, depending on how long the players want to agonize over the many challenging decisions. 

The lavishly illustrated rulebook and the excellent MMP-supported VASSAL module (for live or PBeM computer play, PC or Mac) set high standards for the wargame community.

The playtime claim is a bit silly.  Full games can easily go 2-3x as long.  The 2007 WBC final reportedly lasted over 10 hours (and the players probably felt like Ali and Foreman after the Rumble in the Jungle).  

Two years later update: upped to a 10.  I can't think of a game that so well follows the credo of taking rules out until there are no more rules that can be removed.  It's only drawback for me is that I feel I am at risk for a heart attack every time I've played it, so if I don't feel of stern stuff I might beg off a game.

RATING: 5
Average hex-and-counter wargame with a chit-pull system for activation of HQ's (and the combat units in their zone of command) and set on the Eastern front near Stalingrad during WW2. I like this chit-pull system and how it determines which units can be moved and/or combat. Rules are simple and the rule book is excellent. But: this is a long game with considerable downtime, especially when the Soviet player has to activate the Stavka chit. The Soviets also have to concentrate huge forces to get the Germans retreating from behind rivers. The overall impression was a rather tedious game play without much tension and movement. **** First and probably last game abandoned after 4 hours playing time [without rules reading] and nearly two (of potentially nine) turns [last turn still needed the Soviet stavka chit] - I played with the Soviet-Union.

RATING: 7.5
A very solid, very playable game. It's really nice to see a wargame without errata or sloppy design for once. Unless you're a complete wargame newbie you can be up and playing this without any rules issues within 15 minutes and as a result it is one that I expect to be coming back to for years.

My biggest complaint is that it just takes a little long and especially considering how simple it is this can become a bit tedious (specially when the Stavka chits come out..). I'd really have loved this if it played under 3 hours but as it is I think you are pushing it to finish under 5.

My only other major complaint is that due to the lack of chrome and the simple graphics its difficult to really get into the theme, most of the time it just feels as though you are moving generic units of an unknown scale across a generic white field of unknown scale. Some more designations on the units and a more detailed and realistic looking map would have gone a long way for me, even if it did have a minor impact on the usability.

Finally a war game where the rulebook is so clean you don't need to download a 100 page errata/Q&A to get going.

Good rulebook doesn't make A Victory Lost a good game though. Biggest flaw is that its way, way too long for what it is. German player can go to the movies, watch the movie and come back while the russian player plays his STAVKA turn and not miss a thing.

Great fun playing this East Front, Operational level wargame. The rules are well-written and straighforward. The gameplay is balanced, while the gamer decisions are "wargame-y" and fun. An old-time cardboard pushing frenzy, with great map and counters. Reminds me of the old Avalon Hill classics. Agree that it might be too long for what it is, (also like an AH classic).

Bog standard 1970s ZOCker wargame except for the chitpulls... which make no sense since they make some units stick in place and other lurch forward multiple times.  Might make sense in an ACW tactical game... doesn't make sense in a WW2 operation environment. Classic "Action-over-Function" design that is exciting to play but bears no relation to history in how you play.

Beautifully made and fun to play.  As is often noted, the game is kind of a throw-back to the Hex/CRT/ZOC designs of yore, but still seems fresh.  The chit pull system is great, too.  AVL takes everything I liked about "Blood & Steel", then expands and improves it.

Clean, simple, and minimalist. Design for Effect school. Playable in one 8+ hour session. Counters are crisp and functional the way I like them. I'm particularly happy that silhouette counters are only optional, as I much prefer symbols. Map is outstanding.

Weaknesses:
The Stavka chit slows the game down too much and seems to be too strong an advantage for the Soviets. The Soviets seem to be 2-1 favorites although a lot rides on the chit pulls in any particular game.

2 / 5 - Fair.

The game manages to find real tension, a good level of simulation and some excruciating tactical choices off the back of readily digestible rules, which is all very good. However, the game does suffer from some administration problems. Firstly the important tactic of activating units multiple times per turn with different HQs requires a lot of fiddling around to find "perfect" positioning for that HQ. Secondly the STAVKA turns for the Soviets, where they move all their units, cause horrible downtime. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I've only played once, but it seems to deserve it's excellent reputation. Having to choose which chits to put into the cup each turn makes for some very tense decisions and adds in a bit of fog of war. I don't quite get the 'ninja' style rail movement or why you can trace supply lines of infinite length and complexity, but it all works as a game. Only drawback was the length - I had the impression that this was a short game, but it took us about 9-10 hours.

I have the game, and have it set up, ready to play. Not sure how it plays yet, but it looks like it will be good -- I love chit draw activation wargames. Rules are very simple and straightforward, as far as wargames go, so this should be a great game for those with little expereince in the genre. Physical components are first-rate. Design is simple but clever -- the HQs, in effect, function a little bit like the HQs in Columbia's 'Eastfront'. They can be grouped rather closely in order to carry off a large, concentrated attack. This is the first wargame in a while that got me excited to play just reading the rules.

This is a simulation of the winter offensive the Red Army took in 1942 immediately after the Stalingrad encirclement, to recover the southeastern Ukraine. 
It seems difficult to create a game for 2 players also solo playable, but here is. And playing it, it lasts not too much hours; you can end it in 3-4 hours of playing.
The chit system allows you to unknow what group of your (or enemy) divisions will move now; also the system allows a single unit to move twice or even more times in a single turn, so that objective you saw far away becomes now available to your armies.
Did you (Russian) think your offensive will bring you easily your objectives? No! you will see the German resistance heavily stiffen, and your units slowing his speed and get stopped by the Panzers and infantry arrived as reinforcements. Kharkov, Stalino, Dnepropetrovsk, Zaporozhe or Rostov (your objectives) are now a little far to catch. Now you can try to destroy German units (hungarian, Romanian or Italian destroyed units doesn't sum any point for you), but don't loose armored Russian units, because this means points for the Germans.
Not only at the tactical level, but you can play also at the Operational level, forcing Axis units into pockets to destroy them, slowly if you close their supplies.
And all that without an extensive and complicated rulebook, but only some pages.
And the Vassal module aids you to agilize some game's mechanics.
Good game.

First play, got just past Turn 2 in about three hours.  I would have loved one of the set-up diagrams recently posted here by fans; that would have been very easy.

I want to play again, but I want to have liked it more than I did.  Unless we somehow are playing it totally wrong, there is significant downtime for each player during the opponent's move, especially during the Russian STAVKA order.  There is a lot of math, of checking and re-checking totals that might have changed from moving one unit one hex.  I found the hexes too small, especially on plexiglass, and that meant the chits would overflow and sow confusion...no partisans needed!  It's a bit dry (that's both good and bad), but there was very little tension, nailbiting, or spontaneous celebration at a certain escapade gone right.  Russia pushed the Axis back and drove a wedge in the line, exactly as it was meant to do. 

Now, obviously we only played a quarter of the game, and things really begin to turn with Manstein's arrival. No question I'd play again and I'm VERY sure that it would go twice as quickly.  But due to the downtime and the relentless math (of course the math makes this system both simple and elegant), the game just got the slightest bit fatiguing.  At Turn 3, that's not what you want to have happen. 

To be updated...

AVL is a straight-forward, low-complexity wargame that has top-notch graphics and a very well-written rulebook.  The game shines because there is a lot of tension on both sides as players fight an asymetrical battle. Combined with the ZOC rules and movement allowances, the chit-pull system elegantly highlights the differences between Soviet and German command capabilities.  As an "Ost Front" buff, AVL has become one of my favorite eastern front games.  Would score an '8' if it wasn't a one-scenario game and much longer to play than stated on the box.

A slugfest with too many small counters on a big map with small hexes. I found it hard to keep track of all the different armies while following the restrictions on unit activations.  I wanted to like this game but got bored quickly playing it solo.  Really would play best with 2 players knowledgeable about this critical post-Stalingrad campaign who are willing to experiment with different strategic approaches as either the Russians or Germans. I suspect it would be epic under the right circumstances.

In a game with limited information and uncertainty, you can either decide that the future is certainly uncertain, and play without planning, or you can try to figure out every possibility and plan for every contingency. If the former, you will probably like the simplicity of AVL, if the latter you will find it very tedious.

As for me, I'm not convinced by the Chit Pull activation system, which is the main attraction of this otherwise not very original game. It makes the game rather artificial (as the key to making progress is to activate the same units several times in a row) and very time-consuming (as you must analyze to death these multiple activations when you get one, or when you figure that you are likely to get one). I understand that some players like to play without planning and without thinking too much in advance - I usually need one or two hours for a Stavka move. To play it in the spirit of the design, you'd probably need to play with a chess clock. Say, 10 minutes for Stavka and 2 minutes for all other HQs. I gave it away in 2008.

This is a well designed game that can be played largely intuitively. There is also, as I see it, much room for replayability and varying outcomes, depending on strategy and the roll of the dice. 

The CRT does not usually result in clear-cut victories and losses, but rather, slugfests in which units are forced to retreat and then can counterattack. 

I also like the size of the map, the movement rules and how the fighting can change and range all over the map. Yes, the hexes on the map are small, but the map is huge already (about 34" x 24") so I don't see an alternative to the way it came printed. I will say that the detail on the map is very impressive and had to have taken a lot of work. 

I'm not as enamored with the clarity of the rules or illustrations as some people, but it's not difficult to learn--best way is to read the rules once and start playing--and it's so well designed that the rules actually guide one toward certain strategies. 

I also like the chit-pull system of being able to move only units within command range (usually 4 hexes) of an HQ, or at times being able to move all units at once if one chooses. The former rule in particular prevents one from analysis paralysis, because there are many chits on the board and there are many decisions to be made. 

Started my first play, mid-March 2008 and completed it on April 1 after 8 sessions usually ranging from 20-50 minutes in length. In my solo replay, the Axis ended the game with 22 Victory Points to the Soviets' 13: the Soviets managed to re-take one Victory city (Kharkov = 5 points) but the difference in the game was that German Panzer units, surrounded in the city of Dnepropetrovsk, repulsed numerous and repeated Soviet attacks, while whittling down enemy forces. 

I traded it, but not because I don't think it's a very good design--just not that interested in the Russian Front theme. I did enjoy playing it. Because I'm not that interested in this theme, I prefer to play the simpler "Leningrad" or, for more detail, "Panzergruppe Guderian." Traded in spring 2008.

Comments after one play:

This game has one of the best rules book I’ve ever seen: Clear, concise, with beautiful & in color examples of play. (It is not wordy, with “got it?” comments all over the place and repetitions that I find quite irritating – No: The rule you need is in one place and linked rules are referenced by their number. That’s how it must be done, IMHO.)

The map is well done and the counters are easy on the eye. You also have the choice between silhouettes and symbols for mechanized units – a nice touch.

The game uses a chit draw system that works nicely to simulate this particular campaign and its historical swing of initiative.

The ZOC rules are easy and simulate well the exfiltration possibilities of the Germans (several Infantry divisions were saved this way) and the infiltration of the panzers when they counterattack (especially when coupled with a Manstein chit). The Soviets lack this operational flexibility: Their main weapons are their numbers (as usual) their Stavka chit and the possibility to surprise the Germans by revealing a new chit at mid-play and concentrate their forces to deliver repeated big blows. The victory conditions are well done too.

I played the Soviets and I had a great game. The situation was tense all along and the Germans almost destroyed two armies in their counterattacks: Imagine 6 Panzer divisions in 3 stacks attacking repeatedly without a single reaction opportunity for the Russians: Devastating! But the German player forgot about its supply and found his entire AGS out of supply when four Mech/Tank Corps of Group Popov reached Dnepropetrovsk, Zaporozhe and Kremenchuk at the end of turn 7. Game and War over!

Conclusion: I recommend this game and I’d be pleased to play it again: I’ll try other strategies as the Soviet and I already have a few ideas about the possibilities of the German.

I have a small regret though: The map could also have been used to simulate the situation at the start of the Stalingrad encirclement: With a little bit more counters (and ad-hoc rules – no big deal as this game is very simple to learn) several scenarios and what-ifs (the escape of the 6th Army) could have been added. But I really don’t know if the chit draw system would have worked in this case… 

UPDATE:

The supply system is too simple and easy. For instance, four bridges must be held by the Soviets in order to cut the 1PzA supply: If Rostov and two others are obvious, the easternmost (and very remote) bridge feels really gamey. A new supply rule can easily fix this, but its impact on the overall game play must be tested...

This is the game that brought me back into the hobby. The rules are a model of clarity, they're illustrated with plenty of full colour examples and the wording used leaves no place for ambiguity at all. There are so many wargames with poorly written rules that are full of holes or don't quite cover some situations that can arise that it is really refreshing to see a game with rules that are so crystal clear.

If not for its length, it would be the ideal wargame for a beginner. Don't get me wrong, it is a very deep game with plenty of excruciating choices and decisions both sides have to make, so the veterans will feel right at home but at the same time, the game's mechanisms are simple and elegant, very streamlined so it lets you focus on the tactics.

Great game.  I think this is easy enough to get new folks interested in wargames but will also keep the Old Hands of Wargaming interested since they'll keep wondering how their plan failed or, at least, how such a simple game manages to keep you interested in playing out the chits.

The components are perfect.  The counters are "simple" in presentation but perfect in functionality; the map looks great; and the rule book is what the wargaming community needs to consider expanding into (color and plenty of examples of play).  The rules also cover the basics very well without trying to 'over-detail' issues (i.e. not a lot of rules chrome, but enough detail in the game mechanics to not need the extras).

Finally, game play is quick and accessible using chits to keep both sides active almost throughout the turns.  Between the chits and multiple options either side can try, I doubt if too many games will break down into a repetitive pattern which obviously helps replay value.

A game that seemed to nicely cover that theater with a new mechanic, but as it turned out it is too long and the chit-drawing mechanism can easily lead to strange results. were the game shorter this would be OK, but playing for hours and hours and then suffer from bad chit drawing is rather unbearable. otherwise a quite OK game.

"I only hope that the Russians don't tear to many holes in the line." - Luftwaffe Lt. General Wolfram von Richtofen

I find myself repeating this same sentence in my head with each playing of AVL as the Germans.  It's a great game ... simplistic, but covers the action very well.  The chit pull activation system creates nail biting tension.  Right off the bat the Russians get to return the favor to the Germans from June '41 and kick'em in the groin.  The Russian player tears gapping holes in the German lines as the German player continually strives to buy time and retreat to the next defensive position and plug the holes with whatever troops he can scrounge up.  It's not just a race for the edge game either.  Oh no, the Germans may well need to counterattack and retake objectives depending on how successful the Russians are.  As the game moves forward the German player draws upon some very strong mobile forces that are very powerful.  This game has the best rulebook of any game I've ever seen.  The map makes me cold just looking at it!  I can only think of two things I'd change (call them pet peeves) ... it needs bigger counters for us fat fingered types and reprint the CRT and TEC on the back of the Expanded Turn Sequence.  Congrats Adam and MMP, you have a winner!

[b][u]Initial Impressions:[/u][/b]
The Axis have over extended the East front after the successful Russian Operation Uranus. The massive Russian army means to begin a major counter offensive against the Axis forces. This is the beginning of Operation Saturn. What happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object? A Victory Lost (AVL) pits the massive Russian front against the outnumbered elite Axis forces. AVL captures this moment in history masterfully and is backed by an amazing rule book.  This is an excellent game and a rare gem to come out of Japan. 

[floatright][ImageID=100350][/floatright]The Axis and Russian are asymmetrically opposed forces. The Axis must hold back the Russians using fewer forces while waiting for reinforcements and better command capability. The Axis are composed of German, Romanian, Italian, and Hungarian forces. The German units are far superior to the Russians, especially the elite German tanks divisions. Even with the superior units, the Axis must implement a fighting withdrawal or risk encirclement. The Russians have far superior numbers but their units are inferior to the Germans and must use their numbers advantage to overwhelm the Germans.

[b][u]What I dislike:[/u][/b]

[b][u]Overall:[/u][/b]
AVL is a very well designed game. It's clarity of rules make for an excellent gaming experience with no ambiguity. AVL lacks the fiddly exceptions that most other wargames include for "historical accuracy" while still maintaining a level of historical integrity. The chit pull mechanism ensures that no game will ever be the same while adding a significant level of tension.

RATING: 8
Good stuff. This is pretty hard for the Germans imo. They are severely outnumbered despite their superior strength. I would rate this higher, but there is much less for the German player to do on his turn compared to the Russians. Just not as much fun for the German player, as he will have to keep waiting for the Russians to finish playing (especially when Stavka is pulled - which allows the Russian player to activate every unit on the map that is within range of a HQ). I really enjoy the beginning of this game, but midway through the Germans really struggle to stay above water, just waiting for their 4th turn reinforcements. I would say that it is a fairly balanced game, but both sides play so differently. Never the less, I keep thinking about playing this. Plays like a champ solo. Great rule book. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Rating 3. Resigned after turn 5 as Germans in first game. I'm certain I totally dislike this chit system. You'd have to pay me to get me to play this again, although it could be an amusing solitaire game. Set-up again to try the German run-away strategy; resigned after first turn. It just may be me but this games just isn't fun as the Germans. Because of this, an introductory game this is not; the frustration level will drive new wargamers away fast.

Update: Rating 5 as a solitaire puzzle exercise. The only real tension in the game is the chit pull and that is just too much driven by luck. With the fairly long playing time it is not reasonable to play over and over to see how 'lucky' one side or the other gets in the game. Overall, the game is much like playing a lottery scratcher card, only much slower.

Just got this today 6-24-16. Very excited bout this one, looks like high quality map and components. 
8-4-16 I took my time and got a little in depth on this game. I am intrigued by Field Marshall Manstein, and one of the reasons I picked up this title was to study the sequence of events that he had a great part in affecting. I  utilized  some of the files on this game's page to enhance and assist in gameplay(thanks to everyone who has posted aids, charts, summaries, scoresheets, etc.)
It took me 2 or 3 turns to start feeling comfortable with the rule set. Not that there is any major differences from some other games, the common basics are all there, zoc, supply, combat, movement, etc. I think that where this game shines is in the chit pull mechanism(it really keeps the anticipation level high and plans are constantly changing when you don't necessarily get the chit you want, or have to wait a bit longer because the enemy got another of their chits drawn.
The minor differences took a little getting use to, especially the z.o.c. effect on movement and retreats. This makes breakthroughs and encirclements when they happen even more dangerous and costly to get out of, but once I got use to how the c.r.t. is mostly a retreat or nuetral effect chart up until 4:1 odds column, I was able to use the z.o.c. effects to help maintain an organized withdrawal as the germans(in most but not all engagements) Rivers are obstacles for the attacker to get by- as attacking across one can half the odds, roughs, and towns give column shifts, giving a lot of advantage to the defender, and thus forcing the attacker to bring overwhelming odds in some circumstances.
All in all, I really liked this game, I thought it does justice to the overall sequence of events that occured historically(if one chooses to play in a historical manner)
My one criticism is of the map and counters.
The map is well done in my opinion(quality and looks- I don't mind the "bland look" that some people have criticized, it was during winter afterall, the map is going to be white-snow covered) My issue with the map is that the size of the hexes were a little too small, they could of been either slightly bigger, or the map itself could be a little bigger in proportion to the counters-to avoid the difficulty of trying to manipulate those counters when they are bunched up in certain areas of the board.

I am looking forward to playing this again in the future as it's replay ability to me seems high. I would solidly recommend this game to any war gaming fan, especially those that may be fans of the east front of WWII and or Field Marshall Manstein.

RATING: 7
Very easy to learn. The rules are simple and based on traditional war game concepts. Zones of control, movement points, combat ratios etc. 
I would say a non wargamer could easily learn and understand the rules with just one short explanation.
The game itself is fun and dynamic. The "chit pull" activation of units adds a touch of uncertainty which I like. 
The one drawback is that it is a bit of a pain to set up and the intitial crowding of units can lead to some frustration with my "fumble fingers" knocking peices about. I really should get some tweasers.

A little to add to the many comments already posted. One of the best strategic games with the easiest playability I ever seen. A must have. Another Japanese (Mr. Nakamura) superb game design about the topic. I recommend to all of you to take a look at Mr. Yamazaki works about the East front. Amazing. http://www.mas-yamazaki.net/sixangles.html

The only possible game drawback could be counters managing that can become a nightmare most of all on crowded areas, something very usual. A possible solution is using the Vassal module of AVL that is a great version with useful functions such as HQ command range visualizaction and stacking analisis. Great game for solitaire playing too.

RATING: 6
A straight-forward wargame. The chit system makes the Axis withdrawal a tense exercise in coping with things going astray, while the Soviets need to be poised to make the most of the chaos. This is the good, the bad is that the chit pull does inject fairly serious luck into the game: in general clustered chits for either side is bad for the Axis. 

There is a fair amount of tactical thought required because of the possibility of successive moves by your opponent, but paradoxically those decisions are not that interesting - maybe because they are so ahistorical? Given that, I think the game is too long, as it tends towards the dumb and lucky side. They would be acceptable traits in a 2-3 hour game, but the number of counters and need for tactical precision make it play at least twice as long. 

I can accept that the bloodless CRT saves players from having to continously deal with step replacements, but it does seem to make rivers relatively minor barriers. The supply rules seem a bit weak too as they can lead to Soviet units raiding deep into Axis territory way behind enemy lines with a legal but completely implausible supply route.

Overall a fairly tight and simple game that definitely works, but not top rate.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A surprisingly fun game. I very much enjoyed the subtle differences in the two forces.  The Soviets big and lumbering, with most of their forces unable to move ZOC to ZOC. The Germans small, but potent and very mobile, with the mechanized divisions able to move through two hexes ZOC to ZOC if need be.

The chit pull randomization and the differences between the STAVKA and Manstien chits add to the fun. Rating after only one solo play-through, but I can see this hitting the table often if I can find an interested fellow gamer in Durham, NC (are you out there?).

The rule book sets the standard for hex and counter games, being in color, with many examples, and almost non-existant errata.  Adam did a fantastic job developing this, and is deserving of much praise and whatever tidy sum MMP is paying him.

Keep up the great work Tetsuya, Adam, & MMP!

Got this in a little bit ago, and have played a couple non-solo games.

A very clean 'traditional style' wargame, with promise for lots of tension and several different approaches to take, despite a fixed historical setup. My rating is in flux, but right now, I'm considering it the equal of anything else I've rated a 9.

So far it is holding to its promise of good replayability.

I just ordered this.  I hope my fellow BGGers won't have led me astray on this one...

Seems interesting.  Actually, it seems very retro: old school CRT based on strength ratio (which rewards encirclement tactics), etc. 

I'm playing this right now by email as the Germans and it is TENSE.   I wish I had played it face to face or live because this is drawing the agony out!  Great game, I feel like every counter I move is extremely important.

A victory resoundingly lost! :)

An enjoyable, if somewhat lengthy, introduction to an attempted revamp of old school wargaming that is fun to play solo.

However, I felt no urge to immediately start another session after the Russians achieved a not unexpected sudden victory at the end of turn 7 during my first and only session to-date but am looking forward to getting this game out again sometime in the future, if only out of curiosity to see the effects of alternate strategies. 

I would also be interested to see if playing against an opponent face to face changes the feel of the game but am reluctant to invite anyone to play this game with me given the lengthy downtime.

Good straightforward rule system, interesting asymmetrical situation. Germans need to slowly withdraw, but have occasional strong temptations to attack a weak USSR stack! The chit pull activation, with players choosing which subset of their chits to put in the cup at the start of each turn, works nicely.

Have soloed and played 2-player. Seems to take roughly 6 or 7 hours if it goes the full length (9 turns).

Lives up to high expectations! I initially disliked the colourfull counters, but after playing the game, I must say that it is a) very handy during setup (no endless referencing setuptables!) b) fun to easily measure the progress/retreat of units, as the units' starting postitions are on the map. Gameplay is very smooth, but doesn't feel artificial. The chit-drawing system actually works here and adds to a very tense and exciting game. Now waiting for a chance to play F2F...

As a veteran war gamer the bits and mechanics (hex map and counters, odds ratios and a CRT, ZOCs, two sided counters, step reduction and retreat rules, tracing supply lines, chit activation, etc) were very familiar.

A very smooth, elegant design that is a joy to play.  Don't be fooled by the supply rules--the real supply rules are the communication rules, as pushing headquarters back renders their frontline units inert.  Takes a little too long, but that's the only drawback.

After spending much of the weekend punching and clipping counters, I started playing my first solitaire game. So far it's just great -- a little bit like Go, but with more dramatic and pleasing colors.

There aren't too many components, but their quality is better than expected for the price. As others have pointed out, it takes a steady hand to keep lifting the counter stacks to inspect the map, as the hex grid is tight for the counter size. Still, the "look" of the game on the table is better this way; it shows the congested, serpent-like lines of forces wrestling for control.

Update: It took many weeks to complete an entire game solitaire, playing an hour or two each weekend. The games transforms as the turns progress: the units separate and become limber, strategic movement makes roads more important, supply makes rivers and bridges significant, and new features of the map come to the forefront.

The final turn saw a dramatic collapse for the Axis; three cities fell and almost all of their units were cut off without supply, leading to a victory point avalanche that left me wondering if I should have been checking for sudden death conditions sooner.

It was a wonderful ride, but, seeing that it's out of print, I think it best to set it free for someone else to enjoy, as I don't expect to play it again soon enough.

Both the Soviets and the Germans have a tough time achieving their objectives. Combat generally involves causing step losses through forcing retreats through zones of control.

The Germans only get additional VP for eliminating Soviet mechanised units Since the Soviet player can always control the VP level by protecting their mechanised units, it's up to the German player to hold onto as many victory hexes as possible. If the Soviet player is careless enough, or the German player bold enough, they might be able to scrape together 5 VP worth of Soviet mechanised losses, which is the same value as an entire victory hex. Once Rostov falls, it's the beginning of the end, unless the German player miraculously manages to survive until Turn 9 ends.

The rules are incredibly streamlined and the game is easy to play, yet challenging at the same time. An incredibly fun and competitively balanced game.

An elegant, simple game system (for a war game) that opens up lots of decision-making.  Which chits should Russia choose for  its set?  Go for objectives or attempt to kill units?  How aggressive to be with armor (on offense or defense)?  How to effectively "chain" HQ activation?  Which roads are critical to take?  Should attempt be made to open critical RR?  Whether and when to attempt a breakthrough to opponents supply lines (at possible risk of objectives or one's own supply lines)?  Often, both side of this game can think they are losing, with each having a death grip on the other.  A fun, fun game which seems realistic enough for me.  It can take a LONG time, but I love long games.

After some solitaire play this has become one of my favorite games, and I am not that interested in the Eastern Front. The streamlined rules and color rulebook with examples and illustrations of all the important concepts make play easy. If a stranger knocked on my door and asked me to show them how to play a wargame, I would probably pull A Victory Lost off the shelf.
The situation is also tense--a huge Russian Army prepared to blow a hole in the middle of the German line while the Wermacht attempts to pull back buying time by defending cities and river lines waiting for reinforcements to stream onto the map. I wouldn't change much except I wish the hexes were bigger to accomadate the counter density. The static set-up is also a concern but the chit pull system mitigates this by introducing enough variation and chaos to make each game different. Rating will probably increase with some face-to-face play.

I really wanted to like this game, but I don't.  I think chit-draw mechanics aren't a good way for modern warfare to be modeled.  Given a choice between a CDG where I have some control and some uncertainty, or a chit draw mechanism where I have very little control (Manstein and that's it), or an Igo-Ugo system where I have lots of control and no uncertainty, I think I greatly prefer the first option.Components are functional but unexciting, especially in this era of lavish production quality for many games.And the game is long.  9 turns, with each activation taking 5 minutes on average and a few breaks, gets you well into the 8  hour range.  Once a game reaches the "multiple session" breakpoint, I'd much rather play something that feels more epic than incessantly trying to figure out whether I've got ZOC coverage of railroad lines and how many different chit-pull permutations my current positioning is vulnerable to.

Fine game, would like to get it on the table more than I have.  It's a fine feeling to break out of the defensive lines of the Germans, and see 'nothing but snow...'

This game has neat, simple mechanics, but I think its main strength lies in the strategic situation--a chance for the Soviets to roll over some hapless Axis minors in the opening and then face a big Panzerblitz in the South.  A heck of a lot of fun, and really an old-school feel.

After one play, I am claiming this as one of the best "classic-style" operational- or strategic-level wargame that I have played.  Of course, as somebody who missed the 70s and 80s heyday of the form, that doesn't mean quite as much as it does from the older grognards.  "Classic" means the type of wargame which I rarely play, with zones of control, hexes, terrain effects, combat results table, step losses, and the like.  I do like this game's dynamic of slow retreat, trying to delay the enemy without collapsing, and not retreating too quickly, but not letting the enemy overrun you either.  The game is probably more exciting for the Russian player, as the German has to play a more reactive game, responding to threats and establishing strong points where necessary to try to stem the flow of Russian units.  One thing that takes away from the fun -- it takes quite a while to play.  Our play took about seven hours, and while I see it speeding up, it's always going to take at least the lion's share of an afternoon.

I like what I've seen so far from the International Game Series from MMP [Fire in the Sky, Across Six Bridges].  I look forward to this one as well.

A very elegant design. Fun and fast playing, just the way I like it. Every game ends up different and new strategies are employed as the game progresses.

Simple to learn, hard to master.  Chit pull and repeat activation mechanics keep both side guessing.  Familiar move and fight rules keep you focused on the strategy.  Highly recommended.

Played this 2 times solo, loved it. The chit draw makes it perfect for solo-play. I've always been fascinated by the eastern front, and this game is a perfect game handling Operation Saturn. 

Played it again during Christmas Holidays 2010-2011. Had a blast! The Germans played a pure defending game. The Sovjets couldn't win a single VP city. They destroyed 3 german tanks for 9 points and 5 Infantry's, total of 14 points. The Sovjets should have focussed more in the center and try and take 2 VP cities. Well next time...

A good entry level hardcore wargame (not in the beer & pretzel class).  Good historical options with nice components and great rulebook.  Cudo's to MMP for this one.

The total randomness of HQ activation affects the balance. For example if the Soviets get two activations in a row ( which is totally dependent on players luck ) they may manage to encircle and cut off an entire Axis army. I really don't get that. Also, I'm not in love with the unit graphics.

To use a trite phrase, this is an instant classic.  Standard wargame except for a very good command and control system, which makes it simply great.  Playable in one sitting and full of tough decisions.  Seems pretty balanced so far.  Interesting situation with asymmetrical sides.

A very enjoyable game. Surprisingly simple system offering strategic depth in spite of this simplicity, tension thanks to the chit-pull mechanic, reasonable playing time, works fine solo - what's not to like?

Colourful, easy-reading rulebook.

Play by Vassal.

RATING: 8
Rating after 3 ftf plays, some solo play, and a Vassal game.  The rule set is streamlined and intuitive.  There is very little down time.  The complexity comes from the player interaction and the situation on the board rather than complicated rules.  It might be too long (5 hours for the first game (which ended after 5 turns), 6 hours for the first 5 turns of our second game), but we'll see once we get a few more games under our belts.  The Vassal module is excellent and a great way to play this game via email if you don't have time to complete a game in one sitting.  Well balanced.  Excellent game.

Update:  I've now done three ftf games with the same opponent.  We can't seem to play faster than an hour per turn.  Which means we haven't completed a ftf game yet.  We really enjoyed our Vassal game (played over two months) though.

Update:  I bumped the rating down a point because I can't get the game done in a reasonable amount of time face-to-face.  An excellent game if you have the time.

Good game especially when you are using VASSAL to play.  With VASSAL, you can easily check HQ Command Range, automatically activate units for the chit chosen, and automatically calculate the current VP.  All such tedious jobs are handled and you can focus on the gameplay.

Absence of unnecessary chrome. Simple and perfectly explained rules. Nevertheless, not the "revolutionary system" that the rumour/hype pretends it would be. It's a nice product in terms of playability / accessibility: excellent rules explanation, low counter density, ...  But the game system itself is rather classical.

Es un wargame de reglas sencillísimas, con un manual impecable, con explicaciones clarísimas y multitud de ejemplos gráficos a todo color. Un mapa precioso y counters muy vistosos, con un sistema de activación interesantísimo y que mantiene en tensión a ambos jugadores. Es un juego necesario.

This is a very good game.  Sides are asymmetric, but reasonably balanced.  Simple rules, fast play, tense game, lots of tactics and strategy.

Innovative, and quite conservative at the same time. The chip pull system has been tried before, but seldom with such a good result. As an old grognard there are three rules that really forces you to adjust: 1. The Panzerblitz railways, where it is possible for especially the Russians to blitz through an unguarded railroad all over the map; 2. The command rules, where it is possible to get command through enemy units over an enemy held bridge but not over a major river you own yourselves; 3. Supply rules/victory conditions, where Italians, Rumanians and Hungarians get stranded for up to two months in total isolation without giving up. In addition, a single hole in the line sets them into supply again, even if traced all over the map. Quite odd to say the least. However, despite this, an immensely enjoyable and playable game.

Based on 2 very fun solo plays (about 4 hours each) which produced very different results.  One of the best games I've purchased in years.  Just the right blend of simplicity and elegance, with beautiful components to boot!  Both sides play very differently -- the Soviets massive and inexorable; the Germans quick, deadly and desperate.  I truly hope they apply this system to other battles/campaigns.

One of the few wargames I've actually played to completion a dozen times or more. Brilliant, elegant design that captures this battle better in 10 pages of rules than OCS does in 75.

Love it. Great manual (with only one glitch: HQ relocation). Beautiful map (you DO need a plexiglass sheet; it's paper). Small pieces need some getting used to, but a bigger map isn't possible and bigger hexes would make this a different game.

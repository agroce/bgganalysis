An enjoyable network building game that grows progressively more cut throat with increasing numbers of players.  I really don't mind the roll and move race at the end of the game; the player who builds the shortest route fastest generally wins.

I own the Gold Sieber Linie 1 edition of this game.  The artwork is nothing special, but it's still preferable to the Mayfair edition.

Boy, American board games used to have CHEAP components. I wonder if the tiles in the new printing of this are so damn thin?

In any case, this is a very fun game, lots of blocking and screwage. It's odd; I've played probably the three oldest boardgames in my collection (Manhattan, Settlers, Streetcar) recently. All three still very good games.

A top connection game.  Players initial lay track and then race their trolley through their destination stops.  The first to finish wins.  There is a subtle rules difference between the English and the original game.  In the original players roll a die to move the trolley.  In the English version, movement follows a looping iterations (1 stop, 2 stops, 3 stops, 1 stop, etc) depending on the number of players.  This makes the end game more strategic.  A rarer case where the remake improves the original.  [GTI Code: TPSD]

When it's a choice between Linie 1 (Streetcar) and Metro in our group we tend to settle on Metro. I suspect it's the racing phase in Linie 1 that is putting people off. It makes Metro feel like the more finished game of the two.

p: We owned Linie 1 before we got a copy of Metro, and I enjoyed it from the start. I like the puzzle and blocking element in these track tile-games, and Linie 1 has got that aplenty. The race at the end (sofar) has only been there to confirm that the first finished track also was the first one to carry a tram home, but we always went through the motions of proving it. That phase really lets this great game down. I do like the tile replacement mechanism, where you can add to a track already there. If that elemnt could be combined with the elegance of Metro, you probably have my ideal german train-track-tile game. I can see the temptation for Dorra to tuck on a race on the network created, but the mechanism he came up with adds next to nothing to the game. I accept that it is technically possible to create a more efficient network by building longer and hence win the race, but I yet have to see that happen (yes, I have tried it on several occasions). Leaving the race element out would not significantly alter the majority of games played, but it would strip it down to the strongest part of the game, and shorten gameplay to boot.

But now Metro is sitting right next to it, and it is the latter that sees daylight more often. In Metro I miss the re-routing element, in Linie 1 I miss something too, but I am less clear on what that "woaw" element is.

Maybe it is the length of the route, and the network development that comes with it. I am curious to see how the 4-stop route cards available here work in practise. Maybe next time it will be Linie 1 to come out first, to try this variant.

The score would have been closer to an 8 if the race phase was better or simply not there. With it, it bugs me enough to stop me playing it as often as I did when it was more "unique".

Acquired in The Games People liquidation sale, 80% off the high list price.  Played once each with two, four and five players.  Quite fun to try and make your route through the convoluted mess of tracks that the board will ultimately become.

Some people here complain about the "pointless" race at the end, but it's enough to give players a chance at a comeback if their own routes are better.  In the last game I played, it came down to the race at the end, and when I won (by one turn) I actually threw up my hands and cheered.  How often can you say you actually cheered when you won a game?

Nagyon jó hangulatú játék, ahogy a villamos vonalat össze kell hozni. Rengeteg nevetéssel játszottuk, ahogy egymás vonalait akaratlanul kevertük meg és mire végre sikerült elindulni a villamosnak, mókás pálya alakult ki. Csak ajánlani tudom ezt a játékot,ha agy könnyed kikapcsolódásra vágyunk, de mindenképpen legalább 4 játékossal. A játék atmoszférája az elején olyan gyermeki játékot ad, de aztán bőven megállja a helyét egy jó családi játéknak. Az tetszett főként benne, hogy még a komolyabb játékosok is benézték az útvonalat és úgy indultak el, hogy a villamos nem juthat célba :D

Rating based on one play.  The track-building part would get about a 7.5, and the movement part would get about a 4.5 -- if the player to your right has an inefficient route, there's nothing you can do to overcome this.  Spent an extra turn getting my track all efficient, then was only able to move 2 or 3 spaces each turn because my neighbor had a zillion stops.

Dry puzzle game.  The resulting convoluted track paths are interesting, and it can be rewarding when you finally figure out how to break into existing lines in order to connect your stops, but analysis paralysis drags the game out to an unbearable length.

Difficult to judge for me: Looks like a nice game, but despite the racing element at the end of the game, I do not feel much excitement nor suspense during a game of Linie1.

One of my early euros but somewhat disappointing. Laying a track to disrupt your opponent's plans never seemed to work because they would just place an upgrade over it. The secret route doesn't stay secret for long and it's hard to catch up with an early leader. The new dice are a nice 'push-your-luck' addition to the original game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A light to medium weight game that rewards good planning, but has inadequate room to screw with your competition, mainly because it is nigh impossible to know where they are going and what they need to connect. The idea behind this has some merit, but the actual play is only what I would term decent, the primary problem being that you can't cut off other people's track, and that if two players get reasonably similar routes by the vagueries of the draw, then they will end up inadvertantly helping each other out and get a lead on the others. Luck of the track draw can also be maddening at times, recovering straights off the board is a snap, but hunting for particular speciality pieces that you desperately need can lead to frustration. 

All of that said, this game is very similar to Metro, and given a choice between the two I would take this one in a walk simply because it looks nicer and plays more intuitively. This also is saved from sub-average by the end game race which, though very light and random, makes the game a little more fun too. I really like the graphical design of the board as well...very plain at first, but snazzy once the game is finished.

Production: Tiles are easy to use and look good; the bushes are a simple and aesthetic way to differentiate the locked tiles.  Play: Simple placement system with the added element of secret objectives.  The endgame is an odd clash of simple decisions and mechanical clean-up.  (2+1+3) (1 play)

Everyone&#039;s trying to lay tracks to build a path from one side of the board to the other.  Some screwage as you lay tracks that might divert an opponent to where he doesn&#039;t want to be, but for the most part it&#039;s adapting your plans to the existing track sections each time your turn rolls around.

The initial route-laying phase imbues the 'roll and move' phase with an element of skill - the length of the track being down to the decisions of you and your opponents.

It is a wonderful game for 2-5 players because the goal can scale depending on the number of players. Part puzzle, part route efficiency, part hose-you-neighbor -- this game is tremendous.

Linie 1 hast been a favourite from the start. For a couple of years, I didn't even own a copy myself - had to visit friends to play. At last, I got one as a wedding present.

I do like the mix of strategy and luck. Reminds me of Dampfross. And I love the fact that in this game, you can place tiles that will help you and worry others at the same time (whereas in some games, blocking moves just cost you an action you could have used for your own good).

This is a fun tile laying game, where players are trying to build the shortest routes to their destinations and terminals and then trying to run their streetcar through the route, before your opponents do.

Players can share each others rails and also place rails to disrupt their opponents plans.

The components aren't the greatest, with the tiles being pretty thin and only wooden bloacks with stickers for the rail cars, but they work and seem to hold up pretty well over time.

If your looking for a lighter, rail connection game, give this one a shot. It's a lot of fun, but beware that some players may suffer from AP, trying to think out their moves, as it can get a bit thinky as the game board fills up.

678-this is city planing at it's most fundamental level. Can you design a trolly line so that your citizens can reach their destinations promptly w/o cars and that the city will spend the least money by minimizing total mileage? That is the essence of this puzzle: but you must prove your efficiency w/ a race against your opponents at the end of the game. On the BGG there are many suggestions on improving that race.

We still enjoy this classic.  At its best with 5 or 6 doing 3 stops - I wouldn't play with any less than 5p.  At the start we play a house rule that you can only set one stop per turn, and the first 2p can only play one tile if that is a stop. Use Steetcar rules for racing

RATING: 8
Great connection game with hidden information.  You want others to build for you, but they might (literally, yet unwittingly) turn against you!  The die rolling at the end allows late completions to still contend for the win if they have managed to build an efficient route.  I rather like that last little bit of excitement.  Once your car is racing along, there almost never any decisions left to make, but your previous decisions factor largely on the outcome.

I [b]had[/b] to have the original Goldsieber version.  I love the whimsical art so much more than the hideous Mayfair version.

A good game, although a strange one.  Strange both in the odd jockeying for station placements and in the endgame race, which doesn't feel quite right in either the German (Linie 1) or the English (Streetcar) rules.  It's good for an occasional play, but overall the same itch is better scratched by games like Fresh Fish, Dampfross, Ticket to Ride, Tsuro, TransAmerica, and even Ta Yü.

Somewhat interesting game of tile placement and route connecting, but lacks enough qualities to make it special. Each player is given a secret car and secret set of destinations to connect. After placing track tiles to create the route, the player must actually travel the route to win. This allows a bit of catching up by other players if they manage to make a more efficient route, but it isn't that big of a factor. Overall, I'd be much more inclined to play Metro.

I think I like this one more than Metro, and that's saying a lot for me. The elements of this one make it more challenging and ultimately more satisfying than Metro. You can get into trouble if you can't seem to draw the right tiles in this one as well, but it feels like there is more that you can do about it in Linie 1 that you can in Metro.

This is a fun little game, with a nice puzzle aspect.  It is fun to try to use your opponent's tracks for your own.  

The endgame gets a little long, with the "race" aspect having less of an impact than you would imagine.  The first player out usually wins...  This maybe begs for a modification, like holding at a stop until another player starts to race.  

The graphics are usable, but not excellent.  The cars themselves are a little of a letdown, and should be a bit higher production.  In all, I prefer other race games for racing (Mississippi Queen, or Formula De) and other puzzle games for the tile play (Entdecker, Carcassonne).

First played this on April 12th, 2007.  This is a quick learn and farily quick play.  We played it as a two player game and it may play better with more since your opponent(s) would have to focus on trying to figure out where multiple people were going.  I enjoyed it, however it seemed a bit clunky for me as well.  It has a bit of the get your neighbor touch as you can lay down tiles that can mess with your opponents.  I'd recommend giving this a game play, however you will probably stop there.

More fun than I expected. A simple game of spatial dynamics, Linie 1 feels like a precursor to joint-route building spatial puzzle games wherein players are free to build networks used by everyone throughout the game. Chaotic and challenging, Linie 1 forces players to mitigate the track laying of others through optimal tile placement of their own. 

A nice game even if it isn't as interesting as heavier fare like Cavum.

Linie 1 consists of two parts. In the first part, players can lay two tiles each turn until they have connected the two ends of their line with two or three intermediate stations, depending on the number of players. Lines and intermediate spots are secret. Once a player has completed his track, he reveals his route. From thereon, it's a simple roll-and-move game to complete the assigned route first.

Linie 1 takes the structure introduced by Dampfross and brings it into an easier quicker form more appropriate for the amount of luck in the race. A good family game, still fun 20 years after its release when played casually.

Not as bad of a game as I anticipated.  In general I don't really like tile-laying games, but here it moved quickly enough and was not as convoluted as Metro.  The game is laid back and somewhat pleasant, but lacks excitement or a hook to draw you in.  Mayfair did an awful job with the graphic design.  When seeing this game and the components, I thought back to all the games whose art was reworked by Mayfair - Settlers, Tigris & Euphrates, Manhattan - it is all really ugly and represents a total waste of money.  Just keep the original artwork!

Manchmal nutzt aber auch das Auswechseln der Karten nichts. Dann geht es nur auf Umwegen zum Ziel. 
Jetzt kann die Einweihungsfahrt beginnen. An einer Endhaltestelle wird die Straßenbahn eingesetzt - und würfeln. Nur eine Eins... Es hätte doch auch das Haltestellensymbol auf dem Würfel sein können.

Couldn't quite decide if it was slightly better or slightly worst than Transamerica. There is no control whatsoever about the path your metro will take, and the game takes forever to complete.

It's a tile-laying connection game with a race.  Players are given a card (with 2 destination sites (kept secret).  They then lay tiles to connect from their trolley terminal to each of the sites.  Once one is satisfied with the route they place their trolley card and move it (based on movement rules) until they have stopped at each of their destination and returned back to one of their 2 trolley terminals.  Players can defensively place tiles (screw opponents) and bluff (to throw others off).  I'd play this over TransAmerica anyday.

Played the Mayfair version, once. Not much to it apart from you guessing your opponents' start and end, by inferring it from the track they need to place to avoid having a complicated route, but you then just mess it up anyway with a strategicall placed bend. Players will be frustrated by the lack of useful tile draws. Might appeal to your little child inside whom loves setting up toy train set. The final streetcar "race" is pointless and detracts from the game, acting as a kind of victory lap for the person who is the obvious winner anyway. Will play just about any other train game instead of this one.

RATING: 6
Solid gameplay but I don't seem to enjoy playing that much. Phase 2 where you ride with your streetcar through your route is a fun idea, but doesn't work that well actually. At least if played with "you can move one more than previous player" -system that takes away the (certain) luck from it. When played with a die then of course you can get a (un)lucky. Clever route building helps naturally there too.

It's a downtime-prone analytical affair getting your track laid, where the game-ending race can be more of a coup-de-grace rather than a heart-racing climax depending on how things went. It plays surprisingly well as a 2 player game. Doesn't get called for much when we have more players, despite it being solid.

Streetcar: Interesting tile-laying game that requires good visualization of the development of the routes, in building your own, utilizing other player's tiles, and hindering the other's plans. This isn't too difficult most of the time. The lack of contiguous building seems odd but a allows for deception as well as route protection. Not really sure if I like the 'inaugural run' endgame mechanic but it isn't too onerous. Just barely making an 8.

A great track laying game. You are trying to build your track while making use of what others are building as well. While you can play deliberately to mess up another player, I find that trying to complete your track generally messes things up enough for the others sufficiently.
The race only confirms how efficient your track was.

Disclaimer: I LOVE train and connection games.

Pros: There are not that many connection or train games where you can place track [b]anywhere[/b]. Most train games restrict you to extend train lines.

Cons:
* The tiles are horribly too thin. But the game itself is older than ten years, presumably before we all got spoiled by Carcassone-thick tiles.
* Theming is somewhat problematic: It's definitely a train game, but I do not feel at all in New Orleans. The game is played on a symmetric, square grid. Any attempt at asymmetry and thereby make the board look like an actual map would probably unbalance and break the game.

Perceived cons:
* The race at the end of the game is fun! Think of it as an interactive scoring mechanism. Just Compare the time it takes to complete the scoring in a more recent Euro game, such as Goa, with Streetcar -- I'd rather take Streetcar. 
* Yes, there will be a chance when you'll make useless plays because you're waiting for that one tile. I believe, though, that it's your fault if you ended up in that situation because there is a lot of room for planning ahead in this game.

Comparisons:
* With metro: Metro doesn't have have much strategic depth or planning; it's a tactical game with really only two choices: Do I screw over my opponent or improve my situation, and it's typically the first choice. (You could take into account the probability of getting a particular tile, but the board is such a visual mess that you're probably not paying attention to that).
* With TransAmerica: TransAmerica is the more elegant game, and you get to play on a board that looks like a map, but there is no opportunity at all to screw over opponents. With TransAmerica, you basically play the same game over and over until a specified score. I personally find that tedious.

Un gioco molto sottovalutato che considero molto ben fatto. Anche se è presente la fortuna nella pesca e nel dado, dalle partite fatte ho sempre notato che la vittoria finale è sempre giocata sul filo di lana. Bisogna saper sfruttare bene i percorsi degli altri e ridurre il più possibile le fermate che dovete fare altrimenti non riuscirete a vincere. Questo è un punto a favore che nobilità la strategia del gioco e mantiene vivo il divertimento fino all'ultimo. Inoltre è semplice e divertente, non è mai noioso ed è bello vedere come sono venute le ferrovie che avete costruito. Infine Linie 1 della Goldsieber Spiele, rispetto a prodotti più moderni, la grafica può sembrare scarna ma nel 1995 era il massimo!

RATING: 8
A lovely mix between a network tile-laying game and a race.  The mechanism of improving the route by trading up for a more complex tile is clever.  There's good interaction as you try to make your route efficient and your opponent's circuitous, while having to guess what their routes actually are meant to be.  The mechanics for the race element are also fun.  The only thing that lets down the game is the poor quality of the thin card tiles, which is a huge shame, as they're the main components of the game.

Discovered during our last session that we'd been playing the tile replacement rule incorrectly.  We had previously only required replacement tiles to connect to all exits, but not necessarily support the existing path.  This led to a much more tense game, requiring players to build redundancies into their routes in anticipation of opponents realigning crucial links.  Frankly I liked our variant better; the rating is for the rules as written (as Streetcar).

A játék kivitelezése igazi igénytelenséget mutat. Vékony lapkák, csúnya grafika, idétlen komponensek. Ha az ember túl tudja tenni magát ezen az anomálián, akkor egy nagyon szórakoztató játékkal tud megismerkedni. A szépsége az, hogy ki lehet szúrni a másikkal, de nem annyira, hogy végképp lehetetlenné tegyed neki a további játékot, azaz van korrekcióra lehetőség. A már megépített vonalat felül lehet építeni, de csak úgy, hogy bővíti az ember az útvonalat, nem lehet megszüntetni az eredeti vonalakból. Eddig a pontig elvileg titkosan kezelik a játékosok, hogy melyik színű villamossal és milyen útvonalra tervezik a járatot. Miután a játékos úgy látja, hogy sikerült a feladatnak megfelelően kialakítani a járatot, egy újabb játék indul el.A villamosok elindulnak a megépített útvonalakon. Itt lehet taktikázni a sebességekkel, mert ezek kihatnak a többi járgányra is. Nekem nagyon tetszett a játék.

This was an interesting little connection game that bears some similarity to Metro.  In both, you are laying tile s that represent track in order to connect stations.  In this one, however, there seems to be less potential for outright screwage as you are able to "upgrade" track that might cause you trouble.  In addition, once you lay part of your track, the resulting connections can never be undone.  This seems to reduce the outright chaos a fair amount.  Despite this, there is still plenty of room for interaction and interference.  A lot of fun.  I think I am going to have to track down the German edition as the paper tiles in the Mayfair edition really get on my nerves.

RATING: 5
In Streetcar, players build a route from one point to another using tiles, with the catch that their route has to pass through destinations which are kept secret from all other players. Players then have to run their streetcar through their completed route, and the first to reach the other end wins. 

Having played this exclusively as a two-player game only, Streetcar can be best described as decent but uneventful. The secret destinations are a nice touch to the usual route-building gameplay, but I don't care much for the pseudo-race at the end as you can already tell who has the most efficient route anyway. The tiles in the Mayfair edition are so thin that they successfully distract from the dated-looking graphics. I purchased this at a deeply discounted price to add a route-building game to my collection, but sold it off a year later when I realised it would probably never be played again.

Very mellow track laying game.  There is a little bit of screwage, but for the most part you try to complete your puzzle.  I prefer the Mayfair speed rules over the original dice rules.  Where the Mayfair version fails is in the poor production.  

Still, it is a solid system with just enough angst and passive aggressiveness to keep you engaged until the end.  A nice light 'tweener game.

A much brainier and more enjoyable version of Metro.  This is a wonderful tile placement and connections game that is full of great strategy.  While you are a bit limited by the tiles you select, part of the joy is making the most of them, and it's really entertaining to shorten your route and connect the stations.  The endgame is quite satisfying, as you actually attempt to complete a run on the line you've just created.  Likely will move up to a 9, but I'd like to get in another play or two.

Wow, good game, but a tad hard on players' first game--which was the case for us, this was new to all of us (and not coincidentally, another notch out of my unplayed games list).  Mistakes on our parts led to problems getting a correct path linked at the end, which led to a bit of a runaway leader problem.  But it's not a problem inherent in the game exactly since there were obvious misplays which were all too clear at the end!  It'll definitely come out again because it plays in a near perfect single-lunch-time-slot.

RATING: 6
Each player is secretly dealt cards showing the two terminals they must travel their streetcar between and the two stops they must visit along the way. Turns in the first part of the game consist of placing track tiles, either for personal advantage or opponent disadvantage; once a player's route is complete they move their streetcar.

This second part of the game seems to be different across versions (the Goldsieber editions include dice, the Mayfair one just lets a player move one more than the previous mover), but in either case is weak and uninteresting, with minimal decisions. The early part of the game, trying to build useful track without giving away your number and destinations, is charming.  Track can be upgraded in place if existing connections are left, 18XX-style, with the corollary that some advanced track types can [i]not[/i] be upgraded -- it's quite easy to hurt another player with one.

There's probably a tad too much luck in the tile draw, but it could still be a classic if not for the whimpering conclusion. The Mayfair version has typically poor production values so I wouldn't even consider getting a copy.

Game where players first construct streetcar lines connecting stations and then race to be the first to navigate their particular routes. I'm not completely fond of the mechanic that limits the speed of the streetcars. It's intended to give people who are behind a chance to catch up but what it really means is that whether or not you can win depends entirely too much on the person seated to your immediate right. But in spite of that, it's an enjoyable game.

I'm not entirely sure exactly where the game is here... Lay tiles or replace tiles, but you can never remove an existing route so you can't directly 'attack' another player. It then becomes just an efficiency race... which wasn't deeply interesting. There is some game in choosing how far to travel to then limit how far the next player can travel. Alas, in our game it only resulted in king-making.

I'm sure there is more here, but nothing motivates me to go in search of it.

Tile laying part is fun, but the movement of cars is a let down after the fun of tile laying.

Nice game.  It might be the meatier than Metro game I have been looking for.  I certainly like it more than Aqua Romana, but I was really mister A.P. during this game.  My route was messed up first by a mistake on my part, and then by the actions of others.  For several turns I made new plans and then had to totally re-think them a turn or two later.  I don't think I will be as slow next time, though.

An interesting game that we have stopped playing because of differing opinions about the way the game ends. No one is happy with the rules at the end because we have had several instances where a player that is far behind ends up in a position where their move will determine who wins the game. We have each proposed several altermate endings but we cannot agree so the game does not get played anymore.

A light and quick track building game. It gets more interesting with more people, and can play as nice or as mean as you want. I am undecided over the die-rolling for the race resolution.

I will admit that this game has a three large problems.  The first is that it can be extremely unfair.  Some routes are much harder than others.  The second complaint is that the two "halves" of the game don't meld as well as you may like.  It definitely feels like 2 games pasted together.  The last problem is that some players are just never going to be as good as others at it.  It requires a certain amount of visual strategy, and not everyone has it.  A brand new player is definitely at a disadvantage with experienced players.

Even with those two problems, I absolutely love this game.  The puzzle aspect of it is fantastic, as is the player interaction (which is often cutthroat).  I will probably play this many times, as long as my friends are willing to play with me.

Quite okay tile-laying game. It just isn't tight enough.

-Missing 1 tile. Condition: Very worn but playable.

Reprint of Linie 1, though with the original, better IMHO game end movement rules the first publisher had done away with. Fun game. Can be a "take that" game, except that, if you do want to play that way, you have to puzzle out what will actually hurt your opponents so that you don't accidentally help them instead.

I didn't take to the idea of making the longest route possible nor the open tile laying mechanism that felt a bit too wide open and ended up with people blocking themselves.

Nice tile-laying game about contructing streetcar lines with a racing element at the end of the game that works like a timer for the other players to get going. We play the German first print Goldsieber edition with the die-rolling variant for the racing part. We believe that this is actually the best variant for the endgame as it encourages you to build the most efficient route for your line and puts some randomness into the racing part so other players can not predict your move excatly. Otherwise the endgame can get quite tedious and nasty at the same time.

The rules are very easy to learn as they seem self-evident but the game can get quite thinky and difficult because of the hidden information about the other players' lines. The German first edition in our opinion uses the best illustration of all versions but the track tiles itself seem a bit bland. We also wonder why the industrial area (with 'Ickea' – hilarious) is located just in the center of the city. That seems unrealistic to us and we would have liked to exchange it for the fish market. This game may not have attracted the attention it deserved because of all the Settlers of Catan hype in the 90s. Fortunately, it got re-released some years ago by Goldsieber. It is an easy to learn yet fun to play and quite thematic family game.

The quality of the pieces is not so great (New Orleans version).  Track laying kind of interesting but end game of running the trolley kind of tedious.

One of the longest-lived games in my collection, I got it (the German "Linie 1") version as a teenager, and still play it now, 15 years later.

Some people have trouble with the rule re: "upgrading" tiles on the board, but other than that, the rules are pretty straightforward.

I find it most interesting when played with fewer players, as having three buildings, rather than only two, makes the routes more convoluted, which is most of the fun.

If I were to rate the tile-laying portion of Streetcar only, I'd give it a 7.5 or 8.  The claiming of routes, trying to be efficient as well as to undo the damage your opponents have inadvertently caused, was both frustrating and exhilirating, especially when you finally find a solution to what seemed like a hopeless cause earlier.  The mechanic was reminiscent of both Ticket to Ride and the 18xx series.  However, the actual running of the streetcar was where the game failed for me.  Although the movement rules were not overly complicated, it was certainly a chore to keep track of, and was just completely devoid of fun.

I think this is the first game ever I wouldn't want to play the "full" experience.  Only the first half for me, thank you very much.

This expansion for RDI comes with another 4 new adventurers and their decks, and this time they've actually each got a unique mechanic (with varying degrees of uniqueness and fun) that is important to the character, as opposed to just a slightly different assortment of fight/heal/gamble.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
More RDI. Slightly more complicated characters. Take that as you will.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2.5
Not so much a game as a pile of cards. Draw some random unbalanced stuff, throw it at each other until everyone else passes out drunk. The theme is kind of fun, but there is zero strategy or higher brain function, the art is lazy, and the gambling sub-game is unsatisfying and takes up too much space.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
By far my favorite RDI expansion.  Very flavorful characters, and the tinkerer is my favorite of the lot.  YMMV, though, if you don't like randomness (and if this is you, you probably shouldn't play RDI to begin with).

Each RDI3 character comes with a special mechanic; either a  new deck (Gear, Wulfric, Potion) or Serena's Piety system. They work, but I'm not overly keen on them; in particular, Wulfric and Wizgille's Gear deck can often end up hurting them instead of helping them. But hey, if you don't want to roll those dice, don't play those characters.

I really enjoyed this game while when I played it at the booth Gen Con 2013. Then I tried to play a 4 player game with just this set. The paladin demolished everyone. We played it again, switching up who we were playing as, to no avail. The paladin smashed everyone again. We played again. This time every other player went after the paladin. The paladin didn't win. But every other player had to pile on her. When I brought this up to the people at the booth, they told me that we were just not playing ALL of the other characters right. That was the answer. Not that the character is overpowered, that ALL of us were just playing our characters wrong. I really enjoy the game's premise, the mechanics, but I hate the paladin and I hate the Slugfest people's response.

Really based on take-that, and lots of luck. Theme is fun: I could maybe enjoy this playing with friends and lots of alcohol. Although there are lots of other games that would fit this bill as well (Sheriff of Nottingham would be way better).  Plus, only 3 players and it still took an hour: way too long for what it is.

3 could stand alone... but it probably shouldn't. I don't think you'd want more than half the players using these characters. They are significantly more complicated, which can make the game more complex in a nice way.

New characters are exceedingly gimmicky.

After a second play I have to conclude that RDI3 is considerably weaker than the first two in the series.  The gnomish inventor particularly seems predisposed to self-harm.  Despite surviving for fairly long, I don't see much potential for that character.  I'm not surprised that the best character seems to be the Paladin, because it's also the simplest and least gimmicky.  The wolf pet isn't as bad as the inventor but still has a tendency to provide far too random effects.

RATING: N/A
A cutthroat game of drinking and gambling. Get your comrades drunk and swindle them out of their money before you pass out in a drunken stupor. This game is a light and quick card game where players try to get each other drunk. Great to play as a real drinking game but not the best game if you aren't drinking. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
These new characters up the craziness/luck factor even further than before...but then, RDI never did involve much strategy in the first place. I'm not personally sold on Phrenk (why can't you actually get players bidding for your items?), but the other three are great. They all feel quite different from the characters in previous games, too - if you already have the original, I'd recommend skipping 2 and going straight to 3 for the additional variety.

I'm honestly a little bothered about playing a game that is just about drinking, gambling, and fighting, because I don't partake in any of that IRL.  That being said, I did enjoy the game.  I really liked how each character had their own mechanic, which means that every one plays differently.  That can keep the game from growing old.

This 3rd expansion introduces 4 new heroes (3 with their own side companion decks, and the fourth with a Piety board) enabling a potential 12 players to the game! Because the companion deck can be helpful, harmful, or neutral it must balance the heroes out when playing with the earlier heroes(?) The box says they can be combined but there are no instructions about whether the companion decks are also included.  We played with just the 3rd expansion, so haven't played it yet with more than 4 players or mixed in other heroes.

The companion decks are very unique--one is mechanical gears, another based on a pet dog, another has potions.

It's intriguing and we are looking forward to seeing how it plays with 5 to 12 people.

RATING: 2
The beginning of every turn permits players to discard any number of cards and then draw up to a hand-size, so rather than figuring out what your cards do (since every card contains a paragraph of text at minimum) and deciding what you're going to do come your turn and simply evaluating based upon relative gold\fortitude\drunkenness\drink advantages, players spend the first four to seven seconds of every turn silently reading text.

Then you play a fairly dumb take-that card game between all that boring reading.

Not my favorite expansion. Each of these characters comes with an additional, game-halting mechanic that not only slows the game to a crawl, but often creates cheep-shot interactions that either don't work with other characters, or end up being harmful to no one but you, and where is the fun in that? The only one I like is the troll brewmaster Phrenk. He creates potions and items with his cards, and essentially becomes a merchant in the game. I think it might have been better if he had become part of the environment of the Inn instead of an actual player, like the tavern Wench. Most of our group considers him to be over-powered, and they frequently attempt to take him out of the game early on for that very reason.

Red Dragon Inn is a lot of fun to play.  I even like it with big groups, the only problem is that when you play with a big group if someone has analysis paralysis you are hosed and the game will take forever.  You really need to keep this game moving and it will be fun, but if people are slow the game will be painful.

RDI 3 adds some very new and quirky mechanics to the game.  Some are based on luck.  Some are based on intense strategy, and in one case, it's based on your social charisma!  A very nice addition to your RDI collection, though I don't recommend this as your first RDI purchase.

My son sure likes this..  I'm OK with it, but it's a bit more luck-based than anything else. That reduces the rating a bit.  But if you can role-play the cards as you're laying them down, it can be good..  The key is who you play with, I guess.

RATING: 5
this is an omnibus rating based on a single play combining 1-4.

suffers from the same issue as Alien Frontiers, which is that you can't pre-act before your turn -- you must draw your hand (potentially 7 new cards), grok each drawn card -- both text and context -- and then decide what to play, all while everyone else is simply waiting for you to go. Problem is, this is a social game with a role-playing element, and thus thrives with greater numbers. Leading to: diminishing returns as the game goes/drags on, leading to: being eliminated becomes a more lovely & anticipated prospect over time.

My gateway game. Played games once a week @ work but owned none...till I found RDI demoing at PAX East.  Immediately bought all 3 editions plus the 2 expansion characters, and kicked in for the full Kickstarter for RDI 4 + expansion characters.  The learning curve is simple, drawing in even non-gamer gamers, the rules are fleshed out, there's plenty of game balance, the cards are funny and well drawn, and it makes for a fantastic warm-up or party game.  Easily my favourite game so far.

Excellent game mechanics keep people involved even in larger games. Theme allows for light in character moments. Mix and matchable with all versions makes it great value, though the older characters coud use some boosting to be more unique.

I switched to metal dubloons which makes hoarding gold much more enjoyable. 

House-rule finished beer bottlecaps are good for one coin.

I was able to make tuckboxes and condense all 3 games, the new and old coins into the original box. This makes it much more transportable.

Theme – 5/5. Can’t give anything but a five for a set that includes a fairy, a wolf, a gnome tinkerer and a potion making troll. Not a huge fan of the orc paladin, but in the end? Awesome.

Complexity – 4/5. This expansion adds a level of complexity to the game that I don’t normally notice in RDI games. Each of the characters have their own side thing to keep track of, which can get really cumbersome after a few real life drinks. They’re fun, but I feel like they almost detract from how simply complex and random the original game was.

Length – 4/5. Game can go long or short depending on amount of players and just how lucky or unlucky you are. Not a bad thing.

Fun – 5/5. Definition of fun really. It’s funny, it’s fun to sit around and talk with friends, it’s overall just a fun game and this expansion doesn’t really detract from it. 

Replay-ability – 4/5. You end up seeing the same cards over and over, but…. Well that’s not a bad thing. The theme of the game itself helps the expansion, especially with its added randomness, be different enough to play again.

Production Value – 5/5. Cards are well made, the art is well done, and there isn’t a whole lot I can say. 

4.5/5. Great game and while this expansion kind of does put a slight damper on it by added things that I feel, while amazingly fun, are a bit more complex than the rest of the game… it is not detracting from the game by existing.

Bonus: Customization – 0/5. Really nothing that can be added to this game, which is unfortunate. 

I don't.... own this anymore unfortunately. Which sucks. I had to give it to a friend and he has yet to buy me my own copy for the trade.

RDI3 is a good expansion for someone who already has several other of the RDI games, but it wouldn't be a good starting place. Out of the four characters in this game, 3 have two decks, and the last has a complex morality scale.

A game that focuses on all the fun stuff that adventurers do after they're done in the dungeon.

This third set is standalone or can be mixed with the adventurers in the original set, but as each of the characters here has a second deck of cards or a secondary stat to track I suggest starting with Red Dragon Inn or Red Dragon Inn 2 first.

Admittedly I found the new twists to the characters to be quite welcome and add alot of unique seasoning to the game.  We played with Wizgille, Phrenk and Serena (which means I've yet to see Kaylin in action.) These new characters made me retroactively wish they had been more exploratory with the second one.  It carries the same gameplay as the first and second game, so theres no real surprises there.  The drink deck is mostly more of the same with a few unique beverages and drink events, all of which are welcome additions to the series.  Phrenks potion deck was a solid addition, allowing you to exchange gold for a 8th card (that is public knowledge) essentially, which is solidly balanced as its entirely optional.  Wizgilles Gizmo deck supplements her cards with unexpected mechanical flubs mostly in her favor but a few involve critical risks, meaning theres an enjoyable in theme chaotic element to some of her cards.  Serena's piety is also an enjoyable system involving calculated risks and decisions.  None of this makes what is a simple game to start with anymore complex, (it's still light fair) but rather it supplements the game with more theme and spice making it quite the welcome addition to a rather accessible game to play over a few beers.  The only regret I have is that while I don't feel this needs another in the series I now kind of want one.  I'd honestly like to see a 4th addon to this title that actually gives the first 8 characters unique attributes in a similar vein to this title.  Things like a Pookie deck for Zot would be most welcome.

New Characters are really more complex, though. Not a bad thing!

Really enjoy all the RDI games, but you must be in the mood - it's pretty random, good as a wind down game.

Finally picked it up for some variety. This is by far the most requested game I have among non-gamers. I stopped logging plays even. I'll play it until it falls apart, but probably won't replace it. I just want to play other stuff! :p

This is probably one of my favorite games on this site.  Whether you're playing a simple 3-4 player game or a frantic 10+ player game (I can't wait to try a 14 player game with the new expansions!), it's great fun.

This is one of those games that really has it all-- simple mechanics, incredibly balanced, great player interaction, always interesting, and always fun.  It's actually amazing that the game is now up to 14 characters and no one character feels stronger than the other (well, except for maybe Eve...).

This is one of those games I am always up to play with friends and it just never really gets old because there are so many different characters to play that all feel different.  If I had to pick a favorite expansion, it would probably be Red Dragon Inn 2 for Dimli and Gog, but they're all worth it.

By far the worst game we've purchased.  Someone at a game store saw us looking at it and said it was a fun game - should have waited to buy until we watched some videos.  Production quality is terrible.  The backs of cards are very plain with simple art and text.  The fronts of them are not much better.  For a game that relies almost entirely on cards, the cards should be of a higher quality with more captivating art.

The game itself is just not fun.  It's a luck of the draw game where play gets downright monotonous.  Draw, draw, draw.  It might be fun to play as a party game with a large group of people, but is still not something we'd enjoy.  (Maybe play instead so YOU take a drink every time ____ happens?)  The gambling game-within-the-game is confusing, at best, and the whole concept of trying not to get so drunk you pass out wasn't as humorous as it was stupid.  (We don't mind humor, but this just didn't feel funny.)  Also, I would rate this game 18+ or 21+.

Selling.

Very similar to the original game, but with some added little twists that add some additional silliness and a welcome increase in strategy, however slight.

It's a fun game for kicking back and drinking with friends when you still want to have conversation.

Egy elég egyszerű kártyajáték, ahol egy kalandozó csapat tagjai egymás próbálják az asztal alá inni, közben a nehezen "összekaszabolt" aranyakat mindenféle szerencsejátékra és a csinos pincérlányra herdálva. Célunk, hogy mindenféle trükkös lapokkal vagy elszedjük mindenki pénzét, vagy eszméletünknél maradjunk, mire a többiek kifekszenek a lőrétől.
Munchkin szerű, néhol kicsit vontatott a játékmenet, de mivel sok lap minden karakter paklijában előfordul (de az egyes szereplők mégis egész más játékstílust igényelnek), a második játék már pörgősebb.

These characters offer additional game mechanics into the mix.  Best not used by first-time players but other than that same comment as the first RDI.

The extra mechanics to the characters don't really add anything to the game.
Serena is also overpowered and causes game unbalance.

Good solid expansion, except the new drink deck cards are larger than the cards from the previous two expansions so they can't be shuffled together. So half the reason for buying the expansion goes right out the window.

This game is always fun with any group of people, and with so many characters that somehow all feel really balanced and yet different, it does not get boring fast, and so far, not at all.

Seems like basically the same thing as the first RDI, except some characters have special rules they have to work with. Pretty enjoyable when you're in worse condtion than the characters.

Love this game.  Best played as a drinking game.  Would give this a 9 or 10 if it weren't for the fact that when players pass out or run out of gold, they're out of the game.  I like games that keep all players in the game until the end.

I like RDI3, its very fun and funny. I'll need to eventually pick up the other two games in the series to give my play group more character options. But since this hasn't been hitting the table very much, its not an immediate purchase so far.

*Also Own - Red Dragon Inn, Red Dragon Inn 2, and Red Dragon 4.

Pooky, Erin and RDI3 all have extra mechanics that make RDI1 & 2 a little less fun and maybe a bit under powered.

RATING: 10
The best Red Dragon Inn! In my opinion, this is the game everyone should start with (if you can handle the secondary decks - otherwise RDI2 would be ideal for a simpler game). Phrenk and Serena are two of the best characters in the entire series, and actually all of the characters here are solid and fun. They all have really cool mechanics via their secondary decks that are vastly different from each other yet no one feels over or under-powered.

The final of the bunch, and the best to date with the new rule quirks.

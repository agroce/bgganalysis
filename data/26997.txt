An offshoot/evolution of Twilight Struggle, the overarching thing I find is that this is like a TS taken to 11; the highs are higher, the lows more destitute, and the game is much more asymmetrical in strategy than TS is. The tension remains (and in some ways, is amplified). Of the differences, two of the biggest are the support check "super-coup" setup and the power struggle scoring. I find the power struggle to be sort of bolted on at times; I get the potential, and in practice when both players control a handful of locations in a country, it works (and plays out very similar to a short game of Red7). It's not a mechanic that is representative of the time so much as a mechanical aspect that evokes an emotion of the time (key nuance I see lots of people miss). What it also does is create a series of incentives to break control just as much as control less attractive spots. The downside to this is when you are in a country where you don't control something/much/etc and a scoring card comes out to make a routing and it's just this time consumption... Both players seem to need about 10+ cards in the PS hand to make it interesting and when you get that, it's a really nice effect but it's never a given... The second difference being the support check bit which I think is straight up allsum in terms of power; you're given this powerful toy (2 in a single card) without a defcon restriction and some reason to control adjacent spaces (for the realignment-like bonus). The flip side is that the average space in 1989 is just over a half point higher in stability than in TS (approximately 3 vs a little under 2.5), so while there are still 1 point spots (the student spaces), lots of things you want to take over are 3, 4, or 5 point spaces which is really tough to do so that decision of whether to use a card for ops/event/checks is rather interesting, in some ways, more so than in TS where I find things to be a little more scripted by existing meta and analysis. 

I actually find the lack of a defcon coupled with the potential return of scoring cards to be an interesting mix. I think the potential for the game space to play out differently each time is greater than in TS because it's open season on the board and some areas will naturally have a focus in the second half of the game after some regions are removed. Which regions and what cards that affect those regions that are still in the deck is a big part of that (and something you have some influence over). On that note, you can't just let go of a region as the Democrats (but that's a solid part of the strategy as the Communists); have to aggressively contest everything as you might get into a real pinch for points if you're not careful (more so than at TS where you can sort of abandon a region and make it up elsewhere). As such, I find is that 1989 is more emergent courtesy of that elimination of scoring potential; sometimes I'm less interested in what cards I'm messing with and more intrigued with the board management (ala 1960's board management, compared to TS where it's a solid hand management exercise). In TS, you are happy to play your opponent's events because you can mitigate them and play them when it's not conductive for your opponent. I don't find that focus holds in 1989; I'm still interested in proper timing, but I'm less interested in eliminating their cards (which are often tied to a region that may not even be in the deck anymore) so much as I want to escape them (e.g. Monday Demonstrations). Playing my own; I don't know that those regions will still be in play, so would I rather fire it now or keep it in the deck (where as in TS, that's easier to decide upon). To this degree, it's less hand/deck management, more deck thinning and board management compared to TS.

Thematically, I've studied this time period, and the mechanical attributes are spot on in creating that uncertainty. While I do find there is more dice rolling in 1989, it doesn't bother me given that context, and overall, I find 1989 to shine brighter than TS in every way (except thematically which I find the abstracted Cold War to be precisely what I want), especially in the area of an evolving game space.  In many ways, I think it's the pinnacle of Matthew's designs. It's a smoother game and it has a bigger butterfly effect compared to TS (which seems to lock down into more of a pattern each time given the operational efficiency angle that TS's card values translate to). Thematically though, I find it less gripping than TS (similar to WSDV), but I'm at a loss to explain why. Maybe that changes over with time or becoming deeply involved with learning the cards, maybe it's a taste preference. Either way, a very enjoyable experience and rivals Twilight Struggle.

edit: still rated a 9 after about 10 plays. In short, it's my favorite of the three Matthews Cold War titles. I find the overall strategy and tactical decisions to be more interesting, nuanced, and nail biting than in Twilight Struggle. The theme, while well integrated, doesn't resonate quite as loudly as TS. I don't think because you like one, you'll like the other though, the focus change from hand/deck management to more board/deck management and a more asymmetrical game can rub people the wrong way.

If you like Twilight Struggle you will have no problem enjoying 1989.  The spiritual successor to one of the most popular games on BGG does not disappoint and I really enjoy the Hannibal-esque power battle with the cards before each scoring round.  I find myself wanting to play this more than Twilight Struggle, not sure if that is because it's new or because I like it more.  Time will tell.

High grades for the components and the history/research but this is still a pale imitation of the much superior Twilight Struggle. 
The absolutely awful Power Struggle ruins it for me. I quickly dreaded having to stop the game to do it.
And that's the main rub. The game comes to a screeching halt.

Yet to play but hope to remedy soon - taken the Twilight Struggle and tweaked it to a fascinating eraof European history that I can remember very vividly on a personal level. Some almost tactical elements added in the form of strikes, protests and managing them. GMT keeps up the fine productions standards of recent efforts.

I love the system, this could go up as I familiarize with the cards, but to be honest that's also what holds it back a bit - I have to be in the mood for a game that rewards deck fore-knowledge and the imbalance that can create if you're teaching someone (or being taught).

 Excelente juego. Tiene las mismas mecánicas que el Twilight Struggle, pero e añade una fase de pugna política y unas modificaciones en el sistema de puntuación que cambia el sistema de una forma considerable y hace que las puntuaciones sean vertiginosas. Vale la pena probarlo para notar las diferencias y disfrutar de un juego ambientado en hechos tan cercanos a la actualidad.

Comparing this to Twilight Struggle, they are very similar, but some differences were made for better and others for worse, others just change some aspects of the two games, for exemple, the game is not too much straight forward for the communists in the begining so the possibility of winning with them in the early year are reduced so the game is less punishing than Twilight Struggle, but in the middle and late war the events for the democrats in the eastern germany make it almost impossible for the communists to invest their power there. The Power Struggle system is good but it appears that the game subtle change the focus and it is not really OK. The Support Check (a merge of Realigment Roll and Coup Attempt) is a lot more effective and useful, but in the other hands you never have the chance to defend yourself with the Defcon Level. The most important change here is in the theme, Twilight Struggle has a very beautiful and global theme and 1989 has a very important history chapter but very focused in happenings in one piece of the Europe and in one year. In the end I still prefer Twilight Struggle, the game is more fluid and the history of the entire cold war is facinating, but 1989 is really a wonderful game, too, and serves well as a further chapter for those who enjoy Twilight Struggle.

A heck of a lot better than Twilight Struggle! My major complaints about TS have been addressed: less randomness and no more unexpected "death from above" game-endings after you've invested a couple of hours into the game. "New Year's Eve Party" is a new and improved "Wargames" for the Communist!

No longer is it: "I need a few battlegrounds and one non-battleground to dominate this place. Now it's ""I need a few battlegrounds and one non-battleground to dominate this place; but which specific battlegrounds are going to be useful to me? And I need more than one non-battleground: after all, I really could use some student support!" Yes, the Power Struggle cards add a degree of tension that I have never seen in Twilight Struggle. Sure, there's no Defcon, but Defcon was more a barrier rather than a sweat-inducing mechanic; and I tell you, the Power Struggles are positively nail-biting! And in Twilight Struggle, if the Soviets are doing poorly in Asia, they can't say, "Alright, Yankees: you've outscored me again in Asia. But no longer: I'm conceding Asia to you for the rest of the game, and you'll never score there again! HA!" Yes, the Communist player can do that very thing in 1989, and it's rarely an easy decision for the Commie to give up a country.

Another element of tension is when to play one of your cards for the event. In Twilight Struggle, there is a minority of cards that are NOT removed from the game if the event is played. In 1989, there are hardly any cards like that! Playing your own event is far more costly in 1989. 

Thematically, I do prefer Twilight Struggle; but the mechanics of 1989 are far more integrated into the theme than its predecessor.....except for the new Space Race, Tienanmen Square. "Yes, the OPs value of Laszlo Tokes I'm going to use in Tienanmen Square." Huh? In Twilight Struggle, you could imagine the resources represented by a card being used in the Space Race; but what possible resources are being imagined as going to support (or oppose) a bunch of students a gazillion miles away from Prague, I ask you?

The only thing that's preventing my rating from being higher is the time invested in a game of 1989. Nevertheless, it's time very well spent!

RATING: 9
Very much enjoyed this, after putting off tabling it for way too long. If you know TS you can learn this quickly (though if you don't know much about eastern Europe you might have trouble finding some of the city spaces). 
I feared that it might not have as much tension as TS due to the lack of defcon, but fear not, it has it in spades. The fact that support checks give die modifiers to adjacent countries mean that non-battleground countries become hugely important, and the fact that they most require 3+ influence to take mean that you are going to have to spend a lot of resources to take them. But all coup (support check, here) operations provide you with 2 support checks, so that work can pay off in spades.

The scoring is a little fiddly but becomes clear after you run through it. I quite enjoy the power struggle system, though it seems that the wild cards are HUGELY powerful, to the point that it is a bit jarring (the tank card that cancels the card play AND immediately removes an opponents SP is borderline ridiculous). I almost feel like this system would make a bit more sense if you were able to hold cards between power struggles somehow, allowing you to focus your efforts on building a deep suit to help ensure a timely win, though the ebbs and flows in power make that seem almost impossible. Thus, you need to control lots of countries where you are going to score! Playing TS made me want to grab battlegrounds and look ahead to future theaters, but not grabbing enough countries is a sure way to lose the power struggle, and ultimately the war.

Can't wait to try this again, for sure.

Preliminary: I won in just a few turns by locking down and scoring Poland (as the Communists) twice, which (the second time around) netted me like 18 points and a pretty decisive victory.

Some research seems to indicate that this may occur, but the Democracy player really needs to to put some effort into Poland to stop such a rout. So we'll need to give it another shot.

I liked the relative simplicity in the setup and the gameplay, along with how the power struggles play out. It creates an interestingly asymmetrical dynamic, where the Communist is trying to hold out and rescore countries while the Democrat will (typically) try to topple them.

The card play during the Power Struggles does capture the relative strengths in the region, but can be a bit swingy or dominated by single (lucky) cards (e.g. in killing whole suits).

RATING: 6
A disappointment.  The sudden collapse of communist states across eastern Europe in 1989 was a great theme crying out for simulation.  Why not build that simulation on the chassis of a game - Twilight Struggle - that I rate a 10?

However, I just don't like most of the things that make 1989 different to TS.  The main offender is the power struggle sub-system.  I get how the leader cards can promote a greater focus on lower value intellectual and elite board areas, and that the card play introduces uncertainty where TS offered only calculation.  That said, power struggles seem to offer very little bang for the buck of extending the playing time of an already long game.  Then there is that critical check on whether the Government changes after the struggle;  hugely significant and hanging on a single roll of a D6. Then there are event cards much more powerful than those in TS, like the Chinese Solution - five support checks that can change the complexion of a country, or Breakaway Baltic Republics - five vps because...I drew it.

Production quality is up to GMT's best standards, with a mounted board and a sturdy box.  Card quality isn't great.  The board is good looking and functional, however the box art is rather glum.  Did the communists cling to power after all? The rules seem comprehensive and are an easy read.

Great 2-player card driven strategy game. Gamewise it is close enough to Twilight Struggle but there are some details that really make a difference. 1989 seems for elegant. The truth is that I am not really interested in the time period described in the game thus I cant rate it higher.

RATING: 7
The narrative, mainly because of the theme, is less strong than in Twilight Struggle. I think there's a very good game in there and mustn't let comparisons with TS cause me to undervalue it. Like TS, perhaps even more so, you need to play multiple times to figure out what might happen, where danger is building etc., i.e. it rewards repeated plays. I can't see myself necessary playing enough to get much of an idea about this, and I think that's when the game would get really enjoyable, so rating suffers a bit because of that. With commitment to play enough, there's a great game in there. 

(Power Struggles slow down a PBeM game.)

This game may be TS's little brother, but it provides an overall different gameplay experience, although the game mechanics remain mostly the same.

I would gladly play it again, keeping in mind that this is a light tactical game with a bit of "take that" element, other than a deep strategic development game.

Compared to Twilight Struggle:

+Nice Scoring mechanic
+Every country has a reason to get controlled

-Too many game changing dice rolls
-Effects of cards seem a bit too powerful
-Missing DEFCON, which was imo the best TS mechanic and the one that connected all the dots of gameplay, as well as creating a thematic tension.

Muy buen juego.
Evolución del TS con el que comparte mecánicas parecidas con el añadido de los "power struggle" siguiendo un procedimiento parecido al utilizado en la resolución de los combates del Hannibal.

Siempre tenso y divertido, cuanto más conoces las cartas más se disfruta. Una lección de historia en la caja de un juego de mesa. 

No le encuentro agujero ninguno, siendo un diseño muy sólido e ideal para jugar en una sola tarde. Sus detractores son contrarios a la mecánica de los "power struggle" por el factor suerte que introduce. Siendo eso cierto, a mi no me termina de desagradar.

Feels like Twilight Struggle adapted to the fall of communism, down to me calling the wrong (TS) names to a series of game concepts. Despite this, it felt like a good fit. There's also the added gimmick of the power struggles, which seems lifted from Hannibal, which I felt didn't fit the theme quite as well, and honestly I was left unsure how much it really adds to the game.

The card events are the star attraction and are nice as usual, even though some of them felt rather overpowered. There's quite a bit of luck involved in all the die rolling that is done, but I think it's at least somewhat controllable and should even out.

Overall, it's a good game if a little derivative, but it still felt like it was missing some of the epic scope and flow of TS. Further plays will tell if the theme grows on me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Tentative Rating.

Really cool mechanics borrowed and refined from TS and other games (a Hannibal style card sub game!), absolutely dripping with theme, lots to think about and great production values.

However, the game seems to suffer from a fundamental dullness and scripting that are, to some extent, a product of the topic. The cascading nature of the events mean the game tends to progress from one country to the next (TS is somewhat less linear), while the topic (can the Communists remain in power slightly longer than they did historically?) is less interesting to me than the Cold War conflict.

Also, the power struggle rolls can determine victory simply if the Democrat player rolls consistently one way or the other. Lots of luck in general, probably more than TS.

A single classic d6 roll in a heavy game? Are you serious? This is the worst thing about the game. I don't like it generally (area control is not my cup of tea), but this die... it makes me hate the game! If I want to roll one die I'll play Verflixxt. If I want to play sth heavy with dice I need a lot of rolling (Kingsburg), but one single d6 roll with results 1-6 is an unforgivable design mistake!

It actually blew my mind the first time I played it. Theme is very close to me, so it got the nod ahead of Twilight Struggle. It can take a few hours to play (which will most likely get better with more plays), very thematic and not that difficult to play. The game system is fantastic and Power Struggle can be really tense and lots of fun. It immediately became one of my favorite games.

RATING: 6
A szabály alapján látszott, hogy kb. 50-60% az átfedés a TS-sel, de sajnos elmarad a nagy elődtől. Talán még a 6 pont is jóindulatú részemről, annak köszönhető, hogy a téma közel áll hozzám.

Pozitívumok: a hangulat egész jó, 110 kártyán azért elég jól el lehet merülni a témában. Magyar vonatkozásként visszaköszönnek pl. a rendszerváltó pártok, és még további 5 volt szoci ország szerepel a játékban. Ebben a tekintetben tökéletesen visszaadja a TS színvonalát, de egy sokkal rövidebb időszakra koncentrálva. Aki átélte a rendszerváltást, annak látszólag kötelező a játék. Hogy miért nem az mégsem, az majd a negatívumoknál.
További pozitívum, hogy belevittek egy plusz dimenziót, egy újfajta küzdelmet, ami az értékelések előtt zajlik, egy külön paklival, és arra jó, hogy nem lehet tutira menni értékelésnél, mert előtte még módosul a térkép. Annyira sikerült ezzel felturbózni a játékot, hogy szerintem ez a legösszetettebb része, kifejezetten ötletes. A tábla szép, töménytelen infóval.
Negatívum: Szerintem az egészet agyonvágja az, hogy valahogy sokkal egysíkúbb, mint a TS. A műveleti pontokat itt kevesebb fajta dologra lehet költeni, és túl egyértelmű a fonala az egésznek. Az első részben csak lengyelekre és magyarokra kell figyelni, és mivel alig van direkt GYP-s lap, gyakorlatilag csak a műveleti pontokkal játszunk végig. Mindegy mi a szöveg, a lényeg, hogy vagy közvetlen vagy próbákon keresztül potyogtatjuk le a befolyáspontokat, sőt az események is ugyanezt csinálják. Ráadásul nálunk a demokraták lenyomták azonnal mindkét országban a komcsikat, így kikerültek az értékelők, ezért onnantól egészen a játék végéig ezekkel az országokkal nem is igazán kell foglalkozni, hanem rámenni minden korban azokra az országokra, ahol épp értékelések várhatók. (Egyébként az nagy ötlet, hogy ha tartják a komcsik az országot, akkor nekik egyre többet ér egy ország, mármint bónuszként egyre többet és többet kapnak az újabb és újabb kiértékelésekre. Csak nálunk épp úgy alakult, hogy ez nem jött ki.) Helyenként sajnos kifejezetten unalmas volt. A TS ehhez képest lüktető, kiszámíthatatlan, változatos játék (gondolom nem véletlen volt top1), ott azért kell gondolkodni, itt kb. annyi, hogy megnézem a lapok színét és más szempont nem is nagyon kell, a legszarabbat elpasszolom a Tiananmen sávon(kb. mint TS-ben az űrverseny), de az ellenfélénél sem történik semmi drámai, talán 1-2 érdekesebb lapot láttam.

Az igazsághoz hozzátartozik, hogy épp csak belekóstoltam, mivel a 4. körben véget ért, így a kártyák jó részét nem is láttam, a szovjet sávon nem is haladtunk, pedig a szabályban láttam, hogy nagyon alapos a történelmi része, pl. a román forradalom tök részletesen ki van dolgozva. A Tiananmen sáv is jó, sőt szinte minden jó, de valahogy a kártyák miatt tök laposra sikerült szerintem. Csak azért adtam 6-ost, és nem rosszabbat, mert a téma jó és mert egy 80 perces parti alapján nincs szívem ennél rosszabbat adni. De sajnos a hasonló jellegű kártyavezéreltek közül eddig ez a leggyengébb szerintem.

Nyitott vagyok még egyre persze, és ha valakit nagyon érdekel a töri, azért próbálja ki, hátha csak nekünk nem jött össze.

Ami még eszembe jutott: csomó féle hely van a térképen(munkás, diák, értelmiségi stb.), nem tudom, ez kellett-e bele, a hatalmi harcok (azok vannak az értékelések előtt) érdekesek lesznek ugyan tőle, mert számít, melyik fajta városban vagyunk jók az adott országon belül, de ennyire nem kellett volna mindent ennek alárendelni. Nem érdekes annyira, mint amennyire rágyúrtak.

Pre-ordered, should be coming in any day now.  I've been following 1989: Dawn of Freedom for some time and am very excited to get it on the table.  

If you are familiar with Twilight Struggle, you will have no problem digesting 1989's rules, many of the mechanics are quite similar. 

**EDIT**
I'm really enjoying 1989: Dawn of Freedom.  I really like how similar the rules are to Twilight Struggle's rules, it makes it very easy to pick up and play.  I also really like how dissimilar it is from Twilight Struggle strategy wise, it is a completely different game.
  
1989 is fun, tense and full of difficult decisions, everything I look for in a boardgame.

The successor to the amazing Twilight Struggle, which is currently my #1 game of all time.

So is the successor better than the original? I would have to say no. To me, a lot of the greatness of TS stems from the tension of the DEFCON track, which is not in 1989.

1989 is still a very good game though, which I am always happy to play. It is also a game that I have by no means explored fully yet, so it is always high on my list of games I want to get to the table.

If you enjoy Twilight Struggle, but don't like the stress of the DEFCON track and the sometimes random DEFCON suicides, then getting 1989 is a no-brainer.

If you enjoy Twilight Struggle, but would like some variation on it from time to time, then getting 1989 is also a no-brainer.

If you enjoy Twilight Struggle, but think that it is a bit too long, then you should probably avoid 1989, as that game is even longer.

If you don't enjoy Twilight Struggle, then there's really no reason to even be reading this.

I don't think I got in enough plays of this to really gauge, but this feels like the weakest of the Jason Matthews Cold War family. I like the mechanic of the Power Struggle, but it felt more swingy and lucky than a game like this should be.

I found the scoring mechanics completely random. It all seems related to a die roll, which can give you a load of VPs or just crush you. A lot of effort in the Power Struggle go wasted in a die roll with very wide range of results. Disappointing.

RATING: 8.5
A really fun alternative to Twilight Struggle (TS). The games are very similar, with 1989 being a bit more streamlined with the removal of the DEFCON track, Headline phase, and combining coup/realignment. I enjoy TS more due to its tension and broader scope, but this is a great game in its own right. The biggest difference between the two is the presence of the Power Struggle mechanic in 1989. This is a small mini-game that the sides will play against each other when scoring cards are resolved. I enjoy this mechanic and find that it leads to some interesting timing decisions. The player in a better position in the scoring region will most likely win, but there is always a chance for the underdog. I also enjoy the asymmetric play, as the Communist player tries to keep certain regions alive in the game and scores more and more points for the longer they can hold on. I miss the tension of the DEFCON track and the ability of the players to halt their opponents plans during the headline phase, but I can appreciate that their omission helps to simplify the gameplay. Overall, the play is much less tense than Twilight Struggle and very enjoyable. Recommended for fans of TS looking for something similar with a different flavor.

I can see it raise, but there is always the chance of droping a little.

I really deslike the fact that there is no "defcon" track, something that allows players to keep doing Support Checks, which raises the luck factor of the game.

I played 2 games, one for each side. Playing the comunist side is very hard. You can really feel the rope around your neck !!!

I'm the developer, so this is obviously a bit biased, but I love this game, and repeated plays have not changed that.  I only consider 3 games to be 10s (Up Front, Twilight Struggle, and Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage).  I'm not going to be bold enough to put 1989 with those games, but it's up there with everything else in my collection.

If you are a Twilight Struggle fan who also enjoys the battle cards from Hannibal (like me!), you should really check this game out.

The theme is rich and engaging, especially as I hadn't known nearly enough about this era before. I appreciate the asymmetrical makeup of the deck; compared with Twilight Struggle, the different strategies of the two sides are more deeply ingrained in the gameplay. The Power Struggle mechanic is a little dissociative, but it's okay.

RATING: 7.5
A very similar feel to Twilight Struggle but a bit more focused, due to the semi-random scoring order. It did seem that the game was very much tilted against the democrats, at least initially, with things improving mid-year - though not by enough to stop a runaway victory for the forces of communism. Fairly slow on first play, as is inevitable with card driven games, but not too many rules queries to look up, which suggests it should speed up considerably with experience.

RATING: 6
4 plays in, the bloom is off. 1989 does a lot of stuff right, but it still has Twilight Struggle's fatal flaw: it's just too long. The wheels just come completely off about two-thirds of the way through; the last few turns are really tedious. We play 4+ hours of game for only 5-7 of the crucial scoring events, several of which are likely to be quite uninteresting. There is just way too little game here to justify the bloated playing time.

Labyrinth remains the only really interesting title to use these basic mechanics.
---
I've gotten frustrated with the Twilight Struggle engine, as designers have continued to hammer away at a basic system that has some fundamental, fairly serious problems, mostly having to do with math. Labyrinth finally made it work pretty well, and while 1989 still has some of the underlying problems of TS (too long given what it is, too much arbitrarily swingy luck, mildly unsatisfactory endgame), it also does a lot right. Tempo is better, the narrative arc of expanding conflict is more natural, the tactical board play is more nuanced and interesting, and the theme is more solidly integrated - it's a more than just historically-named cards. The Power Struggle cards, while not totally effective as a game mechanism, are still a great tension-builder and a nice touch. They seem very random the first couple times you play them, but there is a little more there than meets the eye. Also, games remain tighter longer. Twilight Struggle was prone to blow-outs and long grinding losses if the Soviets could leverage the early game, which often wasn't too hard. 1989 feels much better, with the Democrats gaining strength as the game goes on and becoming increasingly desperate to evict the commies.

Anyway, 1989 isn't anywhere close to being in the same league as the CDG classics like Hannibal or Paths of Glory, probably not even as good game-wise as Labyrinth, but it's a solid offering which I've found enjoyable, much more than Twilight Struggle. I'd bet the lifespan of the game doesn't go much past 10 games, but that's fine.

The sequel...sorta, to Twilight Struggle. I like most of the changes that were made here. Condensing coups and realignments into a single sort of action that combines aspects of both is a good simplification. The whole power struggle "minigame" results in non-battleground spaces being way more important to control, which I like. Also did some interesting things with events being dependent on others or waiting to trigger.

Once I saw how competitive the game could be with a clever Communist player, i realized that i really liked this game.  One of the things I love about 1989 is that it makes great use of several Twilight Struggle mechanics, but adds enough changes to the cards, support checks, and scoring to help it stand on its on.  Components overall are solid GMT quality although I noticed my board doesn't lie flat as well as it should and the cards are too stiff for shuffling.  Like TS players must have an idea of the cards that will become available in the different periods.  If asked to choose between preference for TS and 1989, I would take TS on most days, and that is mostly due to the fact that I prefer the Cold War theme played out on a global scale.  Nonetheless 1989 is a great game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Interesting subject. But considering how quickly the commies folded everywhere and them having so little fight left in them at that point, it seems like it'd best make a solitaire game with the player representing the  forces of democracy etc., while the game system throws in the monkey wrenches the commies (and Maggie Thatcher -> German Reunification, for that matter) were yet able to throw in.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
So far, the lack of nuclear war leads to a game with less tension than its parent game, TS. As well, I prefer the simpler scoring of TS. However, the game of 1989 is overall more straightforward and easier to learn: the scoring and shutting down of areas concentrates attention during the game; as well, how to spend your OPs is way easier to understand as there are fewer rules surrounding it.

Well... I can probably safely say that games like this and Twilight Struggle simply aren't my cup of tea. I appreciate that the game is trying to bring in the historical theme, but the things that really dampen my enthusiasm are the sheer length of play and the feeling that the games mechanics evoke.

The game I played felt like a slow death by 1000 cuts. I had the sense I was losing... but by very minor increments with each turn. The result is an awareness that a win is out of reach, but with no opportunities to make any big plays, any big comebacks to right the ship.

Maybe with familiarity I'd find more in the game to like, but I'm not sure I'm willing to make the investment as there's plenty of other games I'd rather play at a 2.5 hour time commitment.

I'm intrigued with this one.  1989 seems to be a Twilight Struggle/Hannibal hybrid.  It's TS 99% of the way through, but with a Power Struggle phase that augments TS's normal scoring phase and adds Power Struggle "battle cards" to the mix, similar to Hannibal.  The scoring cards are removed for countries that topple the Communists, which creates an interesting pressure for the Reds to try to hold on for as long as they can.  Also, support is a little different in that you get 2 support attempts with your ops card.  I really like the different factions and the cards are quite interesting.  In fact, it may even be an improved system compared to good old Twilight Struggle?  I think I have to pick this one up!

We picked this up because it's from the folks who made Twilight Struggle. Turns out it's a very different but very good game to play; despite many surface similarities with TS, it requires a different approach (for example the way you deploy to the board). We like TS a bit more, it has more tension, but this makes for a nice change from time to time. Traded away only because we're more likely to play TS.

RATING: 9
Preliminary rating, after one 4.5 hour play (including rules). The game shouldn't normally be that long but it went the full distance, and with every card being new to me it really slowed the game down. But the time flew by without me noticing.  I won't give a 10 with one play, but to me this is a more accessible Twilight Struggle. TS has my admiration, but mostly from a distance... this I can see me playing a lot.

3 plays now. Warrants the rating. Not as punishing on the learning curve as TS, but still pretty steep!

I like this more than Twilight Struggle because of:

1. The freedom to place influence anywhere, doesn't need to be connected to the regions you control. So fights can happen pretty much anywhere immediately.

2. The "trick taking" mini-game, which is so thematic and much better than just tallying up points during a region scoring.

Also, I played this before I played Twilight Struggle...which might be the whole reason I like it more.

RATING: 9.6
Obviously, 1989 follows the footprints of its "father", Twilight Struggle - we are basically talking of the same game here.
The theme is connected but somewhat different and there were introduced some changes that made the game run more smoothly (without so many exceptional and special rules).
For the better and the worst, there is no more tension about the game suddenly ending in nuclear war but there is a "mini-game" (Power Struggle) that makes your heartbeat hit the scales whenever there is a scoring.
Also of notice is the original feature of one side just tries to hold the position while the other tries to gain ground, so the score is always more uncertain than in TS.
The game is very well conected to the theme, since the countries and the places depicted are very connected to reality, in terms of the influence of the religion, the students, the workers, the farmers, etc. 
Great and fascinating to play!

Clearly owes a great debt to Twilight Struggle (some of the Event effects are even patterned after certain ones in Twilight Struggle), but the adaptation of We the People / Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage Battle Cards to the game's Power Struggle system is is a nice twist.

Decent, lighter area control game. It's simple and straightforward, with only four actions to choose from, some interesting events, and decisions that feel meaningful. There's some tension, especially when you get a bunch of your opponent's cards or you're not sure when or where the scoring is going to happen.

The designers clearly took note of some of the issues with [i]Twilight Struggle[/i] and fixed them properly. First, the Tiananmen Square track, their version of the space race, isn't nearly as random. You can now improve your chances by playing a higher ops card or your own event (or both) and you'll likely still get a +1 for your next attempt if you botch it. Second, the scoring cards work differently, and now there's a power struggle, which is very much like the [i]Hannibal: Rome vs Carthage[/i] combat system strangely enough. So, having control over more areas is good, but it's not automatic victory for scoring that area.

On the down side, it may be a bit too long and a bit too simple to support itself in the long run. It could go 10 turns, but I think I'd burn out by turn 8. Overall I'd say I liked it better than [i]Twilight Struggle[/i], but not quite as much as [i]Labyrinth[/i].

I really really wanted to like this one, I honestly did. The whole late-Eighties vibe suited me, I'm fascinated by the Cold War, once played TS more times in a week than I had hot meals, and have got Nena's autograph (via an ex-gf).

But I didn't enjoy this one as much as I thought I would. *sad face* And, worse, I can't quite articulate why. The components are, as ever with GMT, very nicely designed, and the box could withstand a small nuclear blast. I very much liked the new mechanic of the Power Struggle deck, adding a degree of tension that was missing during the TS Scoring phases.

Perhaps that's the main problem though. After perhaps 6 dozen games of TS over the past 2 years, maybe I've flogged that particular card-driven mechanic to death. I also *hated* the board design, which being way off the usual 4:3 or 16:9 ratio, ensured that every game concluded with both my opponent and I getting a severe crick in the neck - seriously, why couldn't there be more abstraction (compaction?) in the country layout and linkage, given that it is a game of politics and not geography after all? The board, at root, is an oversized map of Eastern Europe in the North-South orientation, and really should have been on a West-East view, partly for sheer aesthetics but also to perhaps recreate the East vs West feel.

The Tiananmen Square track also feels like a naff replacement for the Space Race track, whilst recreating none of the horror or drama of events in Beijing. The use of negative scoring for the communist player also irked me after a while - if communism was indeed so bad (and it broadly was, let's not pretend otherwise), why then did Bulgaria elect a communist government in it's first free elections, and why did so many 'osties' vote communist in reunified Germany?

My long-time opponent summed it up best after the first play-through: "It's Twilight Struggle, but with the best bits taken out."

Amen, Reverend.

I'll need to get this to the table a few more times for a better review, but my initial few games of this are positive. It's much more, err, swing-y than its predecessor, Twilight Struggle, but that's not always a bad thing. Sometimes I feel like most everything in TS is static at a certain point, but that's never the case in 1989. The "coup" mechanic is essentially doubled and unburdened by a DEFCON track, so it seems much more beneficial and potentially rewarding to just coup all the time. Having fun with it, but need to play it more.

RATING: 8
Very interesting outgrowth of Twilight Struggle with enough twists and turns to make it its own game. Play fairly quickly for a CDG (under 3 hours), but as the Russian, prepare for a fairly rough ride. Lots of tension and lots of nasty cards.

Oh, and make sure to grab a ref sheet or to make your own. The one that comes with the box, which is unusual for GMT, isn't very good.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very provisional rating of 8 after one play. So far it seems pretty good. The Power Struggle mechanic makes it very different in feeling than Twilight Struggle - a superior poker player can hold off someone with better board position. There's other notable differences as well - the lack of Defcon especially makes for a less visceral sense of tenseness, but the game makes up for this with having every single space matter and increased tenseness in "in-country" board play compared to TS. Also no cheap VP on the Space Race.

I am unsure about the amount of dice rolling in this one, and other things, but I like it so far. But true knowledge really requires knowing the deck, and that will take a few times through with both sides.

RATING: 6
Of the games using the Twilight Struggle system this one I am least enamored with this one. Twilight Stuggle of the CDGs is particularly dependent on the card events to drive the action and the theme (unlike for instance Hannibal Rome vs Carthage where other mechanics carry the weight). As such if you are familiar with the events it is an enjoyable pop history lesson, but when you don't it becomes really dry. I have a nerdy niche history buff interest in the subject matter of 1989 but there is not enough in the game to really open the door for me, as such i spend point cards to put points on spaces and play a rather mediocre card matching game when a scoring card is played. Interesting elements are there but it all feels so dry. If you are interested in this topic i recommend Wir Sind Das Volk over this, by building the game around the development and stability of an industrial network the game captures an identifiable narrative that gives me more investment than cards with pictures of old dudes on them.

1989: Dawn of Freedom owes a lot to Twilight Struggle.  In fact it almost feels as if it's a new map with rule tweaks... the kind of thing you would see in different Power Grid or Age of Steam maps.  If I had never played Twilight Struggle before I would would have rated this one quite highly.  The fact of the matter is that I have played Twilight Struggle and I prefer it to 1989.  I definitely prefer the Cold War theme of Twilight Struggle with a map of the world over 1989's view of Eastern Europe and the fall of Communism.  I consider Twilight Struggle to have a lot more tension due to the fact that someone can automatically lose due to the Def Con level.  Finally, the Power Struggles of 1989, while somewhat interesting, feels disjointed from the rest of the game.

I think the main question to be answered is, "Is 1989 better than Twilight Struggle?". Answer: Not much difference. The problem is that the basic abstract engine is still there - get cards, look at cards. If the event is good, play the event. If not, play to put your counters on the map and get majorities. Not much different from an area-majority Eurogame, and there are better ones than 1989. At least they don't take 4.5 hours to play. 

The theme is also a bit more obscure compared to the  grander scale Cold War theme in Twilight Struggle. You don't feel as connected to some of the events in the cards unless you have a deep interest in modern Bulgarian history, for example.

And the Power Struggle cards are rubbish. They make the game more swingy, make the game even longer than Twilight Struggle and don't connect thematically with the main game well at all. 

Can't say that it's an improvement on TS, which I didn't much like in the first place.

RATING: 9
Twilight Struggle for the Central/Eastern European Modern History inclined.  Since I fit somewhat in that category and love TS...this easily gets a 9.  

It adds tense "power struggles" which can really throw scoring all over the place (in a good way).

RATING: 9
First play felt a little more random than TS, but that's a good thing in some ways. TS proceeds in a scripted way, to a certain extent; certain areas come into play at a very set pace. This felt much more open-ended. The power struggle mechanic randomizes things a bit, but it can also prevent a game from stacking up against you. In all but one of the power struggles I saw, a player with a weaker hand still had a chance of stopping an opponent victory, and even the one crushing defeat didn't determine the outcome of the game. A good experience.

As a Twilight Struggle and CDG fan I'm very enthusiastic about this game! Excellent components, real historic events as background to playing cards, exciting hand management, interesting and challenging mini-game (Power Struggle)... If you're familiar with TS, you'll learn this game easily. However, 1989 is interesting enough to be a game of its own compared to Twilight Struggle.

Really looking forward to play this game again and again! Looks really good at the moment - my rating might even raise higher than 9! And as my friend said it aloud, it's always fun to have a piece of Finland as a tiny part of an international game (Helsinki Final Act -event)... ;)

RATING: 7
Spot on themes and mechanics; however, I find this to be an odd game that is hard to like. Unlike a lot of other asymmetrical CDGs that I enjoy (Hannibal and Sword of Rome) this game tilts towards one side (Communists) and is then landslide for the other side (Democrats). 

The overall feeling is that if the Communist player is not firmly in the lead by the mid period, just concede and try again or play something else.

The main differences between this and TS is that the events seem to be much stronger. I think I might enjoy the game more if I spent the time learning all the events but I just think it may not be worth while.

Pourquoi traduire 1989 ? (publié dans le dernier Vae Victis)
Parce que ces quelques mois sont extraordinaires, jugés comme tels à l’époque et encore plus aujourd’hui. Une période s’ouvre de grands tumultes en Europe, d’espérances, qui annoncent la chute de l’URSS en 1991. En un an seulement, des certitudes et des murs s’effondrent, des barbelés et des tyrans sont renversés, des faux prophètes se voient définitivement discrédités, la voie est pavée pour que Fukuyama annonce «la fin de l’histoire »  … 1989 comme plus tard  2008 resteront comme des dates pivot de l’Histoire contemporaine. 
Parce que c’est une partie de la jeunesse de ma génération, avec les débats politiques de l’époque (le fameux « globalement positif »), avec de grands élans. Même si il est clair qu’au-delà des aspirations à la liberté, au-delà du fameux « N’ayez plus peur ! » de Jean-Paul II, le principal moteur des révolutions aura été une crise économique généralisée en Europe de l’Est due à l’inefficience d’un système hyper centralisé, période troublée qui entre en résonnance avec les évènements du printemps arabe de 2011. Et « 1989 » le reflète bien. Parce que comme disait B. Franklin, « l’humanité se divise en trois catégories : ceux qui ne peuvent pas bouger, ceux qui peuvent bouger et ceux qui bougent. »
Parce que j’ai vu la Tchéquie et la Pologne à l’été 1981, où il n’y avait plus ni détergent ni savon, et où la plupart des plats indiqués sur les cartes des restaurants étaient barrés … mais un pays où des varsoviens que nous ne connaissions pas nous ont accueillis chez eux avec une gentillesse extrême. Où j’ai vu un gosse de Cracovie déguster longuement une friandise en chocolat sous le contrôle de sa mère attentive …
Parce que ce jeu brillant, tendu, a été conçu par une équipe GMT d’exception - en s’inspirant de Twilight Struggle qui fait référence - avec des cartes d’évènements, et leurs commentaires lumineux. Parce que « 1989 » est un pur jeu d’histoire et de révolution, bonne introduction à des jeux plus stratégiques.
Parce que « Léon » de Ludistratège et sa bonne humeur était de la partie, et que Christophe d’Héxasim a su être compréhensif avec notre souci du détail … et qu’en cherchant ensemble à produire de la qualité on est tous enclin à vouloir développer les jeux d’histoire, surtout avec le potentiel de « 1989 ». 
Parce que les tensions actuelles, la pauvreté et le populisme exacerbent à nouveau les nationalismes et font rejaillir le passé, celui de 1989 et au-delà, comme nous le savons bien dans ce journal. Parce qu’on ne peut oublier que l’Allemagne a dû adosser un pays en ruine depuis la chute du mur, que la Tchécoslovaquie n’existe plus, que la Bulgarie et la Roumanie sont fragiles …
Parce qu’en lisant un quotidien du soir, j’y ai encore lu récemment  les noms de Kurt Masur, de Balzerowicz, et de Viktor Urban, au pouvoir en Hongrie, et qui sont tous dans « 1989 » …
Parce que  dans « 1989 » met en scène Walesa, Wojtyla, Havel, et primus inter pares Gorbatchev, l’homme qui a su gérer la transition avec si peu d’effusion de sang. Parce que Friedrich Hegel qui a dit que « l’histoire nous apprend que nous n’apprenons rien de l’histoire », a dû oublier de se réabonner à Vae Victis …




Bon jeu à tous,

Michel

Very evocative of 1989, the year that brought the fall of the Berlin Wall. The theme is exquisitely interesting and brings to life the history of the subject matter.

The game feels more random—jumpy—than Twilight Struggle because of the socio-economic icons and the smaller map. Insertions of influence are less predictable than in Twilight Struggle, which makes the game interesting.

On the other hand, for me, the jury is still out for me on the utility of the Hannibal-style/Friedrich-style mini-game necessary to resolve Power Struggles. It makes the game more random (slightly) but not in a way that seems to add. It doesn't seem to detract either. It just feels like it lengthens the game unnecessarily.

Fantastic game!!! 

The portrayal of the tensions of those times, as the west tried to encroach on the communists is remarkable.

Lots of tension and political battles. But they are not complicated. They are just way to be smarter, more cunning and to out think the opponent. Which is EXACTLY how things were in the communist block at those times. 

At the same time you learn a piece of history of every country in the soviet block. Major events, that took place that were VERY important as they happened. 

I just played this game for 6 hours and we only got HALF WAY through the game!!! We still had another 4 rounds to go out of 8 total!!! And I couldn't wait to finish!!!

Really outstanding game!! 10 time better than Twighlight Struggle, because the topic at hand is concentrated in one area of the world. That makes it easier to immerse yourself in the game!!!  

Really, really outstanding game. Seek it and and buy it!!! You won't be disappointed.

I tried it once and I did not really like it. It's like Twilight Struggle but they added the "Power Struggle" mechanism that I find completely uninteresting, long, tedious and boring. 
At the end, it felt like a chore to draw those cards and I would have preferred to be able to say "I lose the PS, let's continue the game" but PS is mandatory.
Comparatively, TS is simpler, straightforward, light, allows you to plan in advance and there's a real feeling that the Cold War can end in either direction while, in 1989, the soviet player must have the feeling that he's just trying to limit the damages.

Hookay. Were it not for Twilight Struggle, I would undoubtedly rate the game far higher. Given its incredible similarity to TS, I feel entitled to evaluate strictly in comparison with the latter--so here goes.
-I like the Power Struggles, but they feel a bit swingy.
-I lurve the new coup rules.
-I lurve Tiananmen Square over Space Race.
-I am exceedingly dubious of the pacing of the game--is it really supposed to be such a slow bleed of the Communist player? It feels almost like a siege game.
-I am also dubious of how countries that turn democratic become almost 100% irrelevant until final scoring.

Overall, though, the events, persons and places modeled in 1989 are less familiar and compelling to me than those in TS. In that basis alone, I am willing to say that  1989 has almost no need to exist in my gaming library. That said, I do wish some of its incremental improvements could be ported to TS.

On P500 Pre-Order (on 02-Dec-11 - arrived 23-May-12)

This seems an obvious pre-order for someone who gives Twilight Struggle a 10.
Being toghether with someone from the former DDR and having a great interest in the 1989 revolutions, are all the more reasons to anticipate this game.

UPDATE: First impressions are that this game is far more chaotic then TS, but card knowledge will reduce this in future games. Power struggles are an intense added feature, with lots of Pro's & Con's.
Playing Democrats feels like being on the attack the whole game, where being the Communist is like defending the whole game.

It's a very good game. I've seen criticisms of the power struggle mechanic, but I agree with others who note that these events were far from a sure thing, and that is reflected in the power struggles.

RATING: 5
I tried to like this game, I really did. It's cool that once you score a country it's possible that the scoring card can be drawn again and the country scored again. Yup, that's all I have for the good.

And now the bad. I hate the card driven battle system when a country is scored. A scoring card is played and I have to set down my hand, count up, and deal another set of cards to play a silly game of Go Fish. There's no strategy to the battle part, it's mostly luck. And then after the card fight portion is over there's a list of steps to find the outcome of the battle and then country scoring. 

It just seems that the game is going along just fine until a scoring card is played and then suddenly the momentum of the game is stopped to play a mini-game that is nonstrategic and unthematic.

If you're ever in the mood to play a longer and shittier version of Twilight Struggle, then 1989 is the game for you. Me, I'll stick to Twilight Struggle and Labyrinth.

RATING: 10
[b]1989[/b] is clearly the child of its predecessor Twilight Struggle but it distinguishes itself in meaningful ways (some of which I find reminiscent of WsdV!). As I see it, the most meaningful refinements are the following: 1. the streamlined and combined coup+realignment (without giving it points, making it a 'no brainer' in TS often); 2. the ways in which every card had multiple uses that were often competing with one another (I find that in TS, some cards are almost always going to be used for points, others for their events -- the 'choice' only emerges in particular situations); 3. the card play of the power struggle (at scoring) means that scoring is not simply a question of numerical presence (i.e., which locations you occupy can be as important as how many). I guess what I'm saying is that there are more meaningful (read: difficult and non-obvious) choices to make.

With this design, there are hints at discussions elsewhere which reveal that Twilight Struggle was a brute force design (i.e., the cards were balanced predominantly through playtesting) wherein 1989 was balanced in shape and form before the refinements of playtesting. It shows growth from the designers and offers a somewhat less swingy game but in which there are far less "obvious" choices and potentially less of a need to "know the decks" in order to play (although knowing the decks, like with TS, is probably paramount to high level play).

After [b]1 play[/b], I rate this a [b]strong 7[/b], although I imagine that this could easily be an 8 (potentially overtaking TS for me) or a 9 if my suspicions about a greater diversity of choice is on-the-money.

Tense game with a strongly felt atmosphere of struggle between the democrats and the communists in Eastern Europe. The rules are rather straight forward, although there were a couple of things I missed during the first game. It takes a game or two to understand and optimize strategies.

A sequel, of sorts, to Twilight Struggle in that it borrows the game structure from TS and combines it with the battlecard mechanism from We the People. The result is slightly lighter than TS, but the history is more obscure and the cards less flavourful. Having borrowed much from TS, inevitably 1989 shares some of its problems: it's vulnerable to 'blowouts' where one player gets to auto-victory in just a few turns, the Democrat player is favoured in the long run and a ten turn game goes on a long time. In WtP I'm very much a fan of the battlecard system, but here it just adds playing time to a game that's always in danger of taking too long. Fundamentally this game has taken a little too much from TS, while losing out on TS's only real selling point: the theme.

Really fantastic game. Tense throughout, a constant stream of horrible decisions to be made, but even when things are going badly the situation only feels desperate, rather than hopeless. The way the board position affects the power struggles is excellent. Tells a brilliant story too. Love it!

RATING: 9
1989 is certainly different enough from Twilight Struggle to be worth playing even for veterans of the latter. It is not quite as compelling as its predecessor as it is a little less thematic - for example the effects of the card events are more generalised. In terms of game mechanics, there are one or two improvements over TS - such as the combination of Coups and into Realignment Rolls into a single mechanism. On the other hand, the Power Struggles (with mechanics borrowed from Hannibal) feel awkward thematically and take too much time. The scoring is less predictable and more volatile than in TS due to the change element in both the Power Struggles and die-rolling for VPs.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
It builds upon the splendid engine of Twilight Struggle elaborating it even further.  The quality of the design and the fun factor are on par with TS if not better.
I'm absolutely delighted.

--

Several components taken unchanged from Twilight Struggle.  The most meaningful addition i.e. the core of Power Struggle mechanic is taken from Hannibal: Rome vs Carthage.  Some original ideas too - mostly successful (e.g. differentiation of types of spaces, scoring not only for presence/domination/control, but also for Power Struggle result and for keeping at power (by Communist player) etc).

Decent, but not as good as Twilight Struggle. I'd love to see a second printing of this, but I doubt it would happen. 

My biggest beef is that the cities and locations are all foreign to my Western ears and I spend a good minute with every card trying to figure out where the city is. A small letter or symbol on a card representing the respective country would be a big help.

Great game, but I can take it or leave it. Long playtime for what is essentially a very simple game mechanically.

Obviously very heavily influenced by Twilight Struggle but that's hardly a negative.  

I wasn't a big fan of the Hannibal-style scoring phases as there seemed a lot of variance in the results relative to the actual margins gained on the board play.

On the positive side, the support checks are a nice way to retain the Realignment mechanic from TS in a more accessible way to new players.

After one play I couldn't see any serious flaws in the game even relative to Twilight Struggle.  My personal makeup is such that I can't handle a high-intensity chess match of a game like this more than once or twice a year but 1989 will definitely go in the rotation for when the occasion arises.

1989 is an evocative and tense socio-politico game set against the backdrop of revolution in the Eastern Bloc. It is impossible not to compare it to its older brother Twilight Struggle; here are some highlights:

- The Space Race has been replaced by Tiananmen Square. 
- Coup and Realignment rolls combined as Support Checks.
- Power Struggles add a localized ideological aspect.
- No Defcon nor subsequent Military Operations tracks. 
- More starred, one-off cards. 
- No headline phase.
- Countries routinely fall out of contention via Power Struggle outcomes.

Really the two are quite similar; perhaps the biggest change are the power struggles which tend to make all the spaces relatively important.

Not bad; so far not as good as TS though. More luck involved, due to the power struggle card draws and the victory rolls. Card events do not seem as memorable as TS cards, they seem to have mostly generic effects. I like the idea of giving incentive to control non-battleground countries though.

Excellent game. The same meachanichs and nearly as good as Twilight Struggle. A minor drawback is that a single dice roll or card can make a big shift in VP. The power struggles are excellent and I really like the rules for the Tianamen Square ladder. Seems to be tricky for the democracy player.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Similar to TS, great time period, cant wait to play!

So - 4 plays in 3 as democratic and 1 as Communist.

First game was a blow out for the Communist on VP in round 4. Poland can be key in this game and the player who manages to do well in the scoring can often set the tone for the next scoring.

The second game went longer, but I was still unable to curb the communists ability to control the card decks, and a couple of bad hands later the game was over.

Play 3 went the full 10 turns, with a 16VP win for the democrats : ) Playtime was about 3 hours.

Play 4 was my first as communist against a new player. Went 4 hours, 10 turns and a 20VP win on final scoring after hanging onto and scoring 4 countries out of 6.

Good:
Theme is excellent and engrossing
Rules light
Power struggle is very tense

Bad:
Can be swingy on some die rolls
You need to develop card knowledge, especially the chained cards to play well

Overall - the best game of the year so far easily.

RATING: N/A
Very similar to Twilight Struggle.
The rules seem to read a little like Reagan propoganda.  For example they insinuate (through inclusion and omission) that only Communism results a powerful elite ruling class, an inefficient beaurocracy, unhappy minorities seeking autonomy and bodies of dissillusioned students.

As someone painfully awake when it comes to the histories of Policitcal Science I find the dumbing down of political reality to a level acceptable to bubba and his sister-cousin who each have bald eagles tatooed on their arses and believe that there is a distinction between right and wrong, and that distinction is democratic freedom along with wild west unbridled free market economics (though they'd probably call it Amer'canism) and anything remotely looking like freedom hating rights stomping Communism all the while ignoring shortcomings of democracy like American Hegemony in Latin America,  the ultimate corruption of political power in the USA and the Quebec question in Canada, Basque question in Spain, Irish Question in Northern Ireland...

Okay - the lesser of the evils is some form of free and democratic western society - only a maroon would argue against it, but my point is that this game seems to reflect the common belief that Communism had/has cornered the market on evil and life in a market based democratic society is all sunshine and lolipops - a concept that is ever so wonderfully absent from Twilight Struggle.

I'm looking forward to playing again and again and again!

A very exciting game for me because of the theme. What fascinates me about 1989: a. how extremely well researched the game is and how accurate the cards are b. how well the mechanics fit the theme; whatever you do you relieve history c. tons of replayability d. very engaging gameplay and lots of desision making. e. CDG mechanics! The bestest game I have ever played so far! I am in total awe. Lots of thanks and respect go to the designers! Kudos to Ted for taking TS and shaping it brilliantly in a new direction, with new historical detail.

Update: since my last update the game has been published. Wonderful components, top notch quality all around. (Custom made  dice will put the crown on top.) I played my first game, and I am even more of a fan of the game than I was before. It is well worth the time and effort to learn the rules and play the game (I have never played TS before). Everything is so very thematic in the game! 1989: Dawn of Freedom lets you become part of history and involves you in such a way than not many other games does.
I really hope this game will do very well in the rankings, but most of all, I wish a lot of people gave this awesome game a try. 
Update: having received and played the boardgame helped a lot to internalize the rules and get better at the game.

TS variant with much more luck based scoring and some events are far too powerful. Tiananmen track is pretty good.
When you'll get dominated in a country its very hard to come back, only way to get back is to get some powerful events.
Scoring discards also limits options pretty much. When democrats gets power (depends on one die roll if democrats win) then that country is out of play for the rest of the game, (except final scoring), I find that's not a good thing at all. Still fun to play.

RATING: 5
Another amazing design by Jason Matthews.  Similar to Twilight Struggle in that is it a CDG with similar area control mechanics but the game FEELS so much different with limited connections between spaces, additional space classifications, more freedom in making support checks (compared to coups).  The power struggle mechanic is slightly flawed in that many, likely most, will be decided even prior to a card draw.  I can take it or leave it.  The game does not provide a great way to keep track of how many times an area has been scored or keep track of who has control.  And it does seem nearly worthless to spend ops in areas that are under democratic control.  So I don't give it the 10 that I would give Twilight Struggle but I do think it is a great game and well deserving of a 9.  

UPDATE: 3 plays in and my opinion has deteriorated.  Too much direction towards Poland and Hungary early makes the game pretty much decided after the first 3 or 4 rounds.  Bulgaria and Romania were not incorporated into the game well and can be completely ignored.  This is inferior to TS, 1960, Paths of Glory and likely won't see much more playing time for me.  I'll probably get another game in or two but won't suggest it.

I love Twilight Struggle. But this game doesn't work for me. And I wanted to like it due to theme connected to my country. 

However I am missing more actions from Twilight. Also card metagame is nowhere near as interesting as in Hannibal. And I also don't think that it complements this theme. It is also pretty random in draw phase. 

So overall this game was huge disappointment for me.

It's Twilight Struggle rethemed, but the sharks have not yet analyzed it to death.  I care a lot about the subject matter, so I'm the target audience here.  I have a few qualms at this point.  I'm not sure the TS style of map correctly models how a revolution spread; it doesn't spill over borders per se.  Second, I'm not thrilled with the We The People use of cards to resolve struggles.  Third, unlike TS, I have a hard time seeing someone want to play the hard-liners.  They are competitive, but you're not going to get the same kind of smack talk you get in TS.  But it does seem to be a competitive game...

Compared to Twilight Struggle, 1989: Dawn of Freedom is disappointing. The main problem of the game are many extremely powerful events that completely break the game. Can you imagine what impact on TS would have cards that allow to make 5 coups or give you an instant control over one battleground and one additional country? That's what 1989 is like.

I think this game is better than TS. It's more balanced, both between the sides and among the various options within the game, and this despite being more asymmetrical. Better balance makes for harder choices — for instance, stronger and more balanced events make the modal choice of event vs. OPS much more interesting.

The power struggles do lengthen the game, but in terms of procedural overhead relative to gameplay, it's not so bad. I find deck-building games have a much worse ratio, yet they're very popular. The card play is interesting. While you're focused on winning the struggle, there are also externalities related to the broader context incorporated through petition, rallies and the special cards. Furthermore, influencing the power struggle gives you a reason to place influence where you otherwise wouldn't. Overall I'd say the integration of this mechanism is subtle but compelling. I don't agree at all that it's a totally separate mini-game bolted onto the design.

Development on the board in this game proceeds in stages from one hotspot to another much moreso than in TS, but that's neither here nor there. It's just an element of structure that sets this game apart.

Lastly, I don't think the level of randomness is any different than TS. Power struggles and stronger events do add some to the randomness, but other types of random screwage have been removed. By allowing more back-and-forth play on the board through the removal of DEFCON, you're not so much locked in to the result of an unfavourable roll. You can try again, within reason, and minimize the damage. You can leverage adjacent regions, and the opportunity to use modifiers to bend the odds is greater. DEFCON suicide is another source of randomness in TS. Skilled players prepare for it, but they're also compelled to take risks when it seems opportune. It adds tension, but part of that comes from the randomness that it imparts to TS.

Any fan of Twilight Struggle will love this game.  It feels very similar, though the addition of the Power Struggle cards adds a refreshing twist to the very calculated scoring of Twilight Struggle.  I also like that it is focused on a few specific countries.  The game almost feels like a history lesson in addition to being a strategic delight.  Since it is new, I have not yet found an opponent who can last more than 7 rounds though, but I look forward to getting more experienced opponents in the future.  

As with all GMT games, the components have a bit of a cheap feel, and there is no thought given to a meaningful storage solution.  The box is too small to accompdate the a GMT Storage Tray with all the other components unless you break the decks down into many small sets of cards.  

Overall, though, this game is fabulous and fun, and I learn quite a bit while playing it.

RATING: 9
There are a lot of similarities to Twilight Struggle in this one and I hesitate to develop much of an opinion until I learn the cards.  First impressions seem to indicate that the Democrat player must not allow the Communists to control too many of the junction points on the map.  There seems to be quite a few chokepoints on the 1989 map and map play seems to be much more difficult (not as many cards grant free SPs to put into just any country).  The coup is replaced with what seems to be a mixture of the coup and realignment from TS which happens to also be modified by adjacent controlled territories.  

The key difference is the power struggle that occurs after each scoring card is played.  This is another deck of cards used to actually battle for power in the country based on how many territories you control in the country.  If the Communist wins this struggle, they will potentially score three times for one scoring card - for the power struggle, the multiplier for the power win of the country (assuming the Communist doesn't abdicate power), and then the usual country scoring for presence/control/domination).  

I do wish GMT would print a description from the get go about how some of the different cards work - some of the cards aren't always quite clear.  

Just as in TS, you will want to be aware of certain cards that are quite powerful for either side depending on the situation.  Also, 1989 has neutral cards which either side can use with impunity and many are quite strong.  

All in all, an excellent game that is probably a bit more swingy and chaotic than TS, but perhaps more plays will indicate otherwise!  This is the only TS progeny thus far that has really come close and which I look forward to playing more in the future.

Very good implementation of the Twilight Struggle system to a related (but greatly condensed) period of conflict.  The "We the People" like battle card play for the Power Struggles made things interesting.  I also like the idea of scoring the same countries multiple times and rewarding the communist player for holding out against the tide for as long as possible.

RATING: 8
Twilight Struggle to Europe!  It follows the popular game of Twilight Struggle with a specific reflection on the final days of the Cold War.  Some say it is highly unbalanced favoring the West.  I shall see with game play.  For reason of Tinanmen Square, this short but specific period clicks on many Chinese.  So does the game.  

It's virtually Twilight Struggle in eastern Europe.  The engines of placement of support points (influence points) in the respective cities, support checks (coups), scoring cards, etc. are the same, except for Power Struggle segment during scoring and the absence of Defcon to hit the nuclear button.  The game tempo is slower than that of Twilight Struggle but the scale is different for comparison.  The city names are stranger to many who don't know the geography of eastern Europe.  There are many cards which are removed if played as events and hence it sounds like better to play your cards as OPs than to use the events and let them happen when they are played by opponent. However, I played the game not enough to know the subtleties and it might not be a good strategy to do so, particularly when the events are in dire needs.  When are the needs arise is really a question of judgement of the players.

If you are interested in post-1945 Europe and want to develop a deeper understanding of what happened in Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Bulgaria and Romania during that fascinating year - then get this game.

I enjoy Twilight Struggle, even though I'm terrible at it, so I was really looking forward to this sort of sequel to it. It's strange that even though this was a period of time I actually lived through, I don't know much about the events around it. It feels a lot like TS, naturally, except for the weirdo scoring conflict bit that I really don't know how I feel about. It seems strange to me to have a lot of strategic play culminate in a separate card thinger which then determines a die roll. It seems oddly bolted on and incongruous. Still, I'd like to try it again and see if that part grows on me. Either way, I think I still prefer the original.

Still in development, but I was amazed by how some simple rules tweaks and a clever map layout was able to transform a game based heavily on Twilight Struggle in to something which looks similar but requires quite different strategy. I have a feeling that the random mechanics used in scoring here make the game a little on the chancy side, and the theme is overall less appealing than TS (even if it actually suits the base mechanics better) but otherwise this is shaping up to be a great alternative to TS fans who are growing jaded after repeat plays of the original.

Très proche de Twilight Struggle. S'apparente à une grosse variante. Plus asymétrique que TS, avec une sorte d'attaque/défense, mais qui fait sens par rapport au thème. Un joueur (démocrate) a plus d'événements favorables mais démarre la partie avec un énorme déficit de points de victoire (que si la partie va au bout des 10 tours). 
Sur ma seule partie j'y ai vu un rythme étrange avec des pays délaissés (jusqu'à l'approche du scoring final ?) car leur carte de score a été retirée de la partie (plus le fait d'en voir apparaître certaines pas avant la late war).
Le scoring est complexifié et influencé par l'ajout d'une résolution de "bataille" de cartes qui met en avant certaines cases du plateau (dans TS, sans situation géographique particulière, la plupart des pays "non-battleground" sont peut être un peu trop délaissés).
Une action fusionne coups d'état et réalignement (sans doute une bonne chose).
La piste Tiananmen qui remplace la course à l'espace avec des effets plus puissants, est moins contraignante sur la valeur des cartes et est un peu moins hasardeuse.

Revendu.

I liked this game.  Not as much as Twilight Struggle, although I think the scoring cards work better.  I am either the worst player in the history of the Communists, or I had really, really bad luck the first time.  Want to try again to see if I am really that bad.

Went a bit better, but still got smacked around, this time by my wife.  More abstract board but interesting in bringing out the feel of the era.

9/17:  A solo effort, and it went surprisingly well.  Might have thought the battle cards made it unplayable solo, but with some selective amnesia and trying to play the logical card, it worked well enough.  Not sure how often I would do it, but it got the game played after a four year hiatus.  It really is quite a good, overlooked game.

A great companion game to Twilight Struggle.  1989 comes with all the lessons learned from Twilight and some nice additions to game play.  Almost a different game.  The card play to see takes power is great fun and can yield some funny results (winning with 6 cards against 14 lol) The board is not random, certain power areas for communist and democrats are protected.  Scoring is a real interesting affair, similar but also quite different from Twilight.  Need more plays but right now its just as fun as TS.

Another GMT game that looked like Twilight Struggle and so persuaded me to buy it.  This game goes through the collapse of the Iron Curtain and the democratization across Eastern Europe; one player attempts to enact this rule of the people, while the Communist player is there to entrench his government as best he can.  The central theme being the fate of Eastern Europe's civilian population, there are multiple sorts of cards put into play (both historical event cards a la T. Struggle; but also protest and other thematic decks to help randomize outcomes).

I only brought this to table once, with my very sharp then-friend Kelli, in New Haven.  She trounced me as the democrats, and it was still a fun game.  Definitely not the lightest fare (it IS a GMT game, after all!) but a game worth setting aside a long evening for.  I look forward to getting this back to table with a like-minded nerd/friend, some time soon!

It’s a funny old world. Despite having Twilight Struggle as my only ‘10’ rated game I was never all that bothered about 1989. I guess I thought that unlike the Cold War, the fall of Communism in 1989 was something of a fait accompli and probably wouldn’t be worth gaming as the outcome would be too skewed towards to the democrats and against the communists. One of my new wargaming chums suggested that I might like this game and argued that it is actually a little more balanced than Twilight Struggle.

Anyway, I tried it out and really liked it. There looks to be a fantastic amount of depth and replayability here as well as some challenging decision making. Only one play so far, but I will definitely be back for more and will consider purchasing if I see it at the right price.

UPDATE:

Played again and really liked it. Will actively consider for purchase.

An interesting different take on the Twilight Stuggle mechanics. Feels like an uphill climb for the democratic power, as a scoring win that doesn't lead to the country leaving Soviet power leads to relatively neutral VP results due to power scoring for the Soviets.

Maybe I've been playing something incorrectly, but it seems to me that aftermath of Power Struggles are far too powerful if one can be removed from the battlegrounds of the country in question.

In my solo-game, the democrats played the Poland Scoring card for a second time. Raising the stakes. Winning with a Rally, +3 modifier with rolls of 6 and 1.

That meant removing 4 support-markers, which resulted in the communist player losing ALL control of battlegrounds and non-battlegrounds in Poland.

In turn the democrat player earned 6 points for domination vs. no presence. 6 points for 2 times played x 3. 2 points for battlegrounds controlled. 2 points for victory points rolled.
A total of 16 points for the democrats in one struggle and enough to win the game.

I don't know if this is normal, but I'll give it a few tries more, but it seemed heavy in favor of the democratic player.

Solo games: 2
Communist: 1
Democrates: 1

The above was read wrong. I tried again using the correct rules. This is no "Twilight Struggle" but its a good game.

Not a bad game.  I like Twilight Struggle better for the moment.  If I am being honest, it is probably because I got my ass kicked playing this game :) 

That being said, I really dislike the Power Struggle cards.  I do feel, objectively, this makes the game way too swingy. I will play this many more times,though.  It is important to pay attention to the periods when the scoring cards come out.  You will need to focus your attention on that.

I prefer this to its predecessor, Twilight Struggle, for a couple reasons. First, I like how the Power Struggles make scoring non-deterministic. Second, I like how the different types of locations both contribute some flavoring as well as an additional dimension of strategy, because of their effect on the Power Struggles. And finally, the topic of a political revolution captivates me more than the full scope of the Cold War.

RATING: 8
A more streamlined version of Twilight Struggle that I think hits the mark. It has the same randomness in the cards you get, and the same randomness in the Space Race aka Tiananmen Square track results. It introduces a bunch of new randomness in the scoring region resolution, adding a card edge battle a la Hannibal where you win if you can play a card that the opponent can't match, with die rolls to determine who leads next. And huge randomness with a critical one-off die roll (if the democrats win the edge) on whether the region even stays in the game for more scoring or not. That's a huge chunk of randomness. Yet ... I enjoy managing it all and seeing how it pans out, doing the best you can with what you get. I enjoy how the game is much more constrained than the TS world map ... you're really concentrating on a handful of areas, and as they're closed off, it allows you to focus on others instead. So the game feels tighter. Getting rid of the headline stuff was good - it just allows you to rip in each turn without fluffing around. Essentially, it's the same game, same experience, but I like the changes made. Having a historically important theme adds to the experience.

Quite similar to Twilight Struggle, however there is a little less going on so it plays faster.

Worth a try, but doubt I would ever own both games.

I asked for this on my Amazon wishlist in Christmas 2012 and to my surprise my parents bought it for me. A game of political control during the downfall of Communism in Eastern Europe in 1989, which I remember well as I was doing a course in Soviet Studies at the University of Essex at the time. The system is good and players must utilise their cards to spread influence while trying to nullify enemy events and showdowns as each country becomes ripe for revolution.

Great companion to Twilight Struggle and I love the "resurrection" of the "battle cards" (ala We The People and Hannibal) but in a different form.

Still, very good games in the CDG system.

Very similar to Twilight Struggle (same underlying board game rule system). 1989, though, focuses only on the end of the cold war. In a lot of ways, this game can be quite educational about this historical period. Game play is well balanced and pretty tense. I'd rather play Twilight Struggle, but I'll happily play this too as the gameplay is similar (good), but the experience and theme is still slightly different. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A re-implementation of the Twilight Struggle mechanics, although with a much more assymetrical feel to it - as the democrats you should always be on the offensive, while as the communist governments you are desperately trying to hang on. It is also innovative on how countries (Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and Romania - here functional equivalents to the regions in TS) are no longer scored as soon as the democrat ousts the communist player from power in them.

It doesn't quite reach the heights of TS, as the lack functional equivalents to the headline phase or DEFCON hampers the play of events somewhat and reduces tension. But an excellent game nonetheless.

1989 reveal the best of a CDG, an interesting theme that was well researched, mechanics give the game a very tense play, the adition of power struggle cards with the scoring bring a new and refresh game in with in the game it self.

I've had my eye on 1989: Dawn of Freedom for a while, being a huge fan of Twilight Struggle and finding the historical period fascinating. I've only had the chance to play it once so far, but it was a promising first impression. I liked that it was similar enough to Twilight Struggle to make learning it a breeze but different enough to make it interesting. The way they combined the coup and realignment actions into one works really well, and I love the mini-game Power Struggles when a scoring card is played. I need another game soon, now I know a few more of the things to look out for. You can certainly carry over some strategy from TS, but I suspect there's a lot that's different too.

I prefer this to Twilight Struggle, partly due to have a more focused and tangible theme, and partly due to the refinement of the rules. Unexciting mechanics are stripped away, and unexciting interactions made more lively with the addition of the personality cards. The uneven distribution of person types further deepens strategic choice (Minority Leaders vs. Bureacrats vs. Student Leaders, for example).

A game that owns its roots to Twilight Struggle. There is no quick ends (DEFCON or Wargames), so the game is a bit more relaxed. Also the absense of DEFCON makes starting the turn less important as you can always "coup". The absense of headline phase rids commies (and democrats also, but that is not as important in TS) from 2 consecutive actions. 

As the scoring cards act differently for the sides, the commies and democrats have distinctly different strategies (in TS both try to do basicly the same thing).

Ein „Twilight Struggle“-Klon, wiewohl man damit „1989“ nicht allein wegen des „Power Struggle“-Minigames kaum gerecht wird: Zwar geht es grundsätzlich auch um das Gewinnen oder Bewahren von „Einfluß“, die Ausgangspositionen beider Seiten sind aber grundverschieden: Während im „Early Year“ der „Kommunist“ noch diverse Asse im Ärmel hat, schlägt er mit Beginn des Jahresmitte primär Rückzugsgefechte und ist um Schadensbegrenzung bemüht. Außerdem kann es in „1989“ sinnvoll sein (und zwar für beide Kontrahenten), das eine oder andere Land aufzugeben. Insgesamt spielt sich „1989“ m.E. etwas schneller als „Twilight Struggle“, verzeiht allerdings u.a. deswegen auch weniger Fehler.

1989, a year of significance. Adopting the TS system with complete retheme into a communist-democratic confrontation. Seems that the unbalance between two sides are larger than TS. It took quite a long time for me to understand the difference between 'Hardliner vs Reformer' and 'East vs West'. I'm unfamiliar with the background of the game.(Why? Just check your Space Race Track), with no idea about the geography of East Europe, which is a bad impact to its rating.

RATING: 7
With a classic like Twilight Struggle as its chassis, one can hardly go wrong--and what is good about the earlier game is also good about 1989: the tense tug of war to cover the various territories before the scoring cards come out and the tough choices about how to use the opponent's events. 

The map is less intuitive (seeing as it contains classes and groups as well as cities), but you soon get used to this--one quickly works out what the strong and choke points are. Here, the innovation in coups (support checks), whereby proximity of controlled spaces affects the roll, adds to this, adding a further consideration to placement on the board. This is all good.

Less satisfying are the power struggles using the combat system from Hannibal. Often, they feel like a lot of faff when compared to the (few) decisions they involve and the (in my experience) normally somewhat predictable outcomes. Added to that, the key result--whether a country remains communist or not--is decided by a die roll anyway. I need to play more to see if my ambivalence about the power struggles is justified. 

All in all, a good variant on Twilight Struggle, which is beautifully produced to boot. However, if you haven't played or don't own either, then clearly TS is the essential game. This is more for enthusiasts who have played TS to death or those with a special interest in Eastern Europe. (I'm more of the second than the first).

For those who want a slightly more specific version of Twilight Struggle, you could do a lot worse. But I'm not sure it ever improves on the original. The Tianamen Square track feels like an oddly disconnected part of the narrative, and the little mini-game for revolutions is poorly integrated into the whole as well. That works for some games, but this one has a masterpiece to which it invites comparison, and it's not a flattering comparison at that. It's pretty good, but Twilight Struggle is so, so much better.

Having visited The Wall and travelled (with difficulty), through some of Eastern Europe in 1986 I remember following the events of 1989 with keen interest. Many of the names and events in the game I was familiar with and many I wasn't. So 1989 has proven to be not just a fun game, but also a fun educational experience. It's my sort of game, but I can see it's not going to appeal to everyone. Thankfully I have someone to play against who's also interested in the theme, so it's become a game I've been able to explore and become familiar with. The best sort of game for my taste.

I really like the Tiananmen Square track over the [i]Twilight Struggle[/i] Space Race track. The failure bonus, card bonuses and the different values for each side improves the system and enriches the theme.

Adapting the Hannibal: Rome versus Carthage battle card system leads to to nice tense battles that can throw up a few surprises. It also makes the players think more about which cities they'll try and control to get those leader cards working for you and not being dead weight, so that works very well integrating the cards with the board control.

A wonderful game. Sure, it uses the same system as [i]Twilight Struggle[/i], which makes it easier to learn for those used to the system, but it's obviously a completely different game with its own ebb and flow, story arch and style of play. Fantastic. It has a completely different feel to Twilight Struggle. 1989 has this feeling of the communist power being continually eroded. The Communist player is continually losing ground and that player might feel they're being continually beaten up, but what they're really doing is managing the pain. As such the two sides feel very different to play. The Democrat conversely is continually winning, with a few bumps along the way, but only at the end will they know if what felt like win after win is really going to be enough to get them over the line.

My two criticisms of the game (but only because I'm continually comparing it to Twilight Struggle), are that 1. the last two turns can be a bit processional if the remaining scoring cards come out early enough, and 2. There are too many dead events relying upon prerequisite cards to have effect. As such it doesn't have the same level of tension as Twilight Struggle.

I love this system and I love the improvements they've adopted with this game over Twilight Struggle. It's a great way to spend three hours. Both games are keepers for me.

Rating based on two-thirds of one play.  And, well, that's part of the problem -- four hours for six turns.  I'm a vet at [i]Twilight Struggle[/i], which itself is not a short game, but I don't think I need another 3-5 hour political tug-of-war game.  That said, I like the way support checks work (as opposed to coups or realignments in TS) especially that they emphasize the topography of the board.  I also quite liked how power struggles were resolved, being an exciting twist on the [i]Hannibal[/i] battle system.  The important differences between types of spaces is also interesting.  Overall, though, there is not much different here from TS, and since I am not as well-versed nor interested in the specifics of [i]1989[/i], I can't see wanting to play this very often, moreso given the length.

+ Power Struggles are mostly fun to play and offer a nice diversion
+ Nearly perfect implementation of the theme

- Power toppling is not decided by a Power Struggle itself, but by a single die roll afterwards
- Power Struggles begin to annoy after several occur in one turn
- Some (Power Struggle) wild cards like Support Falters are overpowered and annoying
- The game takes so much looonger than Twilight Struggle

I really like this one.  It feels smoother than TS did for me.  I think Support Checks (1989) and coups (TS) are the same thing ... but for some reason I understood the SC easier.  I like the fact that there is no defcon chart and no headline event.  I also think the Power Struggle adds an interesting flavor to the game.

Comparing to Twilight Struggle:

The Good: The country divisions make more sense than the continent divisions.  The annoying defcon track is gone.  The "card combat" resolution is interesting and provides more strategy.

The Bad: The event cards are not as interesting for this one year as compared to the entire 45-year global Cold War conflict.

The Ugly: As comparing "We the People" to "Washington's War", the additional "combat cards" can really slow the game down, but perhaps that was just my one game.

Another Matthews title that in my opinion is overhyped. I do like how there is the round of cardplay with the different symbols and it adds some intrigue, but I think that the democratic side has a huge advantage and it's pretty unbalanced that just doesn't make for a good game. I'd like to try it again and see if it affects my rating.

RATING: 10
1989 is similar enough to Twilight Struggle to dispel any doubts I might have had about whether I'd like it; I know that I like it a lot. The only question is whether I like it more than Twilight Struggle. 

The mechanical similarities are undeniable. As in Twilight Struggle, 1989 is full of back-and-forth tension. There's no mistaking the lineage.

At the same time, 1989 is different enough to justify its existence. Gone are coups and realignments, streamlined and consolidated into the hybrid support checks. No longer is scoring a simple counting exercise. Here, scoring cards initiate power struggles, which are clever mini-games unto themselves. Stability numbers are higher, but events are more powerful and therefore more destabilizing. Swings back and forth seem wilder. This game seems longer but more unpredictable.

Before I played 1989, I feared it might be overshadowed by its older brother. Those fears were misplaced. True, Twilight Struggle is [i]the[/i] sprawling historical narrative of the Cold War, but 1989 is no mere footnote. To some, anyway, it will be the [i]coup de grâce[/i], proof that the greatest stories are not always the grandest.

RATING: 7.5
1 play (Democrats)

Very interesting take of Twilight Struggle, with several VERY similar cards but also with many unique twists:
- still about the Cold War but concentrating on just one year. As such, it felt less epic in scope. It was quite an eventful year, of course, but I just don't remember all those little details so I felt less in touch with the theme! I should read some more about it, I guess.
- the East European countries (vs. continents) have "spaces" instead of countries. The spaces represent a variety of important groups: intellectuals, students, workers, religions, etc. The connections between them are largely ideological rather than geopolitical.
- no headline phase: I miss it! Communists are _always_ the first to do something each round, with no opportunity to mix things up every turn.
- Space Race changed to Tienanmen Square track, which is different: value of ops cards helps die roll, as does discarding your own event, and having failed an attempt before; advancement is different for each player (easier for Communists); bonuses are different, and pretty powerful!
- Coup and Realignment have sort of combined into a "Support Check" action. You still have a die roll, but always get 2 checks and always modify based on connected spaces
- Scoring Cards are much more involved, with more randomness and less certainty. 
... Scoring first triggers a Power Struggle: players draw battle cards (like Hannibal Rome vs. Carthage) based on their presence in the country, then play a little mini game. The more spaces you control, the more you draw -- incentive to spread far and wide (unlike TS where you need just enough). And here, the specific spaces you control might actually matter (other than just battleground vs. non-BG): they allow play of matching leader Power Struggle cards. Both changes are pretty cool!
... This could result in loss of influence (possibly with loss of control of some spaces!) for the loser, and some bonus VP for the winner.
... If Dems win, the card is removed from the game -- never scored again until final scoring!
... If the Communists win, they score bonus VP based on how many times they've managed to hold on to power.
... Finally, the usual country scoring (presence/dominance/control) is done -- reflecting the changes from the Power Struggle.
... All of this adds time to the length of the game.
- no Defcon track/suicide: players may coup (Support Check) with impunity! After one play, I'm not so crazy about that since it seems to add to the randomness of the game (by adding more dice rolls). Then again, we didn't really do it that often, being afraid of that die roll, so maybe it's OK?
- the events seem _really_ powerful, with many *d events that leave the game after being played. The neutral events, too, are quite strong! We ended up with some big swings, with one person then the other taking control of large areas.

There seems to be a general trend towards the fall of Communism over the course of the game (Middle deck especially has more Democratic cards than Communist). To balance the game play, the Commies are rewarded VP (maybe a lot!) for holding on to power as long as possible. The very asymmetric play style, though, seems well-balanced: in my game, we generally hovered near the 0 space of the VP track almost the entire time despite how the Dems slowly but surely freed the oppressed countries! Will this (nearly) always go the full 10 turns?

From a production standpoint, I prefer the simplicity of Twilight Struggle. The board is pretty to look at, but:
- there is too much color: it's difficult to see what is going on with just a quick look!
- the SP boxes are too large: the tokens don't fill the space, leaving room to wiggle and not covering up the little game setup reminders ... it's just not pretty!
- the Tienanmen track, off in one corner, is difficult to see even though you need to refer to it often to figure out what abilities are available to you. I didn't find all the little reminder chits very helpful -- easier to just leave cards near whatever the effect -- but it would have been nice having a set of counters for Tienanmen abilities to give to each player!
- where the heck are all these spaces?! This should get better with repeated play, but the lack of familiarity with the geography, the size of the board, and the number of spaces makes it difficult finding spaces! I wish the cards could have had a little map highlighting the general location(s) -- like in Ticket to Ride, for example.
- in the Power Struggle deck, why not make the suits different colors? You'd have to give everything a (white) border rather than print to the very edge, but it sure would be easier than having to look at the text or the symbols! And for the leaders, why not have an icon (at least in the upper left, but hopefully in the main art area as well) that indicates the leader type, rather than forcing you to read the text at the bottom of the card?!

Overall, the game play is very engaging: despite our 5 hours play time, we were never bored! Mostly, anyway: after the final scoring card has been played, you still have to play for end-of-game country scoring; but it's just not as exciting when you know no more scoring cards are coming up! That could happen as early as turn 7, though more likely 8-10. Also, 5 hours is quite a long time for this game; hopefully that comes down with repeated play. I LOVE Twilight Struggle. This is a nice change of pace, although not quite as good as TS: longer play time, less tension, more chaos (events and dice rolls), worse production. The many interesting changes (to coups/realignment, Space Race, scoring, etc.), though, will certainly bring me back to this again and my initial rating (7.5) could easily improve.

RATING: 6
Good game, but it does not de-throne Twilight Struggle. It does a few things better, a few things worse. Given that both games compete for the same space, Twilight Struggle comes out as the winner. If 1989 was a 90 minute game, it would be a keeper but it's only *slightly* shorter than a full game of Twilight Struggle.

This has a lot of promise going for it, but I feel that it suffers from being far less balanced and far more luck dependent than Twilight Struggle, its predecessor. While both sides could win Twilight Struggle, it seems as if 1989 is heavily stacked in favor of the Communist player from the very beginning. Whilst I would certainly not object to playing again, it seems to have more chaos, and less strategy than TS and hence, less replayability.

RATING: N/A
The game is alright until the power struggle happens. I don't like it. Other than that, which is relevant enough, the game plays fluently but a bit opaque, specially with all the symbols on the cities and the number of times we have to check the map to understand where one can play. 
The theme is really interesting for someone like me that remembers a lot about those times. 
A remake of twilight struggle with some of its issues but unlike the later much less envolving. Maybe because of the constant search for everything in the map.

Sure, all they basically did was take the Twilight Struggle system and add the battle card mechanism from Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage, and then put a little twist on the Space Race track. But what drama that adds, what an extra layer of subtle tension. A good deal longer than TS in my few playings, and some will feel there was no point in adding anything to the sleek basics of the parent game.

Rich and gut wrenchingly tense. The violent swings thematically correct - game play wise means you are living of knife edge and need to treat them as twin impostors. I like the Power struggle despite the time it  adds - really adds tension and again fits with theme. Better than TS? I think I prefer TS but this is truly fabulous

I think this has every 2 player game award for 2012 sewn up.

:thumbsup: LIKE
+ The blending of coup and realignment into support checks and having to make triangles to reinforce the spaces you control.
+ Tiananmen track is like a upgraded Space track from TS.
+ Spaces associated with a icon makes for interesting card play and diversification in power struggle (leaders).
+ The communist having power in all region at the beginning, forcing the democrat to remove them ; highly thematic.

:thumbsdown: DISLIKE
- Power struggle ; I like the idea of it, but the actual resolution is tedious.  I don't like the game within a game aspect of it.  It really breaks the tempo of the game.
- The removal of DEFCON and military tracks from TS makes 1989 a game that's a lot less tense.
- With no limit on gameplay, you often see back and forth on some spaces until somebody runs out of cards.
- Art design (cover box, cards back, iconography, some colors choice, etc.) and misprints/mistakes on the board and cards.  It's about time GMT hires a competent art designer and somebody to proof read before print.

:star: VERDICT
Different enough from Twilight Struggle that it's worth to play ; it's just missing the tension and come backs from TS.  The theme is a little far from home, but it makes for an interesting history lesson.  I would consider this a nice introduction to CDG before moving on to TS.

After one play, this game promised to be just as good, but certainly not better than it's brother Twilight Struggle.  The only struggle with getting this to the table, is having to teach people, when they already know Twilight Struggle, so they always say, why not just play that instead?  If it saw the table more, I could see it bumping up to a ten.  The thing that keeps it back at the moment is my lacking of understanding the genuine strategy in power struggles.

Card-driven political strategy game from the same mould as 'Twilight Struggle'. Like 'TS', the main principle is relatively simple, namely one side takes the democrats and the other plays as the communists, and both attempt to place enough influence in different areas of the board before scoring occurs. Cards can be played as either operations points, allowing you to directly place influence markers into a region, or can allow you to perform support checks, which are an attempt to remove your opponents' influence, or they trigger an event based on historical occurrence. How to best play your cards is the most engaging aspect of the game and is certainly less apparent than it is in 'TS'. One area of gameplay that differs from 'TS' is the playing of power struggle cards during scoring and these introduce an added level of tension as players jostle to improve their situation and maximise the points available for them. This is a highly impressive game built on the foundations of one of the greatest games ever created. It definitely merits its place as a game in its own right because like 'TS' it wonderfully captures a moment in history and incorporates one of the most tense and immersive gaming experiences within it.

An excellent but very heavy two player game. The asymmetric gameplay is cleverly devised with the communist player trying to hang on to his power as long as possible while the democratic attempting to free as many countries as soon as possible - the final scoring always benefits the communist. The conflict resolution is cleverly designed with a little die rolling - so you cannot be sure whether all is lost/gained until the very end. The major reason why it is only an 8 and not a 9 or a 10 is its length. The game often takes half a day to finish which is just too long for us. The other possible con is that the very beginning of the game with the Early Years deck can feel a little too samey after several games but adding the extra decks will mitigate this later. Can recommend to anyone who is looking for a heavy two player game with exquisite historic theme.

To make it short: what's missing here is all the thrill and the suspense of Twilight Struggle. Being an abstract power like socialism or democracy isn't as enthralling as leading a palpable superpower. Unfortunately the cards provide less background information as in Twilight struggle, which also contributed a lot to the theme. The research that went into this game is just as amazing as it was in TS - why not go the extramile and make it more apparent on the cards? My gaming buddy didn't recognize Günther Guillaume for example and who can blame him? Don't know how many faces of history I can't put names to... Another part I did not enjoy is the tricktacking mechanics of the power struggles for reasons I don't know. Maybe I just don't like mixing in Tricktaking into the "Twilight Struggle"-engine. And then I have the feeling there are too many cards which make you roll the dice.

After all,I don't see why I should ever play this again when I could play TS instead. Our first session lasted approximately 5 1/2 hours and was resolved by the final scoring. And it felt pretty dull especially when compared with its predecessor.

I love games that replay history and this one is about a point in time I very actively remember - being the year right before my military service. The thing that makes me a bit sad about it is the still english board (they provide a translation help, but come on, it's not hard to print boards) and more noteably the many errors in the rule book (grammar, orthography, using the wrong words). This was supposed to be a translation done by a german publisher. You would expect they know what to write in a rule book ...

I enjoyed this print-and-play sequel to Twilight Struggle, designed by Ted Torgerson (who also designed the amusing Sharks and Jets, a West Side story retheming of Advanced Squad Leader). This is a card-driven game with many similarities to Twilight Struggle, but with a new board and a new set of cards, along with a handful of new mechanics. It is unsurprisingly set in 1989 and simulates the fall of communism in Eastern Europe. As the game description explains, the game "covers events from the election of Solidarity in Poland through the Velvet Revolution in Czechoslovakia and the fall of the Berlin Wall." I think it's well worth checking out, especially for fans of Twilight Struggle, and I think the game has plenty of differences from Twilight Struggle to make it worthwhile as a separate entity in its own right. The game integrates a Hannibal-style combat mechanism for resolving scoring cards, which is a particularly intriguing twist. I am looking forward to playing it again and further exploring the many detailed cards that Ted devised for this obvious labor of love.

Played our first game yesterday

Since we have played Twilight Struggle, this was very easy to pick up.

The game feels a bit the same as TS but with some interesting extras like the struggle deck.  

Area to control in the board 'seems' smaller and the game 'seems' quicker once you have it down so you don't quite get the epic feel like TS.

Basically the USSR is collapsing and you are trying to stem the tide to hold off the inevitable as the Russians - some may not like that feel but to us it was a lot of fun.

Think now that we have it down it will be a pretty quit game (compared to our TS games) and I may like it better than TS - only time and more plays will tell.

Our game lasted 4-5 hours and started to get long in the tooth - if we could get it to the 3 hour range it would be perfect.

Yes, it's this good. Yes, it's different than Twilight Struggle. And yes, the differences are thematically relevant and genuinely creative. And yes, stick with the card fight when scoring a country even with its outlier luck potential, it falls into place with the value of board position beautifully. More dramatic swings than TS.

With the specificity of the history & gorgeous production, this may even be better than Twilight Struggle. Intelligentsia! Students!

"History punishes those who come too late." - Mikhail Gorbachev

1989: Dawn of Freedom is an exciting, fast paced game simulating the end of the Cold War in 1989. During this amazing year, a series of democratic revolutions ended the 40 year Soviet empire in Eastern Europe. 1989 simulates the political, social and economic aspects of these revolutions using a card-driven system similar to Twilight Struggle.

"No man is so old he cannot live one more year." - Leszek Kolakowski

One player plays the Communist. At the start of the game he holds unquestioned power across the six nations of the Warsaw Pact. But there are ominous clouds on the horizon. The new leader in Moscow has declared no more will Soviet tanks prop up tottering Communist governments. The economies, after decades of central planning and stagnation, have reached various stages of crisis. Inside the churches and among the students and their professors there are dissident movements that have been emboldened. From crushing dissent to offering concessions, the Communist player will have to use a variety of strategies in a struggle to hold on to his empire.

"A bad regime is never in so great danger as when it tries to improve." - Alexis de Tocqueville

The other player plays the Democrat. At the dawn of 1989, behind the iron curtain, no one considers revolution possible. The goal of dissidents is to create a civil society outside the control of the Communist regimes. On their side are students who are fascinated with the style and pop culture of the west, and the Church. Against them is the vast apparatus of the Communist state. Their challenge is to persuade the workers, who are the bulk of society, to join their cause.

Preliminary rating based on solo play. May take me a few weeks to get this lined up for some ftf. I feel it may go up after we drive it a few times.

I wasn't interested in this game at all during it's development due to my feelings about TS. Based the purchase on a chance interaction with designer Ted T. (yes... I'm that shallow)

I love the topic.... I love the fact that 1989 (IMO) has much more chrome then I thought it would, and I love the power struggle prior to the scoring of countries. Outstanding components.

Evolução espiritual do Twilight Striggle. Apesar de ter algumas características melhores, como a Tiananmen Square e as cartas mais equilibradas, no geral perde um pouco para o original, principalmente pela nova mecânica de cartas Power Struggle (a ideia é boa, mas acabou adicionando uma complexidade e uma dose de sorte extra desnecessária ao jogo) e por causa da temática (acontecimentos históricos, locais, etc), não tão comum a nós quanto a Guerra Fria, tornando o jogo menos empático.

I'm probably being too harsh, but the game feels like a mashup of two games I would always prefer to play. 1989 is far too dependent on die rolls and the length is unjustified. 

The support checks are much more elegant than the coup/realignment mechanic and the factions within countries being a place to allocate support works well, but the trick-taking power struggle element deviates from the theme (instead of augmenting it as in Hannibal) while needlessly adding to the games length. 

There are some great design elements here, but for my taste, the end result is too long and swingy without being much fun. If a fan of TS and Hannibal doesn't like this game, who on earth is it intended for?

This game is as amazing as its older sibling, Twilight Struggle. 1989: Dawn of Freedom is not simply a re-themed Twilight Struggle. Although it shares many mechanisms with its precursor, the cards in 1989 are more powerful, as a rule, but mainly starred - one off events. TS's coup and realignment mechanics have been merged into Support Checks (2 die rolls per card adjusted by the control of neighbouring spaces) and there's no Defcon, so you can pound away at battlegrounds or otherwise at will. The space race is now the Tiananmen Square Track with more powerful effects but with no VP awards. Finally, the biggest difference is the Power Struggle which occurs when a scoring card is played. This adds both uncertainty and charm to the game.

Overall, well done Ted and thanks!

Too long. I take quick turns but the person I play it with has some analysis paralysis and the game can take then 4 hours which leaves me completely exhausted. 

The beginning of the year is fun, in the middle the excitement starts to wear off and by the end of the year I just want it to end finally; and when it does I feel higher satisfaction that it ended already rather than from who won the game. It should not be like that.

The game would be better off if it lasted 8 turns rather than 10.

One play:  Democrats seized power in Poland in the first turn, but other than that, the Communists dominated the power struggles winning two in Hungary, one in Czechoslovakia, and two in East Germany.  The second East German power struggle is the first card play on turn 8 and pushes the Communists to their 20 point autowin.

This is an interesting tweak to the Twilight Struggle system.  I like that coups and realignments have been replaced with support checks because it's more streamlined (and I never know when to realign).  The power struggle process makes for some interesting decisions (raising the stakes for instance), but does add some time to the game.  We'll see if it's a net positive over time.  There seemed to be a lot of event culling, but that might have been due to our lack of familiarity with the game.

Overall, a fun first play.  I'm glad I bought it.

Good follow up to Twliight Struggle, a bit lower on complexity, but the power struggles make up for the loss of complexity with a mini-game inside the game

Twilight struggle is better for us, because the map of 1989 takes some looking into.

Played this with my wife and we enjoyed it. She doesn't like playing really long games but this one went okay. I'm actually surprised she didn't walk away from the experience saying anything negative about it other than not being able to feel she was in full control since opponent events still get played. I agree with her opinion. (copied/pasted from my Twilight Struggle comment).

We definitely noticed a change in play from Twilight Struggle. The country scoring seemed to have more of a noticeable effect because either the Communist player gets a lot more VPs or the Democrat player essentially prevents those VPs from occurring in the future. This was more noticeable, I'm sure, due to the fact a scoring card was played in the first turn. Even though there's no Military Actions or DEFCON tracks, it's pretty good at holding tension due to scoring results. Having a mini-game to determine the winner of scoring was kind of interesting...if one person has the upper hand it almost seems pointless. It was enjoyed for the most part, but we definitely prefer Twilight Struggle.

Worthy Twilight Struggle variant.  New mechanics add some interesting twists.  Great tense historical game.  Game seems to be balanced.

1989 succesfully combines mechanisms from Twilight Struggle and Hannibal. New strategies are there to be discovered by veteran TS players. There is more asymmetry and the map features more choke points. The choice of theme is wonderful; it's nice to play events you remember watching from tv news as a teen. There is plenty of darkish humor to be found, especially in the captions of the cards. Hand management is tense as always, even if there are a great number of "remove from game after event" cards. Country Scoring and Power Struggle VP values could use some tweaking.

Will hold of my score till after I've played at least 2-3 full games. 

After the first game did get some idea on the Power struggle mechanic and the differences from TS, but not quite well for now.

Same game as Twilight Struggle.  Not as highly rated since I have little interest in the subject and it is just more of the same with minor rules tweaks and a new skin.

It's very similar to Twilight Struggle, sharing most major mechanics. The big difference is the Power Struggle mechanic, which is fun but not game-defining. It replaces the Space Race/Defcon mechanics. I prefer TS because I played it first, but both are fun games to play.

This is a less interesting derivative for Twilight Struggle. As the topic is less known than the Cold War it is harder to understand what is going on. In the end the theme appears somewhat pasted on, or if it is the other way around. Experienced players routinely clean the clock of any newcomers as it is rather counterintuitive to find out the best strategies.

Just edges TS as my favorite "political" CDG. Has more emphasis on going after more than just battlegrounds, which adds an extra layer of strategy during the power struggles. With the potential of removing scoring cards, there's also the element of figuring out when to bail in a country. Great design!

This is like Twilight Struggle but with big changes. You'll not be held back by threat of losing to thermonuclear apocalypse. Thematically this makes obviously sense. And you loose some control because of the lack of a defcon mechanism. In gameplay terms it feels like a lot of interesting mechanisms and strategical play has been lost. So how does 1989 make up for the lack of this? 

Well, there's just a wholly different dynamic to 1989: 
 
A combination of coup and realignment into one roll called support checks. You get 2 checks for each card. You're never really safe unless you surround yourself or you set up in high stability countries. It's still hard to get into certain regions. And there aren't many unstable spaces.  

You also want to take other locations than the usual battlegrounds, because they give you support of certain classes. 

A power struggle card system is put into place mirroring the battlemechanic cardplay in Hannibal. Here the support of the classes becomes important. 

The communist player can give up on / or lose regions because the scoring card may/can be put out of play. If a region is won by the communist he gets extra points based on the number of times the region is already scored. 

The tienanmen square replaces the space race for you to dump cards in. Instead of VP it gives you abilities until your opponent catches up or gives you a one time use. 


In conclusion. 1989 feels like a game that borrowed a lot from the gameplay systems of legendary game titles and took a decent shot at and also succeeded at creating a very good and balanced area control game with these elements, respecting the historical roots of its theme. I definately would recommend it to anyone who likes to play something about this period. Yet it does not live up to the magic of all the fluently combined systems of TS, but that in itself would be very difficult to achieve.

It takes the card-driven system of Twilight Struggle and the maneouver-card system similar to Hannibal: Rome v Carthage and places it all onto the theme of the tumultuous year at the end of the Cold War.  Great game!  Absolutely great game, and I wish I could play it more often.

GAME: The World Cup Card Game 2010
RANK: 4681
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Ratings based on 1 play with 2 players.  It was fun and would be more fun with 3 or 4 players I think - more might not be so great.
2 players made it quite a tight tactical game.
It is more random than the board game version.
Germany won.

Update: played again with 3.  More fun. I think four might be the optimal number, especially if you allocated one team in each group each.
Denmark won this one.

Quite good fun while the World Cup was on but I'm not sure it will have much lasting impact (actually I went off it totally when Australia won the world cup!)

RATING: 6
Unfortunately not as good as the board game version which I personally find much better. This is mainly confined to the group stages whereby all the groups are carried out individually. With larger player numbers, this means sitting out for periods where you are not in that group and it is much easier to progress your teams since you do not need to divest your cards as much.

RATING: 8
A fun and easy to play/teach game, based mostly on luck.
Sometimes it overstays its welcome, taking around 90 minutes to play. 
It cannot be considered a filler, based on its playing time.
A game for everybody, not just for football (soccer) geeks.
You definitely need a scoring sheet, so that you don't have to write all the result/standings on paper.

A whole load of down time at the beginning if you had no team in a group, so we abandoned and moved on.  However another group seemed to be having a hoot with it, so maybe we were missing something?  Would try again if I could find someone who will play!

RATING: 7
Very fun simulation of the World Cup.  My son is nuts about this.  Like any card game, the luck of the draw counts for a lot.  But with decent hand management skills you can often turn luck in your favor.

UPDATE:  Still like this, but I don't play it enough.  I never seem up to the task of re-reading the rules -- there is some complexity -- and going through the setup of organizing a tournament.

RATING: 8
Another great game from Shaun. It has all the tension of the Board Game. One of my friends actually prefers having the focus on a single group at a time. I think that you have less control making it a little bit more random than the Board Game. On a final stages penalty and attack we allow the player to cut the deck and then flip effectively choosing there own destinys. You can't complain though as the price for this is great, easy to teach and can be taken almost anywhere. 7 Plays
Winners so far - 1 for England, Netherlands, France, Cameroon, Portugal, Paraguay and Slovakia

RATING: 5.5
More of an experience than an actual game. You have very limited choices you can make, and there is a lot of chance to what you get given, and what your opponent plays. I did really well, getting 2 of my teams into the final, guaranteeing me first and second place. I'd play it again. Maybe once a year. Fun with the right people. I really didn't notice that the game took as long as it did, because I was enjoying the company so much, but that probably was in spite of the game.

Good fun - probably works best with 4 and makes sure everyone gets one team in each of the groups at the group stage, plus that everyone gets 2 of the seeded teams.

I would like to see an expansion to provide cards for all world teams and a generic assignment of groups stage cards and 1/2/3 goals allowed value, so that you could play any world cup (past or future).

Fun filler game. The only drawback is that it takes too long and it is high on luck factor.
But you feel like you actually achieved something when Greece wins Germany in the semi-final (even if it was because of a better card draw!)

I've played a lot of this card game of the Easter School Holidays with my son and his friends as well as with a few gamers.

The game is great fun and people are involved  throughout the game, but especially in the 1st Round stage, that is except with 5 or more people. It is all too easy to not be involved in a round or two and then I found peoples attention wandered and their liking of and for the game also diminished.

2 - 4 seems to be the sweet spot for this game, which plays quickly and is easy to grasp. Great value and the time passes very quickly while playing (as long as not playing with 6 or more players!)

Download the score sheets and look at the FAQ at publishers web site to clear up some of the "what if" and "how to" questions that will arise especially during the knock out stages.

If you like this game, youshould try out the board game - the balance seems better, but upsets can still happen.....

OMG!!! This game is so great!!! Very very exciting! Especially if you're going into a penalty shoot-out!

And it's has strategy involved as well in the knock-out stage.

It is highly recommended to both football fans and non football fans. Very great party game! And it's fun with even only two players, too!

Update: May 12 2010, played 3 times, didn't win any of them. But I still love this game very very much!!

A clever, fun design that rates teams for the 2010 World Cup, yet remembers that it's a game--with random draw elements that allows anyone to have a chance to win. In that sense, it's not to be taken too seriously, as, unlike the World Cup itself, this is just a game. That is, I would think many serious football fans probably aren't going to like the randomness of card draws or the relative simplicity of this game--or even the ratings of some of the teams. But it seems to me that it cleverly accomplishes what it sets out to do--allows people to play out a World Cup based on some basic team ratings and with a reasonable amount of randomness in generating outcomes, while allowing players to make some decisions about when and how to play cards. In the group play rounds, each player gets 7 or 8 cards, which must be apportioned through all 3 games. That's where strategy comes in--deciding when and where to play cards, depending on the perceived strength of an opponent. In the knockout round and quarter-finals, each player initially gets 3 cards to use for the teams he owns, and players draw from a draw deck and play from 1-4 cards as if it slots, with certain cards being able to cancel others out. In the semi-finals and finals, play proceeds in a similar manner to the knockout and quarterfinals, but with a more limited draw deck. There are some problems with underwritten rules (the game comes in a standard-size card deck box, so perhaps that's an inherent limitation), but references to BGG can clear up questions without too much difficulty, particularly since the designer has been good about jumping in to answer questions. This will not be everyone's cup of team, but personally I say "bravo" and "thanks" to the designer for creating a quick-playing, enjoyable game that doesn't forget it's a GAME while providing team ratings that may affect eventual outcomes. In my first two plays, solo or with my 11-year-old son, Italy and then Argentina won. In the latter replay, North Korea finished second, sneaking under the radar through all rounds with fortuitous card draws and plays. Purchased through Canadian on-line company, June 2010, one day before World Cup 2010 started.

RATING: 4
Deal out all the teams to the players. Randomly allocate 7 or 8 action cards to each team, and use those cards to play 3 games. A game is to allocate between 1 and 4 cards to each team that will score goals or cancel goals in various ways. It's simultaneous revelation, so it's not an interesting mechanic or decision ... just random. You're trying to win your games to get your teams into the knockout rounds, and then it's more of the same with variations on how you receive cards, moving to a "play 1, draw 1" type thing. But it's all a bit of a slog, and it doesn't find any more excitement along the way. The good news is that it's a perfect game for a 10 year old boy who loves recreating football tournaments, which has been done via dice in the past and now he's got another option (easy enough to roll a d4 and allocate that many cards to a team to simulate a game result). So it's worked out well in that way (as I knew it would), otherwise it'd be seeing plenty of shelf time.

There's not a lot to it and it takes over an hour, but I didn't feel it outstayed its welcome at all. If you're a football fan, it's just really fun playing the games out and filling in the chart. Inevitably, Germany knocked England out on penalties, Brazil shockingly dropped out at the group stage, and the final was a 5-1 win for Italy. The only real problem is that the rules that come with the game have a serious error in the procedure for semi-finals and finals, which took a lot of tension out of the end our game. See the games page for a correction by the designer.

Traded away 10/10 as the world cup is over now!

The rules that come with the game don't make sense.
So I downloaded extra docs from BBG, they also don't make sense! This must be a game for the serious fan because its just not intuitive.

Ok, it just sucks because I can't understand the rules!

Worst than that, no videos explaining game play!
Maybe if I was on a desert isle I would persevere, but I'm not and so I won't.

A little card game, but it takes over 2 hours to play.  Tons of luck involved, and better teams don't have much of an advantage over horrible teams.  It does have exciting moments as players turn cards to score goals.  Odd card playing mechanics really annoy me as a soccer fan because you can play card on games you don't even have a team in!  Foul!

A [i]"late night with the right crowd"[/i] type game. Too long for what it is. Felt a bit odd to have blind bidding in the first round before switching to card play like the boardgame in later rounds. Hugely dependent on both the cards you draw, and the whims & loyalties of other players. We also seemed a bit short of cards for attack/penalty resolving at times, but maybe we need to check the rules.

RATING: 3
The World Cup Game 2010 has two phases:  blind-bidding, then relative influence.  The margins are as tight as a real soccer match, which makes it very dependent on card draws.  The tiebreakers ignore the players altogether!  Strategy distills down to which games to sacrifice.  This lasts an hour longer than it should, but sports fans will enjoy the statistics.

RATING: 8
Nice implementation of this system, slightly quicker than the board game.  The group stage doesn't really work with only two people so if playing with two I recommend skipping straight to the knockout rounds with the best teams.  With four people, however, the simultaneous reveal of cards in the group stage worked very well indeed and is recommended.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Much better than its full-board counter part. Faster and more fun, considering the small package and limitations of a card game. It do takes into consideration the history of the teams to make some better than others and there are randomness throughout: from the distribution of teams to the draw of cards. But, as I mentioned, the matches are fast and furious.

Easy to teach and to learn. Would play this over the board version anytime.

Tries to be similar to the board game. Only 32 playing cards in the deck, so group stage is played one group at a time, and round of 16 has to be split in two parts. I'm thinking of a variant that uses only half the teams for shorter game.

A nice diversion until an expansion comes out for the 2010 WC.  The teams are somewhat rated on the cards as they restrict the amount of 1, 2, or 3 goals that may be played on certain teams.  Plays fast and it's fun, but nothing to rave on about.  Got mine direct from the publisher at a reasonable price including shipping to the US.

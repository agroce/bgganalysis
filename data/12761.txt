RATING: 7
Semi-blind placement game with market manipulation, and multiple ways to score.

Essentially an area control game, with a market manipulation aspect (re: Reef Encounter, Princes of the Renaissance, etc.), that involves placement of two markers each round, one face-up, one face-down (semi-blind).  Allows for alot of bluffing/second-guessing, as markers are placed in neighbourhoods for majorities, the market for manipulation of the gems value, and initially for turn-order and tie-breaking conditions.

Scoring can be accomplished by winning one of the 3 regions in a neighbourhood (minor points), by placement in the market (very minor points), by obtaining some of the power cards (minor), by obtaining the valuable black gems (major), and by having majorities in the different colours of gems, which are determined by the market (very major).

It's a very good game, strategic with a guessing element, but personally I can't rate the game higher due to the market aspect.  The whole game can be won or lost in the last turn of the game due to the market and the whims or suspected whims of other players- while I've won each time I've played this game, I'm not a big fan of games with this aspect, especially when it's so significant to the overall game.

Own the [boardgame=19652]Ys+[/boardgame] expansion.

I like this one.  It seems pretty deep to me and there seems to be quite a few eqaul(ish) paths to victory.
What hits you first, though, is the awfully written rules!  They keep going on about draws in almost every small section, instead of telling you at the end (and in one place) how those are resolved.  This is certainly one of those games that it would much better to get someone who's knowledgeable to explain.  Otherwise it appears very muddy to start with.

Having said all of that, but the time you've got one game under your belt, you'll be starting to appreciate that there is a fair bit involved in working out how to win it.  And I do like the fact that, like Perikles, it's very hard to see who's winning until right at the end.

The way the value of the gems works out reminded me a little of Emerald - and in fact some of the card art is similar, too.  On the subject of the card art, though - why oh why don't Ystari put a ship on the ship cards somewhere?  A minor point perhaps, but this just emphasises the abstraction of the game instead of a possible injection of a small amount of theme.

I can understand why folks compare this to Aladdin's Dragons. I think this game is more complex, but Aladdin's Dragons has the edge on fun.  Both are sufficiently different for anyone to want to own and play.

From the Review: Partial blind bidding without loads of luck and and interesting theme make this interesting. Plays 2-4 in a little over an hour. The price of gems fluxuate. This game looks like there is some thinking to it and could be prone to AP meltdowns.

Rating after a number of plays.  Nice concept and flow to this game.  It's very easy to teach new players and the only hangup is with the character cards (And the graphic on them does a good job of indicating their use).  The game gains some character with the use of craft store gems of the bag 'o gems availible from the publisher.  If you like commodities trading, fluctuating stocks, and/or speculation, YS won't displease you.  If you are not a fan of some player created chaos, stay away.  I for one, like YS quite a bit and am glad to have it in my collection.

(1 play, 4 player) Not sure how I'll feel after  second play.  I liked the one up, one down bidding thing, as well as the marketplace grid... but the whole thing may be too much, you know?  Lots of maneuvering and second-guess, some chaos in the cards, but ultimately it just felt like a longer, more fiddly Basari, a game I'd MUCH rather play.  Heck, you could maybe play TWO games of Basari (or Edel, Stein, & Reich) in the time it takes to play Ys.

Los jugadores personifican a príncipes comerciantes de Ys. Hábilmente usando su red de corredores, especulan en la compra de piedras preciosas de modo de  conseguir oro. En cada vuelta, las naves llenas de gemas desembarcan en los puertos de la ciudad. Para obtener gemas, provocar la subida de los precios de mercado y pueda obtener cartas, los jugadores debe conseguir las mayorías en el tablero colocando corredores en lugares cuidadosamente elegidos. Los corredores pueden ser colocados boca arriba o boca abajo, lo que permite hacer dudar a los contrincantes.

Perfectly fine game which didn't do a lot for me.  In theory, the half-blind bidding sounded like an interesting change to me.  In practice, I found the game to feel almost exactly like regular old blind bidding.  I think most of the mechanisms save black cubes (the more a player has the less incentive there is to block them) are well-designed, but I don't think the game is very interesting or fun, or that it would warrant more than a 45 minute playtime.  I definitely prefer Aladdin's Dragons.

I was duly impressed by the game play.  I've played with a house variant that limits the board size to 1 less than the number of players.  This variant definitely tightens the game, but it is not required for the game to be really good.  The game play merges area influence with blind (mostly) bidding.  The bidding is half-blind actually as players place some of the tokens face down (hidden) while the remainder are face up.  This results in less chaotic feel as the players have some idea about what the other players are doing.  There are several good mechanics in this and it is clear that Ystari has a solid game with this title.  The expansion is hard to find but does add some nice features.  Some claim that the expansion is required for the best game experience, but that is a bit of an over statement.

Played once.  This one will snap some neurons in the process of deciding where to place bids.  A lot to think about and left me a bit drained at the end of the game even though it doesn not play that long... and that's a good thing.  Will have to play more before rating.

A more sophisticated version of Aladdin' Dragons.  Whilst it lakes AD's excitement it provides a complementary deeper more strategic alternative.

I enjoyed this a lot.  As only half the dobbers are hidden the placing is subtler than in Aladdin%u2019s Dragons, which seems to add to the bluffing element.  Whilst it lacks AD's excitement, it provides a complementary deeper more strategic alternative.  Being able to influence the relative values of the gems adds a new dimension.  Being start player and consequently winning tie breaks was a strong option.  Good fun.

Additions owned include 5th player expansion, new character cards and mini gem stones.

Probably just as good as Aladdin's Dragons in terms of design, but in practice, I think Aladdin's Dragons in more approachable in theme and approach. While I enjoyed the market driven aspect of the game, I don't think it would play well with most non-gamers. Definitely has a Ystari feel to it.

Played once as a 4-player game and once as a 2-player game.  Ys is pretty good, but not great, so it rarely gets played.  I do enjoy trying to mislead my opponents with my blind broker placements.  However, Ys also feels more abstracted from reality than most other games, so there is a real disconnect for me.  Perhaps I need to read the game description in the rules to have a better understanding of what the game is trying to represent.

4 round Merchant game with hidden tactics. The merchants in this town work their deals in a sneaky and probably quite suspicious way. Each player start with a predetermined number of merchants they have to place each round. It keeps an intricate system on how to cheat your fellow merchants out of goods on the incoming ships or different areas of the city aswell as holding an added market place where the winner each round can decide which good will become more or less valuable. 

It has a great deal of elements in it's gameplay but turn out simple enough once started. It is however not alltogether easy to read your opponents moves.

Played once. I am not a fan of blind bidding. I have a hard time deciding what to write here, the game seemed almost themeless, and it had blind bidding which I usually hate, but I feel that I would play it again. I am not sure I would play it a lot, however. My rating is quite tenuous and will likely change if I get the chance to play again soon.

Update: Played again. It didn't get any better. I changed my rating to a 5. Not very pleasant.

First Play: Inc expansion for the 1st play. With 5 new players we struggled badly with the rules and when we came out the other side we found the game to be very straight forward. Why did the rules need to be so ungainly? In one case we needed to read the french rules to identify what the English veersion was trying to say.

But, this seems to be a well balanced deep thinking game. Well received around the table with lots of decisions to make, I look forward to my next game.

PS: Two packs of broker tokens were heavily stained with fungi spores especially the cut out for the number. Cleaning didn't remove the dirty marks and so the anonimity of the downturned token is revealled once players get to know my set. However these were promptly replaced by the publisher 10/10 for service.

Nice blind bidding game. Players are Ys merchant princes that try to gather gems and change their market value to earn as much as possible at the game end. Good production quality.
Two aspect I hope will be fixed are the market that is quite static after the first value setting: people prefer to use resources to gather more valuable gems and not to increase the value of th few they have. Is a better tactic. Second, there is not enough diffirence between the black gems and the +3 victory points bonus.

Talk about yer pasted on themes! What the hell? You place "brokers" into sections of town to try and win powers, money, or gems. I can appreciate the mechanics of this game and all the tie-breaker stuff. But in my hearts of hearts, this one instills a powerful brand of CUBE CONFUSION. I'm beginning to think Ystari is the Euro game poster child for that most debilitating of gaming diseases, yes again, Cube Confusion. This one makes Ra look like it's dripping with theme. Funny thing is there's like the whole story that's included in the rule book. I had to laugh. I felt like a spoiled actor, "ok, what's my motivation?" I couldn't find it. I'm starting to have an aversion to any game that asks me to impersonate some white collar worker from a bygone era. Yuck!

I really like this game. Awesome board. Practically everything you do affects two aspects of the game. I'm not crazy about blind bidding, but the half-blind bidding in this game is great. Works well with 3-4. The "2-player" game isn't really (there's a fake third player shared by both real players--I *hate* that). If everyone knows the game, a 3-player game can take as little as 45 minutes, so it's almost a heavy filler (of course, I've also played a 2-hour 3-player game, so it can go either way, depending on the types of players).

RATING: 7
Let me preface this by saying: buy Aladdin's Dragons first.  That is a superior game of the same vein and if you like it and search for a twist on a heavier blind-bidding game, then get Ys.
Only two things propose Ys as a viable alternative to Aladdin's Dragons.  Placing one mark up and one down is an interesting decision in itself and distinguishes the game.  The other is the market that determines gem values at the end.  More gems or increase their value in the market?  This dilemma confronts the players at all times and is truly what sets it apart.

However, I wish that the city's four regions carried more distinction.  Essentially equivalent, their uniformity zaps the game of some of its attraction.  In addition, theme usually carries little importance to me, but this one is notably poor.

Annoying game.  Too much blind bidding/guessing and not enough control for me.  It also takes a long time to play with anyone that is putting some thought into their moves instead of playing willy-nilly.  At first blush, it seems like the blind bidding decisions you are making each round/turn are important, but in reality, there is so much chaos that your decisions hardly matter.  You end up losing things that you never thought possible, and you win things that you never expected.  Yuck!

Like Noah, I collect games by ""best of breed". Discovered this gem (pun intended, haha) yesterday night. This goes to the top of my Auction/Bidding game list, displacing games like Modern Art et al, which are showing their age. Besides the very clever half open/half hidden bidding mechanics for almost everything, it also has a lot more going on, and all of those mesh beautifully for a game with strategic depth, yet plays well within an hour. The minor complaints of tacked-on-theme, moldy bits, and hence my nickname of "Yeast" for that unpronounceable title, do not detract from my lofty rating.

Juego de mayorías. Consiste en colocar trabajadores en las 12 posibles zonas de una ciudad (dividida en cuatro cuadrantes) para conseguir gemas (las hay de seis colores) o cartas o en la zona de mercado para controlar el precio de las gemas. Es decir, no basta con ser el que más gemas tengas, sino que además conviene que sea la gema más valiosa.

A dos jugadores desluce un poco. Creo que adquirirá esplendor con más jugadores. Por lo demás, es bastante sencillo y se explica en poco tiempo.

I really love the multiple ways of scoring in this game, particularly the gem market which allows players to influence the scale of their potential VPs.

The downside to this game is that there is not a lot of control as it is semi-blind area influence.

A good game that pales in comparison to Aladdin's Dragons and EdelStein&Reich(Basari) as it seems like a combination of those two games without the charm or good looks of either.  I have doubts about it's replayability so I'm glad my friend bought it instead of me.

Not really innovative, the semi blind bidding apart, but everything meshes together well and it plays quickly too.  I would describe it as 'Kniziaesque', which I mean as a compliment, in that it's a livlier and deeper game than you may think from reading the straightforward rules.  The semi-blind bidding works well to enable bluffing that can be effective but is far from overwhelming and the there's a nice tension between collecting jewels/VPs in the city and manipulating values in the market.

UPDATE: Seems like there is a problem with the black gems. Not a huge shock; Ys is so complicated, scoring-wise, the odds of everything being reasonably balanced were not great, and most of Ystari's later games have had significant to quite serious balance problems. The problem with the black gems seems less severe, but still significant: they pay out a lot of points, but they are on a ramping scale, with the more you have the more they're worth. Getting a bunch of them is a guaranteed win. The problem kicks in because the more that one player accumulates, the less they become worth to everyone else. So as a player gets closer and closer to breaking away, there is less and less incentive to actually block him or her short of "taking one for the team". This is a problem, although I don't want to overstate it ... it's an awkward dynamic, not a game-breaking one, but it contributes to the overall roughness of the game.

Interesting, but not so interesting that it justifies the price: http://homepage.mac.com/c_farrell/iblog/C2097221587/E1917380860/index.html

UPDATE: With the price having come down now to more rational levels (you can get it for about $35), Ys is easier to recommend. It's still a bit overpriced, but it is also an interesting game. It's definitely not as "tight" as Aladdin's Dragons, and as a design it doesn't seem to be quite sure what it wants to do. But as a more analytical, tactical take on Aladdin's Dragons, there is some interest there.

RATING: 5
Further below you'll find my original post. To date I've playing Ys once and I'm afraid I wasn't too enthralled. Yet this is a clever design and I can't have this game just have a 3 when it's the same mark I've given to infamous Monopoly (I must have been feeling very generous that day when giving such a good mark to that one!).

Bottom line: For me, Ys is right now a 5. Might go up a bit upon repeated play. But not that much. Particularly the theme doesn't convince both in terms of some of the mechanics and artwork.

----

Perhaps a harsh rating, but the BGG description: "Likely won't play this again although could be convinced." nails it for me. Wouldn't call it bad though. Just not what I enjoy. The various elements don't really convince me if considered in their totality. A pity. I really am fond of majorities games and the market mechanism seemed quite promising.

But then: To each his own. Other people in my gaming group like it. Thankfully, we're in agreement that El Grande is WAY better - just to name one other area control game.

RATING: 8.1
I love playing this game, but I have no idea why from a gamers standpoint.  I like the idea of influence coupled with a bluffing/blind auction, and the mechanics of using influence points for choosing turn order and tiebreaking is really quite clever.  There is really not too much deduction that can be done, which is too bad.  The scoring seems rather arbitrary.  I understand the scoring of the black gems that most people have a problem with.  But the game is decided by 5-10 points usually, which means the loss of 1-2 ties or you tied somebody in the final scoring, where both of you get shafted.  I think because the scoring is arbitrary, I may go back to playing with gems hidden.  If the scoring is going to be arbitrary, then maybe the gathering of gems should be also.  The gathering of gems to keep ahead of your opponents is a Euro trademark that doesn't fit here.  The game works much more on a level of enjoyment than as a heavy game.  If I am going to get shafted on final scoring, it will be due to poor intuition, than just I happen to have the same number of blue gems than one of my opponents or something.  The game is just really fun though.  I love bluffing games, because they elevate the table into a whole new level of enjoyment.  Like Liar's Dice...a look or a wink to your opponent makes the game stimulating.

Improves on Aladdins Dragons by placing the power cards face up for bid so what you get isn't a complete crapshoot, and having only half of the bids hidden which I think reduces the chaos and allows for even more subtle bluff. It is abstract, but the rules are simple and the game is intuitive and deep.

After several plays, I think the game gets a little chaotic and long with 4 and is best with 3 using 3 neighborhoods. A 9 for 3 players, and 7 for 4.

One play makes it hard to judge this game. There's very little theme, but I am very intrigued by the half-blind bidding. That's very unique.

It's not that the game is very difficult, but there is a slight barrier to entry for a medium-weight game. It's hard to know how to bid at first. The cards have cryptic symbols and are not intuitive to play. And the game itself offers very little help or aids to guide the gameplay.

But... with a couple more plays, I can see where the bidding would get very tense, and a poker-like atmosphere could take over. We'll see if I get this to the table often enough to find out if more plays reveal the game's potential strengths or not.

Update: Apparently, the first play with my wife and good friends left a pretty subpar impression. I'm not sure anyone is really excited to try this one again. I eventually traded it away for Agricola.

THE GAME !! 
Despite I havre tried all recent trading game, I'm very convinced by this new game.At first the background of the game is good.
I really enjoy the principe of biding ( revealed and unrevealed ) and you can bid in ine same turn on black pearl, special power, points all things which can bring you pearls of color for which one you can try to influence the price on the market. 
It's really rare that in a game you can win more pearls with a bid of 2 zeros unrevealed than with a bid of 4 revealed.
The nimber of points to distribute between players is nearly the same from game to game and also between players of equal value the difference is light.
As the distribution of points is not taking count of the number of pearls ( at less 1 ) you can choose after what you run to come back on the third player on yellow pearls and not to with the first on blue pearls.
Often, at the main sorrow of the other players, when someone explain to me a new game I'm already disappointed by finding a near game style.
Here, I don't find an equivalent game. Thanks !

RATING: 8
This is a fun semi-blind bidding game.  Each placement of a broker effectively works to bid on two separate things at the same time.   This layering makes the game deeper than it first appears.  It has been prone to analysis a bit too much during the first couple plays, but I'm not sure if that's just unfamiliarity with the game or not.  But I think 45 minutes might be a bit ambitious - the 70 or 80 minute mark is probably more accurate.  Fun, though, and lots of tension.

I was disappointed when I actually got to play this after hearing all the buzz about it.  The gameplay itself is fun and quite involving, but no matter what strategy you use you seem to end up on very similar point scores.  The game also seems quite fiddly and awkward, with exceptions to most rules, but I think my main disappointment is that it is just too overbalanced.

RATING: 3
Y's...well, it's a blind piece placement game, and as those games go, it's not something that I would immediately boycott the playing of...which is something. That said, this game reminded me of a poorly themed, but less chaotic version of Breese's Aladdin's Dragons with a built in stock manipulation aspect to make the gems that you're acquiring slightly more interesting. Like AD, turns consist of placing guys onto the board, in this case, half of them face up, half face down (less chaos...huzzah) and then flipping them all over to get stuff. The problem is that the stuff you're getting isn't overly exciting...gems are the main thing you're chasing, which are cashed in for VPs at the end of the game based on how good they fared in the market (something else you can use your guys for). The other spots are just straight up VPs and special cards (some good, some useless).

I think any game that is over 30 minutes with blind anything as a central mechanism is facing an uphill battle with me, and I do have to mention that, but the bottom line is that Y's failed to really interest me in any way while I was playing it. Sure, there were some little fights over spots here and there, but you can get that in a lot of games, and the gem majority fight never really felt that thrilling either. The entire game probably sounded decent on paper, but on the table it comes across as "Generic Euro Game with Blind Piece Placement".

Wow!! This game is a gem (no pun intended). The blind bidding and market setting opportunities make for a deep game. It can be taught in five minutes and yet offers a lot of variety.

I really enjoyed this bidding game. The bidding decisions were difficult and numerous. However because some of the bidding is blind its not the most difficult bidding game on the market. Ys does have some other excellent things going for it. I really enjoyed the game layout and various VP gaining mechanisms. These made for many of the difficult bidding decisions. I was driving home and thinking about how different a four player game might be. I also came up with at least two more excellent game strategies I want to test out. These are all signs of a great game. The best games often see me driving through red lights and missing my turn.

An underrated (and quick) bidding/stock with multiple was to score.  Neat!  Let's play again!  The game features partially blind bidding - you place two markers, one with the number up one down ... so game length will vary depending on if the players are prone to careful analysis or play intuitively.  Either way I usually have fun with this game.

No bonus points for nice graphics. I like the gem valuation mechanic. Kinda like the region ranking in Princes of the Renaissance without all the combat. I also like the balance between acquiring more gems and changing the worth of the gems. Feels like a cross between Aladdin's Dragons and Keythedral. You sure Richard Breese didn't design it? Although without much theme, the game feels a bit more lifeless than a RB design.

RATING: 6
This game carries a bit of personal history with it which is somewhat embarassing to record. I distinctly remember the first time we chanced upon this game: it was our first Spiel (in 2004) and my girlfriend was immediately drawn to the small stand of the then almost unknown label Ystari. Say what you will, Ys looks very pretty. She talked a bit with Cyril, who explained it, but owing to a lack of other interested people we couldn't play the game. As it was a tad expensive we decided to hold off the purchase, but she always regretted that decision. So she insisted that one year later (when everyone was drooling over Caylus) we pick up a copy. And who am I to say 'no' to her? When we began playing the game, it was with the 2P-variant exclusively. I didn't like the game at this number. The rules require that you play with a neutral 3rd player controlled by both opponents, and this complicates the blind bidding to an unpleasant degree. Add the rather mathy gem prices at the end of the game, and I was secretly plotting to sell off Ys at the end of our second game. But no, that would be a killing offense, so the box remained in our closet, unplayed, unloved, unattended, from 2005 onwards.

Until 2009, almost 4 years later (!). With the aid of a fellow boardgame fan I had been playing all games in my closet which did not get any attention for one reason or another, and so I dug out Ys once more. This would be the clinger: if the game failed now it would end up on the trade pile for sure. To my utter amazement, the game played rather well with 3: the difficult double guessing was made much simpler; the gem market was easier to keep track of (just look at majorities and don't try to calculate your way out of 'em, but follow someone else instead); and a few other things. I had been sitting on a title which was actually somewhat fun to play for so long, and I hadn't even known it. Duh! Needless to say, the status 'to be sold off' was changed to 'kept in the collection', and as a result I've been playing it some more too.

So do I think it is a great game? Well, yes and no. It works well and takes skill to play correctly—as such it is an oft-forgotten Ystari title simply because for many Caylus was the first game which put Ystari on the map. It appears well-balanced and with correct play you can easily  ignore one gem colour altogether. But at the same time it is a rather thought-heavy title which doesn't sit quite  comfortably with the half blind-bidding mechanism. Power cards can be quite annoying to the point where you really must fight the other players for them lest they are used against you. Some cards are outrageously powerful: the card which forces everyone else to place their influence open is a gamebreaker in my opinion. To summarise, they influence your destiny more than I deem proper for the half blind bidding mechanism. If I compare to Aladdin's Dragons, then the latter is much easier to play as it is simpler to see what you obtain, and what it is worth. Speculation is simple and straightforward, which keeps the game purring along at a nice pace. The tie braker is very simple, whereas in Ys there can be a cascade of options which are unpleasant to remember.

For a first-time design Ys is a good game, and somehow I still pride myself that I'd discovered Ystari before they scored their hit with Caylus, but it's not a game I'd put out on every occasion. There are definitely a few rough spots which could stand some coarse sanding and subsequent polishing. This is reflected in the opinion of my opponents: some like it, some don't, citing exactly the 'fiddliness' of the mechanisms causing too much pondering where it should be a quick and smart decision. Nevertheless, the original rate has been altered to bring it in line with how I look upon the game nowadays. But whatever you do, don't play Ys with 2.

Reading/deducing/swaying-by-action the intentions of the other players with relatively little information to go on is an absolutely integral part of this game, both in piece placement and in decisions about scoring. If you don't like that, you'll [b]hate[/b] Ys. It also means that some people might enjoy playing more (or less) with players they know well.

I haven't played enough to be certain about the game's longer-term prospects. While players have certainly won due to having a better feel for the gameflow, or by better reading of other players' intentions, I'm not yet sure how much actual strategy / tactics has influenced our game outcomes.

In some ways, I like that much of scoring is relative rather than absolute - it forces a tradeoff-decision of "do I leave my margin of lead narrow to be efficient but risk being overtaken, or spend effort on making it safer". But in other ways, it feels like a bandaid.

I'm not a big fan of area majority games, but this one is better than many. The partial blind bidding aspect of the placements, as well as the economic interactions with the gem market make it fairly enjoyable.

Still, it's a lot of calculating and recalculating over and over again the majorities (or probabilities of majority) in all the game's regions. That part of the game is just not very exciting... kinda tedious.

The market aspect of manipulating the values of the gems is nice, though... and probably enough to inspire several more plays.

I really enjoy the semi-blind aspect of this game and of course, as with many great games there are many more things that you want to do than you can do.

Players send their henchmen out into the city to exert influence and collect different coloured gems, victory points, and action cards.  It's half blind bidding, in Keydom fashion, but you're in a bit more control here.  Sets of gems pay off different scales of points at the end, based on a market value chart you can tweak during the game.  It all works okay, but the game lacks a spark.  Place, resolve, place, resolve, etc.   Still, it caps at about 90 minutes for four players, and it feels about right.

I got this game from my BGG Secret Santa, and am quite pleased with it. (Thanks Santa!) There's an initial learning curve that slows things down (i.e. "What does that card do, exactly?") but once you're familiar with the game it moves right along. I enjoy the bluffing aspect of the game. Now I need the expansion so that I can play with more than four people...

Enjoyable - There is a lot of room for good play but there is a lot of doing the same old thing from game to game. That lack of 'freshness' will keep it from being a great game. Very disposable, after 1 play you will want to play again right away, after 5 you wont. unlikely to make 15 plays.

There seems to be a number of different strategies to pursue but you have to keep a careful eye on what other people are doing.  The hidden information keeps things tense, in it's relatively short time frame (only 4 rounds long).  I feel that the cards aren't balanced but in the end it doesn't matter since everyone has an equal chance at getting a specific one.  There is also tough decisions on the balance of using your limited values towards turn order/tie breakers vs. influencing market value of commodities/areas that provide choice of gems, cards and victory points.

A gamer's Aladdin's Dragons. Very nice. Lots of interesting decisions to make: player turn position, where to put the brokers etc. The game is tense and the final winner is usually not clear until the end of the game, despite the open scoring. One minor gripe: There's probably a little bit too much open information, which encourages analysis paralysis. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
An underrated game with a great mechanics. A bit abstract, but the combinations of the mechanics in the game are just awesome!

Practically, there is no 'useless' action that you take in the game. Everything that you do, you spend, or you sacrifice to the brokers really affects the whole game from the beginning until the end. I just really-really love the chain of mechanics that made up the game as a whole..

The game will give you a very challenging and competitive feel, and can be categorized as a brain-burner game. Quite easy to learn by gamers. Takes a fairly short time to play, and is best to be played with exactly 4 players.

If you love area-majority, bidding, or bluffing games, I highly recommend you to try (and buy) this game..

After figuring out what was actually happening, this turns out to be a nice bluffing game, the bluff coming when you place some bids face down. If you play smart, you can catch up in one round. The board is a bit busy, and the zones don't really relate to the actions, but gamers will enjoy this exercise a lot.

Played 3 times. Ys is one very sound piece of game design! Having said that, it is so clean, and intelligent, and well balanced, that for me it sort of lack any real flavor. The first playing didn't go so well, but that was do mostly to a rule that is missing from the rulebook. (NB!!! Apparently when playing with 3 players, only THREE of the neighborhoods should be used. This makes a HUGE difference and makes the game much better with 3 players! This is an OFFICIAL rule that was left out of the rulebook by accident.) Played a second time, this time 3 players using 3 neighborhoods, and I enjoyed it a lot more. Played again with 4 players and everyone enjoyed it quite a bit. The deicisions are interesting and the layers of the game are cleverly interwoven (the closest thing to compare it to is Die Macher). Definitely targeted at gamers -- very intelligent game.

Our family enjoys playing this game.  I purchased the 2nd edition and was really disappointed with the replacement of the gems by wooden cubes.  I went out to a local hobby supplies shop and purchased a nice set of glass gems and we play with those.  Everyone agrees that when they really look like gems it make the game more fun.

We're still undecided if the character cards add enough to the game to compensate for looking up rules constantly.  I'm thinking we may just change the winner of the character card always just get a white gem instead.

RATING: 5
As a series of semi-blind "auctions" Ys is a tad long. While there are certainly hints as to what goals other players might be pursuing there is still an awful lot of simple guessing and double-guessing. At some points, like the unnecessarily complicated (and frequently required) tie-breaker rules or the suboptimal iconography, the inexperience of the development team at the time shines through. The characters cards that bend and break the rules in various ways are often situational but sometimes exceptionally strong. Everything works but the game feels a little clunky overall.

Ys is somewhat light on the bluffing aspect (with half the bids being blind and you are trying to convince your opponents that your bids may be higher). That being said, it is still a very well constructed Commodity Speculation game that is quite easy to learn and there is enough to think about that by the final rounds you are really feeling your turns. It took a round before the game really made sense, but by the end of the second round everything was going smoothly. The rulebook is poorly translated, but that doesn't get much in the way of playing this game correctly. While I wasn't totally blown away by Ys, this definitely doesn't feel like anything else I have and I think I would pull it out when I want a meatier game to play with people who don't like to get bogged down in a bunch of rules or convoluted systems. A keeper!

While there are a number of things going on in this blind bidding game, I was lukewarm on it, mostly I think because the individual mechanisms are simplistic, and a little overwhelmed by the "blind" part of the blind bidding system.  The tie-breaker and turn-order mechanisms are nicely interwoven, and there are enough ways to score in Ys to keep it fresh.  Just didn't hit my sweet spot.

In fact it's just another optimization game but thanks to the hidden bidding element it gives a chance to win also to someone without strong analytical skills. The theme is thin but I like the game nevertheless. It's quick, simple and tense which I value a lot.

First off, ya just can't help but want to compare this game to Aladdin's Dragons.  Both are fine games.  Ys definitely has more to consider in terms of how to get gems and increase their value, and I do like playing one broker down and the other broker face up.  The components are  much nicer in Aladdin's Dragons, but the components in Ys are fine.  Themewise, Aladdin's Dragons is more fun, and the game mechanics match the theme.  I like how the areas depend on each other in Aladdin's Dragons, whereas in Ys it's more a matter of adapting and maximizing your points.

5 plays rating of 8.5

Suspected maximum playability before rating would suffer: once per week / 50 annually

The rules are not exactly bad or poorly written, however, they certainly could be better.

I think that this is one of those cases that the goal of "language independent" makes the game suffer in the barrier to entry category.

This could be improved upon if they had included a good set of player reference charts.

This game felt fresh to me. Nothing earth shattering in terms of originality.....its all been done before, just a really nice blend.

This one seems complex when explaining, but upon playing everything falls into place pretty well. There's enough going on that every turn produces the typical angst of too much to do, not enough actions. There's number crunching, but also a good amount of bluff.

Some nice ideas and a lot of stuff going on, but ultimately unengaging. It makes you think very hard, but there is so much chaos that it is not really worth it. Strategic planning is thwarted by too much hidden info. Besides, only by the last of the four rounds you have an idea of the final value of the various gems, and even then it depends on how much you accumulate in relation to other players.

I really like area control, but here most of it takes the form of partial blind bidding and is simply excessive. You have it in the districts of the city to get gems, in each area of the districts for bonuses (so far, so good), in rows of the market to get more gems, in columns of the same market to influence the value of the gems, and then majorities in the gems you own for scoring, not to mention bidding for turn order. There are many, many things to consider when deciding on how to use your pawns, but, in the end, the game feels very random.

Not so much a bad game, just one that I don't particularly like. It's the type of game where I  realize after each move that I've just done a stupid move and it would have been better to do something else. With some games, because they are fun to play despite losing, I might be motivated to try harder next time. But this one seemed too bland, and the theme really didn't come across in the play, so I'm not really itching to try it again to see if I'd like it any more, or get any better at it.

Nice and tense blind bidding (abstract) game. It works very well, but it's also pretty chaotic as you never know how everything will play out, specially not when there's no 2nd place in most cases. The good thing is that there does happen alot in this game. You need to have an eye at a good amount of different majoritys.

I don't mind blind bidding much when it's done right. This game however... having no 2nd place is really scary. You either get 3 points or not, same is true for cards, the market and black gems. All of this is more important then getting gems, where a 2nd and even 3rd place exist for.

[Initial Impression: 9] 
This is a neat auction game that combines blind bidding with fixed value bidding. Players place half of their bidding markers face up, half face down - this leads to some interesting bluffing and escalation behaviors. It is very important to know when to devote more resources to winning an area and when to retreat and use your limited influence to pick up some overlooked areas on the cheap. I especially like the gem market mechanism, as players who use this aggressively can really change the value of the various gems, but generally at the expense of gaining as many gems. The game just screams "relative valuation", as it is all about using your limited resources to gain multiple potential prizes. There is also a heavy dose of psychology and predicting the likely actions of your opponents. Great fun!

Played once.  It was pretty much as expected, and confirmed my suspicion that it is not bad, but was probably released a decade too late.  The concealed placement created tension but made the game feel very chaotic, and the "pricing market" felt a little stale since only the relative positions count - not the absolute values.

I try to play games more than once before deciding whether to keep them, but I feel as though this experience was nothing new, and I've got too many games for this to have a place in my collection.  I feel as though Medici scratches a similar itch but executes it a little more cleanly and invokes a little nostalgia too.

RATING: 7
An attractive semi-blind bidding game in which players bid for prizes while attempting to manipulate their values favourably. Can be thought of as a more serious Aladdin's Dragons or a lighter Amun-Re, but like all blind bidding games the amount you can do to influence your success is strictly limited.

RATING: 7
This is kind of a neat little game.  Semi-blind bidding is a very original idea and I always like a lot of moving pieces in a game.  Ys has a LOT of them.  It tempts you to think that you can figure out what you need to bid or what a gem will be worth, but you really can't.  There is too much hidden/contingent information.  Something about that didn't exactly catch me, but I do admire the idea and think it probably deserves more love than it gets. (1.5 plays)

Una sorta di Wall Street ambientata nel rinascimento, dove si cerca di accumulare le matterie prime che si ritiene varranno di più a fine partita. Basato su un po' troppi elementi aleatori incontrollabili.

This game is technically fine.  But, I really have to knock the theme.  The world does not need another auction game involving gems in a medieval city.  It is just not compelling, particularly when the theme does not really have much to do with the game mechanic.  There was a time I would have given this game a higher rating, but that time has passed.

RATING: 6.5
Once I liked it more. 
Half-blind worker placement, bluffing, territory control, collecting, stock market manipulation - it’s all there.  But the game is very dry.  And it felt repetitive after several plays.  There is limited no. of paths to pursue and each of them is pretty straightforward.  There are no subtle or sophisticated connections between these paths so mixing them won't breath a fresh air into the game.  Some elaborate moves may occur only on purely tactical level (being connected with half-blind placement of workers).

Character cards' execution is utterly pathetic (only symbols on them, no graphics or even a name...).

Sold.

RATING: 8
You either like blind bidding or you don't, stay away if you don't although some will still take to this anyway as its quite compelling...

This is a new favourite, what a great first game for this company. Very balanced game, a ton to think about, multiple paths to victory, lots of intrigue via semi-blind bids, great turn angst as decisions are tough, FUN, great mechanics like bidding pieces are used for ties but are not playable on board(quite important), market manipulation, power cards, area control, great bits if you have the jewels (1st version)...I will be buying some stones to replace the new "wood" jewels which are crappy as playing with something that looks like jewels adds a little to the theme. Excellent game, best with 4 and also plays great with 3. I would like to try 5 as it would be a great tight game although I don't see myself purchasing the expansion just for that.

[u]UPDATE:[/u] 8.5 => 8 down just slightly, its a tad dry but still an excellent game.

[u]UPDATE:[/u]okay it has been said before but I can't believe how much they 'borrowed' from AD now that I have played it, wow that is 2 of RB's games, not good. There are improvements here though like less chaos and a little more strategy so I'm happy to have this version but this borrowing seems a little uncool...

Played twice, both with 4 players. The 2nd time we played with the King's favor variant... I don't think I like this variant (before scoring the King's favor I was in 2nd place, after was moved to 4th place :).

RATING: 6
Decent game about acquiring gems in a fantasy/medieval city setting.

Based on one play, I think Ys is a neat game. It's a medium/heavyweight German-style game, meaning lots of intricate rules mechanisms and various ways of acquiring victory points.

In particular, I disliked two things about the game. Firstly, the bidding, though only "half-blind", is still too blind for my tastes, and a lot of the broker placement boils down to guessing and double-guessing (or often, just trusting to luck). Not my cup of tea, but at least the half-blind mechanism is a lot better than truly blind bidding.

Secondly, ties and a host of tie-breaking mechanisms are central to the game, and I guess 10-20% of the rules text concerns itself with listing the various tie-breaking rules. Knowing how to manipulate ties becomes a vital skill when playing, and to me that doesn't feel very elegant.

Still, despite those two issues, there is much to like about Ys. It isn't the next Puerto Rico, Princes of Florence, or Amun-Re, but it's a decent game all the same.

RATING: 8
A very playable "blind bid" game (a la "Doge" or "Alladin's Dragons").  The decisions here seem tighter than the latter, and there seem to be more viable strategies than in the former.  A very enjoyable play.  This will hit the table frequently for the next year, especially as it plays in about an hour.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
based on 1 play - nice mix of bluffing and "open" information.  Nice alternate paths to victory.  Some special cards and some of the tiebreaker rules are a little confusing - a good twenty minutes of rules explanation here, but still a little lighter than Caylus.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Played the basic game with four players and I can't wait to play again...

Lots of fun and the strategies are quite varied.  The different ways to manipulate the end game points for gems and influence seem to be quite balanced.  Our first game was determined by less than 12 points.

I feel that this is a game that should almost always be played with four (maybe five with the expansion).

I will definitely be buying a copy when the Rio Grande edition is available.

RATING: 7
Decent enough blind/semi-blind bidding game.  Unfortunately, I own and prefer Aladdin's Dragons.  Ys attempts to put a bit more strategy with the gem values, but the blind bidding strategy almost contradicts it, in my opinion.  Again, not a bad game by any means, but I think Aladdin's Dragons is similar enough AND better.

First Play: Decent semi-blind bidding game where you are trying to collect gems, VP, special cards, and influence the value of gems in the market.

There is a surprising amount of tension created by the half-blind bidding system.  There are so many choices, I tend to try to not overanalyze - one could really get bogged down in thought, which makes the game a lot less fun.  Very abstract, with a pretty bogus theme, but the board is attractive, and when you use the gems, the theme almost becomes believable.  This is a very approachable game - though it may seem initially complicated (mainly due to the market, which can be a little confusing for some), it flows nicely.  I have had success teaching this to my family members, though people in my gaming group seem to really dislike it, for reasons I cannot understand.

Mechanically a brilliant game that puts bidding, area majorities and worker placement together and adds a genius touch of bluff and takes an element from the scoring of Tigris & Euphrates while making it visible for all. The issues lie within the clumsy special cards and the convoluted tie breaking rules. The cards break the flow of the game a bit as they tend to require a bit of rules consulting especially regarding timing and the timing is really the clunkiest thing about them. Instead of the cards you could as well just play the inner district with white gems. Other than these everything works absolutely well together, the game length is perfect and the level of tension is awesome. I would perhaps avoid playing with people who tend to like overly thorough analysis and statistical odds.

The semi blind bidding was okay, the market was okay, the cards were okay.... it was... okay. Not bad, but nothing to write home about either. I didn't like the direct confrontation/pissing matches that occur. You could spend your whole wad fighting and then have nothing to show for it. Not alot of pleasant banter either. As I said - it's okay. Doesn't work with my group dynamic.

  Works extremely well with 4 and  with 3 using only 3 neighborhoods.  2 player version is also acceptable, although I usually disdain the "play as a dummy 3rd player" types.  This one still works, however.  Many different paths to victory and the game feels different each time I have played. 18 or so plays with varying number of players so far.  Awesome!
A minor, minor subtraction for that blind-bidding mechanic (1/2 in this game) that many people seem to dislike.

This is an involved semi-bling bidding game.  The game it most resembles would be Aladdin's Dragons.  I think I like this game better though.

Alladin's Dragons feels like it has a richer theme as well.

Years later and I have just completed my third play of this game.  I enjoyed it more this most recent session than ever before.

Ys is from an older German-game style.  It has a few complications, especially with the cards.  But overall it belongs to the "Euro game with a cool idea" sort of game.  This is a genre I have enjoyed in the past, and rue that modern games have turned away from to instead have multiple layers of mechanisms to figure out.

I;d happily play more of this game.

This is a very interesting half-blind bidding game.  There are lots of ways to accrue victory points, and people will battle it out over the benefits of each district.

Played just once so this is just my first feeling of game: bluff game is a bluff game and this is the biggest reason I'm not a fan of Ys. Another reason is the length of the game: it's too long because its basically the same game from the beginning to the end; I mean there is no drama at all! Ok, we made a one big mistake: we put our gems behind the screens so I'm not sure how much better the game will be when played with right rules BUT still there are those problems what said before. If you like Ys, you'll probably like Aladdin's Dragon and Dschunke too. Those all aren't my cup of tea, because of bluff-element.

A cross between Aladdin's Dragons and Basari, which are both games I have enjoyed, so why didn't I like this one?  I think fundamentally it is because in both games of Ys I played, I was frustrated and annoyed and unable to make much headway, whereas that was the fate of another player when I played AD or Basari.  The blind bidding system (even semi-blind as here) has the potential to be chaotic, with someone's larger investment in one area being completely nullified by someone else's larger investment or, conversely, someone's throwaway broker paying out big time for almost nothing.  Clearly, chasing black gems is strong.  Equally clearly some of the special cards are way way more powerful than others (the 'break all ties' one for example is very powerful since there are potentially a lot of ties, but then there is a card that switches two of the port cards around, which is practically useless).  Overall, I would rather play AD again.

7/2006: Mixed impression after first 3-player game.  It's an ok game and the task of collecting different gems is a fairly balanced challenge.  It would have been a lot more interesting if collected gems were hidden.  The game didn't live up to high the expectations though.  Apart from a nice theme and wonderful graphics there isn't anything new, only mix-and-match of mechanics from other recent games (E&T, DieMacher, ...).  Also, the game doesn't seem finished.  Theres too many errors in the rules and too many exceptions and special rules for different situations. Surely this could have been more streamlined.

7/2006: The glass gems is a good idea but doesn't work.  The black gems are really dark blue, and the yellow and green gems are hard to tell apart.  Unless you have excellent lighting and a crisp white playing surface the glass gems makes the game harder to play.  I'd say stick with the wooden cubes.

RATING: 5
(Rated after 1 game) I found this game pretty dull - perhaps it was the way it was explained (mechanics rather than theme) but it was a game of pushing little blocks of wood and mosaic tiles (admittedly pretty) around a cardboard board - it failed to excite any of us.
I'll give it another try, but first time felt pretty flat.
---
ETA: After reading the other comments on this game, I see why I didn't like it! The comparison to Basari etc nailed it for me - I hate blind bidding games, and this game has (under all the pretty components) essentially a very large blind bidding component. There are better ways to spend my time.

I soooo wanted to like this more. Its BEAUTIFUL! I'm a sucker for bits and colorful sturdy production values, and it has those. I'm not terribly fond of the blind bidding. Perhaps its my lack of math skills, or ability to track what is or is not too much to pay for something. It has potential if you are more fond of that sort of game; in that it seems very balanced with several equally possible tactics to win. I'm willing to try it again to see if this improves. Perhaps I just need some instruction from a Ys master.

After one play (half of which was spent in confusion as we were being taught as we went by a first-time-player), I'd say it's OK and I'd probably play it again -- but I certainly won't mind if I don't. After the game ended, I spent about half an hour thinking about how it could be made BETTER (e.g. if only two of the bids per round had to be blind) and I'd rather be playing games that are good to begin with.

RATING: 8
While Ys doesn't has a complicated rule, and can be played more or less in an hour, I think it is very brain burning. It is because there is so much hidden information from other players. You have to do a lot of guessing and deducing, bluffing and faking. Also no matter where you place your bid, it always be influencing more than one area (it even has a 2D table for placing bids). I think the artwork is terrible (or not for my taste) and the special power cards are annoying (poor presentation, it is difficult to understand the function of the card. From gameplay wise these special abillies are annoying too). I think the game could be smoother without those special cards. Although I like making some of the decisions in Ys (I like deduction exercises), I'd hope there are more similar games that have better design. Unfortunately there is so few games in this genre. P.S. I think the 5 player expansion doesn't work well. ===UPDATE===The gameplay is good and overcome its poor presentation.(*Bluffing, Blind bidding, Area majority)

I was very excited to have finally gotten this game on the table.  It's a semi-blind bid influence / stock manipulation game where players take turn placing merchants (with values 0-4) onto different areas of the city.  Players play 8 pieces in total and each turn 1 is placed face down (value is hidden) and one face up.  After four rounds of placing 2 merchants majority winners gain gems, cards (special powers) and gold (victory points).  Players can also choose to play their pieces onto a small grid to influence the stock-market.  There's a lot too this game and tie-breakers, trickery and a bit of luck play a factor.   The game works well for what it is but I found it to be extremely dry.  I never felt like a merchant, there's no story and little build-up throughout the game.  I left feeling very disappointed although I would probably play it again but would much rather play something like Aladdin's Dragon's which I found to be much more flavourful.

By all normal measures I should hate this game, but for some reason I don't. I am not really a fan of games with a million ways to score points, but it leads to lots of tough decisions during your turn and finger crossing during your opponent's, hoping that they haven't just edged you out in that last gasp bid for the area you desperately want. There's some enjoyable bluff and conflict here, and the game doesn't drag.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
An area influence game wherein players place markers in various parts of a city to earn gems and influence how much those gems are worth at the end of the game.  Half of the influence makers are placed face-down, and the other half are placed face up, so players have just enough information to drive themselves mad trying to figure out what to do.  Players bid for turn order (and tie breakers) using the same makers they place in the city, and tie breakers (at least in my first game) played a huge role.

The game is relatively short for a game of this thoughtfulness, making me want to play it more.

Bought because it was recommended for people who like the unavailable Aladdin's Dragons.  Having played it, the bidding mechanic is similar but much else is different.  Requires the player aid when learning the characters cards as they lack text and it is often unclear when they can be played.

I am having one dickens of a time getting this one to the table.  In two years I have played it twice.  The trick is how to engage the players because the game itself does not tell a story.

Play two bid tokens into the city or market (one token is face up and one is face down). Reveal values of tokens to earn majority values in five types of gems, cards, and changing the market value of gems. Not bad as an area control game, but you may lose many resources fighting battles. Many ways to earn VPs and quite hard to keep track of your opponent's net worth as the gem values are changing. Pretty good game.

I'm not the biggest fan of blind-bidding, but the "half-and-half" nature of the bid info in this game works for me just fine. I love how the various parts are woven togehter - i.e. bidding to win the gems in the marketplace has an effect on the values of all the others. I do wish we'd stop forgetting the rule about whoever has the highest total in the marketplace gets to adjust one gem value up and one value down - we've screwed it up the last two games we've played!

I think gambling games don't snag my attention so well, if that's their main feature.  Although the pieces and board are gorgeous, and the sparkly little gems are very pretty, it isn't as fun as, say, Manila, where there are boat races...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
It's very difficult to control, half of the agents are unkown and there are almost no data to guess from. Even if you knew, your rivals can place later and undo whatever you accomplished. And even if they don't, the value of the gems can change completely from top to bottom in the last second.

Way too much thinking and way too much for the very little control you have. This game would be fun if it was a half an hour filler.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
First impression (4 players): Feels a lot like Morgenland. Ys isn't a pure blindbidding as you must play two pieces at once and one is face down and others value you see. And unlike in Morgenland you don't need to use collected gems during game. They are purely collected for points but value of them can be manipulated. You must like blind bidding and/or outguessing opponents as a mechanic as that is all there is basically.

After 3 plays, still impressed by the mechanisms: you have more information than Morgenland (still a good ratio of bluff) and multiple ways to score.

Don't let the mold issue scare you away.  Its a great game.

There's a lot going on in this auction game, which is as much about hidden information as anything else.

RATING: 7
This game reminded me a lot of Aladdin's Dragons (aka Morgenland): (semi- )secret bidding, spells/characters and getting majorities to collect gems/treasures. However, I would prefer Aladdin's Dragons above this one, as Aladdin's Dragons had a much stronger theme (never felt like a broker when playing Ys) and I like the fact that in Aladdin's Dragons you need the treasures to get artifacts (who give you a special power during the game), while in Ys you need gems just to get an other majority.

Maybe the above sounds like I don't like Ys, which ain't the case as (blind) bidding and getting majorities are 2 game mechanisms I like. So if anybody would ask to play this, I would happily do so :-)

RATING: 4
Ys has too much hidden information for my taste. I often felt I had little to go on--you can never be sure which gems will be worth the most because you can't see the face down brokers in the market. You can't be sure which areas you will win and the best I could make were educated guesses as to what my opponents had placed. It's possible with experience and everyone playing rationally your guesses could be more accurate but the game was not compelling enough for me to want to play it many more times.

That said, I'd like to play at least once more.
Edit: Scratch that, this puppy's up for trade. I have the latest edition (China printing, no dude on the cover, plastic irregular cut gems).

Awfully derivitave--bidding and magic cards from Aladdin's Dragons and Aristrocrat socing (black gems) from St. Petersburg.  Probably other game engines in there I'm not thinking of right now.  Played it 2-player and it was close (98-89-64, the low score being the dummy player the two manage together).  I don't know if I like that version of 2-player for a game.  Overall, it's just a bunch of mechanics that don't flow well.  Rules aren't well written (e.g. why does it matter that white stones go in the first row of the market and why do they keep referring to row 0 when the rows that are left empty are labeled '4' and '5'?  Needs work.

A mathematically interesting but very dry exercise in arranging tokens best in response to opponents' arrangements, to acquire the most 'gems' and make those 'gems' more valuable.  First-time players who haven't memorized what all the cards do, and when they are allowed and not allowed to be used, haven't got a chance.  I'd like to try the game again a few times, as time permits, but it didn't seem to grab my attention the first time.

RATING: 7
Pronounced 'iss. 

All in all I think both once we learn the character cards and various strategies, as well as probably gain another player or two, the game could rate higher for me.

I've played this now with three and four people and it does improve as I had thought with more regular play.  I strongly agree to using the Kings-whatever-option even with new players.  The extra layer in strategy is welcoming and certainly not overwhelming.  I wish there was even another one to three layers that could be put in.

It's very fun but the pasted, bizarre, theme lowers my interests and though it probably shouldn't it also lowers my rating.

This is an interesting blend of blind bidding, open bidding and area control mechanics.  There's a lot going on each turn, which is good, but borders having too much to consider for each action.

First impressions tend to be focused on production quality, and here I was mildly disappointed.  We got the edition of Ys with silkscreened numbers (rather than the stickers I was expecting), however, a number of pieces were either dusty or looked like they were dropped in the dirt.  The pieces cleaned up ok, except for some that looked like they got some of the printing ink on them.  I can't decide whether to contact the publisher for replacement pieces or to be proud of the fact that they have character. UPDATE: I got the replacement pieces, and they look fantastic. the publisher was courteous and shipped promptly

These comments reflect my first play; it was a two player game.

The rules were very logical. At one point we got stuck and wondered how we were to resolve it, made a guess then consulted the rules, and were delighted to see that we were correct.  Certainly games can have whatever logic they want, but we were delighted that we could anticipate what the rules were supposed to be and found no surprises.

We both liked the game a lot; while we were slow, we could see that it was more because we were new to it, and that the game would normally play as quickly as people want.  As many other reviewers have remarked, the idea that we're dealing with imperfect information generated a lot of delightful tension in the game.

The character cards offers a number of tactical advantages that spice up the game. More generally, it's easy to spot what types of strategies are available to you as you play the game.

I'm also delighted to see that in the two player game, we could adjust the difficulty of the neutral player.  I'm not normally a fan of games that require a neutral player to scale down to 2 players, but I can see why its needed here.

For those who love Ys but want to get in a quick game, there are optional rules for that purpose.  I haven't given it a try but again, the fact that I have this option available is delightful and contributes to the perception that this is a very replayable game.

After 1 play, I'm holding off on ranking it until I can try it again. I have a feeling that this would be much more exciting as a 3 or 4 player game and will rate it after I manage to play with 2 or 3 others.

UPDATE: after a few more plays I'm really liking the dynamics of this game. This is a hidden gem, and if you ever have a desire to play something with economic elements in the game, you should try this one out.

Of all the Ystari games, I've found I enjoy this one the most. Yes there's some blind bidding, but it's not totally blind.

RATING: 7
An interesting take on area control using pawns with different levels of strength. Every turn you place two pawns, one face-up and one face-down, in the same or different regions. The face-down pawn hides value to allow the player to bluff how much control he has in that region.

My rating may increase with another play because we played with our collected gems hidden behind our screens. The rules state that they should remain public information which is also how I would prefer to play the game.

Only 1 play.

Was good, but would be getting close to great if it had taken about half the time.  Area majority and blind bidding very well blended.

I think it took us over 2hrs - on the box says 45-90 and this is probably accurate - I think should get through it in about 75 and it would be great gaming experience in that timeframe.  Lots of things to consider which is where the AP can seep in. The scoring options seems very well balanced, really neat mechanics, simple ruleset but a lot of depth to the decisions - there are so many ways and areas that the players can compete against each other that it seems like it is a naturally self-balancing and tight game. In all a really well crafted game.

Marked down due to the time it took to play.  The rating will definitely go up substantially if further games play quicker.

Too dry for any sense out of its "theme". Too opaque to be a good abstract. Double think is there, but there's so many layers of opaqueness overlaying it, you're more immersed in yourself and making combinations in your head than you are caring about what other players do. My biggest problem is the theme - no appeal, no sense and I don't enjoy the art as well. For a game of this ilk, I'll take Revolution! any day over this. 

EDIT - it's got a weird sense of artificiality and gameness about it. I think it's a robot from outer space.

Yet another souped up blind bidding game, crossing Aladdin's Dragons type of bidding on a complicated board, where every bid means at least two things. If you like area control and this type of complicated scoring system, you will like the game. It's at least as good as AD, probably better. But it feels old, nothing more than iterative improvement on previous games with similar mechanics.

Solid first offering from Ystari games. Take stock speculation, area control and blind bidding, toss them together and you get Ys.

The components are of good quality.

The game? It plays fairly quick: players use their turn order markers (0-4) to bid for turn order. They then place these (one face up, one face down) in different quadrants of a city to gain gems/VPs/special cards. They can also choose to play them onto the 'stock market' to influence the value of gems. Players who have the most VPs (value of gems on stock market, etc) win! 

Neat little game but the limited information of the blind bidding will put off 'serious' gamers.

Többségi taktikai, de némi stratégiát is igénylő jól kitalált játék. A játékosok a város negyedeiben, amelyek még három részre vannak osztva próbálnak többséget elérni különböző erősségű jelzőikkel. Lehet teljesen nyíltan, illetve a fázisonkénti két jelző közül az egyiket rejtve lehelyezni. Ékkövekért folyik a harc, amelyek értékét a játék végén lévő piaci áruk határozza meg. A piac is ugyanúgy befolyásolható a játék alatt, ahogyan a város negyedei. Ehhez még hozzájön pár kellemesen erős kártya, illetve szimpla pont, ami a város negyedeinek egyes harmadaiban nyerhető el. Ezért jól meg kell fontolni, hol, milyen erővel próbáljunk többséget elérni. A játék ketten is érdekes egy semleges játékos bevonása miatt. Kíváncsian várom a többjátékos alkalmat.

When I first considered picking this up I feared that it would be another version of Aladdin's Dragons.  While I'm a fan of that game, I didn't need two copies, if you know what I mean.  Well, it looked like it would go out print, so I figured better to buy and sell at a high price than kick myself in the ass for not getting it.  Well, I'm not selling this one.  Yes it has some of the blind influence mechanism that AD has, but it feels like an entirely different game.  There is a fun little stock system and wonderful choices as to multiple paths to victory.  I don't see any one strategy being more powerful than the others as my results were a very tight point spread.  This one is going to get some serious play.

Reminds me of Doge, Aladdin's Dragons, and Basari.  I like the latter two games, but it is a bit fiddly like Doge.  As much as I enjoyed it upon my first session, I wonder if the game is too long for one that involves so much blind guessing.  It's almost as if the game appears on the surface to be deep and involving but at its core it's 1 1/2-2 hours that boils down to who the best guesser is.  Update:  for some reason it fails to engage me.  It looks nice and shiny but doesn't have enough depth for a game of this length.  I don't feel like my decisions matter as much as they appear to on the surface.

Excellent game - similar to but vastly superior to Aladdin's Dragons, it fixes the runaway leader problems that led me to trading that game away.  The blind bidding mechanism works here because it's only partial blind bidding, and the powerful cards work here because to get them you have to give up going directly for VP that turn.  This makes for excellent choices every turn.  Highly recommended; best with three players (not using one quarter of the city).

Feels like a pretty good step-up game towards the more serious stuff. Simple, sturdy majority game, easy ruleset. The half blind/half open bidding works well, the rules to determine order of play and draw-adjudication can make for some nice twists. One drawback: the special cards. Needlessly complicated in some cases, and they seem to detract from the basic concept. Could benefit from a little extra aside from the positioning game and those cards could have been a good way to get that little extra, but IMO they miss the mark.

I was a little afraid the blind portion of the bidding would turn me off from the game, but it is actually just fine here.  Some of the cards which I also feared would be game-breaking if combined, turned out to be not the threat they first appeared.  The area control, and tipping of the overall values of the gems have appropriate counterbalances, and there is a definite lack of ability to do even half of what you want to do in a turn.  Since it is a hodge-podge of mechanics which are very well counterbalanced with each other, this game is definitely not a genre-definer, it is however, a fun game that I would play anytime.

It's an ok game, but it doesn't grab me as much as I would have thought.  For some reason, it is just not all that exciting.  Too much calculation without the extra fun needed to make it worth waiting for people to do the math.

A mix of bidding and bluffing, as half of your bids are placed face down. Toss in some market manipulation, competing for majorities, and special ability cards. While it is fairly easy to play, it's hard to wrap your brain around! The 'character' cards could be clearer; some of the graphics on them are confusing.

The game that started it all! The universe and everything!... but mostly just Ystari as a publisher. The rest is [thing=18602]history[/thing].
So, what do we think about Demaegds first effort? Well, it sure involves a lot of area majority. Majorities are all over the place. Majority for city quadrants, majority for areas in majorities, majorities in adjusting commodity values, majorities for player order, majorities for the queen, majorities for commodity points. Yep, that's a lot of majorities.
It works quite well once you get your head around to which majorities are determined how. It's a perfectly solid design. But it does show that it's an older title. I don't know how it does that, but it just feels like a game from that era. That is not a knock on the game, but game design has evolved since then and sometimes we want a bit more these days.
We also played with the expansion, but we left out the event cards as I tend to dislike those. I can't say which of the expansion cards came out so my score reflects the game with the expansion thrown in.

Initial score: 6.5/10

Middle Weight Blind Bidding game with good strategy and an acceptable amount of disinformation to make this an entertaining game.  Needs more plays.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Currently my rating is based on one play.  It took us about 1.5 hours to play due to working through all the rules, it is a bit more difficult to explain out of the gate, but the mechanics are easy once everyone has stepped through a couple of turns.  Current concerns are it is difficult to decide what to do in the market until after the first turn in which you have actually obtained some gems and know what to manipulate.  However if it happens to be the one that dropped the lowest you find yourself with a 4 slot deficit to make up.  Not insurmountable but difficult, especially if the one in the lead has people with an interest in keeping it that way.  Still fun, and worth more play.

Rarely able to get this to the table.  Downgraded from 7 to 6 on 4/15/10

Interesting area control game. You know not the exactly streng of the oponnents pawns, becaue ecery player puts on the board one pawn face up and one face down.

You have different areas to get majority. Every place is part of something bigger - one district is part of a quarter. So when you put your pawn in the town you could get a card, a black jewel or points and at the same time you`re could get jewels. When you put your pawn on a market you try to get a jewel and have influence of the proce of the jewels. Something similar like in the game Bruxelles.

Might wanna give Ys express a go with slower players.

Still definitely worth playing again. (-08)

Another Works bargain, but I'm not inclined to spread mould around the place, so this one will remain firmly in the plastic wrap until Ystari see fit to replace the spore-encrusted pieces that shipped with the game.

Edit: Looking forward to trying this now fresh new pieces have arrived - thanks Ystari!

Edit: A nice little game, but not as much fun as many of our other Works purchases. If the playtime was closer to the one hour mark, I could see it being a nice little filler game. As it is, I can't see it getting many more plays.

Don't play this 5 player.

This game is frequently mischaracterized as a blind-bidding game; it's NOT a blind-bidding game!

Blind bidding implies that you have no knowledge of what others are going to do when you make your move; the key feature of blind-bidding games is that all players make their choices at the same time and reveal simultaneously.  The vast majority of this game is done sequentially, not simultaneously.  There are *four* blind bids the whole game, and those are the bids to see who goes first/last.

The game should actually be classified as a partially-hidden area majority game.  You will see what others do and be able to strategically make your move based on what those others do, your goal being to have the most influence in as many areas as possible.  This game is closer to El Grande than to a blind-bidding game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
It's a very abstract game, but everybody really enjoyed the game thoroughly. Many things to track. Player position each turn is extremely important. I really like how some of the pieces are played upside down and others right side-up which makes decision making a lot more difficult. An imperfect information area-majority game for battling for special powers and gems, this packs a good punch in about 1 to 1.5 hours. Probably plays great for 3 or 4 players.

Great game! Nice art. Cover and box give you something to feel, which contributes to the atmosphere. The auction&bidding system was new to me, placing your bets partly open and partly hidden. What I also like very much in a game is, when I'm loosing but can't tell "10" (exaggeration) rounds in advance. I really thought I had a chance of winning this one but wound up last in the final round.

Very interesting bidding/VP game.  Played a two player pilot, and actually had more fun following the two player rules than I thought I would.  Also did a 4 player game with the group.  A few of the players thought the game offered too much opportunity for minute analysis (leading either to paralysis, or oh-what-the-heck decisions.)  I think this game will take a few more plays to really wrap our heads around the valuation and scoring.

RATING: 10
This game is superb. Takes what was started with Aladdin's Dragons (Morganland) and does it that much better! What a great game and I don't even have Ys+. Not sure I want it as 4 players on this board is crowded enough. The game runs GREAT with 3 players and I like the 2 player variant. It's a dummy player but works! In the rules under the 2 player variant it says to use a neutral player with a value of 0, 1, 2 and 4. It goes on to say that you can increase this with skill level of the players. I've found a very effective set of numbers is 1, 2, 2, 4. Each player gets to play this set of brokers for the neutral player. This can be loads of fun. 

UPDATED: Man every time I play this game I love it. I enjoy this gaming experience each and every single time. Why is it not a 10 yet? I don't know I just seem to have a hard time feeling it a 10 but I never not want to play and would never say "no" to it...a little more time perhaps. 

UPDATED AGAIN: In keeping with the rating system's descriptions I moved this to a 10. I will always want to play, I will suggest and will never turn down a game of this. 

To play this 2 players requires the players to use a dummy color and it's one of the few variants like this that I'm ok with. YOu see both are using the same color and alternate playing for that color so they have to be careful to bid heavily with the alternate color as their opponent may then use the alternate color to out bid them too. It's actually quite fun.

(Plus a walkthrough of three rounds)

Something here just doesn't click for me.

I think it's combined open and blind bidding for a lot of things at once, and for too many rounds before the pay-off - it's too much auction all rolled up together.

It's a difficult one to rate, I can see that there ought to be a good game here, and the production values are nice, but it simply doesn't work for me.

This game is a real puzzle for me.  I like it, but I get done playing it and feel unsatisfied.  I love the graphic design and the color, the mechanics are pretty neat, but the experience just fails to grab me.   It doesn't have enough flavor for a theme-whore like me.  It falls prey to some of the worst traits of cookie-cutter Euros, in that it's very, very dry, the theme is unimaginitive, and it's somewhat baffling for new players.  It seems deep, and it seems well balanced, but when it comes down to it, I'm not sure there's much fun in that box.

The market is not particularly fluid. It seems best to avoid spending resources on market influence until the end, and instead spend those resources to obtain the goods that others are raising the value of.

Clever game of "partial blind bidding" for actions/resources. An interesting blend of elements, a few that seem reminiscent of Aladdin's Dragons or Basari... The rules were far more crisp and clear than I expected from the 90 minute gameplay estimate -- we wrapped up our first game, with rules explanation, in 30 minutes flat. I don't see how this could possibly take 45 minutes or more, even with the maximum number of players. Fits in a relatively scarce niche -- too long to be a filler, too light and too short to be the main course... Perhaps the salad in between the appetizer and the steak?

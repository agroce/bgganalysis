You can find my final thoughts in my video review of this game (spanish language).
But in summary, I love the production (Excellent components quality).
The basic rules are not overly complicated and you can add complexity with other rules if you want. The single player game works great (fog of war works). Good mechanical. Set up not very intuitive at the begining,but after a few games no problems about that. 
Add numbers in the hexes would be a good idea, at least in my opinion, to play the full gampaign witohut problems, in case you don't have a table to put the game on for several days. 
Overall 8.5 points for me.

Well, I'm glad I played it.

BitE is an attempt to best Craig Besinque's EastFront. Seems like the idea was, "if we throw more stuff in the tube, it'll be better!"

That's not the way it works in the real world.

With a game of this size (and by virtue of the size, complexity), more usually makes the game less enjoyable. The inclusion of air blocks makes stacking more treacherous. Separating artillery from the units gives players the wrong sense of scale (although the mechanism to represent it is pretty nifty). And separating production into air and land ups the number of things to keep track of without increasing the enjoyment dramatically.

We played the introductory, basic scenario. if the advanced rules are modular, the game may be salvageable. But at the current price point, is it too pricey for what you get. True, you get a lot, but you won't get to play many complete games. There are just not enough hours in the day.

The game has many options and generally allows for a great deal of strategy in your gameplay, both sides play differently and so there’s a lot of replay value here, but the sheer size of the game makes it neccessary that the design approach is about helping the player to actually to be able to use the offered options and so anything that slows down the game or gets in the way should be avoided.

In my opinion, the combination of a very detailed map (which would work fine in a traditional hex ‘n counter game) with so many blocks and so many steps of movement and combat is not working. That’s my major point of criticism, and for me it’s really a show stopper. I can live with some design aspects I don’t get given the time and scale of the game, I think the rules and the charts are now fully working and there should be no problem of getting into the game, I absolutely think that the game offers some really nice ideas and the support by the designer is outstanding. Personally I don’t like the use of the gazillion dice, that’s again something that slows down the game in a way it should not, the dice fest combat gets more in the way than it helps, but that is open to debate based on personal preferences or ‘taste’. We didn’t like it in A&A and we don’t like it in BITE, but others may disagree.

Besides the good and the bad we mentioned in the main review and the aspects I stressed here in my personal verdict, I now have to answer the question: is this a good game you should get and will I play it again?

Yes, I think there’s a good game in the BITE box and you should get it if the Eastern Front topic is something you are interested in.. and if you are a very patient gamer without too fat fingers so you can handle the ‘Blocks in the Way’ issues the game has. Don’t get it if you are looking for the typical block game with FoW and elegant and quick game mechanics. BITE is an interesting game despite the blocks, not because of them…

Initial Impressions: I'm not experienced enough with block wargames, but this game really had the "bucket of dice" feel to it. The rules felt only half-cooked and will definitely need a few revisions and errata before I attempt to play the game again. The components are beautiful though, and the designer is always available to answer questions.

One year later: I've gained quite a bit of experience with block wargames. I no longer have any intention of giving this game series another chance as it's not worth my time or energy when there are so many better games to consider. I've also had a number of negative experiences with the designer and his fanboys. Their systematic attacks on commentors and reviewers who post something negative include threats and accusations. If the designer wants to be considered a professional then he needs to start behaving like one.

RATING: 9.9
Limited edition, deluxe map. Playing with the basic rules.

Less is more - short rules, but a deep game. Buckets of dice that are giving it a high emotional impact while the intricate decisions about where and how to reinforce, move and attack are tactically and strategically demanding and rewarding.

In three words: Fun, fun, fun! 

This is an east front game that even non-grognards will love! It is the best block game (perhaps even the best wargame) that I own (and I own a bazillion of'em)!

Il gioco è veramente completo e in certi versi molto complesso sopratutto quando si gioca alla massima difficoltà… un vero gioco per esperti.
Per apprezzare il gioco bisogna imparare tutte le dinamiche che lo compongono,  conoscere le strategie e superare lo scoglio del piazzamento iniziale.
Il gioco rispecchia la realtà degli eventi realmente accaduti quindi, la Germania ha poche possibilità di vincere ... ma è proprio questa la sfida che ogni giocatore deve affrontare ... vincere con la Germania!
Dopo diverse decine di partite, posso effettivamente confermare che la Russia inizialmente è molto svantaggiata (come nella realtà del resto), infatti, nelle prime fasi del gioco (fino a dicembre 1941) deve resistere all'assalto distruttivo dell'armata tedesca ... ritirandosi velocemente cercando semplicemente di rallentare il tedesco.
Assurdi attacchi contro il tedesco nei primi mesi di guerra sono inutili e dispendiosi… create fanterie a 1 e riempite tutti i buchi del fronte … senza lasciare spazio ai panzer tedeschi.
Cercate di salvare il salvabile, non vi fossilizzate ai continui accerchiamenti che un tedesco esperto vi può causare … le perdite verranno facilmente rimpiazzate dal russo. Il russo deve aspettare il momento giusto per infliggere attacchi e fiaccare la produzione tedesca. L’inverno è vicino. :-)

The game has innovative systems for a Block game, as the Air Units; and has mechanics which are rather innovative compared to other products of the Block Games marked (namely Eurofront and Europe Engulfed). 

It has huge pluses in my eyes as the capturing enemy war material (when their units are Out of Supply) and has an interesting operational level of doing things.

On the other hand has major hindrances, namely a crippled air vs land system due; a production system which has a background issue favoring infantry production over anything else when defending; and mostly being unbalanced in favor of the Soviets, well able to reach Western Poland in early '43 with a Germany unable to do anything during snow turns and subsequent summers.

Ultimately the game is enjoyable the first times you play it - as you explore it; but once firm grips are taken of the system it is extremely onesided past '41 which makes it tedious; without the historical swing of offensive and counteroffensive.

Really love the look and feel of the game.  We set up and played from the beginning, 1941.  In most East Front games that I have played, many hundreds, the Russians barely hold on with heavy losses and the Germans feel they can push deep into Russia. In the other games the Russians don't get many replacements or reinforcements early but finally in Sept they start rolling in and are just barely able to stop the Germans at the gates of Moscow. What we found with the Russians they get hordes of replacements immediately and replace all their losses.  With the Germans not being able to attack more than 1 hex away in the BLITZ Phase, the Russian just puts up a row of cheap units and backs up 2 hexes.  The Russian builds large units and the Germans are looking at a massive army.  It seems the 1941 scenario was not play tested very much. I am just now finishing 6 months of play testing another new game and think it will be great, but it takes time.
  I am hoping the 2.1 rules will help out and we will try again.  I think the game has great potential and will raise my score if it works.

Players represent either the Axis or Soviets forces, fighting out the Eastern Front campaigns during World War II.  Lovely looking block game, much larger than the venerable EastFront in terms of size and components, but in many ways a simpler game.   The rules come in three levels of complexity, tuned to the scenario being played - you get fast playing simple games all the way up to full sized monsters.  

The main impression is this game is a lovely production from a small, enthusiastic company.  The components are excellent (perhaps the map is a little busy to my eyes), and the rules are very easy to pick up.  A final word on the Collector's Edition - this is an amazing item - the complete game stored inside a replica 88mm artillery shell - truly an amazing product right up there with the War of the Ring Collector's Edition (which it sits right next to!).

RATING: 6
initial rating just based on rules read and set up. I will update once i've played.

The visual design for this game is fairly horrible. The map is sort of ugly and visually jarring which would be fine if it was a case of function over form. It isn't, finding borders and setup zones is not easy and lots of blocks are listed as set up in various towns which means time scouring the board for some Russian location. Also the hexes are too small for the stacking limit. Hopefully there will be a pay off.

---------------------------

only solo'd three turns so take my impressions with a pinch.

Not sold on this one. The game has production issues even beyond those mentioned above. For instance, the chart showing what each tech of unit hits on is printed in the middle of the map. Fine, but then after craning my neck to see it for several combats I wish they had printed it on a player aid.

I had hoped the number of blocks would increase the narrative detail. It might well do, but i cannot see the blocks, they are so tightly packed into their small hexes its difficult to generate any clear picture of what is going on.

These issues might well disappear with time investment, but with the amount of effort that is being demanded for what is essentially a simple and fairly standard block system, i'm not sure its worth it. The main reason to consider this game is if you want a block game that simulates production and oil resources. This is interesting but it boils down to accounting plus finding the block you are looking for in the forest of crap on the board.

RATING: 9.9
This game captivated me, and the more I play it the more impressed I am. It incorporates the tried and true basic structure of a block game with some subtle but very potent new ideas in a seamless fashion. It's production system strikes the perfect balance (for my taste) between depth and ease of use. The advanced game with optional rules is a tremendous example of elegance in game design. I find that a great deal of thought is required in the decision making process, and care must be given to many facets such as supply lines, potential counterattacks, etc. The actual game play is quite smooth in my plays of the game as a solo experience. The designer is lightning fast in replying to questions. I just don't know of any game I like any more than this, except perhaps Napoleon's Triumph.

Splendidly complete simulation game.
Took 4 hours of intense warfare to let my opponent (USSR) win - couldn't complete, I'm not that superb commander.

Historically accurate down to the bone, this boardgame makes a very good impression by using high quality parts. As part as the visual look is concerned, it's quite impressive.

High quality parts.
Great job guys, keep on!

RATING: 10
If there is a better game out there on the Eastern Front which allows a player to control the strategic and operational direction of the war (whether playing German or Soviet), I haven't seen it - and I have most of them sitting on my shelves collecting dust.  While the game system itself is relatively simple, the decisions that have to be made are complex.  The production system used in the game forces one to think about priorities and goals not only in the short term but in the long term as well.  There is very little scripted here which forces one to follow a predetermined path.  What more could one ask for?  The enjoyment of playing an Eastern Front game is to see what the two sides really had to work with and how each could react to the other's actions and intentions.  The siutation is epic and Blocks in the East is too.  It is a blast to play - and works very very well solitaire.  This will be the one game that will be saved from the flames of the fire when the house is burning down.  The fate of the others will be left to the fire department.

Excellent: Eastern Front - strategic / operational - WWII

I own two copies, boxed version & tube version.

Plus:
-Incredible value; surprisingly affordable considering the amount of blocks and quality map.
-EastFront on steroids: more hexes and more blocks provide more choices / options.
-Excellent customer support;
-Accessible and extremely fun East-front game.
-Beautiful map.
-Surprisingly realistic without chrome to achieve this.
-Plays quickly.

Minus:
-More blocks means more time investment; despite the quick play, sessions take a bit longer than EastFront. For me not an issue but it might be for some.
-First edition city names have errors (2nd edition much improved!)
-1st edition: not clear which stickers to put on which color blocks (onlne support solves this!)

I saw this game by accident on an Essen Geeklist and Pre orderd and will pick it up in Essen. As an avid EastFront fan I am really curious how this redevelopment plays. Looks very impressive and comes in a tube.

Halfway through my first game; great feel and more options than in EastFront. If you think the Russians are done, another red wall arises in front of you...this must how German commanders must have felt....

Wow, map is sublime, options are numerous. Not sure if this will dethrone EastFront but a strong contender for sure. A unique experience in a way that it has never been done on this scale. Two massive walls of blocks facing eachother. 

The great thing is that the tides can turn quickly each turn.

Great stuff, still learning more, moreover enjoying it more!

Mind you this game can be played based on me being familiar with East Front. Player who are not familiar with EastFront might have difficulty with the current rules set (first edition).

Update: the 2nd edition rules are a major improvement!

I read about gamers who don't like the game because of the crowded hexes; EastFront and Bobby Lee suffer from this and either the map will be humongous OR you put blocks from battle hexes on the side and place a die in the hex. 
EastFront deals with this by providing A,B,C,...F chits.

Overcrowding apllies only to a few hexes at the same time and for me this is an absolute non issue. The systems works great and if you want you can either use dice or chits from EastFront or purchase the goretex map, which has larger hexes.

Best way to judge for yourself is by looking at some session reports with pictures or video's. I'm used to large stacks of counters (the great war, Schlieffen Plan, OCS) and I find blocks much easier to handle.

ok, starting this game today! Jan 15-2013. stunning modern art, superb materials (goretex map), clear rules.
I do need to dig deeper but it looks like a VERY thematic WWII block game.

Could it challenge Eastfront? [update Oct 2013]- very different playing than EFII.

for now a solid 8 for a Block Game. 2nd best block game I have played.

I picked up the Goretex map! wow. This adds value. I bumped up the score to 8.5. While the map gets a bit crowded, there is a lot to like here. I have mentioned elsewhere it feels like a lite OCS! Supply and planning are important. I played the training scenario with a friend 40 minutes, he had a cool time. I have several plays done now... still peeling the onion on this

We have found it to be boring and really odd in comparison to EastFront II. For example strange AA rules where tank unit can wipe aircrafts from sky. I have read designers thought on this but do not agree.

Also strange hierarchy of HQs.

From all of this EastFront and its system does provide better history with less rules.

Also due to stacking limits front hexes are always overcrowded which severely hampers gameplay.

I would say this was one of my biggest dissapoitments especially when reading all enthusiastic comments.

Pros: Great components, finally a solid ruleset, good helpsheets, unique customer support. The designer is always around and open minded. He did a great job until now, and perhaps BITE will become a modern block wargame classic.
Cons: The normal map is a little bit too small for all the units in their frontline hexes, the blocks are smaller than those from EastFront II, the AA can be very strong.

This game needs some serious rules revisions and clarifications. The components are not very functional as is, but that's not something I think is as easily fixed. This game was clearly released before it was ready. 

Edit: I have read the updated rules and I am not even remotely satisfied with the changes. The need for updated stickers, not just a few, but a whole sheet as well as some other fixes just proves that this game should have never been released.
The fact that the designer is so concerned over the BGG ratings is ridiculous. He should be focusing on fixing this game, and not in increments, as a whole.

A fantastic game with numerous scenarios and a great campaign. You can learn the basic game rules with 3 introductory scenarios for group north, group center and group South in june 41. These simple scenarios are interesting to try different stratégies to open Barbarossa before trying a longer scenario or the campaign game.
The components are great and come with a very complete order of battle. There is a serious historical research behind this game.
For me, it's a perfect game for historical interest, playability and replayability, complexity and playing time.
Thanks a lot Emanuele!

At last it's here - This is an easily-played in-depth treatment of the war in the East from Barbarossa to the fall of Berlin. I also own East Front II, so I don't say this lightly. The components of my limited edition are marvellous and the map is a beauty to behold. If I have one complaint it is that my poor eyesight has some trouble with the 15mm x 15mm blocks but, it doesn't affect my enjoyment of this game. The more I play this, the better it becomes. It is actually a very subtle game with enough nuances to keep the most discriminating Grognard satisfied. I cannot recommend it highly enough.

RATING: 6
January 2013: Rating a 6 for now. I really wanted to love this game! Gorgeous production. Huge massive map. What really attracted me to this game is the amount of blocks included, about 300, which looks very impressive when the game is setup.

But as with many block games, the blocks themselves are too small for the board, especially with the stacking limit of 4 blocks/hex.

In general, the rules that make this game unique feels more like chrome than add to the strategic depth. We didn't feel that the HQ rules to active units added much to the game, nor did the different types of currencies/resources players can earn and spend. 

The game also felt like an awkward blend of a block game and a traditional hex-and-counter game. For example, for a game of this size, I would've expected more strict zone-of-control rules. Instead, ZOC only affects supply. Combat in a typical block game usually takes several rounds, but there aren't many battles per turn. In this game, you could have ten or more fights per turn. In your typical hex-and-counter game, each of those battles would be resolved with only one die roll. So battle starts to feel repetitive quickly in this game.  

To summarize, I think the game is probably better with the basic rules than the advanced ones. The depth of the game itself seems on the level of Axis and Allies rather than EastFront. The advanced rules add chrome to the game rather than strategic depth.


November 2012: I'm reserving my rating until I fully understand the rules.

Based on one partial game.

The rulebook has glaring omissions such as on which blocks to stick the stickers, and the setup for the Barbarossa scenario (almost every scenario in the rule booklet refers to this setup). Fortunately, the designer is on BGG and answers questions promptly.

There are still many issues we couldn't figure out; we'll planning to post these questions on BGG soon.

As for components, we thought the hexes were way too small for the blocks. The stickers in this game are much more difficult to apply than a typical Columbia Games war game. The blocks are smaller, and the stickers are harder to peel off the backing paper.

As for the game itself, I'm hoping that once we've figured out the rules, it will be simple and fast moving; that's the impression we got so far.

Ein Spiel eines neuen, italienischen Publishers (VentoNuovo Games), das nur auf den ersten Blick eine erweiterte Variante des Blockspielklassikers „EastFront II“ (Columbia) darstellt. Das grobe Szenario (Rußlandfeldzug) ist identisch; zum einen jedoch fällt die immense Sorgfalt auf, welche auf die Komponenten (Spielblöcke bzw. Aufkleber, Regelwerk und insbesondere die große, laminierte Karte) verwandt wurde; zum zweiten ist das Game sozusagen dreistufig zu ‚erspielen‘: Es gibt Basis-Regeln, die (mit Blick auf den Umfang des Spieles) rasch und leicht zu erlernen sind, dann Advanced Rules, die sozusagen einen Gang Realismus zuschalten (z.B. detailliertere Supply-Regeln), schließlich modular verwendbare, optionale Regeln, mit denen man einfach experimentieren kann oder auch nicht. Zwei weitere Vorzüge: Akzeptable Spieldauer (bei Einzelszenarien, max. zwei Stunden); ein (in Relation zu vielen Columbia-Blockgames) abgewandeltes und m.E. auch etwas besseres Kampfsystem.
Lobenswert ist ferner der prompte und freundliche Kundenservive: Mir fehlte ein grüner Block; nach einer Mail an E. Santandrea fand ich einen Ersatzblock ein paar Tage später in der Post.

very simple to learn the game and the short duration, to more complex scenarios or the length epic.
Good components, I bought the limited edition and I'm proud.

RATING: 8
I have played this game a couple of times and the fun factor is just getting better with each play. This game improves were in my opinion Eastfront (II) was limited. I have played East/West/Eurofront II, Asian and Europe Engulfed. As a block wargame, this game can be best compared with Eastfront II.

1) Costs are spread between different kind of units. 
With Eastfront II I found it very difficult to play as the axis as almost all PP went straight to the HQs. 
When the axis goes to war they are blessed with oil capacity in BITE. And you do not pay for infantry/cavalry and artillery movement which is much better.  The new purchasing system which is limited to certain resources may let you think twice as Germany to rush all tanks blitzing.

2) More is better. 
The amount of blocks makes a setup time consuming however this makes the game very dynamic.  Instead of HQ activation and airstriking 1 area you can attack with planes on multiple locations. You also have bomber and fighters which creates various gameplay. I also like the artillery units in the game and the diversity of units. The capacity and diversity of units with 7-5-3-1 step counter is very interesting to play with and well designed. 

3) New elements to the game.
The units begin a certain Tech level, which makes it very painful for the Russians during the summer of 1941. Tanks/infantry are slower for the Russians and counterattacking is at least until the winter (and even then) very frustrating. Also considering activating planes could be costly for the Russians with a reduced Tech level. It would make you Stalin himself if you see how easy the axis advance, which really resembles the feeling  the Russians had in 1941.
Surrender is also a nice add to the game with a bonus that you receive additional PP for every unit destroyed.
Not to mention all optional rules to tune down the game, just that also less experienced player can keep up with more experienced players.

Update 07-12-2013: After more gameplays, the planes in the spring and summer time with the AA seems correct. I was prejudged with this ealier statement, as the German income exceeds often the sovjets after May 1942 and can manage the losses. The sovjets should be careful to use planes until tech lvl 2. 

I recommend all players of East front II to give this edition at least a try. While it doesn’t have the depth in rules for example in combat it has more far variability and is easier to memorize and has a lot of fresh updates, which makes the WWII environment even more dynamic as EFII. 

A lot of fresh rules without leaving much of the basic gameplay which made Eastfront II as successful game as it is today. Keep up the good work and excellent customer support.

RATING: 7.8
A poorly written rulebook, meant this did not get a play for four years.
After the release of the third updated book I finally got this on the table.
 
Once the rules are sorted, the game has many good qualities that make you want to keep on playing.

Historical accuracy is excellent and done in a granular way to make this more like a game than a simulation. 
It is possible to change the course of the war and even have the Axis win.
The combat rules for the different unit types are great and give you tactical depth.
Supply rules take into account fuel and ammo as well as unit strengths, so that the correct path to victory is not always obvious.
The short scenarios offer an easy learning curve through the Basic rules.
There are many advanced and optional rules to add flavor and detail to your game once you start the long scenarios.
And ... Solo play is easy to implement.

I do have to admit I am enjoying the game a lot more than i thought I would. :D
The game design has a great way of simulating the historic conditions, even though there is some abstractions. 
The map seems to be cramped, even when using only a few units, so investing in the larger maps is a good idea.

RATING: 7
I bought the game based mostly out of curiosity to see how the components and colorful bits would add or subtract to an otherwise straightforward Eastern Front game.  Like most block games, this one suffers from the "hexes too small for the blocks" syndrome.  This issue is always horribly problematic in any Barbarossa enactment when the mass of German blocks approaches infinite density.  After setting up the 1941 scenario, I simply could not tell which hex my blocks were in, other then inference by stacking limits.  I was tempted to simply press the entire mass together and move them in one herculean thrust into the wall of red blocks.  I then used a Jenga-style house rule for scoring hits:  if a red block fell over, it was eliminated. (just kidding) .  I will continue to fiddle with the game to see how it unfolds during play.

Sold. I wasn't impressed with the components. I already own EastFront II, which is an *excellent* block war-game and have a friend that owns EuroFront II. I also have a few WWII-themed war-games ordered on the GMT P500 list so there just isn't any room for this one in my collection.

I think this game has a good mix of features that make it both a simple or more complex depending on the setting and both a quick or more longer depending on the scenario, obviously with a well written rulebook and one of the best quality components I have ever seen that makes it really beautiful and fun for every kind of player.

Blocks in the East honors its name because on the one hand what we find first when we open the box is a big bag filled with blocks of wood. Along with them, there are two maps, stickers, plastic factories, a good number of different coloured wood cubes, dice and some little plastic discs.

All the materials are good quality. I love the map: it's got lots of information but everything is well combined and has a very nice look. I don't know if I like the fact that the tables are impressed on it; it's very useful, everything needed for playing is there next to you so you save space though sometimes it seems to me someone has written over a Botticelli.

There are different views questioning if the hexes are big enough to stack up the blocks. In truth, there isn't too much to stack and when you have to stack or in the case of big battles, you can reuse army signs from other games or improvise homemade ones. To me this is not a problem.

What I like the less are the Partisans plastic discs. It can become hard, if you are not a fiddler like me, to manage them. This is again a minor problem which can be easily solved in Blocks in the West where wood discs are used instead.

Rules are structured in three sections: BASIC, ADVANCED AND OPTIONAL. I think this is a great for in design since it can help inexperienced players as an introduction to wargaming. This, along with the good quantity of sceneries the game provides, makes it not difficult to find a combination which suits our own time for playing. Anyway, even using all the rules, you don't feel overwhelmed by them.

What I love of BITE is that it's an easy to play game, though complex and difficult to master. I love how it combines a high scale planning and the need to face local problems like the Sevastopol or Leningrad occupation; it makes possible to damage the enemy economy, to cross the Donnets or the Dniepr...

It's a highly "narrative" wargame, this being helped by the map aesthetic, the contrast of the blocks in the front, the factories and the resource cubes. It may seem strange to find in a wargame the typical eurogame resource cubes which them even working. They are very helpful to carry out the contability of production, making very visual/graphic the quantity of resources which you have at hand, and in many an ocassion painfully showing their lack. Moreover, you can play with the cubes to calm down while you clearly see how you are about to lose a whole panzer corps.

Another of the fors of the design is how, in an easy way, the differences between the two parties are shown. The German at the beginning have a technological advantage but limited resources whereas the soviets start with a common army but they have lots of raw material. The German know the technological advantage is lost as time passes by so they can't stop in their progress. This progress is difficult to achieve because of the fuel expenses shown through the use of barrels which are turned into the HQs steps. This handicap hangs over Germany during all the game, and the German player has to decide carefully what he is going to use each petrol barrel for.

In conclusion, Blocks in the East seems to me like a breath of fresh air into the world of Second War World games. I'm willing to see the three games together: East, West and Afrika.

Innanzitutto un grande inchino per la QUALITÁ dei materiali: non capita mai di trovare una mappa e della componentistica simile, in un gioco da tavolo!

Poi un grande plauso va al customer care: ti rispondono in un attimo, ti aggiornano gratis il gioco alla 2 edizione se avevi comprato la prima, ti "seguono" a 360 gradi: se penso a come son stati trattati gli acquirenti di axis and allies pacific (le miniature non bastavano manco per il setup iniziale) ha dell' INCREDIBILE, questa casa editrice.

Infine il regolamento: premesso che NON sono un amante del fronte russo (e infatti non vedo l' ora che escano gli altri giochi di questa serie), come si fa a non amare questo gioco??

É praticamente perfetto: il neofita viene guidato per mano fino ad integrare lentamente le regole avanzate; l' appassionato di storia militare non puó non apprezzare l' ENORME ricerca storica effettuata dall' autore, che si nota in OGNI piú piccolo dettaglio (per esempio la disponibilitá di carburante é tutt' altro che casuale).

Excellent supply system mechanics. Germans must protect their armor assets from getting destroyed as the can only be reinforced but not rebuilt. Easy and advanced rules allow you to tailor the game to your taste. Lots of scenarios. Incredible map size, graphics, and lots of wood in this game. Rules are online.

Stunning quality, waiting for my first play.  Rating bases on components quality for the time being. I would love to see the same oil barrels as in BITW. Support from the designer is first class.

A potentially great game but some wonky rules - e.g. aircraft on ground or depleted artillery prevent armor units from exploiting - really mar it for me.  Now after my third game I understand it, but have to master different approaches than I am used to in strategic games like this, e.g. use your airforce as nukes on rear units, not to support your ground unit attacks.  If stuff like that does not bother you then the game is a real gem.

Don't like the creator's attitude versus criticism, but I can't argue the fact I had great fun playing this.

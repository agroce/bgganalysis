A simple deck builder with an original theme - a divorce settlement among rabbit royalty.  I say it is simple because most (all?) of the time you are drawing blind to add to your deck and because there is no need for deck thinning in this game as you can use your whole hand each round, time permitting.  Lots of take away and store (discard until end of game scoring) actions mean that your deck is ever-changing.  So, some of the time things will come together nicely and at others they won't.  Game play resolves into a tug of war for control of five courtiers.  Get a courtier on your side, or at least not actively hostile, and they will grant some quite powerful actions.  It's interesting that those actions differ according to which faction the courtier inherently favours.  There is scope to sequence plays cleverly and to pull the rug out from under your opponent.  And yet it does seem to go on a bit and fairly repetitively at that.  

Production quality is fine.  The art on the cards is either endearingly childlike or a bit crap, depending on taste.  The English rules are well written and clear.

RATING: 7.5
Very cool and very cutthroat 2-player game. I liked it overall and there is one single complaint, the lack of a catching up mechanism in the game. Will play again.

RATING: 7.5
The rules are a bit confusing at first but one play should be enough to figure everything out. Most confusing is at first it's unclear how you get cards to build your deck. It's not made very clear that your deck grows each round and the initial round does not have very many possible actions.  After figuring that part out I found the game highly enjoyable.

Initial Impressions:
-----------------------
Probably the heaviest micro game since Sail to India.  The theme in this one is... different, but actually interesting since I have never seen anything else like it.  The hand management / building is interesting, and you will never be able to do everything you want to do.  I will probably get in a few more plays of this one since the wife does seem to enjoy it, but still on the fence about now much I liked it.

The game feels slightly arbitrary, since the decks are randomly allocated among the characters. However, the ebb and flow of influencing and seeking counsel allows for some clever tactics.

Un juego de cartas para dos jugadores bastante ameno que ganará conforme más se conozcan las habilidades de las cartas. El tema es muy original pero durante el juego apenas estás pendiente de ello.

This is really good! Like a very fast Twilight Struggle with cards and, well, divorcing rabbits. Jockey for position and score while the state is in your favour. A tentative mark until I play it more.

Might have potential but didnt discover it yet. It's asymmetric, pretty much random deck builder. Fluff is awsome, but I don't get the visual aspect of the game. It is aesthetic, but childish-like drawings plus sometimes a lot of text on cards aren't best aspect of the game.

RATING: 8
Asymmetrical wich makes it unique. Kune can win but only by being a total pig from the get go, oink:) Abbot seemed over poverful but also can be handled. Maybe themevise this is actually a bunny mob family.

Some tough decisions in this unusual filler.

Probably should have had a vikings or pirate theme. Instead of bunnies getting a divorce..

RATING: 5
Well. The game is marvelous. The graphics are great. The mechanics fantastic. But... it's an asymetrical card game that has not been balanced properly, unfortunately. Otherwise the note would be probably 8-8,5. But the thing is that you cannot win with Kune. Simply cannot.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I was really surprised by how much I enjoyed this game. It has a lot of depth for such a cute little game.

I'm even more surprised by comments around how Kune cannot win the game, since even as a new player, I've managed to win with him each time I've played with him. You just have to figure out when to start storing cards (late), and you can take good advantage of conversion abilities to undo all of Lakia's influence, especially late in the round.

Great 'tug of war' card game... the battle between 2 divorcing royal rabbits. I usually don't like cutthroat games, but this is a very nice one :-)

RATING: 7.2
wonderful title.  With carrot meeples!  Surprisingly engaging push/pull game of influencing members of court.  You build a little deck, playing cards either to influence characters and gain more cards or claim courtesies from favoring court members.  Enough going on with some fresh mechanisms to be interesting but does not overstay its welcome.  Nice artwork as well.

RATING: 5
A decent 2p dueling game. It's really neat to mix deck building with take-that and area control (I guess?).

Really awesome asymmetric abilities and scoring.

The theme sounds fun initially, and it shines through on the cards, but the gameplay doesn't really feel like it. I think this theme would do a bit better in a Vladimír Suchý game like Last Will.

The big turn-off was the vast amounts of card text you had to read, memorize, and when you get down to it, the card abilities weren't really that interesting.

Not a bad game but a pass for me.

we weren't sure what this was about from the explanation, but I liked the rabbit artwork, and it was pretty cheap. This is a pretty good game, much deeper than we thought. The designer clarified our rules question - each player always keeps 5 properties, so if you lose one to the other player, they have to give you one in return.

Wow that is a long title. cute 2p game about divorcing bunnies. Card driven tug of war game. I thought it was super cute but not really a game we would play enough. There are definitely some interesting ideas and trying to turn the court to be in your favor. activating special cards to do other actions. It is fun!

All in all pretty good and I would play again.

Oh no, Royal Lapine Divorce simulator! This game has a LOT of moving pieces and blocks of information you either have to constantly check, built a spreadsheet for, or memorize. Once you overcome that obstacle and the games strange asymmetry, it's a rather interesting game of card acquisition and tableau manipulation.

An interesting deck-builder. Duke Kune and Princess Lakia are duking (I'm so sorry) it out and are dragging their powerful friends and relatives into it. This is a nasty little card game about influencing nobles to your side during a nasty little divorce. 

Using a small deck of cards, each player influences a small cast of characters (which allows switching allegiances and drawing cards to build your deck), plots against the other (action cards), or uses special actions of those on their side. 

It's a clever game, and I've been enjoying it so far. As a deck-builder, it stands out from most in that you draw face-down cards instead of a wide variety of known face-up cards. While that takes a ton of control over building decks, there aren't any useless cards. Players also use their entire deck every round, which isn't as crazy as it sounds.

The tug-of-war battle between influencing the Courtiers was interesting, and was a constant battle until the last card played. This is where a lot of the take-that comes into play. One player may play a card or cards to change allegiance, and the very next turn your opponent may undo it. 

This weird card game fits the theme perfectly, and the delightful artwork just makes it better.

Really enjoyed this and keen to play more. Think it is one that will really benefit from a few plays once players are familiar with the abilities of all the courtiers and various cards.

Excellent theme and artwork really help.

And the craziest game theme award goes too... This two player deck builder divorce between Duke rabbit and Princess bunny.  Drafting cards and managing a see-saw battle of area control for the husband's and wife's oft changing support of their friends, family, and court in the central display.  Unique play with some nasty surprises.

RATING: 7.5
This is really a unique little game and a smart mix of a bunch of different types of card games. It’s a tiny bit rough around the edges, but it makes up for that in charm and intelligence. Rounds get more and more interesting, as your deck (which is simultaneously your full hand) grows, leading to more combo possibilities. I definitely want to play again to explore the game more. Not to mention the artwork and carrot meeples are absolutely adorable, of course.

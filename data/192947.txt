A fun gambling-style game with just enough player control to make the whole thing interesting.  The dynamic of the camels that ride along other camels is really fun and makes for a lot of kooky unpredictable moments.  Good fun in a small package.

I've not played the original board game so do not have basis for comparison, but I tried this card-based version for the first time yesterday and had an absolute blast. At 2 player it was bundles of fun, yet I wonder how the experience might change with more players seeing as the control over the outcomes is lessened. The only downsides here were the fiddly setup and the high frequency of card shuffling - that aside this is a highly enjoyable and recommended gaming experience. A keeper for sure! 

Update: Second game - I lost horribly and still enjoyed it immensely!

I only put this to the table once, but it worked so well that we played 3 times in a row. 

There were 6 of us and we had a lot of fun.

To point up a few negatives, the game takes some space, not too much, but it will take as much space as any regular game with a board. The other negative is that at the very beginning it can seem a little hard to grasp, specially the deck building process. However you get used to the mechanics fast, and as it is a short game, so you can play again.

Soon you will find your group cheering and applauding, and in the final round is possible that that noise turns into a tense silence, as the camels sprint to the finish line.

I liked a lot, I liked also that players do not have very direct ways to hinder directly other players, something that usually ends up disrupting most of our games.

Of course is not a very serious game, but you will be very surprised of how much head scratching there are when deciding cards to discard or even when choosing between the available actions, which are at most 4 possible ones.

The game is random but you have some information, so you can do a little planning. You know your card and six of the twelve cards of the deck. You also know the bets of your opponents. SO there is a little space for planning.

Our three games where between the 30-60 min range in the box. The second one was just 30 minutes, and the last and longer one did not take much more tahn 45 minutes. I guess there is the possibility for the game to drag, specially in two player games, but for more it seem that it will go more or less quick.

Recommended, at least with six players.

To me it has the same feel as Camel up plus the card play is nice because you can mitigate the outcome a little bit. Some people find the card play complicated for no reason. That's not true. you do the same sequence over and over so it easy to grasp. Also I agree that the money cards is a bad choice but I use money tokens from another game. Overall I think I would ratter play the card version over the dice one. Plus I prefer small and portable games in my collection.

Actually a fine game. But falls into that odd gap between a quick and easy filler and being a bit thinky, making it a bit long for what it is. The charm of the original game is the non-intuitive nature of the probability distribution. Now you are dealing with a bit of hidden-info challenge.

How this gets a lot of flak I do not know because Camel Up Cards is fantastic!

Yes it's a bit fiddly with the cards, yes there is a bit of setup and yes it has a stupidly large table footprint for such a small-boxed game but holy fun-buckets it pays back in game-play.

Cards offers a lot of control and strategy to the game; long-gone is the beloved dice temple, instead replaced by a deck of cards players get to build, so you will have a fair idea of what's in there but by no means do they get the complete picture.  It is a lot less chaotic but there is still tension, upsets and surprises in the outcome.

While this game is fairly easy to play I would not recommend this version for kids, definitely stick to the original for that.

Nagyon kellemes meglepetés volt. Elsőre bonyolultnak tűnt a szabály, pláne ahhoz képest, amire számítottunk, de játszani már pofonegyszerű. Zseniálisan van kitaláva a hiányos információból való játék. Rengeteg benne persze a véletlen, illetve a nehezen kalkulálható dolog. De pont annyi infó van, hogy megéri kicsit agyalni. Nagyon szórakoztató, a játékidőhöz mértem pont megfelelő komolyságú darab.
Egyetlen fájdalom, hogy a aránylag sok hely kell neki, ráadásul ezer helyre kell kártyákat kirakni, így egyáltalán nem strandjáték kategória, pedig minden másban nagyon megfelelne ennek.

Perhaps a bit too fiddly for what I was hoping would be a streamlined version of the parent game. Nonetheless, it packs small, and the card mechanics actually make it a bit more strategic/controllable compared to the dice mechanic utilised in the parent game.

I heavily dislike Camel Up so I was very wary to try its new incarnation. To my surprise, Camel Up Cards is MUCH better than the parent game, it still isn’t for me though, but at least now you have some meaningful decisions to make.

The rules are pretty simple, you can explain them under 6 minutes. Playtime varies a lot but the game moves at a quick pace.

The art of the cards is pretty good as are the game´s components. 

In general, I don’t like racing games so I was predisposed to dislike Camel Up Cards but it surprised me a bit because I feel it is a much better game than Camel Up. At the beginning of each turn you have to play two cards into the mix, you show one and the other you play hidden. By doing this, you actually have some hard data in which to base your moves, so it isn’t all luck like its big brother. Camel Up Cards still have a lot of luck, but at least now you can take informed guesses. Other ways to control the luck factor are the palm tree and the fox. 

Bottom line, I was surprised by Camel Up Cards, it is a better game than Camel Up in every way but it is still a very simple game and way too light for my current tastes. Luck is still very high but the decisions needed to play the game aren’t pure guesses like in the past. In many (most?) instances the best play is readily obvious. I already sold my copy of the game. I think camel Up Cards can be a good game to introduce new people to our hobby.

Awful twist on the original. A card game version is supposed to be quicker and less fiddly than the original. This is somehow the opposite, due to all the overhead between laps (drafting, resetting the board, etc.). There is zero reason to play this, just go for the original.

Jeder Spieler erhält X Karten auf die Hand, wirft Y davon ab und legt Z Karten auf einen gemeinsamen Zugstapel. Am Etappenanfang wird dieser gut durchgemischt und wer an der Reihe ist kann entweder eine Karte ziehen, die einzig verbliebene Handkarte ausspielen oder Palme (Bonus) oder Fuchs (malus) auf die Strecke stellen. Zusätzlich darf der Spieler dann eine Wette abschliessen, welches Kamel sich am Ende der Etappe vorne und welches sich im Mittelfeld befindet oder eine Wette über das Kamel das am Ende des Spiels erster/letzter wird.
Liegt man man Etappen-/Spielende richtig, hagelt es Geld (Siegpunkte), liegt man falsch muss man zahlen.
Es ist ein sehr schön einfachen und unkompliziertes Wettspiel, bei dem man (bei 2 Spielern) die Hälfte der Karten kennt, die das Rennen beinflussen, dabei aber immernoch etwas Glücksabhängig ist, wann welche Karte aufgedeckt wird.
Das Spiel ist aber kurz genug um den Glücksfaktor egal werden zu lassen. Mit den richtigen Karten kann man ein Ende des Spiels auch forcieren, nur die Wetten müssen dann auch richtig abgeschlossen sein.
Ich finde es ein tolles Spiel, habe aber seinen Brettspiel-Vorgänger nie gespielt und kann daher keine Vergleiche ziehen.

First, you need to enjoy a tad bit of chaos, if you're going to like Camel Up (card and/or board game version).  You'll never be able to fully control the outcome of the game, but that's what makes it fun.  There is enough information in both games to make educated bets, but things don't always go as planned.  That's where the tension and excitement of the games comes in.   

In this version, you appear to have a tad bit more control over the outcome of the game compared to the board game version.  There's a 30 card deck made up of five +1 movement cards and one +2 movement card for each camel.  It's shuffled up and you get a number of cards (varies by # of players).  Of the cards you receive, you'll decide which ones to discard and which ones to put into the movement deck.  So, going into each leg of the race, you have an idea of which camels will be moving, but you won't know the whole deck.  It allows you to make fairly educated bets, but there will still be some uncertainty to how the race will play out.  On top of that, you'll potentially be able to manipulate the camels movement with the fox (-1 movement if landed on) and palm tree cards (+1 movement if landed on), but be careful you lose a coin, if it's still on the board at the end of the leg.  

Very clever game.  I haven't played it enough to determine if it's better than the original, but I'm impressed so far.  It gives you a lot more options to manipulate the camels.  It will take a couple of games to be able to play this well, but luckily it's a quick playing game.

If you enjoyed the original, you'll probably find something to enjoy about the card game version.  If you were turned off a bit by the chaos of the original (even though it gives you a lot of info to make smart bets, too), give this one a try unless you can't tolerate any chaos.  Don't go into this expecting a simpler game because it's a "card game" version of the original.  You're still making a lot of the same type of decisions and can have a bigger impact on the outcome of the game.

FUN: offers more control than the boardgame on which it is based, but is still unpredictable enough to allow exciting twists. I can see this getting played with everyone I usually play games with.

UNIQUE:  it's a cardgame that is better and offers more choices than the boardgame on which it is based.

NEGATIVES: obviously loses some of the visiual appeal of the boardgame.

This is less of a stand alone game and more of an attempt to translate everything that is Camel Up the board game into a card game format. The advantages to this are the obvious portability improvement along with a card management system that actually allows for a bit of strategy during the game. But this comes at the price of the cool presentation that the larger version has, as well as being a little harder to read on the tabletop as everything is on a card.

It's more strategic than the original but therefore it's also taking away a lot of the things that makes the original more enjoyable to play: the unpredictability of the dice. So, OK I get that it adds more strategy into the game but it also takes away the fun with it...

An easy to follow and quick betting manipulation game that plays up to six and doesn't drag between turns. What's not to like? There's enough control to have a bit of fun and not groan about your luck. Funny and unpredictable moves will occur. The fox and the palm tree addition to slow down and accelerate movement are a top idea. I especially like that there's no negative cards to make the game drag. Take one of my favourite kids games - Schildkroetenrennen - and spice it up considerably with some betting. A good family game and way more enjoyable than I found the board game version to be.

Wow - the original is fun, but this is far more interesting with a lot of the minor issues from Camel Up ironed out. The Fennec/Palm Tree works better than the oasis tiles, and the betting is more informed, and, with open race betting, far more tense. Great game in a small box.
The rules are straight forward and simple (ok, not as simple as the boardgame, but still easy to follow) and the setup for each leg is quick (shuffle a deck of cards, and deal them out, return the leg bet cards, each play discards, and then reveals a card).

RATING: 4
Kids didn't really dug the betting mechanic. As for strategy, you simply don't get enough information to make any good prediction on the camels, other then your opponents betting behaviour. In which case, you're already late to the party due to the diminishing value of bets. Add in some dull 'move one forward' and 'stay where you are' mechanic by the palm and fox and you even have convoluted the design for a game that should be faster and more accessible as it's boxed variant.

Nothing to see here, tries to lift on the surprising Spiel des Jahres win of his bigger brother. There are better race games.

Camel Up Cards is a small box version of the hit-game Camel Up by designer Steffen Bogen, for 2 to 6 players. If you like the original Camel Up, you’ll enjoy this games. Instead of dice, it uses a draw deck of cards to move the camels. You will be able to have some control on the contents of the deck by stacking the deck, which makes for a more interesting game. The race track is also laid out using cards, and you will be able to dynamically change the length of the track mid-game to keep the race tight. I also like the new wooden fennec and oasis maples which replaces the mirage and oasis cards in the game. They are now used purely to affect the race. One thing I did not like was how it uses cards (and rotating cards) to keep track of your money. Inclusion of cardboard coins like in the original would have much improved the record keeping. I’ll definitively be adding my own coin counters to my copy of the game. The dice and the pyramid were cool in the original, but I think this is a better game from a game-play perspective. If you like the original Camel Up, this is a perfect addition to your collection for a portable version of the game.

Jól szórakoztam, de alapvetően nem az én játékom, mondjuk menekülni se fogok, ha előkerül valamikor a társaságban.

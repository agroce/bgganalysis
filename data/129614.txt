Some interesting decisions, but the game was never exciting.  The production value is good...almost too good for such a simple game!  Not a color-blind-friendly game.  It did seem to slow down toward the end when the decisions became less interesting.

RATING: 8.5
As a game for a casual group, Rondo is fantastic.  A near 10.  One of the guys in my casual gaming group described it as the "perfect game for a rainy weekend at the cottage".  By that he meant it is a game that can be played over and over and over and remain interesting and fun in each play.  I agree!  

However, I struggle to give such a casual game a rating higher than 8.5, so 8.5 is like giving this type of game a 10.

Really like this game!

RATING: 5
A very simple abstract game with luck. While that may not sound too appealing (or original for Knizia), a few things elevate this game above a very crowded field. First, there is a healthy amount of tension as players juggle multiple decisions. Secondly, the component quality is absolutely amazing; the tokens feel quite solid and the token-holders are thick and well-made. And finally, the game is unusually quick to set-up and play. All of this provides a very fluid and engaging experience. This is an absolute gem of a family game and something I suspect many gamers will enjoy as a filler. 

[Update: Rating Lowered From 7 to 5]: After a few plays, there tension and the decisions in this game hinge on a significant luck element. While I still think this is a solid family/filler game, it feels lackluster with serious thought.

RATING: 6
Very light and luck dependent.  Easy to play, it is ok to spend 20 minutes.  A bit of push your luck, a bit of opportunism, but nothing really great here.  As a family game for people not wanting more serious games, it may work fine.

Not Knizia's greatest invention. A simple enough concept but the play feels very straightforward - a simple optimisation of your score on each turn - and rather drien by luck of the draw in terms of the colours that come out of the bag.

RATING: 7
As simple as it is, Rondo is quick to explain and easy to play: nonetheless, it has some strategy as well, which puts it in that middle ground between a bulky filler and a light game where Indigo belongs to as well.

Although they play different, as far as depth and flavour go Rondo and Indigo share a similar place: the former is slightly better though. [i](February 2013)[/i]

[b]Update[/b] - Rondo deserves better than just a 6: hence during my Fall 2015 rating revise I rounded up my rating from 6,5 to 7, the same as Indigo.

RATING: 6
Nice tactical family game that plays quickly.  The draw limit of 5 stones forces more "settle for less" decisions since players generally can't afford to store stones until higher valued places are within reach. Have only played with 2 -- more players would force this matter further.  Players must also decide whether to try to draw more stones to increase a multiplier or lay the stones immediately so as not to lose a space - again, more of an issue with higher player count.

RATING: 6
Players lay tiles onto a board, trying to score victory points.  Players on their turn either draw two tiles from a bag and add them to their rack, or place tiles onto the board and score points.  The board depicts a large wagon wheel, divided into spaces with a number/colour combination - it looks a bit like a Trivial Pursuit layout.  Tiles played must match the colour, may be stacked, and score the victory points per tile placed there.  More tiles can be layed out over multiple spaces, as long as they form a continuous path.  A tile may be played face down on a space, scoring zero points, but forming a bridge to more lucrative positions.  Simple Knizia, rock solid as usual, and feels very nice to play.  There are some nice decisions to make, almost akin to Africa, as you try to spot clever plays that reap a lot of points.

The components are very nice, especially the chunky tiles.  The double sided game board, with two game play options, is a nice addition.

RATING: 5
Rather poor abstract by the Great Doctor.  Not much in the decision-making department going on here.  Lovely components though.  Perhaps good with the family, but his Indigo game from last year is so much better and just as family-friendly, yet offers much more of a 'gaming' feel.   Plays quickly, which is a good thing.

RATING: 7
Not at all bad for a Knizia. (Probably helps that there's NO theme, rather than an irrelevant one.) Spending half your turns drawing tiles is not interesting, but the result-- that you can open things up at a time at a time when your opponents can't do MUCH, but they still might be able to capitalize on your move-- is fun.

RATING: 5
A pleasant way to pass time but nothing too exciting and your choices are limited by turn order and what other players do and the luck of the tile draw. Play is largely reactive to the situation at hand, a little thought at the end game to finish off in your favour.

RATING: 6.5
A strong contender for game of the year 2013; I find at least a nomination likely. The game is super quick to explain, rather fast to play, it offers a certain amount of planning and interaction, tactical decisions (do I block valuable fields for others, how much risk do I take when others have few tokens, etc.), yet has plenty of luck. Ideal family game, despite the uninspired artwork of the board.

Simple tile-laying game. The rules are simple. The game isn't very deep, but makes for a good filler. Components are really nice; reminds me of the nice plastic Ingenious tiles.

A fairly simple game with a decent amount of Strategy which is quite enjoyable to play. Playing Board is reversible with another setup which increases replayability. Game and playing bits attractive which adds to experience. Not Knizia's best but pretty darn good. Trying to play chits onto consecutive coloured spaces to multiply the points there.

Pull tokens out of a bag, place them on the board for points.  If you don't play any tokens on your turn, you draw 2, if you play tokens (up to 5), you draw 1.  Where you place them determines your score.  Light game, with seemingly a lot of luck in the token draw.  After the first play, it seemed like no big deal.  In the second play, it put me in a kingmaker position at the end, so I lowered my rating.

Another mediocre abstract.

Overproduced components make both the box and the price higher than the game deserves.

Underdeveloped graphic design burdens the game with pieces that a wildly bad for the colorblind.

If you want a Knizia abstract, stick to Ingenious.  Skip Rondo.

Rating may improve with further plays - a bit. 

This game seems to be a Keltis wannabe and it doesn't deliver as such; still it isn't bad for what it is. It's a very light filler family game that would fit the Easy Play line of Schmidt - so it's a bit too little for a big box game. Still, can be fun for families, beginners and helps learning some basic tactics, timing and evaluation to children.

I was holding off picking this up as it always seemed too expensive and lightweight. But I found a good deal and decided to give it a whirl. It's surprisingly good. Why? It's incredibly easy to learn, colorful and fun to play, and presents enough decisions to make it worthwhile. You have to watch your opponent very carefully as the hand management process is a signal as to when you should go for or block the high scoring pieces. And you can assess the likelihood of drawing the tiles that you need. Finally, managing the end game requires finesse. Rondo is an original game as well. I can't think of any other games where you are placing colored chips on numbered spaces. It's not as groundbreaking as Ingenious or Keltis but it's got all of the Knizia trademarks. We particularly enjoy this game when we want to play something quick and light, with just enough decisions to keep us engaged. No, it's not deep, but it's a lot of fun and there are enough decisions to make it worthwhile. I've only played with two but I can see that three could work and four has potential as a partnership game. It's also a great game for kids.

A light Knizia tile-placement game. Initially it seems very dependent upon luck, but sometimes the best moves involve playing tiles face down... you don't score points, but neither do opponents. Very well balanced and filled with many decisions. Great production as well, with tiles that are a pleasure to touch. For what it is, very solid and recommended!

One of those; deeper than 1st, 2nd & 3rd plays would suggest, type of games. Big hit with the Wife, even though she's only just beaten me after over a dozen plays. Good lunchtime work game as well. Seconds to teach, seconds per turn, many hours of enjoyment so far. Good looking game, nice board and (plastic) stones. One of the best multiplayer abstracts in the history of my collection. I'm willing to admit that it may get stale one day like any game, but the good times are there!

Jogo muito simples, fácil de aprender e rápido de jogar, embora tenha muito que pensar… Visualmente está muito bem composto, com tabuleiro de duas faces com tonalidades e jogabilidade diferentes, tiles primorosos e até réguas feitas de propósito.

This is a great family game with very simple rules and short playing time appealing to both casual and seasoned gamers among our friends. Nevertheless a true Knizia; the numbers layout of the double board is very clever, and there are some interesting decisions to be made: do you skip your turn to get more coins? Will you accept getting few points only to prevent coin placement of other players? Again, 2012 proves to be a good year for Knizia games!

Fun family game. Way too shallow to appeal to the hardcore set. But can be played competently by kids as young as six, while not boring their parents. That's a great find. If you like Ingenious, you might also enjoy Rondo. I've had good success with Rondo when playing with non-gamers.

A tile laying abstract that might as well have come out in the 1970's. It's got interesting choices here and there but it never made it to fun. A really classic design in a form I just don't appreciate. If this had a digital implementation, I'd probably play it several times a week.

1 play, 4er

A surprisingly fun little game by Herr Doktor Knizia! It's an abstract game with a pretty, double-sided board and great bakelite-type pieces! Easy to teach, quick to play; not something I'd want to play a lot -- I prefer heavier, deeper games -- but it would be a pretty nice little filler.

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
The board shows a few circles, connected by spokes, filled with colored spaces numbered 1-5. A bag has a large number of similarly colored chips (except no gray).

On your turn, you may either draw 2 chips from the bag (max hand size = 5) or play 1+ chips. To play chips, you must play adjacent to a previously played tile or the center space, and play in a continuous string of connected spaces. If the color must matches the space you're covering, score that many points; may play multiple chips on that space (each chip scores VP). If not, play your chip upside down and score no points. 

The game ends at the end of the round (i.e., equal number of turns) when the last gray space is covered OR if a player is unable to draw tiles from the bag. The player with the most VP wins (tiebreaker = number of chips in hand)!

I'm very taken with this new Reiner Knizia game.  Simple, original, interesting to do, not too challenging for kids if they can do multiplication and tell colors apart.  Not a whole lot of crunchy strategical chewiness, but after all the game only lasts 20 minutes.  I love the glowing blue boardgame artwork -- with the surprising shift to glowing red when you flip it over! -- and the substantial, well decorated color tiles.  Excellent artistic presentation gives dignity to the game's simplicity.

Nagyon jól gyakoroltatja a szorzást és igenis kell előre tervezni, mert aki mindig csak egy lépést tervez előre, az veszíteni fog. 

Jól összerakott, szép kis játék. A szabály pofon egyszerű, de azért mégiscsak tervezgetünk térképen és van néhány taktikai lehetőség.

Gyerekekkel ideális talán még 8 év alatt is.

A solid seven, I think! Very pretty board and I love the pieces. A simple to explain and play filler. It seems like you have a lot of choices in how you play your pieces but if you want to maximise your score then actually you haven't.  I think the choices come in terms of whether to pick up or play a piece. It would be interesting to play this several times just to see just how much luck is involved.  The jury is out for me.

i was sure this one was a game just to make some more money but i was happily proved wrong. Rondo is extremely simple but quite interesting, easy but, as usual, with some simple but difficult strategic decisions. The most interesting thing is the extreme balance: playing in two we reached a 122 to 124 points, always with a distance of at most 10 points. very nice filler for all kind of players. unfortunately i hadn't enough space to buy it at essen

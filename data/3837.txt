You really have to calibrate my rating against the following:  In absolute terms, it's a six or so....but as a very nice little game to play with my 4 yo, it's quite good and probably more like a 7.5.

Another grandchildren game but this time one with a tiny bit more bite.  It does exercise your observation and memory and allows for more planning than the others.

Great for littler kids.  Reinforces memory, addition and bluffing, the latter of which my kids are terrible at.  It's short, which can be a plus.  My three year old won twice and came in second the first 4 times we played...

Cada jugador recibe 4 cartas boca abajo, de las cuales solo puede ver 2 de ellas, una sola vez. A lo largo del juego deberá decidir si reemplaza una de sus cartas por la recién robada, tratando de tener el minimo puntaje posible. Cuando cree que no puede tener un puntaje inferior, dice Rat-a-tat-cat y se juega una ronda final.

April 2015: Seems like a good game for kids, but somehow it didn't click with my almost 5 year old son. He played it a few times, but he wouldn't suggest it himself. Now he always says no to it as there are more interesting games for him. Too easy for adults, so I don't reach for it either, but I wouldn't mind playing it with kids.

May 2015: My son has requested to play it on several occasions, mainly because I declined to play longer games when it was too late. We quite enjoyed it, a quick filler for both of us.

June 2015: Collecting dust since May.

A good kids game where players try and get the lowest score possible by swapping out one of four cards in their tableau for ones drawn from a deck.  The rub is that players may or may not actually know the value of the card they are getting rid of.  Elements of Memory and calculated risk taking.

2 plays: Disappointing. The art and game design seem at first well done, but I get the sense gameplay doesn't actually involve many of the most attractive ideas and power plays. The central mechanism is just deeply flawed and the game solidly fails to be what it is trying to be. Still, does introduce the concept of expected value well.

Very light game. Not very much of a theme. Decent art.

You want to maintain a low score. Once another players crosses X number of points the game ends and the player with the lowest total wins. We played to 50. It was entertaining and light hearted. Probably good for kids and killing a bit of time. Easy mechanics.

About 10 plays. Excellent game for adults to play with kids. Probably wouldn't play it with adults.  But the game is remarkable because it seems to reward intelligent and meaningful decisions, with luck and even a risk taking element, while still allowing kids a chance at beating adults (sometimes). I should add that it's fun and doesn't overstay its welcome.  So if I played with kids a lot, for the low price, I'd consider this a must-buy.

Rated for kids.  A huge hit with my daughter who will play it anytime, anywhere.  Another nice portable game that we bring along whenever there will be waiting involved.  Somehow, my 4 1/2 y.o. manages to thump me consistently in this game.
Great moment -- playing this the other night, I drew a 4 and replaced my 9.  My daughter said "So you picked up a 4 or a 5" I asked her why she thought that and she said "I could tell by your face".  She's 4 1/2 yrs. old.  This kid is going to Vegas with me in a few years.  :)

A kid card came where you want the lowest score at the end of the round.  You have four cards in front of you, face down.  Draw the discard or top card from draw deck and replace one of your face down cards.  Once it's down, no peeking.  When you think you have the lowest score say "Rat a Tat Cat".  Everyone totals their scores.

There are a few cards that further mix it up.

Can learn in 5 minutes.  Great for teaching light strategy to 3 to 8-year-olds.  Our 3-year-old plays it and legitimately can win.  

In general, I love Gamewright Games.  $12 for a family game that takes up little space?  Can't beat it.

This is a fun game, especially with kids. The tricky part is when to call last round, as you don't know which cards you have at start and people can "steal" your cards, although they usually don't know what they're stealing, so a good bluff could increase your odds :)

I have purchased a new box each year because we play it so often the cards wear out!  Every family must own this game.  It is so simple and fun.  Our kids have played it from ages 4 and up.  We tried the deluxe version but found the red black out areas too easy to read.  We contacted Gamewright and they immediately sent us a new copy.  The same problem occurred and the company said they are revamping it to solve the issue.  They sent us another copy but my oldest could still see the card through the red x's.  So we decided to go back to the original, which Gamewright provided us for free!  Fantastic customer service and a must have game for families!  We take it everywhere.  I wish I got commission for the amount of copies I have "sold" friends on.

Oh god.  What kind of game hides info from everyone, including yourself?  That's... pointless.  If you want a game where you improve your hand and bluff and knock and stuff, I know an excellent game called 31 with standard cards.  Ask me for the rules.  This game is retarded.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Great children's game. You begin only knowing the vales of 2 of your 4 cards, and draw new cards to substitute. Sometimes the unknown cards you discard are better than the ones you replace them with! 
 
Perhaps a variant to use 2 decks and remove the extreme values; the kiddies only settle for 2's or better and they feel crushed when they up with 9's.

While I recognize that this is a kid's game, even a child will be able to notice what their cards are without the decoder glasses. At least in the GameWright version, you don't need the glasses to decipher what the cards are. The game itself is OK for kids, but it's not a game at all once you recognize the blurred patterns on the cards.

Not a horrible game with the family, but still very luck-based. I reccomend the  following changes. Take out the special action cards prior to dealing the initial hands, then shuffle them back in. Also, give a person a 5 point penalty if the call Rat-a-Tat Cat and they are not the person with the lowest score. With these two tweaks, it becomes a playable game with younger children. Not one for game night though.

This is a very good kids/family game.  One of the best I've played that was actually targeted to kids.  If you're looking to have fun with your kids AND teach them skills they can use later in kicking your butt in adult games, this is a great choice.  It seems to be based on the card game "Golf" which uses a standard deck, but has a few special cards and is better for kids.  This game and "Lily's three for all" make me want to check out other Gamewright games.  "Loot" is supposed to be very good as well.

Somewhat reminiscent of Scat/Ride-the-Bus/31, which is with regular playing cards.

Apparently a commercial version of [gameid=17521] (regular deck - see: [thread=819172][/thread]), but adds cards with special powers.

Best with 3-5.  A lot of luck, very light, but can be fun when played quickly/casually with friends.

A fun little game that falls into the party-game category for me. The game is about deducing what cards you have in front of you and what cards other players have and then trying to get the lowest in front of you.

It is a bit tricky to teach for a party game and rounds can be over very quickly. Not a bad game I just have many other little party-games I would rather play.

Extremely good game for parents with 6 year olds.  Nice mechanism of having two open cards to make it easier for younger kids.  It also is fairly enjoyable to play as an adult - recommended (5/4/10 - rating 8/10). UPDATE: Alas, there is a time when young boys grow up, and this game no longer hits the spot.  Much like a star that burns bright but eventually turns into a white dwarf, these type of kids games eventually end up at a 6 rating. Rating decrease from 8 to 6 (10/10/12) UPDATE 3SF 6.384.

I wish Gamewright would change the illustrations for this game.  They look so childish that it scares off older kids.  My middle school students LOVE playing this game.  I own four copies of the game.  Three of them are for my students because they have a habit of messing up the decks. My husband, friends and I always find this game entertaining.  We always have to convince people new to the game that the game is more fun than it looks, and to not let the illustrations scare them off.

This classic game gets a 10/10 for grade 1&2 children learning addition, but by no means are the choices obvious even for a seasoned mathematical puzzler.  Do not be off-put by the simplicity of the cards or instructions.  The game has hidden information which makes it thoroughly difficult to analyze.  If you love Liars Dice (Perudo) & Lost Cities, you'll love Rat-a-Tat Cat.

Our family LOVES this game.  It's one of the few games that everyone (11, 10, and 5 year boys and 2 gamer parents) CAN and WANTS TO play.  It plays quickly and has an educational component that helps the young ones (4-6 year olds).  Basically, when you add up your 4 cards, you want the lowest score (low cards are cats, high cards are rats).  The hitch is that the cards are dealt to you faced down in a row and you may peek at only the outer cards at game start. There are opportunities to swap out cards and steal other people's low cards, but you have to remember what cards you have and their position as well as what the other players have.  Having a good memory is essential, which basically means the kids beat me all the time.  I like the game so much that I gift it as a birthday present for 5 - 6 year olds whenever possible.

So far my most consistent gaming partner is my 5-y-o son.  He really likes this game -- and he's GOOD at it!  After 1 or 2 plays he clearly had a grasp of the rules and (with a TINY bit of help) he was working on strategy.  And (bonus for me) it's fun to play!

RATING: 6
Simple card game where each player has 4 cards face down. During play the aim is to minimise the total value of your hand, by replacing them with cards of lower value. There are also special cards that let you peek at one of your cards, or swap one with another player. Game ends when one player is ready to call. Could easily be played with a standard deck of cards.

It's a derivative of the classic card game Golf and an improvement in that it adds more options and perhaps excitement (if you can call it that) with the 3 special cards. Players are trying to get the lowest score.  I'm not a big fan but if you want to play a longer adult-size version I would recommend you try Play Nine.

Really pretty decent. Doesn't rely on slapping or any other garbage like that. The memory element is not something I normally dig, but it is well-done here, forces me to pay attention, and for my son, who's five, it came at just the right time. It's still a little tough for him not to peek at his cards when he's not allowed to, but I like the learning process there. And, it has just enough bluffing to get my wife excited. Which is fortunate, since she's terrible at it.

Card game where you place down four cards and at some point someone calls rat a tat cat and you add up the points.  You want the least amount of points.

Some special cards allow you to peek and swap out cards with other players. There is a memory component.

Rating is for playing with kids.

A great game to play with kids as the rules and the strategy are both fairly simple.  My daughter isn't quite five and she can handle it.  There is quite a bit of luck, but there is strategy.  Which makes it fun for all- the adults aren't bored out of their minds, but the kid stands a fighting chance even if the adults make the more logical choices.  I'd say the optimal ages for this one are 4-8 or so, but it actually makes a tolerable, if not great, filler for adults.

My rating reflects fond memories: this was a game that my very young daughter (not ordinarily a gaming fan) utterly adored, and which was fun enough for adults to play too. Quite scalable in difficulty, too--you could gradually keep more cards hidden and kids could learn how to memorize them. Avoid the later anniversary edition with the "superpeek" powers.

Nowadays I'd probably move kids on to Sushi Go once they had this down but it's still a good way to get them into card games.

Players have 4 face down cards, and the object of the game is to have the lowest sum total. Each turn you can replace a card, or there are special cards that let you look at your own card or swap.

This rating is based on my five year old daughter's enjoyment of it. There is a memory element and basic addition which teaches some math. It's fun for a young age group, but honestly, not great gaming experience for say 9 years and up. We'll see how long the enjoyment factor stays.

The artwork on the box and cards makes this look like a little kids' card game; however, it's a fun, clever game that plays quickly, by rounds. It requires memory skills, which gives young kids a leg-up, but each round comes down to who can go out first and, hopefully, score the lowest point total. I'm wondering what the ideal number of players is for this: Opinions seem to vary. The fewer players, the lower the winning score should be. At the time my 10-year-old son and I played, we pretty much settled on 60 for a 2-player total that plays quickly enough but gives one a chance to come from behind. We also played to 75 at times. Played this with my gamer sister in July 2013 and she rated it a "10". Really an outstanding, engaging game.

Our 5 year old has enjoyed this, but there's not much there. Pull cards that are smaller than your 4 tabled cards, or pull a high card and pass on it.

I've played the German version "Biberbande" which has some great-artwork beavers.
The idea is simple: you have four cards, two of which you know. Then you draw a card either from discard or draw pile and either execute it or discard it. One of the best things in this game is the possibility to end the game on any turn.
And as I said, the artwork is fantastic (in Biberbande).

Short and fun!

RATING: 5
Kids' memory game with gimmicky viewer, this is fine for what it is at higher player counts (lower, it's too easy to know you're ahead). Grown-ups can be disadvantaged by not being allowed to look at their two outer cards (out of four face down), but there's a big chunk'o'luck-factor in the cards that get turned over, so don't invest too heavily in the game and it will at least meet expectations. Unfortunately, the marks on the backs of the cards can be interpreted fairly easily even without the viewer, due to the length of the print: it's simple to tell a SWAP or PEEK card (four characters) from an 8 EIGHT 8 or 3 THREE 3 card (seven characters).

I don't see people talking about the serious lack of Peek cards in this game - without more ways to see what cards you have, the game seems to go too long or be a blind-gamble game. We'll play where Draw 2 and Peek both have both abilities and see if that fixes the information problem in this game.
edit -  yes, the game works better with Draw 2's being able to Peek as well. In fact, now I think Peek should be a Draw 2 option, also. Leave Swap alone.
It seems to work better with the outer cards face-up (since it requires less Peek cards to finish a round, making them quicker), but I will continue playtesting.

Non c'è altro gioco a cui abbia giocato di più. Divertente gioco di carte per tutte le età! Regole semplici per un gioco rapido. Questo gioco è diventato un successo immediato in quanto è molto divertente per qualsiasi tipo di giocatori. Un gioco di carte di memoria breve con alcune decisioni tattiche interessanti da effettuare e con un certo grado di "cattiveria" quando si utilizza la carta "SWAP". La durata della partita lo rende un grande gioco da giocare con i bambini, che non sanno gestire bene il "Saper Perdere", in quanto in breve tempo si mescolano le carte e si gioca di nuovo, così da insegnare il concetto di provare a giocare meglio e se non si vince si riprova. Inoltre è anche un bene per insegnare ai bambini di non mostrare le loro emozioni quando si prendono le carte. Non annoia gli adulti. I disegni sono molto simpatici. In nessuna collezione può mancare questo piccolo capolavoro!

RATING: 9
My students 6 through 10 years old love this game. Its best when you play with 3 to 6 players. It's a fun get-together game I dont see so much memory skills involved since you need to retain only 4 pieces of information but definitely teach and improve basic addition skills. I dont see how you can play with a 4 years old or younger since changing the cards without looking could be upsetting for them. The game improves the observation and promotes the importance of timing. The best part of the game you can analyze different characteristic by watching the players and the way they are playing. İts a great game for families, adults and kids playing together. And the game is also good for teaching the kids of not showing their emotions when the cards are picked.

RATING: 6.5
Picked this one up for my son who enjoys quicker games and loves cats.  It has been a success.

Each player is dealt 4 cards but only looks at 2 of them (the ones on the end of a line up of four).  The goal is to have the lowest score when someone declares "Rat-a-tat cat", so if you note high cards in these spots you want to replace them as soon as possible.

Each turn one player may either take the top card of the discard pile and replace one of their four with it, or may draw the top card off the draw deck and either replace a card in their line up or discard it.  There are "power cards" as well that let you "peek" at one of your face down cards, draw extra cards to try and get a good card value, or swap a card in your lineup with another players.

The game is quick (you can play a set number of rounds, or agree to a set number of points where a player is eliminated).  

The good:
    -nice lighthearted theme for children
    -quick playtime, mostly simple rules
    -kids have a chance at winning due to high luck
     factor
    -low cost of game

The bad:
    -high luck factor :).  Seriously, there are many
     games where I never have the opportunity to look at
     my two middle cards, which makes it a guess when to 
     end the round.
    -cards could be a little more durable.  They aren't
     bad, but they feel as if they won't stand the test
     of time if the game is played often.
    
Bottom line : a nice game for kids, especially if they like cats.

Update : I am still playing this game, now with my young daughter.  The cards *have* stood the test of time, so I should have given more credit to them than I did.  A good game to play with your young children.

I need to play this a few more times to get a better feel for what's going on - it seemed a little too random when we played it.  I think it would be more engaging with an older opponent too.  We'll be playing it some more and I'm sure my rating will move accordingly.

Plenty of fun for a kids game. One issue is that while the code on the back of the card is illegible without the special "super peak" glasses, one can rule out certain cards based on the length of the "coded" script. Younger kids won't likely pick this up.

Nice game to play with kids.  Plays quickly per round, so an easy filler - play enough rounds to fill the time.

Modest memory element but not overwhelming.  Plays a bit differently depending on the number of players.  With 2, easier to get the lower cards.  With more, need to consider just how low is good enough.

RATING: 4
rated as a kid's game

This is a kid's version of a game I use to play with a standard deck (under the name SCAT, but not the game that's normally called SCAT).  I liked it a bit less that the original, although I see the appeal of the invisible ink and special power gimmicks.

Rat-a-tat-cat is pretty random, and when you fall behind it can be obvious that you will never catch up, which is not good for a kid's game.  The initial deal of 4 cards has about as much to do with who wins as all the rest of the game put together.  Most of the time, the winning player never made any tough choices, since they just draw low cards and keep them.  The hard choices are all made by players who lose, bu drawing mid-cards.  Some players will invariably draw nothing but high cards, then do the obvious thing of not keeping the cards, which is boring and you end up losing.

Also, there is a cute gimmick of using a red transparent sheet to see 'invisible' writing on the back of each card.  However, once you know to look for it, you can figure it out by looking carefully, and do not need the red sheet.  You spend so much time staring at your own card backs that it becomes hard NOT to cheat.  The game still functions, and the gimmick is a hit with kids, but I found it a bit disappointing.

for kids: 4/10
for adults: 2/10

Enjoying this a little more as my 5yo learns to be crafty. It's fun to watch her face when she takes a card - she knows I'm watching her and has started to bluff, very subtly - placing a 9 down with just a hint of confidence that suckers me in 75% of the time.

This game is a lot more fun than I ever really imagined it could be.  Playing with the younger player rules made it fun for the girls, who were able to win quite handily.  However, playing with the regular rules made it a challenge when playing with my wife.  It is amazing just how many games we ran through the first time we tried it out.  Lots of fun for us!

Biberbande -- 

Played once; four-player.

I'd seen lots of comments calling this a children's game, so I was concerned that this might be too simplistic for my own enjoyment.  As it turned out, it [i]is[/i] simplistic, but pleasantly so.  Because it can play quickly, it functions well as a light filler.

Glad John Broky pointed it out, as the Biberbande artwork is quite fun (and far superior to the Rat-a-Tat Cat artwork).

I may not be likely to suggest [thing=3837]Biberbande[/thing], but I'm very likely to agree to it when someone else makes the suggestion.

EDIT - I've played this before I started enjoying kids games and casual games. Have to re-evaluate. 

Gameswright version - stylish illustrations that look more like a good children's book than what kids games usually look like (big plus)

I like it: simple but challenging enough. 
Some guessing work, some memorisation aspect. 
Perfect kids game it seems. Rating is for adults - for kids it's around 8 (but I don't have kids yet).

I always have a hard time rating kids games, but as I enjoy a number of them, I feel fair in saying that this game sucks.  

Sure, kids will like it, but there is absolutely nothing here for adults.  You may say this is unfair, but I think that Barney sucks too, and kids loved that crap as well.  

Not to mention that this is just the craptastic old game Golf (which makes this boring and derivative).

No control, 100% luck.

Great kid's game -- fast, fun for adults, involves memory, a bit of math, bluffing, and some strategy.  

I was torn re how to rate this one.  It's not as interesting a game as any of my 8s and I'd never play it without a kid, but it's literally true that I'll never turn down a game because it's too quick and never boring.  Lately, we've been playing Corsari rather than Rat-a-Tat Cat -- unless there are little kids around.  My guess is that kids outgrow this one around 2nd grade, but it's a great choice for ages 4-7.

An outstanding game for kids. A short memory card game with some interesting tactical decisions to be made. Players are even forced to apply some basic probability principles ("is the '3' I just drew probably lower than that middle card in my set?"). There's even a degree -- a small degree to be sure -- of 'nastiness' to this game when the Swap card is used. But this nastiness is so light, and the game so short, that kids won't mind. The length of time it takes to finish also makes it a great game to play with kids who don't handle losing well. It's generally over in less than 15 minutes so when a young one loses you just shrug your shoulders, shuffle the cards, and deal 'em again. It just reinforces the idea that you play your best and if you don't win you try again. (Note on Rating: I rate children's games based on how fun and enriching the game is for kids -- not adults.)

(Beaver Gang: ) Perfect filler for gamers, non-gamers, adults and children alike. Scales well between 2 en 6 players, but probably best with 3 - 4. Gets better as players get more experienced, with even more bluffing, guessing and double-guessing going on. One round takes very, very little time to play. This game took me completely by surprise, but I still need to be in the mood to play a very random game like this.

I bought this game at the start of the Christmas vacations of 2007 (or perhaps 2006?).  I was not expecting much, but it was a tremendous hit with my nephews, which is the reason why I no longer own it.  They liked it so much that I just had to leave it with them.  One year later, it warmed my heart to find the deck of cards all worn out!  (BTW, we played with a "house rule": we used the peek cards as swap cards.)

Compré este juego durante el comienzo de las vacaciones de 2007 (o tal vez las del 2006).  No tenía grandes esperanzas en el juego, pero resultor ser todo un éxito con mis sobrinos, que es la razón por la cual ahora no me pertenece.  Les gusto tanto el juego que simplemente tuve que dejárselos.  Un año después, ¡se me alegró el corazón al encontrar el mazo de cartas muy desgastado por el uso!  (Por cireto, nosotros jugamos con una regla casera: utilizamos las cartas "peek" cual si fueran "swap".

Get rid of the rats and go for the cats! In Rat-a-Tat Cat, less is always better, and you want to go out with the lowest score. Can you remember the numbers on the other players' cards? Can you keep a poker face, but notice when another player looks pleased? Sharpen your memory and your timing, and have fun with the cool cats and bad rats of Rat-a-Tat Cat.

I wish I had kids to play this with. Feels like a more complex and fun game could have been made, but current version feels too simple to keep me interested.

RATING: 2
Desperately needs to have a penalty for calling Ratatatcat and failing to have the lowest hand. Too much luck, and the wrong sort, so kids won't have a chance against adults. But the biggest annoyance is that every hand is over way too quickly if everyone's on the ball, so you're constantly shuffling. Hmm...I sense a conspiracy here: shuffle, shuffle, the cards wear out, and what's the next step?

A simple card game that I've enjoyed immensely since childhood. Everyone I've introduced the game to has loved the simplicity and quick gameplay. Great for all ages.

RATING: 5
This is a very simple game. You have 4 cards to start the game and you know the value of two of them. Replacing one card at a time the goal is to have the lowest score of all of the players. When one player thinks they have the lowest score they announce the last turn for the other players.

Gets played a lot because it plays quick and travels easily.  We vary the cards in possession and play high ball, too

Great game for teaching kids deduction, memory, and elimination. It's not one of those games that is boring for adults. It's actually fun for adults as well.

Very easy to play children's card game.  It is a game of memory, matching, some guessing, and a lot of luck.  Good for small children, if they know their numbers.

This is a great game for families with younger children. There is no reading involved, and the memory aspect will help develop the kid's minds. Could have been a bit better game with more swaps and peeks, but still, a very quick, fun game.

Rated for children.  Young kids enjoy this while learning the concept of lowest values.  2008: My 9 yo daughter still likes to play.

RATING: 4.5
Very strange game. Pretty sure that it is broken if played seriously by adults, but against kids it works. Rating assumes playing against kids. There are other games I prefer, though.

Update: Something about this game (maybe its brokenness? It's use of memory as a main mechanic?) bothers me so I'm dropping the rating a bit. I still play when Ella asks, and she likes it a lot.

Update 2: I like this game less every time I play it. I dread my daughters asking me about it, although they enjoy it. Dropping the rating again.

Fun, quick game. Lots of luck & memory, which means my kid wins a lot! 
We play it regularly because we never have to look at the rules.

I hope to learn this one to play with the 4th-6th grade group that I run though it may be a little too young for them.  I might wait for my nephews and neices to get older.

Both of my daughters have loved this game, at the age of about 7 years old. It is a great game for learning basic addition, and its memory mechanism is implemented in a fun way.

However, the game isn't all that exciting. It can come down to what card's flipped face up at the start of the game by the dealer just handing that round to the first player. What I'm saying is that while this may be okay for kids, and certain families, it's far from interesting to gamers.

Cada jugador recibe 4 cartas boca abajo, de las cuales solo puede ver 2 de ellas, una sola vez. Deberá decidir si reemplaza una de sus cartas por la recién robada, tratando de tener el minimo puntaje posible. Cuando cree que no puede tener un puntaje inferior, dice Rat-a-tat-cat y se juega una ronda final.

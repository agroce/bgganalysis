RATING: 7
An instant hit with my family. It's a light, fun filler where you press your luck while remembering where your card values are in your four face down cards. You call Cabo when you think you are lower than everyone else. In my experience, this is when they all gang up on you and swap cards if they draw a swap.

2010. 2-5p. 30 min. filler game of memory and some bluffing. My friends like it. I still need to try it.

BGGer/TBGTer Matt Wolfe says: Great filler game. Nice bluffing elements to the game, strong memory required. If you don't like memory games, you won't like Cabo.

RATING: 10
Fantastic game that mixes elements of many other popular card games into something new and unique. We have logged probably hundreds of two-player hands and it also plays well (and is very different) with larger groups. Recommend combining 2 decks for any more than 4 players.

Has elements of take-that and memory with a lot of luck. But it's still a solid filler game with interesting card art. Must play with a penalty for revealing non-matching pairs.

Good little filler game. Fun to try and guess your way through what you, and everyone else at the table, has. Highly, highly luck dependent though, which drags it down a bit for me. I'll always be up for a quick game of Cabo.

RATING: 4
Fun, light game that plays very fast.  Playing to 100 can be a bit long, but there are some fun elements that come into play at the 50 mark and near the end of the game.  People with better memories will likely do better but there are also ways you can push your luck to try and come out on top.

Cute card game of memory where everyone wokrs to get the lowest four cards. Fun, but the cards are garish to look at.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Deduction, memory, press your luck game as you start by only knowing half your cards. You start with 4 face down. During your turn it's either take from face up pile and replace a card or draw from face down deck and use special power or just replace a face down card. The press your luck part is whoever calls "Cabo" (thinks they have the lowest card total on the board) does nothing but risk other players messing up their cards for the last turn. Liked the art work of Unicorn puking a rainbow :)

Cabo is an extremely simple card game of memory, probability, and psychology. I like it.

I learned this and Love Letter in the same evening. The two are very similar in many ways, and I much preferred the lesser-known Cabo.

RATING: 3
Primarily a memory game, Cabo has players take four cards and place them face-down. Each turn, a new card is drawn which can replace one of these cards or be discarded. It can even replace several of the facedown cards if those cards are the same. Occasionally, a card will allow you to swap with someone else or peek at a card. The point of all this replacing and peeking is to get to the point where you feel you have the lowest total of cards in front of you. At this point, you call "Cabo" and everyone else gets one more turn.

Successfully calling has no benefit (the player with the lowest total always scores zero regardless of who called), but failing at this call gives a penalty. Even with only four players, calling is almost never a good idea which makes the game almost interminable and largely chance-based. 

Blitz is a much better version of this type of game and can be played with a standard deck of cards. The pretty pictures on here are reminiscent of the surrealistic illustrations in Dixit, but the substance is severely lacking. Possibly okay with kids, but you could do better even with them.

Great game!
You should like memory though. There is a little bluffing, luck & panache to it..! :)
(e.g. if you call cabo in the first round)

RATING: 7
You need a good memory and a sharp eye which cards are swapped where but there are some tactics involved when knowing when to call and scope for a bit of bluffing.

Slightly similar to Khmer, without the total control about one's own cards. Entertaining enough, I like it. Ugly, though. 
Edit: I'm withdrawing my rating here - I hadn't known it was more or less a copy of an existing game - is that the reason no designers are named? Unless I hear about the background of that, I don't feel uncomfortable to push it up in the rankings (although I do like the game).

Cabo is one of the most bizarre card games I have played. The artwork on the cards is beautiful which is a little shame as you play the game picture side down and you never get to see the pictures.
It's a very simple game that takes some memory and skill to win.

Only thing I would change is a rule where a player gets 0 points only if they shout "Cabo". It seems a little unfair that you can get 0 when you don't even know if you are winning or not. (But that is a variation rule you can it play with.)

RATING: 8
An excellent filler game and advantage goes to people who have great memories or able to track cards well.  Regardless, I don't have that memory skill and it is a lot of fun to try a few different things by (1) trying to make matches & cut down on your cards or (2) minimize your score or (3) screw the leader by swapping his cards.  I'm sure you could bluff as well but I'm not experienced enough to attempt that just yet.

A very good light card game. Reminiscent of Hearts but with a Memory twist. Easy to teach to non-gamers and a perfect choice for people accustomed to playing standard card games.  We also successfully played it with our 5-year old daughter multiple times and she picked up on it quickly.

I would never turn down a game of Cabo.

I like this game. I play a lot with people who don't like getting into games, especially into the more complicated ones. Cabo rules are told in minutes and it's a really good filler. Although we've played it for 3 or 4 hours straight because after the first round people start realizing the mechanics of the game.

It's Rat-a-Tat-Cat revisited, rule for rule, same cards. Except they've added that you can trade in a pair or triple for a blind card, and you can shoot the moon with high cards, which marginally improves it. But doesn't save the game from being a complete luck-fest with no interesting decisions, as well as being a memory game which is the most detested form of "fun" in a game. My kids didn't even like the original and it was pitched at their level.

I haven't actually bought a deck of these cards, but I learned to play, and promptly scribbled the instructions "Peek" "Spy" and "Swap" on some standard deck of playing cards.

This is a lovely game, I think best played with 3 players.  With 5 or more people you can't really even try to know what other players have so it's basically a series of hopes and plain luck.  2 players is good, but 3 mixes it up a little.  Good fFun!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Another light and simple game that I quite enjoy which is unusual for me.

The game is very simple, you have 4 face down cards in front of each player and at the start of the game each player can look at 2 of them.  Then each turn you draw a card and either switch it with one of your 4, discard it, or use one of the 3 abilities that are on some cards (peek at one of your cards, spy on an opponents, or swap).  You can also switch pairs of 3- or 4-of-a-kinds with drawn cards instead of 1-for-1.

The goal is to have the lowest number set of all players.  When you believe you do you call "Cabo" and each other player gets one more turn to mess with you.  At the end of a round whoever has the lowest gets 0 points and the rest get their total, the winner is determined by whoever has the lowest total when someone gets to a certain point total.  Also, calling "Cabo" and not finishing with the lowest total comes with a 5-point penalty.

The game plays quick, is simple, and most importantly, fun.  And for a small, presumably cheap, game I think I'll be getting a copy soon.

High fun interaction and about a 7% memory element make this basically kind of clunky simple card game into an excellent social game.  Even if you CAN remember exactly all four numbers you have facedown, there's such an abundance of luck and rapid swings of fortune that it's no guarantee you'll win the hand.  So dive in and laugh it up!

This game is more fun than I thought it would be.  It's a great little memory game that's easy to pick up and play when you've just got a few minutes or so.  We never have played to 200 points.  I think more than 2 players would be tough to handle, but two players' cards is just enough to try to keep in mind.

Supposedly based on a public domain game, Cabo is essentially a [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/3837/rat-a-tat-cat]Rat-a-Tat Cat[/url] rip-off.  Or they're both ripping off each other.  I don't care.

One major annoyance: If you're dealt two extremely low cards, why not go out immediately?  Isn't that a reasonable play?

I'm now obligated to lower my Rat-a-Tat Cat rating given how little I enjoyed this game.

Fun game, where it is the goal to remember which card is at which place. Will become more difficult when playing with more 3 or 4 and might even become hectic when playing with 5. The artwork on the cards, is of a kind which you will or won’t like. The artwork is not my cup of tea, but I like the game. It’s a real challenge to remember where all the cards are at the table.

This is basically the same game as Biberbande, or RAT-A-TAT-CAT. Cards have slightly different numbers and the rules are almost identical except the 'get rid of a pair' rule.

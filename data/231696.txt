This is actually surprisingly good considering that it is a Target exclusive game.  It is a mix between two very solid games.  Ticket to Ride (because of the set collecting) and Takenoko (because of the action die you roll at the start of your turn.)  It is honestly a great "gateway" family game.  I can see this potentially getting non-gamers to be like "Huh.  What other games are like this."  I would have rated it one star higher but I do not think it will be in heavy rotation or anything in my game group.  Regardless, fun little game about happy little trees.  Enjoy!

This really *shouldn't* work... but it does. The whole concept is really nicely put together. The game itself is simple and east to learn. After a few false starts we finally got it right and enjoyed it very much.
I've only played 2 players so far, but we really enjoyed ourselves! Despite the overall goal of trying to get "chill" points, we were seriously trying to out-paint each other! It was lots of fun!
You can't go wrong dropping a few bucks on this light-hearted game that still has enough strategy and planning to keep it interesting. I think it's a good one for non-gamers who show up at game night... and also a nice one for gamers who want something lighter to end a long evening.
I, for one, am really glad that someone (Prospero Hall) had the crazy idea to make this game and that Big G Creative had the chutzpah to actually publish it. It's a winner.

Just boring. The theme does absolutely nothing for me, and the die resolution and event cards just introduce way too much added randomness into what is already an extremely light, random game.

This is a very good family-weight set collection game. If you're interested in that category of games,  this is worth checking out ... especially if you like Bob Ross. But even if you don't, I strongly recommend this game for any group that enjoys Ticket to Ride. There's no map component to this game, so it's not as aggressive as TTR can be, but there will be a huge overlap in fans of the two games. It's basically a more "chill" version of the same concept, while still retaining a satisfying level of competition.

RATING: 7
Fun, light game that would work perfectly as an introduction to modern board games for non-gamers. Players take turns collecting paint and brushes to complete various elements of Bob Ross' paintings like fluffy clouds and happy little trees. The theme is obviously the big draw here and I'm happy to report that it is very-well integrated into the game instead of being pasted on. Definitely not a heavy game, but perfect for fans of Bob Ross or families looking for a quick and simple game to play together!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A simple structure of a game that works well.

I however found Bob Ross's picture and/or signature on everything to be a big creepy in the end.  Rolling the die to start every turn ended up with comments of various types on the moving of the Bob (or not).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This set collection game reminds me of "Ticket to Ride." Like that game, you'll be drawing cards from a deck most turns in order to gain the colors you'll need to paint various elements. The strategy is light, making it appropriate for newcomers, if a bit basic for serious gamers. The presentation, however, is quite excellent, with Bob Ross pictures being displayed upon an easel, and each player's game board an art palette. This is certainly a game that looks nice on the table, which again makes it ideal for newcomers.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
There's a decent amount of game in here, actually.  Sure, there's a lot of randomness too, but you do have to make some decisions about what aspects to commit to.  There's a little push-your-luck with the Bob track, and you can also decide to paint quickly for small points or save up for more points.  Still though, it's nothing amazing - you're not playing this because it's a great game.  It's an absurd theme on top of a pretty formulaic set collection game.  However, I wouldn't turn down a play as it made for a fun evening.

RATING: 8
Surprised at how enjoyable this is. Although just $20 at Target -- the components certainly reflect that price -- this mix of various tried-and-true mechanics (set collection, variable rules, timer track, etc) really come together under the silly theme of Bob Ross and his  paintings and it all just works.

A much better game than I thought it was going to be when I opened it. Players are trying to collect sets of cards to match the paint colors and brushes required to add a feature to the landscape print. At the same time players are racing Bob to complete features before he does to earn bonus points. If any player or Bob finishes a painting, a new scene is pulled out and play starts over with the new goals. For non-gamers it can take a little getting used to the dual purpose cards - they can be brushes or paint colors. The game provides enough ways to manipulate the cards so while a draw is random, you can use those cards to build up scoring bonuses for future rounds. With rule explanation and three players, it takes only 30-40 minutes. Enough challenges and things to try in order make it an interesting weeknight game.

Much better than I expected.   It has some basic set collection, in a way that is similar to Ticket To Ride, although cards have both colors and brushes on them and you can use either.   The incentive to gain a Technique mastery, along with beating Bob on certain features gives the game a little push without being too nasty.  The presentation is good and it really evokes Bob Ross in a way that feels like a genuine tribute.

So far we like the easy-medium to learn and play race to score so many points. Thematic on many levels but I don't think Bob Ross would make a competition out of completing paintings. Regardless, the game is fun and does promote the joy of painting. After 2nd play: the paint technique cards may be overpowered if one spends the beginning of the game acquiring these; more plays needed to determine if a variant is needed.

My husband and I enjoy playing "Bob Ross: Art of Chill Game." Neither of us had heard of Bob Ross before we saw this game in the store. A few YouTube views later, we became confirmed fans of his peaceful, laid-back presentation and the magic of the scene coming to life under his brush. What a fun theme for a game! The mechanisms of the game are a good fit with the theme, and the gameplay is low-key but interesting. The components are a nice quality and reflect Bob's work perfectly. We are glad to have this game in our collection.

RATING: 7
This is a decent game that reminds me a lot of Ticket to Ride, but less competitive and tad less strategic. It is what it says it is- chill. It was a little challenging for my color-blind having the colors written on the painting   easel would have been a nice idea, but tat is not there. Colors are typed on the cards though. For a game of this type, I’d say is pleasantly surprisingly. For me as a game, it’s okay, but definitely a little too simple for my tastes. I’ll play this when I’m in the mood for the theme (which it matches very well) but probably will not play it that often.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's Ticket to Ride but faster and less luck dependent (I think? The die is pretty terrible), so better. And I have a personal attachment to the theme since I used to love watching the Joy of Painting. But that said it's still too luck dependent and decision light for my taste. I can see enjoying it every now and again, but it's definitely not my kind of game. Probably ideal for TTR lovers who are also Joy of Painting fans though.

RATING: 6
Full disclosure: this was my white elephant gift at work. I did a quick peek on BGG and decided to steal it from another participant and it is now a decorative element in my office. Played it after the holidays with my co-workers' after work game night and it was surprisingly okay! That may sound like damning with faint praise, and it is. It's not a great game, but it is a creative implementation of the theme.

Players are drafting cards, a la Ticket to Ride, each of which features a color and a type of brush. Players play groupings of colors before them on a palette in order to assemble the required set to complete a feature on a shared painting. Players play the required colors from their palette and the required brush from their hand, as designated on the feature (ie, "Happy Little Trees"). Players completing a set earlier than the others get a bonus and if you complete some feature before Bob does, you'll get additional bonuses. Wait...before Bob? Yes, players are racing the painting master to complete features and potentially the entire painting before he does! At the start of every turn a player rolls a die. With every roll, there is a 50% chance that Bob will advance on the Bob track, coming closer to finishing features and the overall painting. Once a player or Bob completes all three features, the painting is done and a new painting is randomly selected, requiring different features and different sets. In a game 5-6 paintings might get finished. Other cards can give a bonus for each time you use specific paints and brushes. First to the end of the score track achieves "chill" and wins the game. This is a light game that party gamers may play for the "chill" theme. Don't get this for your game group, get it for those who think you are crazy for even having a game group.

[microbadge=26524]

Set collection, except the sets change with each painting that Bob starts.  Cute theme, but the connect between theme and mechanics is a bit of a stretch.  I grew up watching [i]The Joy of Painting[/i], so it was odd seeing board game mechanics and things like "chill" being thrown around with Bob Ross.  Regardless, not a bad game, but a game that still relies on an ethos gimmick.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's [thing=9209][/thing] minus the map element. Collect sets of paint colors and brushes (both a color and a brush per card, choose which side) to complete famous elements of Bob Ross' paintings (Majestic Mountains, Wondrous Water, and of course Happy Little Trees). Earn bonus points for painting a feature before the other players and/or Bob, who paints along with you as the game's timer. A typical game uses two or three of Bob's paintings (roughly 30 are provided).

The game is not particularly deep, but is clean and functional and has a wonderful table presence with the large-format painting sitting vertically on an easel.

I suggest dropping the point bonus for gaining a technique from 2 Chill to 1. Two cards for two points is already an impressive exchange rate, and the technique is likely to earn at least one additional point later in the game.

One [b]big[/b] bonus over TtR: Ross' deck is nearly self-shuffling. Rather than playing a set of five Reds, you play a spread of colors. Reshuffling an empty deck thus takes much less work to get back to a reasonable distribution.

A great, quick, light family game.  At 30 minutes, with some easy-to-learn rules and mechanics, hand management instead of just hording cards until end-game, and the tension of racing against other players to complete objectives, this is what Ticket to Ride should've been.  Plus all the Bob Ross voices at the table had us laughing so hard we were crying.

I will ALWAYS play this game.  I've played it 2, 3 and 4 player, and it's different every time.  I've played with some hard-hitting strategy players, and didn't expect them to like it (they were just humoring me the first time), and they LOVED it!  Not only did it have more strategy than they expected, and they were busily undercutting each other and trying out different strategies for gathering points (such as avoiding area completion and going for techniques, instead - one guy stacked up like 10 techniques and would get anywhere from 4 - 8 extra points whenever he did complete something), but every time we rolled Bob, everyone yelled, "Bob!" and some people threw their arms in the air, making the game a total riot.  (Oh - and if you have someone who can manage to read the flavor text in Bob's voice, so much the better!  We laughed, and laughed!)

RATING: 8
I've been a fan of The Joy of Painting ever since I was 3 or 4 years old, and I'm happy to say that the Art of Chill, while not being that great of a name, is a really solid design. It borrows pretty heavily from Ticket to Ride and recipe fulfillment Euros, but I like how it comes together. Some of the components are really top notch, and I like that so many of Bob Ross' paintings were included as art. The only real knock I have against the game is with the technique cards, which you almost have to go after to stay in contention. I think a good house rule would be to remove a certain amount with 2 and 3 players. Otherwise these can potentially make up at least half the points you need to win. Overall though, this was a surprise hit for me, despite being linked to a very unusual license, even though it's one I enjoy. If you like games like Splendor, and the theme of painting interests you, I'd recommend checking this one out.

A 2-4 player set-collection game which basically plays like a re-themed "Ticket to Ride".

[b]Bob Ross: Art of Chill[/b]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (10):[/COLOR]

[i]This was an amazing birthday gift from my wife, along with tickets to go see Postmodern Jukebox (youtube them if you haven't heard of them). My birthday is at the end of December so I only managed to get a few plays in, but that is all it took for this game to become an instant classic. This choice is definitely due in part to nostalgia. I watched a lot of The Joy of Painting with Bob Ross, he and Julia Child were two of my heroes growing up. What is amazing is that the designer, Prospero Hall, managed to create a really good game that ties in perfectly with the theme [i](if you have played Ticket to Ride, you'll have a good idea of how this will play)[/i]. The best part of the game are the various quotes from Bob that are on all the chill cards. The production is top notch as well, the included easel is an awesome way to display the paintings. I am really surprised at how good the game actually is, Bob Ross: The Art of Chill is a great gateway/family game that I would recommend everyone experience at least once.

[i]I actually played this at the end of 2017, but somehow forgot to add it to my December new to me geeklist. Bob Ross: The Art of Chill also made it onto my Top 10 New to Me games I played in 2017.[/i][/i]

RATING: 8
This is a very good game! It would also be excellent for a gateway game. 

Experienced gamers enjoy this too. Possibly more as a filler game, as it only lasts about 30 minutes, 40 max. 

The game gives you interesting decisions to make: 

-Do I go heavy for Technique cards? These give you small points immediately, but more points during the game when painting. But while you accumulate these, others are probably finishing parts of the painting.

-Do I try to race Bob to paint items before he does? This can get you bonuses.

-Can I get all three sections completed (this takes away the current painting and brings in a new one) and hose the other players with loaded palettes? Or will I actually end up hosing myself doing this?

Figuring out who is competing with you and in what areas is key.

The components and artwork are just excellent.

I've taught to 5 other people and two of those have already picked it up.

Bought this after watching one video from Zee Garcia and discovered Target carries it. Played one solo game to learn the mechanics, and it is simple, straight forward and pleasant. Even if no one else ever plays this with me, this can be a zen game for the end of a long day. No great innovation in terms of game design or mechanics, but the inclusion of Bob's artwork will make any fan of his old PBS show calm and "chill." Ok, the name of the game is pretty hokey. I'm not sure what I would propose as an alternative, but Bob had so many great catch phrases, any one of those would have worked better. How about "Bob Ross' Happy Painting Game"?

A game I bought purely on nostalgia.

The game is solid EXCEPT for the Bob die. Here's the deal, roll it at the beginning of the turn, if Bob shows up then do what you should. However, if anything else shows up...ignore it. In a two player game the die is VERY unbalanced. When one player gets free action after free action and the other gets to move Bob one space forward it makes the game the absolute worst kind of terrible. 

I'd love to give the die a chance with more players but pretty much that's not gonna happen. Mostly I feel like throwing it in the trash and flipping a coin to see if Bob moves forward each turn.

The game play is similar to Ticket to Ride but plays quicker. Probably 20 or so double sided paintings make it so there is quite a bit of life in it. So far in 4 player games we go through 3 paintings. I can see me growing tired of it after going through all of the paintings. But my wife and daughters are loving it and they will enjoy playing it even after seeing all of the pictures.

RATING: 4
There is a target audience that will enjoy this game.  I am not part of that audience.

It's actually not a completely terrible game.  Basically the whole gag is making fun of Bob Ross (it's a race to be the most "chill").  Beyond that, the game play is kind of like a lighter, more random, and less balanced version of Ticket to Ride.  It involves collecting various colors of cards, trying to make certain sets of cards.  

Ultimately it's a light, "gag game" that has a small amount of strategy and a huge amount of randomness.  I think our game took 45 minutes, which in my mind was far too long for this type of game.

I have mixed feelings about the die (extra action is outright the best die face), but it keeps Bob's pace on the painting in check in an interesting way. Beyond that I really enjoy the action management and card play.

Okay, bought the game expecting this to be a complete ass hat cash grab. I actually kinda like the game. Is it super deep? No, it's not. It does work and there are plenty of variety in the paintings to keep it interesting. The game play is simple and effective even though there is a bit of a learning curve until you figure out the idea behind the color palates work and how to play the brush cards correctly.

Very good game. Having the Bob Ross Twitch play in the background is a must.

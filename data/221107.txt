RATING: 3
For a game that on the surface was all about player exploration and multiple paths to victory, there seems to have only been a single winning strategy. In that I now know that strategy, the game is both more replayable than Season 1 and a game I have no desire to ever play again.

After the 1st  session:
Surprisingly Season 2 did have a fresh feel to it. You still have the same basic actions, so you can definitely say that the game is Pandemic, but it’s amazing how different the experience is when you are delivering cubes around the board instead of trying get rid of them. Moreover I find the narrative more interesting as you start on a small map and explore new areas. It might well be that legacy games need (or at least I need) the excitement of discovery, and this is where Season 2 looks more promising than its predecessor. Still a bit early to tell whether the game is good but the initial impression is positive after the tedium of Season 1.

RATING: 9
So much fun, but it feels a job when you are playing it.  Winning a month feels more like you just didn't lose than it does that you won.  Hard decisions to make every step of the way, but it's a brilliant game, and absolutely worth buying for the experience.

My 10 is to counter all these dicks putting 1's for no reason other than being morons.  Even though you can only play through once it is a unique experience and most enjoyable if its anything like season 1.  Really at the end of the game you could just use whatever you created to keep playing that scenario.

RATING: 9
Incredibly tense, and the "luck of the draw" element from Pandemic means that the best laid plans of mice and men go oft awry.

We started a month hot and on a roll, well-positioned to accomplish multiple things, and everything went downhill so fast that we pushed the "Eject" button and just tried to not die, not even half of the way into the deck.

Oddly enough, I'm not sure that "fun" is the word I would use to describe it, because it feels almost like push-your-luck in trying to rack up achievements before time runs out.  That being said, there are lots of fun moments talking about how Washington is threatening to infect the whole country.

RATING: 7
Didn't enjoy it as much as the first, but still enjoyed the Legacy aspect of it.  The stakes didn't feel near as meaningful this time around though the map progression and dwindling resources certainly created the tension necessary to keep it interesting.  Most games were barely won when they were won.

Very impressed so far. I like the clever inversion of Pandemic, and the legacy elements have been interesting. I really love the game end bonus structure. Still, through 6 games, we haven't lost yet and haven't found any "holy crap" moments yet, so not quite as cool as Season 1 yet.

The plague came out of nowhere and ravaged the world. Most died within a week. Nothing could stop it. The world did its best. It wasn't good enough.

For three generations, we, the last fragments of humanity have lived on the seas, on floating stations called "havens." Far from the plague, we are able to provide supplies to the mainland to keep them (and us) from succumbing completely.

A really interesting twist on the Pandemic formula. Season 2 felt more organic than Season 1 did; instead of just doing the same thing over and over again with a few new rules like in Season 1, Season 2 felt like it kept progressing, introducing new mechanisms and pushing the story forward in a more meaningful way. This was a wonderful experience.

I found this to be a lot better balanced than season 1. There were great ways to mitigate the card draw and population loss luck. The story isn’t the strongest, but each game showed growth and they established methods for the game to progress even when losing if you planned ahead.

Pandemic Legacy revisited, good twist mechanism-ise, keeping a game that we’ve known and loved fresh, keeping a lot of mechanisms while changing it enough to create a new experience. Will update my rating after a few more plays.
UPDATE after March with possible SPOILERS: While I still appreciate the mechanisms and the struggle, I feel that -at least till this point in game- the story is not that engaging. The writing in the deck is quite basic, no huge twists in my opinion, like Season 1, where you felt like being on a rocky ride every single time, even during a month, things changing at any given turn. I hope things will kick it up a notch in the following months.

This game is hands-down better than Pandemic Legacy: Season 1. I had an absolute blast play-testing it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I played season 1 four times and would gladly do it again (and again) (tweaking the diffuculty slightly perhaps). a great design, great story arc/progression

this one got tedious by the time first run through ended. if you try to play having any prior knowledge the game just breaks 1/3 through. story arc is very uneven, with months that have nothing interesting happening (and the interesting part is largely limited to jan-march)

you can easily put yourself in a position where you have to lose 4 games in a row because winning conditions won't be reachable for next 2 months, but you can also find yourself with 3 people basically doing nothing the entire game except discarding cards while the 4th one is standing in one place picking up things from discard pile waiting for winning condition to activate (slightly exaggerating how our october/november/december looked)

Better than Season 1. Lots of great things to discover and doesn’t feel like a repeat.

The legacy aspects of this game are an improvement over Season 1, but the game itself is much less interesting. It felt like the game was mostly playing itself and the difficulty is extremely unbalanced. Very few games I played were close wins or loses and the randomness from the luck of the card draws are enormous.

Enjoyed season 1 a lot more. This one was either very hard or way too easy, and both options seemed dependant on the luck of your shuffle. Perhaps we erred in not deck thining more, but sometimes we started the game halfway lost due to a poor shuffle, and eventually lost December 1 turn from winning due to some poor draws. All in all, I think we're glad we played it, but the time and money may have been better spent elsewhere.

RATING: 10
This one retains the feel of Pandemic but makes some changes to the core mechanics and it works. Very few games can I say playing 7+ games of it in a row doesn't get boring but this one somehow manages to pull it off as we did that twice. Compared to Season 1, I would say the story isn't quite as interesting (but that's minor) but the gameplay itself is much better. Also because now the game has a strong exploration aspect, the game really feels like it evolves from game to game rather than mostly resetting like Season 1 does. I also appreciated that this one was simply more challenging. If you're a fan of Pandemic or cooperative games, you will very likely enjoy this. If you liked Season 1, then what are you waiting for?? This and Season 1 earn 10's from me just because they are the best game experiences I've had and were filled with memorable moments. There hasn't been a single game in the 32 total played that I've disliked. How can that not be a 10?

The thrilling storyline continues and so does the enjoyment of this legacy game.  Actions are similar to the base game and Season 1, but different enough that you feel the approach and direction has switched.  This makes for a welcomed twist.

Only about halfway through the campaign so far, but I've found Season 2 to be a bit of a letdown compared to Season 1. Part of this, I'm sure, is just that the novelty of the Legacy format has worn off somewhat, but I think there are some genuine problems with this game. Chief among those is that, rather than starting with the familiar base of vanilla Pandemic, the game starts out feeling quite unfinished, like we the players are meant to "unlock" the full game by opening the various mystery boxes that are dangled in front of you at every step. Getting new stuff to add to the game is cool, of course, but at this point I feel like this is the only reason I'm playing. The game in its current state is less engaging than I've ever found Pandemic before.

RATING: 8
This game far exceeds Pandemic Legacy Season 1, and not simply because it's not "just more Pandemic again". The way the Legacy components grow the scope of the game are truly exciting this time and I like just how many Legacy aspects they've managed to utilize. Your pool of choices continuously grows as you play and you're forced to make meaningful (and permanent) decisions about what you can afford to lose while working to rebuild civilization.

Nine plays in. The Legacy stuff is better than Season 1, but unlike Season 1, this isn't starting from the great game that is Pandemic, it's starting from a mediocre game (at best).

Another fantastically exciting legacy game here, and another of the most enjoyable and memorable gaming experiences I've ever had. I think I enjoyed the gameplay of season 2 more than the first, but the "experience" of the first a little more. However, there are way more options for the players to take in this game and non-mandatory avenues to explore.

We've made a habit of getting together every New Year's Eve for a while now and having a day and night of gaming, and this was the main event for 2017/18. We started the night with a few of our group's regulars and played the prologue 3/4 times fairly late in the evening. After we made a start on the main game, we enjoyed the game so much our friends ended up staying at ours for the next few days until we had finished the entire game. They arrived at ours on the 30th, we started playing the game that night, and they left close to midnight on the 1st following our final December game (we squeezed one last game in as a few of us were working on the 2nd). 

Can't think of any higher praise than enjoying the game so much we basically played through it in its entirety, only stopping to sleep, eat and watch two games of rugby. Absolutely superb.

After Pandemic Legacy: Season 1 my hopes were quite high since I enjoyed it a lot (until the translation mistake).

After 6 rounds (1 loss) so far I can say that this is currently WAY better than Season 1, because it is a new game.
S1 was simply Pandemic with a story and a few twists. Here it is a new setting, a new game with interesting mechanics.
My full comment will follow after I finished the campaign.

WARNING: ** - Very Small Spoilers - **

...

Better than Season 1! It's much more challenging, and most certainly not too easy. I don't know what rule Rahdo got wrong, or if he just got really lucky, but the difficulty is significantly higher than any normal Pandemic game, since with gradually reducing supplies and multiple copies of cities in the infection deck it's possible to get several incidents ("outbreaks") even in your set-up infection step. A couple of our games we knew were lost after the first player had taken his turn (thankfully, the "long game" goals of Recon and making new city connections allowed us to better prepare for future plays).

All in all, it's much more interesting of a system than Season 1, and more replayable, IMO, since your board is going to look very different each time you play.

Very influenced by the fact that I really enjoyed the first game-- having this be a new game had us struggle with some strategies, but I really loved the story in this one more. While the first one was just maybe the best legacy game I had seen then, this then does a great job on top of that. Loved opening dossiers and stickering and playing a slightly different game entirely... but mostly my A++ is for the story. :D

I'll keep comments generic given the nature of the game, but suffice to say that after playing the prologue, I'm struck by the fact that they seem to have taken an already wonderful game experience and found ways to up the ante in terms of tension. Our same group of three is eager to get started in earnest.

Update: lost by a hair in the first half of January. Overall, possibly tougher than the predecessor but we're enjoying the new mechanics added in this version. This is promising.

Update: We've now played through June and I can say without reservation that this is another "10" rated game. If Season 1 was groundbreaking as the definitive legacy-style game bolted onto an already solid cooperative game, Season 2 succeeds in not simplistically duplicating the same mechanics from the prior version and presenting something new that is still very much in the same vein. The designers did their homework and succeeded in creating a worthy sequel.

We prefer the story better from season 1, and we are enjoying it as a 2-player experience.  It's difficult to determine if we are preferring the game play more due to the game mechanics or just because we are enjoying each others' company more on this version.

A few things left a sour taste in our mouth, but we liked it overall.

This rating is very preliminary, as we are in the process of playing this and I am just getting used to the new game mechanics. (1 play of Prologue, 1 play of Jan (W))

This is quite different from the other Pandemic games I've played as the central mechanic is protecting cities with supply cubes and hopefully keeping the infection from ever getting off the ground to begin with. The board starts with a very small number of cities on the board, but what this means is that there are 3 duplicates of each in the Infect deck and 4 of each in the player deck and things can still run away in a hurry. The overall play and economy of this game is pretty different in the early going as well.

Again, hard to say how I will like it at the end, but I so far have enjoyed the differences here, particularly the expanding board and the exploration aspects which are quite a change from standard Pandemic. The Legacy element seems a lot more "open-world" in this than in Season 1 as well, which is interesting. You can definitely tell this is a second generation legacy title, as the mechanic is used in what I consider a more central way here as the early going of this is pretty simple with a very restricted board which will open up as you play it. Enjoying it.

Scattered thoughts...

- man, there's a lot of silver shit all over the place now
- November and its accompanying plot point COMPLETELY redeem what is otherwise a slow slog through the summer
- has the pacing of a Netflix show: lots of discovery and excitement in the early episodes, doldrums in the middle, and a big, shocking finish at the end
- I want something SO COOL like the cool thing in Sea Fall, and I didn't get it
- SO MANY GOD DAMNED STICKERS
- Seriously, half of your time is spent doing accounting
- Some really good Easter eggs hidden in here, especially call-backs to S1.  Search Atlanta to see what I mean

My friend Brett and I just saved the world.  Again.

Gameplay-wise, this is the opposite of season one, which was action and drama right out the gate but fumbled the ending.  Season two begins more slowly, with changes to the base Pandemic game that make it more random and unsatisfying, but things ramp steadily upwards to a wonderfully tense final few months where every move counts and I was sure something bad was going to happen.

Many aspects of the game have been improved upon since the first season.  I particularly liked the new character creation method and the way upgrades and scars are handled now.  There's a steady flow of limited-time use cards that go into the deck, and the constant tension of using them vs keeping them to pad out the distance between epidemics is very engaging.

The writing is still the weakest part of the game.  I appreciate they're trying to tell a story on cards, but not every piece of prose.  Has to be in sentence fragments.  For it to be compelling.  There's still no narrative branching and the storyline is even more on rails than in the first season; if you don't do something by the time the game wants you to do it, it does it for you anyway (usually with a penalty for being so slow).

Nonetheless, this an excellent gaming experience and well worth the hours we spent.  I don't think we've reached the pinnacle of what Legacy games can be yet, but the Pandemic games are coming closest.

[25 Jan 2018] - 8 (5 plays)
We played up through the end of Feb in the game. The game play has aspects of Pandemic but the supplying goal is not as tense yet. The real reason for the high rating is from the mystery that the game currently has. There are a few clues here and there but for the most part I'm not sure how things are going to progress. The mystery of the scar system also makes it a tougher decision whether to stay in a city or not. I did once and nothing happened when I scratched off the first spot. Feels much different than PL: Season 1 - not everything is a fire that needs fighting.

We didn't play the first season so we didn't know what exactly to expect - and the hype set the expectations rather high. We've played up to March, and we've been blown away so far. Exceptional game, just a great experience, hope the rest of the game keeps this up - it's just getting better and better.
Edit: An addition, after completing the game. Not changing the rating. Currently my only 10 rating game, we enjoyed it immensely.

Absolutely love this game and its predecessor!
4 Players (Mom, Dad and two kids).  So far, the mechanic of placing cubes instead of removing them is a cool twist. Objectives seem more non-linear than Season 1 which is great. Exploration theme is very well done.

Seems a bit more swingy than base Pandemic. Some games can start off in a VERY bad position before you even get going. 
Current Record: 8-3
[o]
Jan Win (5 plague events)
Feb Loss, Loss (lost both games on 8th incident the turn before last objective completed)
Mar Win (6 plague events)
Apr Win (Got quite lucky this one, cards came out in right order several times, 5 plague events)
May Loss, Win (Easy win once we got the extra supply cubes!)
June Win (Pretty easy win, but recon of Europe make it looks bad next month)
July Win (Hollow Men not as big a problem as expected)
Aug Win
Sept Win (Lots of changes before and during this one, figured we had no hope, but some clever use of our powers allowed recon of Asia for the win)

Learned the following a few games in:
1) Don't be too afraid to take exposure because spending critical actions avoiding it will make it hard to win games
2) Searching can be VERY valuable

Season one had more variability - I definitely felt like we were being 'railroaded' into a certain path in this one. Also, there's stuff you could do, but no reason to do it: you won't always get a reward either. So we quit doing it. And it made no real difference in the long run. But if you don't do the stuff you are supposed to do, well... it just gives it to you for free later anyway. Wanted more consequences. Bit too easy overall.

We've only just kicked into Pandemic Legacy, Season 2, and this game does a lot to appeal to me over the first iteration. It's particularly more unique than Season 1, and has done a lot more to engage me as a player.

The adventure goes on! Great game. (update after half of the game) 
Story, involvment and ways to upgrade characters and the game board at the end of games is better and even more fun as S1. On the other side, the balance during games is not as solid as standard Pandemic (and S1). Nevertheless two thumbs up, because we want to play play play!

RATING: 8
Half way through thoughts - got better in April.  For the first three months of the game I was kind of bored and uninterested to the point that a real life month had gone by until we decided to pick up where we left off.  I kind of wish the game started you with an area already reconned with all the stuff that comes with having an area reconned, and maybe having to turn on a haven or two.  The campaign narrative is nothing to write home about, but it doesn’t have to be.  Storytelling/Thematic games shouldn’t rely on walls of flavor text to tell stories, they should rely on thematic mechanisms and dramatic gameplay arcs that immerse players in the game(Agricola comes to mind).   Somewhere around reconning a landmass or two, Pandemic starts to do this, and does it well.  I’m looking forward to all the things we have yet to explore and all the challenges we have yet to face.

***Playing this has also made me want for euro’ish campaign games (cooperative or competetive) that can be reset and played from different angles.  It would also be nice if they could release additional packs that add on to what is already in the box once you finish this season.

I am rating this quite a bit below Season One, but it's still a great game that I enjoyed a lot.  Most of the things I said about Season 1 are true, but there are two main knocks against Season 2 that kept it lower on my rankings...

* The narrative isn't as engaging (but it's still solid)
* The difficulty varies by too much, and is too dependent on doing the "right" thing in previous games.  There's a lot more hidden information than in Season 1, so it can be difficult to make informed decisions, especially when you keep expecting the sort of "ah, ha - screwed ya!" moments that you got in Season One, so you start second-guessing yourself a lot.

Still a great game, with a difficult and engaging puzzle to solve!

Oh its different, trying to keep cubes on the board rather than remove them, but its still essentially pandemic and it is good fun. Story is really good and its not gotten too difficult at this stage (Jan-Mar). 

I really like that a prologue is included which you can play until you are happy with the new mechanics, and I really love the map development which is suitably difficult to achieve but gives awesome abilities once unlocked (cough-Europe)....but where did Essen go? :(

We never played Pandemic prior to Season 1. Unlike most sequels, Season 2 tops Season 1 with our group. At first, we felt it wasn't as good as season 1. It wasn't until July in Season 2 that we started to love Season 2. The main things that brought us to this realization were the revealing of the Season 2 map, the story-line revealed through the searches, the components awared through the boxes, and the character cards. We loved Season 1. It was unlike any other board game we ever played before. Season 2 takes it to yet another level. Just don't see how a board game can get better than this, but hopeful there could be even better to come!

I like the new twists on the Pandemic gameplay. I feel that the legacy aspects are actually well matched with the new mechanics. The story is not as explosive as the one in the first season but so far it’s an enjoyable experience.

We've won most of our games but looking back I noticed several major rule errors. Hard to keep track of what's what with the rules constantly changing.

Finally finished the game. And downgraded the rating to reflect the overall feel. I thought the games were too short. We either won too easily or were defeated too fast. Either way, the game is not what I would call balanced. 

Another thing I didn’t like, everything is too much on rails. Win or lose the same story unfolds. Sure, there’s some incentive to win but I wish there was more branching based on the decisions made within the game.

An incredible gaming experience. Season 2 is even more intense than the first, it gives the impression of being even more scripted while giving more freedom. This is largely due to the exploration mechanics. The material is great, the illustrations are perfect.

I like how the designers took the Pandemic gameplay and turned it on its head. The story doesn't have as many "WOW!" moments as Season 1, but that may be simply a product of sky-high expectations. So, no, it doesn't top Season 1, but it's still a lot of fun, and quite a bit harder too!

[thoughts]

1/3 of way through game - not enjoying as much as season 1 - feels a little bit of a repetitive slog through the games. Let's see what the first major twist is - and hope that livens it up a little.

felt somewhat 'unfair' in March as we choose to do one thing when doing something else would have made the game far easier. This was purely random and searching one location was just 'better' than searching some other place. We only searched the 'better' place in the second half of March and by then it was too late to help us. Hopefully this kind of thing wont happen too often.

- so far rate at 8

now 1/2 way through and things haven't changed much. Still just slowly slogging through with no real twists or turns. OK but much weaker than season 1, lowered the rating a bit - down to 7.

Season 2 is better than season 1 for us. My SO and I play Pandemic a lot. We had over 30 plays before doing season 1. S1 let me down in that I knew the game and they took away control and added lame twists to it. But S2 starts with low control and then you gain more and more ways to affect the game how you like it to be. Perfect arc.

I was a playtester (first 5ish months, than a couple about 3/4 of the way through, 8 wins 2 losses compared to my 15 W 3 L in season 1) in summer of 2016. While this was a while ago, a guy I played with did read the final rulebook, and didn't notice any changes so I assume outside of some possible numbers tweaking I played a near final version. I will try to avoid spoilers beyond what you know after reading the rulebook.

First of all if you haven't played season 1 you should probably start with that. While season 1 kind of gradually holds your hand introducing legacy concepts, here it seems they already assume you are already familiar. 

I really liked the aspects related to why the initial map is so small. It was also well integrated with the stronger story in season 2. There are a couple months where your objective departs somewhat significantly from regular Pandemic, though the necessity to set collect cards remain. 

There are more diverging paths than in season 1, but there are still a couple forced convergences to make sure you get to certain narratives in the campaign.

The supply cubes vs. disease cubes I could take or leave.

There seems to be a lot more variety sticker upgrades in this one. In season 1 I remember running out of upgrades we wanted so we were spending points just to spend points. Not so here. I assume the more upgrades here also helps mitigate the fact that there is a greater fear of a character dying in this season.

This is definitely more complex than season 1. Not just because it assumes you know legacy concepts, but also there are some fairly different actions that you acquire during the game. Personally I thought all those added actions made for a bit too much overhead as the game progressed.

Do I like this more than season 1? Well, if the two were the same length, definitely. However, whereas I played season 1 15 times in 12.5 hours, here sessions would go on for up to 2 hours. I think my group for season 1 was quicker, but there are still some stuff in season 2 that I think lengthen the game, and I would guess my season 1 group would still take at least 75 minutes per game for season 2.

I don't really know how to comment on this without many spoilers, but I absolutely loved this. It took a solid core of Pandemic and added two fantastic things: exploration and preparation instead of firefighting. We LOVED the exploration aspects- connecting new cities, searching in ones we'd connected, and needing the right city card combinations to unlock entire new areas of the map. And one of my biggest complaints with Pandemic is that there was no way to pre-plan in the areas that were issues. Thematically, at some point, you'd stop just curing the diseases that occurred. You'd actively prevent cities from getting more infected.

We also really enjoyed the story line and thought that season 2 was more immersive and thematic than season 1 was, which heavily appeals to me.

Not a real fan of Pandemic Games (but I'm ok to play with them), and I haven't really loved the first season because the unlocks and scenario feel too linear.
But this games, I really fall in love with it. I love the universe, the ternsion in the narrative and unlocks. About them, I really feel that I control the way the campaign unfold. I'll be glad to do it many more times !
(As a side note, despite I don't like the throwable aspect of this game, I made it fully resetable, so I'm ok with this aspect)

RATING: 9.5
It was impossible to live up to the expectations set by Season 1, and Season 2 did a good job of turning the core Pandemic mechanic on its head (you're now delivering cubes instead of removing cubes) and the character creation aspects involved some welcome and interesting improvements. 
The difficulty of early game missions swung wildly until the second half of the game and we found the difficulty to let up significantly (maybe almost too much). Great overall experience though!
The silver dust from the scratch off cards was a little ridiculous to manage and it got everywhere!

RATING: 9
Arguably better than Season 1, I was skeptical that was much more they could squeeze out of the classic Pandemic mechanics but I'm happy to admit I'm wrong. The biggest change here is the fact that you're rebuilding the board as you go rather than starting with a complete world map, a nice addition that really boosts the personal experience you'll get from the complete campaign.

It's a 10! So what's not to like, though? The story is unrelentingly grim, even compared to the first season. Also, we seemed to have fewer total turns during each game when compared to normal Pandemic, so mistakes seemed amplified and the luck seems a little more swingy. But these are minor things compared to the overall fun to be had.

Played through august and decided to stop playing after a loss in september.  I got to the point where i was playing the game just because i wanted to finish it, not because i was enjoying the gameplay.

I will never know how the story plays out, but at this point I don't really care...

The fluid legacy structure was absolutely brilliant, heightening the sense of discovery and exploration.  The narrative also felt more dire, with some very cinematic moments. It would've been a 10 only if the game had presented a stronger challenge. We never lost our original characters, and from May to September we never lost a game. Thankfully, the difficulty ramped up in the end, with a very shocking twist of fate.

RATING: N/A
I haven't yet got round to playing any legacy games yet (i will be getting season 1 shortly) but while i understand the motivation of the '1' ratings, as legacy games may be for a particular category of gamer so people who don't like the genre don't play the game and those who do will - by their the fact they like the genre - will on average rate the game higher, so the sample is skewed.

HOWEVER this mentality is actually counterproductive because it will just make people who don't agree with you (a majority of the raters) increase their own ratings to counter balance, the net outcome being an even higher rated game than if you hadn't given the low rating. (even without this effect, people will dismiss the 1 ratings because they know the game is not that bad, and will see a huge number of 10 ratings giving the impression that the game is widely accepted as better than season 1, which may or may not be the case)

Please rate sincerely otherwise people will buy the game based on false ratings

RATING: 10
Prologue - This took a bit for us to wrap our heads around and I was a bit worried for the rest of the game - but I think it's existence is a great idea.

Jan-Feb - The game has already started to sprawl for us and we're getting more use to the flow.  Already we want to do little other than keep playing this game.

Mar-April - March was brutal and a touch demoralizing, but after one of the discoveries in April the hook has definitely been sunk.

May-July - Started to get the hang of the game, winning more than losing.  Very fascinating overall though some of the mechanics make it far more mechanical and the games far longer than Season 1 (Though this would be reduced if we played less optimally.)

Aug-Oct - We're crushing it and on a nice winning streak (Though we've put a lot of work into that and keeping a very clean board state).  You really need to keep on the offensive for the game as far as we can figure and end the games quickly (as far as turns, not as far as time, each game is going about two hours for us).  I both want to rush to the end but also don't want it to end yet.

Final - The winning streak kept up and our board was nice and clean by the end, though the last few turns were extremely tense and balanced on a knife edge.  Overall I enjoyed this more than Season 1 and it certainly has more variability.  The downsides are than the middle months can drag slightly and I can see traps groups could get caught into that would make the game less fun.  It also remains a bit unavoidably fiddly.  I wonder what it would be like with a group that did less long term planning and just sort of went for it - I feel like the games would flow a lot faster and with funding you could use some of the cool events, but you'd also take a lot more hits along the way.

At the end of the day however, I had a blast and cannot wait for the next season - but I can also see how this could turn sour for some people, even those who really enjoyed Season 1.

This game is so, so good. My goodness gracious. We are only through the month of May, so less than halfway through, and it is an amped up version of the original. More difficult; higher stakes; more complicated tasks for objectives; and even thematically, the stakes are just higher and more serious than the ________________(redacted)_____ in Season 1.

Highly recommend already, regardless of how we end up doing.

We're going to start with April - playing the game with my wife and me and we're having a blast until now. The game is very different from season 1 and regular pandemic and stands on its own except for some small links to season 1 but nothing that stops you from playing this without having played the first season. I still recommend playing season 1 first as this one is much more difficult and it will help you to understand how the legacy game works. We have played the game 7 times now (including the intro scenario) and I'm looking forward already to my next games.

RATING: 6.5
Another fun legacy game. I liked it a lot, but not as much as season 1. I think there were a lot of high pressure situations/rounds and it made it all the more thematic feeling. However, a lot of progression felt forced at times. Don't want to say too much, but overall well worth the play. 
** Spoilers below **





I think the game often made it seem like certain things were mandatory but didn't explain it well. And other things weren't mandatory it seemed and if you don't find them it completely breaks the game to the point where you can lose without anyone having a turn (didn't happen to us, but the concept is still baffling). Feels easier to alpha play than in season 1 for some reason; maybe because it seems like there are just certain things you have to do and it doesn't make sense to go a different way a lot of the time. 
Story is good and connects well to season one but falls apart in certain parts. 

Excited that we didn't score in the bottom tier!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The first game was overly simple compared to most Pandemic games, but it quickly became just as addicting as Season 1.  There are more legacy elements compared to Season 1.  That adds to the thrill for me, but makes the game harder to make repeatable (covering scratched clues and making stickers reusable).  So much to talk about, but I don't want to spoil anything.  Generally, I liked the statistical changes in how the epidemics work, and the ability combinations were key, making the tactics different enough from the first season.  I'll likely buy a second game to make repeatable as I did the first season, but the map stickers and connections will be harder to make temporary.  Gloomhaven and Skyrim VR may take priority.

I wasn't sure that a second season would have the same impact as the first season - much like with tv series, you go into the second season knowing what to expect so there's less room for the designers to surprise you. It turns out that being familiar with the format has no impact on my enjoyment of the game. The box felt immediately familiar when we opened it, with the same kind of setup for your first game as there was in season 1, but with tantalising gaps for things to be added as we progress through the campaign.

I love the fact that there's a prologue level included this time so you can get to grips with the basic premise or try it out with different groups of people before touching any of the legacy aspects of the game. The prologue is a bit dry and basic, but it serves its purpose of familiarising you with the basic mechanics and game materials.

We're loving it so far, and I think it's only going to get better!

The jury is still out on this one, but it seems to freshen things up. I really dig the post apocalyptic vibe plus the exploring aspect. I actually kind of hoped they'd changed the core mechanics even more, as I don't really care for the base game anymore; with the two Legacies, there's no reason for me to play base Pandemic anymore. It's actually funny: I'd never rate the base game/system this high.

RATING: 8
The introduction was fun but not easy - we played it twice. January was haaaaaard - we did not manage to win (lost four times since we wanted to win at least one before proceeding) - that was really frustrating :(. Glad that February was not that difficult for us - now we are motivated again to proceed with March ;)

All in all, this seems to be a worthy - but more difficult - successor to Pandemic Legacy 1. We like the story more then the first one - character development is better, too. We also like the new mechanics. So, again, it is a really good game. We only hope that the difficulty will not be too hard in the months coming ...

Edit: Rating down to 8 - as a two player game with only two characters it is simply too difficult. As a result, the game can get quite frustrating. This was not the case with Season 1. However, still a very good game.

RATING: 5
WARNING: THIS COMMENT WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS!!!

--------------

4 games in; Prologue, 2 in January, and an easy win in February. Really impressed by how they've managed to mix up the formula by almost doing a reverse Pandemic. This is my first Legacy game where nothing but the setting has been spoiled for me from the get-go. The map is really neat. I'm finding that I prefer doing recon for undiscovered areas, and don't care so much about winning and losing at this point. I discovered North America, then Europe, and lastly South America in the past two games. Getting Europe is definitely worth it for fast travel. 

I'm enjoying the game, though it feels a little too basic and confined for my tastes. Having only 9 cities to bounce between early on and discovered cities being fairly low risk for plague cubes makes staying in the central area the best idea. I do like the idea of exploring cities, even if it gives the game a lack of focus. I am more invested in the story of finding the missing leaders versus season 1's story of an out of control virus. Also it seems weird to me that this game acknowledges season 1 happened, but doesn't really point to anything other than that year being the beginning of the decline of civilization. Having said that, even though I'm more invested in the story here, I prefer the familiarity of season 1's game play. That's the case so far anyway. Like season 1, I can't wait to push through this game to see what happens next.

---------

FINAL THOUGHTS:

I don't know that I regret rushing out to buy this, but it certainly wasn't what I expected. The game quickly ramped up its difficulty in April or May, making Epidemics added in based on the amount of city cards discovered. So while I was discovering and exploring cities, which is what the game pushes you to do, I was effectively shooting myself in the foot for bloating up the player and infection decks. Being able to put cards in box 6 helped with this, but I made the mistake of thinning out the infection deck first when I should have done both at a fairly equal rate. Between these two things, I honestly think Season 2 was far too difficult to be that enjoyable. Games for me were lasting 20-30 minutes, on average. Only one game that I remember actually had me hanging in there until I squeaked out a victory.

The summer was particularly rough. I really thought that there was no way I would ever win a game again. I get that this is supposed to be a post-apocalyptic future where hope is in short supply, but this game REALLY made me feel hopeless. Once the revelation in October happened, I was dumbfounded. It literally was a mind-fuck moment to find out that we were playing as the Faded all along. I didn't see that coming at all, even though the signs were there. That twist on the overall story is the one thing keeping me from rating this game much lower.

On top of everything else, getting into the Hollow Men's HQ of Utopia and injecting your characters to squeak them along to Johannesburg is the most difficult thing I've ever tried to pull off in any Pandemic game. I gave up halfway into the second game in December because there was no way I was winning. I ended the game scoring a measly 45 out of 1000 points, and was completely frustrated by the whole game. I'm glad the designers took feedback from the first game, but I think the difficulty of this game approaches the point of not being fun. Given that I'm not really a Pandemic fan to begin with, I didn't have a good experience overall. If it wasn't for that revelation of playing as the Faded, this would have been a complete stinker for me. If I were to ever play this again, it would be with 2 or 3 players. 4 is simply too difficult.

2. Seafall
3. Pandemic Legacy: Season 1

Season 2 was an improvement on Season 1 for me.  I liked how they took Pandemic and went in a more interesting direction and deviated from the game we all know.  The game was a fun experience I will most likely visit again down the road.  My biggest complaint, which may be limited to my copy, was that some of the stickers were not holding well and needed to be pressed back into place pretty much every game.  Discarded my copy once we were done due to this.

Better in some ways than the original, but a few little complaints keep it from reaching the same level. 

First, the size of the player deck might prevent you from drawing certain cards you really need in time. Some games we only drew 1/3rd of the deck before we won or lost. That said, we only lost twice, so I'm not saying it's too hard, but those 2 losses were seemingly unavoidable at the time.

My 2nd complaint is that there was little incentive to switch characters. Maybe that's because we like to spread out the character upgrades so everyone feels like his/her character is improving and important, but that makes all 4 characters better than any new character.

That said, I loved the new upgrade system, the exploration, the completely new way to look at cubes, the completely new actions, and more forgiving end-game scoring (had best result first 2 plays of Season 1, but then went 12-0 with Bravo Team showing up and didn't score highest), and it's still probably my 2nd favorite gaming experience ever. I will immediately purchase Season 3.

I adored Season one. Ranked it 9/10 I believe, The idiocy the designers have display here defies belief. They have tried to add too much freedom. In season one they knew what you would open and reveal and when you would do it. In season 2, what you open and when (legacy wise) differs hugely from group to group. This makes the game impossible to balance and my game has quickly devolved into an unbalanced,unplayable mess that cannot be rectified.
It is either too easy or impossibly hard. I love Pandemic, Pandemic Legacy S1 and Legacy as a whole. But this is a mess.

As good as Season 1. My only complaint is that some months seemed a little unbalanced (too easy or hard), but the overall experience blows away any game that I have ever played. My family and I were whooping and hollering at the different reveals, the end of the game was an experience we will not soon forget.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
The Legacy part in this is probably an 11 as I love how they made discovery more "open" and allowed for a lot more small and several big Legacy moments during games. I think it does cause the problem of the game becoming very swingy depending on what you happen to find when but I also feel the game gives you some good hints where to find some bigger things and later in the game it is getting very mitigateable which maybe makes the game almost a bit too easy at times (especially compared to the start where you could get quiet randomly be hit pretty hard). And let's face it this is a coop game in the end so except for difficulty level enjoyment (which might differ from person to person anyway) who cares if our game was harder/easier than other ones. I e.g. read March was a super rough month for a lot of people, we pretty much breathed through that after 2 very rough February games, which gave us a few more upgrades and then we had pretty lucky draws. 
The only reason I rate this slightly lower than Pandemic Legacy Season 1 is that I still adore the core Pandemic system (Pandemic is still one of my 10 rated games) and I just feel that at it's core the system in Season 1 is mechanically the better game. So while I probably prefer the way Legacy elements were implemented in Season 2, the core game - while really solid - is just a little better in Season 1 and I think overall that made Season 1 the better Legacy "game" for me. 

Still an absolute fantastic experience and I'm looking forward to Season 3.

For a second opinion: My boyfriend, who is ok with base Pandemic but doesn't like it as much as I do and who is less "involved" in the hobby but played both Seasons with me, says he enjoyed Season 2 more than 1 based of the more "open" Legacy elements. (So if you read comments, 2 opinions for 1 for you :D )

RATING: 7.5
I'm sure the rating will go up once things start kicking off!

EDIT: Up from 7.5 to 8.5 now (Feb + March wins)

EDIT 2: Completed. We enjoyed the game but the 3 of us found the game much too easy. Perhaps we just made a lot of good choices, in the right order, and also and had a lot of luck on our side too, but we didn’t lose a single game. My main gripe is the ton of admin necessary which broke up the game or felt like a chore to do at the end of each session. This probably sounds more negative than it should be as overall it was a fun experience. We just didn’t feel it was anywhere in the same league as Pandemic Legacy 1.

This provides a very different Pandemic experience, cleverly provided within the same Pandemic card / epidemic structure. The major difference is that you're putting out cubes (resources) instead of removing them, and if a city without resources gets revealed at end-of-turn, it breaks. The feel of the game though feels wilder. With fewer cities, cards are repeated in the decks, and quick successions in the same city will stuff you no matter how well you're playing. It’s offset by the fact that you don't need to move around as much. But this is offset by the fact that it takes longer to collect and distribute resources than simply to remove cubes per the original. While there are still clever risk-management plans to conceive and implement, which is the charm of the game, some of these games have just smacked us too hard, too quickly, and ended up proving an exercise in futility. I love the legacy aspects, deciding on strategic improvements at the end of each game. But I'm hoping the rest of the season picks the game up, because I don't want too many more games that end after each player has had two or three turns due to rotten and unavoidable card draw. I'm still going to enjoy the season but the rating is well down compared to Season 1 so far.

Seven games in and even though the mechanic is known after playing season one the games is different enough that it feels different.

It is quite different from the base Pandemic game, but that is great for someone who has played so much of it. Looking forward to the rest.

Initial rating is a 9, having only playing the Prologue and January.  

So far it seems familiar, yet different enough from Season 1.  I liked the new recon/discovery actions and the allocation of supplies.  The plague mechanism removing supplies is different and unique vs season 1.  It appears to have many ways to customize the board with supply lines, too.

Characters and abilities are getting a little harder to get used to from Season 1 and need to deprogram myself from other Pandemic games.

Only played the prologue and January so far. What they kept from Legacy 1, and is for me sort of the key of the succes, is that 1 game doesn't take long, which makes you're eager to discover more and you'll probably play 2 or 3 games  in a row AND will still have enough time to play an other (full-sized) game. 
But off course, in season 1 the Legacy-mechanism was something new for me, here it wasn't, which kills some of the freshness for me personally. 
What is fun, is that now you're discovering the world and his state. 

According to the fact if the designers can surprise me like they did in Season 1 or not, rating can go up or down.

RATING: 8
This one is not as a good as Season 1.  It is still exciting, but I do not think the game play flows as well as the first season.

I think part of the problem is that if you play efficiently, you can "win" the games fairly easy.  (We have lost only one game so far.)  By doing so, we are not unlocking content at the rate I think the designers' intended.  My group has contemplated throwing a game, but we are too hard headed to do so.

We are excited to get together and play and discover this season.  If you loved Season 1, I do not think you will be disappointed.

I ranked the First Season with 10 and had looked forward for the second one so much, but the game came with less motility (you place supply and plague cubes instead of 4 different color disease ones), has strange vaccine mechanic (we removed up to 30 cards and don't feel it's cool), our characters are still alive (it's July though) and have less individuality (balanced but not fun). All the narrative felt less exciting, but maybe it's just us. Wait till the end, maybe I'll add stars.

The game is harder than Season 1, which makes it feel so much rewarding to win. The game is set in a world where there is a mayor shortage, and you can really feel it.

This rating is from about halfway through the campaign. So far I like Season 2 better than Season 1. There are two things I like about it:

1) The underlying game mechanism is different. It might not be "better" but I've played enough Pandemic at this point that "different" means "more fun"

2) The exploration aspect is super fun and keeps the excitement of knowing you have more to discover present throughout the campaign (so far)

RATING: 10
[12/03] Halfway through the game I have to go and say it:

PANDEMIC LEGACY: SEASON 2 IS —undoubtedly— 2017's BEST GAME

It was not an easy task achieving that having in mind what the First Season offered us three years ago, but Matt Leacock and his peers have just exceeded themselves. 

Just attend to one minor change that seems simple but carries within itself the seed to great potential: the fact that, in this game, we're not scientists racing after some vaccine againts the souless legions that threaten our planet; this time around we're survivors of the plague that asolated the Earth trying to survive in a world that need resources. So, instead of eliminating disease cubes you have to put resources cubes in every city that is within the boundaries of the net, a huge collaborative global scale effort in a World that is more unkown to us than ever. 

That alone, as I was saying, is enough to keep you wandering about what the heck is going on but, fortunately, good things do not come in "ones", and the games get significantly better than its predecessor as you progress. 

Really, a game for gamers. A game that takes the word and kicks it in its butt. A vital experience that demands you , just wanted to be clear about it, to absolutely love it. There's no other way around it: YOU HAVE TO LOVE PANDEMIC LEGACY 2.

Just lost March 4x in a row between the two games I'm running -- lost 2x last night and 1st try in April,  2x today with Faye, even knowing what needed to be done all too well. I HATE games in which you have lost due to the opening shuffle of the cards but don't know it until you've played it out, your actions cannot possibly do more than delay the defeat, and that is what happens in this game in this month. It's rating and ranking have just taken a MAJOR dive.

EDIT: Just lost May 2x, again due to the opening shuffle, defeated on the 4th turn due to 8 Incidents with no way to stop them. FINALLY were able to get to Lost Haven & get more cubes -- too late. Were never able to draw enough cards to Recon Europe, either. Rating now down to a 3. I'd lower it to a 2, but I'm not going to quit on Faye.

Update: Bumped the rating to a 10. All I mentioned previously holds true and in addition the decision and options you make really define how the further games will feel. We're now heading into October and I'm seriously considering picking up a second copy as I'm fascinated how different decisions in the game would make the game feel.

Updated Dec 4,2017: Rating bumped to 9.5. We're through April now and I'm am just loving the spins on this game. It certainly is a bit more luck dependent but this far in we can see ways to mitigate those elements and even then the tension is consistently high. I was having a couple of concerns that thankfully did not become an issue (and which I will not mention further.. cause spoilers) and am finding the story and how it evolves quite intriguing. All of that would get the game to a 9... however I find when I'm not playing the game I'm pondering what will come next, thinking about what might be the best strategy for the next game and anxious awaiting the next play. That easily ticks it up to the 9.5 range. 
Updated Nov 9, 2017: rating: 8: Have made it through the early Jan now and the tension of the game is exactly as expected. Solid offering so far and looking forward to seeing how it unfolds. I suspect my rating will go up as we play through the following months based on what I've experienced thus far. 
Original:Holding off rating until I get a bit into the main game but have played the prologue and really like the twists on familiar mechanisms... Just thinking about the implications with twists when we get into the legacy aspects  make me both anxious and excited.

Through January so far really cool.  Interesting take on the already established mechanisms of Pandemic.  This time adding and moving cubes as opposed to simply taking them off the board.  I can see this working very well, but could be tough to manage as we continue.  We were able to recon one area, and connect a few more cities.  Hoping this makes it a little easier since each deck (Player and Infection) have a few more cards in each.  Since some cities only have 1 or two cards, perhaps that will make them potentially breakout less, even though it'll be slightly harder to move and cover all of that ground.  First night had me wanted to play more and more, need to find out what happens!

As we went on this game was pretty awesome.  Not a ton of changes throughout, and the overall objectives stayed the same...until November/December.  November made it a bit harder, cool stuff.  Then December made it impossible.  The was nothing to let us know the game might be flipped on it's head and the last things you needed to complete were damned near impossible.  I know our group is not the most efficient nor the best players, but feeling like we had a chance would have been nice.  Instead (like Season 1) we just ran through the motions of December and unhappily and frustratingly lost both times.  A game that felt like it was a puzzle and a challenge ultimately wound down to a simple luck of the draw with that luck being incredibly stack against us.  Boo.

We enjoyed the first game well enough that the second is a guaranteed purchase.

Update: We've played the prologue a couple of times, and then through the first half of February. It feels harder than Season 1, IMO.  So, I'm tentatively giving it a rating of 8, though I can see it having the potential to be much higher.

Update 2: We're through March. No major twists as of yet, but I expect one soonish. Probably April or May, based on the idea of the year being divided into thirds like Season 1 was.  I'm enjoying the exploration aspect to the game quite a bit. I've bumped the rating to a 9, as a result.

I like the changes to the Pandemic gameplay but feel like the designers went overboard on the legacy elements in this one.

Definitely becomes un-fun by March.  I'll continue to play to discover more, but this is frustratingly punishing.

And like whiplash, it's now very easy?  Still unfun.

Arlena feels like the game isn't giving us enough time to adequately explore before it just auto-reveals stuff.  You certainly don't get much of a chance - or choice.

Just finished a weekend blitz of Season 2. I was worried that there was no way it could live up to the high bar set by Season 1, but it did not disappoint. This was a blast! I'm even considering setting a reminder to buy again in a year to give it another play through.

RATING: 10
The mechanics of the game are just different enough from Pandemic or Pandemic Legacy: Season 1 that this game feels fresh and exciting, while the familiar strategies and challenges are present.  Although the way that new parts of the game are revealed is similar to Season 1, there are some very fun additions.  As you might expect from a Pandemic game, there is a constant sense of tension and the challenges are very real, though surmountable with care. If they could keep this up, I would play Pandemic Legacy Seasons 3 through 1,000!

First of all, Pandemic was always one of my favourite games. Until I played first legacy season. Continuous changing of rules, hundreds of new rules and almost no consistency made me dislike the game. It became torture.
Second season managed to top this by defying every possible logic. It actively demoralizes players and managed to make me dislike Pandemic altohether. Thanks guys, for ruining it all!

The sequel to the #1 game on BGG has a lot to live up to. The game itself is great. The inversion of the cube disease Pandemic mechanic works well, and the world exploration is amazing. The difficulty seems a bit less balanced than S1 (many reports of too easy AND too hard). It is hard to tell if that is because of the change in mechanics or the difficulty balancing with how different each group will discover their maps (or both?). Still, an impressive feat, that sticks with you, and is worth playing.

Not as much as Pandemic: Season 1, but we are enjoying it very much. It is faster, and we plowed through several months in a couple weeks. Then Gloomhaven came and...it got cleaned up to make way.

RATING: 3
Let's be honest here, this game has great ideas but suffers from one major flaw - it is WAY too hard.  We played through S1 and were able to keep our funding level at 2-4, a fun win/loss ratio.  In this game we have played 3 months and lost 5/6 games.  This is not fun, and the game introduces way too much to screw you over and you can't recover.  I'm not having fun, my group is not having fun, we are done.  What a disappointment.

As of 11/11/17 we've played nine total games. 
Prologue: 2 plays, both wins
January: Win
February: Win
March: Win
April: Loss/Loss
May: Loss/Loss

Getting the feeling that there's no choices that actually affect the story (also realizing that that was true with Season 1). The most important things and major mechanics will get revealed whether you win or lose. The game has been very punishing with a bland, forgettable story so far. The fact that you can get a plague cube DURING SET UP is one of the worst mechanisms I've ever seen in a game. I do want a challenge but I also don't think getting demoralized right off the bat is fun in the slightest. Makes me not want to even waste my time. We crushed the first season in four days, season 2 is going to get shelved after these nine plays and we'll see if we ever finish it. Not sure that Legacy games are for me after all.

Overall, it's a great experience.
+ Improves on the legacy system in Season 1.
+ Flips the Pandemic system so that it's familiar, but feels very different.
+ Introduces some great exploration gameplay.

∆ There's a lull for a few months where the game could have a little more going on.

WOW!!! What can I say .... It's like in the movies. The sequel in the history of cinema is never better than the first one .... with only one exception - Terminator 2! Well this game is with the same exception ... it's better than the first one! I didn't expected this and was sceptic .... but i was wrong. Great fun playing it, great surprises through the game .... WOW!!! Now i can't see how they can make this game better if there is Season 3!!! But finger crossed ;)

Loved how they pushed the boundaries on legacy play. Each game was exciting and there was (for the most part) a natural progession in the story. Some games are much more time consuming than advertised, and I didn’t love how they had some forced stops to your progression.

UPDATE: I play this with the same (3 player) group as season 1.

- Session 1: 2 plays
- Session 2: 5 plays
- Session 3: 4 plays

We doing game nights where we're only playing this game. It's the bingewatching version of a board game. Very fascinating how it grabs us.

========== ========== ========== ========== ==========

And so we played 5 games of Pandemic Legacy Season 2 last night (February -> May). Season 1 was one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had, so the expectations were high. And to my own surprise Season 2 again blows me away. Why? A combination of a continuous story and game play that is different than classic Pandemic.

Try to forget how to play classic Pandemic otherwise you'll make mistakes that will cost you wins. Last night we lost 3 consecutive games which we've never had in Season 1. And part was because we made basic mistakes because we were assuming thing. And that's what I like, the game keeps you on your toes.

Story wise there is a nice arc build up and I'm looking forward how it will unfold. This is binge watching in a board game.

I said about PL:S1, that it was the finest boardgame ever contrived and this is number two. New and fresh mechanics, all the nice balance and clearly a lot of work in play testing. There were a couple times where we felt a bit stuck in this one, but it still gets 10 stars from me. Can't say enough nice things about this opus of game design.

Started off being more interesting than Season 1 with the way the game mechanics varied pretty substantially from the normal Pandemic. However things then started to get too chaotic and too luck based. The amount of rules and stipulations and exceptions to those rules just kept growing and growing and growing and you're guaranteed to mess them up in every game.

The game really sank for me right near the end when we discovered we needed to take the cure to the Jade lab, but yet hadn't discovered that. But wait! The objective says take the cure to Johannesburg and says nothing about the Jade lab. So we have two things telling us to take the cure to two places (which end up being the same), but no idea at the time as to if we can just ignore the objective and not bother with the Jade lab or if we need the Jade lab to complete the objective because of what another card said.

Overall the legacy aspect of this game just felt a lot sloppier which is a shame because there were some cool new mechanics and it was awesome that you got to explore the map rather than it just being there the entire time. So I enjoyed the experience, but I don't know if I'd want to play this again because of the lackluster ending.

For us, Season 2 was a big improvement on Season 1 (and we really liked Season 1). We really liked Season 1, but by the time the end of the game rolled around, we felt like it ended at a good place for us. Season 2 kept us on the edge of our seats until the very end. 

Below is a list of comparisons between Season 1 and Season 2 as well as our final score of the game. There are no content spoilers, but I'm enclosing it in spoiler brackets just in case people don't want to see it:
Putting my comments in a spoiler tag just in case some people may not want to see them (don't worry, though, no spoilers on content, just general feelings about overarching concepts):
[o]1) Mechanically, Season 1 is much more like classic Pandemic. Since classic Pandemic is a game that we enjoy, but don't love, it makes a sort of sense that we are enjoying Season 2 more. If classic Pandemic is one of your favorite games, I can see liking Season 1 more (though not necessarily).
2) In Season 2, I feel like players have more agency and can set their own goals. In Season 1, I felt like players were more often reacting to things that had happened and often couldn't really control the order that pretty much anything happened in the game (it struck me as very linear). In Season 2, there are goals on the board that players can decide when they want to pursue. Sometimes those goals may require that other things will have to be done first (sorry, this is a little vague to avoid getting into details), but that's a conscious decision that the players can make.
3) Season 2 is all about exploration and discovery. I'm excited to discover more areas of the map and get to new places we haven't been before. While I was excited to find out what happened next in Season 1, I never really got this same sense of discovery and world exploration.
4) I love how Season 2 has an XP system where players have several ways they can choose to upgrade characters, cards, or the world. This makes the end-game step feel very strategic. I would really miss this if I went back to play Season 1.
5) Games in Season 2 take longer and longer as the year goes on (at least, in our games) while in Season 1, I remember our games being more or less the same length (maybe a little longer in the later months?). As the year goes on in Season 2, you'll find yourself having to make tougher and tougher choices, often ones where you'll want to consult with your teammate(s). But I love every minute of it. It makes the game feel more strategic and I'm super immersed and invested.
6) Despite how much I've loved how Season 2 has evolved mechanically, I'm a little disappointed by how the story is implemented. I don't mean plot, I mean core writing mechanics. I feel like Season 1 was better written and better integrated into the mechanics of the game. Season 2's story feels a bit disjointed from the game (but again, maybe this is because of the poorer writing). 
7) I've seen some people talking about the price difference between seasons (in USD, the MSRP is $10 more for Season 2). Based on the components in the box, this honestly feels fair to me. There's so much packed in there.

Saving to play over Christmas break

Played the prolgue a few times and found it pretty uninspiring, I'd much rather play a regualr game of Pandemic. I hope the game picks up a bit once we start the Legacy aspect.

Now we're into to it the game is proving to be quite a bit of fun. There is a lot to think about and even when you lose you can take heart in the improvements in infrastructure that remain on the board.

Having finished the second season I can say I ended up enjoying it more than the first, it was a good time. I'm glad we played it during the holiday so we could keep on top of all the rules.

We finished in 17 games (3 goes at the prologue) with a win and score of 800.

What a great twist on the Pandemic mechanics!  Picking up and delivering "healing" instead of automatically being able to make a city you land in better is a great new mechanic to deal with.  The story elements and changing board make playing through this adventure a great experience.  I don't know if this will change your mind if you just don't care for the Pandemic cooperative experience in the first place, but I'm excited to see where this adventure goes!

About half way through the campaign so rating is bound to change.  The mechanics for this I still enjoy more than Season 1 so far.  However the surprises have been lacking and pretty boring to this point.  Oh and I never thought I'd say this about a game ever, but I could use a little more exciting story line similar to Season 1. I know it is sure to get more exciting, but they sure are making you wait for it this time.  Not something I would usually look for in a game, but it is what Pandemic Legacy is built around so it needs to step it up. Without the story for why, the mechanic changes that happen are pretty weak compared to something like Risk Legacy or Seafall.  My rating will definitely drop more if it continues like this through out the campaign.

It's still Pandemic, but with a significant twist in the main mechanic. It's worth playing the prologue game a few times to wrap your head around the new heuristics. Enjoyed the first reveal, looking forward to more.

I like the new artwork, it's got a Mad Max feel. The post-apocalyptic setting is also more engaging than the original one.

UPDATE: (After finishing the full game.) Although it's quite hard right at the beginning, once we got a few more powers we had a handle on it. Then it got hard again mid-year as we focused more on certain game goals rather than winning. But by the end we had super-powered characters and thanks to game changes it was mostly a breeze again. We played almost entirely with 3 characters. Had we lost one of them at any point it would have been a disaster rebuilding the team.

I enjoyed the story/art/setting, and liked the narrative that our decisions and emotional attachments created. The exploration aspect and then other goals kept us interested, and I enjoyed the special game mechanics more than in the first season. I would say there weren't really big surprises, and the game plays it safe in terms of what it attempts and how it needs to keep the players on track. I would like to play a legacy board game one day that makes me really go "woah" at how it develops.

Good to great game. Biggest problem is it has to live up to the fading memories from season 1. The new mechanics are good but often they are there to entertain the legacy aspects. A more complete game to start with might have been better. Ballancing was no problem in our case.
If you loved season 1 you will at least like season 2. If you like legacy games for the sake of opening boxes you will love season 2. If you didn't like season 1 and legacy games better stay away.

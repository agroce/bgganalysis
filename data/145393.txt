RATING: 5
This one is a bit of a conundrum. Simple, short and fun. But the components just aren't quite up to par, even by Victory Point standards. The cards were warped as soon as the box opened and the little dwarf miner standees do not hold together for play. In addition to that there are certain combinations of room cards that would allow a player just to move back and forth between two rooms getting points enabling them to win without having to explore any further. That breaks a game in my opinion but at least it does not come up often.

RATING: 8.2
A very nice game, it felt more like a solo game, and the ultralight mechanic is not analogous to the depth. 
This really could have been an even bigger production, there is potential in the simple 2 gems per card mechanic.
I am thinking that if the cost for a room was proportionate to the room's ability (instead of random), the game would climb very high.

I really wanted to like this more, and after reading the rules and watching a play-through, I thought I would. Love the artwork, love the set collection and exploration aspect of the map. 

Unfortunately, a few flaws prevent me from loving the game. Several room abilities require you to cycle through the deck, drawing cards until you find what you need, which gets tedious after a while. Reshuffling over and over also is a pain. But mainly, I hated how you might get stuck for several turns in a bad sector of the tunnel, and end up using one room over and over until you finally get what you need. It makes what should be a mildly tactical, fun exploration game into a glorified version of Go Fish.

A fun tile layer with an added card driven mechanic. It's light but puzzly. Not much interaction solo or competitive. I feel like I have other tile laying games that I enjoy more. Traded.

A game of collecting gems from a card stack and opening doors in cave tiles with these gem cards, and by opening the door the cave expands. The game is very luck-driven and a little long given the limited options it offers.

Simple game with a tacked on theme. Every turn you hope to get combinations of cards to match requirements on the map... and you probably won't. For as small and simple as it is, it's also too difficult. Or un-fun. Or something's missing. You don't feel like you're getting anything done, and even if you lose, sometimes end game can be a relief. Tiny text and icons on the tiles doesn't help much.

Meh, it's okay. Like Saboteur minus the co-op play, and a lot of the take that. Set collecting is fine but not thrilled about the randomness of the draw and the seemingly wide gap in room tile powers. I don't hate this but i won't necessarily suggest it

Not a bad little filler. Played coop mode only so far. It is pretty difficult, but the balance between luck and planning is there. You never feel as if circumstances are entirely out of your control. Winning must be hard earned, it can be unforgiving if you have a few bad turns in a row.
I'll add that the card art is terrific, and was a big draw to me (pun intended). However the artwork on the cave tiles, while certainly quality, does not allow for easily distinguishing different rooms. It would be nice to glance at the map and - without having to read the room texts -  easily see where the Chaos Fountain and Electrum Tunnels and Volcanic Well etc are. Instead you have to rely some on memory of placement, and reread things frequently.

 Nice that the game has the ability to be played co-op or competitive as it is short enough to teach it co-op and then play it again competitive. My family likes this one. A lot of replayability with the different room tiles.

RATING: 6
Probably best with 2?  Not a lot going on to justify how long other folks' turns can take.  Also, icons/colors are a little tough for colorblind people (the gems on the map tiles are just too darn small.)

RATING: 4
Decent game, good solo. However, fairly luck dependent based on what rooms get pulled for your mine. Given how often I get to play solo (not a ton), there are better solo games out there. And along those same lines, there are other similar quick playing multiplayer games that I'd rater get to the table than this one.

Exploring mines is easy at first, but finding new passages to explore becomes harder as the cave network expands. A decent game when played solo, though hard to be efficient enough to score points at the requisite rate.

[u]10-Sep-2016[/u]:  Gem Rush is a light, fun, family level tile-layer.  At its heart, it's a set collection game...get the right combo of colors to add another tile to the map.  And this also scores you points.   The game can be played solo, co-op, or competitive.  Each turn, you have three movement points to use.  Whatever tile you end your turn, you may use that location's special action...usually drawing more cards.  And that's it, really.

It doesn't have a lot of decisions, but the combination of set collection, easygoing gameplay, and building the mine (a favorite mechanism of mine) creates just a simple, fun game for me.  Adding in the mini-expansion, the Skill Cards, adds starting player powers for some variety and additional card manipulation.  Good stuff!

Not so sure about this.  The decisions don't seem to interesting, and there seems to be a lot of luck involved in winning.  Ok for a quick diversion, but I'd rather play other stuff, to be honest.

Quite a pleasant little game for a quick, stress-free solo time. The multiplayer is fun but may be balanced to a fault. Though there are a couple different strategies and tactics you can use: camp a good tile and then bomb the big-VP spaces, or sprint around, use the special moves and hit the 1-2 pointers. The components are fantastic for a little indie company--very impressed.

Discovered the co-op works really well with kids, because it feels really tense at the end, even with a surefire victory.

Fun little game.  I enjoy creating the mine maze with the square cards.  Choosing from all the actions printed on the mine cards is what makes the game a lot of fun.  There are some fun ways to obtain cards.  A 2-player game can be played pretty quick.  Also makes a fun solitaire game!

Interesting little game. I wasn't initially sold on it after opening the box and reading the rules, but it's actually kinda fun. The competitive mode is fun and I could see it being interesting with 6 dwarves running all over the mine, it might bog down a bit, but I think the turns are quick enough that it wouldn't be too bad. 

I also like the solo/co-op play. It gets intense with needing to have the right gems and the deck burning out quickly. I think 2 players might be ideal for that version.

A great little game that is quite easy to pick up and play.  Sure, there is luck of the draw, but the choices you make also matter.  And digging or opting for particular gems at a particular time can affect your path and ability to move on.  A simple ruleset and gameplay that is quite a bit of fun.

The packaging is ATROCIOUS. I am not likely to buy another game from this publisher again. Literally the same cardboard material and design as a pizza box and then you have to slide it into a paper sleeve that will RIP. AWFUL.

RATING: 4
Quick, and works with anywhere between 2-6 players. You get these little makers, and pay gems from your hand to open up new passage ways, and when you do you score some points printed on that tile. The game has two modes, co-op where you are collectively trying to get to a certain score, and vs mode where it's just first to 20 ends the game (and then most points wins at the end of that round).

The tiles should be thicker, or at least sleevable. They are printed on thin card-stock, and even though they are square, they are the wrong size for the Fantasy Flight Supply square sleeves. After many plays, I've gotten pretty tired of this game. There are too many turns where you just don't have an interesting choice to make.

Ok if playing with more than one character. 
When playing solo it is entirely possible to find yourself in a situation where you cannot do very much. It certainly doesn't happen in every game, but when it does it is rather frustrating. So when I play it, which isn't often, I prefer to solo a two-player game.

RATING: 7
The game has a weird way about it where you want to be near other players to benefit from them opening rooms (and thus spending cards so you don't have to), but also far from them so you can get victory points by opening rooms uncontested. A decent amount of the rooms are based on RNG (e.g. "draw the top 5 cards and take any with "), but it turns into a gambling scene rather than a necessary part of the game since you can always move around. The biggest downside comes from needing specific gems to open rooms, because sometimes the luck mitigation from room abilities just isn't enough and you can't find the right gem. Otherwise a solid game.

A very simple little tile-laying (card-laying) game that plays out quite differently every time. It fits most play counts well, though my preference is with 2 or 3.

I had minimal control over the game's events and outcome, which is why I'm pleading 'insane and pleased with myself' to the charge of setting my opponent's mullet on fire once he was clearly winning.  Business in the front, arson in the back...

As per reading the rules all i can think of is a nice fast filler. Great design and theme and variability that comes from array of unique room abilities that will ensure re-playability. Reminds me of Ticket to ride but with more twists. Like the fact that there are competitive and coop versions and it's solo compatible. Overall Great Value. Ordered. Score went to 8 after first play. :) Luck is a factor but there's lots of planning ahead and thinking apart from it. Recommended for what it is. Only tried solo. I feel it lacks some player interaction which "Saboteur" card game has and this one may benefit from similar system - Dirty tricks in competitive mode and support options in coop, also different colored dwarves may have gem specializations or skills of some sort in an expansion for example, also new original special movement rooms will be much appreciated. :)

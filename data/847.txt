My grandmother gave me this game before her passing. I never really play it but I loved pulling it out as a kid and playing my only little army games in my head. The actual game is very similar to chess but with a tactical terrain feel. Keep it mostly for nostalgia and because the box storage is great.

Very interesting game with a very uninteresting board. It uses the plastic peg board from a few other games by Avalon/Victory/whatever, using green squares for mountains and green lines for forests. Other than that, this is sort of like a chess-meets-tabletop-wargaming mashup that works quite well, and supports up to four players. I quite enjoy it.

Piece movement is similar to chess but (unlike chess) the pieces do not start in fixed positions on the board.  Their are six colored armies allowing for more than two players. Must capture your opponents castle or kill all his royalty pieces to win.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This game plays like an older game that was ahead of its time.  It has a dated feel to it, but you can see the influence it *could have had* on newer games.  But the truth is the game is newer than the mechanics and play would lead you to believe.  Game play will depend on the interaction of and with the other players.  This can break down if one player is particularly weak in contrast to a neighbor.  Thus the loser will find the game frustrating, the winner will see it as a testament to their play and the 2nd / 3rd players will be left wondering where they missed out on the game.

Pretty meh...I get what they were trying to do and applaud the attempt but the results are basically not good, at least as the rules read.

The game is fine and an interesting attempt at multiplayer chess, but there is potential for a "ganging up" mechanic that simply can't be countered if it happens to you and if you're knocked out early you're stuck watching for an open ended amount of time.

I have fond memories of playing this game during the summers in high school.  My friend and I couldn't seem to get enough.  When I renewed my gaming addiction, I knew I had to have my own copy of this offering.  Picked up a copy as part of a lot from ebay.  Of course, just weeks later I found a complete version in a thrift store for 1/5 of the price.  Gifted it to my buddy with whom I created the memories.  My boys love it for the "guys", so gave them an imcomplete copy I discovered at a thrift store.  It still looks grand, and I enjoy an occasional play, but time moves on, and the joys of the past dissolve under the loves of today and the expectations of the future.  Who knew Feudal would get me to wax philosophical?  [$5.00 as part of ebay lot]

RATING: N/A
See image id 998942 for a photo of what the 1969 version looks like.  The box shows some shelf wear, especially along the top edge, but is solid and performs it's job well.  The game is all there:  A complete and neat rule set, four screen holders and the screen, four clips to hold the board together, a board that looks to be unplayed, and all the figures.  I'm going to assume that either this game was either unplayed, or if it was, only a couple of the colors were used, as I had to trim some odds and ends of sprues from some of the figures.  If I had not, then they would not have fit in the holes on the board.  In other words, the game in the box is in great shape.  A great players copy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Nice box with minor shelf wear.  Board is complete with original rule set.  Four divider holders are in the box insert.  Game can be played, but only two player as the only pieces that are included are all the dark brown and all the dark turquoise pieces.  The rest of the pieces are AWOL.

Dropped my rating as I gave it a 5 to be nice. Too much 'panzerskulking' and very little to do with proper tactics. Played it lots as a kid as there was nothing else out there (to my knowledge) in the late '70s. 

Needs heaps of work to be made into a proper game for this day and age.

A fun variant of chess from the 60's. Instead of moving one piece at a time you move your entire force or as few as you want. Which opens up battlefield and formation like strategies. Capture your opponents royalty or their castle to win. Also includes terrain to the strategy of movement. Made by the 3M Company in St.Paul, Minnesota! This vintage game is not easy to find!

Chess with more pieces and more downtime.  The initial setup is key - if you're moving second and set your guys up where they can be attacked, you're screwed.  It's somewhat interesting and maybe team play would be cool, but I can't see anyone really wanting to play this.

Chess with a total mindset change; each player can move all their pieces on their turn so it leads to a lot of change each turn and a whole different way of looking ahead.  Having not played it too much, I am concerned it might not be very deep, but we shall see!

RATING: 6
This is a very interesting little game, seems ahead of its time in one way but a throw back in other ways.  The different abilities of the units make it seem like a newer minnies-type of game, while the board and the type of strategy (almost chess-like) make it seem old.  
Can bring on a feeling of "What do I do?" as you stare at the board.

I like:  the modular aspect of the playing field, the changing conditions from turn to turn, the possible tactics and the blind setting up of the starting positions.

It's not a wargame, it's not  a society game.

RATING: 9
Bought when it first came out. Excellent cross of chess and war games - everything (supply, terrain, combat and movement factors, combat resolution, and unit capability) is abstracted into piece movement or squares. Highways exist, zones of control exist - and no clatter of dice or constant stopping to look at rules and tables.

RATING: 7.25
I think this is a great little game.   It could have been better if you could randomnly place mountains and rough.  It's like chess but you can move all of your pieces on a turn.  I lost my first game because of linear thinking; I missed considering that a sequence of moves on a turn could nullify worthwhile retaliation.  Exchanging pieces can be difficult.

Feudal is a contest between two armies made of infantry and cavalry pieces with variable, restricted, chess-like moves. Four geo-morphic boards can be arranged to create a variety of battlefields, and terrain includes mountains and rough terrain.  Opponents claim victory by either capturing the enemy's castle or eliminating his three royal pieces: King, Prince, and Duke. An abstract classic from Avalon Hill.

RATING: 9
Rating for nostalgia.

A chess variant that plays more like miniatures, with asymmetrical terrain, blind set-up, and ability to move all pieces. There are additional movement capabilities for some of the pieces, such as pikemen that move like rooks, but also with a single diagonal move, or sergeants that move like bishops, but also with a single horizontal/vertical move. There are also a larger number and variety of units, like four knights (two being royalty) that move like queens, and an archer, which can kill a unit at a distance.

Since there are six armies, players can control up to three armies each for a bloodfest to adjust complexity and/or playing time. Alternatively, four or six players can control one or two armies for multi-player elimination or cooperative team play. Several sets could be pieced together for even larger scale battles.

This was great fun when I first bought it in the late 70's, but quickly tired of it due to lack of capable opponents. The game has a large learning curve, much like chess, and requires careful study to play well. Match-ups between veterans and beginners will be lopsided.

I would consider this one of the great "classic" abstracts to come out in the 20th century, along side Stratego, where both have strong military themes. Twixt is another classic that shares a common 3M heritage.

I played this as a kid. I think I liked it, but apparently not enough for it to be memorable.  What I remember most is looking for places where I could put a castle that had no approaches longer than three spaces, so that I could put my archer on the courtyard and feel safe.

The problem here I think is it allows you to move ALL of your men if you want, that is just WAY too open, way too much analysis possible, downtime, etc, etc, 

Its cool though, a kind of abstract chess-type wargame, it also seems whoever goes first has a big advantage but I have not played enough to know that for sure.  It does seem houserules are popular for this though…

A great alternative to chess.  I thought this game was great until I came across 3-D chess--chess played on a 3 level chess board with extra pieces (one being a Cannon & another being a Unicorn).

Very much like Chess, only you move all of your pieces at once. You have to be in a very...tactical mood to play this game. It's essentially an effort of memory as you watch each of your opponent's moves one by one and remember to move your units out of harm's way as a result. Eventually one person or the other screws up, it's immediately obvious they screwed up, they feel like an idiot, and then the whole process starts over. It's possible I might choose this over Chess for its multiplayer capabilities, but I am almost never in the mood for Chess so...

It is rumored that the first editions had metal pieces. I have yet to see this though. Such a copy would command a thousand dollar price tag.

I wouldn't want to play it today, but as a kid, it was a blast.  I remember games going on for a long time, which didn't seem like that big of a problem at the time.

Purchased this due to my girlfriends nostalgia for playing with her father's copy when she was a kid.  The appearance is nice ("leatherette" bookshelf game) but the game itself is pretty much a chess variant.  I'm no fan of chess, so that's strike one.  Strike two is chess related...if you have little interest in the game to start with, you're not likely to go through the trouble to master the strategies that you'll need to make it interesting.  Still, it's a nice relic from a bygone era.

A funny and strategically chess-like game. Original concept where some squares represent different kind of terrain: rough, clear and swamp. You can play with 1 to 3 armies but always with only one king, one prince and one duke, each of them being leader of an army. This game can be played by 2 to 6 players. Despite moves are made like in chess, it also has an interesting feel of a light medieval wargame.

I already dislike chess already, so when introduced to 2-6 player chess I was skeptical. Turns out I was right, at least for my taste. Without a severe limit on the length of one's turn the downtime and length of the game is super long. I can see how many people could dig that, but its just not my  bag. The only reason it gets a three and not two is beause of the really finely crafted pieces, especially for 1967.

Interesting, ornate game with chess as an obvious point of departure, Feudal suffers a bit when compared to it if played only with one army per player: the board is enormous for the amount of pieces on it, the terrains seem to be distributed without much of a criterion and there's no irreversible move (like pawns in chess going only forward). This can all lead to endless groping before a right attack is mounted (moving all players at once brings to mind the looming shadow of analysis paralysis as well). 

The game grows its own flavour when played with two or three armies each (the more the better), even though there's still danger of long thinking pauses the amount of pieces leads to interesting movements in blocks and piece exchanges (more carnage!) to tilt the game towards one player or the other. At this point, the game can get deep, vicious and thus very gripping.

Treading on the muddy waters between wargaming and abstracts, Feudal feels a bit unfinished -but a good round of it can be glorious.

The coolest thing about Feudal: blind set up.  You have some real choices to make about how you intend to play the game.  Do you create a defensive set up?  Do you go all out offensive?  Concentrate forces?  Disperse them?  I think it's easy to dismiss this game, but there is some substance here if you spend time with the game.

For me was a chess-upgrade in the 1970's, as there were only a few other games my dad's collection, so it got played a lot because it's what we had. Love and loved the pieces, and the hidden set-up was sweet. Ultimately, a chess variant. Game boils down to 'not seeing a move', you or your opponent. If this happens to you in chess or Feudal, you lose.

I was introduced to this at a very early age.  The bits blew me away.  Loved the blind set up also.  Game dynamics are not that challenging - my brother calls it "whoever goes first wins".  Back when I was eight years old I would have rated this a 9, but there's so much better that I rather play

RATING: 7
One play, two players, lost horribly

Chess variant, minus the pawns. Huge downtime issues since you can move any and all pieces. However, this is mitigated by the fact that [a] you simply have to occupy a space (the castle) on the board, not checkmate a piece, and [b] I think less tactical richness than chess.

It's really hard to create clever, sacrificial plays to capture your opponent's pieces since your opponent can move any and all pieces during his turn. So it seems harder to make even piece exchanges. Also, it seems that making risky, open attacks against your opponent isn't usually a good idea. It's better to take it slow and easy and wait for your opponent to screw up tactically. 

Bonus points for all plastic components, including board! Moulded plastic figures that fit on a peg board (which suspiciously looks like a Twixt board) is always good!

I like this game a lot. But then again, I'm also a chess nut so this game is right up my alley. Like other great strategy games, there is no luck involved in Feudal so if you lose you can only blame yourself. I enjoy the feel of "chess on a map" and the mind-bending aspect of having to think of the moves for all your pieces and the future moves for all of your opponent's pieces before you actually move a single piece. I have only played this as a two player game and would love to see how multiple players changes the feel of the game.

This game looks impressive when it's all set up, but the gameplay leaves a bit to be desired.  With the massive movement allowances (even the pawn equivalents can get halfway across the board in one turn) and the ability to move all the pieces every turn, you end up with a massive free-for-all at the start, then after all the offensive pieces annihilate one another, you're left with defensive pieces unable to mount any attack at all.

I am somewhat biased with this game, as I have fond memories of it, and it also was the impetus of my board game maturity (along with Mall Of Horror) from the basic Walmart stock.  It plays well, it's very in depth and it has nothing to do with luck.  The only problem I've found is the 2 or more army "two archers protecting the castle" defense (which I employ more often than I face).

Actually NOT a chess variant as some people think.
The fact, that you can move ALL your pieces instead of just ONE alone makes this one VERY different from Chess. For example, you cannot "cover" your pieces like in Chess, because the opponent can do much more than just take a single piece.
Feels more like a wargame on a Twixt board.

I remember making some of my own modifications to this game to make it play differently.  You didn't just take the opposing piece like in chess, you "engaged" it and then had to roll dice.

Old multi-player abstract from Avalon Hill.  Can be fun.  Components are a bit annoying.

House Rules only. Different rules each time we play.

It's a light chess take off that has a variety of pieces which move in many ways like chess, and other ways not like chess. The game becomes one of attrition very quickly and plays out down to the last piece pretty much in that manner when two players are equally matched.

Unless you have a few folk that like this a lot though, the replay quality just isn't there for this game and if it doesn't grow on you, it will fade into the dust gathering place.

Thrifted a pretty ragged copy.  Missing some pieces, but hopefully will find another copy or partial to make a better final version.

I'd always wanted to see Chess where all pieces could move each turn and there was terrain: this provides that.

The rules are a photocopy, and the box has some shelf wear.

As a chess-like game, this simply doesn't work well; based on reviews and comments, I'm hoping an alternate miniatures-like approach can salvage it but I'm not sure what that means or how it would work.

Played again and not yet sure what I think.

This may have been the very first Avalon Hill bookcase game I ever purchased. I was maybe 13 at the time. 1980?

Update: I have since purchased a 3rd set. It's the same as one of the other 2.
Update: my previous entry indicated that my 1st edition was short some pieces. Upon obtaining a 2nd set I discovered that it was missing the exact same pieces. Upon inquiry from fellow 3M'ers, I found that they also were missing the same pieces. The later editions had full compliments of pieces.

***I'm still looking for more of the early versions bc the 2 that I have some variations between them. So I'm looking to see if there's any more variants.

Fond memories in my youth, but not so fond when recently played. A soon as the other guy screws up and loses just two pieces, you can attrit to a 'last man standing' win.

I'm not a big fan of Chess.  This is an improvement on chess and the pieces are wonderful.  Ultimately though it is a new twist on chess and I'm not a chess fan.

I enjoy some elements of this game, but ultimately a broken and somewhat tedious exercise. Would rather play chess.

This was my first wargame as a kid.  It's not bad, but doesn't stand the test of time as well as other games from my youth.  My rating indicates the soft spot I have for it.

There are so many better games now. And rules may not be broken - but questionable

Catch Phrase is a pretty fun party game; it's a million times better than Taboo and the like, in any case. The electronic version is nice and convenient.

Played at a library board game night.  Not one of my favorite games, but then, I'm not fond of annoying beeps and stressful timers.  I did guess a number of words/phrases correctly, and gave some pretty good hints, but this is not a game I'd otherwise play.

The electronic versions have a lot more double words to guess rather than the more common single words on the original manual version. Which slows the game down a bit. It's still fun but I prefer the original version. A fun party game with 4 people or 20 people, playing individually or in groups, keeping score or just playing for fun. Start with just a couple of people and let other people jump in. Fun and versatile.

Always good at parties, I love the fast-paced nature of it. The passing mechanism is always screwy when you're trying to play in a circle and alternate teams, but can be worked around if everybody's actually interested in playing. Also works great in the car to pass time if the passengers are giving clues to the driver.

This version has "lesbians", which is the standard answer to give on a steal attempt when not enough information has been given.  Some day it will actually work!  In the meantime, we still occasionally use this set instead of the other because of the pleasant "and wins!" sounds.

RATING: 6.5
Players divide into 2 teams and are seated alternately.  The player with the game device looks at the answer it is showing and gives verbal clues to his/her teammates without using any part of the actual answer.  Once an answer is guessed correctly, the device is passed on to the next player.  All the while, the device gives off a warning beep whose tempo is increasing until it buzzes to a stop.  The team opposite of the one that ends up with the device when the timer stops scores a point.  

This game is fun and hectic and makes for some outrageous guesses especially when the timer is going off.  The device is like a trivia hot potato and no one wants to hold it.  If you enjoy word association, trivia, and some harmless stress, I'd recommend this game.

Played many many times with wide ranges of player counts. I find that this game almost always goes over well with people and it is found to be enjoyable. I always play on variety which can give somewhat obscure names of people. We play with a 1-skip rule and sometimes extra skip for people in order to overcome this. I think the game is a perfect length and people usually want to play again as a rematch. Have used the many times in bible studies and other groups and it has gone over well almost every time.

I love love love me some catch phrase! but the electronic one just isnt as fun, im sorry its just not.  I love the old school one with the cards, the classic slap and toss. ooh, how many times has that thing fell onto the floor with the cards spilling everywhere!! **memories** this one is just confusing, if you hit the wrong button the timer starts over, it can be hard to read if in the wrong light. Still, I cant knock it too much...seriously though, if you are reading this, get the paper version!!

Crazy fun for any group, especially a group that just can't stomach learning meatier games and just wants a brain-off party game. It can even get physically dangerous at times, when people try to fling the Catch Phrase machine like a discus.

RATING: 6
In this 2-team party game, players will pass around a plastic circle that gives clues they need their team to guess. Using words, sounds, gestures, etc, a player will try to get his team to say the clue. The electronic version is much better than the old one, eliminating the need to change cards (especially mid-round) and the completely unnecessary board.

There is not as much room for creativity as the Apples to Apples type of party game. Even in its genre, it requires a lot less thoughtfulness than Taboo. Skill is downplayed because of the very random "hot potato" mechanism. If it scored like Taboo (points for how many you get right, rather than "other team gets a point if you have it when time runs out") it would reward player more appropriately. As it stands, it can't really be played super-competitively.  However, the freedom to give clues with hand motions, sound effects, and virtually anything else that most other games restrict is a plus.

The time pressure does create funny situations and players will find themselves laughing as they struggle to come up with clues while time winds down. Given its portability and accessibility, it's worth keeping around as party games go, but it's not the best of the bunch by a long shot.

This is a re-implementation of the classic team word-guessing hot-potato game Catch Phrase! but all electronic. Players divide into two teams. One team selects the category and presses the start button. An audible timer beeps a count-down while the person holding the device tries to get his team to say the word or phrase on the screen. When he or she is successful, he or she hands the device to the next person on the opposite team. The goal of the round is to not be holding the device when the timer goes off -- though those last furtive seconds can get dicey! When the timer goes off, the opposing team gets a point and (based on what version of the game you are playing) may also have a chance to steal the phrase for an extra point. The first team to reach seven points wins!

RATING: 9
A really nice party game for medium sized groups. Works well with 6-10, and I've even played it in a group of 20. The basic idea is a classic one: Describe a word (or a place or a concept) so your teammates can guess the word. The part that makes it fun is the fact that the timer is counting down while you play and it will randomly go off. If you're caught holding the device, your team loses a point. Because of the hot-potato element, there's pressure to get it right quickly, and strategy for handing it off. We play this at a lot of family gatherings - and while we're insanely verbal, my kids have been able to play along well since about age 6 or 7.

Like "password" - Similar to Taboo? Get team to guess a word by giving clues. Pass to other team. When buzzer goes off, team NOT holding device gets a point, and gets an extra point if they can guess the current word - Play to 7.

A long tradition of playing this at New Year's Eve parties and the end of night game. The hot potato makes it funny and tense at the same time, it usually gets a laugh, though a roll of eyes from those who get annoyed when they keep getting answers they don't know (especially for us as non-US trying to clue US actors from the 70s).

great party/family game.

a simplified version of taboo.  I'm sure people like this more.

I'm a sucker for party games and Catch Phrase is a good one. However, it seems like after just a few games you will already start seeing some of the same words repeated-which is a shame. Therefore, I can only give this a "6" overall (the non-electronic I give an unplayable "2").

(100+ plays)  I have played this game countless times.  I am sure I have logged hundreds of games.  We have done multiple repeats of the word list on the second electronic edition, and we were really glad to see the newer red edition released for that reason.

This game is always full of laughs and a total blast.  I consider it to be the perfect party game.  You don't need any parts or scorepads.  You can sit or stand anywhere - living room, floor, campfire.  It has minimal downtime, and the turns are very fast.  Always a hit.

A slightly tolerable party game. I'd hopefully only play this while visiting family, and not often. My mom has this and I did have OK fun with it.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a great party activity and easy to pull out.  Just sit in a circle and press a button on the electronic device and you're off.

It is played by showing you a word or phrase that you have to get your team (every other player in the circle) to guess without saying the word/phrase or parts of the word/phrase then you pass it to the next person who is on the other team and has to do the same.  The device has a timer and starts to beep when it is getting close to the end and it plays a lot like Hot Potato, whoever has the device at the end of time earns the opposing team a point.

Everyone can play (we play that you have a 3 skip allowance per turn if you don't know the word/phrase) and it is a loud and exciting simple party "game".

MEDIUM TRADE PRIORITY - I'm willing to look at all reasonable offers for this. But I might not want to make a trade if I'm not 100% sure I want the item on offer or if shipping costs are significant.

RATING: 6
An OK Mystery Rummy game (the Jekyll/Hyde mechanic is interesting) but with weak theme, art %u2014 and poor card quality. Wyatt Earp is a much better Mystery Rummy game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Quick, not that great, but I like standard rummy ok, and this is more entertaining.  A standard card game + some little bits to spice it up.  "Transformation" card can be too good, maybe, in rare event one player gets it several hands.

Ok, after a couple of plays, I think clever card-play is possible but with good players this is a significantly more luck-dominated game than traditional rummy.  Waiting for a potion + the simplicity of deciding how to meld make it a weaker game in several respects.

The dual identity card provides an interesting twist to the usual Mystery Rummy mechanics. It's pretty easy to get stuck, which is a bit annoying. A fun one, though.

RATING: 6.8
Perhaps more than the other games, this one provides a more simplistic, streamlined introduction to the mechanics of the Mystery Rummy series. Perhaps play it first and then graduate on to Jack the Ripper or one of the others, though the differences in complexity are miniscule. Not my favorite of the lot, but the Hyde/Jeckyll Dual Identity mechanic and transformation cards work pretty well and fit the theme, and I do like the presentation.

An enjoyable game, and the only Mystery Rummy game still in print when we got into gaming in 2008. Sometimes the endgames become a card drawing contest to see who can find a layoff, but we still enjoy it. We play it off and on, but always come back to play it more.

RATING: 5
We decided to play it before naming the title will bring out our darker side. without the aid of a potion. My partner is preparing a reading-campaign on this Stevenson story, and in two months time we'll be heading for the nearest exit when anyone mentions the title.

Right now, it is still one of my favourite tales, and unfortunately that does mean sky-high hopes when a designer picks the setting. Even when everything else on the box oozes subtle warnings to temper my expectations back to family game design level, with pretty picture and the right names, I just cannot help myself and hope for something that usually doesn't bother me that much: that the game genuinely evokes some of the atmosphere that gripped me when I first read the book.

The added burden of thematic expectations is hugely unfair, as only a few settings have that effect one me. This is one of the games that gets scrutinized by me against more demanding standards. So far, with notable exceptions, my hopeful expectations usually create the sort of moat that few games can cross without getting any feet wet. And, with disappointment, I must admit that this one too, didn't quite make it safe to the other side without me jumping in and dragging it out, concluding it couldn't quite walk on water after all.

This is not a bad game. And the theme suits the mechanics very well. The rummy "twist", that only cards that match the current state of the doctor can be played as sets, is a superb variation on game that I have played to death when I was young. Special cards (potions) change this state, from Jekyll to Hyde and back. This is what makes the game genuinely interesting, and combined with the scoring rules, and shut-out conditions, it should invoke some intriguing game play. Drifting between states, with dark layers of complex card interactions, this could be a genuine Jekyll and Hyde experience indeed.

But what follows is a let-down. Calling a discard pile "London" is the sort of unimaginative thematic desperation I hate, and immediately ignore, but it does highlight how little room there was to flesh out the theme beyond the two sides of the "Identity Card". The card sets are functionally coloured, but that is it. I am sure they are aptly named, but it matters not, so I haven't even read them yet. You can call them "Case Cards " as much as you want, but where is the case to be made, the puzzle, the mystery? All atmosphere went, the moment I got my 10 hand cards, and all I was looking for was a 3rd orange with a "J" on it.

So what is left? A fairly decent, low-complexity game with a few great ideas, and for a certain audience, mostly kids and families, I can see this work really well. But anyone with a half-decent card collection and who is looking for a slightly more enduring challenge, will be able to put a game on the table that offers so much more to 2 players in the same amount of time.

What you do get is one great idea (divide the 10 sets in 3 types - Jekylls, Hydes, and neutral cards that match both - and allow these cards only to be played as sets if they match the state of the Doctor card). Throw in a few complications (stressing [i]few[/i]): special cards that alter the state of the Doctor, special cards that allow you to dig for better ones in the communal card pool, and one special card that can change the nature of one set of cards on your side of the table, or on the opponent's side (neat, but so overly powerful that whoever gets it is three quarters on the way to a complete shut down, or at worst, a guaranteed comparatively decent score for that hand, even if the opponent goes out first). The end score again uses the different states of the Doctor quite well, and it does tie it all together in a well-thought out solid game.

It is all way to simple for my taste. Clever combo play is just about non-existing. There are a few ways to get through the endgame well, using your wits, but it is still far too dependant on luck. Linear and obvious. There certainly are a few way to be dumb towards the end, but that is also easily avoided. Far too often it comes down to whoever is first to draw their last needed card from the draw-pile. That can't be right. It all kinda happily trodds on without few real challenges, and while people can be exactly in that frame of mind, I can't see how with the limited variety of cards, repeated play will ever offer new and intriguing challenges. Certainly not the riveting experience I was hoping for.

I have tried to understand all the good press it is getting here, even by folk who I know have played far more games than I have, but I just don't see it a a game with a lasting attraction. On the complexity scale, to me, it is in there somewhere with Top-Trumps and Happy Families, with a similar chance to become a master of deep strategy... in your dreams. And whoever put "suggested age 10+" on the box must have struggled through primary school.

It is the sort of game I would bring out as a light-hearted fast playing filler that needs little explanation, and probably only if I had someone much younger to entertain, who hasn't had much exposure to the rich world of games that are out there (yet). [i]Then[/i] I can see this work really well. Otherwise, why bother? It might be a half-decent 2-player Rummy variant, but for a game about duality, it is repetitively predictable and frustratingly one-dimensional.

The role flip puts this game slighter above Jack the Ripper, but still kind of ditto comment -- we kinda felt like we were just playing a variant of Rummy that really wasn't any better than just playing some rummy.

RATING: 6
Good game, but not great.  Very small footprint, so it's easy to play anywhere.  We've started playing three hands and keeping score as a differential, rather than first-to-100.

The black card edges mean that they might mark easily.  For the moment they're fine.  Cards are extremely stiff and hard to shuffle.

With the transformation from Jeckyl to Hyde tied into the melds you can play, it leads to some very tricky plays.

RATING: 7
Picked this up because Mystery Rummy: Jack the Ripper is one of my favorite games.  While Jekyll & Hyde is also a fun and thematic way to play rummy, the game feels less strategic.  I found myself blind drawing for a specific card somewhat often towards the end of each hand, and that doesn't seem to happen in JtR.  Thus, it might not be worth owning multiples of this series.

My problem with this game is the cards.  They are too thick and stiff, they don't shuffle worth a darn!  What were they thinking???  Other than that, it's an amusing rummy variant.  Quick play, light filler for 2 players.

I appreciate the fact that this series is so up front about what you are getting - rummy with a theme and some rule tweaking.  This is a fast enjoyable game.  Although it's very common for one person to score a shut-out, you never know who will win a round until it ends.

RATING: 5
Strong entry in the mystery rummy series.  Very transportable entertainment for two.  Light-hearted fun.  UPDATE:  Seems like there should be a way to mitigate the transformation card, but in many of the past few games it has been the deciding factor.  This version of mystery rummy has too many shut-outs for my liking.  Still interested in playing it, but a little frustrated.  Will probably pick up some other entries in the series to see if they're better (love Wyatt Earp, btw).

The first thing I noticed about this game is that the cards are extraordinarily STIFF. 

My first delve into the world of Mystery Rummy was Wyatt Earp. Since we only ever got to play it as a 2-player game, Jekyll and Hyde made more sense. I can see the similarities for sure. Feels like the same decision-making process in the game. There is probably a fun 2-player game in there somewhere...but it just doesn't do much for me. My wife prefers Lost Cities and Balloon Cup. The added complexity here does not add enjoyment for me. I think this is a case where the game and the player just didn't click very well, but that other people may get a lot more mileage out of Mystery Rummy: Jekyll and Hyde.

Another excellent rummy game from Mike Fitzgerald. It feels a bit more tactical than Jack the Ripper, as you get a "tit for tat" thing going as the players go back and forth laying down potions. The packaging for the game is wonderful and the cards, while difficult for me to shuffle with my stubby fingers, are very durable.I do prefer the theme of Jack the Ripper though.

Jack the Ripper is best with two players.
The difference between JtR and the others, is there is a guessing element to the game. At one point, you may make a gamble on who is Jack - if you are correct you get points.
That is nowhere else in the MR games.
Jekyll and Hyde - is strictly a two player game.
Rue Morgue - is good with partners
Al Capone - is Canasta-like
Bonnie and Clyde - is umm... not the best in the series.
Escape from Alcatraz - can be a bit more complicated and confusing.

Another excellent 2 player game, purchased based on our affection for its Ripper-themed predecessor. Compared to JtR, I would say this one is a bit simpler and the theme is a little less cohesive. However, the big gimmick here ("transforming" from Jekyll to Hyde) works just as well as the voting mechanic in JtR. The transformations, which can allow shutouts in which your opponent gets 0 score for the round, still don't seem to lead to the huge swings in scorer that we sometimes get from voting in JtR, but they are less luck-dependent. If you like JtR, I think you will like this one. They're different enough to justify having both.

Fourth entry in the Mystery Rummy series, this game is for two players only. The melds here can only be made if the meld matches the current identity of Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde.

Second game purchased to play in the hospital with recovering from the birth of my son.  Had very low expectations for this game when my husband purchased.  I looked at the art and was not impressed by the overall look of the game.  Boy was I in for a surprise!  I loved playing this game.  It was fairly easy to pick up and the longer you played, the more I liked the art.  The game is quick, the special twist is really cool, and I loved trying to go for a shutout.  Plus, I was able to teach this game to our friend without screwing up the rules.   Yep, this is a keeper.

RATING: 6
While I prefer Jack the Ripper as a two player game and the fact that Jack accommodates 3 players, this is definitely a nice very nice alternative.  The things I like about it is the following: the restriction on when you can play melds based on identity, shutouts are a lot more frequent, hording cards is dangerous as all cards in hand will be negative points at the end of the round, the transformation card altering melds and bonus points are given based on identity.  The one negative thing I can say about it is that this has the worst artwork of the entire series.  If you mainly play Mystery Rummy with just two players, I can't recommend Jekyll and Hyde enough despite giving Jack the Ripper a slight nod over it.

Played 1 time. Fun, but quite light. Only for 2 players, and not as good a game as another game in the series: Myster Rummy 4 Al Capone. MR4 spans from 2-4 players and offers more control and different sized 'suits' to add some nice risk to the game. After that, Jekyll and Hyde feels too simple and straightforward.

I  prefer Al Capone to Jekyll & Hyde.  Nothing too complicated here but It just doesn't flow as well for me.  Flipping Jekyll and Hyde over and back gets kind of dull.  Still, it's a good little two player card game that's great for traditional gamer friends or spouses.  Strong artwork and theme as well for a rummy game.

Happily, this is a game I can get my teenage daughter to play any weeknight so it gets some play time.

Note: I like the series and would like to get a copy of Jack the Ripper- they all need to be back in print!

RATING: 7
The Mystery Rummy games are nifty -- take regular card-set-collecting rummy, twist it up a little, and cram it into a theme.  This one has a neat effect of a card showing whether Jekyll is himself or Hyde -- and certain cards can only be played depending on that state.  Anyone can play "The Potion" to change that.  Pretty cool

RATING: 7
Very simple rules, quick gameplay, but it still has this "let's do another one" feeling. Luck of the draw sure plays an important role, but it's over so quickly that it doesn't spoil a good game... And you still feel that good decisions can reward you in the long run. Overall, a very good two players game.

First played June 4th, 2007.  This is a quick learn (provided you have someone explain and know mystery rummy games) and quick play (30 min).  There some strategy in this game as well as a fair share of luck.  This filler was fun, however I probably won't play it much.  The cards are very stiff and the theme probably makes the game better than it is.  Still it's worth a filler game if you know someone who has it.

Jekyll and Hyde is unequivocally the most luck based Mystery Rummy game out there.  The ease in which you can shut your opponent out with or without the uber over powered transformation card is a bit unnerving to say the least.  However, I'm absolutely in love with the mechanics.  The dual identity card is just plain neat and the gavel cards seem to be in just the right supply (it's harder to get overwhelmed with them like in Jack the Ripper).  This will probably end up being the most devisive game in the series, but I can see both sides and like the game for what it is.

Pretty good Rummy variant, but not as good as Mystery Rummy: Jack the Ripper with two. Basically, this has an identity card that flips between Jekyll and Hyde, and if you manage it correctly you can shut out the other player so only you score on a hand. Jack the Ripper had a similar mechanic that let you play the Ripper Escapes card if all the victim cards were played. The Ripper Escapes card requires multiple cards to be played, that can be concealed in other players' hands or in the deck, before it can be played, while the identity card only needs you to manage a single Potion card in your hand. It seems like the need to get all the victims in play is less likely to happen, so there are fewer shutouts and managing to get one seems far more satisfying. 

May change my mind if I play more.

Played this game, and I like it.  A good twist on Rummy, which lost all its allure with me as being "by rote".  I.e. the choices always felt obvious, but in this game with the changing of if I could lay melds or not happening, there was more choas, and tougher decisions to be made (or maybe just harder to make a good decision?).  Card counting will really help a player a lot in this game.  I'm very glad my SO likes it enough to play it with me as she isn't big on 2player games.

Interesting alter ego mechanism... melds that are identified with a J or H are established and manipulated by the 'current' face-up Duel Identity card.  With only 1 Transformation card in the entire deck, a player can change the nature (J/H) of any meld to suit their needs.  Mwha, ha, ha, ha, haaa.  

Not quite as deep as JtR, though a definite keeper.

* Kickstarted with #5! *

Third in the series, you draw, play down melds of character cards for points, then discard. Count points when a player runs out of cards. The catch is that you might be able to block the opponent from scoring any points.

PLUS: easy to learn, theme
MINUS: two players only when the rest are 2-4

RATING: 8
Nuts!  Only one play, but my wife says she likes this less than MR: Jack the Ripper... which I traded away because she never wanted to play.  So it's unlikely that this will get a second play.  Dammit.

Update: after having played this several more times with other people, it's really grown on me.  Also, in my first few games, I would always play Work in Lab as soon as I drew it, and draw from the Case File, but now I find myself holding on to it to pull specific cards out of London later in the game.

I still like the art in Jack the Ripper [i]much[/i] better, and I think I still like JtR better as a game, but I'm really glad I gave this one a second play.

2009-10-31: it pains me to say this, as my second copy of JtR cost me quite a bit more (off of ebay, about 15 minutes before the reprint was announced), but I've come to think that this is a better game than JtR.  Here, if you think someone is going for a shutout, there are things you can do to stop them; there, if they're going for Ripper Escapes, there's nothing you can do about it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Feels a lot like Mystery Rummy: Jack the Ripper but this is worse. Those special cards are key to control the game: with them, you'll get more cards and more control -> better chance to win and get high scores. Not well-balanced game and rummy-part isn't challenging enough.

Played once.  I really like this series of games, in general, and this was no exception.  It doesn't really do anything all that revolutionary to justify its existance (pretty much the same as Murders in the Rue Morgue, but for 2p), but a fun game in any case.

RATING: 3
Very simplified version of rummy that is geared for only two players.  Its straightforward set collections with 3-4 different action cards mixed in that can effect scoring.  The use of the Jekyll/Hyde card is clever in that you can only play melds of the type of character currently face up and the endgame bonus of either jekyll or hyde cards are doubled according to whoever is face up.  There's just not enough there to keep me interested for long though.

RATING: 5
We've enjoyed the Mystery Rummy games and [thing=106][/thing] was one of the first card games that we got.  We played it a lot and we found it to be a nice duel over scoring points and catching Jack the Ripper.  We finally got [thing=1265][/thing] in a math trade and we gave it a try.

Superficially, the game is similar to the first Mystery Rummy---match colored melds and throw in a few special action gavel cards.  The twist here is the shutout, which has a similar feeling to Shooting the Moon in Hearts, although it's a little easier.  The duel over controlling the Jekyll/Hyde card is interesting, although not quite as tense as it could be since it's pretty clear when a player is trying for a shutout.  The Transformation card does make this a little bit unpredictable, but I just wish there were more of them to make the game more interesting.

Overall, we found the game fun, but not quite as tense or interesting as the first one.  Still, it gives the Mystery Rummy mechanism a nice twist and we'll probably take it with us as a nice, portable card game.

Mystery rummy for 2 players.  It definitely feels like mystery rummy.  The most interesting mechanic is the ability to only play melds when Jekyll or Hyde is up.  The other interesting mechanic is the shutout.  If you only play Hyde when Hyde is up and you go out, the other player gets 0.  Same with Jekyll.  

One down side is you hand can "jam" where you cannot play cards without potion to flip the card.  So there can be a lot of turns where you draw and throw a card.  

But this does not happen frequently. Overall a fun game.

Not better than Alcatraz, Jack the Ripper or Wyatt Earp.

This is a simpler game than Mystery Rummy: Jack the Ripper, and I'm not sure yet if that's a good thing or not. It's definitely fun, but it also seems obvious what each player is going to do after just a few turns.

Shut-outs are much easier to accomplish than the Jack equivalent, and the game is less forgiving overall. I love the Jekyll/Hyde identity card mechanic, though it seems like it can also make for a slower game as you often can't play what's in your hand.

The cards are both more useful (it's easier to tell that gavels don't meld) and less useful (do we really need the rules for making melds on EVERY evidence card?) than in Jack, but are quite nice overall.

Good game, but thus far not quite as interesting as Jack.

I like this, but my wife is less than enthused. She believes the Transformation card can change the whole game for the worse. I figure it's simply a fact of play. I'd like to play more especially since we both like card games.

NOTE: House rule--we don't play the game with shutouts. If the transformation card is played the person who played it will get double points for the melds laid down that match the dual identity card, and the other person still scores points just not double.

Last played: February 2011.

Very average Rummy game. The Hyde/Jekyll thing doesn't seem to add any angst/tactical depth, just frustration at not being able to play the cards you want to play. There is very little interaction between the players, which is magnified by the blandness of the gavel cards. The gavels don't add any tactical consideration or subtelty to the game; all you're trying to do is draw cards you can play. The transformation card seemed overly powerful.

RATING: 6
Good and light for 2 players.  I would have liked it a bit more if there were different numbers as well as colors on the evidence cards.  Original rummy lets you build runs as well as matches, and this would have added another element.  But all in all this is a good game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Not much of a standout entry in the Mystery Rummy series, but like the rest, this is an enjoyable Rummy variant. The Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde card makes this one unique, as whichever side is facing up determines what cards are worth double points at the end of the game. If you end the game having all of one card type (Either Jekyll or Hyde), you shut the other player out. Can be pretty tense, but I wish that there was just a little more going on. The tug-of-war between both sides of the personality card should lead to more climactic endings.

GAVE TO FAMILYThis is a great addaption for card players.  It's rummy, plus the use of the double identiy card, which adds some strategy to the game.  We played it incorrectly at first, by not doubling cards scored that matched the double identity card, and the game dragged a bit.  Playing correctly, each game to 100 only took a few hands, and the double scoring makes controlling the identity card even more important.

Production value is top notch, however the cards are a little hard to shuffle.

If you like rummy, then you'll love this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The gimmick separating Jekyll & Hyde from other versions of the already gimmicky Mystery Rummy is the restriction that melds can only be played if the appropriate side of the double-sided Jekyll & Hyde card is face-up. This slight variation in the standard Mystery Rummy play didn't warrant the creation of a fifth game.

RATING: 7
Even though the theme is thin, it makes some sense via the card play, and most importantly, for me it makes rummy a more interesting game given this variant (plus the quality of the cardstock, box, and artwork are excellent). Nice addition to my collection. 

At the time I procured a copy, I basically got this game for my wife and 17-year-old stepson, who love to play rummy, a game I played a lot in high school but don't find interesting now compared to many other games. So, with the same hope I had in weening them off "Yahtzee" by turning them on to "Yahtzee Free-For-All," I got them "Mystery Rummy: Jekyll & Hyde" (especially since there is a series of these games). I got my wife to buy in a little, but not my step-son, who was hopelessly addicted to video games. 

However, I later played this with my sister, a total gamer, in July 2013 and she rated it a "10". 

Ordered new, October 2010.

There's not as many cards that allow you to pick up yet more cards as in other Mystery Rummy versions, so you're more limited to what you pick up and what's handed to you via the discard pile. The score for J cards vs H cards doubles / normals respectively, but switches when someone plays the Potion cards. So if J is doubling, and you're collecting mostly H cards and no potion cards (which flip the score card), your score is doomed. Rummy is best as a 2 player because cards aren't lost in the discard pile, and this is definitely an improvement on normal rummy, but other MR versions may be not quite so luck-laden in the scoring department. The option to shoot for a shut-out (scoring only J's, or H's, where the score card is the same) makes for a nice option, but in practice seems seldom seen given the lack of control over what cards you get. All of which makes this a pleasant, but not compelling, 2 player spouse type affair.

Great 2 Player Rummy Game by Mike Fitzgerald !! Simple to learn. Fun and fast. The theme really works with the mechanisms. The flavor-text and art really give tribute to Stevenson. Not as meaty as Mystery Rummy: Jack-the Ripper.

Similar to Jack the Ripper, but, honestly, a bit less fun...I hate to be a stickler, but the addition of a "Robert Lewis Stevenson" evidence card kind of breaks the theme...also, the gavel cards seem to dominate play, vs. Jack, where evidence was king...Still fun, just not AS fun.

Update 2014:  More fun than I remember, but maybe it is just because I'm older.  Moves and plays fast.  The theme is still meh for me, but since my copy of Jack the Ripper was destroyed in a tragic overflowing-dishwasher incident, this'll have to do.

RATING: 7
I like it.  A nice, relaxing two-player card game.  There's something sublime about sitting there, sorting your cards after a new deal, drawing and discarding, trying to go out before your opponent.  I think Mystery Rummy: Jack the Ripper and MR: Al Capone are both better games, but this one is quite enjoyable.  (Note that I've only played all three MR's with just two players.)  The main flaw with Jekyll & Hyde is it's "hook":  there's a Jekyll/Hyde card, and you can only play cards that match the current state (J or H).  Because of this, more than the other MR's, J&H can degenerate to a point where both players are drawing and then discarding the same card they drew, several turns in a row, burning through the deck, waiting to get the perfect lucky card.  This actually happens not too infrequently in J&H, but usually doesn't turn up in the other MR's.  It doesn't ruin the game, but that's the main weakness.  The Shutout is also less challenging than JtR's Ripper Escapes, or AC's Shutout, and J&H's Gavel cards aren't as tactically deep.  I don't mean to sound like I'm bashing it, though -- fun game, but if you're new to the series, start with Jack or Al.

This just edges out Jack the Ripper right now because, though Ripper is probably a better game, Jekyll is easier to teach due to fewer cards that fall outside the norm. It's a better gateway card game. Plus, there are some genuinely tense and fun moments as each of you are trying for a shutout in opposite characters, so there's constant switching of the Identity Card.

I really like rummy games, so this is a winner.  Unfortunately, it is third in a series where the two previous games are games I would much rather play, particularly Jack the Ripper.  I'm not even sure what it is about this game that turns me off.  I think the dual identity thing just grates against my sensibilities -- it's a card game after all, which should make it random enough. -- Update:  I've decided I really dislike the closeout scoring conditions.

[U.S. Games 2003 edition] {couple, murder; rummy-variant} MR3 derives from the similar core of MR1. However, the "dual identity" matching and shut-out differentiate MR3 from MR1. Similar to MR1, it's thematic and easy to learn. It is a very solid couple game, too.

The "transformation" card is powerful; a player should act promptly to guard against this card when he doesn't have it or make the best use of this card when he has it.

Our first Mystery Rummy, and definitely a favorite.  Easy rules, easy to understand "shut-out".  Theme enticed us, although it mostly dissolves from the sets fairly quickly in game play, still stays alive due to the Dual Identity card.  I only wish the quality of the cards was better: they stand up to use by being thick, but this also makes shuffling difficult, in a game of set-collecting over multiple rounds.

Everytime I introduce this game to a rummy player, they scoff abit about the rule changes. And when I win the 1st game (usually last) they blame it on the game's mechanics; "Let's play regular rummy and I'll whip your *blank*."

I've never played regular rummy, so I can't draw any comparisions between the two games. However, I enjoy this card game. It presents a lot of options and choices during teh course of a hand. Do I play this potion and risk switching to Hyde and losing my double points on all my Jekyll cards in hopes of drawing a card to make a meld, or do I discard it? Should I play the transformation on my cards or play it on my opponent since he's obviously trying to shut me out? I can only deduce that these few simple additions to the core rules of rummy have enhanced it many times over. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good "couples" game.

Yeah, there's only one twist to this Rummy game, but it provides more enjoyment to me than vanilla Rummy.  It's the first I played of the Mystery Rummy series, so it still has a soft spot with me.  I recently read an article that described the game as elegant, and I would have to agree: It's simple, easy to grasp, and still balanced well enough to be a challenge to play.

20-plus plays: 2 players

On loan to KA.  Cool if he keeps it, as it was "meh" for us.

2nd favourite Mystery Rummy game, just behind Ripper. Simple mechanics with good balance of luck/skill.

Standard rummy. The 2P design was interesting but I'd prefer a game that can scale to additional players if I'm going to own one of them.

I love it when games combine cards, maniacal laughter, and funny hair.

A good game, but I think I like the voting of [gameid=106], so I'm rating this a bit lower. This is after just two plays though, so the rating is tentative.

Doesn't work as well as Jack the Ripper or Al Capone. Not so bad, it's just not as much fun as the others.

My very first game purchase. Great card game.

A couple of nice flavorful twists added to the classic gin rummy.  I imagine it should appeal to fans of the original.  As for me, I've always considered it to be a bit too simplistic for my liking.  Really did not care for the material for the card stock, stiff and unwieldy, just terrible.

Mike Fitzgerald takes Gin and 500 Rummy and turns it on its ear.  The Jekyll/Hyde mechanic is wonderful, and the theme oozes throughout.  A delight to play with my wife time and again.

I'm loving Mystery Rummy all over again.  This game is quick, strategic and interesting.  I don't expect I'll grow tired of it quickly.

Don't like the mechanism as much as Murders in the Rue Morgue.

Like many rummy games, this game can really stall if you don't draw what you need. Still, it's pretty fun and has some clever mechanics.

05/05/06:  Rating:  6.  The reason this game gets a 6 rather than a 7 is because, as far as two player games go, there are other games I'd rather play, even on the same lightness/game-length scale as Jekyll & Hyde.  On the other hand, if the game of rummy is your crack cocaine, I could not recommend a better two player game for you.  I think if people could, for a moment, forget about the Atlantic Ocean, this game would fit nicely in the Kosmos 2 player series of games.

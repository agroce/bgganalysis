Good with the right group, but not really a "game" so much as it is an exercise in just being silly.

Bit of a game changer here adding the ability to be able to own cards for eternity good fun expansion which can change the way a game goes. For instance you own the card you can't lose with the card, in a game where the players could not say 4 hot words and I could I loved being able to drop the words into the minds of the people and try trip them up

When we tried combining this "expansion" alongside the base game it seemed to drag things out a bit longer than necessary (perhaps it was just too many layers of special rules.)  However when we played Legacies by itself it worked perfectly.  People loved adding their own twist to the cards, and everyone gets excited about claiming one for themselves.  I'm interested to see what else will happen with these cards, as we slowly explore the deck and open up some of the extra card packs.  Surprisingly, this concept works, and I'd recommend it to fans of the original game.

An OK game for what it is, a light tongue-in-check mix of Fluxx and the legacy concept where you write on the cards.

I don't like this version of the game as much as I did the original and its expansion. That may change as the game gets played and developed but thats something I'm going to have to see.

Wow... what a weird game.  Can't think of when I'd play this.  Less strategic and slightly more funny than flux.

Like other "playtest" games, it is interesting for a little bit, but starts to get old fast.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
In all honesty, I'd love to give this a 10, since we've had THAT much fun with it. I own Doom, Dark Souls, Cards Against Humanity, and others, and this is the game my buddies and I have spent the most time playing.
For the sake of an objective review, I'll give it a 7, since there are drawbacks if you're not playing with the right group. 
That being said, WDPT Legacies, Either, and Pasted On Theme at All (when combined) have made for some of my best tabletop memories.

This version is a lot of fun. I keep a specific version to play between a certain group as names are written on the cards which effect future games.

It is a great filler.  Good send up of the Legacy game years before Legacy games became a real thing.

I never had so little enjoyment watching people play a game than this one. I could not wait for it to be over. I guess when I saw a card, the only thing I remember about it that at the very bottom of the paragraph, it would say something like "the person on your left loses," which was just an arbitrary event. My friends enjoyed the humorous paragraph though. So a great game if you like fluff and something mindless.

rated high for the fun factor.  This game is what it is. Absurd and amusing.  I played it, then went out and bought the other two prequels.  I hate fluxx and this game fills the same niche without being annoying.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
If I'm in the mood for a completely silly game with no strategy, this is the one I'll request. It's especially great for the same group thanks to the permanent changes to the cards. It's not a masterpiece, but it can be a riot with the right crowd.

A great take on the We Didn't Playtest This at All. Since the games are so short, the cards get changed quite frequently, and all sorts of wackiness can occur.

RATING: 9
Hilarious! Love it.  Love the humour, and being able to add information on the cards, changes the game a lot.  It makes it unique and also things change depending on who's name is on the card, what they write.  Love it!
This game just makes me laugh and smile.  This is one of those games that has found the magical ingredient which brings fun, joy, and laughter wherever it gets played.  It's a filler, but one that I'll play more than once, plus this game makes me want to buy a copy for all my friends.  It's a game that I can bring out at a restaurant etc. that'll probably make people forget that they're hungry.
Even looking at the box makes me fee happy :)  Asmadi Games, how did you box happiness into a board game...hmm...the mystery continues... (me thinks it has to do with Chris)

I feel like this is the game Fluxx wanted to be. Fairly random goofy fun with minimal risk of it overstaying its welcome. Legacy version is great because I don't think anyone is taking it seriously enough to care if the cards get a little beatup/written on. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Fast, stupid, fun. What more is there to say? I have far more plays of this than actually counted. It's a much better game with 3+, but adding too many becomes far too chaotic. Also plays much better with expansions mixed in.

It's what fluxx wanted to be.

NEEDS to be mixed in with expansions. Far too much legwork off the bat if only playing with this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
6.5 - Like the original game this is fun in a non competitive, fast action, take that kind of way and this version has you write all over the cards and take ownership of them when you win a game with one making you immune to it in the future.

the best of the Playtest line.

I take this game far more seriously that anyone else I've met, especially the designer.  I feel it captures something fundamental about the nature of games and the unspoken formalism of games, winning, and motivation.

Whereas the other games in this series rubbed me up the wrong way, this one caught me completely by surprise.  The permanent modification aspect (which joyfully mocks the Legacy concept even though it was barely a thing when this game came out) is exactly what is needed to turn what is still only an activity into a more participatory experience.  That individual games are over within a turn or two is important too.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
This is a good version of the game.  The cards are extra silly and even more interactive.  Modifying the cards with a sharpie works well, but it does require a regular gaming group to get the most out of it.

This game shouldn't be as fun as it is.  It really is stupid, which is what makes it fun.  The "Legacy" part of it is a nice addition.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is the real jewel in the We Didn't Playtest This series.  I'm still not sure that I'd want to only play with this set, but mixing legacies into the other two sets gives a fun, fast, filler game

Flux like but much more fun, shorter.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
Funny for one or two minutes (which is one or two games), and then you never want to touch it again.  I didn't expect much more, but my friend was hoping it would be a better version of Fluxx.  Honestly, I prefer Fluxx if only because it lasts a little longer and it has the gambler's fallacy of thinking your win could be right around the corner.  This literally just makes people lose based on random conditions, which is far harsher and less fun for the participants.  Everyone would rather win based on a BS card than lose.

Actually had a lot of fun with this on new years.  It's what to be expected from the series, with a little extra somethin, somethin.  I'm not sure the "legacies" part really does much, but it's amusing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It's a neat idea, but the cards in Legacy seem to be more focused on being goofy than being chaotic than WDPT. I still like it for the Legacy aspect, but the fact that the WDPT cards were designed to be chaotic is what made it fun for me.

Just a fun party fest of a game. Not as good as Fluxx but still fun. The Legacies is cool.

This is an initial rating after two attempts to get this going with a group of five and three. BORING setup phase which takes an inordinate amount of time. Furthermore, just getting everything back in the box is an ordeal. I don't see how 15 stories (five stories with three variations for each) is going to make this worth hauling out repeatedly, if ever.

I would rather just play Arkham Horror.

RATING: 7.5
Rated based on game potential, overall design and expandability.

Numerous rules mistakes and game mechanics that start to be discussed in the forums make the rating provisional until it can be decided if the game has major flaws or not.

Rating lowered : I don´t think the game has major flaws, but still too many little nuisances keep coming that will have to be answered in future FAQs. Annoying.

Played 6 times in both roles and 3 out of 5 stories several times. The game is great but has a lot of room for improvement that will keep me waiting for more. Replayability might start to be a problem a little bit too soon.

Rating lowered : Replayability might not be such an issue. Starting to see the shines of a great game design, and learnt to live with the concessions made. Sadly, the careless customer support received is the main motive for this rating drop. I don´t feel optimistic anymore about the future fixes to the abundant mistakes made with the first edition of the game

But given the theme and the type of game this aimed to be (and I hope it will be someday in the future...) is still in my top 10. Will probably change my rating when the first expansion comes out.

Edit August 2013 : Rating raised since last Expansion addressed quite a few issues and put the game in the right track. In any case, one of the most played games in my collection, so tha must mean something...

El concepto de Ameritrash hecho juego con la ambientación de la obra de H.P.Lovecraft. Mansión a explorar y buscar pistas, sucesos, bichos raros que salen y te hacen perder cordura o vida, y diferentes personajes estereotipados a elegir con buenas variables de poderes y objetos, etc. El juego es asimétrico llevando un jugador al "guardian" de la mansión haciendo la vida imposible al resto de personajes/jugadores que cooperan para llevar a cabo su misión. En mi opinión es un buen juego de este tipo, pero a mi no me llaman nada, y se me hace tremendamente larga la partida y repetitivas las mecánicas y acciones muy típicas de estos juegos. Azar y dado por doquier, y ninguna sorpresa de mecánicas. La inmersión en el juego podría mejorar bastante, y no es ni de lejos la de un  juego de rol, que en estas circunstancias le da mil patadas, salvando las evidentes diferencias.

Only 1 play so far so the rating may change. Fell a little flat for me but a lot of that may be due to the scenario we played (Scenario 1) which seemed quite basic and didn't leave the keeper much to do. Game does take longer to play than advertised though, at least 90 minutes (not including setup).

Playing evil has never been so much fun!  However... it is not exactly all that much fun for the players.  In that sense it is truly a Lovecraftian game - it feels hopeless.  My husband loves playing evil and crushing us all.  Now, if only good would win more often.

So, we finally won again - and the feeling of winning was absolutely amazing!  Too bad we still lose more often than win.  Still, we are learning the best strategies, and perhaps, by our tenth game, we will have this down.

Fantastic game! Thematically brilliant. Have had many (many) hours of fun scaring people as the keeper! Only gripes are that it is very hard for the other players to win and the rules are very complicated and sometimes slightly unclear.

There isn't anything inherently wrong with the game (though perhaps the setup time) but having played it only one time I already see the problem. The game, in a desperate pitch to keep each mission fresh, uses one or two monsters per story. It would get old to kill the same enemy dozens of times. I think this game is fun and fine, but more often than not I'd rather play something a little quicker to put out, play, and put up again.

[2-5] What a richly thematic game! I was hoping for a classic, adventure/story-telling game that really plays upon a haunted house vibe and I wasn't disappointed in the slightest. I always wanted to get into the Call of Cthulhu RPG but haven't ever taken the plunge. I'm so happy that it went over well and am looking forward to plays in the future. Here's hoping for continued release of stories and demons!

It's replaced Arkham Horror for us because it's so much more thematic and just easier to get to the table. Setup time can be a downer but the system is fantastic, especially with painted miniatures.

I LOVE THIS ONE!  The theme *OOZES* from the game!  Production is fantastic!  PLASTIC!!!  It feels very Lovecraftian and works very well!

Despite my enthusiasm, only rates an 8 for a few reasons:
(a)  It's on the longer side (a tad long for what it does).
(b)  Requires one person to act as the GM (they know the whole story in advance and are running the game for the other players and not really against them - it's up to the GM to ensure a fun play experience rather than "win").
(c)  Has a long set up (requires preparation in advance and then 15-30 min. to set up the board when you do play).

Three games tried, and two of them have been problematic because of design flaws in the scenarios.  The trouble is that this is the kind of game you aren't going to read threads on here at the geek, because unless one of your group is always the bad guy you want to avoid spoilers, and so the necessary fixes aren't made in time.  When we realised, in the last game, that there was a lock, the key to which was behind it with no other way of getting past, my group really went cold on this one.

The story stuff was quite good. The keeper had some fun. But I don't think the players had that much choice or fun. Was also very attritional, and I as the keeper found that I usually had to carefully beat down one character a lot of the time to win. Other than that, the pieces are nice... hmmm 'Shoggoth'.

Simply the worst game I ever played. The keeper may have lots of fun driving detectives on the map wherever he wants, but the detectives have no chance to enjoy. The first who gets the clue must then get the other clues, and the other have no chances to do anything at all but to roll dices for will and get some luck. Boring, long setup. Bad.

Got in a trade. Played Once.
Unfortunately the previous owner had glued the original monsters in their stands, which stuck the chits in place too, causing a major problem when the sequel came out and I couldn't swap to the new counters!

I think this original edition was a good idea, but ultimately the keeper has so much more to do than anyone else, it was hard to maintain the fun for them. The app may lead to an expensive version of the game without the components for a keeper, but I can't see me going back to this one.

Got a preview yesterday. The normal high quality FF cards game boards were there. The figures were nice but didn't stick to the bases & need to be painted. A long time to set up with lots of different card stacks ala AH. We didn't get very far through a game as we were new to the rules. I'd best descibe it as a tactical game of AH. I pre-ordered a copy after the experience.

A melding of Betrayal at House on the Hill with familiar mechanics from Descent was not at all a bad idea.  Sadly, it doesn't really come off for me.  Mansions brings a little more narrative coherence to Betrayal's wandering around and picking up stuff, but overall I found that narrative functional, prosaic and lacking in Lovecraftian flavour.

In Mansions, the Keeper seems to have the most fun and the lion's share of the decisions.  The player characters really are just moving around finding clues, items and puzzles.  If you're a puzzler you'll probably find those in Mansions too straightforward.  If you're not, you probably won't welcome their distraction. As with Descent, I found myself thinking that with this sort of time investment required, I'd much rather be doing some actual role playing.

As usual, Fantasy Flight has done a very nice production job, with atmospheric artwork and the miniatures of the large monsters particularly good.

RATING: 6.8
I wanted to like this game so much, but it turned out to be so much more hype than substance - at least after my first play.  

It's dripping with a great theme and has some interesting mechanisms but, well, you know how some games take a long time but don't feel like they do?  This wasn't one of those games.  

Our five player game had four newbies playing against one person with one game's experience under his belt.  It took over four hours - even allowing for a short break for food.  The problem wasn't just the length though.  It was the huge amount of downtime in the game.  Some of that might come from the inexperience of the game with our group, but it's clear the game has a problem in that regard.  

In addition, the combat mechanism is pretty lame to me.  Some people have touted it in their reviews as being a strength of the game.  I guess those people and I have very different tastes.  At first I thought it just pointless because the "random" element of the card draw determining how you attack made planning seem utterly pointless.  Then, as the game dragged on, and on, and on, I realized that while it seemed random it's actually rather predictable and even though it means you CAN actually plan, it's somewhat dull.  There were very few interesting decisions when playing as an investigator.  Perhaps being the keeper has more interesting decisions?

I'll give it one more try, but if it doesn't seriously redeem itself then it won't get a third try.  There are too many other games I like or want to try to waste time on an overly-long and vastly overrated (at the current time) game like this.

RATING: 7
2nd edition made it obsolete for us, we just use the minis and tiles now. It was fun, but too much downtime and setup for what it was worth. If you like playing the Keeper / GM then by all means stick to the first edition. We prefer the full co-op against the app that the 2nd esition offers.

Rating after 1 play:  As a fan of thematic horror games like Last Night on Earth, I'd been watching this for a while and was very interested in the high ratings and comments.

At first glance the game components, the board and the minis were amazing.  The artwork and production beautiful and you could feel the Cthulhu theme everywhere as the game commenced.  But that was where things started to unravel for me.  

It may play well when you are the master, because you have all the information available to you and plenty of decisions to make.  But as a player, your options feel limited and in many respects, insignificant.  There just aren't enough meaningful decisions to make and the characters feel inconsequential as they walk their way through semi-scripted scenarios.  The way the game "scripts" you to run back and forth across the board to achieve your goals was frankly, downright annoying.  Whilst the puzzles proved novel mechanism at the start, the rapidly became a pointless distraction to the flow of the game.

The poor layout of the rule book and the sheer volume of cards and variations included for each of the multiple situational conditions added considerably to the game length, which was way too long.  Playing out at 4+ hours, there just wasn't anywhere near enough to maintain my interest.

I can see how some people would love this game, particularly for the pseudo-RPG nature of it, however for me it just fell flat.  I probably should give it another try, but in reality, there are too many other games out there I'd much rather play.

RATING: 3
I have played Call of Cthulhu for over 25 years; this game was a must play so I was looking forward to our game. However, it was a major disappointment for the prime reason of how luck driven the game is. It is almost totally dependent on where the cards are; over half of the randomly placed cards on the board were "you find nothing of interest" and we turned these over with the tedium of trying to find something useful. The dice rolls killed the interest after a while. Failing adds to the game and can be entertaining, but having at least 12 successive failures from the start just is not fun. As a group, when it mattered we did not make a single key roll. Going the wrong way (a 50:50 choice) delayed us about 6 turns and in the end we jacked it in after wasting 60 minutes to find the first clue. 
A game like this should have some degree of player control, and this was lacking. It is far too linear, and replayability appears to be minimal once you know the general story. A big letdown, without the expansions (which may have sorted some of the problems out) as it stands, this is a classic bad game.

Does a very good job of capturing the Call of Cthulhu theme with its miniatures, scenarios, and flavour text. Wish the base game came with more than 5 scenarios, but love how they can change based on the Keeper's decisions at the start. Storage, however, is a nightmare. No bags or inserts are provided for any of the components, forcing you to find your own solution. We just never ended up playing this game enough to justify keeping it. Sold in FallCon 30 auction.

The games play is immersive and the mechanics are pretty easy. Two huge problems though. Dungeons crawls such as this require more than just two people to make the experience worthwhile and 90% of the time it is just the two of us. Second are those puzzles. I tell you there is nothing more exciting than exploring a dank cellar complete with an alter and then having to stop the game for 5 minutes while one of our party tries to figure out how to rewire a circuit box. This just takes you totally out of the game. We thought so from the beginning and we're happy to find that one of our favorite game designers thought the same. A good game for some just not for us.

This is designer Corey K's first flop for me. Lots of interesting mechanics, but they don't add up to a good game.  Way too long to setup and play (if you have 3-4 people playing investigators) for the amount of fun you get in return.

You can't swing a cat without drawing a card (or having one played on you) in this game.

Aunque he de reconocer que es entretenido le saco un par de pegas:

Se tarda media hora aproximadamente en montar el tablero de juego. Los investigadores ayudan durante 5-10 minutos, luego deben dejar al guardián a solas para que monte el resto de componentes "secretos". Durante 20 minutos el guardián se queda solo murmurando para sí mismo mientras los demás se divierten (o aburren) en otra parte. Una carta colocada en el lugar equivocado puede arruinar 2 horas de partida. Es recomendable que el guardián lo revise todo antes de dar por finalizado el montaje (eso son otros 5 minutitos...)

A por la segunda pega...

A las historias las falta más texto de ambientación que permita a los jugadores enterarse mejor de que es lo que está pasando, por que está pasando y como acabará todo si no logran detener los planes del guardián. Las cartas de pista son muy pequeñas y el poco texto que cabe en ellas es insuficiente para darle ese toque de investigación que este juego pretende vendernos. Los textos deberían venir ampliados en el libro del guardián y las cartas solo ser un breve resumen o un simple recordatorio del párrafo que hay que leer. Los eventos en lugar de complementar la historia a veces la hacen más confusa o directamente no tienen nada que ver.

Ejemplo: "Aparece un zombi, envuelto en llamas, corriendo por el pasillo" -WTF!!

As a fan of Lovecraft's fiction I truly wanted to love this game. Hell I'd have settled or liking it, but the fiddlyness, lack of copy editing and no incentive for exploration quickly sunk this one.

It played like LNOE - heavily biased against a players, and probably playtested by people who had played the game extensively. A keeper has to take it a bit easy on learners to make the game seem fair and balanced. As it stands, it felt fair and balanced like Fox News.

This game is a little mechanically broken, but the aesthetics and theme are fantastic.  I painted my miniatures to match the high quality playing boards, and it looks great.  As to the mechanics - I've had to play this game a little bit like a role-playing game, meaning: acting as a GM instead of an opponent to the player characters...facilitating an experience instead of putting 100% effort into actively beating them.

Rating based on just one play.

I'm not sure if the genre is not for me, or if I've recently just played a few poorly designed representatives.  It's also possible we played a particularly bad scenario, but I doubt it.

Lots of bits and cards and items, but very little strategy.  Rarely did I feel like I had to think about my actions or make any choices.  I'd wait for my turn and then walk towards the nearest event.  Then something good would happen and I'd get another card (half of which I never ended up using), or something bad would happen and I'd roll some dice to see how bad.

Then the keeper would take over and do something annoying like move me backwards a few spaces -- so I'd have to cover the same ground next turn.

I want to like heavily themed games like this, but I need to feel like I'm facing some real choices.

Story in a game done well. You really get a sense of being in a fun filled action packed Lovecraftian film with this game. The keeper has lots of things to do to actually feel like a player in the game and not just like a bystander going through the motions. The system is easy to grasp and the production values are incredible. 
Set up is really long and some games can be slow to start with but it always seems like there is some sort of cinematic gem in every game.

Great theme, nice bits, a very scripted game.  It was fine, but it feels like less of a game than a storytelling activity.  I feel that there aren't many choices to be made, you're just kind of letting the game play you.  I'll try it again, but not my thing so far.

This is such an incredibly thematic and narrative game. The aspects of hidden information and the investigators gradually discovering their objective make for something much greater than a simple dungeon crawl experience. I immediately got rid of Arkham/Eldrich Horror after playing this as neither can compare.

RATING: 8.5
Love the feel of this game. Exploring the mansion provides a suspenseful experience. Have to be careful to set up the game correctly. Set up takes a long time. The combat system could be better. The card combat system is slower than if there was a simple dice mechanic. I like having to find the clues to unravel the mysteries. One versus many game similar to Descent and Imperial Assault. The puzzles are okay. PROS: fun theme, tiles are very nice, exploration. CONS: set up time, combat, person playing as Keeper has a lot to keep track of, minis could be better. 

UPDATE: Second edition replaces this edition in my top 10. The App in the second edition speeds up combat and reduces setup time SIGNIFICANTLY. The app plays role of Keeper so someone doesn't have to track all that information.

Another iteration of the Descent / Arkham Horror game engine with a 1 vs. all approach.  I like it better than Arkham on first play.  It seems to move faster.  Like other FFG products they are going to expansion this to death.

Yeah, you're probably going to want to sleeve the cards if you see yourself playing this a lot.  One thing that was new was seeing how many cards we went through to resolve a specific type of attack.  We cycled the deck much more frequently than I anticipated.

Played first game last night with two players ( one investigator and one keeper ).

Fun game! I'm sure it would be quite a bit better even with more investigators. As an old DM, it took some adjusting on my part to actually be picking on the player instead of trying to be neutral.

Long setup for this one, especially for the first game. Now it'll go faster, but still not going to be a quick setup, even with experience. No a problem, just a fact of the complexity of the game.

I really enjoyed this one.

RATING: 4
Dungeon-crawl game. Has some interesting concepts like the puzzles you've got to complete to open rooms, but when it comes down to it it's just another co-op game. It's better than Arkham Horror, but I still won't be begging to play it, and will likely try to avoid playing it if possible.

I think my issue with games like this is that the strategic decisions are minimized, and luck is maximized. Whether or not a plan works isn't so much contengient on whether or not it's a good plan, but whether or not the scenario is designed well and the dice favor you.

Better is like Warhammer - where if you have a good plan, a few poor dice rolls don't really hinder you (a lot do, but still your victory status is primarily decided by how clever you are during the game).

Story, story and more story, this game is full of it, and that is a good thing. 
One player controls the keeper and the rest of the players control the Investigators.

Monsters and cultists can be summoned by the keeper, rooms can burn, the lights can go out, other rooms might be locked and the investigators have to solve puzzles to enter. 
The keeper also plays during the investigators turns using mythos cards and trauma cards and thus making the task more difficult for the investigators.

Investigators gather weapons and artifacts to fight monsters, but most importantly they find clues. Once the investigators find enough clues (depending on the story) they discover the whole plot, and understand what the keeper's objective is and what they must do to win the game.

The setup is a bit longer than most games, placing the mansion tiles and the keeper placing the cards are the things that take the most time. Everything else is faster.

Nice stories right out of the box (for the most part, the scenarios i've seen so far could be better designed). Not really deterministic, so if you cannot tolerate a luck-prpone game, stay away. Also the 1-vs-all format is always a tricky thing, so beware who you play with. For now, both games I played were decided on the last dice roll (once in favor of the keeper, once in favor of the investigators) even if during the game the tension and the fact of how close both sides are towards winning are not really apparent. It does climax well though..

Was looking forward a lot to this game and it's not bad.  It looks very very good, nice that it has the same art as Arkham Horror as well.

I like this game a lot.  I want to love it and it has the potential for a great game but it needs a better story line for the different scenes. 

Although fellow BGG'ers have helped a lot to fill in this story line it is no excuse for a poor or non-existent story.  This is not an action game or a strategy game or any other game ... it drips in theme and thats what makes it great ... but it needs a compelling and complet story or the game just does not work!!!

I have made minor, minor, mistakes while setting up the thing and within the first turn, the game was ruined.

In comparison to "Betrayal at House on the Hill":
Components: +++
Creative Writing/Stories: -- Korey is not a professional writer like Glassco, although this is only in comparison. The stories ARE good.
Gameplay: ?+ about the same. Bit more strategic, particularly becase the bad guy plays a bit like Descent's overlord. But not the fulfilling strategic game we were expecting.
Replayability: ?- Same, maybe a bit less.

If you do not own "Betrayal at House on the Hill"
Buy it. It is a good family interactive story game with excellent components and good gameplay. You should own either this, or Betrayal, or Tales of the Arabian nights(more storytelling, less strategy)

This game has a long setup time, and the forums thrive with people complaining about the numerous errata, and probably not all of the stories/objectives are equal in their quality.

It is a blender. The atmosphere is big in the beginning but the more you fight the more it becomes obvious that this game has not much to offer gameplay wise. The investigators are played by this game - they did not have many options on their turn. Some scenarios are broken or just uninteresting. The combat system which sounded good at first is really annoying as well: On the one hand you draw through the whole deck very fast so you read the same cards over and over again and on the other side you do not have any possibility of influence. In Arkham Horror you can adjust your player values, in MoM you can only add your luck value to your specific tested ability. Meh...

So all in all: Play Arkham Horror instead for a much better Lovecraft experience!

If you like adventure gaming with a creepy story and an excellent co op with a Keeper, stop searching.

Throw away 60% of your board game collections and buy the basic box along with all Mansions of Madness expansions.

The first time we played I wasn't very impressed, but it was the "learning game" and I knew that it would get better.  Next day we tried it again and it was much more fun.

MoM is not nearly as good as Arkham Horror, but it plays much faster.  I still have to experience it from the investigators side.

Make sure you start early. Seems a bit unbalanced in favor of the keeper, but the fact that you aren't subject to permadeath until the objective is revealed helps to counter that. Better than a murder mystery party and it will make you hate the game master more than you ever have!

Had a ton of fun with this, if you want a copy while it's out of print Barnes & Nobles seems to have some for the normal price, not 150 like Amazon is stating right now.  For this game I played with my 15 year old, 11 year old and wife to test it out.  I didn't purposely play too brutaly for them so they could enjoy it, instead I had a lot of fun messing with them.  After everything that happened, the end of the game came down to one roll, my 11 year old rolled a 10, the floor fell out and everyone died.  I was hoping they would just barely win, but the effect still stuck and they enjoyed the game which was a total win for me, take that call of duty.

Another game in the FFG Lovecraft Mythos series. The idea behind the game is nice and it delivers on gameplay. The game is fun to play and tense till the end. But again it suffers from the FFG disease of less than thematic game elements that really spoil the game for me to a certain extend. In my first game I lost my guns in the very first turn stating I forgot to bring ammo. Really?! That's just awful design as it basically nullifies the choices I made in setup. Making players feel like their choices don't matter is never a good idea. The puzzles and treasure hunt feel are well done though. Components are also very nice. So this game gets a thumbs up from me in the end. But only just.

RATING: 9
In my endless and often fruitless search for thematic games I finally stumbled into Mansions of Madness, a superb game that impressed me both for its thematic depth and gameplay: even though I’m not a Lovecraft fan (and neither a horror genre’s) I revel in playing Mansions of Madness for it’s such a successful crossover between an RPG and a boardgame that it manages to create an immersive and dripping atmosphere just by taking the best out of both genres.
Sadly though, this blend’s most notable casualty is a character’s interpretation, because the game - however long - is too short to allow it: in order to survive instead everyone needs to do everything, for the better or worse.

I already had some experience with Betrayal at the House on the Hill, a game that looks similar to this one and never fails to appease me: yet it fades when compared to Mansions of Madness, for this latter is more and better in everthing. It must be noted though that the two games appeal two different audiences or moods: Betrayal at the House on the Hill is more of a lighter, shorter and Goosebumps-like cooperative game, while Mansions of Madness is a deeper, longer and full-immersive horror game, made harder by a dedicated keeper/GM player.

All in all, Mansions of Madness is the perfect game for any special occasion, because it requires some time, involves all the players alike and gratifies all of them equally. Nonetheless, its complexity is its only drawback as well: actually it can’t be played repeatedly, because each scenario’s replayabilty is pretty limited, at least with the same players.

Got some cool aspects to it, and I appreciate the attempt at making a story-based investigation game.  But for me, Descent does what it does better, smoother, and with fewer "hints" that the players need to pick up to even have a chance at success.

Just bought this today.  Going through the rules and will give it a try with my wife.  From everything I have read it looks pretty good.  Big HP Lovecraft fan so hopefully this will just add to the gaming experience.  

Will comment more after 1st or 2nd game.

***************************

Ok, played 1st solo game and really like this game.  It has a nice Lovecraft feel to it and is a little on the lighter side to Arkham Horror which should appeal to some.  It played out in about 2 hours with neat systems, turn sequence and suspense.  Looking forward to my first game with a real opponent.

RATING: 6
Played 2 games now. First a 4 player, 2nd a 5 player game. I, the owner of the game played as the Keeper both games. I equate this as a mixture of House on the Hill, Descent, and Arkham Horror but tighter, faster, and better than all of them. Both games were very fun and close for both sides. Actually prefer the 5 player game. Looking forward to more plays and to explore the other stories. Like to see some expansions for this soon to keep the fun going.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Fully co-operative, RPG-lite (experience) type of game, but it's largely a race to explore the map and solve a mystery before time runs out.

UPDATE 2014: I'm no longer a fan of this game.  I like some of the puzzles, and I usually like one-vs-many games; however, the luck of the cards, die rolls, red herrings and painful searching for objectives (not knowing if you're making progress) makes the game really slow-paced and frustrating for me.  Largely, it's a timed race to explore the map and reveal clue/objective cards.  Maybe it's a better game if you go in with the mindset/approach that the monsters are too difficult/scary to kill so you're going to run past/away from almost all of them in an effort to reveal clues as fast as possible.  Note to self: Fitch and Sarah would like to try with all investigators splitting up and running room-to-room rapidly.  Our 2014 game was very long and we failed to reveal several clue cards, resulting in an unsatisfying game.  Also, the replayability of M.o.M. is very poor.  Playing the same scenario with slightly different clues/objectives just sounds lame.  Ultimately, the game is designed to sell you expansions if you don't have the creativity/time to make your own scenarios; it might as well be called "Expansions of Madness" because it'll become a money pit like CCGs, then just collect dust because you've played all the scenarios.

RATING: 7.5
I enjoyed this one.  It's more of an 'experience' than a skill based game especially if you play as the keeper.  If strategy and pure skill is what you look for in a game then this isn't it.  It is harsh like Arkham and you are at the mercy of the dice when playing as an investigator, but I think as long as you absorb yourself in the story, it doesn't really matter what happens!

Alright, so the system that the game runs on itself is cool.  The scenarios are rather inconsistent.  There's only 5 in the box, 2 of them are duds, and none of them are as repayable as FFG would like you to think that they are.  I'd love FFG skip a boxed expansion to go for a scenario book, much like Tide of Iron.

RATING: 7
Needs the right mood. Sometimes it doesn't work at all. Should be played with a dedicated GM and not competitively. If it works, it's really good and offers a feeling no other game I have does with its great atmosphere,intense finish and engaging story.

The game starts quite slow and builds up tension. Investigators usually rush out to find out what's the goal of their game and the Overlord hinders them. After the win condition is revealed things change drastically. Investigators are near madness / death and try their best to finish the game, while the overlord schemes the final blow.

There's a lot of badness that can happen.
 1) It's easy for the investigators to screw up early (without knowing for a long time). The most typical would be: They take too long (usually needlessly fighting monsters); They misinterpret the overlord's behaviour and don't protect important characters/assets; They ignore explicit text they were told (Fridge!).
 2) The game may end without the investigators even knowing the goal of the game.
 3) Randomness can drastically screw the chances of the investigators/overlord resulting in a too easy / impossible game.

Overall a good game.

Provisional rating - I need to play it more!

Setup time seems a bit of a nightmare (which might be thematic, but I'd rather it was quicker)

Not sure how replayable the 5 scenarios will be, if they're not then it makes the game quite expensive as you have to keep investing in new expansions to get the next adventure [I'm sure there will be more ..]

Monster figures seem totally unneccessary, I'd rather have the chit on the map and reduce the clutter.

A Lovecraft dungeon crawl- it sounds awesome and it is.  Yeah there are some flaws in some of the scenarios, and early on there was a lot of errata and revisions.  But overall, I don't know that something like this could be done much better.  The production values are sky high and it tells a story maybe better than any other board game.  Not really as complicated as it looks, although your first couple plays might take a while.  I love the expandability too- really more a game system than a single game, which is something I love too.  Mostly replaced by app-driven second edition but it's cool that most of the components work in the new game.

Juego ambientado en el universo lovecraft. Los jugadores (salvo uno que hace de master o "keeper") son investigadores que llegan a la mansion y allí deben ir descubriendo pistas para determinar cuál es el objetivo que deben cumplir para ganar el juego. Cuando llegas a la casa no sabes qué hay que hacer para ganar. Es un juego en el que lo más cuidado ha sido la ambientación. Cada partida es una historia. El juego incluye unos cuantos escenarios y presumiblemente, se podrán incluir más. El jugador que hace de keeper es el que lleva el hilo del juego, maneja los eventos, etc. Es colaborativo y si ganan los investigadores, todos comparten la victoria por igual.
No es mi tipo de juego, pero reconozco haberlo pasado muy bien jugandolo. Es importante, como siempre, la implicación del resto de los jugadores para tener una experiencia plena.

Mansions of madness evokes the theme of Lovecraft's Cthulhu mythos even better than Arkham Horror I would say. Having never played Betrayel of the House on the Hill, I really liked the style of gameplay that MoM had to offer. The puzzles are interesting and the mechanics are easy to pick up. However, it is sad having to play against your friend(s), I'm not terribly fond of a 1 vs. everyone else setup in games (ala Descent), but the game is interesting, immersive and unlike anything else my gaming group has. It tends to be a little on the long side and is much longer if anyone playing is prone to AP. the more I've played this the less I like it.

This is a good thematic game.  It's more about the story and atmosphere than winning or losing.  Turn down the lights, light some candles, put on some dark music, and you've got an enjoyable evening.  Nice components and minis.  Love the way the board changes for each scenario.  Lots of Fiddly Rules (this is FFG) which I can see annoying many people.  Takes a long time to set-up and to play, which means my wife and I won't play much with little kids. Now my group has interest in it, and we're playing it more, and I like it even better. Definitely a keeper.

I'll start by saying that this sort of game really isn't the sort of game that my group and I like.  Merchants & Marauders, Ravenloft, Arkham Horror have all fell flat.

However, I can't help but like this game.  The combat simplicity is pretty nice, and the skill checks are done in a very simple manner with a single simple die.   So it actually feels pretty streamlined for a game of this type.  The theme is pretty accessible too (spooky house, ooooooOOoo...)

I would certainly play it again, although finding enough people to play it again with might prove to be difficult.

RATING: 8
I was almost afraid to play this.  I love Arkham Horror, but can't get into Elder Sign.  It looked as though they'd split AH into two games, the mechanics going to ES and the RP aspects going to MoM.  In fact, that's not far wrong.

This is NOT a roleplaying game, but it does synthesize the essence of RPG experience into board game form rather nicely.  It manages to hold on to theme (in a way that ES does not), but it does sacrifice the subleties of a real RPG.  (In fact, experienced roleplayers often have to told repeatedly "This is not a subtle game.")  If you get a clue, you need to follow it then and there, not wait for the right time.  If something is going on somewhere on the map you can't see, or the party is split up, you don't assume "fog of war" and pretend you don't know what's happening elsewhere.  

I'm pleased, if not totally convinced, by the quasi-replayability of the scenarios, but haven't had cause to try it out so far.  I suspect I'll wind up buying the expansions.  Still, I like the [i]feel[/i] of this game.  It's bite-your-nails tense, and full of those oh-man-we-are-so-dead moments as the Keeper picks up a handful of threat tokens and proceeds to surround the investigators with eldritch Bad Stuff.

Best part of all, for me: in 2-3 hours, I can have all the fun of running an RPG (well, most of it) without the hours of prep I would normally spend.  And that is awesome.

Ashar loooooves this one, and I must agree that in terms of theme, it is king.  Even Arkham Horror doesn't come as close as MoM to making every game a narrative with memorable moments and the feel of impending doom.  I'm less hot on it, probably because I am always the keeper.  Ah yes, narrative is fairly easy to come by when one person plays the DM...  So I have never had the satisfaction of uncovering the plot and facing the dread of the Old Ones.  The keeper is fun to play, no doubt, but also has a good amount of bookkeeping to do.  I'd rate this higher if the stories themselves were better.  Some have bitched about limited replayability, but that is not a big deal for me (unless you play it once a week, you'll still have months and months of play even with only 5 stories).  No, the real issue is that the stories are somewhat inconsistent.  A few feature one psycho, or one witch... while others feature everything from cultists all the way to ol' Soggy itself.  Playing a scenario with one or two baddies is just not that much fun, while scenarios with a ton of baddies are too top heavy.  More balancing would benefit this game.  We got some paint so we could paint these minis, but so far it has not happened yet.  Since Ashar refuses to let this game out of her iron grip, I'm sure it will happen eventually.

After 5 plays I'm dropping my rating to a 5.  It takes too long, has few meaningful decisions, is repetitive, and is generally much too difficult for the investigators until they've played the scenario a few times to know where things will be -- which isn't fun.  Plus thematically it is ridiculous, especially for the keeper: wound but don't kill investigators, get out of their way if the clock is running down and they haven't found the objective, etc.  As much as I want to love this game, it just doesn't work. 
====
I enjoy the theme and the bits are great but it takes longer to play than I like and there are some "rough edges" in some of the scenarios / rules that need to be house ruled.  My rating might go down over time as it seems like the puzzles will get "old" after a while and there are only 5 scenarios.  Hopefully FFG will publish more scenarios on their web site.

It does boggle the mind the prodigious quantity of crack that must have been smoked to have come to the conclusion that there was functional and interesting game in this box. There are nice miniatures. There is flavorful flavor text. There is nice art. All of that is good. There are some boring, repetitive, and athematic puzzles, plus a flavorful but insanely tedious combat resolution system. But there is no game. If I want flavor text I can read a book. If I play a game I want to make some meaningful decisions, and have a story of some kind evolve from those decisions. It doesn't have to be a lot - Castle Ravenloft works for me, especially at a touch over 1 hour - but there is nothing at all in evidence here, plus it runs 3-4 hours. Mansion of Madness is just a dungeon crawl, and a torturously bad one at that. Back when Battlestar Galactica came out, I had some hope for Corey Konieczka. He hadn't produced any professional-level games yet, but he seemed to be learning. But Mansions of Madness is complete amateur hour. It flagrantly violates too many basic rules and structures of game design. If the nice flavor text and art is enough for you - and for many people it is - more power to you. For me though, I do require an actual game.
---
Another truly horrendous rulebook from FFG. Whoever their rules editor is over there is in desperate need of being fired. Really, it boggles the mind. Rules-writing is not easy, but it's not rocket science either and it's nowhere near as difficult as they make it seem. I give GMT flak from time to time for their lousy rules - and believe me, they deserve it - but FFG is even worse. I failed my horror check about a third of the way through and let myself be taught.

RATING: 3
[floatleft][imageid=935943][/floatleft] [b]Mansions of Madness[/b] - [i]Mansions of Madness[/i] should feel intimately familiar for connoisseurs of the horror-RPG-inspired board game genre.  The game largely takes its cues from [i]Betrayal at House on the Hill[/i], but, for better and for worse, beefs up that model with additional complexity and then stretches the experience over hours rather than minutes (too be fair, I've been told that my two sessions of [i]Betrayal[/i] were atypically short).  Although the game contains some notable improvements over its predecessor, it also brings quite a few significant drawbacks to the table.  In most instances, the game's failures are a product of novel, well-intentioned ideas generating poor incentive structures for the players at the table.  Not surprisingly, then, I find the game both promising and nearly unplayable (by me; I'm inclined to think that this game would appeal to those who are already predisposed to like this sort of experience game).

Like [i]Betrayal[/i], [i]Mansions of Madness[/i] uses a one-against-many dynamic in which one player controls the monsters against which the other players are struggling.  In [i]Mansions[/i], however, only the evil player knows his objective from the very start of the game.  This information may not be revealed to the investigators for hours, during which time they wander around semi-aimlessly looking for clues.  

One of the big innovations of the game, of course, is the use of mission-specific clues (along with items and bad guys) to produce a coherent narrative throughout the adventure, rather than simply a string of random, open-ended encounters ("Oh look, I found a mysterious book...again.").  However, the clues are extremely heavy-handed, meaning that no real deduction or investigation is required.  For example, our first clue was "You smell something burning in the Kitchen"; the clue in the kitchen was "A trail of sooty footprints leads from the Kitchen to the Hallway."  The forced narrative often deprives you of real choices and makes you feel much less like an investigator and more like a pawn in some poorly constructed slasher movie.

The game exacerbates this sense of fatalistic determinism by locking essential clues behind doors that require special keys (usually only available at the site of the previous clue).  Wandering off alone is not only a bad idea in the general sense, but it is also usually a fruitless endeavor.  The game simply won't allow you to shortcut the story, which again means that the players are simply along for the ride.  

The key system actually has another substantial drawback.  By treating each key as an item, the game only functions if players work together to get the single player carrying the key into the right room to unlock the door to the next clue.  Yes, I realize that [i]Mansions[/i] is openly a cooperative game.  But the investigator's turn plays out in an unsettlingly Pandemic-like fashion with all players so concerned about hurting the team with an obviously bad choice that no one acts unless and until a consensus on the entire turn is reached.  So the overall feeling from the investigator's side becomes one of not really playing your own turn (due to the need for concerted action), followed by several minutes of downtime while the evil player spends a multi-step turn staring at cards that the investigators aren't allowed to see, spending a currency that the investigators don't have, moving monsters in asymmetrical and unpredictable ways while aiming for goals of which the investigators are not aware.

I want to be clear: I really did appreciate some of the game's innovations, but the game also felt like it was constantly stepping on its own toes with mechanics that slowed the pace and made the wrong trade-off between narrative and gameplay.  A great contrast here is the game's use of combat cards and skill points:

When you choose to attack a monster (or when one attacks you), the evil player flips through a deck of combat cards until he find one applicable to the situation (e.g., Sharp Melee Weapon vs. Monster).  The card then tells you how the encounter plays out, including any needed die rolls. The idea is that this allows each fight to have its own narrative and to proceed in slightly unpredictable ways.  It's not just the same-old "declare, roll, deal damage." But the emphasis on storytelling comes at the cost of meaningful decision-making and game flow. First, the flipping is time-consuming; by the third or fourth deck reshuffle, you start to wonder whether it is a worthwhile mechanic. Second, the card you draw determines any number of things, including which attribute you roll against and the damage you might deal or take.  A character with high Marksmanship wielding a gun and attacking a monster that it has been fighting in a closet for the last two turns might flip a card only to discover that the story has now decreed that she was trying to shoot while running and her attack will be tested against her low Dexterity instead.  Failing the roll, the gun blows up and the player takes damage. Because of such possibilities, the card deck essentially makes the decision whether to attack or evade a monster nearly incalculable, and again forces the narrative upon players rather than letting them generate it.

At the other end of the spectrum, the game gives each player "skill" chits that they can expend to improve die rolls. On the one hand, this seems like a great idea.  Players can accumulate these chits throughout the game and get "lucky" just when they need it the most. Very thematic. But the scarcity of the chits meant that the players at my table insisted on knowing all the possible outcomes of each roll before they decided whether this was a critical moment worthy of a chit.  Not only did reading out the options mean added downtime for the reading and0 added downtime for the player to conduct his/her risk-reward calculation, it also (and much more importantly) produced a break in the narrative that took me out of the game entirely. I hate, hate, hate hearing in advance that  you have a 60% chance that spooky noise you heard was nothing and you calmly walk away but a 40% chance that a zombie jumps out of the mirror, you panic and take two damage and a Horror point.   Here, the seemingly clever design seems to beg for informed decision making that results in the destruction of the narrative. (If I ever play games like this again, I will insist that roll-dependant outcomes are not read unless and until triggered by the roll, even though it makes things like Skill Points much less useful.)

The accumulation of so many minor-but-annoying design choices over such a lengthy game (ours ran 3+ hours and we quit with two turns still to go) became a bit much. One of the reasons I rated [i]Betrayal[/i] so highly is that it is a fun, 30-minute romp.  Over such a short timeframe, flaws are easy to ignore.  At about 1/7th the pace of my [i]Betrayal[/i] games,  "romp" is not an applicable word for [i]Mansions[/i].  By the end of the game, the things I found questionable so sufficiently outnumbered the things that I found redeeming about the design that I find myself unlikely to play again.  

It's a tantalizingly promising game, and one that I think could be interesting to the right players with the right experience and the right inter-personal dynamics. But it doesn't have enough going for it to survive a failure on any one of those criteria, let alone all of them.

I love love LOVE this game!  Arkham Horror with a much more story-driven interface that focuses on a more RPG-like aspect.  It's not high on replay value, despite what you may hear.  It's also a BEAST to setup (30-45 minutes, on average!).  The role of the Keeper is also a finnicky one, and difficult to master.  Despite any of that, I'm in absolute love with this game!

Side Note:  I had 3 of my Investigator figures falling of their bases upon acquiring my copy.  I emailed Fantasy Flight in hopes of receiving replacements for those pieces, and was pleasantly surprised when I received a full set of replacement investigator figures along with a handwritten thank you note.  This possibly secured my loyalty to Fantasy Flight for a LONG time to come!  :D

RATING: 6
Based on 1 play with 5 players:

VERY hard to rate this after just one play. Seems like things could vary dramatically based on the scenario. Rating is very, very tentative.

I REALLY like that Fantasy Flight is taking steps to make their games shorter and more streamlined. A definite step up from Arkham Horror in that regard.

The one thing that rubbed me the wrong way was how objectives get revealed. In Betrayal, I'm fine with having the first part of the game just be about exploration because you're constantly having interesting encounters or gaining equipment, etc., and it doesn't take that long for the haunt to begin. Here, an hour or two can go by before the investigators even figure out what their objective is... if they ever do at all. After awhile, it just feels like aimless wandering.

The theme is also a little bit of a letdown. It's fine, but for whatever reason I just didn't get the same level of immersion I found in both Arkham Horror and Betrayal.

On the plus side, taking a cue from Descent, the Keeper is a great addition. Having one player actively working against you makes things feel less random and more heated. And, compared to Arkham Horror, it takes away a lot of fiddliness from things like monster movement etc.

Oh - attacking is pretty neat. The deck of cards definitely makes things feel more themeatic compared to other games. Just worry that things might feel stale after you've seen most of the cards.

All in all, the jury is still out on this one.

Absolutely love this game. I play this game a lot with the wife with an automated keeper variant (available in the file section). Its basically a story driven game where the investigators explore a mansion but (at the start) do not know exactly what their objective is. As the game progresses clues appear and your goal slowly becomes clear. Since you are under constant attack by creatures and events it is a real nail biting experience. The game could definably use future (story) expansions to add to the re-playability. If you like games like descent and dig the horror (arkham horror) theme I highly recommend this game.

RATING: 9
This game is great.  I played it with a group of friends for the first time last night.

Setup was slow, but after that it was a rollercoaster of laughs and Cthulhu goodness.

Initially a few of the players were upset that I hadn't turned up with Cthulhu RPG which we used to play, but within the first few turns they were hooked.

The ability of the keeper to play trauma and mythos cards on the players kept up the role playing aspect nice.  When one player got the Kleptomaniac trauma, there others all started trying to avoid them lest they lost their favourite gear. 

Plus the monsters turned out nicely, a big manic kept turning up and terrorising one of the players who had also got hold of an axe and the fun never stopped.

Definatley a must for any ex Call of Cthulhu RPG players.

RATING: 4
Easy to play once you've experienced a few turns. Beautifully produced as you'd expect from FFG.

Only one play so far (Scenario 3). I think we got a rule wrong. An investigator was pushed through locked door with some essential item and then couldn't exit because no one could obtain the key which made it impossible to win that scenario. That was a bit disappointing plus my character (Joe Diamond) failed every attempt to shoot the various monsters and repeatedly dropped his weapons at every opportunity. Eventually he received a broken leg and he became even less fun to play. Hope future plays will be less frustrating and quicker now we've played once.

After a second play (Scenario 2): Gameplay smoother and a rather more successful investigator (Jenny Barnes). I find the back and forth nature of the trail of essential items required for the win rather annoying. In hindsight, it would be nothing short of a miracle to achieve it within the alloted number of moves.

RATING: 6
I painted the miniatures, and its FF so of course its easy on the eyes.  Setup time is prohibitive, and play time is sometimes prohibitive, sometimes surprisingly fast.  Scenarios are entertaining and have a nice variety of theme.

Experience with this game has been a real mix.  Investigators often feel that there is insufficient guidance, and that the challenge is insurmountable.  In several instances, this has been true.  Also possible is the investigator trudge, where the investigators journey is tedious and time consuming without being particularly fun or challenging.  The all star scenario can be a great deal of fun, with the investigators barely averting catastrophe at the eleventh hour.

I've only played the first three scenarios, but those multiple times.  It appears to me that the first is the most balanced, most likely to be the third type of experience listed above.  The second is either insurmountable or a trudge, and the third is merely barbaric in the horrors it perpetrates upon the protagonists.  This gives the appearance that only the first scenario was play-tested.

The components are great, as I would expect from FFG, however the chits are unending, and the rulebook lacks coherent organization.  This is all standard fare for FFG.

Overall I enjoy the game greatly, but feel guilty about dragging the group into a potentially 3-5 hour game which ends up being a great disappointment by the end.  It's too much of a gamble to try it out hoping to have a successful and gratifying experience.

Only "bad thing" was the lenght, the game itself took about 3 hours (first time) and the setup took about 2 hours but it was worth it. 

Next time i guess its gonna play quicker. Really looking forward for my next game with this game.

And the book of rules was great, that book alone is a 9/10

Setup time can kill me!  However, the game can give you a horror atmosphere!  The miniatures are pretty good, but the re-playability of the game appears to be minimal once you know the story and the locations of the clues. 
After playing the 2nd story, I can say the designer is great to put the tense feeling into the board game.

One of my favorites but it has its weaknesses, I like all the stories but some objective cards (different wining conditions) are bad-game disaster. Some times it can loose its story line (not so solid) BUT from the other hand when it plays as supposed to be is PERFECT! So, only some minor problems from the designer and not the final game as it is.

I would like to say I enjoy this game more than I do but there's just too many fixes that need to be implemented to make it fun.  Not that it's a horrible game by any means.  But it's hard to get to the table with my family, who is my main gaming group.  Excellent implementation of theme, one of the best games out there for this I believe.  And with the right group (with patience) this can be made to be an awesome experience.  Call of the Wild expansion is a must with this.

Bought largely for miniatures. Better to run a rpg (Call of Cthulhu, Realms of Cthulhu, Trail of Cthulhu) based on scenarios than the game itself.  The components work decently well for table top rpgs.  However, it is decent rpg in a box it you looking for a highly structured, light role-playing game.   Especially if all the players are new to the idea of pen and paper rpgs or don't have the time for a full campaign.

It has gotten a surprising large number of plays even though it does have a monster of a setup.  I don't think I will ever get a chance to be an investigator with it.  Its biggest problem is the shear amount of time it takes to setup and put away.  If you can get all of this work out of the way before the rest of the players show or while they are playing another game fine.

This is probably my favorite big-box, Ameritrash-style game, because it's so narrative based. I assume that once I've played through all the scenarios at least once, it'll lose some appeal, but for now I've really enjoyed it each time (I've only played as the keeper so far.)

I've had mixed experiences with Mansions of Madness, but the general trend is toward the positive.  Initially, playing mainly as the keeper with one person playing multiple other characters - it just felt overwhelming.  I've never been a fan of the situational sham cards, as also seen in Android.  They just require too much juggling in my mind, and make the flow feel halting.  But, I do like the theme and the variety of mysteries that can be solved.  The production values are also excellent.  So, I do look forward to playing more, and I think it will get run through its paces, although probably not arising to the level of something like Arkham Horror.

The only issue I have with Mansions, at least as far as the first printing of the base set (I'm no expert on all the new offerings), but at that time they couldn't decide whether the villain was an impartial DM telling a story or a player trying to be as cutthroat as possible. I only played this game once as the villain, and the heroes kept getting mad at me for being alternately too hard and too easy. That's a question that requires clarity, and it's not just a shame that Fantasy Flight refused to answer it at the time, it actually broke the game. I want to say I've heard it's better now, and that question was finally answered. Certainly, it was my only fault with this otherwise splendid purchase. The puzzles alone, and the mechanic where your number of turns is based on your character's intelligence score, are revolutionary for a board game.

I have just recently picked up this game and it's amazing in every way. Being a H. P. Lovecraft enthusiast and having played Arkham Horror for years, Mansions of Madness is something new and challenging. It's Lovecraft's world from a very different, personal view. I really appreciate what the designer has achieved with this game. The system is clever and well-thought, the scenarios are great, the components are what you can expect from FFG. 
In my group I regularly take the role of the keeper and it's a fun. It's a reminiscent experience of being the DM in a role playing game, but at the same time it's different, because this is a board game.
I really like this game, it's an other step towards this dark Lovecraftian world.

Hmmm... Interesting game. Quite a bit of setup for what you get perhaps and I've heard concerns about the balance between an experienced keeper and the investigators. But my one game with 4 first time players against a first time keeper went right down to the wire which is what you want I guess. Ultimately, though I have to wonder why I wouldn't just play the Call of Cthulhu RPG...

RATING: 3
Big old box of goodies. 

Despite this, the game is clunky and does not reward the players for exploring/role-playing. Frankly, the Keeper has to play and set up perfectly or the game just won't work. Set up and tear down is ridiculous. I'd recommend just running one off games of the Call of Cthulhu RPG by Chaosium.

RATING: N/A
 Mansions of Madness provided for countless memories that became some of the best lines, moments, and memories of 2011. Based on the rich Cthulhu Mythos, each play through tells a horrific story that could be written as a short story to account for every move, decision, and challenge that faces the investigators. Even after numerous play throughs, the Mansion continues to introduce new secrets, items, challenges, puzzles, traumas, insanities, enemies and more. The game also successfully creates an amazing and horrific atmosphere - even when the investigators find weapons and powers, there is constantly a sense that they could lose, go insane and turn against their friends, or be killed at any time. Just as players begin to abandon hope, they can often win in the final moments of the game, creating an epic climax that leaves the everyone thrilled - and occasionally ready to start over and play again. The game creates a cooperative environment for players, but also gives them a thinking, evil, unpredictable, human foe to overcome.

If you took a typical D&D set-up, mixed in all the story and atmosphere of Arkham Horror, and then simplified the whole experience, you would have Mansions of Madness.

The set-up and rules explanation for this game can be very lengthy, so I'd recommended you play with an experienced keeper that's already set up the game.  Because the actual gameplay moves along quickly, and if the players get really involved there isn't even much downtime.

The potential issue is replayability, but Corey Konieczka has cleverly added multiple story possibilities within each main story.  I do, however, think once you're keeper for a story, it would be hard not to feel spoiled for future iterations of that story.

Expansion potential is big here, and I expect we'll be seeing more stories in the near future.

A wonderfully crafted game that uses story as the main driving element to guide the investigators through the eldritch mystery of their environment.

Fail: Hear enough long sighs of investigators waiting to say, "We can play another game...")

Fantastic components. Good tension as you explore the mansion. I liked the mini-games. The game doesn't seem to be balanced well though. The evil player needs to play more like a GM. If the evil player could be automated using some kind of A.I. which could dynamically balance it to how well the investigators are doing, it could be a fun fully cooperative game. Overall though, I'd much rather play Eldritch Horror because it is fully cooperative.

Great game - the narrative unfolding is good fun to watch when playing as the keeper.  Although having such a reliance on the narrative means repeat plays are not so open ended as Arkham Asylum, therefore making the expansions a must for continued longevity.  Hugely enjoyable game.  Great set of miniatures too.  Good value package.

Low rating due to having played it only as a detective. Maybe playing it as the keeper would be more fun. As a detective, it is a long and boring wait for the end. Just a single path to the solution, no plan b, totally randomic system, one detective gets the clue and he must go to the other clues, the other detectives must watch and can't do nothing, the keeper is way overpowered, he can move you around the map just as he almost wants. Played 4 different scenarios, but it is the same.

Only played it once, it really needs to hit the table more. The experience we had was amazing- however it is a lot of work for the Keeper to set up (and not make any game-breaking mistakes before you even start playing) and the scenarios in the base game are not particularly complete. You can get a superb RPG-in-a-box experience out of this, but you do need to put in the leg work and download some fan-made embellishments to get the most out of it

A game, like Arkham Horror, that I wanted to like much more than I did.  The production is wonderful and very atmospheric, and it looks great set up, especially with the painted miniatures I spent so much money on. In play I felt that the adventures needed to be a bit more elaborate--they just didn't have the oomph I was looking for. The puzzles were simple and while a neat idea just didn't really work after a few plays. The amount of set up time was also an issue, and the game would break if you made a mistake in putting it together. In all, a nice try but not quite there. 

Second Edition hits the mark! Highly recommend it over this. Only keeping this around for parts.

RATING: 10
It's really a great game if your looking for some Lovacrafting RPG-lite gaming. The scenarios, which make it, are generally on point and really give you a feel of the Lovecraftian atmosphere. There are a few that are a little lackluster, you can find the reviews online to weed out the bad scenarios.

My group played regularly, we went through about 8-10 sessions of the game and we still want to go back for the expansion that I picked up. One suggestion is start off with he first one to get your bearings of the game, the game will last a couple of hours. Also there is a lot of set up involved. I would generally prepare the night before and get everything organised so that I could reduce the set up time when game night came along. Reason why that set up is so long is due to the fact that each room has item cards associated to it. These cards are placed specifically there to guide the player to the clues and help them solve the mystery so sorting through all the cards and separating them for each room takes some time. This job is left to the keeper to keep the scenario secret form the investigators, taking some time. 

With that all said we had a blast with the game and if you have the time and a good group it is definitely worth the investment.

RATING: 4
I guess I just don't really appreciate the Mythos theme as much as others.  If it were a good game, I could overlook that.  It's merely an okay game.  Maybe an introductory game as a stepping stone to Descent: Journeys in the Dark.  It has the same feel, but plays in a shorter time.  

Another thing I disliked was the linear path of exploration.  The heroes must obtain certain "keys" in order to unlock another part of the mansion.  So, it's not as if the heroes can truly go exploring on their own.  

Furthermore, the die-rolling is frustrating when you don't roll well.  My character learned a spell, and despite using a Skill Token prior to casting, I never (in 3 attempts) rolled a successful attack with it (only needed a 7 or below).  

Finally, I appreciate their attempt to make the creatures' information easy to spot on their bases, but the figures took up way too much space on the board.  It would have been better to have smaller figures and a cheat sheet for the players with the monsters' attributes.  

My love of Ameritrash seems to be more geared for the epic-level games and less so for the smaller-scale, tactical, mini-games such as this one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very much a story driven game with some tactical miniature gameplay. I really like the components, the two-step combat of card draw and dice test (despite the added length, the theme is worth it), and the scenarios. I do not feel the bread crumb/clue based scenario progression is too linear and I feel the setup adds enough randomness to keep it interesting.

Investigators will be on the losing end more often than not since the Keeper has more access to information and scenarios can end abruptly for how long the game plays and the long setup. That being said, the atmosphere of the game pulls me through any imbalances so far.

Setup is really lengthy though.

Got this in 2011 and it became one of our favorite games to play with a smallish group of players.  I've always played as the Keeper.  At first I took it pretty easy on the investigators and lost a few of the first games.  Lately I've had a much higher win ratio since I've been going a bit harder on them.  Because of the long setup and tear-down time, this game doesn't get as much table time as some other 'easier' games.

Initial plays haven't gone that well, and a second look at the game when MoM:FA was launched - which I bought sight unseen, due to my obsession with FFG's take on Lovecraft - stalled when I realised what an unholy mess FFG had made of the expansion.

Played a full game at a demo event. So amazingly thematic and streamlined. Can't wait till it comes out.

Edit: Have since changed my opinion. Feels like a giant luckfest. Stories don't have too much to do with the gameplay, a lot of the time finding clues is too slow and doesn't grant much advantage. Setup time is painfully slow.

Incredibly involved for this kind of game, but incredibly fun and full of flavour.  The character creation is also a nice touch.

Waiting forever for your turn, and then just walking, for multiple turns in a row, is a real drag.

A "3" means "Likely won't play this again, although could be convinced.  Bad."  I don't think I'll ever be convinced to play this again.  There are simply too many other great games out there.  But rating this lower than a 2 just didn't seem right.

A story driven RPG lite romp in the Cthulhu universe. Plays shorter than Arkham and it does provide a more consistent narrative than Arkham Horror, however it still plays a little clunkily and mechanistically - typical of FFG. The plot's of the scenario's I played were pretty simplistic and just not quite detailed enough to really come to life - casting one player in the role of the DM is a bit wasted as the player runs the monsters in combat rather than the plot.

Concerned about the replayability - they need to bring out more scenarios and hopefully these won't be too expensive - print and play (with a download charge) would be acceptable for me.

In the end just wasn't as much fun as Arkham Horror and that linked to the replayability issue - SOLD

Did think about keeping this just for the floor plans of creepy houses and cellars and the like which are excellently realised and could easily be used in other games.

Another experience game from FFG. It plays more like Descent than Arkham Horror but somehow it felt like I didn't have many meaningful choices, there was more or less always an obvious choice what to do each turn. All the recycling of art and characters from AH feels a bit weird, isn't this a standalone game?

Fun once in a while.

The production qualities of the game is great, nice and detailed characters figures for example.

I think that years of tinkering have finally paid off for FFG. Starting with clumsy Talisman-style games like Arkham Horror, they have tried out lots of variations: Doom, Descent, Android, and Middle-Earth Quest. As these evolve FFG has been keeping the things that work and tossing out the nonsense. 

Mansions of Madness is the best yet of its type. It's a clean and zippy iteration on the old Sorcerer's Cave/Black Morn Manor series. It does a great job in narrative. The sub-systems keep it from becoming boring, but are not distracting. The first one I can really recommend!

A haunted house game in which one player is the diabolical Mansion Keeper, intent on destroying the minds and bodies of the other players.

As their injuries mount and sanity slips away, the Keeper can inflict horrible physical and mental trauma on them.  Absolutely outstanding game.

This game is a great way to get that Arkham fix in less time with much less rules burden.  I love that really only the Keeper needs to have a firm grasp of the rules.  The other players only have to deal with choosing from a few options, so the game can get underway very quickly, assuming that the setup has already been done.  The scenario-based gameplay is a nice complement to the random experience of the full Arkham Horror game (or Betrayal at House on the Hill) and I will be lucky if I play it enough to get bored with the included scenarios.

UPDATE Jul 2016
This is a nice design, and I think superior to Betrayal at House on the Hill thanks to its more prescripted, but still variable narrative.  The problem I have with it is one of personal taste.  Because it is so much about the story, as the keeper I just can't bring myself to play my hardest.  I WANT to investigators to succeed, so I can't really enjoy playing the bad guy.  I think maybe the new co-op version might be more to my liking.

I welcomed the chance to play [thing=83330][/thing] as an Investigator, after playing only once before as the Keeper.

Admittedly, I generally do not enjoy asymmetric games, and this one, well, reinforced my dislike.

For a "themed adventure game" with role-play elements, it is far too linear for my liking.  The stories are written point-to-point, with no chance of deviation if you hope to win.  There is no creativity needed to play the game - only lucky dice rolls.

As such, my rating has dropped from a 6.5 (when I first played as the Keeper) to 5.5 (after playing as an Investigator for 3 hours in a 5 player game).

Wow! First played it as part of our groups Halloween themed session, all were very impressed.

I also own, and the same group plays Descent 2nd ed. (also from FF, also features 1 evil player versus 1+ good players, also designed by/with Corey Konieczka) and have to say MoM feels much more balanced and clearer cut to play.
Plus MoMs theme, mission stories and Keeper involvement felt much stronger/more satisfying because they are better interwoven into play.
Comparing being a Keeper in MoM to an Overloard in Descent 2nd ed: I found the Keepers effectiveness and general involvement felt much more rewarding and equal to Investigators.

Still very impressed, definitely in my top 5 fave games.

Not a prefect game by any stretch of the imagination. And as I mature as a gamer I realize I don't need perfect games, I just need games that are easy to teach and get into, atmospheric and entertaining. That's what this is. Some say RPG it. Some say ease up as the Overlord. I just say play the damn game, have fun and place more emphasis on the experience rather than the end outcome...People remember fun, they enjoy fun. They also remember, in not so fond terms, games where they get beat down, games where they get annoyed, all because someone wants to win as the Overlord at all costs. I just wish I played as something other than the Overlord.

●2011 released. I simple need another ameritrash game. Most probably will wait and see how it went after the released. 
●It's from FFG and the the figures are fantastic in the game.
●Update1: Friend is getting. Will try his copy before deciding the purchase.

Comment Update:
Played friend's copy.

Very heavily thematic, which I love, flavour text flooded the game pretty much everywhere. The game has text, but not too much like in Last Night on Earth. Another thing I like more when compared with LNoE is that there is less bookkeeping in MoM. I seriously adore this.

In LNoE, seems like there are too many cards or event that modify a certain value which require players to always refer to and remember. I just hate it sometimes. The same problem occurs in Castle Ravenloft and Conquest of Planet Earth.

In MoM, battle happens super quick and test on your abilities is done with the roll of a die, super quick as well. Only gripe, the puzzle can be a deal breaker sometimes. If I'm in the mood, it can be fun, but once I have too many puzzles to solve, it can be daunting.

●Friend owns it
●Decided not to buy as it seems impossible to get played unless in my gaming group (but for sure my friend who owns it will bring it).

While I will likely never own this game myself (because omg the amount of STUFF you have to take care of), I absolutely adore this game.  Not only do you have some really cool Cthulhu Mythos as your backdrop, but you have this amazing interactive experience and the Keeper isn't just a standby, guiding you on your journey; they are actually working against you at every possible turn.

The very fact that the game is designed in such a way that the Keeper is competitive with the players without being unfair makes MoM such a wonderful game, and more importantly, helps to develop a great narrative every time.  Sure, it can get old hat if you know all the scenarios, but rest assured that FFG will never stop putting new ones out.  I am always up for this game!

Mansions of Madness has a very interisting theme. The possibility of playing through stories based the Lovecraft's world is awsome. However, the game is completely broken. Is very  easy to the keeper to win. And, even if the keeper plays as a dungeon master focused on trying to make an enjoyable game for everybody, the lack of possibilities in some of the stories makes it very difficult. In one of the stories your only option is summoning and reraising a maniac during all the time. The number of modifications you need to make to have the boardgame working is very high and have made me very disappointed. I'll sell my boardgame and use the money to get a better boardgame.

This game is between a boardgame and a role playing game. In my opinion, this game is just fantastic to easily play an RPG withtout the needed preparation. Material, design, thee, stories, scenarios are great. Very good game !

Moreover, you can find a lot of variants on BGG that improve the game.

Intenta llevar una partida de chúlu al tablero, su principal problema es que puede pecar de una corta vida, con solo 5 historias y 3 combinaciones de cada una. Pero se pueden hacer aventuras, aunque requiere mucho más trabajo que lo deseable para un juego de mesa.

La primera partida no salió mal, pero esta última se hizo eterna. Terminamos todos agobiados de juego XD

Man, this one was incredibly tough to rate.  We don't actually own it, so each time we've played, our friend has been the keeper and selected the scenario.  

Let me start with what I like about the game. Thematically, the game looks awesome and is pretty fun to play.  My husband is an excellent role-player (while I am quite terrible), so the game gets silly pretty quick as I try to keep up with him.  For the type of game it is, it plays in roughly the right amount of time (3 hours or so).  

Now, I orignally thought this game to be an 8 or so and was considering getting it for our collection.  But here's my issue:  I've played 3 scenarios and had a pretty bloody awful time on two of them.  Opinions are divided as to what went wrong.  My husband feels some of the scenarios are just designed poorly.  We played one last night that basically punished us for doing well.  My team had moved through three quarters of the board before the objective was revealed (get to the starting location before the last event) and because of this, we did not have enough time to backtrack.  I was fine with losing, and I didn't think the scenario was that 'terrible'.  

I think our bigger issue is shotty play by the keeper.  I know mistakes will be made, but we've had issues with wrong equipment being randomized, improper monster decks attacking us, horror checks all but forgotten, you name it.  When you go through the trouble to play a 3 hour long 1 vs all game, it drives me absolutely batty when the one doesn't take the time to do it right.  I really think this game would be better if someone else in my group gave it a go as keeper.

RATING: 5
This had so much potential but ultimately failed.  What are some of the issues I have with it?  I consider it way more fun and interesting to be the Keeper than an Investigator.  The worst aspect is the extremely long setup for the game.  It's not something that can be rushed either as if one mistake is made then it may not be possible for the investigators to win.  There also seems to be a lack of replay value with this game even though the 5 scenarios can be played out in slightly different ways.  

I can finally understand why some video reviewers say that they only bother to make video reviews for games that they like.  Why waste the energy into going into depth about why you disliked a game.  If you dislike a game, forget it and move onto something else.  Now normally I don't mind trying to articulate what I disliked when the game is fresh in my mind, but it was about 2 months ago that I played this, so unfortunately, this is all you get.  I'll try to be more diligent with updating in the future.

fantastic game and probably the best Horror House "simulation" so far. It's not a Euro, it's not strategic - it's about reading flavor text and getting into the story. Highly recommended to any horror fans and Call of Cthulhu addicts. The only reason I don't give a 10 is the limited replay value of the scenarios (compared to "Betrayal at House on the Hill"), but I am sure Fantasy Flight will remedy this soon...

Seems fun. We tried to out think the game and failed as it's simple, a clue is clear, not tricky. My main complaint and the reason I'm not bothered about playing the game again, is that you drop weapons all the time! Way too easily. I spend half my actions picking up my weapon as I thought throwing my melee weapon was a good idea, three times, as an unarmed old man!?!?!

RATING: 6
Good physical quality, but suffers from typical problems arising from the attempt to make a role playing game into a board game: loads of fiddly bits, weak plot development and creativity bounded or restricted by card text.  That said, can be fun with the right group.  Play time seems a bit long for the fun value; the game overstays its welcome by about 30-60 minutes.  Overall, I'd prefer to simply play the Call of Cthulhu RPG.  Coming back to the game after a long hiatus, I find the review I wrote then expresses exactly my feeling now.

Una grossa delusione.
Molto belli i materiali, l' idea è sicuramente buona, l' ambientazione è resa bene ma nonostante questo il gioco vero è proprio non decolla: un setup monstre che non è però gratificato dall' esperienza di gioco. Non c' è vera sfida, gli investigatori sono sballottati sulla mappa, le azioni sono quasi obbligate, i mini giochi sono carini la prima volta ma già dalla seconda sono noiosissimi.
Di contro il Custode deve camminare sulle uova tra il divertimento del gruppo e la sua voglia di vittoria.
Non emerge mai un aspetto strategico e anche quello tattico è ridotto all' osso.
Anche l' investigazione non da mai quel senso di collegare gli indizi e risolvere il mistero ma solo "troviamo prima o poi la carta che da qualche parte è nascosta e vediamo quale altra carta cercare..." Railroading all' ennesima potenza.
Non nego che qulache gruppo possa trovarlo un ottimo gioco ma nel mio ha floppato alla grande.
Strizza l' occhio al gdr ma non ne raggiunge le vette di libertà interpretativa e decisionale e di contro gli aspetti da gdt (strategia, tattica, competizione) sono enormemente "diluiti".

RATING: 8
This is an imperfect game that I enjoy if played differently than originally intended. That is, I enjoy the game with a solo/coop mode variant made by a fan (kittenhoarder) or by playing more as a DM and less as someone trying win a game. 

The reason being, I firmly believe that a Lovecraftian game should be cooperative and not competitive because once you introduce a competitive situation, the theme of inevitable madness, chaos, and futility underlying the genre goes out the window because people want to win for the sake of winning and the enjoyment of the hopelessness of the theme goes out the window. It shouldn’t get anywhere near that but rather everyone enjoying when things going horribly wrong. 

I’m an avowed fan of Lovecraft (see my article, [blogpost=27416][/blogpost]), so I’m inclined towards the material. What I really like here is how they made the scenarios true mysteries. As an investigator, you don’t even know what the victory condition is until well into the game. You’re just walking into a creepy house and searching around and having scary stuff happen to you. You might very well die. Can’t argue it’s not thematic!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
there are tons of things in the box...the Lovecraft theme is far stronger here than in Arkham Horror and the session time is more managable.

Set-up time from a cold start is quite long and very specific, but that is to the benefit of future replay of the 5 scenarios.

Both the Investigators and the Keeper need to stay "in character" reading the flavor text to tie all of the things going on here in context of the story.

two annoying things...the repeated Horror checks for monsters can get tedious, and the combat deck "draw till you match your attack type" is clunky at best.

Overall not bad, Still prefer Witch of Salem when I crave the end of everything, but Masions of Madness does deliver on its premise.

NOTE: If you want to get the most mileage out of this one; DON"T READ THE CARDS WHEN YOU ARE NOT PLAYING...they are "things man was not meant to know."

An amazing story driven game that it took me over a year to learn and play. I wish I had done it faster.

Great puzzle solving aspect, fantastic story driven clues to each adventure and really scary if you get it right. The miniatures and production values are top notch. It takes a long time to set up, but its always worth it.

Every time I play it there is some other new gaming story comes out of it. Fantastic stuff. This could well be my new favorite game.

RATING: 5
After two games in which I and my fellow investigators were handed our brains in a skillet, I must say I find the game to be unbalanced towards the "GM".  I much prefer Arkham Horror where there are far more opportunities to advance rather than being forced to get one clue that is being guarded by every single monster the GM can summon in the way.

If the Overlord player messes up game setup it could mean the game is essentially unplayable.

RATING: 9.5
This is one of my highest-rated games, but we rarely get to play it. I would love to write up a full review once we get to 20 plays, but I fear that will take an eternity. The setup time on this is lengthy, but the nature of the game requires a complete play in a single session, just so the atmosphere (which, admittedly, is a huge part of the game) is maintained. 

Factor in work schedules and a rowdy 2-year-old and this game doesn't hit the table as often as it should.

We do play with the revised cards available in the BGG file section.

The flavour text in this game is amazing. I like that the flavour text on the clues gives you hints (however subtle) as to where the next clue is. 

Its also a shame that there are only 5 missions in the base game although they should be releasing print-on-demand scenarios soon *crosses fingers*. I also like that there is some variation in each of the missions dependent upon what the monster player picks.

Overall a very nice game that plays well if you have the right group. This is not the game for those that want to go around and kill monsters and the set-up time is quite long and a bit fiddly.

[b]The Fall of House Lynch:[/b] Unplayed.

[b]The Inner Sanctum:[/b] Unplayed.

[b]Blood Ties:[/b] Unplayed.

[b]Classroom Curses:[/b] Nice story driven mission but very little combat which is a shame as you find a lot of weapons in this mission.

[b]Green-eyed Boy:[/b] Really nice mission where the story is interesting and the clues are quick and easy to come by. They make sense i.e. the butler takes your coat and you find the first clue in the coat room. Unfortunately really dislike the hidden traitor card in this particular mission.

B&B/purchased 2010/arrived 2011

The box says 2-5 players, and strangely enough we played the first game with 6 because we misread the box.  The next game was played with 5, and all those involved said there was no difference between playing with 5 or 6.

9 different people played the two games tonight, and this is what they had to say:   
[b]Everyone liked the game (myself least of all)[/b].  Everyone said they would be up for more games, and I have been asked to bring it again next gaming night.  I will play it if someone pulls it out, but I will not suggest it myself.  

[b]Excluding my rating, everyone put it in the 6-8 (out of 10) range.[/b]  Those who have played Arkham Horror, agree AH is a better game, more complicated and with more options than Mansions of Madness.   MoM is a good gateway game to Arkham Horror.

One friend who played the Keeper in both games tonight, has played many games of  both Descent and Arkham Horror, said that Mansions of Madness is a mix of the two.  He rated Mansion of Madness an 8 out of 10.  

Positive comments by the players:  Lots of  re-playability, like the forced ending that keeps the game within reasonable time limits, favorably impressed that draws are possible, interesting looking, love the miniatures, and enjoy the story line.

Negative comments:  Too finicky,  puzzles not hard enough,  didn't get to do enough in the game, needs an organizer for the components, daunting rulebook if never played this type of game before.  I seemed to be the only one who objected to the downtime between turns.  The time I got to play compared to the length of this 2-3 hour game, was a very small ratio.  I didn't care about the story line, which held the interest for others.

I took an entire afternoon to just punch, bag, and label the numerous different kinds of tokens, tiles, cards, and miniatures.  I glued the figures to the bases and after play switched the baggies for organizing containers for the many components. 

I am keeping the game, but I will not be buying the expansions which are sure to follow--which is unusual for me.  I am just not that big a fan of this genre of game.

A very fun and thematic game. I don't get this game out as much due to the long setup and tear down times, which is something my group isn't that tolerable of. However, if I get this game setup before people arrive, they usually enjoy it
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Most thematic game I've played

Pros
-I can easily sell this game to any player and get them interested/hooked on the theme alone (and as a plus, it's extremely easy to teach, each player basically gets 2 move+1 action and has to walk around and search for clues)
-Immersive with the right group of people (lots of flavor text helps), and a real sense of mystery (even how players win the game are a mystery to all except the keeper)
-Very cool use of physical puzzle pieces to resolve certain events (e.g. unlocking a door requires you to rotate or swap adjacent tiles until it matches)
-Generally high quality components
-Numerous scenarios (still retains high replayability due to variations within a story). Players can also create their own scenarios with the map tiles/cards

Cons (pre-expansion) 
-Somewhat limited use of clues (in guiding players to the objective)
-Questionable balance of some character abilities and design on some cards
-Game is not faithful to source material (monsters have general abilities, do not relate to their literary counterparts in terms of abilities or special powers)
-Some annoying monster miniature which easily fall off their bases (bases are swappable) unless you glue them down
-Variable scenario quality
-Chance of finding nothing is fairly high when exploring (remedied in expansion)
-Chance to break the game in some rare situations (e.g. you break and discard the key you need to proceed in the game or the person you need to kill is moved out of the game through some other means and is no longer available)
-Limited replayability in the long term with provided scenarios
-Some gamers may not enjoy the theme and the lack of a clear objective
-Long game length
-Physical puzzle can results in long downtime for players not involved

RATING: 7
Looks like I guessed correctly how the "Keeper" mechanics work with respect to scenarios. It's far closer to my ideal of emergent coherent narrative than alternatives.

Some of the scenarios are lazily written and constructed, but I like the design theme of having encounters with unknown effects and unknown stats. The Keeper's interrupt play can be very annoying and drag out the game though.

RATING: N/A
Alas, here be a game that did not live up to the hype. I am a big fan of "Betrayal at House on the Hill" and was expecting "Mansions of Madness" to be _the game_ to make me replace it. This was not to be the case. I feel that "Mansions of Madness" is too theme dependent to make it a game I would enjoy playing again and again, as the threat is always the same and I always know who my enemy is (the Keeper player). 

With "Betrayal", I never know who to trust until that pivotal moment in the game where the betrayer is revealed and there are so many more scenarios that make the game feel bigger and better.

I'd play the game again, but I won't be looking to add it to my collection.

Our group tried and tried to play this. Somewhere in here is a decent game (a 6 or 7), but unless this is the only game you play and you can memorize every little thing you, are going to get something wrong and ruin the experience. Whether it be in the specific scenario you are trudging through or general game rules something is going to break and unlike a paper and pen RPG the system is too rigid for satisfying quick fixes that seem fair.

Case in point, one time the game, after spending an half an hour setting the adventure up, ended in two turns because of the way it was set up. Investigators entered a room that was only a couple spaces from where they started and it ENDED the game. This followed several looks to see if something was set up wrong and behold, that was just one of the ways that it could be set up and the Keeper's choices put it there. Ended in 15 minutes. We didn't touch the game for a long time after that.

The straw that broke the camel's back was when there seemed to be no way to get to areas because a item specific to the adventure had no clear way to be used. The Keeper scoured to rulebook for the answer only to find well after we gave up that it was in the set up in a tiny paragraph that was overlooked. So yes, it was totally our fault for missing it, but why wasn't there more indicated on the card. I mean really, why did everything have to be that clunky.

Really the time and effort you have to put into this thing and the satisfaction you get out of it, even if it "works" and you see it to the end is negligible; you just never really end up having fun.

We play a wide variety of "heavy" games, most of which I'd rather be playing.

I should sooooo love this game.  I only played the school scenario, but here's the rundown...

Components: EXCELLENT!  Especially with the painted minis the game owner subbed in.

Theme: Not my favorite.  Not really a fan of horror, less so of Cthulu.  However, I am a big fan of games that tell a story, and it does do that.  It does a better job than most games that try to tell a story.

Game play:  Ugh.

In theory, I should love this.  RPG-like game with unique characters running around picking up stuff to work together to solve a problem.  Sounds like something that's exactly what I'm looking for.

In practice, it was like spending 3 hours watching somebody try to drag a key down a hallway because the keeper kept pushing him back over and over and then he got too stupid to find a door.  Multiple times.  In 3 hours, the extent of my combat experience was throwing holy water at a monster one time.  I learned to cast spells at monsters but never had a chance to use it.  I had tons of boosts to my skill checks that I never had the opportunity to use.

To top it off, at the end neither side reached the goal and the game was unspectacularly declared a tie.  (Or 'both lose' - whatever.  Same thing.)

It did have the feel of a narrative... but in a shaggy dog story type way.  Left me torn between "I should so love this game" and "This is so painful." 

I've rated it a 3.5 based partially on the components.  Gameplay alone was a 2.

Everyone else said this scenario was the worst they'd played and it was a lot better than this, but it was so bad that it's going to be tough to get me to try it again.  Given the number of other great games that are out there...

An intense, moody, story generating game. There are decisions to be made, but the story far exceeds the game. I have not read the rules or acted as GM, but I enjoyed my play as an intrepid investigator.

A bit different from Fantasy Flight but sticking to the Arkham Horror line with this game where one person is running the game like the Call of Cthulhu/Trail of Cthulhu RPG and the rest are there to uncover the mystery of the scenario before they all are injured or insane. 

A little more fixed than Arkham Horror/Eldritch Horror as the scenarios in this have limited runs before the players know what to do but the variation happens with the GM being light or heavy with her/his cards of malice as well as the rolls of the dice the players get. A great horror game but give it a try before buying as it might not be the style of other people who like games that are more cooperative for everyone at the table like Arkham Horror/Eldritch Horror.

Love the Cthulhu theme, with the brutality and horror.   Overall a really neat game, but it is not perfect, here are some of the reasons why:

- The die hates you sometimes, and the keeper might be a bit overpowered at some scenarioes.
- Played it once with a group of 3 investigators, where one of the investigator didn't like the game, and that made the game experience so bad, it is REALLY IMPORTANT to have the right group of people!
- I got all expansions and thats alot of cards and bits to keep track of.
- Setup time can be very long.

Nice ideas, but somehow failing in execution. Competitive and storytelling aspects don't work well together, and the most frightening thing about Horror/Sanity is how many rolls you have to make.

I was honestly surprised how much fun this game is.  I am a fan of Betrayal at House on the Hill and I was afraid this would be a similar game with a much higher rules overhead.  Turns out the the rules are pretty manageable for the investigators.  Its feels very RPG-like.  A fine investigative story.  The downside is whether or not there is any real replayability.  I expect that there will be many expansions to follow.  As for production, it is the normal high quality FFG production.  There are a number of shoddy errors on cards which really should have been caught prior to printing.  The plastic minis are outstanding.

An interesting mix of puzzle and action style of miniature board game. In one sense it's a cross between Cluedo and Doom.

Plenty of potential but does require the maximum amount of players to fully get the most out of it.

Currently though I haven't been able to do just that for now.

My favourite thing about this game is the immersive theme and spooky mood, makes for a great Halloween game. Once setup the game runs smoothly enough, giving a lot of roleplay possibilities which, in my opinion, is the added value of this game.
Playing time is usually between 2 and 3 hours, but can take longer if the characters interact a lot with each other.

Downside might be prep time, which takes a bit too long for a boardgame, though much less than an actual RPG.

Overall a great gaming experience, mixing a boardgame with immersive RPG elements.

I feel I need to clear something up about the replayability of this game.

Story 1:
 
3 questions = 3 diffrent objectives, 4 diffrent ways the house can be seeded, 12 possible combos (not including the random seeding).
 
Story 2:
 
4 questions = 3 diffrent objectives, 8 diffrent ways the house can be seeded, 24 possible combos (not including the random seeding).
 
Story 3:
 
5 questions = 3 diffrent objectives, 16 diffrent ways the house can be seeded, 48 possible combos (not including the random seeding).
 
Story 4:
 
4 questions = 3 diffrent objectives, 8 diffrent ways the house can be seeded, 24 possible combos (not including the random seeding).
 
Story 5:
 
6 questions = 3 diffrent objectives, 32 diffrent ways the house can be seeded, 96 possible comobos(not including the random seeding).
 
 
 
This is if you play with the same group and only one person is the keeper each time.  If you are properly mixing up questions/stories each time you play, I seriously doubt you will ever reach the point where you "know the mansion by heart".  
 
Every clue has 2 possible locations it can be determined by if you anwers questions 2-3,4,5,6 A or B.  Combined that with the 'chart' above (First question determines objective (A, B or C), questions after that determine clue locations.
 
I don't really see a group memorizing that any time soon.  Granted, if you keep picking the same story + questions (keep a list of what you have done so far) they will grow used to the flavor text and story and start to learn quickly where each thing is, but if you mix it up properly this should not happen unless your playing this back to back extremely often.
 
This also does not include easly made other stories, either offical or unoffical. You would not even need a expansion pack to make many more stories with what you have.

Fun investigative/puzzle game that seems really stacked against the investigators.  We are having fun playing it more like an RPG where the keeper is there for coolness instead of beating the other players; could definitely be different with 4 investigators instead of 3.

RATING: 3
I've only played a couple of times but so far it seems like a much more enjoyable version of Arkham Horror. The maddening randomness of AH has been replaced with "gameyness" of having a Keeper. I'll take that trade any day. As a bonus, Mansions of Madness takes considerably less time to play. A good solid game, at least until we use up all the scenarios. We'll see after that.

---------------------------------------------------------

I've now played each of the scenarios and my awe of the game has lessened and my annoyance has grown. I really like the theme and the idea of a keeper as opposed to random events as in Arkham Horror but once again it is astoundingly clear that Fantasy Flight has not done much, if any, play-testing. In practically every scenario the keeper can win the game (100% of the time!) if he spams a single reusable ability or if he draws the right mythos card (of which he'll be drawing one or two every single round). For instance, in several scenarios the players must get through a manhole cover to continue the adventure. The only way to open the manhole cover is by finding a crowbar. If the keeper plays a mythos card that destroys the crowbar, the game is over; players lose. That is just one example of many, many unbalanced and obviously untested elements to this game. Once again, I love the theme. I love the scenarios and basic mechanics of the game. But the lack of balance is nothing short of unforgivable.

This game represents about 4 hours of my life that I will never get back. The only horror I experienced was being stuck in a game that wouldn't end.
Initially, I would have described this game as an adult version of Hero Quest, but it turns out that in contrast to this game, Hero Quest was fun to play.
This game suffers from so many things it's hard to know where to start. It wants to be an athmospheric RPG, but the players cannot contribute to the story-telling. It wants to give a sense of horror through sanity points, but those just end up being a second kind of hit point without real meaning. The madness the GM can unleash on the weakened minds seem insulting to the player rather than scary. The puzzles the players have to solve are ridiculously easy for the players and frustratingly cumbersome for the characters to deal with. The game heaps on mechanic after mechanic as if to give depth to the game, but instead just buries it. I can see no redeeming points about this game at all.

I so wanted to love this game but instead the puzzles annoy, the replay value is low, the setup time is dreadful, and the game flow via clues is often boring and half the time, finidng the clues doesn't make a difference in the endgame... The number of cards seems awewsome until you split each deck up into its useful real stack value and then you find that there are only a couple of different cards in each of the 92723721.2 stacks. It's a shame...  The components, sans the monster mini bottoms, are just awesome. But you can't put lipstick on a pig and expect it to be anything else than one. This game is one or two expansions away from being a solid game. As it is sold now, it provides too little value for the dollar.

After watching the YouTube game play "watch it played" I decided to get it at my local.  It was $100.01 CND after tax and I don't regret it.  A solid game if you like DnD role-play.  Yes, it took 2h to set up for 1st game and 4 hours to play mainly due to discussions of strategy.  Keeper won but only by a hair.

I'd like this to be a monster massacre, but the feeling that I don't have enough time to kill every monster and explore every room leaves me unsatisfied. I know, this is pretty much spot on with the lovecraftian theme (so it doesn't make much sense that I critize Arkham Horror for being a Bug Hunt, then miss the bug hunt here, but the difference is the location set: here you're in a "haunted" mansion, not in a city), but I hunger for a dungeon looter, which this isn't (and probably shouldn't be). Still, not bad at all.

On a first glance it might look like this is like Descent set in the 20s Massachusetts, but it couldn’t be more wrong. The game is much more geared towards the story in the game and the application of the theme makes it unique. This is a game that is more of an experience than it is a game and once you understand that you can really enjoy it. There is room for some gamey decisions, but it can leave me with a little sour taste in my mouth. That is especially true when the keeper is pinning down some investigators. Some scenarios are also ridiculously hard for the investigors. There seems to be a flaw in the play testing. Another thing that is a flaw is that the scenarios, while interesting and immersive can be a little too railroaded.

As usual the game sounds interesting, but it may turn out to be an over produced monster like Arkham Horror, and the price tag is obscene! 

UPDATE
Ok, the game's price tag has greatly decreased to something manageable now. 
I played tonight the first scenario. I have mixed feelings about this one, I guess I don't really have the nerve any more to endure three hours of ameritrash. 
Nevertheless it was - summing it up - fun. I wasn't impressed with some other stuff. 

SO I'm really on the fence. I really need to play more to have a clear idea, either I dig it or I lower it to a measly "6". 
I guess, also, that it could be a whole different experience to be the Keeper. I might one evening find out. We'll see. 

UPDATE
Ok, I replayed. This time as the Keeper. I liked it, even if we didn't finish. 
This is no groundbreaking experience, but I would play again, and I would suggest to play. 
This is a solid "8" in my book. 

UPDATE
I replayed once again. The dreaded Classroom Curses adventure. I have to say that even if it was a little slow, this game continues to be a light entertainment that I'll want to visit again. And probably again. 
So the vote sticks: a solid overall "8". 

UPDATE
Last game we played there was no bonus for the investigators to press on and achieve things fast, in fact the trigger as it went worked against the players who were making good progress. I'm not sure this is nicely calibrated, thus I downgrade this game to "7".

MoM is exactly what I hoped for: a board game that keeps the atmosphere and intensity of the Call of Cthulhu role-playing game. It's what I had hoped Arkham Horror would be. The game shines when run by a good Keeper player: the scenarios generate a feeling of dread and suspense, but the keeper can really amplify this by keeping the game on a slow burn. The game takes about an hour to set up (since you'll want to double- and triple-check everything) but setup is still nowhere near an average wargame in difficulty. I look forward to playing this again and again, exhausting all the scenarios one tense evening after another.

I like the theme, quality components, and game flow. FF has done a good job of adding new scenarios and expansions to keep the game rolling. On the down side, the story line is very abstract when the game is played.  Furthermore, my game group has had many anti-climatic endings. Example: run out the door you happen to be next to and win.

Gorgeously produced, really hard to get into. Too many rules and yet following the rules themselves won't really produce a very great playing experience because the Keeper is almost always at a huge advantage.

RATING: 7
The scenario driven game limits it... there should have been a full coop mode where you don't need a player to play the bad guy... again FF focuses more on eyecandy rather than the actual game itself.

The french version had many errors btw.

It would have been more appreciated if it and its expansions would be affordable. Costs way too much for the little it has to offer (limited replayability).

Also, it is highly overpriced (100$+ tx for base game, LOL). The current version should have been the De Luxe version, and there should be one with cardboard tokens that represents all the characters and their enemies.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The game is about racing to incrementally reveal a horror/mystery story (i.e. win conditions) while trying to cope with more or less subtle horrific events. This idea is simply marvelously implemented. It's like a hard and fast CoC scenario that focusses on the basics. Nice components, great game art, fast to get into. It is a story based game, i.e. it is quite linear; as far as choices are concerned, they are situative (ad hoc), not really tactical, and certainly not strategic. 

As the game has received ample of pre-publication hype, let me focus on the negative points. The problem I have is that the keeper's actions are somewhat generic, and it is at times far from obvious when and how to pursue one's available actions in order to win. As it turns out, some game plots require the keeper to immediately and consistently pursue a specific task. But as he is not allowed to look up on the event cards that pace the game, it is almost impossible to understand in advance what to do. Of course, it becomes somewhat easier with experience to grasp the demands of the task at hand, but it is still far from obvious. Moreover, the investigators pick their characters independently of the game plot. Thus, it can turn out that a non-fighter group needs to tackle a shoggoth, or, alternatively, a guns blazing investigator kill team finds itself in a race-for-time plot and is utterly slowed down by puzzles. Balancing the investigators is not the solution, because often it is useful to break up the group, and the dumb fighter character can end up having to pick locks, and the  smart loremaster ends up having to defeat the monster. Of course, this will also be a flashy story, just one that was doomed to fail from the get go. 

Still, even though MoM is not exactly an amazingly balanced game, it certainly is a VERY entertaining story based game. If everyone at the table is happy to play in order to see how a faceted horror story unfolds, almost every play will be a memorable experience - even if the ratio between decisions made and relevant impact on the game is not as high as one might wish.

Great game! Blends Roleplaying, Exploration, Resource Management and Hack&Slash mechanics perfectly. It all depends on the Keeper I guess. If your Keeper is not the hardcore gamer 'I must win' type and concentrates on the story telling it's awesome.
I like the mechanics, they take a while to explain correctly, but after a few turns of gameplay it's all good.
I recommend you dim the lights and put on some creepy music. You'll get into the world of MoM becoming the very characters you play. After 1 hour you'll forget your real name and refer to your friends as Ashcan, Jack or Gloria. Get into it!

Joc semicooperatiu d'exploració basat en escenaris ambientat en els mites de Lovecraft. Molt inmersiu i temàtic, l'atzar es influyent, però sense ser el més important.
Jugat amb banda sonora (Midnight Syndicate és el grup ideal) i l'ambient idoni (poca llum, jugadors involucrats), resulta una experiencia molt divertida.

Requereix expansions per no tornarse repetitiu.

RATING: 3
The deduction element to this game is really just chrome. It's a dungeon crawl with a clunky attempt to make the random occurences seem like a narrative.

We will play this game again soon and my opinion could very easily change. Maybe it was just the scenario that we played.

UPDATE: Played this three times. Players move from point A to point B in order to receive their next command. This tells them to move to point C. Rinse and repeat.

This falls into the same category as Arkham and Eldritch Horror. I probably like the atmosphere best in this one, but man this is the fiddliest of the bunch! Would really like to try 2nd edition with the app. (8.2.2017)

Arkham Horror: the Card Game has completely replaced these older titles in the "Horror"-series. I would still be willing to try the 2nd edition. (13.11.17)

RATING: 6
Had fun but I want to play again before finalizing the score. Great components and theme, but I don't think I like it as well as arkham, and it has a few other issues that I think will bother folks, the puzzles feel a little out of place and if you don't pay attention to the clue the game goes stupid on you.  That being said it's very exciting that such a narrative based game is out there and I look forward to playing it again.

EDIT:  Second play, this time as the keeper/DM, and the game's flaws weren't just because we were unfamiliar with the rules first time around.  The players seem to have very little control on the outcome of the game.  As the keeper, your choices aren't particularly interesting, and if the players luck into discovering the quest related elements quickly, you probably can't win.  The problem with this in a story driven game is that the luck in mansions does not create tension or a story.  This is the exact opposite of arkham, where every time the dice are rolled or a key card drawn you are on the edge of your seat.  No one is going to tell stories about the time they lucked into going to the correct room really early, as opposed to an arkham situation where a player got lucky and killed a space vampire with her bare hands.  Really too bad, because a lot of the parts here are great, the combat system is solid, the components are gorgeous, but the quest narratives drive the game instead of the players driving the story, and that, combined with rules that are more complex than arkham, leave me questioning if I would play this instead of arkham horror.  I don't think I ever would.

Beautiful artwork. Love the mini-figs. A LOT of pieces. The instruction manual was a lot to read. Took us a while to figure out what the hell we were doing. There are a few things I would like to fix about the game, but overall fun and great theme. I think I like Betrayal at House on the Hill better because it's a more stripped down version of this game and easier to get into with people who haven't played before, while still being very fun.

Fun and atmospheric but swingy and some scenario setups are nigh-unbeatable while others are easy. Balanced not really, but a fun thematic romp yes.

Similar to Betrayal at House on the Hill, but more in-depth and with a better atmosphere. It is also more complicated, a bit longer, and setup is lengthy. It's still a lot of randomness but the story you generate through that randomness is entertaining. Great minis too. This gets the edge over Betrayal when I'm in the mood for this sort of thing.

RATING: 5
I wanted to love the game.. but it didn't happen.

Not knowing the objective builds tension on one hand, but leaves the investigators with nothing else to do, then follow the trail of clues and grab everything in reach. Not very strategic (i guess the game aims more for immersion)

The combat is quick but players are disappointed that their weapon did 5 damage with one card flip & 1 with the next.. and if they loose the scenario because of that.. bummer.. would have prefered a die-roll.

The game is really hard on the investigators, since they don't know what the objective is, the gm can simply wait & build up his threat. Then at the exact opportune moment he can release all hell on them & most often win the game. With other games i don't mind when the group looses but with this one i felt bad smashing them down. Maybe because it's more about theme & horror.. so if they loose because of one hitpoint, everyone sits around and thinks.. well..

Another thing is often you realize "well i can't win the game anymore" or "they can't win the game anymore" because they/the gm would need to move more spaces than he actually can.. so should you stop right there or play 3 more rounds although you already know who won..? Unsatisfying.

Other than that great production value & theme.. i just had huge expectations..

It's quite an epic game. There's a few broken scenarios. The game isn't fun unless you're playing as all four investigators against the keeper, because there's simply not enough to do as an investigator. Investigators don't actually have much to do other than...float around from room to room. Nevertheless, fantastic components, extremely thematic, great art, just somewhat lacking plays at times. YMMV, I've had one REALLY good game, and one really stale game.

RATING: 4
This one is difficult to rate.

On the one hand, I really enjoy playing this game.

On the other hand, MoM is very clearly missing large sections of the game -- the bits, rules, and extra scenarios put off until the inevitable expansion is released. This is even more blatant than in [thing=17226][/thing].

By way of contrast, [thing=10547][/thing] in its second edition contains everything one needs to play for dozens and dozens of times.

While this may be good marketing on the part of FFG, it makes me feel as if I bought an expensive demo version of a video game. I'll have to pay more down-the-road to upgrade to the full version.

The errata is not too severe, but troubling nonetheless. The most serious problem I foresee is a lack of replayabilty once the five scenarios have been played.

Later: The lack of replayability when playing with one group of gamers is definitely a problem. Players begin to choose which character they'll play and which options they'll take based solely on the scenario to be played. I suppose characters could be assigned randomly, but that seems kind of bogus. Dropped rating from a "9" to a "7" accordingly. Perhaps a big book of scenarios might convince me to raise my rating.

Even Later: Many of the scenarios (especially 4 and 5) are not well playtested or borderline broken, leaving only about 10 plays. I've kind of given up on this game. I'll use it as a play aid in my Call of Cthulhu RPG sessions, but as a stand alone board game -- pass. Pity, because I laid out some serious cash for this one. [i]Tant pis.[/i] Dropped from a "7" to a "4".

Great concept. Well thought out theme. And I still have buyer's remorse. The setup is way too long, and the flavor gets lost after the game takes *way* too long, and the players are always beating off monsters and trying to get the red key then the blue key, then the....you get the idea. Could have been something better if not for the length of the game that actually detracts from the excellent flavor, until it gets old and boring.

As [thing=66356]Wrath of Ashardalon[/thing] is to [family=190][/family], so [i]Mansions of Madness[/i] is to [family=310]Call of Cthulhu[/family].

Both board games maintain the general theme while stripping out the free-form role-playing elements by reducing player actions to a small set of discrete choices.  The end result is a feel similar to the mechanical surface of the source role-playing games, allowing the players to tell shallow stories without the usual RPG prep-time overhead.  (Veteran RPGers will scoff at this, and they should, since experienced players can whip up a far deeper and more satisfying game in moments with nothing more than [i]paper-pencils-dice[/i] and the Magic of [COLOR=#CC0000]Im[/COLOR][COLOR=#FF6633]ag[/COLOR][COLOR=#FFCC33]in[/COLOR][COLOR=#00CC00]at[/COLOR][COLOR=#0033FF]ion[/COLOR].)

That said, [i]Mansions of Madness[/i] *is* the [i]D&D[/i] board game version of [i]Call of Cthulhu[/i], with all the wonder and nerd-rage that such an eldritch mash-up implies.  Monsters are there for shooting at, and not as a last resort...  It's best to ignore the two-fisted comic book treatment of the source material and just enjoy it for what it is.

It's a board game opportunity to engage in a plot with clues, puzzles, and—if you're lucky—a broken leg and suicide.

The combat cards are nifty; when a player says, "I'm shooting at the thing at the end of the hallway," it's rarely a simple Marksmanship test—the player can miss and hurt themselves in the process or find the thing suddenly right next to them.  And even when you "win" you can wind up dead in the process.

[b]A note to future Keepers:[/b]  [i]The story portion of the game really shines when players narrate their actions with a bit of detail—encourage this.  Also, it really helps if you embellish and customize the flavor text on the cards.  When fighting a cultist, for example, replace all references to the foe with "cultist" and have him or her do and say "culty" things.  The game more than meets you halfway on this stuff, but if you can supply the other half it's a full-blown hoot.[/i]

The game is lavishly produced, with miniatures that actually beg to be painted.  (Disregard the "chicken leg" Shoggoths and Mi-Gos masquerading as the Hamburgler.)  Also, it's not nearly as complicated as the rule book would have you believe.  It's refreshingly simple compared to [thing=15987]Arkham Horror[/thing].

After one play I'm giving it an 8—though I expect the rating to rise with more plays.  We're all inveterate hams and lifelong RPGers, so this drubs all the right nubbins for us.

UPDATE:  Sure enough, this game is great.  The only thing holding the rating back from shooting to an auto-10 is the fragile nature of the interlocking systems.  They're all neat, but a single error in one place can cascade through and break the game, usually to the detriment of the Investigators.  (Small mistakes magnify as the game progresses.  In our first two games the win came down to time management, and early errors in movement rates meant the Investigators couldn't win.  Familiarity with the systems should mitigate this.)  This forces the players to slew hard left into RPG territory and hand-wave the issue away in order to save the game, something that feels unnatural and suspect in a board game.

Also, the puzzle mechanic is genius fun.  It's not that the puzzles are challenging—they're pretty simple—but I'm a huge fan of props from the game world made actual size.  The result is a nice bit of immersion.

UP-UPDATE:  Revising upward to a 9.  Our last two games have been real nailbiters, literally hanging on a final die roll.  Both times the narrative elements narrowed to a satisfying climax for all players—when this game works, it works really, really well.  Fantastic system.

I love this game. The game plays like a story, so you can really get wrapped up in it. It becomes a lot scarier than Arkham Horror... especially when you have a giant Mi-go flying toward you going after your hair and skin samples and flying away to place them on an altar to raise some creepy thing... I still get the heebie jeebies thinking about it.

This game is a blast, the rules all worked intuitively and the story-driven game was fun for me the keeper to setup and for them the investigators to uncover.

This game is flawed mechanically, and some of the scenarios aren't great. In fact, any criticism I've heard levelled at Mansions of Madness I can't disagree with.

Made infinitely better by the addition of the Call of the Wild expansion scenarios and the combat cards from the Forbidden Alchemy expansion.

Preliminary rating after 1 play as keeper.

BRUTALLY long setup. Really not the best idea to try to learn this one at a con (Pax east)  The keeper should choose the scenario and set up the game beforehand, and learning the rules on the fly is not going to work well.  

That said, it is thematically rich and seems to have a reasonable replay level.  If you like Arkham and Betrayal you will probably like it, since it's sort of a combination of the two.  

I will be playing this again, as a friend of mine just got it, so I can see this rating increasing, and is not likely to go down.

Of all the games in my collection, Mansions is the game that gets requested to be brought back to the table the most. And that remains true for every group I've played it with, regardless of how different those groups tend to be. In spite of the longer setup time, in spite of the weight, in spite of the game's length, everyone I play with loves it. 

Mansions just brings with it such a rich, gratifying game experience and impresses upon each player a lasting memory of the narrative that developed over the course of the game. Years later friends reminisce about that disastrous time we opened the freezer, or about that time the whole house got set on fire, or how they solved the runic puzzle at the last possible moment before getting overtaken by a horde of zombies. The game works wonderfully for making the stories it tells come alive for those playing it. 

For facilitating a night of great social interaction and memories and fun, Mansions is without a doubt the best game I can think of. Easily one of my favorite games.

This game has flaws.  Unbalanced scenarios and sometimes the keeper needs to hold punches to keep a fun narrative for the players, but beyond that, this has been a favorite of mine over the past year. Everyone I've played it with has had a great time too.

Dice emphasize drama at the expense of skill, strategy, and tactics.

I could be convinced to play this if all involved were merciless min-maxers, but far too often the players attracted to this type of game are socialisers, achievers, and explorers; not killers. I prefer first edition for the ability to play a single game without needing to be tied to a campaign

Mansions of Madness is a great game. Thematically, it's probably the best Cthulhu/Lovecraft game out there. The miniatures included are quite nice. My only complaints are the set-up required is extensive and the combat system, although thematically good, gets old pawing through the combat deck looking for just the right type of combat card.

If it had less extensive set up, I'd play it more often. Even with the set-up, though, it's a great game. 8/10

RATING: 7
Sounds interesting, A mix of Betrayal at House on the Hill, Descent, Arkham and CLUE on steroids!? 

Could be cool indeed even if somewhat rehashed, lets see how streamlined it comes out...

Edit - Well Jeremy's review says mostly streamlined and it looked that way to me, EXCEPT the puzzles as mentioned.  I still wonder about a little downtime which was not mentioned (will depend on player# and will be HUGE during puzzle mode I suspect) and am [i]especially[/i] concerned with the replay value as it stands (once again we need a FF expansion fix, a nasty pattern that is though this one was planned this way....). Also it seems like in many of these games (FOD comes to mind), the bad guy has the more interesting decisions to make and has been also mentioned the annoying repetitive checks and lack of protection if an Investagator all seems a little off, no way to mitigate some of the DM nastiness (again fixpack in expansion).  

Why don't they do more outside playtesting to flush this shit out during the design process instead of waiting for us to always expose it??? How many times does the same pattern need to repeat, its been [i]years[/i]?  I know they can do better.  

Cautiously Optimistic, it should be cool in a BAHOTH kind of way and I do like puzzles in general so the game being one big one seems fun. Definitely want to play, maybe own. I expect it to be a better Betrayal than Betrayal and like it there is a mystery to solve but a slightly more interesting one, probably a 7.5 - 8 for me

Edit - Played, its mostly like Betrayal as suspected and I like it a LITTLE better than Betrayal, which is less than I expected. Decisions are not that interesting as an Investigator and this to me was the biggest weakness, overall the game did run well otherwise. This is probably as good as a game like this is going to get, "it is what it is" applies.  

The theme is strong of course and the game being one big puzzle is cool (though your just searching all the cards trying to get lead to the one that reveals the objective), however I do figure it will be good for maybe 3 plays for me which wasn't enough to buy it (not due to replay, but do to waning interest).

RATING: 7
The components are very high quality and add nicely to the theme.  One game played.  I was the keeper and there were four investigators.  The investigators ran into serious trouble as they didn't have any fighters in the group.  I did warn them about this but they didn't coordinate character choices.  That said, we were all expecting more of a Betrayal on the Hill exploration rather than a constant slugfest.  We ended up cutting it short as it was clear the investigators were going to lose.  It ended up being a bit of a downer.  I think it could be fun but the investigators need to be warned to be ready for lots of fighting.  One mistake I made was to keep the keeper action cards secret so they didn't know what I could throw at them, although I don't think it made much of a difference since I gave them advance warning about the most important one.  Something that also differed from Arkham Horror is that the characters mostly get weaker (damaged and traumatized) as the play goes forward rather than stronger.  If you like building up a character, this doesn't seem to be the game for you.  Also took longer than expected.  Anyway, looking forward to trying again and hopefully having a better time with it.

Second game: Went better this time.  Party of four with two fighters and two thinkers.  They left a trail of dead monsters.  They did still get hung up on the monsters.  I had to give them some coaching and pulled my punches on the cards but they still got frustrated.  I think it would go well if the keeper only got half the threat tokens.  Then the keeper could go all out without overwhelming the players.  That said, they also had some bad luck. We also didn't have a good sense of just how time strapped the players are.  I think they really need to just charge forward and mostly ignore the monsters, contrary to the player guide posted on this site that suggests standing and fighting.  The keeper can basically just generate a new monster every single turn when there are four players.  I really want to like this game but it's a little off somehow.  For example, even when you've got a gun, there is a tendency for the fight cards to ask for a roll on something other than marksmanship, resulting in a lot of misses or dropping the weapon.

Setup was too long, tear down was too long, and the part in between was too long.  The puzzles seemed cool, but they lasted too long as people got all AP about them.  The scenario we played seemed extremely scripted.  I wanted to like the game, but it fell flat.  The length might not be as bad with more experience, but then it seems like the scriptedness would be worse.

A stunning game. 

Probably the best RPG boardgame experience out there, and with the right group, it can be very immersive.

However, the setup is very long, the scenarios in the base game are not very good and the game can feel aimless or pointless for players at times, especially those players that can't or won't immerse themselves in the storytelling.

Good, enjoyable, very thematic and atmospheric game. Component overload though, and setup is a killer. I also fear the actual gameplay aspect of the game will come up lacking after a few games (especially when playing as the keeper, where one's options are quite limited).

In my first game, after painstakingly building the map and seeding it with *just* the right cards, actual gameplay consisted mostly of spawning endless hordes of cultists and sending them after the investigators.

Initial Rating: 8.0 (February 2012)

As I love Arkham Horror, I thought I would like Mansions Of Madness and I did. The miniatures are gorgeous and very well painted (in the copy we played). Also it is nice that you can use them in an Arkham Horror game and the components are top notch (as expected from FFG). The game is comparable to Betrayal at the House on the Hill but the theme (and miniatures) gives an edge to Mansions of Madness.

The gameplay is deceptively simple so you can explain the game quick enough but it can take 2 hours+ to finish it.  You need the right group of people to properly enjoy this (as Arkham Horror) but it can be a lot of fun. To really enjoy the game, the keeper (and players in a minor capacity) need to role-play this, Reading and tweaking the text to adapt it to the situation at hand. What I really like about this is how the story develops. 

I´m not sure about the puzzles, I need to play more to see how I feel about them. For now they feel novel enough.

My main worry was that the game has only a few plays in it, but that was before I was the keeper. Now I know that each scenario is variable and have 3 different objectives and that is very neat. I want to play them all. Another aspect of the game I don’t like is the lengthy setup, comparable in time to Earth Reborn. I’m not sure which is larger but in my second game I took more time building the map and choosing the cards than playing the actual game :/.

Another potential problem in this regard, is that the keeper has to set up the game correctly, if he messes up and the mistake is not noticed right away, the game can break wasting all players´ time. 

For now I’m downgrading this to a 6.5 rating as this is not a game I want to play every week, but I´m usually willing to play it. Also, it is a good game with the right group. I want to (and will) play it again.

As is the case with most of Fantasy Flight's product line, I really wanted to like this game. Unfortunately, I don't purely enjoy games because of the theme. I am looking for game-play, the rules and mechanics that make the game interesting, challenging, and fun to play. And on this account MoM fails pretty hard. The missions take forever to set up, there is very little strategy to be had on both investigator's and dungeon master's part, basically the whole system is flawed. Not that it's unplayable, but bad enough that I am pretty disappointed.

Mansions of Madness is sort of a Cthulhu-themed version of Betrayal at the House on the Hill, without one of the players turning on the others (although there's no reason that couldn't happen...). Players explore the house, going from clue to clue until the objective is revealed, at which point, things get very intense. One player is the keeper and runs the house and the monsters and the various nefarious things that get thrown in the investigators' way.

It's a fun game. One thing that is unique in this versus similar games and is worth mentioning is the way in which locks are handled. To pick a lock, the player needs to complete a puzzle. There are three types of puzzles to solve, which all start with a randomly placed set of tiles. You solve the puzzle by rotating, swapping and trading out tiles to achieve a certain pattern. The trick is that you can only make as many moves as your character's Intellect. Even if you have adequate intellect, the player's skill in puzzle solving is still a big factor. I think this is a brilliant little piece that uses BOTH a player's skill and a character's traits together. I was dubious about in-game puzzle solving until I saw it at work. While the game as a whole is not terribly unique, that single mechanic within the game is absolutely inspired!

My experience with this game was disastrous! It's hard for me to know just what I think due to a keeper who did a horrible job of explaining the rules, and mislead me into thinking it was a 90 minute game when in fact it took 4 hours.

On the flip side I really want to like the game. It has a very interesting theme and all the components are beautiful and engaging. Upon reading the rules (after the fact) and reflecting on the game I don't think the actual mechanics and game play are very good. I don't mind longer thematic games when they're done right, however this game seems to have some serious issues for me.

Not letting the investigators know what's in the keeper manual makes no sense to me. I have the same issue with Descent. Either the game can stand up to multiple plays where the 'heroes' know the scenario, or it can't. If it can't then the game replay is shit, and if it can then how can it be balanced for both cases? With so much hidden info in Mansions the investigators hardly even know what they're doing, it's hard to be engaged in the game.

There are many very boring turns as an investigator. You often use your only (very precious) action on a turn to move again, in addition to your other 2. Getting around the map is tedious and unfulfilling. People talk about the great thematic flavor text and clues but as far as I can tell this is mostly hot air. You need to collect stuff from rooms, there is sometimes a useful 'hint' in the text as to which room to check, but you kind of want to check them all and the ones with locks are obviously more important.

The keeper seems to have lots of little decisions and interesting things to think about whereas the investigator turns are pretty much autoplay. In other games like this you could imagine trying to automate the keeper making the game full co-op (this is exactly what I do in Runebound Midnight), in this game I would rather be the keeper with automated investigators. One could play solo as the keeper. This lacks the balance that Descent has, in that game both sides have interesting things happening and it's almost inconceivable that either side could be automated. That balance is definitely missing here. This is another reason why the investigators should know what's in the keeper scenario book, it gives them some more decision space.

I would like to try this again sometime, but I also want to avoid it... so I don't know where that leaves me. Even if it's as good as I could imagine It would still be kind of long and not that great :P

A game I played to death as the keeper. I don't think I could face keeping any more but I still enjoy investigating those stories i've forgotten or haven't played.  It's a game that works best when the keeper plays more like a GM and less like an opponent.

As so-called "Ameritrash" games go, this is one of the better ones in my opinion.  Full of cool puzzles and monsters.  

... lest we forget, my God it really really is a beautiful game to look at!

I bought Mansions of Madness, being hyped by al the attention it got shortly before and after its release. I've watched and read several reviews that pointed out a few flaws, and despite of that I got a copy. I really enjoy Arkham Horror, I love the artwork of the HP Lovecraft universe, and the theme is an amazing background for great storytelling. 
After playing through a couple of the scenarios as the Keeper, I felt that I really enjoyed the game, especially the way the storyline is interwoven throughout the game. Characters are simple enough to be easily playable, but provide enough variety to really matter in certain situations. Combat seems to work just fine. However, this game tends to last too long for what it delivers, and I'm not sure I like the stories that much. They seem too straightforward sometimes. I'm hoping that there will be a great expansion waiting for us, and I definately should try to play this game as one of the investigators.

FFG succeeded in creating another bottomless money pit. Even after only two games with a friend's copy I can feel the urge of possessing the full monty with all expansions. And that's before the first of many expansions is on the market! If you are into Ameritrash, Mansions of Madness is all you could ask for. There's a great Cthulhu theme implemented in a shorter and less fiddly way than Arkham Horror. It's semi-cooperative and tells a story in an RPG-like fashion notwithstanding the limitations of boardgaming, i.e. having to stay within a defined frame. The typical risk of differing quality of story development is there but our second game had such a great story arc that I can live with it. Best of all, there's actual decisions to be made on both sides that make Mansions worth playing even for Eurogamers like me that were bored to death by the irrelevant gameplay of Last Night on Earth.
Nonetheless, I'm a bit hesitant when it comes to purchasing MoM on my own. A big part of the fun is discovering new rooms, monsters or spells. As it is, the fun will be more in new combinations of known components. Playing it with friends owning the game and moderating the scenarios might be the perfect way for this game.

Desperately wanted to love this but sold it after 5-10 plays.  Some issues:  

1) Too fiddly at times
2) Scenario design was hit or miss, which in a game that shipped with only five scenarios was a pain.  
3) It's extremely difficult to balance winning the game as the mastermind vs. making sure the non-mastermind players have a good time.  

I'd love to see a complete redesign show up in Mansions of Madness 2 but I doubt that's forthcoming.

OKAY, this is my rating of this game, but My hubby would say 10.  He loves this game.  Therefore, I willingly play keeper so he can explore and battle monsters as much as he wants.  And I admit it is a very cool RPG, but setting up this game as the keeper is an event in itself, but if done right can take the other players on a cool rollercoaster of storyline, which they most likely will not figure out the first time.  I think as of yet neither side has won a game in our plays, YET!. But we continue to work out the strategies.  And with multiple campaigns in the base game and many expansions, we should be playing this for a longtime to come.

This is for the first edition of the game while its still a 1-vs-all game.

In short, I consider this is another "Good experience, bad game" like arkham horror. It's a themeatic game with very uninteresting mechanic and serious balance issues, I also despise the illusion of player's choice in this game. The layers of unnecessary randomness for the sake of "Thematic game experience" simply frustrate me.

Looks brilliant! Thematic, superb components (pity about the errata), no production problems with my copy, replayability may be tricky with the way the scenarios are put together but the way the clues are distributed should make inventing new scenarios straightforward? Note to myself : use the BGG suggestion of putting a lock card on every room? later note: probably not necessary against newcomers?
Can't wait for the expansions!

Rating after Keeper-ing scenarios 1 & 2. Very long games otherwise rating would have been higher. Won 2 lost 2 so far. Rating up .2 for now (8.1 start).

Back down to 8.1 after a few more plays - it's just a bit too long?

RATING: 7.1
Number of players: 2-5

Components: (10)
This game looks wonderful! All the minis look so great! I would have liked if they had came painted, but that would have made the game so much more expensive. Also, I know that many people like that they come unpainted so that they can customize them in that way. They're all so distinct, however, that no one should ever have a problem confusing any of them with any other.
  
Rules: (7)
To be fair, I don't remember reading the rules to this game very well. I do know that it wasn't the most well written rule book. Fantasy Flight Games seem to excel in EVERYTHING they do, save for writing rules, at which they usually prove to be the worst in the industry. 

Setup: (4)
Don't get me wrong, here. Set up in worth every bit of hassle it takes, but it takes a lot. If you screw anything up, you'll screw the entire game up. Be careful. It's horrible.

Area required to play: (6)
The game will take up a fair amount of room, but it's really nice to see it set up.
 
Fun: (10)
And where it counts, this game delivers!

Theme Integration / Mechanics: (8)
Most of thing game is so great at to make it worth all the small things that I don't like about it, including some of the mechanics (the ones, really, that I was most excited about). Some of the puzzles and other things that make set-up so bad end up being really easy. It's still fun, though.

Replay Value: (7)
I love it and want to play it again all the time. However, it's so fiddly that you'll think twice before pulling it from the shelf.

Storage: (3)
Everything will fit back in the box somehow, but don't think for a minute that it'll be pretty or make any kind of sense.

Accessibility: (6)
It's not the worst game to introduce someone to, but it's not the easiest either. If they'll sit still for it, I think most anyone would have fun.

Over-All/Bonuses/Biases: (+10) All in all, I still really love this game. It's just too fiddly to make it to the table as often as it would otherwise.

I find the theme bordering on offensive.  I generally don't care for any type of fantasy or horror theme, but I'm not a big fan of the artwork or the occult themes that run throughout the game.

That said, they did a great job making the play time manageable, the ruleset fairly clean and the combat easily resolved.  This feels a ton more approachable than Arkham Horror, though I feel like these games have very little in common.  Mansions of Madness is essentially an exploration game, and while the puzzles are a unique addition, it is kind of stupid to have one person working with a puzzle while everyone else waits.

Aficionados of the game would seem to have a valid point if it seems like replayability is lacking (I'm sure there are plenty of expansions in the pipeline), though since I don't see myself playing it that much that is not a big deal for me.

Basically it comes down to the fact that FFG products admirably strive to create a certain ambiance that envelops you while playing.  I would probably appreciate this more if I was a fan of fantasy/scifi/horror themes in the first place.  But as it is I will play this a couple more times, but it would never be my first choice.

FINALLY!!!
After what feels like ages, I hold this in my happy little hands... More comments to follow after a few plays...

After having downloaded, printed and read the rules, and read and watched all the previews, there weren´t many surprises when I opened the box... except for the larger monsters being much bigger than I had imagined, nice! 
Boards had slight warping, nothing catastrophical... 

Thoughts after first play:
- Setup is a bit fiddly and time consuming.
- Huge replayability! The investigators lost, and only saw a fraction of the house before doing so. We could play the scenario with the exact same story/setup choices, at least once more.
-Rules are for the most part easy to remember, but I still did a lot of flicking through the book... would LOVE to have it boilt down to a nifty, hand sized reference sheet. UNIVERSAL HEAD are you listening!? (smiley!)
Can´t really say if he was listening, but he certainly went and made that nifty hand sized reference sheet...Check it out in the FILES section.
-VERY FUN! This came captures the best parts of Heroquest (which Descent failed to do) and kicks it up a notch! Mansions keeps moving along at a nice pace, without getting bogged down by by overwhelming protracted fights, and it´s overall less fiddly than Arkham Horror.
-Puzzles work great, but sometimes you´re very lucky with the pieces drawn, and they´re ridicously easy.
-Love it, already dreaming about what they´ll put in the expansions... and we all know that there WILL be expansions...

De la colección de los Mitos de Lovecraft, este jeugo es sin duda el más inmersivo. El pero handicap que tenía era si setup larguísimo del que debía ocuparse el master en solitario. Esto se ha eliminado con la aparición de la App. Juego sencillo de mecánicas pero que no perdona una si quieres oconseguir la victoria.

This is a great game for theme and gameplay.  The rules are simple, the stories are interesting, the components are really nice and the expansions, so I believe since I haven't played them myself, have dealt with the fact that many early scenarios had a lot of problems with gameplay.  On the other hand, the setup is clunky and one error can ruin an entire gameplay.  Large cards obstruct what would otherwise be an awesome looking game board.  And I despise the "Okay, stop!" mechanic where the Overlord has to play specific cards at specific moments.  Honestly I don't find much enjoyment in being the Overlord and that is all I have ever done since I own the game.  This just isn't a match for me or my group.  I did paint the miniatures though and it makes the game SO much more fun because it adds to the theme.

This game is kind of an odd ball. If you play this game as it is, it is a competitive piece of blip(~6). The game lacks balance and plays badly. But if one player decides to play GM instead of Overlord, this is a GREAT game(~10). Play it like a RPG and with me at the helm DMing, I have never seen anyone not LOVING this game. The flavor texts exist for one purpose -- DO NOT BE SHY TO READ THEM!!! Add so so so much to the game.

RATING: 10
I love the theme and the minis. So far I've only played three times and for now it seems to be a lot easier for the keeper to play. The keeper can build a good strategy while the investigators spend most of the game trying to figure out what they are suppose to be doing. Having said that I still feel that the clues for investigators were a bit too easy, but I still enjoeyd a lot playing the game. I think a big part of the fun is that the investigators do not know what they are suppose to be doing. Two of the three games I played as investigators and I did enjoy that more than playing the keeper (even if I lost both of these games). For me it was a good fun not knowing what would happen next. A bit like reading a short story at the same time as playing :) The narrative builds a nice story around the game right down to the end. Setup time is way too long, but for me it's all worth it once the play can actually start. All in all I love this game and the atmosphere it creates while been played.

This game definitely belongs in my collection, and I'm glad I splurged on it.  From the few times I've played Descent, my opinion is that they are very much the same.  There are a few differences, primarily in the "loot", because there are no chests in MoM, so what you start with will likely be what you use for the rest of the game, so choose your starting items wisely and try to balance the team.  Items exist in the game, but there is no surefire way to get them.  Something my group mentioned at least.  I've only played it twice but I LOVE the theme and the stories appear to be well developed.  We played the first scenario twice and I played keeper both times, but I really liked the way the decisions at the beginning weren't just numbers and setup decisions, but they had flavor text that told you what your decision meant thematically.

I am absolutely thrilled with this game in all ways. 

Similar to Arkham Horror, the setup time can be a little much, but that is forgivable. 

Simulates the feel of a survival horror game, where combat is not rewarded, but should instead be avoided (hiding from monsters and blocking off doors are worked into the game mechanically!). 

Very, very happy with this game!

CRITIQUE OF MANSIONS OF MADNESS
I don't own Mansions of Madness, and I haven't played it as the Keeper, so this critique is given simply based on several experiences playing a character in the game.

MoM is a "GM vs. Players" game with a strong Lovecraftian theme. It is highly thematic in addition to being strongly story driven. In fact, I'd say that MoM does a better job of being story driven than Mice & Mystics does, and M&M is all about story and theme.

I'm not a fan of cooperative games, because I find that they are too luck-driven. Cooperative games set you up against a random set of events going off and if you play it well the only thing that determines your success of failure is the order in which the events come up. But MoM actually pits the players against a live opponent, who actively sets up the obstacles and controls the creatures as they attempt to destroy the players. This is fantastic, and it is incredibly enjoyable to watch the Keeper try to make your fail your mission. This is the thing I like the most about MoM.

Another thing I think is very well done here are the various "tests" the characters will face in every scenario. They have some control over their ability scores and items, and they have a few skill points they can use to mitigate the luck of the die every game. But the Keeper will also be playing cards on them that impact their chances, and combat might have you rolling your Luck to hit, when you thought you'd be rolling your Marksmanship. Nice.

There are many things to like here: the great components, the interesting characters, the ready availabity of expansions, and of course (if you are into Lovecraft) the well-developed theme.

Unfortunately, the game also has the same problem that cooperative games share: how the Keeper's decks in MoM is going to play a major role in the success or failure of the investigators. It can't be helped. So, regardless of how effective they are, the investigators could either breeze through a scenario or get stomped, depending upon the luck of the draw. For a game that gets almost everything right, this is like a slap in the face.

MoM is a game that has gone on and off my wishlist, and is likely to stay off, at this point. There is a lot of tension in the game, but the players are mostly railroaded from one fairly obvious clue to the next, after bypassing a series of obstacles, the danger of which is up to random chance. In spite of this complaint, of all the Cthulhu mythos games I have played, MoM is by far the best. If you are a fan of Lovecraft, then I'd say MoM is probably a "must buy" game, and one that you will enjoy.

Holding my rating until I get to play 1-2 more times.  Didn't enjoy the first time because the Keeper has so many cards to just completely derail an investigator's turn.  Out of 6-7 turns, about half of mine went like this: "Okay, I move..."  "No you don't!  Instead, you're doing THIS first!"

I think my wife enjoys this more than I do. I have yet to play as an investigator so I can't speak much on that; playing as the Keeper though feels a bit like organizing a story as we go. Maybe that's more my play style than anything else, as I want the other players to have an enjoyable time, but I don't really feel as the Keeper that I can actually "play to win" all that much. Between this and other games with a DM-like player, I enjoy Descent 2nd quite a bit more though. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I really WANT to love this game, but I can't. It has too many flaws like the permanent dull interruptions by keeper cards and the combat system that is pseudo-stylish but not very efficient and intuitive. 

Your gangster has a good markmanship skill? Well, when you shoot you always have the "luck" that the combat card tells you to test your low dexternity skill 'cause you are falling into the room instead of simply walking and firing. So, you don't hit anything. Wow...

But the main problem is the card "Uncontrollable Urges". It's not broken, but it is getting on the nerves very quickly. It feels for the investigators as if they were a group of old senile seniors who can't hold an item, shoot on friends and can't walk a hallway without loosing a shoe. It's very annoying when one investigator always looses a key item because the keeper tells him to do so. And you always have to invest an action (the one per game round you have...) to get the item back into the hands. And when a friend approaches to help you, your character will shoot at him with his gun.

Without this dumb card the game could be very cool. And we always hope for a good story that helps forget these annoying flaws... It IS a fun and nice looking game and we will play it from time to time, but "Arkham Horror" is much better for getting into the Mythos.

This is the biggest game that I own. A team of investigators explores different mansions, depending on the story mission, on a huuuuuge board (that usually takes me a solid hour to set up). One player plays as the "Keeper" and tries to prevent the investigators from solving the mystery while trying to complete their own objective. With giant, plastic, Cthulu beasts, physical puzzle mini-games and no player elimination (if I recall correctly...) this is one of the games that I enjoy the most but never get to play.

Feels like a cross between Arkham Horror and Descent. Has the same issue as Arkham where penalties often take the form of time sinks, like losing a turn or movement penalties. This just slows the game down and ensures that you won't get to make a decision for even longer.

The combat system has probably the best simplicity vs. interesting-range-of-results I've seen in any game.

Although the setup is a little time-consuming (and easy for the keeper to screw up in game-ruining ways), I like the story-influenced arrangement better than Betrayal at House on the Hill or Descent or Arkham Horror.  I also like that it has simpler rules than Descent or Arkham Horror, and that player turns are faster than Descent.

The burrito boy (now 11) said he felt the game didn't have much strategy, which was an interesting observation; I think he may be right.  Maybe we'll feel differently after a couple more plays.

I may try running this one week, and a one-shot Call of Cthulhu game the next week, and see which the crowd prefers.  I kind of think the RPG will win.  (I run really rules-light, so I expect [i]less[/i] of a rules burden on the players in the RPG than in the board game.)  The disadvantages of the RPG are more pre-game prep time for the keeper, and no replayability of a given scenario, but in exchange you get increased flexibility, the elimination of rules nonsense--"but I have the Lantern, so why am I affected by the Power Failure lock?"--and the elimination of the inherent lameness of trying to represent a Lovecraftian horror with a plastic figure.

[b]Update:[/b] the first play with the regular group [article=6427357]didn't go so well[/article].  This game has one or two more chances to deliver some crazy fun.  [i]You hear me, Mansions of Madness?  I'll trade-pile your ass![/i]  The story-influenced arrangement I was excited about doesn't really deliver, as there's no connection between the story choices; you might as well pick your objective & story choice tiles at random.

Wow! This game is really something. If you want to scratch the Arkham itch in less time and with more of a storytelling aspect, this is the way to go.

Unfortunately, not all scenarios are created equal. The game is pretty unbalanced in favor of the keeper, and some characters have either far too little sanity or far too little stamina: one wrong character pick could end in disaster.

Additionally, there have been reported cases where one side could set up an automatic win from the get-go, or where some objectives are stupidly unfair. And after a few plays, the battle cards get repetitive and even inane. But with a little tweaking this game could be a classic.

RATING: 6
I really enjoy the battle system of this game and also like how the storytelling can get you really immersed. But after having played through all 5 scenarios at least once and after playing it with different people, the one thing that I don't like about the game is its competitive nature.
There were several sessions that simply were no fun. And if people don't have a good time while playing a game, it pretty much defeats the purpose of playing in the first place. So I'm going to change my initial rating of 7 that I gave the game after the first few plays down to 6.

Well structured scenarios gradually build threat level and gradually unveil the Awful Truth.  Clockwork masterpiece.  On the minus side monsters should be harder to kill, this is Lovecraft.  Also the GM can game some finales to auto-win, e.g. if the players will have to escape to win then just drive one player insane and hold onto the suicide trauma card until the finale.

Mansions of Madness is a macabre game of horror, insanity, and mystery for two to five players. Each game takes place within a pre-designed story that provides players with a unique map and several combinations of plot threads. These threads affect the monsters that investigators may encounter, the clues they need to find, and which climatic story ending they will ultimately experience. One player takes on the role of the keeper, controlling the monsters and other malicious powers within the story. The other players take on the role of investigators, searching for answers while struggling to survive with their minds intact.

[b]Mansions of Madness[/b] is without doubt flawed in its details (very long setup, puzzles slow down the game's flow way too much, the game's balance favours the Keeper), but the positive aspects easily outweight the negative ones for me personally (fantastic atmosphere, modular stories and board pieces for a better replay value, stunning component quality). It's essentially a roleplaying game in a box.

I would rank this game a 10/10, if said flaws would not exist in this game - so it's "just" a very high 9.

Because of the game's balance issues, the player who takes on the role as the evil Keeper should not play this game too competitively, but understand his/her role more as a story-teller like in a classic Pen & Paper roleplaying game - but it's a balancing act which is hard to pull off and requires a lot of experience with all the scenarios and story milestone choices.

(Rating based on the base game.)

Too ambitious and fiddly; it's basically a railroaded RPG lite on a board. It's a solid 7 because I can run it well, though, and I'd love to play through all the scenarios :).

2014: it seems like they managed to get a hang on scenario design perhaps a little too late. I own Call of the Wild but haven't convinced anyone to play it yet :).

RATING: 4
Does a few neat things (dealing out phobias/injuries is great, for example) but fails as a moody/tense experience when it turns more into a race immedietly after the first turn. A race taking hours while barely going anywhere. Not to mention how brutal the setup can be.

Seen it being praised as an improved Betrayal At House On The Hill, which I can't agree on, even though the whole haunt-mechanic is all Betrayal has going for it. Mansion has the more "game"-potential, but never really lives up to it. Perhaps I should try my hands at a scenario of my own...?

Anyway, this was a letdown and further plays has only worsened the experience. I can certainly see potential in 2nd editions application, but I'm getting more and more on the fence after this one.

This is a great "dungeon crawler/exploration" tile-based game with the characters and thematic elements from the Arkham series we all know and love. It's a bit of a hassle to set up (especially for the keeper), but once you delve into the game, the theme just pops out and makes players submerge in it. It's in my opinion the ultimate "thematic experience in games".

RATING: 5
This is a bit of a blend of Betrayal House on Haunted Hill and Arkham Horror.  In the end, I'd just prefer to play Betrayal.

LIKES:

* Game play is fairly straightforward but the game does have an extensive rule-set.  Not as bad as Arkham though!
* The miniatures are actually quite impressive...the larger monsters are quite fearsome!
* Game play for an investigator is quite simple.  The monster player has quite a bit more going on...

DISLIKES:

* I prefer my adventure/story telling games to be quick rule instruction and play.  While this one isn't nearly as complex as Arkham, there are enough moving parts to make this one slow down as you check a rule.
* Puzzles were an interesting twist, but they are quite simple.  Seems pointless outside of another way to make investigators waste/spend time and/or clue tokens.  
* Some gameplay doesn't make sense.  Apparently I am suddenly struck with terror/horror when I see a zombie that I passed a horror check on earlier and know that he walked out that door but it still shocks me.  Yeah, whatever.  
* I realize there are a couple modifiers available, but I don't really like so much resting on a 10 sided die.  Most of the time that means us investigators are playing somewhere between 40-60% odds on dice rolls.  
* Not a fan of scenarios where neither the DM nor the investigators win.  So, we just played for 3-4 hours so no one could win?  What a bunch of crock!

This game has so much promise but is hamstrung by several factors.
* The players have to be really into the theme and style of game play or they will be miserable.
* Several games have ended abruptly from the event cards that left a bitter taste.
* There are only five scenarios, despite the variation within each.
* Some scenarios have very little monster interaction, I feel like the multitude of miniatures supplied isn't really warranted.
* Some of the mechanics are clumsy, such as an investigator wasting a whole action in their turn to drop or pickup an item.
* The volume of errors and errata is disappointing for what I would consider a premium game.
The game has many strong points but these aspects detract from what could have been amazing.

Started my first game of this at 11:30pm hoping for an interesting 2-3 hour game. Four and a half hours later, the game was still going but I had to leave.

There are some really interesting things going on (finding clues, puzzles, story-based combat), but these also turn into negatives. The puzzles are neat, but drive the game to a grinding halt. The game provides many possibilites, but adds a lot of fiddilyness.

Betrayal at House on the Hill + Arkham Horror = ???

I like this game; the components are pretty high-quality, and the mechanics are mostly solid, especially the system for constructing scenarios, and the way the game incorporates puzzle-solving and deductive reasoning. My only issues with it are the rather high difficulty of Skill checks (in my experience, a character asked to roll a stat they aren't strong in will mostly fail), and the limited amount of time the investigators get to do their investigating. I like the Time mechanic in the abstract as a way of moving things along, but I feel like misintepreting a clue or dawdling to check an extra room has swayed a game in the Keeper's favor too often. This one comes out when requested and when storytelling games are brought up.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Arkham Horror meets Descent and to some degree Betrayal at House on the Hill.

Investigators will do well to fear even the lowlevel opponents!

Very nice components and well done theme, as you would expect from a FFG title. However the storytelling goes a bit too far when combat resolution involves rolling dice for succes, and *then* flipping a card to determine any actual damage

You need someone who can be the DM (Dungeon Master) taking someone with a D&D background works really nicely and can smooth out the play really nicely.

Mansions is Betrayal at House on the Hill done even better.

I'm personally a fan of Betrayal but have some caveats about the game. Mansions not only applies a theme/universe that I am passionate about but amps up the component quality while reducing the fiddlyness of the entire experience. 

I'm so glad the game intentionally splits setup between the players and the keeps. This reduces front load down time by a large margin. It immediately involves all players. Another element that does this is the way the keep stays the moderator for all cards and puzzles that are revealed, and further the mythos cards that have to be played on the investigators turn; making the keeper highly interested in what the investigators are doing on their turn. 

Turns go by fast generally. The play time is listed as 3-4 hours and our learning game with numerous interruptions was 4. I can easily see this game being a 2 hour experience with our group, which is simply awesome.

I'm not sure how necessary the monster figs are, as they are gigantic, but I simply wouldn't have the game any other way.

There are complaints about two other things:

Errata: Yep. All FF has it. I don't have an issue with it. Generally if we cannot find the answer here we all agree on one until we find out the "correct" answer.

Story Telling: There is a story here. It's all theme. No it doesn't read like a book, or even play out like a movie, but it does serve to get players involved and they are interested to hear what comes next. The story does get lost while your playing until that next chapter comes up again.

I'm looking forward to expansions for this one in a big way and indeed I also see this rising to a 10.

Update:

Rating lowered to 7 when compared to the new edition. There's no going back to this, and for us that is amazing and surprising.

If Corey Konieczka had a mandate to re-implement the Descent dungeon-crawl system, he knocked it out of the park.  Moving a dungeon-crawl into a haunted house is a little ingenious and turns out to be highly effective.  The game has a great deal of complexity in its interlocking systems, but the complexity turns out to be almost entirely in the scenario design.  Once the player has actually arrived at the game, as either an investigator or as the keeper, the complexity is almost entirely gone, replaced by a streamlined and fast-paced experience.  Combat is more rare than in Descent or Arkham Horror, but also more brutal and deadly.  The puzzle system is even more fun than it initially looked.  But it is the clue-driven storyline that makes this game a real winner.

October 2011: unplayed. But oh this looks so good. This has been setup ready to go in a jigsaw board for 6 months :( kids are scared of it.

January 2014: So after 2 years, the game was still setup, so I decided first to paint the minis and then to solo play it since still no one would join in.  Worked ok, at the moment, Gloria escaped, 2 died and Kate is in the foyer with a load of baddies breathing down her neck,I think she will survive but it will be close...and then she died ! Cool keeper move to finish her off. 6 threat. She was in foyer, 1 monster already there but not in space. Moved in 3 monsters. horror check failed for 2. Attacked 2 hits, 2 health 2 sanity. 3 threat left.... Drew cards. "move 3 spaces" Yay. move her away, move unmoved monster.. horror check .. passes :(.  Attack, fail 2 damage.. gnawed to death by a zombie.  

Has been great to play, would need to big up the theme to keep the interest , still no one else is really bothered to play it :( I can't wait now, the first adventure really ramps up nicely! Love it !

RATING: 3
Has a strong odor of Descent about it with a little bit of the feel of Betrayal at House on the Hill except without the awesome parts. I am just tiring of the 1 player vs the party Dungeon Crawl type of games. I'll stick with players vs the system.

12-12-12 Update - I'm pretty much done with this type of game I think. It's too annoying to be going about my turn and then the "keeper" or "overlord" or whatever yells "STOP!" then I have to face the consequences of simply moving a space, and now my turn is probably over to boot.

After a couple of plays of Arkham Horror, I commented that that game would have worked better if it weren't a pure co-op, but rather had one player controlling the enemies. I'm therefore glad to see Mansions of Madness, which takes the Arkham Horror theme (Cthulhu Mythos) and puts it in a smaller scale setting.

Having one player act as the "Keeper" achieves a couple of incredible things for gameplay. Firstly, there's not as much confusing housekeeping following the scripted rules for monster movement, et cetera, which makes for smoother gameplay. Then there's the fact that your enemies are controlled by an intelligent player, which not only makes for a more authentic challenge (as opposed to being defeated by unfortunate card draws), it also gives the conflict more meaning. Lastly, the Keeper gets secret objectives, so there's an added element of suspense which makes the game more exciting.

There are some downsides to this game. The rulebook, as I've come to expect from games in this genre, isn't always set out as well as it could be, and after a couple of games we're still discovering things we've been doing wrong. Set-up time is considerable, in large part because the Keeper needs to do quite a bit of set-up in secret. These are minor quibbles though.

This game is great fun. The artwork is excellent. The inclusion of puzzles is innovative, and brilliantly executed. The stories are interesting enough to make you care, and the use of pre-written scenarios gives the game a rhythm and pacing that random-card-draw co-ops never have.

While this game is not nearly as good as arkham horror i really love the game experience!

Some comments on what others have said about the game.

1.) Yes, the setup takes some time. But as you get used to the game mechanics you can do it in about 30 minutes which is a lot shorter than sorting all the cards out of the expansions of arkham horror.

2.) The game gets a lot better with experienced players and keeper. When you know the rules well and have some kind of strategy on how to use both your monsters, threats and trauma (as keeper) or your characters as investigator the gaming experience significantly improves.

3.) Replayability. Well this is a tough one to defend. I have only played the game six times. Three as an investigator and three as keeper. And it does seem that once you have played a scenario you basically know what to do the next time you play it. But the game is still a lot of fun though! And hopefully we'll get loads and loads of "fan written" scenarios to keep the game interesting. And if not, fantasy flight seems to love expansions. 

In conclusion, the game has its flaws. There's no denying that! But i'll probably be playing this game in years from now. As long as there are some new scenarios out there. But i would guess that you will get tired of playing the same scenarios too many times since there are not enough variation in them to keep the game interesting after too many replays.

Nice idea for a game, terrible executions. Base game scenarios are mostly rubbish (my group found only 2 of 6 scenarios worth playing more than once), mechanics are not good enough to give horror feel (players don't care if something kills them or not - they get new characters which kills horror mood). Gameplay is boring, character moves to one part of the map, then other part and so on while Keeper tries to stop them. Basically, one could say that there is little choice left to investigators other than to move and take the clue as fast as possible running through monsters.

I strongly dislike co-op, dungeon crawl games like this one.  What made this one worse was that it seemed to be entering a scenario where you get the living you-know-what kicked out of you for two hours until you lose in an abysmal fashion.  

This game reminded me of a video game where you are given the illusion of making choices, when really you are forced to do exactly what the game tells you to do.  Any deviation from that path and you are punished severely.   

This may be a great game for some, but I thought it terrible as far as my tastes go.

Best storytelling board game I've played. Production quality is top notch. As usual, FFG doesn't disappoint. Some scenarios and keeper cards aren't balanced that well.

RATING: N/A
Horrific monsters and spectral presences lurk in manors, crypts, schools, monasteries, and derelict buildings near Arkham, Massachusetts. Some spin dark conspiracies while others wait for hapless victims to devour or drive insane. It’s up to a handful of brave investigators to explore these cursed places and uncover the truth about the living nightmares within.
Designed by Corey Konieczka, Mansions of Madness is a macabre game of horror, insanity, and mystery for two to five players. Each game takes place within a pre-designed story that provides players with a unique map and several combinations of plot threads. These threads affect the monsters that investigators may encounter, the clues they need to find, and which climactic story ending they will ultimately experience. One player takes on the role of the keeper, controlling the monsters and other malicious powers within the story. The other players take on the role of investigators, searching for answers while struggling to survive with their minds intact.
Do you dare enter the Mansions of Madness?

Aaand they're doing it again, after Runewars and Civilizations! Right now, my biggest complaint about FFG is that they are churning out their excellent, groundbreaking big games too fast for me to get enough play out of them.

Mansions would have been almost an automatic buy just for the toy value, especially since we're occasionally playing the Call of Cthulhu RPG (and I have tentative hopes for a Trail of Cthulhu session). But it is a solid game, excellent in places (the trauma cards and puzzles are high design points, I feel) and with a totally and overwhelmingly brilliant way of handling scenario setup: 

The keeper just decides on a couple of story points (like where the adversary is keeping the corpses, and what exactly the big secret behind all these mysterious going-ons is) and the game takes over from there. This leads to a very unique game experience where the first run of a scenario is a very story-driven affair for both the investigators and the keeper, since neither knows exactly what the story events will be, whereas subsequent plays get more and more strategic on the investigators' side and heavy on the bluffing from the keeper.

Even if you want to restrict yourself to the adventurous and atmospheric side of the Mansions of Madness package, you should get at least three plays out of each scenario, which means a total of fifteen plays for the base game - whether this is insufficient or quite a lot depends on your buying and gaming habits, I guess. Me, I've just enjoyed the fifth replay of the first scenario immensely, so I'm sure I got my money's worth.

3.2 £46. This game leaves me feeling quite ambivalent. THe production values are great, the characters and special powers are great, I like the DMing and story. I like the mini games. It runs quite long on a first game (3 hours plus 40 mins to set up). You can replay scenarios up to about 3 times due to different story choices, and I think that that's ok replay value. I have all the expansions and I need to bust into those now. https://youtu.be/WJ_fNdICfiA?list=PLEC54C070723F98E4

Liked it a lot in the beginning, but it has its disadvantages. Its very long to play, the downtime between turns is a bit high in my gaming group (maybe due to lack of focus, but the point remains). Also, after going over each scenario a few times, there isnt much to be discovered, especially that each of them is solved more or less in the same way. Its just a relay from point A to point B, throwing around keys, secret phrases or similar things.

The game was lots of fun, it has great miniatures and all in all is very impressive, but the replayability is a problem, and buying expansion sets isnt a real solution, as they suffer from the same replayability problem. Creating good and balanced scenarios ourselves is actually too much of a bother - our time is limited and we like to spend it playing games, not writing them.

Easy to teach players, but the Keeper has some fiddle bits to deal with. (It's FFG there's probably going to be fiddle bits)

This one is extremely story-driven, and so you should do. This Game is very easy to play for the investigators, and may be a toughy for the keeper player.


One word of warning.
If you think you´re smart and you play to win, then better avoid purchasing this game. You might be flashed by the first, and continued to be bored by the second game session.

If you like heavy atmospheric and story-driven games, and you play with the ultimate goal for every participant to have a blast, then this game is a must buy!

Completely dripping with theme, the game is full of suspense, not knowing what will happen next. The game is fun for the investigators, but more so for the Keeper as he knows beforehand what will befall the Investigators. Truly a game worth playing if you like theme-based games at all. The downside is that the game only has 5 scenarios. Well, you could always make up your own stories.

We need to talk about MoM.

The Good: It's a scenario-based tactical game of Lovecraftian horror with the usual FFG polish, a rich narrative, and brilliant gameplay that requires a careful attention to the story.

The Bad: Some scenarios are programmed brokenly, are of varying quality, and just plain don't work. Additionally, replayability is so-so once you've figured out what the key to each scenario is.

The Ugly: Set up time is atrocious, and misplacing even one card during the setup can render the game unwinnable by the investigators.

So, MoM: It's a mixed bag for sure, but it's still one of my favorites. You have to love the theme to get the most enjoyment out of it, and you have to be willing to have lost without entirely knowing why.

Looking forward to painting them up.

Two plays with 5P.  Great so far.

Update.  After 9 plays the game is very solid.  A nice hybrid of a role-playing game and a dungeon crawl of sorts.  The system is a great basic framework that can (and probably will) be expanded almost forever.  Creating a story is an interesting exercise too.

Unique in our family.  All 5 of us have created stories of our own.  Really brings out the creative part like being a DM in good ole D&D (not so much work, though)

I so wanted to like this game.  I love the genre and early reviews suggested that this addressed a lot of common problems with other games in the genre (where the monsters are randomly put together and there isn't a story.).  It does a good job at all of the above.  So why the low rating?

To start with all this configuration comes at a cost.  Every aspect of the game is extremely fiddly.  Game pacing often slowed down while chits were moved, cards drawn, combat fought (painful).  The clues were blatantly obvious (in line with Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego clues).  And ultimately just not fun.

I love this type of game (beautiful components, lots of fluff, not too abstract). The similarities with Descent are obvious and this is a good thing (I really like Descent). Some sessions have been exciting and close, sometimes not decided until the last roll on the last turn. Some scenarios are really problematic and can lead to very short games or be downright boring. Not sure if this type of game can be properly balanced for competitive play (I don't think that is a problem though, just something you need to be aware). After a few more plays I think the game is not tense enough and this is mainly due to fiddlyness and the problematic scenarios. There are also a lot of misprints and small rules issues that detract from the game.

Played 5-10 times. Scenarios can run long, at 3 or 4 hours, but we have enjoyed our plays so far. We use a lot of modified cards and rules as suggested by salty53 and others here on BGG. Some of them really seem to be essential modifications, and I really appreciate these users efforts.

Scenarios played:
The Fall of House Lynch: Investigators win
The Inner Sanctum: Keeper wins
Blood Ties: Keeper wins
The Yellow Sign: Keeper wins
House of Feras: Keeper wins, but it was close

I love this game so far (3 plays)! I've been a fan of the Lovecraft mythos for a while but don't really enjoy Arkham Horror as it's too repetitive in my opinion.

Hope this doesnt wear off after time

RATING: 6.5
Thoughts up to scenario 3.  I've only been an investigator.

What I like:
- Background story and flavor text is entertaining
- It's a fun experience.  We try to immerse ourselves and imagine one of those cheesy horror flicks.
- So far the scenarios seem relatively balanced as both the investigators and keepers are inexperienced.  Except for scenario 3, which only seems balanced if the investigators are already familiar with the objectives.
- Monsters don't block paths. You just have to evade them.
- You can spend skill points to mitigate the dice rolls

What I don't like:
- It's long.  I don't know what we're doing wrong. Scenario 1 took us 4 hours and scenario 2 took us 6 hours to finish.
- The interruption of the investgators with the mythos and trauma cards is annoying as an investigator, but I guess it is probably needed to give the keeper the ability to slow down the investigators
- The respawning of the investigators seems weird but I can't imagine the investigators ever winning without that rule.
- It's hard to heal damage/horror
- Dice seem to hate me
- Replayability? Much of the appeal of the investigator's role seems to be discovering the objective.

When I was a little kiddo I enjoyed making papercrafts.
One day on a comic I found one called "the haunted house".
Till this day (20 years after) I still have it.
A four stores building with a spooky garden entrance, that is split in half on the back, so you that can see each room.Full of monsters and traps(they could actually move),it was a perfect set for me and my cousin to play with.
I putted a message on the front door and from that point after he was running through those haunted corridors,trying to avoid any encounters (rarely)and find the next clue I've left for him.
And suddenly,all those years after,Mansions arrives in our hands.
Being both of us,lovers of horror and especially of H.P.Lovecraft,words are very poor to describe what we feel for this game and the hours we spend with it!

I'd had high hopes for this. But after a few plays it falls flat. Setup is crazy, its too hard for the investigators and they end up just doing the same thing over and over again. Gets incredibly boring. Other games do scenarios in a much better way that isn't destroyed by randomness.

Its got beautiful bits though...

RATING: 5.5
The perfect specimen of an ameritrash game with a deep theme and loads of fiddly rules that tries to accommodate it. It is essentially a Lovecraftian-themed version of Clue with some combat thrown in. Clue might offer more fun, though.

Restrictive in terms of actual choises for players and rules that makes little actual sense (why can you see the same cultist over and over and get scared every time you pop your head in the doorway until you are driven insane, yet happily remain standing whistling in the same room as a Shoggoth if you want to for turns over until he deigns devouring you?). Too reliant on luck--there are dice rolls for everything. Incongruent game mechanics with jigsaw-like puzzles thrown at the players now and then. Set-up possibly encouraging playing the dungeon keeper sadisticly, which can be detrimental to the gaming atmosphere. It is a board game that by its theme and heavy emphasis on story telling and character back stories suggests to be more that in is but fails to live up to that.

Very thematic game with great storytelling. I usually have a great experience with this game. My main complaint is that one player has to control the monsters, which is especially annoying if you plan to play with just 2 players. There are also balance issues with the "dungeon master" being essentially way overpowered so that he has to hold back to give the investigators a chance to win (and have fun). Still, I've had some really memorable and fun experiences with this game.

Thoroughly enjoy Mansions. I love the mystery aspect and the whole concept behind the game. My biggest issue is with the way the scenarios are set up. They are linear and only have a few choices to make them different, which leads to people knowing what scenario you are playing rather quickly if you've played them a bunch.

After play 15 we added all the cards from Forbidden Alchemy that work in the base game.

After play 29 we added all the cards from Call of the Wild that work in the base game.

This is a very solid 7 after one play, with full anticipation that it will go up.

I'm not a big puzzle guy, and the puzzle mini-game was slightly anti-immersive. However, it's something different, and the puzzles were easy, so it was merely annoying rather than a disaster.

I also wish it were a cooperative game against the system, because it would be likely to get more plays.

But all in all, it's a simple but immersive system that works and generates a nice story. So I'm looking forward to its imminent arrival via the postal service.

Acquired by trade.  Lots of silly plastic in there, I see.  Really liked playing more than expected, even if the first game went a bit slow because I missed a few details.  Perhaps the second edition makes it 'better' by putting players all together as a team and Jeroen tells me the damage is handled better, but I like the all vs one element, and I am very opposed to using apps in my games, so I am quite happy with this one.  Nice atmosphere and variety.  Only five games in the main box, but perhaps expansions will start to be more available as people switch to second edition.  That has helped me before.

RATING: 6
A beautifully designed game with high quality components. Thematically, the game is excellent. The countdown mechanics of sanity, health and the event deck could go a long way to create the sense of tension one would expect from a Cthulhu themed game but it fails to deliver that tension by interrupting it with instant "you lose" style mechanics. An unrealized horror is merely a surprise but the horror you see coming and cannot stop is truly terrifying. Ultimately the players are left unsatisfied because story isn't explained in any meaningful way to the players once the game is over.

A friend sums it up nicely, "Try spending half an hour setting up the complex “Green-Eyed Boy” scenario and then have the players lose the game in round 4. It’s jarring and doesn't endear gamers who are expecting a boardgame only to discover they're playing a "Choose Your Own Adventure" book with miniatures."

Es un juego descompensado hacia el guardián, el jugador que represente este papel debería ser el mas experimentado de todos, controlar el tempo de juego y contener las fuerzas de las que dispone. Puede en cualquier momento decantar la victoria a su favor y romper la partida. Al fin y al cabo es un producto que bebe de las bases de los juegos de rol, esto puede llevar a equivoco, NO es un juego de rol. El papel del guardián puede cambiar drasticamente la experiencia de juego.

RATING: 6.5
A great light-RPG.  A wonderful game for a handful of people who are not gamers (and at least one who is) as it is easy to learn (as an investigator) and dripping with theme.  The game itself is fun, but if the Keeper does a good job filling in story and setting the mood then the game will really shine.

The problems -- it is a bear to set up and if the mood is ruined then the game will be substantially less fun.

My wife even enjoyed playing this a couple times, but only for the exploration part. Friends enjoyed it too. However the long set up and clunkiness to the later scenarios have made me actually decline to play on more than one occasion.

RATING: 8.5
For a while we had a gaming group which played through these scenarios. It was great fun! Due to scheduling problems we no longer meet, but I'd be glad to play again any time! 

I've only really played this as the Keeper and found it challenging and enjoyable to play. There are definitely a lot of choices and things to keep track of to keep those pesky investigators in check. I'd love to buy more expansions but it does take a while to set up (~15 min) and play. More than a game, this is an experience. Put on a 1920's jazz album in the background, crack open a bottle of wine, and let the madness take you..

RATING: 7
Takes what's great about Arkham Horror (Lovecraftian narrative), and merges it with Fury of Dracula/Descent-like overlord mechanics to create a tight, thematically rich experience drenched in horror. Not sure about balance or replayability, but on some level those things don't really matter, since you don't play a game like this for those reasons.

Igényes játék, nagyon szép tartozékokkal. De tényleg, ha valamit ki kell emelni, ezt biztos.
A történetek nekem tetszettek, nagyon szépen kidolgozottak.

Ami nem tetszett 4-5 játék után, hogy azt írták, 2 személlyel is lehet játszani, ami igaz is, de azt kifelejtették, hogy az 5. játékot csak 3-an lehet játszani.
Továbbá ami nem tetszett benne (ezért is adtam el), hogy nagyon (értsd: NAGYON) sokáig tart ki- és elpakolni, illetve a limitált történetszám miatt szerintem kevésbé élvezetes az újra játszás. Hiába a történeteken belüli variáció (ami szintén véges), hisz már ismered a történetet. Ezzel nem is lenne baj, de a játék maga iszonyat drága, ezért elvárna az ember (én legalábbis) pár évnyi játékot.

Összességében: a játék nagyon szép, iszonyat jó vele játszani, a tartozékok a legszebbek voltak amikkel én eddig játszottam, de sajnos a fenti problémák és a hosszú (3-4 óra) játékidő miatt jobbnak láttam tovább adni.

This game is responsible for some of the best and some of the worst gaming experiences I've ever had. Enjoyment of this game is HIGHLY dependent on Keeper, Scenario, and Objective - if any one of those is bad, the experience is an inevitable disaster. If all three are good, there are few gaming experiences that can beat this game. A highly mixed bag.

Having played through most of the base game scenarios, I do have to admit that this game had not been tested enough prior to the release. So much wasted potential!

Wonderful Mythos adventure game. Players' decisions are simple, while the Keeper task is to play the Lovecraftian way (bad guys are there to win, not to be easygoing). A bit of care in the setup phase (and choosing the right scenario, they aren't all equally good), then it's all pure fun for a evening game.

Ich liebe Villen des Wahnsinns, kann aber verstehen, dass es einige Spieler gibt, die mit so einem Spiel nicht viel anfangen können. Denn in Villen des Wahnsinns, muss man sich auf die Atmosphäre und die Geschichte einlassen können, da hier die ganz großen Stärken des Spiels sind. In Villen des Wahnsinns spielt ein Spieler den böse Bewahrer und die anderen Spieler die heldenhaften Ermittler, die versuchen einem mysteriösen Fall aufzuklären. Das Spiel liefert unterschiedliche Szenarien, die der Bewahrer durch bestimmte Entscheidungen vor Spielbeginn variieren kann. So entsteht ein immer neues Spielerlebnis. Anders als bei z.B. Descent liegt der Fokus bei Villen des Wahnsinns nicht auf Kampf, sondern auf Detektivarbeit, Rätsel lösen und Erforschung. Fast alle Karten kommen mit einem stimmigen Flavortext daher und meine dringende Empfehlung ist es, diese auch zu beachten. Eine stimmungsvolle musikalische Untermalung (bei uns läuft immer der Soundtrack von Resident Evil), hilft die gruselige und beklemmende Atmosphäre zu unterstreichen. Die regeln sind durchaus komplex und der Bewahrer sollte von einem erfahrenen Spieler gespielt werden. Dann aber erwartet Euch mitVillen des Wahnsinns, ein außergewöhnliches Erlebnis!

RATING: 6
The Arkham Horror equivalent to Descent (1st Ed.), Mansions of Madness is very easy on the eye but very, very fiddly and at times overly complex.

As host (and most probably Keeper) I often find I'm  mentally exhausted after playing! There's so many fiddly rules to remember and enforce, and then I'm trying to plan my own turn and card plays on top!

MoM's unique narrative-strong scenarios also take a great amount of preparation and set-up before play. I often go through everything prior to the night, set-up the map, test the seeding to make sure there are no errors, collect together all the appropriate cards, monsters, puzzles and tokens, check through the scenario for what to expect, check online for FAQs to problems... Up to a good hour of preparation is in store for the poor Keeper! 

The miniatures and general aesthetics of the game are incredible. This is sobered a bit by an incredible asking price and what appears to be a surprising lack of gaming content considering the amount of stuff you get in the box. 

I think that FFG's boasts to MoM having lots of re-playability is a tall statement as a base game- when it comes down to it there's only five scenarios, all of which repeat maps and events with its limited set of cards and monsters. There's piles of scenario expansions to counter this problem, but this also makes it a hellish money sink too.

MoM is also well known for being peppered with errors, mistakes and bugs that often weigh the game heavily in the favour of one side or spoil the whole thing altogether! The Scenario 'Green Eyed Boy' is the worst offender, and is so bad even the map is set up incorrectly in two places! If you didn't know about this in advance you'd be screwed and the lengthy set-up would be for nought!

Sometimes it feels like there should be more happening as well- in the larger scenarios there is often very little occurring. Monsters are actually quite rare and pending specific Keeper Action cards some scenarios are lucky to see more then 2 monsters all game!

Its also quite finicky at times. Combat is exciting and dynamic, but because it uses decks of cards and you must cycle through to the next appropriate weapon type when an attack is made you often find every declaration of combat involves discarding through half the deck before you find a relevant card! I found that 'unarmed' is the most common attack my investigators make but there's only about 4 of these cards meaning you see each one 15 times in each game!

I like the Resident Evil style puzzles but they brake the game up quite badly and are awkward and inappropriate considering the rest of the game's pace. 

I quite enjoy the experience of MoM when it works, but I'm glad I only paid half the price for the game (got it second hand). When its good though its GREAT. When its bad its almost unplayable!

I've applied several patches, including corrected scenarios for the base game, card clarifications and changes to many of the cards and stories for balance and better play. Sadly my group still seems a little disappointed, mainly because they haven't grasped that the tone of the game is 'explore, uncover plot and avoid monsters' rather then 'kill all monsters and do that story thing if we have time afterwards'..

Progressive Rating: 9-8-7-8-7.

I pre-ordered this from Coolstuff.  I think there have been some errata on the cards since then.  I only played the game once.  Cards aren't sleeved (didn't get to it), but I did glue the minis onto the bases.  I thought pulling them on and off each game would lead to damage.

All the monsters are on their correct bases.  All the bits and cards in in plastic bags, except for some tokens, which are in a bead case.

RATING: 7.5
Reminds me of a blend between Arkham Horror, Middle Earth Quest and Betrayal at House on the Hill with a hint of Descent. This is not surprising given that those games are all within the FFG stable. As with those games, I would be careful to suggest this game to europurists because Mansions of Madness gets its fun from the willingness of the participants to get into the theme. 

From one play of Mansions of Madness I thought it was a fun, well-produced game dripping in its theme as is typical of FFG games. It moves at a quick pace with little downtime but it did seem to feel a bit dull somewhere around the middle and didn't quite have that nail-biting denounement that the other games I mentioned above seemed to have. This might improve on further plays and greater familiarity with the rules, which should speed up resolution of the game. 

Would definitely play this one again if offered. I think downtime might be an issue with more than 3 investigators, though and is probably best with just 2 (ie a 3 player game).

My play group love this game! Its so rich with theme and story! When I overlord in Descent I play hard. In MoM I play to provide the players with and experience, to tell a story, they dont always win mind. im not that soft! But I do like to let the story play out.

In all great game and with many expansions coming out I'll have to get onto picking up more as the only down side is the 5 Storys you get wont last long and once a player group has gone through a story twice there is very little chance they will want to do it again.

RATING: 9
Great Game and has been enjoyed and impressed all of my gaming groups (3 to date)that have played. They game fits into that nice 3 hour session and is very easy to pick up and at the end of the day most of what happens comes down to choice. Very little dice to roll (1 D10) makes for fast play. 

Only negative is that you have played a scenario twice there is little reason to play it again, and the game comes with 5 so your looking at 10 plays. Although if the group dies half way through a game i refuse to show them or reveal any thing of the story as to make them want to play it again ^^

There are a few inconsistencies in the rules that need to be addressed.  Know them well before playing, and determine how you'll handle them in advance or it slows the game down MASSIVELY.

The story is thick and super entertaining to experience as it unfolds during the game. Lastly, I do enjoy the keeper vs players aspect. It's fun for both sides and makes the game feel unique. I also very much enjoy the theme.

Like this game. Played Call of Cthulhu quite a bit when younger. Arkham Horror is just too long and drawn out - not very practical. Enjoy the flavor and mechanics overall, but I think the combat system is terrible. Turning over the same combat cards over and over again. It really mars what is otherwise a cool, creepy romp of a game.

Addendum: I just played it with some experienced board gamers, and the game was a delight. It went on for 4 creepy hours, and I squeaked out a Keeper victory at the end, but it could have gone either way. Looking forward to the Call of the Wild expansion.

This game is fun to play, but there are a lot of scenarios where the Keeper can at the very least make one key investigator useless (making that player not have much fun.)

It takes a long time to set-up and explain this complex cooperative game to new players AND it takes a long time to play as well.

This is a combat minis game like Descent, which I was most disappointed about as I thought it would be a cool exploration adventure game.  With that in mind I don't find the theme mixes that well, and player turns have large down time before allowing you to do a single action, and sometimes that action is picking up something you dropped.  This is not my idea of fun.
Beautiful components, but a disappointing FFG title.

One of best new games I've played in years and only game I've ever played 4 or 5 times the first week I've owned it.

BRILLIANT F##$@ing ADVICE: WHEN YOU PLAY THIS GAME: play it using the soundtrack to the computer game "Amnesia the Dark Descent" TRUST ME IT WORKS PERFECTLY. Make your own soundtrack by downloading all the tracks from youtube (provided you have permission from the publisher or whatever or purchase soundtrack)

THEN: put the tracks together making it so that most tracks (since they're made to loop and are therefore short) have the same track over and over again and build them up in order from most relaxed to most tense. So your CD will look like this

SONG 1
SONG 1 
SONG 1
SONG 2
SONG 2
SONG 2
Etc. This makes each track long enough that the CD is long enough and there's not too much abrupt shifting of moods. 

ANother tip as you play the game occaisionally rewind the CD a few tracks so that the epic finale in the game synchs up with the LAST track on the CD which I recommend you make "Daniel's Ending" works perfect to give a GREAT LOVECRAFTIAN feel throughout your entire game and makes a beautiful board game that's dripping in theme THAT MUCH MORE. Sorry for all the caps, just got too excited thinking about that and all the fun we've had doing this. It's worth the effort.

Best game of it's type, they can not make expansions and new content fast enough. Brilliant replayability despite the haters just within the base game too! BUY IT!

BEST BOARD GAME IN THE LOVECRAFT UNIVERSE

UPDATE: still a great game. Use the woman in black soundtrack for this game as well. Works well.

UPDATE: All expansions for this game are coming through really solid and the Amnesia a Machine for pigs soundtrack works wonderfully.

RATING: 3
I really wanted this one to work out – it seemed like a great approach to the whole Cthulhu thing, having the players actually play through a genuine prefabricated story, trying to unravel the goal that their enemy is constantly working towards. But it just doesn't work. 

The mechanics of the game don't help – there's nothing really inspired in the design here – but the real problem is that the actual plots make no sense at all, which just destroys the premise of the game. 

It was when I found myself spending lots of time trying to prepare for playing this game by trying to make the plots make some kind of sense, and changing flavour text to reflect this, that I realised just how badly this game was ripping me off. THE GAME IS BASED ON THESE PLOTS – HOW HARD IS IT TO MAKE THEM MAKE SENSE?

The whole thing just has the feel of being rushed to publication well before it should have been.

RATING: 7
Played both investigator and keeper many times and both are fun.

The scenarios vary a lot and feel very different.

The downside is that if the keeper focus to play to win it gets REALLY hard for the investigators.
It kinda ruins the atmosphere and immersion and becomes more about playing to win rather than exploring and investigating the "mansions" in a semi-rpg fashion.

But if the Keeper plays as a DM would (in a sense to give the players an enjoyable experience) it gets really fun.

I like the first edition a lot but it doesn't get any play anymore now that the second edition has released.

Mansions of Madness is a hot mess. There's one searingly brilliant idea present in the form of the plot/mystery scenario system, but virtually everything else about the game (including the execution of that core idea) ranges from "sloppy" to "fundamentally broken". You're incalculably better off just playing a single-session tabletop RPG (although you could loot MoM for story ideas).

Despite all the production issues, MoM is an AWESOME fun time.  There are clever and unique mechanics (puzzle solving and choose-your-own-adventure style scenario design).  It shares a lot with Betrayal at the House on the Hill, however Mansions brings much tighter storytelling and far less swingy.  Only one game out of 7 has been lopsided - every other play could have gone either way going down to the last turn of the game.

Love it.

Game components; board, pieces and figures are excellant, and well made.  The good thing with figures if so minded perfect for painting.

Having human Keeper allows for no 2 games ever being the same 

Looking forward to playing multiple player game.

I really want to love this game, it's beautiful and I really dig the Lovecraft theme. I also invested a fair amount of time painting it.  I pulled it out with one of my regular groups last Halloween and it fell completely flat. Partly my fault, I wasn't doing a great job as the keeper. Just not sure how often I'll get this to the table.

Reluctantly sold it after a year of disuse :(

Tons of counters, some minis, little puzzles, no more random placement as you go along leading to huge set-up time and lesser replayability, no betrayer but an omniscient overpowered overlord, not much teamwork since you often need to find the first clue to be allowed to find the second, skill checks, skill checks, more skill checks and soon enough, the realization that you're just bouncing in an impossible pinball machine.

RATING: 6.5
The closest incarnation to the vision of storytelling boardgames FFG's been striving to attain... and I wish I liked it more.

I don't dislike it.  There's a decent game here.  But it's a role-playing game.  It's moved from a boardgame to a RPG in much the same way that Descent slowly moved to a primarily RPG experience.  It just arrived there, fully born, from conception.  And again, that's fine.

But here's the thing: There's a Call of Chthulu RPG out there.  It's one of the best RPGs ever made.  And Trail of Cthulhu kicks ITS ass by eliminating CoC's biggest issue.  It's your primary competition, not Arkham Horror.  And no offense to your lovely figurines, your very warped boards, or your 900 little cards, but it kicks your ass.  Don't worry.  It kicks MOST games' collective ass.  It's an unfair competition, but that's what Lovecraft was all about: a lopsided, uncaring universe built to destroy us by design and the only thing keeping humanity sane is its relative ignorance.

What you've created is the CoC equivalent of a 4th Ed. D&D world.  Fair enough.  And if it's alright with y'all, I'll just play Trail of Cthulhu.

I like that this AH version tries to tell a real story, but I wish you couldn't see the rooms before you got in them. There can be some tense tough decision for a few players, but often too much of the game is played on autopilot. It's also super easy to screw something up as the keeper. The puzzles should be cool, but watching someone solve a puzzle is the worst thing ever.

A lot of attention to the details has been put into this game and it shows. The modular boards work just great and different scenarios are available.
If you have the time to play it (reserve at least 3-4 hours) and the right mood, this game is a good choice. The reason why I don´t give a higher score is because I think this is a game of its very own kind and for me, not the kind that I would like to play very often.

Our one and only game took two hours to set up and three to play: interminably long for the amount of gameplay. Gamplay itself was very short, but looking up all the rules and icons for the massive number of bits took forever. Way too many pieces and mechanics. It might be an OK game if it was tightened up considerably, but simply too much stuff for the amount of gameplay.

Love it.  Played twice in a row and want to play it again!  Components are all great, best FFG production I've seen in a while.  Probably does have re-playability issues but I enjoyed it so much I don't mind.

EDIT: Dropped from an initial rating of 9 to 7.  This game is only as good as its scenarios.  Played the first two scenarios and loved it, thought this was definitely one of the best games I've played in ages. 

Played the next two scenarios and one was very disappointing given how good the first two were, whilst the other was absolute crap.

Shame.  Don't think this'll get another look in for a little while now at least.

RATING: 7
First play was more crazy slapstick than horror. It felt like an early film by Peter Jackson than a gothic novel. I've rarely heard more people laughing out loudly when playing a board game. But no doubt, the game is very thematic and entertaining for the investigators in any case. The keeper, however, has got a tougher job. He's the one who absolutely needs to know the rules. And they are many, though they're not complicated. It's one of the most story telling games I have played in my life. How much would I want to play the game right now? Any time, as long a I don't have to play the keeper. But it's not the kind of game I would want to build up or explain to others. 

Also, people say that many of the scenarios are either buggy and/or unbalanced; of course, the game is about the theme and not the winning, but games without tension, games without a dramatic curve aiming at a close ending aren't entertaining either. I haven't played one of the unbalanced scenarios yet, but their undisputed existence is one more reason why I'll usually be willing to join the game, but never own it.

This is a tough game to give a review. This is a great game! If you are a horror game fan, then you really don't want to miss this. If you are a fan of Betrayal at House on the Hill, then again you don't want to miss this. In fact, this is a great 2-player game. If you have played games like Fury of Dracula (Dracula player), Scotland Yard (Mr. X), or Pandemic On the Brink (Bio-terrorist), where one player is against all others, then this is a similar experience. The components are excellent quality and the artwork is absolutely perfect. The box art is absolutely hands down irresistible. The stories are excellent and the mechanics of setting up each game are unique and actually quite fun. The game is really very simple to play. The rules are easy to teach and relearn. If you play as the Keeper, you can preset up the game and any new gamer could jump right in and play, with very little rules explanation. The game can be long, even though the actions are very simple for all players. Puzzles and other fun effects that happen in the game tend to make this game last longer than you expect, but not necessarily in a bad way. This game is also very balanced between the investigators and the Keeper...very enjoyable for both sides to play.

After playing my first game, I had a great time playing but was so disappointed that with only a set of 6 stories included in the game...this was just way too little. I worried also that replay ability would be quite bad. But here is what I have discovered so far. Each story has a set of questions allowing the Keeper to set up each game differently. There are at least 3 significant permutations of each story, I believe; this should allow for some variety of game play among the stories also. If you get on a kick of playing Mansions of Madness, most likely you will not play all of the stories back to back or probably won't want to play a story more than one time in a row. Even if you have a game group that wants to play this game often, I think it is possible that the locations of the most significant cards and clues could be memorized or at least anticipated to be in certain possible rooms, but I do not feel it will ruin the experience or even give away too much information. I also think that if the game were to sit on your shelf for awhile and you were to return to it in say 6 months, I would say you could replay all of the stories again as a fresh experience. 

For example: We played Blood Ties one evening with myself as Keeper, a couple of nights later played the Til Death Do Us Part expansion and about 1 week later played Blood Ties again with a new player as Keeper. His choices for the clues were different from mine, creating a very different story. Having been Keeper just a little while ago, I did have some knowledge of where possible clues might be. But here's the thing, when you look over the board you see where locked rooms and obstacles are, but if it is slightly varied you still have no idea which way to go. There was a point where I felt the final clue could possibly be in one of 3 possible rooms, but it was a tough decision for me, to which of those rooms I should concentrate my efforts. The other thing that occurred between the 2 blood ties games, was the stories created a different effect with monsters...for me that made the whole game totally different. I thought I went into the game knowing too much, but it turned out it didn't matter at all. Playing Blood Ties, then a different story and then coming back to Blood Ties, has a visual effect on you too. After playing just one different story between the 2 Blood Ties games, it really disorients you, because of the complete rearranging of the map tiles.

I cannot fault Fantasy Flight for producing such a game, as others have. This is a great game and I never could have guessed the replay ability would be this good. I would truly miss not being able to play this. I am very thankful that such a game is available, it is a great spooky romp through a haunted mansion...a theme of which I can never seem to get enough. I now, actually feel that I cannot see a point where I will have exhausted all of the variable options for all of the stories. I really have a blast playing MoM.

I have now purchased 4 mini expansions and the Alchemy expansion for even more replay ability. Not because I had too, but because it is that good.

After one play (Scenario 2), it seems the game favors the keeper.  Perhaps the game would be more balanced after a few plays, so the investigators can know the capabilities of the various monsters and what can be expected during a game.

Tentative rating after five plays. Fantastic bits. Very fun for the Keeper character, but for the same reasons playing the Overlord role in Descent is fun: because being a character isn't especially awesome, and/or you get one player who kind of "runs" everyone else. The setup system is genius. Love it! I just wish the secret fictional backstory had a better way of getting to the players than the existing system. Right now only the Keeper gets the whole story; even after beating a scenario, odds are good the players will have no idea wtf just happened.

Our chief weapon is the theme. The theme and the whacking. Our two weapons are the whacking and the theme ... and ruthless insanity. Our three weapons are the whackings, the theme and ruthless insanity ... and an almost fanatical devotion to the die. Before you die. Scenarios are the typical Arkham lot ... wander around a mansion, unlock doors, find stuff which will unlock other doors, whack an endless supply of monsters that will delay you while each encounter drops your health and sanity. Which allows the Director aka Malevelant God to pour more pain on you via cards (mainly by dropping your ability to pass die tests). The malicious God can have some fun as he knows what's going on and can pour it on. Turns for the rest are ultra decision light - move and/or attack, see what happens, roll a die to resolve. So it's all about the theme. Each scenario has lots of variable setup, which contributes to a *long* setup time for the Director, but allows you to play each time facing a new challenge. If you're happy to play for the ride, and happy for someone to Direct, and don't care too much what happens or that it's decision-light ... you can have a fun time. The problem for the rest of us that while the Director has lots to decide and do (creating downtime for the rest), the game goes waaaay too long when you have no interesting decisions and where you're continually waiting through the downtime for the Director to choose how to pound you. And all that variability on promise is a disguise for doing much the same things every scenario ... wander to one end of the mansion, find something, go to the other end and use it, then back again, rolling dice to resolve attacks along the way. I was fine when my first game took 2 hours. It outstayed its welcome the second time and dropped rating points at 4.5 hours when it was clear the theme is too thin a veneer over lack of substance.

"Decent core, but WAY too long (4.5 hrs), and I don't like the 1-vs-many structure."

What I like:
- Modular tile board is cool
- Narrative flavor is decent
- The fonts are slightly less unreadable than most FFG Lovecraft games

What I don't like:
- At 4.5 hours, it was about 3 hours too long
- The keeper seemed far too powerful
- It has about 70% of the complexity of Arkham Horror, which is far too much for a 2011 design

I didn't mind giving this a try, as I have moderately enjoyed Elder Sign and Eldritch Horror. I had no idea I was sacrificing over 5 hours of my life (including setup). For a game that I'm pretty sure would have ended with a keeper victory no matter what we would have done. When we lost (4.5 hours in), we were still *at least* 8 rounds from winning, and that would be if everything went perfectly. I can only hope that it would be shorter with fewer players, so I voted "not recommended" with 5p. 

I would be willing to try the newer edition that uses an app. Playing against a human took away a lot of what I enjoy in a co-op. 

I would rate the weight at 3.5, due to the many complicated little rules. I would give the depth about 1.7, on par with Forbidden Island.

Based on one Play: When you first look at the game, it is quite impressive, really nice components and presentation. If you are into these games, you will surely love it. The story setup is great since one player gets a chose your own adventure scenario where he can decide the objective and setup. My annoyance is when playing. Yes the monsters and story are cool and change each time, but at the end, everything is decided with a skill check, which is simply the roll of one die and this to me is really frustrating, since you really have no control or strategy. If you like a lot of story and theme and get engaged in the scenario, you will surely love it, just not for me.

Mansions of Madness si presenta molto bene, con una confezione lussuosa, componenti ottimi e una grafica superba (al solito, la Fantasy Flight ha pochi rivali in questo).

Il tema è molto ben reso e alcuni meccanismi, come il puzzle per aprire le serrature, il sistema degli indizi e lo scenario, bene si prestano al gioco. Sembra di giocare a una versione migliorata di Betrayal at the house on the Hill.

Purtroppo dietro c'è la testa di Koniecza (quello che ha preso la briscola, l'ha complicata all'infinito e ci ha tirato fuori Battlestar Galactica) e la mano della FFG (mille pagine di regole? Ci sono. Mille pagine di errata? Eccole. Quattro chili di materiale di cui si poteva fare a meno? Come no?).

Il gioco è terribilmente lungo da preparare e terribilmente lento da giocare. La miglior rappresentazione del difetto dei giochi cooperativi: un gioco per due mascherato da 2-5 giocatori, dove gli investigatori cogitano a lungo per fare due passi e un'azione a testa ma giocano come un'unica entità, l'antagonista che impazzisce davanti alle scelte a disposizione.

Com'è possibile che un gioco basato pesantemente sull'elemento di  narrazione abbia tempi morti così lunghi (e poco più che una manciata di scenari)? Da una parte lo sforzo - meritorio, per carità - di allontanarsi dalle aride meccaniche tedesche privilegiando la trama e dall'altra le stesse iper-arzigogolate meccaniche, progettate SULLA trama, che generano tempi morti che ti obbligano a "uscire dalla storia" per pensare a ottimizzare bonus e decidere dove andrà il tuo compagno a quattro stanze di distanza. 

Meccaniche che, tra parentesi, sono per la maggior parte dei casi riconducibili al giocare una carta, scoprire una carta, tirare un dado, leggere una carta, riprendere in mano un carta. Il tutto inserito in un poco originale dungeoncrawl.

Un'altra idea interessante come le carte combattimento diventa un boomerang che fa a botte con il tema: ho una buona mira e un'arma, attacco uno zombie MA la carta mi obbliga a fare un check sulla mia destrezza, che magari fa schifo. Ma perché? E poi, la sequenza fissa di gioco che rende macchinoso il passaggio di oggetti da parte dell'ultimo giocatore, i personaggi con un disturbo alla memoria a breve, che fanno horror check su horror check 

Non hai fatto nessuno sforzo per le meccaniche (che di fatto non hanno niente di originale, si trovano in tutti i giochi americani), almeno sforzati di adattarle al tema, cribbio!

Troppe, troppe, TROPPE regole inutili, complicazioni e casi particolari inutili, carte e cartine INUTILI. Tre ore di gioco complessivo, tempo effettivo di gioco 45 minuti. 

Mansions of Madness è un Betrayal con le penosissime regole di Last night on Earth. Betrayal, con tutti i suoi limiti di regolamento e di qualità dei componenti, batte questo ennesimo briscolone della FFG sei a zero e dura un decimo. 

Per dirla come gli americani, tanto flavor, ma overcomplicated, disappointing & fiddly gameplay. Delusione cocente... il peggior gioco, finora, del 2011: ridatemi le semplici meccaniche tedesche, domani mattina mi devo alzare per andare a lavoro, non posso fare le 3.

Only one solo play so far, and given that this is a decidedly multiplayer affair, I may not be in the best position to judge it's merits.  I did enjoy the one play I've had so far though and I can definitely see the potential for a fantastic game here.

The basic premise is a one against many game, where a team of players control investigators exploring a haunted house trying to uncover its secrets, whilst another player controls the evil forces present in the house in an attempt to kill or drive off the investigators.  The game is scenario based and comes with 5 scenarios each with multiple different branching paths which potentially makes each play through of a scenario slightly different.

Theme is king here and the game simply drips with it.  That said the gameplay is also solid but it's not going to burn your brain like Agricola for instance.

Have high hopes for this one, so hoping it gets some table time soon.

Playtime: ~180-210 Minutes

Comment: This game is absolutely dripping with theme. Really, that's the only thing it's got going for it. While it was a moderately fun game, the setup time on this game was horrendous. It took almost a solid hour to setup the first time. Easily takes 30-45 minutes each time after that. Plus I'm not fond on this game having a GM that's really not a GM. It's someone who can really be annoying so you're not quite sure to make it fun for 3-4 other people or make it fun for yourself. Ugh. I'd be willing to play it again if someone sets it up beforehand.

I love this game and would have given it a 10 but all the reprinted error cards and a lack of play testing got it knocked down a point.  Don't get me wrong, this is an awesome game overall.  It is very simple to learn and with the help of BGG set-up was easy, though a little time consuming.  I can only tell you from the Keepers POV but I got a few Non-gaming friends to try out the game and they love it.  I hope to see more (error free and well tested expansions) for years to come.

RATING: 7.5
Pretty good adventure game. Especially when playing as the Keeper. As with many adventure games - this game is as good as the group makes it out to be. Also it depends on the scenario played - some scenarios have better story and mystery feel than others. Replay value is a problem with this game - only five scenarios included and none of them are really that replayable more than twice as an investigator (no matter what some say). And while the plastic minis are great, it definitely lead to the lower variablility in monster types or number of investigators one can choose from (compare to cardboard based Arkham Horror for example).

Rating for playing as an investigator - 7
Rating for playing as the Keeper - 8

RATING: 5
An odd attempt to make a highly directed roleplay game experience. It seemed fiddlesome and overlong. Also the balance seems firmly set against the players, like a D&D game with a 'killer' DM.

Maybe as an old-school roleplay gamer this sort of thing doesn't sit with me well. I'd rather play a pen-and-paper RPG and have the narrative develop more organically than see it spun out with cards and book readouts.

The components are very handsome, though. I'll give it that.

Under all the atmosphere and backstory and characterization and shiny bits, it's like playing Doom except all your guys are pansies. The puzzle-solving is sweet, but leaves others out of the fun. Just like Doom, it's a timed race in disguise. Unlike Doom, you can't decimate a bad guy with a salvo of plasma rifle fire.

RATING: 10
Super fun.  A beast to set-up (but so is Arkham Horror).  My group feels more the the Cthulhu mythos in this game as compared to Arkham Horror.  The game has great pacing.  As in, the game starts out kind of slow with the investigators trying to figure out where to go, but the keeper can't push the investigators too hard because they don't have a lot of chits or cards yet.  That all changes as the players progress through the mission, and the keeper is frantically trying to kill/maim/slow down (or possibly make them change allegiances, I'm looking at you green-eyed boy).  Definitely glue your monsters to their bases, which helps speed up set-up.  Also, get your investigators involved in setting up the board, and handling all the investigator cards/chits/whatever.

This game really has a lot of potential. It has just nice amount of story and fun gameplay. The first scenario didn't use all the potential but left me wanting to play more. 

The components are crude as they have been lately with FFG. The board pieces are prone to bending, the cards are flimsy and the figures are of poor plastic. Also the rulebook is a mess. 

Still, the game itself is really fun and I can only see how further expansions make this game really shine even more!

I'm always the Keeper when we play so I haven't really experienced being an investigator. I always feel like I'm going to run out of stories to tell and that I'll be forced to shell out $30 to get more. 

Oh, if you miss seed one of the cards you're in biiiiiig trouble. The story could possibly lead to a dead end if you do something wrong. 

This is still one of my favorite games because I can be cruel to others and watch them try and solve a mystery that I created. The components are quite impressive except there are times when you can place more monsters on the board but you've run out of figures. It seems too easy sometimes.

11/08/12 - I upgraded this game from a 7.5 to an 8. It's really thematic and it always tells a cool story. I'm also removing it from my trade because I've grown to like it.

11/11/12 - Bumped it back down to 7.5 after a bad game of Green Eyed Boy.

I really like this game as a RPG without the effort (apart from painting the miniatures!)
I've got Arkham Horror as a solitaire game and probably would prefer that for two player. With more than two players then MoM is the better game with more player interaction and comments suggest that it will go to 6 players easily.
Ok, so some of the scenarios are broken, which stops me giving it a 10, but on the plus side i get miniatures and a set of rooms that I can use as play aids in an actual RPG session - should I ever manage to arrange one, so what's not to like?

RATING: 7
Not much strategy to cooperate about, and too little to hang a roleplay hat on either, but among friends it passes the time well enough.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The latest, and probably most successful effort at the "explore a haunted house" genre.

I come at MoM as an Arkham Horror fan, and although I can see where people find MoM more engaging, it's subject to greater fluctuations in luck and has enough differentiation in the learning curve (it's easier to "learn" to play the Keeper well than to "learn" to play the Investigators well) that I have, after two plays (one on each side), found it largely unsatisfying.

Its inherent advantages -- variability and flavor -- are undermined by the overall randomness and subjection to imbalance that so many possible scenarios have in a game where decision making, to be frank, is severely limited compared to those possible in an actual RPG.  The clue progression is ham-fistedly linear, though the game masks this fact by tempting the investigators into searching every room, not necessarily the ones the clues suggest.  But if the investigators do this, they tend to slow their progress so much that the Keeper can hammer them. The result (in my admittedly limited experience) is a game that seems to encourage open-ended decision making, but really doesn't.  (The room vs. space differences can also be a bit tricky in remembering some rules, and it's tedious to remember to do immediate horror and when evade checks are necessary.)

That said, many ratings of this game oppose my own opinion, and I've only played twice. The narrative is far stronger than in Arkham, the map and pieces are minis, not cardboard on stands, and the puzzles are a cool inclusion.

I'm trying to understand my preference for AH over MoM (a preference that makes me the outsider of our game group), and I think it's because I see more interesting decisions to make as an individual in AH, and its variations (though less flavorful) have a standard balance to them and allows for clever problem-solving (especially in a tougher game).  To wit, AH has "skill sliders", which make for far more interesting decision-making.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I can see the quality of this game: the searching for clues in different rooms and solving mini-puzzles to get them, even the fighting with a monster, it are all quiete nice ideas, but what ruines it for me is the 'Ameritrash'-factor of constant rolling the dice and checking a certain number on your charts. That made it too repetitive for me, but also for my fellow players.

I will admit that I'm rating Mansions of Madness a little high. The rule book is incomplete at best and the mechanics are wonky but the theme is solid and the whole set is a valiant attempt at something truly original. If you're willing to tweak some rules and create scenarios of your own than Mansions of Madness becomes one of the best "sandbox" games you've ever played.

What a ride! Played it a few times before owning it. We played at night and the game really got to us. There was fear and we got all emotional. I think we even got some nightmares. We are horror lovers so the thrills really appealed to us. The game's value grows with how willing the players are to participate in the story. It's 60% atmosphere. Lots of game materials and nice minis. A few scenarios are uneventful, but the good ones really suck you in. Love that the investigators discover their goals gradually and of course the madness mechanics are the best. Alas, it can be a bit long and the horror and evade checks can get tedious. The keeper can be a real stinker especially with inexperienced investigators. His benevolence can save the investigators some frustration.

Arkham Horror scaled down to a single property, and stories that are a little more personal (as a Call of Cthulhu Keeper I partially approve, but it does make it all a bit more visual, a little less left to your imagination, and the mechanics remind me more of a computer game where you need to piece puzzles together and find clues on a clearly defined map, which is less cool).

Lovely playing pieces though. As yet, never got a game of this off the ground, and suspect it might do better in the hands of someone who could find the time and appreciate the fiddly puzzle bits.

I liked it but there was just to much hate to go around.  THings people didn't like:  

The campaigns were crap.  Story elements and the follow the quest chain mechanics where dumb.  The scenarios could have had custom text for each room and even for finding different items and such without to much extra work.  The writes could really have gone to town on this without to much more effort.

The downtime/time spent just moving was way to much. We had one guy who spent the whole first half of the game just moving to the back bedroom only to find it empty and then have to spend the second half just moving al the way back around the house to find his friends.

To many of the scenarios have un-killable/instantly respawning monsters so there is little to no reason to fight.

The puzzles were annoying to most players, though I personally though they were quite neat.

In fact, this turns me off so much I will avoid all games in future made by this designer.

Mansions of Madness is both atmospheric and fun. Exploring a gothic mansion, trying not to get devoured by cultists and various other beasties is an attractive theme and nuggets of storyline and quirky little puzzles let you get into it all the more. Despite the limited number of scenarios decreasing the games longevity, at 3-4 hours a game there's plenty of gameplay!

The care and effort that has been put into Mansions of Madness really shows and really gives it the edge over other, similar, games.

RATING: 2
Mansions of Madness takes the GM : players interactions of actual RPGs, most notably in a line of descent consisting of DnD to Descent, and for my own comparison, the further offspring that is Star Wars: Imperial Assault. However, this game also has to incorporate the clunky mechanisms of Arkham Horror, and its sister game (in that thematically they tread common horror ground) Betrayal at House on the Hill. As such, there's lots of incomplete information where your actual goal is to do the hidden information, along with just so rules and clunky setup and a general sense of futility. In an RPG about horror and lurking doom, this is great thematically, but mechanically you should't be bored waiting for your turn, and then be bored IN your turn.

The worst aspects of the rules from Betrayal were combined with the worst aspects of the feel of Imperial Assault, and then dressed up in the recycled art assets of the Fantasy Flight properties. Almost disgusting, especially as it ends up being less than the sum of its parts.

RATING: 9.5
Only two words: PURE ATMOSPHERE. I can say without doubt that I was expecting a game like this one since years!
It is a mix of Betrayal at House on the Hill, Descent and Arkham Horror, but it merges the best of all of them in my opinion, with an astounding mix of flavor and original yet simple mechanics. The scenarios' structure is simply great and the way the game plays ensure also a good replayability, better than I was expecting - there are only 5 scenarios, but each of them has 3 different plots/objectives and multiple starting combinations.
Components are also really good: the artwork on tiles recreates the perfect lovecraftian atmosphere and the minis are awesome, very detailed.

With soft lights and a right (horror) soundtrack, Mansions of Madness represents an experience.

It enters brutally into my personal top 10.

RATING: 6.6
I don't know what to think about this game: if you play with the right people, you can feel the background (if you play as keeper, you can create an incredible atmosphere/ if you play as investigator, you can have fun in finding the clues of the story).
If you play with the wrong people, the experience will be very different (not in a positive way!). If the keeper plays too much aggressively the investigators are very likely to lose.
If the investigators are casual players (or not too smart), the keeper has to hold back, otherwise he will probably kill them in a couple of turns. In this case the game will be very boooooring for him!
My vote is  8.5 with the right people and 5.5 with the wrong people.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Game was somewhat a letdown. I really wanted to like it and probably will give it another chance or two. Still, the game has many balance issues and poorly made scenarios. Unless the Keeper chooses to "play it cool" the Investigators don't have a chance. Also the HUGE set-up time is a problem considering the length of the game (and I'm used to long set-up times, I play Arkham Horror).

The all-against-one-aspect isn't really a plus for my group and the lack of exploration is a negative. (The map is pre-built)

Not sure what to think about the puzzles. They slightly distract from the gameplay but I think the people in my group still kinda like them. However they are maybe too easy.

There are lots of good things in the game though. I like the fact that a single monster means trouble. No monster is a pushover, not even the cultists, unless you are packed with guns or a lot of muscle. In unarmed combat a cultist is almost as good as an average investigator. This I like.
Also the variety of monsters. And I mean the variety WITHIN the monster types. The fact that when you see a zombie or a cultist you have an idea of the monsters stats, but since they vary from monster to monster you dont know exactly how much does it take to kill one.
And monsters are scary. Investigators may go mad when seeing them. Especially if the monster is chasing the Investigator. The monsters are thematic gold.

And the combat. And the barriers and hiding. This game has a lot of gold in it but overall the game doesn't really work for our group. Still, I would love to see some of these mechanics in future games.

This is a game with a lot of atmosphere. Really rich.  It has a lot of little fiddly things and lots of little counters to deal with. I have been playing it solo and it is very doable.  You have to make a few changes, which I'll post mine soon, but it plays great. 

It is a mixture of a dungeon crawl, clue, adventure game, and role playing game.  

The only thing I don't like and why I gave it a 8 is because the rule book is poorly laid out and written.  It is colorful but a mess.  Just look at how many rule questions there are in the forum and you will get a clue on how messed up it is.  You can work through this though especially with the help of the forum, but come on, just stupid that the rules are so screwed up.  And an index with have been great.  

The game though is a lot of fun to play and I can't wait till I get to the 2nd version with the app.

RATING: 8.5
Unique experience. In some ways, a traditional dungeon crawler, on others - a mini rpg experience. Asymmetrical game, where one player is the evil Keeper, and others take roles of Explorers, trying to solve the mystery. While both parties have their own goals, the Keeper usually knows more about the game and thus sometimes take the role of traditional game master. It's up to him, whether it's good to bend the rules sometimes, for the sake of good story and tension. 

Beautifully produced, so many components, figurines, cards, tiles, a feast for your eyes. There are even actual logical puzzles to solve by Explorers. 

The backstories of characters are fine and scenarios are also interesting (with some, though limited, replayability), but it's not a top-notch writing. Still decent, though. 

There is a good chunk of rules to absorb before you start the game. It's best if the Keeper knows the rules and maintains the game flow. Most rules are clear, but there might be some rough edges you need to clarify with faq or some additional questions. Keeper, who sets up the scene before the game, needs to devote some time beforehand, to actually make this right - certain mistakes can ruin the game completely. 

The common consensus is that some scenarios are "broken", that is, played weird or that it's impossible/very hard to win by certain sides. I don't really see it this way. For me, each scenario is an experience to relive. Sure, you want to win, but usually, it doesn't matter that much. All the drama and events unfolding during the game feel far more rewarding that the simple "I win" condition. So if you look for just game mechanics in this, you might have problems with certain parts. 

It reminds me of Claustrophobia, which plays quite similarly and the mechanics are alike, but Claustro is a very streamlined version of Manions of Madness, without all the "epic theme feeling" crust.

I feel that there's a great potential in next expansions and PoD scenarios. Superb game.

The number one game on my must-play (and have) list. Finally I got around to play. I say finally, yet it has only been released for a couple of weeks, but it felt like ages.

I think it is a great experience but like many other themed games, especially the similar Arkham Horror and Betrayal, I found that it depends heavily on who your are playing the game with when it comes to the question of having fun or not.

Luckily, my group was a blast and we managed to steal the victory from poor Mark who had a hard time once we discovered the sinister plan brooding in the mansion filled with maniac hairdressers.

Still, a few things that did not convince me at first play:

A. The puzzles are neat and definitely a nice detour from the common flow of Ameritrash games but I think they generate too much downtime and feel disconnected from the other part of the game.

B. The customization options are too limited

C. In general, the number of available cards in one scenario (as in equipment, events, monsters) is too limited

D. I doubt that this game is highly replayable. I think the designer managed to make it as replayabe as possible considering the storytelling nature of the game but I cannot see this holding up after more than 10 plays (without expansions), which is not my money's worth

E. The scenario felt a little bit scripted and the choices were limited, especially once the victory conditions had been discovered

Apart from that, awesome stuff

I like it, but my group did not...they thought that the investigators did not have enough to do and/or the clues were too easy to follow. I personally like the feeling that you've got a limited amount of time to find and complete your objectives and have enjoyed playing as the investigator.  I suspect, though, that the enjoyment can really vary depending on the scenario, though I haven't played enough of them to know.

A bunch of peculiar characters with the worst case of ill fortune investigate different locations infested with paranormal and eldritch occurrences.

I need to play this a few more times, but so far this is a fun, yet difficult, deduction game.  I am still not sure how the players are going to win a majority of the time, as the keeper I found it very easy to be in a situation that would kill most if the players.

I wish it was quicker to set up and break down.

Love the mix of action and puzzles. The keeper can be a very overpowered role in most situations, but I feel strongly that this is more of a story-telling experience than a 1 VS All situation.

Glad to see new scenarios getting released in expansions fairly regularly. The ones I've played so far have been well-crafted.

I'm so glad I never got caught up in the conflagration the first edition of this game caused! Yes, it's got some errata and yes, Classroom Curses sucks, but as mentioned in my other reviews I love a game that tells a story.

As designated Keeper for this game (one day I'll play as an investigator) I love to try and aid that story by playing appropriate cards at appropriate times. I even wrote some strategy guides about it on BGG!

If it weren't for the well-documented flaws I'd mark this as a 10.

First few plays have been fun. Reminiscent of FFG's Arkham Horror, but with much simpler rules. Seems to be plenty of replayability, especially given the number of fan-made scenarios that are popping up. This is more an "experience game" than a strategy game, but it does present some fun decisions for all players. The puzzle mechanism is cute.

Finally got this game and finally played it. After spending so much time reading the rules and then trying to get through a 5 player game it was really fun. Had a few questions about the game that I will have to try and get answers on but good none the less.

I also think that it is funny that this game keeps getting compared to Betrayal at House on the Hill when it is nothing like that game. I have the original Betrayal and I love that game, but MoM is totally different.

Most excellent game, great mechanics, nice components and miniatures. Very well designed, smooth game play. Enjoyed playing the keeper, lots of options with set up of the story. The players had fun with the map and assorted encounters. The puzzles are an interesting mechanic to hold up the game play for the Keeper.

This is a fun little game in which the players follow clues around a mansion to try and resolve the mystery, while one player tries to summon the forces of darkness.
The game plays relatively quickly with fairly straightforward rules. However it is still rather fiddly with a lot of counters (FF seem to think this is the only way players will notice how good the game is). I'd certainly play this again but there are a lot of other things I would prefer to play.

05-06-2014. Rated after 3-4 plays in total. I like Mansions of Madness. It's a fun game in which one player plays the overlord and prepares a scenario. The other players try to solve a mystery.

MoM takes place in the Arkham Horror universe and uses (part of the) Cthulhu mythos. I think it's a fun theme.

To me, the game feels close to Descent, while the focus in this game is more on getting clues and solving puzzles than combat such as in Descent. I think I like the combat-oriented gameplay of Descent better. 

Regardless, I'll gladly play MoM. It's a fun game with very interesting scenario's. Personally, I just like fantasy/dungeon crawling a little better.

Feels very similar to, but an improvement on, Betrayal at House on the Hill; the story-based set up of the house, clues, and events provides a much great narrative arc and pulls you into the story right away rather than having to wait for the bad guy to appear.  Still a bit fiddly as you'd expect from FFG, a couple player aids would have helped.  This is what more what I wish Arkham/Eldritch Horror was like - it would be great if FFG made a coop that was similar to Mansion of Madness but on a larger scale of a town or global.

I enjoyed this one quite a bit so far in the two plays we have put in. The system is really fun, and I get that some of the scenarios may have their issues. The end result is fun though and as long as you have a keeper that will play a little more of a DM role I think most of it can be worked out in a logical way. The theme is fun, and on a dark halloween night this would be a blast.

Literally one of the worst games I've ever made the mistake of purchasing.  Setup time was interminable.  The game was extremely mediocre during play, not atmospheric at all, and mechanically weak and unbalanced.  The components (giant gray plaster cast monsters) do not mesh well with the board and cards which are in full color, which really takes you out of the game.  

Overall this is really just an awful game and I highly recommend avoiding playing it and would never suggest that anyone buy it.  Just awful in every respect.

--Mar2011-- Pretty, but the story seems to be fighting with the game for dominance.  My first play was one where the story won at the expense of the game experience:  and yet, after the fact, we were saying "So what just happened, there?"  Sure, it's consistent with the Cthulhu Mythos - but it's not compelling.
That said, we could do better in a subsequent play.  So there's plenty of room for my rating to improve with additional play.  But another couple games like this one, and I'll never want to play again.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Mansions of Madness is a good choice. It takes a few plays to get used to the system, and it's easy to be lazy and not read the cards ahead of time. But once you play a scenario a few times, it's easy to have your RPG gamemastering experience kick in, and see how well you can out-psyche the players and terrify them. Mansions has a *very* nice death spiral, in which the players are slowly whittled down, yet have the clock timer to deal with.

***

Interesting comment about scripting -- many roleplaying game scenarios are written in a scripted ("railroading") manner. Heck. Even the dungeons in "Dungeons and Dragons" are scripted: You can either go left through this door to do something you don't know about, or right through that door to do something that you don't know about. Yeah, those are meaningful choices.

OTOH, scripted adventures are the "baby steps" game masters need to learn before moving on to in-depth adventures. Meanwhile, horror roleplaying games have a twenty-year head start on horror boardgames, so many horror adventures, particularly Chaosiums's Call of Cthulhu adventures, are open-ended, but still have a flowchart style so the gamemaster isn't overwhelmed with possibilities.

So, hopefully, just because *these* MoM scenarios are scripted, doesn't mean we won't have *any* MoM scenarios that aren't. Unlike most boardgames, MoM (as well as Descent, most RPGs, and even CCG-style card games like Dominion) is a *system* and it's important to distinguish this component of the game from the "implementation" (ie. scenarios, quests, and actual cards that come in the set).

Anyway, here's a link to Chaosium's "Call of Cthulhu" roleplaying game freebie. IMO, *No* boardgame even approaches the depth and immersiveness of the CoC RPG, which also has some of the best horror adventures out there. You should be able to easily use the props (tiles and miniatures) of MoM in the CoC RPG game as well. Heck, that's a third of the reason why I'm getting this MoM.

But skip over the introductory scenario, The Haunting. It's too scripted. :goo:

Chaosium's Call of Cthulhu quickstart:
http://www.chaosium.com/article.php?story_id=87

***

I'm banging together a roleplaying game system that combines Mansions of Madness with Arkham Horror. Here's the overview:

1. Get a Call of Cthulhu RPG adventure. Chaosium.com has a free Call of Cthluhu RPG download if you're not familiar with the system.

2. Adapt the outside parts of the adventure to the AH gameboard locations. Investigators move up to two spaces then have an action, typically an encounter or an additional space of movement. If they are in a location which has no activity mentioned in the adventure, draw an AH encounter card. Use MoM's skill roll system and the MoM monsters.

3. Inside locations use the MoM game system. Either adapt an existing scenario, or make your own. 

For those who aren't familiar with Call of Cthulhu RPG adventures, most of the investigation takes place before entering the abandoned house. This includes the location of the house, history of the house, and hopefully better knowledge of house to defeat the evil inside of it. Even if you don't plan to play the RPG, the adventures are *great* reading.

***

The maniac "regenerates", so you can stock up on threat early in the game. Have the maniac attack the combat guy *before* they find the shotgun. Have monsters pop in and out of rooms to force horror checks. Reduce investigators down two one health then kill them off once the Objective is revealed so they're not replaced. Hammer one investigator until he or she is a burden to the party. Play Kleptomaniac on the non-combat character so he/she steals the weapons. Have the maniac grab samples from the investigators and get to the altar for more threat. Otherwise, you use monsters to delay the investigators until time runs out. 

Best way to win the game is to out-psyche the players. If you *really* want to win, read the cards thoroughly and study the map so you know how to use the decks.

****

I usually have one of the players help out with setup. Just hand them the cards and tell them which room to put them in. Speeds up setup, although canny players will know the "random card" rooms vs. the preselected ones. It's not rules overload for the players. The Keeper *must* have a good handle on the rules, but I've introduced this game to casual gamers.

The game *is* long by BGG standards, but not Ameritrash. I prefer it to Call of Cthulhu RPG since I don't have to be "nice" to the players. The rules do a good job on letting me be as eeeeevillll as I want without this boring "investigators survive" nonsense!

*****

And if you want the unpainted miniatures, there's the Mansions of Madness game itself. Metal monster miniatures aren't cheap -- two Shoggoths and two Cthonians would cost at *least* $40. That's half the MSRP of MoM, which can be bought from a OLGS for $55.

A mix of Descent and Arkham Horror, with a touch of Betrayal at House on the Hill. I played as Keeper the first time and really laid it onto the players as much as I could, weary of how you have to fight with tooth and claw in Descent to even dent the players. They were a bit unfocused the first few turns, and so I managed to delay them enough to win.

Comments afterwards were that replayability is questionable. Sure, you can vary the scenarios three ways, but it feels as if it won't be variation enough. One player felt she couldn't do enough with only two moves and one action every turn. Myself, I didn't think much of the roleplay, fluff aspect of the game. Sure, atmosphere paragraphs were okay to read out loud, but I was expecting more than just short descriptions and the main weight laying on game mechanical aspects - like how to optimize who goes where end does what before time runs out. Also, due to time restraints when we set the game up, I didn't read through every card on the board and was as clueless as the players what was about to happen. Rules were a bit tough to grasp the first play-through, but proved very simple and straightforward as we went.

The third game I played, one year later, seemed more fun than I remembered it to be, but quickly turned into a less interesting race - which dragged out to a long and not very stimulating session. It seems as if the Keeper has to decide whether to "roleplay" against and entertain the other players (not compete so much) or play it as a race - a mode in which MoM  frankly gets quite boring.

All-in-all, this is an okay title, but I prefer playing other games.

This rating is incomplete as set-up took much longer than anticipated.  Even after reading the rules twice and watching a YouTube play through, the game was complex and slow moving for a group of first timers.

I do believe that the game could be simplified for set-up by using word indicators on card backs instead of just pictures...

Slow to setup, but...

It's quick, intuitive, scales well from 2 to 5 players, and is wonderfully story-driven horror fun.

Does it replace Arkham Horror? Not really, it's a different game. Mansions of Madness is one small story, like having a single encounter in Arkham Horror. AH is much more epic, involving travel to distant realms and other dimensions, battling Great Old Ones themselves. But it's also clunkier, slower, and harder to play. I'm loving both games at the moment.

Awesome game, but it needs to tie up some of the story elements. For example - although a keeper may know why a madman is chasing them through the house, the investigators don't have any real clues as to why, even with all the clue cards.

Thematically, this is a beautiful game. I am a big Lovecraft fan, so that scores it some major points in my books. The map setups, the storyline, the mini-figures (which I painted), and the clues and item cards feel like they were torn from the pages of a Lovecraft story.

That said, while also thematically accurate, the Keeper (bad guy) has an insane advantage over the Investigators in almost every scenario. At the end of a few hours of play having 1 person win and 4 people lose is not fun. Especially when those 4 people had very little they could do to fight back.

My advice, if you do feel the urge to give this game a shot, is to use the new ruleset and cards created by BGG users and posted on the forums here. They do improve balance a great deal, but the Keeper is still likely to win.

Feels like the child of a pen and paper rpg and a board game. I wish there were more tabletop rpg options though, but it's only because I am a dm for 18 years and I wish to torment (and reward :D) my investigators more. Setup is painfully long, but it worths it. I wish the first edition would have a phone app as well for the puzzles, but other than these we can't have enough of the game. You can set up your own story with your own layout and rules if you wish to, which makes it my favorite Lovecraftian board game.

RATING: 6
I hear experiences with this game can be very uneven, and I can see why. My first and only play was a blast, however. There was a great atmosphere of foreboding, and it felt a lot like playing Resident Evil (with cultists, altar, puzzle-solving etc). But the second half of the game felt a lot like rolling a die repeatedly and looking up results.

Puzzle-solving is the brilliant innovation here, which might sound boring and tacked-on, but provides great immersion and a welcome respite in the gameplay. Investigators being kept in the dark on nearly everything also adds greatly to the theme, but creates replayability issues.

Not too geeked about owning this though because of all the errata.

A worthy companion to Arkham Horror! The use of a classic DM makes play very intense and dynamic, plus there is enough flexibility given to make up your own scenarios, mix-and-match theirs, or maybe even play in a campaign mode.

  Fall of house Lynch is a good introductory scenario.
  House of fear's story doesn't make sense as usual, but mechanics is fine. I justified the story as investigators were stepping into a trap and it worked out fine.
  Green eyed boy scenario sucks ass, it drags too long(6 hours), even fan-fix couldn't save it.
  Further thought: fix for GEB fanfix2.0: 
  Allow only the investigator closest to GEB get to choose the outcome(instead of voting), so traitor can do something significant, and it saves a lot of time. 
  Remove four if not all event card backs and the barrier marker b/t Hallway 2 and Study, in our game players spent a lot of time running from one side of the mansion to another, it took them about 4 or 5 turns to do so, even then they have 5 turns left to finish their final objective before final event revealed. The whole game felt eventless and clunky, this should fix it. One other complaint is as the keeper I don't get many monsters except zombies, but this might be different in other objectives? Also the story is still weird, the whole thing about butler and freezer and all, kind hard to justify.

This is probably my favorite cooperative kind of game. I figure good "DM" also helped when we played it. A little bit on the long side but at least suspense is good and things you do are actually meaningful, unlike many other similar games. A lot of the time unfortunately it's pretty obvious what needs to be done, so it can become an interactive book ("if you want to attack the dragon, go to page 53. If you want to run away, go to page 37") for 3 hours if you are unlucky.

This is a weird one. It's a game I enjoy playing occasionally - a friend that owns it lets me play as the keeper (or pushes me to play the keeper, depending how much I feel like playing this) - but I'd never buy it. 

So let's start:

Why will I never own it?
Because I think it's a bad product:
1. Replayability is very low. Base game has 5 scenarios with very low replayability (don't play the same one twice in a row), Alchemy expansion has 3 more and Call of the Wild 5 more. Now CotW has scenarios which are not so linear and are more about keeper bluffing the players, so there's some replayability there. Then again it's not one of those games you'll play very frequently. Actually the game doesn't want you to play it very frequently. 
2. The set up time is ridiculous. 60 minutes. No joking. If you organize the components very well you might get it to 30 minutes. One of the offenders here are miniatures which won't go in the box if you put them on stands. As a keeper I'll also need some time to understand what this particular scenario wants of me. Because the time investment of game + set up + preparation (thank god for BGG player aids - FFG why don't you make them?!) this is a game I need some convincing to play. I tend to like it while playing, but takes a while to get there. 
3. The game offers very little return for monetary investment. There's a huge amount of unique items that will only be used in certain scenarios, or only in certain options within these scenarios. And I'm okay with a shitload of cards, but there's a huge amount of plastic minis that don't ever see play. I've played 8 scenarios so far and once I actually managed to get eldrich horror into game (because it was Call of the Wild and they figured out we should get some of this monsters actually in the game). 
4. With all this variabilty the games get kinda samey. Investigators must go from point A to point B to point C to point D. And me the keeper will put bad stuff in the way to delay them. That's the strategy. Base game and Alchemy do have too linear scenarios. But CotW fixed it, at least for those 4 scenarios out of 5 (one is with no keeper, now that's just ridiculous...). 
5. You need Call of the Wild. Seriously, you do. It's that much better. Which just means you need even more money to get started. 

Why I do like to play it and I do enjoy it: 
Atmosphere.
That's it. It's hard to say narrative, but atmosphere and theme immersion are the only thing that the game has going for it, but here it deliveres big time. Essentially it's expensive idiot proof RPG. Preparation time is still shorter than in proper RPGs and there's no creativity required. So when you need something like this (for people who never RPGed, for when you can't find somebody with enough time on their hands to be a GM) it will deliver.   

What I would rather own instead: Betrayal at the House on the Hill. Simpler, much more replayable, and more mindlessly fun. 

Still I do enjoy my time as the Keeper. Mwahahaha! (my success rate is 75%)

EDIT: It's a game with low replayabilty and highly procedural with a long set up time. Great if you like eyecand and so-so if you don't (I don't). It does what it promises to do, but it's just too maintenance heavy.

Great game. Wonderful miniatures. I really like that not all of the monsters of the same type have the same hit points i.e. not every zombie has 7 HP. They also include a decent mechanic to keep the scenarios somewhat fresh by allowing some variation in item/objective placement. The only real complaint I have is the setup and take down time, but what can you expect with so many components.

Overall this is a fun game, there are some game mechanical issues that weren't play tested. You can find several forum posts dedicated to this.  This game is defiantly not for everyone and it seems that you either love it or hate it.  My main gripe is the time it takes to setup the map (If I didn't preplan it can take almost an hour). It's also frustrating you attempt to play a bad scenario. I recommend reading the detailed reviews before buying and playing the game.

RATING: 2
I like the idea of solving the puzzles to get in the locks, while yes they are exceedingly simple I think the mechanic is interesting. The set-up time, which I understand they fixed in 2nd ed, is far too much. What I really don't like (besides it's an overlord game) is that the investigators are wandering around aimlessly unless they happen to bump into the clues in the correct order. I've been told that I'm the kind of player who likes going in with a plan, and that's fair, and probably why when I play this I feel like I am just bumbling around in the dark.

RATING: 6
Finally re-rating after another play. It really is a great game, and its uniqueness absolutely makes it a keeper (ba dum dum tssss), but after a bunch of plays with several different styles of playgroup, I can honestly say that the biggest problem here is setup time.

Comparisons to Betrayal at House on the Hill are inevitable, and that's really the biggest issue here- while Betrayal derails the immersion for an extended break after the traitor reveal, you've already been playing and having fun for quite awhile at that point. The level of immersion and strategy is *far* deeper with MoM, but you need to wait *so* long to get into it because of the fiddly setup. The payoff is worth it, but it's really hard to table and that's what keeps it from crossing over to an 8 for me.

Includes the Yellow Sign POD expansion.

8 Expansions

RATING: 8
After my first play, this is an 8. However, I see this one falling fast if an expansion does not get released soon. Five scenarios just is not enough to get much play out of this expensive game. I love the atmosphere the game created (minus the puzzles which slow play to a halt, perhaps the one minute for puzzles optional rule helps here?). 

I fear that trying to replay scenarios as an investigator that I have already played as the keeper will result in them falling flat. I hope it isn't true, but it seems as if it will as I will have read each of the conditions for victory. I won't know what the Keeper picked, but I will have an idea as to what I need to do and where I need to go. 

Hopefully, some of these issues will be alleviated with further play.

The setup takes ages and includes finding and placing a bazillion of cards and tokens. It doesn't help that the game doesn't come with a thought-out insert (or any insert at all...), making the setup even more annoying. The rulebook is good at explaining everything in detail, but is terrible if you want to look up something because it essentially reads like a novel.

Nevertheless, once the tedious setup is done (and you have the errata printed out) this game offers great fun (except for scenario 4, which plainly sucks).
However, if you are not a fan of story-driven games, then this game is definitely not for you.

Update: With the Call of the Wild expansion, this game improved tremendously.

I love H.P. Lovecraft, and I love board games. So this is clearly a win for me. The Games Master mechanic adds a nice level of tension and (hopefully) intelligence to the movement of the bad guys. However I think as a design decision the game actually favours the GM over the adventurers, which if you Love Lovecraft, you'll know is very in keeping with his 'doomed' protagonists. However, if you're not a fan it can be irksome. Other major downside would be how long it takes to set up, however I think the game is worth it. Full review on my blog here:

Gave this another try finally, after a really anticlimatic first game. This time around, all went very smoothly and we all had a lot of fun playing. 

Setting the game up is a tedious task, but eventually really rewarding. I only played as keeper so far, but loved every minute of it. 

We tried to set the mood by using some background music, which in my eyes was a great success. Can't wait to get it to the table again.

Challenging coop game where every turn and every decision really adds up and matters! Waste too much time and you will see the effects of your decision in the late game. That being said, it's not always easy or clear what your current decision SHOULD be, because sometimes you are forced to explore and investigate in order to obtain your objective! Good replay-ability.

I'm kind of surprised that I enjoyed this. Like the other Cthulu/Arkham games, there's a lot of theme but not a huge amount of game. Roll the dice, see if you beat a number, and get random items.

After two games, I'm not enjoying it that much.  I admire the effort made to streamline a complex game and, in large part, it seems to work well.   The "story" that unfolds just isn't that compelling.  The game crosses too far into RPG territory for me.  Not that an RPG is a bad thing, I just think playing a straight-up RPG with this theme would be much more satisfying than what this boardgame is serving up with 30x the maintenance effort.  My opinion could change with a few more plays.

Originally this was higher on my trades list, but it has since dropped since I've picked up other games with high quality miniatures and mapping such as Descent 2.0...  Considering that there are only 5 scenarios in the base game, and that one of them is reported to be broken (although it may have been fixed in Erratas, I dunno) - it seems as though gameplay for this might be harder to get going.

Low on my wishlist.

1 play, good guys

A semi-cooperative one-vs-many game in the Cthulhu mythos, with AWESOME monster miniatures!

The Keeper plays against everyone else. Each side has their own objective to win the game, although only the Keeper knows what those are initially! The Investigators (MANY available from which to choose, each with variable character attributes, and starting items and/or spells) must explore the mansion, find clues, and achieve their objective before the Keeper does. Those clues are either simply informational cards, or puzzles. The puzzles are actual, physical puzzles that must be solved alone by the person encountering them. They all involve moving tiles, changing position or orientation, to achieve the desired solution.

Pretty fun, but some annoying things here, too:
- a lot of downtime for the Investigators, especially if someone is trying to solve a puzzle -- no one else is allowed to say ANYTHING!
- combat involves a whole lot of searching through a deck of cards, one by one ... boring!
- LONG setup

Not sure how much of an improvement over Arkham Horror this  is in terms of play length.  It isn't really all that quicker, and it's much simpler.  

Still, I *love* the hidden information aspect.  It makes the game grip me much, much more than AH and adds a real element of fear and risk that's totally lacking in the other game.

Also, the real possibility of player elimination is a big drawback -- I don't see myself agreeing to play again if that's even remotely possible.

RATING: 8
Very cool, this game is essentially Descent in the Arkham Horror universe.

One player takes control of the monsters and the dungeon and the players attempt to solve a mystery and otherwise fulfill the requirements to pass a mission.

There's a lot of theme to bite into here.  Each of the scenarios is full fleshed with different clues leading you to others, items and monsters that tie into each of these stories, and options provided to the "Keeper" that branch the story out in different directions and give him lots of fun stuff to do.

The most novel and one of the most fun mechanics in this game are the puzzles that you can solve to overcome obstacles and unlock certain locks in the game.  These are essentially different flavors of sliding puzzles but it's a neat little mini-game that really makes it feel like one of those old Sierra mystery adventure games.

I worry that the content is a little lacking, there are only 4 or 5 different scenarios in the base game and while there are some small variations and branching paths the Keeper can take, playing the same scenario multiple times would lose some of its luster.  This is, of course, a system that you can build your own scenarios into.  I'm not creative but others are and you can find homebrew adventures right here on the Geek.  But I'm sure everything doesn't fit in as nicely scripted in a home-made campaign with the same content.

I thought I was getting sick of co-op games, so glad we played MoM for Halloween game day, besides being so much fun it showed me that I still can enjoy the cooperative play if it is in the right game (for me). I especially liked the puzzles and storytelling aspects in here, it creates a unique experience and is oozing theme. It is a game I don't want to see on the table much yet I loved playing it, my reasoning behind this: big chunk of the fun was learning the story, the exploring of the unknown mansion, even with the different scenarios I think that effect could get lost for me if played too often. It would be great to get this out maybe every 6 months, other gamers surely think differently about that and want to play it more often in order to beat the game master.
I do enjoy it quite more than Elder Sign, less dice chucking usually works in my favor, I think this one is more thematic, too.

Tentative rating,

After one play I wondered why the keeper did not just read a Lovecrsft short story to us and we dispensed with the long set up and scripted play.

Entertaining but pointless - howevever, it looks nice the story was entertaining so will give it another go.

Second Play. Pleasant enough, some tension, some atmosphere. However, feel the same way as first play

This is a narrative game in which the playerts go along for the ride. As such computer games do this so much better than board games - the set up takes ages, info that would be better hidden is not, for so much material the choices are trivial. Would much prefer to play Descent or Arkham, Arkham the Keeper v player is more acute. In Arkham game play is a little more open ended. 

The puzzles? Annoying in the extreme,v low replayability, and no replayability for the colour blind. The sort of thing I found annoying in early 1990s computer games.

Interesting game.  It uses an "overlord" similar to Descent to run the baddies and the plot.  The other player characters play the role of adventurers taken from FFG's Arkham Horror game.   Players explore a modular mansion to find clues on how to stop....something.  As they explore, stuff happens and the adventurers get more and more freaked out as measured by sanity tokens.  They will most likely also be taking wounds as maniac or zombies or some other horror gnaws/claws/chops/bites the heroes.  The heroes can move, and then get an action which can be run, explore, use and item or attack.  The "overlord" can then act, moving attacking and other stuff.  I don't know what the other stuff is as I only played a hero while someone else ran the overlord.

Unlike both Arkham Horror and Descent, this one can be played in 2 hours.  It has ample replayability by building in a random set-up element in addition to the modular board.  The combat is largely diceless although there is ample D10 based skill checks.  These skill checks can range from attacking to entering a burning room.    The game played quickly, was immersive and had an interesting story.  I can see this game gathering a following similar to Arkham Horror.

Very good game.  Replayability is the issue with this game.  However, I haven't played the first few missions in several years and this means that I have forgotten them.  You need expansion material and set up is a huge pain.  Otherwise, I would rate it even higher.

The metaphor I like to use to describe this is: Arkham Horror and Descent hook up and have Rosemary's Baby. One of the few games I have more fun playing as the GM, than as one of the players. Perhaps the best play was the very first where the players killed themselves on, like, turn five, when then opened a cabinet they thought I was trying to keep them away from. Hee-hee...

This game is freakin' awesome. It absolutely requires a fair-minded RPG GM type Keeper...but following within the established rules and common sense, you truly get to attempt to achieve TPK (total party kill). The keeper must prepare beforehand, just like a real GM before a role play session, but the rewards are immense.  There are some scenario objectives which shouldn't really be played with being rewritten, but MOST of the base game is pretty well balanced.  The writing could be better and deeper for even more of a Call of Cthulhu role play feel, but even just stock the stories are good...read everything with appropriate feeling of course...but the Keeper is an experienced GM, so it shouldn't be a problem right?

Seriously, if you want the role playing experience, with a fun game on both sides of the GM's screen,  AND you want a full game in less than 3 hours, you simply cannot do better than this.

First impression: "Those minis look WAY bigger in person!!"  In fact, "minis" hardly seems like the correct word for them.  Maybe "maxis"?  (No, ewwwww...)  Anyhow, what started out as a bit of an overall "meh" feeling in the first turn of the game ended with a tense, adrenaline-filled finish as we sought to unravel the mystery of the scenario.  By the end of that first play, I was hugely impressed with how the game threw the investigators into this house with almost no knowledge of what was going on, with how the clues helped them to find some direction, with how the investigators had to talk amongst themselves to attempt to decipher the mystery and to work out their various options, and with the overall atmosphere of mystery, suspense, deduction, and cooperation that the game produced.  If I could say anything negative about the experience, it is that the movement around the house (and the subsequent unraveling of the mystery) felt much too linear.  Even though the map gave the initial impression of a large house with a lot of rooms to explore, the way in which the rooms were connected left a very limited pathway for the characters to follow. I would have preferred a much more "open" space for the investigators to explore rather than a "find a locked door, then a key to that locked door, then another locked door, then another key for that door..." and so on.  Perhaps other scenarios are more open-ended, but I felt somewhat too "channeled" in this one.  As for the components, in typical FFG fashion, the minis are spectacular.  The board looks great, although I wish the doors and blocked areas were more clear at a glance.  In other typical FFG fashions, the card text was frustratingly miniscule, and there was too much of a reliance on dozens of tiny cardboard bits rather than on charts or the more newly fashionable dials that could have made upkeep less tedious.  It certainly appears that just setting up a scenario would be a mammoth undertaking and that the keeper player has a veritable plethora of details to keep track of, although once the game is under way, play is relatively simple for the investigator players.  In a nutshell, this game feels like a much more structured Betrayal at House on the Hill to me, which is a very positive thing.  This is a game that I would have very likely picked up 3 years ago, but what prevents me from purchasing it now are 2 young children and a mortgage that keep both my budget and my playing time very limited, and which unfortunately mean that it could be months before I find the time commitment required for a play of this very fun game.  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 4/5  Total: 8/10

Great theme play.  Easy to learn and play.  Still on the fence.  I don't feel as though I was able to explore the mansion, and both scenarios seemed impossible.  Had no chance to win on one scenario and the other had a merciful GM.   Components excellent - mounted modular boards, thick cardboard chits, plastic playing pieces and durable cards.  Rulebook in color and clear.  Game length was good at 1.5 hours.

For me, this game thematically checks all my boxes. I love the minis, I love the stories and the Lovecraftian style, and most importantly, the gameplay is very smooth. I personally like playing the role of the mansion more than the investigators, but both roles are quite fun. Once you've done all scenarios (some are certainly better than others), a few of the situations feel pretty dried up if you're playing with a consistent group. Overall, I really enjoy breaking this one out with the right crew,

Holy cow!  There's a lot of stuff in this box.  I'm in awe of how many counters they crammed onto the sheets to be punched out.  Plays more quickly than I expected.  For a first game with two players plus a keeper I was expecting to clock in around three hours or more, but we finished in about two, and that was *with* rules explanations.  The setup time for the game is on the lengthy side, but that's about the most scathing thing I can think of to say about it.  Very good game!

RATING: 7.25
Great game with simple rules but a lot of atmosphere. Unfortuantely, the current scenarios are pretty horrible. Either nearly impossible to win without having played it before (instant death cards with no returning and/or instant losing are just stupidly bad game design) or just annoyingly boring (spreading fire and darkness tokens just to hamper people).

The game really needs a huge pack of scenarios you can buy, as they are currently way overpriced and the quality is definitely lacking.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
This game has beautiful artwork and story line.  That is all.  

The game is horribly unbalanced. Several of the rules are flawed and many issues are unaddressed.  Any number of monsters fit in a room despite size.  Cultists create sanity checks for horror when they are merely just bad people. Monsters can walk freely through investigators but investigators suffer attacks of opportunity if they want to move through or even leave a space with a monster without attacking.  Plus more...

The tokens don't make much sense, the sanity damage tokens are singles but the physical damage have values, which I guess helps keep track of monster health but is cumbersome when trying to find them in all the mess.

The pieces are excellently sculpted. But while made of a durable and flexible resin, the softness of the materiel allows them to bend making painting them impossible since the paint will flake off, and if left in heat, like the car, they will flex and sag and stay deformed.  Also they never seem to stay on their bases and due to their flexibility makes gluing them to their bases nearly impossible as well.

RATING: 1
How in the world do you rate this game? Its got cool minis you aren't supposed to paint. Its got fast play but agonizing setup time. Monsters have neat variety for what they do in combat, but are bafflingly the same outside of a fight. Characters have lots of options, many of which don't matter. It drowns you in flavor text while practically fighting against actually producing immersion or narrative. Played with a keeper playing as a "GM" it can be incredible fun. Played competitively, like its supposed to be, it looks like the game could easily collapse with a variety of degenerate strategies in some cases, while games would be pathetically hopeless for the keeper in others.

Story 4 made me lower my rating. Losing sanity due to boredom is not a good simulation of the Cthulhu mythos.

Story 5 dropped my rating to a 1. Broken in multiple ways. I mean completely broken - the scenario we played, the Keeper cannot possibly accomplish the objective (unless the investigators randomly decide to do it for her).
+1 vs. Team+

I enjoy this game as a player, but for a good challenge it requires a knowledgeable GM to control the Mansion and its trappings.

This game suffers greatly from many little rules that does nothing for the game except slow it down.
The monsters are many and have all different attacks and rules, and players have different things they can do, and different things can happen, and there are several conditions (like darkness) and items that counter that condition. But all of those things are just minor variations of the same thing (special attack of zombie 1 does 1 more damage than special attack of identical zombie 2, but that requires a different test than zombie 3. All these things just add up to a bunch of little rules that slow the game down without adding anything to the game.

The game is also seriously flawed with the whole role playing game and competative game hybrid. The game master tries to do his best to win, but he knows the victory condition for him and the players, but the players does not know their victory condition. The game master knows everything that is going to happen, but the players does not know anything. So it seems like a good game master can plan for everything, but the players just have to end up doing random stuff that seems good without any knowledge. Also one of the characters has a broken ability that is: Roll a die, if you roll low you win the game (you get to know your objective of the game which you should not know until you have explored the whole house several turn later) And this you can do at turn one, which actually means that the game can be over before it even begins. (Turn one use ability ->success->Do objective which might be do an aciton in the starting position->Win at round 1)

But if you just want to mess around, roll some dice and do a little role play on a board without caring about winning at all it can be a fun game. (But then I would rather play the role playing game)

I love Ameritrash game, as long as the "Ameri" half has the upper hand on the second word...

This game starts from a wonderful idea: let's mix Arkham Horror with Descent. The problem is that, just like Descent, it seems to have been not playtested enough.

It's full of logical absurdities (monsters i.e. brainless zombies that pass through doors locked and closing doors behind them), of needless dice rolls, often totally pointless or with minimal effects on the game, and so forth.

A big occasion totally wasted imho. Of course, great flavour + wonderful miniatures + good hype = instant hit.

As for myself, I'll stick to my old Arkham Horror.

The board is très cool! Too bad I kept thinking "I wish I could play Last Night On Earth on this board" most of the game. 

These kind of games are not my cup of tea. My husband and cousin love to play Arkham Horror and also this and I must say this fired Arkham Horror when playing with me. The rules are more clear and playtime shorter. And did I mention the cool board? ;)

Mansions is a interesting game that gets a bad reputation.  The entire game hinges on what type of Keeper you have.  If they play to win, the game will not be fun for anyone else.  If they play to keep everyone in the game and make it enjoyable, then Mansions truly shines.

Here we have a game with tons of bits, a ridiculous setup time, and there is potential for insanity?  Great!  Mansions of Madness is an immersive many-against-one game that is very thematic, but not always fair.

Very good change of direction to Arkham Horror. I really enjoyed the way they've kept consistency with the same characters and expanded their stats. I like the feel - different to AH as time-bound and therefore rattles along at a faster pace (1st game learn rules and play all in under 3 hours. I think experience would get that down to 2 hours) which means it can come out faster, although set up is longer. The only bit I have reservations about is the Keeper thing and I don't know why as I'm an experienced RPGer you'd think I'd find it natural. I need more plays at this because I very much enjoyed it and need to combat my irrational nigglings before deciding whether it's a purchase or not.

Game on the thin line between boardgame and RPG and I really like it. If you have a good keeper who can add a little more atmosphere to it by altering the fluff texts with his own descriptions and describing the place like a Dungeon Master (or Game Master, you choose) it can be a breathless experience and we really enjoyed the game. Even so that we could overlook minor clankiness of some elements and quite unpleasantly long setup time. But believe me - it's worth it. ;-)

The game allows you to become immersed very easily... & it's very enjoyable! Whether you are playing the keeper or the investigators, the game offers a lot of flavor & variety! 

The set up time can be frustrating as well as time consuming (especially if you own ALL of the expansions) but I do think it's worth it when you actually get to start playing.

If you enjoy adventure, mystery &/or a horror theme, this is a must get! It's great!

It's a fun game, though with a lot of "buts."  It's a fun game but the set-up and take-down are very finicky and take a long time.  It's a fun game but the Keeper  sometimes needs to hold back and act more as a GM than as a competitor.  It's a fun game but the rules and components are full of misprints.  It's a fun game but it won't take long to see pretty much everything the base set has to offer.  It's a fun game but the "Print on Demand" expansions are expensive for what little they add.

But, despite these flaws, it's a very fun game.  It's a gorgeous production, the stories are engaging, it has a decent pace to it (though puzzles slow it down), and it occasionally delivers brilliant narrative moments.

The thing about FFG games is that they do not only give you extremely detailed and wonderfully crafted plastic arguments to buy them, but also: there's a lot of game to them. The puzzle-mechanic is a stroke of genius. It gives you a mini-game in the game. Kind of reminds me of the feeling when in a recent videogame you get to play some vintage video games. The whole game is dripping with theme and flavor. It's always thrilling. Admittedly, our hosts had the best ever soundtrack for this game possible (Bass communion - Ghosts on magnetic tape). And that boosted the experience even further. The investigators won the game by one health point. Reportedly, in an earlier session the keeper won by exact the same margin. I already adressed the awesome miniatures, but of course, the whole production quality is amazing. You wouldn't expect anything less from FFG. With games like this one and Sid Meier's Civ (and all the other great stuff), it's hard to not be a fanboy.

I really love games that are chalked full of theme. MoM definitely fills the theme requirement for me. The game mechanics are not perfect, however. I really think the odds are stacked against the players the less of them that there are. I probably won't play this anymore unless there are four investigators. Even pulling punches, one or two investigators have little chance of winning. And as the keeper, I hollow their victory if I play so absurdly bad that they can win. Awesome theme and the mechanics get better the more investigators there are in short.

First Impression:
Good experience, looking forward to play more. I think this game is going to be the bane of most rpg/adventure games for me.

Second Impression:
Not so good as I initially thought, still fair.

The mechanics of this game are a joke, but the storytelling isn't. I can't see this game taking an award in replayability though, and I don't really like the theme.

Update after Second Edition: There is simply no comparison. The need to sacrifice one player's evening so that the rest can have some fun seems terrible now that we know it can be done without.

I was on the fence about this one when I saw the initial hype. I was pleasantly surprised when I finally got a chance to play it. The closest comparison I could give would be that it is like a shorter version of Descent. My only criticism would be that the investigators don't seem to have many 'real' choices to make- most of the 'choices' are really obvious. It then comes down to the dice rolls. True AT goodness.

Great co-op experience for investigators, though a bit hard to learn and characters seem imbalanced. The mystery story aspect does not come through, though.

Never tried it from the keeper perspective.

Yeah no doubt about it this is Betrayal meets Arkham. Sounds like a match made in heaven and it's a blast to play. A bit long though and I like the Betrayal game system better.

It's a really good thematic game, and I suspect that my rating will go up if I can play it again with the same group of now more experienced players. Seems like the replay value isn't huge once you've been through the scenarios, but it definitely has a cool investigation vibe to it.

Thematic Lovecraftian RPBG filled with minis and scenarios. Set-up takes 20 minuets (longer if it is your first time) rules are on the heavy side but great for an indulgent slow game session with a solid group. Decent detail on the miniatures and really good fun to paint.

I wanted to like MoM more than I did. Don't get me wrong: I like it just fine, but I'm a Lovecraft fan that basically loves Arkham Horror.

But many of the scenarios are laking balance (at least in some of the choices) and the set-up of it takes longer than AH. Finally, the game has so many moving parts that no one wants to be the Keeper, therefore I only played MoM as Keeper.

Anyway, I haven't played the POD expansions, so this rating might rise.

RATING: 3.5
Weight: Rulebook tries to be very light but due to compromises and omissions is extremely heavy.

Rules: Extremely poorly written, although marginally better than Arkham Horror. Rules are scattered very illogically around rulebook and distributed in various cards. Rules and especially cards contain many outright errors that require tedious reading and corrections or other fixes. 

Components: Relatively nice (except rubbish figures) but many of the cards are unnecessary clutter, and there could have been much more efficient methods available.

Update: There are way too many cards on the table and sorting takes really, really long while. 

Scenarios have obvious flaws and outright errors (excluding illogicalities). Most scenarios are seriously broken and in many the story does not carry. Game is playable at times and with liberal application of interpretations and their variance from game to game. 

Update: Many house rules have been suggested to fix the most critical bits (to make game and scenarios at least playable), but it would be easier to rewrite the whole instead implementing them all on top of current ruleset. 

FFG has elected not to care.

I'm not really sure what the strong appeal here is. It's like Betrayal with less freedom and more repetition. Few meaningful decisions, and the supposed theme integration was not really relevant. The production values are very good, but that's not nearly enough for a good game.

RATING: 8.5
It's cool, and fun, but the mechanics are kind of brittle. Subject to boatloads of abuse by the Keeper player. Needs to be played like a light RPG, rather than a full adversarial investigators-vs.-keeper game. Keeper is much too powerful, and needs to take an, "is everyone having a good time?" approach. Maybe not use that abusive card until the player's are ready for it, or to better serve the narrative. 
Definitely helps for the Keeper to be familiar with Lovecraft stories, as it permits them to flesh-out the events being described; most are taken directly from HPL's original works.

HeroQuest and the likes meet Lovecraft, a great game. The story-telling aspect and the interspersed riddles are nice. Arkham Horror may be a bit envious now, but do not worry, I will play you again.

The first play started off badly for the investigators, but we managed to infuriate and confuse the keeper by rolling a ridiculous amount of natural ones when it really counted and killing two of his pet Shoggoths without noteworthy casualties. That led to some fatal mistakes on his side.

Really looking forward to the next games.

My group were veterans of Arkham Horror, which we played for the first 1.5 years of our gaming lives almost exclusively before branching off into other board games. As I was the dedicated fan of Lovecraftian things in the group, I decided to pick up Mansions, a decidedly-slightly-less laborious version of Arkham Horror. I also love campy horror, particularly the kind similar to the first Biohazard game. A game based only on exploring a campy horror mansion? Count me in!

In execution, the game recycles much of AH's mechanics in a room based setting rather than a large city. While by no means a bad game, some of the GM's cards are particularly overpowered, and my group quickly figured out that the only way the GM can really lose on at least half of the scenarios is he if makes particularly bad choices or lets the players win. While the stories are the centerpiece rather than the gameplay, it requires a dedicated game master. The figures that make up the majority of the components are also a major pain to store, made much worse by the addition of the expansions.

First few plays under the belt.  Everything feels great and the game mechanisms flow smoothly.

The theme is not linked into the gameplay quite so well.  A couple of scenarios ended without the heroes knowing what happened (not necessarily a problem).  Worse though, I (as the keeper) noticed that the clue cards and event cards did not always make sense as the game progressed - that's a bug that needs fixing.

I have adapted my own scenario sets to prevent these glitches occuring.

I like this game.  It's not Arkham Horror lite though.  This game is more of a race game.  It's the investigators racing the clock against the keeper.  Who is throwing everything he can against them to hold them up.  The game is fun and thematic, but not especially deep.  I'm looking forward to what FFG has coming in the way of expansions.  What you get in the box should keep you busy for some time, but more scenarios would be welcome.

I really wanted to love this one. I love the theme, and exploring a horror location like this is always something I enjoy in a game. I was disappointed in the miniatures. They aren't up to Fantasy Flights usual standard, though some of them do look nice. The game is a little broken, and it really relies on the players being invested in the theme and game to fully enjoy it. Both times we've played the scenarios finished terribly, and the clock runs out too fast for the players to explore much at all.

Its a fun game, has a lot of potential which is actually both a bad and good comment.  It only comes with five scenarios so the replay value is low in my opinion, although there are two print on demand scenarios issued from FF that you can pick up for it.  I personally think I'll be waiting for a big box expansion from them instead.

(After 1 play)

That was an awesome experience. It's has a clear plot arc, great rising tension, amazing components, more meaningful decisions than Arkham Horror, and mini-games!

I wish it were a bit shorter and had more scenarios, but we can't have everything. Ultimately I may skip it because it seems like a big investment for a game that might not have great replayability, but I will keep it on the short list if enough fan expansions come out.

First play, rating may change after subsequent plays. 

The game is very much like Arkaham Horror except better. However, I thought the game to be only average. 

The session we played had us finding clues, except it didn't matter if we found the clues, just that we stopped the DM from doing her secret-task (which we accomplished without knowing that we were accomplishing anything). In the end, all we had to do was walk out the front door to win, because we inadvertently stopped the monster from being summoned. 

Play time, 3 hours. This was longer than it should have been due to a few bits of rule confusion, so I imagine a normal game would take probably 2 hours plus the very long set-up; this makes it a great alternative to Arkaham Horror, same feel of the game within a much shorter time frame.

Very cool narrative-driven gameplay.  I'm not a Cthulhu junkie, and I really didn't care much for [gameid=15987], so I was surprised how much I like this one.  The theme really comes out, and the horrors that are seen during the game are well-written.  You get a sense of the ominous, and a real feeling that the house is bearing down on you.  As a narrative game, there are few better than this.

Another thematic game played at Scott's house, a team of investigator players takes on the "dungeon master" player as they explore a house and try and prevent monstery goodness from bursting forth and killing everyone, taking over the world, etc etc.

I found it decent, it didn't knock my socks off. The setup is long and complicated, and the scripting didn't thrill me. IE, the intro story tells you outright where to start looking, you go there and find another clue which tells you to go to spot B, etc. I find the build the house as you explore system used in Betrayal at House on the Hill much more interesting.

I thought the best part of the game was the puzzle system, very enjoyable, and all of us were happy when we found one our character could work on.

This game have to be played in right way, it's not stone age it's a RPG, investigators must partecipate to the story, it's a full co-op, keeper have to make investigators enjoy and have fear to open doors :)


Luca Iennaco say:

It's all flavour. 
The investigators have scripted paths to follow and several meaningless decisions to take.
Luck is plentiful, but could be accepted in this kind of game. Unfortunately, inconsistencies are plentiful as well.
As an experience, it is mildly entertaining (but there are better options if that's what you are looking for). As a game, it is disappointing.
Very nice bits (miniatures, modular board).

Commented after my first play, I was the Keeper and all of us were newbies. It was fun and interesting, but I played poorly and lost. I thought I'd win, if the time runs out, but it was not the case in our scenario.

Looking forward to play in the future and try the investigator role, too.

Second play as a keeper, some problems with rules, but we worked them out. Bit too tired and drunk to play smoothly, but it was fun anyway. The investigators were too scared to separate and I had plenty of time to achieve my goal.

There are some elements of this game I do enjoy and appreciate. Cthulhu-themed games are a major plus and this game really goes all out in creating a Lovecraftian horror story. Thee battle/ spell casting mechanics where  different outcomes are possible is a nice touch.The production quality of Mansions of Madness is top-notch. The art by Henning is gorgeous and the cardboard components are really thick. The unpainted miniatures are well made  the fact they allow the creature stats to be slotted beneath the miniature is a nice touch.

The reason I cannot score this game any higher is mostly due to my own experience .The gameplay in Mansions of Madness itself favours the Keeper/ dungeon master. Scenarios are created with investigators at a significant disadvantage. Investigators are frequently racing against the clock and against the keeper who has all sorts of ways to delay you. From summoning monsters constantly, forcing you to slowly but surely lose sanity to locking all important doors and forcing you to go through a specific series of events before anything happens.
If you would ever want to pick up this game, make sure that the people you play with are those that value the story-telling element of the game and not winning all the time. And avoid a keeper that reminds you that he 'Helped' a lot by not playing more severe trauma cards or summoning more monsters than what he did so you would "have fun".

My experience with this game is limited to playing the base game but that is enough to turn me off from the Mansions of Madness franchise. When playing with others, make sure that the role of the keeper is that of a story-teller rather than one that is more intent on winning, as this WILL ruin the experience for the other players.In my games the keeper killed my character in EVERY game (and I was blamed for selecting a weak character) and mocking bad dice rolls (and in this game, bad rolls will be frequent when the keeper plays trauma cards on you). In a game where the characters are already facing difficult challenges, a Keeper of this level of competitiveness can ruin the experience for the investigators and leaves a bad aftertaste.

If your group is not highly competitive and enjoy thematic games with VERY high production quality, then by all means get it. Otherwise steer clear.

Designed by Corey Konieczka, Mansions of Madness is a macabre game of horror, insanity, and mystery for two to five players. Each game takes place within a pre-designed story that provides players with a unique map and several combinations of plot threads. These threads affect the monsters that investigators may encounter, the clues they need to find, and which climactic story ending they will ultimately experience. One player takes on the role of the keeper, controlling the monsters and other malicious powers within the story. The other players take on the role of investigators, searching for answers while struggling to survive with their minds intact.

Although based on Arkham world, it doesn’t even come close to its depth and excitement. I think my biggest complains are lack of possibilities, limited resources, and repeatability. I played twice as a Dark player and found it really frustrating reusing my 4 action cards every round. On the end it’s not a game of solving mystery and deducting, rather racing through the rooms containing items. Extensions might change it but I will think hardly before investing in Mansions of Madness products in the future.

NEVER AGAIN

If there was an experienced GM leading this, I might play it again.

Might.

Update: Apparently, the goal of the GM is to create a interesting narrative, not kill off all the players.  So I may give it another chance since Abby was a terrible GM.

I wanted this game to be a bit better than it is.

It takes a bit of a hit for me because of the way the game is setup, from the Keeper's side of things. I feel it quickly becomes obvious to heroes which areas they can completely disregard, and which ones are important.

Also, if you screw up ANYTHING in the setup as the keeper, you can easily ruin the entire game.

Take all the good and all the bad, and you basically have a good game.  It's like pre-scripted D&D where the dungeon master gets to play on the board as well.  I abhor the puzzles (dumb inclusion I need to house variant out somehow).  The minis are cool and the action is fast and relatively simple.  Blah, blah, blah it's all about the theme.  If you want theme, go read a good book.  Hopefully expansions will fix some of the issues I have the the game but overall, it's a good play in the Arkham Horror world of Lovecraft for a few hours.  I do think you need the right crowd of familiars to play this with.  Try before you buy.

I wanted to like this but didn't. It felt very random to me. Part of my problems could have been the result of our overlord, who really just wanted to punish us. But the game just felt mean, and then we lost. Great components, great theme, it just fell flat. I'm willing to give it another shot.

My group really loves this game.  We played Betrayal at House on the Hill and then moved to this game and never looked back.  Some of the scenarios are unbalanced, but I have heard the expansion has fixed a lot of those issues.  Regardless, I have always looked at running this game more like a DM.  As the Gate Keeper, I am not necessarily out to win, but instead to provide a fun experience for my players.  With that perspective in mind, we have never had a bad game.

Very atmospheric, very thematic, very fun.
It certainly blows Betrayal at House on the Hill out of the waters, but it requires one hell (he he) of a long setup and is rather fiddly. 
(And those warping floor tiles are a major pain in the butt.)

Still, I'll gladly play this once in a while, with the right gang.

Mixed feelings about Mansions of madness. This is the first game that we play with an overlord in it (betrayal doesn't count), and while I really like the concept of it, the rest of the gaming party didn't like it -- in face we havent even finished any of its 2 plays. I really wanna give it another shot though, but with a different party this time.

RATING: 7
I [i]really[/i] didn't intend to compare this to Betrayal at House on the Hill, but there's no getting around it.  Both involve haunted house settings where crazy stuff happens and a story unfolds.

The unflattering aspect of the comparison is that, stacked up against Betrayal, Mansions is twice as long and ten times more painful to set up.  In its favor, though, MoM is enough of its own beast that the existence of one shouldn't preclude the existence of the other.

An apt comparison between the two games is that Betrayal is like a Saturday morning cartoon: short, silly, light, and almost completely random.  MoM, by comparison, is an involved, engaging, and purposeful full-length feature.

But the strong thematic similarity is still potentially off-putting, which is unfortunate. Honestly, I think that it's a case of bad timing.  While MoM was under development by Fantasy Flight, they couldn't have figured that Betrayal would come back into print so soon (mistake #1).  Other more problematic issues are the numerous errata sheets (one shipped in the box, another one available for download; mistake #2) and an overly-scripted storyline (mistake #3). It doesn't take a genius to parse the heavy-handed hints and deduce where the next clue should be.

Nitpicks notwithstanding, there is a great deal of innovation that MoM brings to the table: nifty spatial puzzles, a coherent story from the get-go, weapon-specific (and often spectacularly awesome) descriptions of combat effects, plot thickenings, a sense of real danger when the party splits up to explore, and one-off flavor events that provide excellent detail and context (e.g., having a character break a leg). Together, these add up to great escapist entertainment.

Whether the game's fun is sustainable from scenario to scenario is something that I'd like to explore - and hopefully the bubble won't burst in only a month or two.

Well I love Arkham Horror and decided that I would take the shot that it's equally good, though different (and shorter). 

I played it as a Keeper with just 1 investigator.
Which didn't seem to have much of a chance to win. Next I'm going to try it with 5. The rules are pretty well done, I've read through them fluently. It was interesting to see UndeadViking's review to have a better view on how it comes together.

I like the game, but so far I'm not blown away by it. The miniatures seem a bit too big.
I'd rather had extra stories than extra big plastic mini's. But I guess that's preference.
Cards do seem more flimsy than I'm used of FFG.

I really like the combat and spell mechanic and the moves do flow smoothly. So I'll play it more this week, now I got the rules down :).

2nd Play: more investigators does make it harder for the Keeper but I still won before Event 4, Story 1B.
I'll try Story 2 or 3 next time.

Sold the game after 4 games. not bad per se, I just have more fun with other games. If I want to be the overlord I'll bust out Doom and I still prefer Arkham Horror if I want something Cthulhu.

Played this twice as an investigator.  Won once and lost once.

Oh my lord this game sucks.  Cthulhu is such a cool theme, why must all the games be horribad???

This is a game where you stumble around a map.

There is also a light RPG happening at you while you move your plastic thing from space to space.

There is no part of the game which amounts to anything more than stumbling around a map with a light RPG happening at you.  There is a vague notion that you are somehow involved but not so much that you'd know or care what is happening and why.

There were no interesting decisions made in either game by anyone.  Not a single one.  The game mechanics are fxing retarded and unnecessarily random, making them completely strategy proof - literally no way to make an intelligent decision in this game that would benefit you more than any other choice you could make.

Have fun stumbling around a map for 3 hours if that sounds awesomesauce to you.

/game

also the rules are horribly written and full of inaccuracies.

There is no way this game should be rated over 7 by geeks.  What the hell happened to you guys?  Fail a willpower check?

OK, this game (among many others) made me realize that geek ratings are worse/less accurate/more biased than the general ratings.  Some people need their geekhood revoked apparently.

A triumph of style over substance. Mansions of Madness looks great.... and that's about it really. It's fiddly, slow, with a pitiful number of boring scenarios and no scenario generator (you'll have to pay extra for more boring scenarios!). This game could have been a lot of fun, but it isn't and partly because it's fallen foul of Fantasy Flight's inability to not have 357 decks of cards in every game.

Good fantasy exploring board game, where you need to solve puzzles, kill monsters and work together to win the "keeper". There are so much to do on this game, same mechanic as Arkham Horror, a bid easier for me. Only negative thing is the large gameplay, it need more than 3 hours to finish, espessially when you play it for first time! Good game though!

Ok maybe I'll change my rating on this in the future. But for now: I like the theme and the storytelling of the game and I like the gameplay. Sometimes it's hard to keep track of the rules as the dungeon master and the one who had to read the rules. Especially when I didn't play for a while, it's hard to get into it again. But that comes with the style of the game. The other thing is that the set up time is insane. The time to play the game was fine (and I like long games anyway), but the setup drives me crazy. However I'll play it again with my friends. Maybe someone else will take over as a keeper.

To me, MoM is FFG in a nutshell. Beautiful components, wonderful, deep theme, just jaw-droppingly delicious. Takes forever to set up, fiddly as fuck, 16(!) page errata, misprints galore and basically a rushed-through game that could have benefitted immensely from a bit more playtesting. I loooove this game with the right group, but why oh why MoM! Why are you making it so hard for me to love you?!

[i]UPDATE AUG 2012:[/i]
My rating of "9" was preliminary.

Further exploration of the game, especially including the [i]Forbidden Alchemy[/i] expansion, has revealed this game to be a breathtakingly ambitious design - that I for one, love wholeheartedly. Even though I dread setting the bastard up, the game deserves a "10" rating. Hardcore gamers should regard this as a totemic item, worthy of worship.

Twenty years ago, [i]Mansions[/i] would have been regarded as a world-beating masterpiece. I fear nowadays, this design might have been overlooked in some circles - those people are wrong. And not just because I say so.

If you love the Cthulhu dressing, crave a diet-RPG adventure - and aren't intimidated by some fiddly rules and systems, you will adore what is on offer here. Play this on an unhurried evening (maybe once a month) with three other like-minded friends, a full set of painted miniatures, and Ryleh may just rise for you.

[b]In relating the circumstances which have led to my confinement within this refuge for the demented, I am aware that my present position will create a natural doubt of the authenticity of my narrative.[/b]

1. Amazing theme. I have loved Lovecraft's scribblings since I discovered his non-euclidean works at age twelve or so - offbeat, overwrought horror stories packed with mysterious ancient tomes written by mad Arabs, hysterical folk driven insane by terrible revelations and strange beasts, and a pantheon of tentacled gods the likes of which man was not meant to know. Nowadays, more wonderful than the lore of old men and the lore of books is the secret lore of boardgames.
2. A very deep, heavy box of goodness is exchanged for your coin. And it's adorned with a superb painting, I might add.
3. Fantastic miniatures - the sculpts are very detailed and in great, iconic poses. You also get quite a few of the bleeders for your delectation, each with a system of clever figure-base slots. Slide into it a monster chit describing on the underside a powerful figure-specific power, on the front the beast's two ratings (horror and awareness); all this is easy to see for the players without book-keeping or stat-cards. Nice.
*I am almost salivating in anticipation of painting the cultists (in a Resident Evil 4 style, of course) and eldritch monsters.
4. Smooth and elegant rules. With some very minor referencing of the rulebook during play proper, I'd say a competent gamer can run a game without too much loss of insanity.
5. Smart design. Real smart. Professor Pabodie of the Lake Expedition smart. Unique and radical in its capacity to foster an atmosphere of tense, exciting, thrilling exploration and pulp adventure. This deserves to be a huge success and make everyone involved a coffin full of used bucks. Might be one of the most influential games ever designed, only time will tell. I don't like everything that Corey has accomplished, but this is his masterpiece.
6. In the main, the game is simple and fast to run. You may have to read the rules regarding evade and horror checks a few times, but not much else besides. Turns speed past quickly, with little or nothing outstaying its welcome.
7. Hugely fun for the keeper player. I happen to like setting rooms ablaze and turning out the lights while manoeuvring a mewling Shoggoth toward a half-insane investigator (in the game-world!). You know, it was a lot of fun just closing in on the players with mad, dagger-wielding cultists, even before summoning any horrors from beyond. After thinking about it for a bit, I also believe that you have to play the keeper [i]slightly[/i] like a storyteller. Even though you're a team unto yourself, out to win the game, I think if you break into smithereens everything the players find and use, afflict them with every malady at your disposal, break their legs, poke them in the eyes, throw paintings at them with poltergeist activity, you [i]may[/i] find that they don't want to play again. All the fights with monsters are fair game, I would add, just don't beat the investigators black and blue throughout the whole game with interrupt cards. Who doesn't hate it when their character is moved by the enemy? Oh, that would be everyone.
8. Tactical and strategic decisions are available for both teams. You feel like what you do makes a difference, and that every move and action counts, especially towards the end.
9. Seems to scale well for 2-5 players. The jury is still out on the 2-player experience, but the investigator player could play more than one character easily, if that is what you chose to do.
10. Mini-games. Oh the mini-games! These add enormously to the unfolding narrative, providing fun relief, and a pinch of jeopardy to the proceedings: try fixing a fuse and wiring puzzle with a abomination from another dimension shambling toward you!
TIP 1: put a teacloth over unfinished puzzles - so that players don't figure out the puzzle when they're not supposed to.
TIP 2: I beseech you to use the optional 60-second time limit for puzzle solving. It worked in Space Hulk, and boy does it work well here.
11. Well written rulebooks. Mostly. It took me two readings of the rules for me to grasp every pseudopod of the design. However, I would have liked some detailed notes on the scenario set-up pages, regarding the mission-specific rules. For instance, the ladder in [i]The Inner Sanctum[/i] comes in two parts, but the second half is not revealed until later in the game. If I had not puzzled this out before play, I may have panicked slightly during a rushed set-up, flipping backwards and forwards furiously through the booklet looking for a side-note that does not exist. We only played one rule wrong during our first game: the flipping of combat cards and which titles trigger a result. By this I mean, we played that a "sharp-edged weapon" only read out the "sharp-edged weapon" combat card results. You do this, but you must also use the generic "melee weapon" combat card results. I reminder in the rules might have solved this minor issue.
12. Feels like a semi-RPG experience - and that is not something I say lightly, but you do hear it all the bloody time these days and mostly it is not the perfect truth. More so than most any other boardgame I have played, this crafts a fascinating narrative that grips the players and forces them to concentrate on a story. Great stories they are too. Some internet parrots will squawk that you should just crack out the Cthulhu RPG if you demand that kind of game evening. Well, yes, you [i]could[/i] do that. But sometimes I just want to watch a movie, and not wade through an entire TV series, even if it's a brilliant one.
The atmosphere is augmented massively by the copious amounts of flavour text on everything. It's great to read out a small plot before the main game begins, and then a prologue specific to the keeper's story decisions. All this is for naught, and the entirety of the game, if your group does not read out aloud the flavour text on each and every card. Do not buy this game (it is not for you) if you intend to play it by picking up a card and saying "move back 2 spaces", instead of reading the card: "You back away in horror as a pair of blood-red eyes approach you from the gloom..."
13. Brilliant art on the cards. Even if they are recycled from other FFG Cthulhu projects, I don't care.
14. Each room tile is a work of art, drawing you into the Mansions of Madness with resplendent chapels, cobweb strewn attics and tiled halls. They are very well rendered, I must say.
15. Expandable. You will want more of every damn thing. You could expand the combat decks with new descriptions of severing and whatnot, you could add extra charcters to increase choice. New room tiles depicting a clifftop, or a summoning circle in a nearby wood, or a conservatory attached to the mansion, or a sewer system, or a [insert almost any good 1920's horror location], would be welcome. New scenarios using the rooms you already have would be smashing. New monsters, obviously.
16. It's a cooperative team game! All the investigator players try to solve the clues to the unholy mystery together. They win or lose as a team.
17. Tension. Due to the event deck system, and the keeper placing clock tokens on top of the deck, you have a built-in timer mechanism - this obviously fosters tension. As the clock ticks, nasty, bad things happen. Better get a move on, chaps! The ground is shaking, and I hear funny things.
18. Game machinery. The gears and workings of this remind me of Horus Heresy (just a taste) and Fury of Dracula, mixed with a dungeon-crawling game.
19. Pace. We know that the pace of the game is largely dictated by the keeper's actions, but the restrictions on what he/she can do and when (threat tokens and scenario-specific keeper action cards), mean that the game feels a helluva lot less like a crap dungeon game (Descent) and more like a RPG. To be clear, I mean that you're not fighting every turn, at least not at the start of the adventure. There is time to explore, and not be harassed every turn by an axe-licking nutcase - though that may happen! Also, the monsters in Mansions have a bit of weight to them, unlike most of the horde in Descent. It's good to have to regard each monster as a real threat, not as an approaching balloon ready for the investigators to pop.
20. Arkham Horror. One of my biggest gaming disappointments was Arkham Horror. Overwrought, overcomplicated, messy, with amazing fluff gaffer-taped all over it, but that's just my opinion. I'm a Cthulhu junkie, owning all the novels and virtually every Cthulhu RPG book produced, so I was coming at AH with the eyes of a dedicated fan, and it still fell way short of my expectations and desires. Mansions of Madness is superior to that game in every way that matters to me.

1. The figures are unpainted. So you will have to learn fast or pay somebody that does know how to bring these miniatures to life. The immersion in the game will be hugely enhanced by a full set of painted models, I guarantee you.
2. Each game will probably take 150+ minutes.
3. The owner of the game is highly likely to become the keeper of the scenarios, more times than not, due to the very nature and structure of the game.
4. Large amount of set-up and putting away time is required. This is due to the large quantity of parts (cards and tokenry) that keep the game-engine running.
5. Prodigious number of baggies required. Opening and closing these puppies (of Tindalos) will keep somebody busy before and after play. A good solution is a pill box or some-such.
6. A fair bit of dice rolling is necessary. This adds tension in places, and you can increase your odds of success by spending skill points - of which you don't have many. Just letting you know, because some gamers don't like dice (Philistines!).
7. I can see that some players may be put off by the inclusion of mini games. They really shouldn't be afraid of this design choice. They are a radical idea, granted. For me, the mini-games are a crowning achievement. Yes they require different thinking than is usually applied during other boardgames, but I do not feel that they distance you from the rest of the game's undertakings. Some fear that puzzling over a puzzle, alone, without any help from the others might be embarrassing or humiliating. I don't play with boneheads so I don't foresee this as an issue. Actually, scratch that, not everyone is good at abstract quizzing who enjoys a good theme-rich game. I still think they will like this aspect when they have actually tried it.
8. Pricey. Worth every hard-earned coin.
*Not sure why folk whine about the price - in the manner that they feel they should get more in the box. Hey, I realise not everyone has a suitcase full of cash to spend on boardgames in these hardened financial times, but I know people who spend double the cost of Mansions on one night of hard drinkin'. Put it this way, I think you should realise that you're getting the design for the price, not the box of plastic monsters. I don't buy a Blu-ray and say: "In this box I only got the disk". Behind that disc, in the film's production, could have been years of hard toil and craft (say Avatar, Beowulf, or Tron: Legacy). Surely it's the content that ultimately matters here, isn't it? I'd pay the same price as Mansions for just a card game - if it was the world's best card game, mind you. What I am explaining badly is that the "game" is more important to me than the pawns and cubes in the box, but I might be a rare breed.
9. The box insert has failed its SAN roll.
10. It's a cooperative team game! This fact alone will pour on a certain amount of hate.
11. Replayability. I don't see replayability as an issue. Also, if someone else wanted to be the keeper of a scenario straight after I'd just ran it as the keeper, because he can tweak the plot, I'm certain I'd still have a load of fun as an investigator. This has been a key criticism of Mansions since the first news, and it is mostly unjustified, How often do you really play your games? I've looked, and some of you have 300+ games - you can't tell me you've play all of them the 20+ times or so it would take to get bored of them. Same here. I reckon I will be able to play what I have in the original box many, many times on either team before getting weary. And that's not counting on me playing the same set-ups with a different game group. You could play the same scenario with different folks and have a totally separate experience.
12. Cannot be played solo. That would drive you insane, if you dared to attempt it.
13. Pre-game preparation. I strongly advise any potential keepers to prepare a scenario pack, with all your decisions made and all the cards and tokens needed for the quest inside. This way, all you need do is build the adventure from your pre-made pack. I would not attempt to play the game at a convention or game-meet without preparing something like this beforehand.
14. Stress. Playing as the keeper could be stressful (the ever-present fear of cocking up the game by incompetent secret play).
15. Revealed rooms. Sure, you're missing a little of the theatrics you would get if the mansion chambers were revealed one-at-a-time, but what you get instead is a crackerjack story-driven venture. The game would progress at a baby crawl if you had to set up each map-tile as you went along, shotgun or torch in nervous hand.


In summary, does the game achieve its objectives, as stated by Corey in his scribbled notes? A resounding yes! Mansions of Madness is fantastic, and the Cthulhu game I have been awaiting for many years.



I'll leave you with a conversation overheard between a cultist and one of his robed buddies:

"Cthulhu seems like kind of a wuss if he can be trapped by a sinking island or killed by a boat." 

"That’s just because the stars aren’t right. When the stars are right, it don’t matter how many boats hit him. He’ll sink whole continents and lick off the people like salt off a pretzel." 

"Says you." 

"You keep talking smack like that, he’s gonna eat you first."

we had a cthulhu rpg group for ages, so this was a must. allthough i like it, we never played this much. most of our people were unconftable with the rules. i liked the realy sick stories you could tell to the players (depending on cards).
the greatest play (at least for me as GM) was, when my buddy won the scenario (with one survivor out of four remaining), but after years still counts it as a horrible fail for the investigators... gotta luv this suicide-card..

MoM is a very fun game with tons of theme and suspense. I'm really liking the different scenerio choices and how each of the them are replayable. This is truly a dark setting game that acts like a Scooby Doo episdoe on crack. Anyways I'm really enjoying ths game even if all I'll ever get to play as is the keeper. The expansions are looking like an immediate buy too.

I wrote the very first review of Mansions of Madness on BGG:
http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/621934/impressions-after-playing-first-game

However, now that I have had the opportunity to play this more, much of my enthusiasm has waned.  This is a game where the sum is less than the parts.  Lots of neat mechanics - combat cards, choosing options for each scenario, puzzles and locks, etc.  Yet when I put them all together, the game is just fair.  Part of the problem is that the options for each story end up making the final story seem like a series of random events.  Each scenario starts off with an interesting premise, but then you just get stuck doing the same old puzzles and locks, bouncing from one part of the board to another to get keys to open up locks, etc.  While the combat decks look interesting at first, once you look at those that actually apply - say a person with a blunt melee weapon, he just keeps dealing with the same handful of cards so the novelty wears off.  I feel I should love the game, but keep finding it somewhat disappointing.  It would really help if the individual rooms had more flavor text like they did in the old descent or even Arkham encounter cards.

I really wanted to like this game. the components are awesome, miniatures, tiles, chips, everything has a really good quality and introduce you into the mood of Lovecraft world. We enjoyed this game a lot, I complete all the scenarios with different mix of people. However it takes hours to finish and the final rounds feel really repetitive which doesn't contribute  to the storytelling. In addition, the set up is painful. I don't know what we did wrong but the monsters didn't appear at all in all the scenarios, kind of broken mechanics?. Summary, too much time for what it provides.

Absolutely love the art work, and the theme of the game. I don't see balance issues that so many people are talking about. Setup time is a problem, but the game is great.

Sorry fanboys, this is not a good game. Components are great and the theme can be nice. The gameplay on the other hand is super poor. Played all of the scenarios and did not have fun with any of them, despite trying desperately. Neither did anyone in my group.

Betrayal at house on the hill however is an instant hit with anyone who plays it. Gets my vote every time. Mansions of Madness couldn't have been sold any quicker.

First edition. Box is slightly damaged after being transported from Essen... 
This game has soo much potential, but somehow, the charm that caught my attention is drowned in an endless mechanical hunt for clues and puzzle solving. I guess what I wanted was more roleplaying and less fiddliness...

Beautiful to look at and very intuitive ruleset. Fun to play. For me personally, the Lovecraftian horror theme is a little meh, though. Setup takes a while and the Keeper part really needs to be done away from the spying eyes of the investigator players. Given the limited amount of different Keeper action cards, there is a danger that tension will turn into repetition.

RATING: 8
Rating after one preliminary testing. I may houserule creatures (at least the eldritch ones..) to be a little bit stronger.. I've always disliked how supernatural horrors go down like flies with just a little bit lead in many game adaptations of Lovecraftian tales. But real play experience will tell me if I need to. Otherwise this game has that something.

Great game with loads of flavor text and very story driven. It's modeled after H.P. Lovecraft's books set in the fictional city of Arkham in Massachusetts. Two to four investigators pick a story to explore and with clues form the keeper, they're attempting to unlock the mystery and escape/win before time runs out.

This game is very similar to Descent: Journeys in the Dark and another major reason I enjoy it so much.

RATING: 8.5
NOTE: My rating is based on the idea of doing a great deal to "fix" this game.  As published, 2 of the original 5 scenarios are an absolute mess and that alone should make people pause.  However, if you are willing to work to "fix" the game (see numerous threads in the MoM forums,) the game is an excellent experience.

I played this once, but didn't give it enough of a chance really, and should maybe try 2-3 more times to figure out if I really like it enough. Because I really want to start painting the minis but it's not worth buying the game and starting to collect them if I just play Arkham Horror anyway.

Some clever content in this game, but a few strange inconsistancies, and, as seem to be par for the course with FFG these days, mistakes and errata (already!).  However, great theming, and the story element is great.  There are elements of Descent in here, in a positive way, and the puzzles are a really nice touch (if a tad prone to downtime for the others).
I suspect an expansion with clear up a few things as well as add some more maps, as there really aren't many right now (variety in stories within do make that less of an issue, but an issue it is nevertheless)

replayability is a plus, but this game offers so many expansions that it never gets old. Well worth the long setup. Honestly, my only complaint is about the box. Not storage friendly after the monsters are put together.

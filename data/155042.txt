The problems are slow starts, and possibly slow finishes, and perhaps the old 'loss of control' problem with more players. Probably best with three. Efficiencies are rarely achieved, and poor card draws are probably more likely, however I can see why some rate this an 8.

RATING: 4
Steam Donkey strikes me as a curiously old fashioned game in which cards are drawn and then played to complete a 3 x 4 grid.  It is a race to complete that grid, balanced against laying high value cards, which require more cards to be spent to place them. Nothing wrong with this game, but nothing at all compelling about it either. 

The quirky seaside Steampunk theming is quite nice, but I feel as though the artwork could have done more with it.  I found the text font a little difficult to read. Greater contrast in the colours used would have improved functionality.

RATING: 8.5
A great filler, surprisingly good. A lot of game in a small box and although the card draw is crucial, there are a lot of choices to make and things to think about.

Marketed or classified as a steampunk game, this is really anything but that.  The theme is pretty thin on this one.  The game play is reminiscent of Race for the Galaxy in that you are building up a set of cards.  There is a unique mechanism for drawing replacement cards that is kind of cool.  Still, in the end the game is pretty basic and light.  The design works and the game play doesn't overstay its welcome as the game's play time is quite reasonable.  An okay filler, but not if you're looking for theme.

Good card game.  

Theme and mechanics are a lot of fun.

Not sure if 45 minutes is an appropriate game time, not sure if there is any incentive to push for end game.  Seems like digging for bigger point cards is a winning strategy.  

I will need to play more games to see the strategy develop.

A strange simple/deep game where players are developing their own stretch of Brighton's seafront in an alternate steampunk age.  The game plays a little like San Juan, with some concepts flipped on their heads.  Takes a few rounds to "get it" but there is a nice game in there once you have grasped it.  Probably not worth the effort it takes to learn it.  Quirky.

I associate the Ragnar Brothers with strongly themed games, like [A Brief] History of the World and Canal Mania.  This game has a theme, but I couldn't make it fit in any way with the mechanisms, so it was just an abstract game with a pasted-on theme.

The game works, and has real decisions, and I'd cheerfully play it if someone else wanted to try it, but I don't feel any urge to seek out another play for my own benefit.

Kick starter backed and received copies Sep 29.  Artwork not quite as good as shown on KS - but that's always a risk.  

Game lives up to expectation and is very playable as both solo and patience

Another game where great attention needs to be paid to the likely end game, otherwise you end up unable to take a last useful action.  Also, now think some hand drafting may work out fairer.

If you are in the market for a slightly more accessible San Juan then I can wholeheartedly recommend Steam Donkey. It takes around fifteen minutes per player to complete, scales really well and has enough originality to warrant the very reasonable entrance fee.

Enjoyable card game - shades of San Juan.  Theme may grow on me - Steampunk fine, but why the seaside? - and some of the illustrations as icons look a bit similar (and the font on the added cards is hard for my older eyes...) and why oh why red/green?  

Excellently run Kickstarter - all on time and fast postal delivery.

The best thing of this card game is that both sides of cards give necessary information to play. Its mechanics are agile. I think it's very balanced, with the usual randomness in card games. I like very much the theme, its atmosphere and the drawings, but unfortunately some colours are too unclear and the quality of the cards is not very good, otherwise I would have rated it higher.

It's a card-based, tableau-building game, but with enough twists that makes it feel fresh and unique (4 different rows and columns with different meanings, paying for cards with same symbols, personal end of game triggers and bonuses).

Played equally well with two and three players, although I could see having more control over the center set of cards with fewer players.

RATING: 8
Rating based on solo play only. 

Finally beat Douglas 58 points to 54! 

I think it helped that I chose Margate which meant I could close the game faster, needing only 10 Attractions. This seems critical with Douglas because once he has all three Transport cards he's basically pulling off two cards per turn, which can quickly get really out of control!

I also started with Feral Donkey, and made good use of him combined with Princess Royal to get the expensive cards into the resort more easily. 

I managed to get three Special cards into my resort which gave me a +12 bonus at the end. And I tried to make sure there weren't ever any Special cards on the top of the deck for Douglas to nab, because remember, if there isn't a duplicate of the card already in his resort he puts it straight in without having to work for it at all! At one point I even chose to Move visitors a second time in a row instead of Building - even though I would have to go way over my hand limit - just to stop Douglas from taking the Special card I could see sitting there.

And ending the game meant I didn't need to subtract any points for incomplete spaces. 

And even with all those things on my side, I only beat him by a 4 point margin! 

Anyway, short story is this is a rather enjoyable little game played solo. I'm sure it must be great, if not greater played with others too.

Backed on Kickstarter and very happy with the result, aside from some odd variations in background colour on the cards. This is a smashing little game of seaside-resort building, using double-sided cards, but I wish they'd not bothered to 'steampunkify' the art as it adds nothing to the game and looks awkwardly slapped-on, like the original images were re-worked.

I like Ragnar, but not the theme, but got it anyway in support.

Nice little card game, with an interesting card collecting mechanic and some choices to make.  Not too taxing but enough there to keep it fun.  gains momentum as it goes along: soon you have almost too many cards to handle.  Timing is important, and your first built can be critical...make sure it allows you to attract a few passengers!  The them is very silly, but the artwork is nice enough.  Runs a bit longer than you might like but not so very long you long for the end.

RATING: 6
Lightish card game, although a little longer than I like a filler to be. Perhaps a little "thinkier" too, although this really isn't a very deep game. Really I don't see anything exciting here - the mechanic where you attract "visitors" in order to get new cards in your hand seems to be new, but it doesn't seem lead to that much interest in the gameplay either. I still play it, but I'd never ask for it and never find it exciting. My wife clearly sees something in this as she decided to buy it (admittedly it was cheap) after just 1 play - although she is more into quick light games than I have. It's certainly not a bad game at all, I'm just not sure what this has to offer that several other games in our collection don't already.

RATING: 7
11-02-2015. Rated after 1 play. In Steam Donkey you're building a resort, depending on your special ability, of up to 12 buildings. These buildings come in several denominations (entertainment, lodging, transport and monuments) in 3 different colors (yellow, red and green). The game ends when the max is built.

Each turn, you can choose to build as many cards of one color you want. You pay for cards by discarding a number of cards listed on the card of a similar type as the one you are playing. You don't draw cards, so you can take as many cards from the central offer of a single color and store them in your park (each card you've built allows you to store several 'passengers' or cards in your resort.. Another action you can take is take the visitors of your resort to your hand. You want to do this, because you normally do not get cards in your hand.

I think steam donkey is a fun game. It plays quickly and is a little less complicated as for example, Glory to Rome or San Juan but gives me a similar feel. I liked it.

Played once with 3P. A very average card game in terms of gameplay, and a peculiar one considering its theme. Players are managing steampunk amusement parks - which feature mechanical donkeys - in this game which is part race, part hand management. I never felt any particular tension throughout the gameplay, which turned out to be a bit repetitive midway through. This was a bit of a problem given that the game lasted about 40 minutes and was on the long side was a supposed light filler.

RATING: 7
From Spirit games.

Card game where the objective is to be the first to build all your attractions in your seaside resort.

There are 4 types of attractions in 3 different areas to build. You pay for each individual attraction by discarding cards with the same symbol on as the one your laying. Then you can attract customers from the station or deck by matching the colour of their suitcases to the colour of the attraction. Fairly simple stuff...

Few niggles:

1. Icons on the cards can be a little hard to distinguish (transport and buildings)

2. A couple of times have seen players unable to build on first few turns, and the only alternative is to pick up the top discard card.

3. Game probably goes on a tad too long for what it is ( especially in 4 player games)

Despite this ( and with a few tweeks to the rules) this is a good almost charming little experience which shines as a 2 player head to head battle.

An interesting and quick playing card game that reminded me of things like San Jaun / Race For The Galaxy and Glory to Rome with multiple purpose cards contributing to tableau building in front of you. There's a clever way to reserve cards and get them into your hands, and aligning with the individual goals /  bonus scoring and end game triggers

Steam Donkey is wonderfully bonkers thematically, but I suppose that's the point of putting a game on Kickstarter; the odd ones will stand out.

Is it any good though? And the answer is that I'm not sure. It certainly seemed quite interesting and I'd happily play again to try and see where to improve, but the game did seem to come down to a few points here and there, perhaps mostly made up by getting lucky with additional visitors when drawing them from the card deck.

The poor colour choices, along with some lacking rules keep my enthusiasm a little low.

Arrived 2 weeks prior to Essen, the day before my wife, eldest and myself completed the Palace to Palace cycle challenge.  We took it to the hotel for the night before and started a 'learn me' game (time limit, no winner rights to be recorded).  After this we played another game, but remembered to go use the SPA we had booked the hotel for.  SPA was closed, so back to the lounge and more hands of this game - it was a winner then. 
So after the cycle ride my wife and I went to Rome for a break - miles of walking after a 45 mile cycle ride - madness.  But at every opportunity we played a hand, very good for breaking up the foot slog - even played on the plane on return to UK a few times - wife is hooked on the game, wish I got as much attention :) .  

OK - review time - It is a simple game with 3.5 actions. (point five being just take the top card of the discard - very useful at times).  Action 1 - build attraction, action 2 - get visitors to attraction and lastly harvest visitors.  There is a limit to hand size, clue on the back of card to type of attraction and colour areas.  so a tableau of 3by4 can be built (4 attraction types and 3 areas - colour).  An end game condition for each player can be different and a final bonus can be different.  Simple :) - there is also an expansion built in for expert players to add variety.

Upshot - more copies purchased at Essen, thanks guys.  Need to play with my son though as Paul Lister comments poor colour choice at first glance for him to see - never mind, we have marked up other games in the past - I'll update how he gets on....

UPDATE - In good light there is enough difference in colour for my boy to play. :) save marking up.

Steam Donkey is a pretty solid hand-management and set-collection card game. For whatever reason, despite fairly simple mechanics, the game is a bit difficult to explain to new players. It flows pretty quickly once players do pick up the gist of things, though. The strange theme and dull artwork don't do Steam Donkey any favors, and probably push this down a notch for me. In the end, everything here works, but nothing excites.

Exceptional and deceptively simple card game. Simple goal, to create the most attractive seaside resort by building accommodation, monuments, attractions and transport. Innovative 2 sided cards make for some intriguing hand management problems to solve - namely whether to hold onto cards just to make attractions or to build at lower levels and free up your hand. Excellent game, player interaction low-ish but on a par with games like TTR, and far from multi-player solitaire.

Really like this game. Love the theme - the idea of building a seaside resort - so typically English Victorian seaside resort. The steampunk is more added on theme but it works for me to enhance the appeal of the artwork and the 'victorian seaside'. I love the humour - again I would say typically English. The game play is great too - as with San Juan you build cards from your hand but the currency is the cards in your hand. Love the idea of attracting the visitors (back of card waiting at the station) reaping currency if you can bring them on your own train (wealth from trains in Victoian England - adds to the theme) then raking in the money (turn over the visitors and put them in your hand) to spend at your attractions is great. Love the idea of the posters for different victory points for the different resorts, again enhancing the theme.  Works well with 2 now to try it with 4 and with the characters. May move to a 10!

This one&#039;s okay, but I greatly prefer the slightly re-worked re-issue, Hick Hack im Gackelwack, which added nothing but improvements.

Very good, and hardly shows its age. 

Plays up to 8, and is one of my go-to games for larger groups that is not a party game.

On the plus side, it plays up to 8 players. However, it takes longer to explain the game than it takes to play it. Unfortunately, that one play is just not enough fun to ask for another go.

Razzia is so devoid of any skill and meaningful choices, I am reluctant to actually call it a game.

Random sums of money are randomly allocated to a number of venue cards. You are dealt a random hand of cards. 

'Oh that place has a good stash, I'd like to go there. Oh dear, I haven't been dealt that card.'

With no idea what other people have been dealt I struggle see what thought processes can have any influence over successful game play. Place a gambler blind to a venue, oh no its beaten by a Policeman that I had no way of knowing would be there. Place a Policeman, oh no there is no gambler (that I vainly hoped might be there I lose again. Oh goody, I'm there with one other gambler, oh dear they rolled a higher number on a d6 I lose yet again.

In our game, one player got over 10 chips, another got zero. There was no skill, just absolute blind luck. A dreadful waste of time never to be repeated. 

A box of cardboard that really shows its age and demonstrates how far games have come in the last 15 years.

Lots of semi-educated guessing, plus some bluffing.  Similar to the game called Hick Hack in Gackelwack (or more recently, Pick Picnic).  Main differences = this game holds up to 7 players and has greater variety of money (roughly $1k,2k,5k,10k,20k,30k,40k, and $50k).

Finally played this game. Its the kind of game where you have to second guess what the other players might be thinking. These kind of games are always light fun. But the second guessing part just isn't my kind of game.

Nice simultaneous play game from Stefan Dorra that shines with 6+ players.  Players play either a cop or a gambler at different joints.  Cops are trying to catch gamblers, gamblers are trying to win money.  Good fun.

[2 plays] I was hoping I'd like this even better than Pick Picknic (which is essentially the same game, re-themed), but initially, alas, not so much.  I don't like the art here very much, and the money (which looks like band-aids) can be hard to see against the graphically busy background of the gambling joints.  However, the greater range of money does give more flexibility in making deals.  The deal-making rules are slightly different in PP and here; I'll have to play both versions some more.

Very fast fun game, quite light but intense. Play cards to collect cash or negotiate, or get lucky and roll high. A curious group think game with a surprise result by the end.

Not a bad game at all; quite useful if the number of players rises above six.

I find Hick Hack in Gackelwack to be the superior version of this game because the scoring is tighter. The main advantage of Razzia is that it works for 8 players.

This game is an alternative to Diamant for big groups of players and I rate it the same. About 6 players is probably the best number of players. With fewer players the cop cards are of not much use and there rarely will be duels. With more players the game will become to chaotic. You have to enjoy blind bidding and guessing what your competitors will do. If you do this game is a gem from the past.

RATING: 6
An useful game for large gaming (7 or 8 people)

The lesser known Razzia! (not to be confused with Ra-lite). This game is essentially a bluff/bidding game. Players secretly choose a location and if no one else chooses it, they get the money. The fun begins when a two or more players are in contention. Then a deal has to be negotiated or a dice-off happens.

Very simple, very light and a little too long for what it is. I'd consider taking out a few more police cards since they tend to stop negotiations from happening.

Adult version of Pick Picknic. Actually, it was puslished before Pick Picknic. Different theme. A few different rules. Both are very good games, but I prefer Pick Picknic, which is more family friendly.

Quick game involving gambling and cops where one seeks to acquire the most money.  Its a good large group game but really isn't all that exciting to play or very strategic or tactical in nature.  Lots of luck involved as you are limited to what cards you have, and they are drawn from a pile randomly.

I'm missing some of the money chits. Does someone have a list of all chits that should be in the box? The game rules only says how many there are, not what values.

Some games are so light they float.  Razzia is one of them.  Yes, the game is mostly blind luck - especially with six players, but it plays very quickly (around 20 - 30 mins) and turns move at a cracking pace.  A neat take on the Raj/Hols Der Geier theme.

Five locations are on the table, and wads of cash are put on them. Players are dealt five cards consisting of either cops or burglars for each of the locations. In round, players play one card to a location face down, then cards revealed. A burglar by itself gets all the cash, multiple burgulars dice off according to their die roll number if a negotiation of a "fair" split cannot be managed, and if a cop is there with burglars, the cop gets all the cash (if a cop is there by itself, the player gets nothing). Double think game reminiscent of Adel Verplicht, so if you like that one, you might like this one. Light, occasional dice offs could leave sour taste in mouth.

I played this sporadically with 5-7 people. Simple easy bluffing game. Pretty good with 7. Do it work with 8 as well?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A good, light game.  Rules are simple, and simultaneous actions allow for a quick game, even with a large number of players (supports up to 8, which is unusual).  Theme is better than in the remake (Hick Hack im Gackelwack), but restocking and scoring actions in Razzia are needlessly fiddly, due to small, single-sided money chits having a wide range of values.  Hick Hack's simplified scoring using colour cubes is a definite improvement.

An ok Dorra game, but not nearly as good as Hoity Toity. You have almost no info on what the other players will do, so it is really a game of lucky guesses, more of an overly long filler than a psychological gateway game.

Fun for winter evenings, like playing poker, but shorter. A nice guessing game that can be very quick, easy to explain and playable with many people. Maybe a little bit TOO short, some more money in it would have made an even better game. Under-rated, as most of the older games, now remade as hick-hack and getting a better score.

Why is the rating on this game so low? I admit: I was nervous when I saw the die in the box... but it doesn't come into play unless negotiations fall apart, so there's always the opportunity to avoid the roll. I liked it a lot more than I thought I would. It's fun.

This is almost identical to Hick Hack, so I rate it the same. The theme is a bit more adult, and the graphics are really outdated. I prefer the presentation of Hick Hack.

A new family favourite and better theme and slightly different mechanics to Pick Picnic. However use the Picnic rule that a cop doesn't take the money, he arrests any gamblers whose value is multiplied by 10000. This enables you to use the better tactical variant of cop to beat the other players, and then next go scoop the money. Great fun!

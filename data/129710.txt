RATING: 7
There is luck involved in the card draw, but this is mitigated nicely by the interesting drafting mechanism. You may end up taking face-down cards from your neighbour, if you so wish, but you are able to attempt to "read" their motives, so it is does not feel like a random outcome. Overwhelmingly the game rewards strong tactical play. A neat, short, puzzley card game with great artwork and a pleasant theme.

RATING: 7
Something about the logic puzzle of it really appeals though alongside a deep guess in to what others think you will do when splitting the cards. Some games have players run away and that's the price to pay for an interesting mechanic and scoring system.

Nice little puzzle game with city building theme. More important is the city development and evolution make sense, esp for those who had played Simcity.

A puzzle with not quite enough to think about.  A drafting game that can screw you over.

The challenge is to assemble tiles in a grid in the most efficient way possible.  I am rather fond of the I cut you choose mechanism, but here it seems to slow the game to a plod.  In addition, there is a blind element to that selection process, which sometimes means that you gamble...and get something totally useless.  

Production quality is decent and the artwork is quite pleasing.

Of the three city building games from Alban Viard, this one is the best one to introduce the core idea that permeates all three. It's simple to setup and explain, but tricky to get right. Players quickly admit that the mistakes are their own, but it can be tricky to see how to play well during the first game, given the importance of the first cards you lay down.

Tight, smart game that will be enjoyed by those that stick with it passed the first few games!

RATING: 4
I played this game because of its adjacency mechanics: a concept I've been steadily exploring ever since I started playing Glen More. Of the games on offer at Spiel 2012, this was the simplest, so I wasn't expecting a great deal.

Regrettably the game did not dispell that expectation. I liked the idea of having a bit of an uncertain I divide-you choose mechanism, but on the other hand the other player(s), not knowing what is in the closed cards, can be pretty much f*cked that way. My partner suffered on more than one occasion from a bad gamble, and for such a simple game things can turn pretty bleak. That's pretty harsh. In addition, the adjacency mechanics in the game are, although very understandable from the subject's point of view, quite limited in their scope. You'll want to strive for lots of resident areas, but the placement rules are so restrictive that it can be genuinely hard to grow the city that way. Again, my poor partner was locked out of five or six upgrades because of conflicts with those rules. Now, of course, these things are expected on a first game, but that doesn't quite make the threat of bad buildings and their forced placement go away. You [i]will[/i] end up with dead or hard-to-develop areas, and that's somewhat at odds with the game's apparently simple nature. Finally, there isn't much variation in how the buildings interact. It keeps Card City nice and simple of course, but I think that the game would have scored a lot better for us if more relaxed options were available.

Not a bad game persé, but unfortunately one which rubbed us slightly in the wrong way. Both my partner and I much preferred the similar but much more open and fluid OddVille—even though that too has its own share of problems.

We played the "Pay five per L card" rule wrong, we allowed ppl to build for less if they had less money, that's what the rules suggest ("Pay five money if you can").

RATING: 5
If you know Town Center there is a lot that will feel familiar in Card City. The rules are almost identical with two major differences in game play.

The playing area is only two-dimensional. The game is much more intuitive and much lighter as a result, but obviously there is also less room for clever play. This effect is further compounded by the second big change. The draft is now half blind, ie. the starting player gets to see all the cards but only offers one set to the second players who can then either choose to accept it or gamble for the contents of the yet unknown remaining cards. You are far more likely to end up with cards you have absolutely no use for in this game.

The changes to the draft seem like a good idea to me. They add some much needed uncertainty that should keep the game interesting. The switch from 3D to 2D, however, takes away a lot of the appeal of Town Center. Building options are now obvious and rather boring.

The draw deck is crafted depending on the number of players to last exactly 10 rounds. Each round, the 1st player draws twice as many cards as there are players. Cards are drafted with the "I divide, you choose" mechanic. The player chooses two of the cards to turn face up. The next player can take those cards or leave them and take the remaining face down cards. That player chooses two and so on until all cards are claimed. Players add the cards to their 5x5 tableau according to fairly strict placement rules. Commercial "districts" (groups of connected cards) produce money that you need to buy Leisure buildings which are required to grow your Residential districts which score you points. Industrial cards increase your card limit and Parking cards are used to take up space or separate districts that cannot exist next to each other. That's the game right there! 

The last couple of turns can get a little funky as you may have already completed your tableau or not end up with cards that are useful to place. The game is fine, but I'm eager to try [thing=124545][/thing], which I have yet to play with actual opponents. Maybe next month!

The first time playing this was back to back with Town Center, its predecessor in the Small City trilogy. Basically, Card city is the 2D less thinky card version of Town Center with a more fun distribution mechanism, more randomness and higher accessability. For now, it's a matter of taste and situation which game to choose. Not sure, if there will be differences in replayability between those two.

Card City is essentially Town Center de-evolved into two dimensions to make it clearer and less fiddly. For solo play at least the problem is still that there's clearly an optimal way to play and it's just a matter of getting the right draw sequence. The dividing and choosing part will make or break the multiplayer game.

This is another brain burning puzzle of a game also involving the cut the pie and you choose mechanism for selecting cards to be built in your city.  Five different types of cards are present and there are zoning restrictions that do not allow certain cards to be built next to others.  City must be built in a 5x5 grid.  Two types of cards can only be expanded via development.  The head is hurting by the end of this game!  Unused spaces in the grid result in a negative point for each space.

[u]02-Jul-2015[/u]:  I can't help but compare this to Town Center as I've played that one by the same designer several times in the past.  This is basically the exact same game, but in card form and in two-dimensions rather than three.

I have not played multiplayer yet, but I think the game's I-split-you-choose mechanism would work quite well in this game.

For the solo game, this very much has a puzzle quality to it, just like Town Center.  You begin with City Hall in your 5x5 tableau and will add further buildings from your draw deck.  There are various placement rules which must be followed and scoring VP is your ultimate goal.  This is accomplished two ways - gaining money and creating a large Residential area.

The artwork is very cute, playful, and enjoyable to look at.  The cards are very good quality, but the additional money chips are just simple, plastic circles.  This is a nice, puzzly solo game.  And while it does feel like there is a "solution" to the game, the random card draw should help keep it interesting for some time.  However, the multiplayer game is probably where the extended gameplay will come from.

This is a coloured card placement abstract game where certain cards cannot be placed next to others and get bonuses when placed next to other cards. The city theme is completely pasted on and you could play the game with a set of coloured cards.

Doesn't bring anything new to the table at all. It's a city building game with an I split, you choose mechanism. Some of the cards are hidden to everyone but the first player, but otherwise this is a very pedestrian game. There are only a few different types of buildings, so nothing exciting there. Then the scoring at the end reminds me a lot of Town Center, which I felt was really dry and boring for a game of its type. In both games, it's like the designer thought this would be a fun idea, and tacked on a scoring method to tie it together.

UPDATE: Holy crap, this IS the same designer as Town Center! Avoiding this person's games from now on...

I played a short 3-player test game at Essen "Spiel 12" fair, explained and guided by the designer himself.
I had the impression that rules make sense, are well thought through, and the game works well with them. There is a good drafting mechanism that ensures the game is not very luck dependent. The designer said that he had the video game [thing=75934]SimCity[/thing] in his mind when he created this game.
I like that it can be played solo, too.

The game is similar to Town Center, but in just 2 dimensions and with an added bluffing (sort of) element: instead of stacking cubes in groups of 2, the start player draws 2n cards and makes 2 lots: 2 face-up cards, versus the rest of the cards half face-up and half face-down. The next player then chooses a lot; whoever gets the mixed cards repeats the process, and keep repeating till each player has 2 cards. 

Despite the fiddliness, I think I prefer Town Center (especially in the Lego version). Both games are interesting puzzles, but at the moment I think I'll not likely play this one again except as a solo game (available at Boiteajeux.net). The solo game online takes about 2 minutes?

Almost exactly the same game as Town Center but in 2-D instead of 3-D. Lacks the additional challenges of Town Center's multiple maps, but makes up for it by being significantly more portable and a bit easier to teach.

Recommend it as a portable, solo-able "beat your score" style game and as training wheels for it's bigger brother. I think it's safe to say that if you like Card City, you'll like Town Center even more, but if you don't like it, you'll probably not like Town Center even more, as well.

RATING: 7.5
Gentle almost to the point of nothingness with 2 players, this game comes alive with three players where you have some control over the cards as you're drawing six instead of four. It really needs to be played a couple of times to really grasp the building/expansion rules and how to benefit from them.

Update: The more I play this, the more fun I'm having with it! It doesn't always go to plan and oftentimes you're simply having to make do with the hand you've been dealt but that's a wonderful challenge in itself.

Further update: Town Cent(re) has pretty much replaced this for me, with Card City mostly now functioning as a way of teaching Town Cent(re). That said, it's still a nice game though I'm a little concerned that it's possible to lose (ie have nothing left to do) if you keep getting residential cards. The limited number of Leisures is also a little frustrating at times as strategies based on them are pretty boom or bust.

Rating up from 7.3 to 8.5 and then down to 7.5.

First half of the game is somehow interesting, but end game brings only frustration and feels somehow broken.

This is more a multiplayer puzzle than it is a game.  I like that it's thinky, but once you figure out the way to organize your playspace to maximize your points and profits, it's just a matter of hoping the right cards come out in your favor to make it happen.  For it to be an Alban Viard game, I was expecting more, but it was pretty disappointing.

Nice filler, with a puzzle element (where is the best position to put the new card). I have played it only solo and despite the fact that it is "aim for the high score" I kind of liked it. I think that with more players gets much better as you hide one card and your opponent has to choose without knowing what exactly he is getting. Certainly deserves a try!

Great game. Love the "I split you choose" mechanic. Also the way the city grows makes for some interesting choices

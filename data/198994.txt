We've played it several times now and my feeling is that it swings a little bit more wildly than Star Realms. Less close games and more blowouts (especially using the individual class character decks). Love the art work and also the use of Champions which feels more natural than bases and outposts but the text (especially on Champion cards) is often too small. Class cards should have been more differentiated in styling. I'm hoping expansions improve the game and maybe expand the character classes as well and offer more ability choices to build with.

An adequate res-skin of Star Realms, but lack luster and repetitive game play with generic fantasy theme has this one missing the mark for me.

For 1v1, I recommend Star Realms over this.

But for higher player count, this game can work really well with character packs. Just... don't play character packs for 1v1.

Really fun game.  I really don't know if I like it more or less than Star Realms.  They are both great, and both different.  But I've played 2p games for hours and hours.  You absolutely need the character decks!

One part, is that Hero Realms Champions/Guards (like Bases/Outposts) are much harder to kill if you get one out very quickly and can change the game permanently (loss).  With Star Realms I thought it was harder to keep bases out each turn.  And in all cases you can clear them off 75-90% of the time, but early on it's more like 50-60% which changes the game drastically.  Not good or bad, just different.

Ranger is OP.  Must be balanced better and some cards are unbalanced.  In Star Realms I thought almost none of the cards were OP, where in Hero Realms there are some cards we have removed because they are stupid (worse than a Fire Gem) or just plainly so over-powered they are not balanced.  Ranger is one deck, super fun to play, but very OP.

Was very fun for a simple deckbuilder.  At this price point, it is a great way to introduce deckbuilding.

RATING: 8
An improvement on Star Realms which I did enjoy too. I like the fantasy theme better but the game works more streamlined even as a base game. Example, the 'stun' mechanic dealing with a turtle strategy and keeps the game moving and exciting. 

Also, the game works for 4 players even with one base set and works for gameplay too, which I can't say I am keen with star realms. And the life tracker on this although still not great but an improvement on star realms.

The downside is I feel it does not add much to the genre but is quick and fun so it does what it does well.   

Overall, I recommend it and want to play it more.

While many people say this is better than Star Realms, I would say they are equally good. I like the simpleness and space theme of Star Realms, but the complexity and graphic of Hero Realms.

RATING: 9
Wow!  This is an excellent deck builder!  Compared to its predecessors (other deck builder games) - this one takes the best parts, cleans up a lot of fiddliness, and makes it a fun, smash-your-opponent quasi-negotiation game.  I *really* like this!

One concern - is the card-thinning of the red faction too strong?  But then there's the negotiation element in free-for-all (FFA) mode and that actually does balance it a bit.

I can't wait to see the coop expansions!

Rating may go up with additional plays.

This one rocks!

RATING: 5
This review contains all the Hero Packs as well.

Hero Realms (HR) plays almost identically to its predacessor, Star Realms (SR)and Star Realms Colony Wars (CW). There are some minor tweaks that cause the experience itself to be vastly different, as much so as is possible while using the same ruleset.

Rebalanced starters - The vanilla starter decks are rebalanced to give a single +2 buy and +2 damage card, causing the game to be a lot less boring. This has a two-edged effect of making the middle of the game less of a slog if you don't get to thin your deck but also making the first player have even more of an insane advantage than in SR.

Deck thinning - The total number of thin cards (one of the most major goals/mechanics from SR) is down to 9 cards total from 15! This is clearly deliberate. Unfortunately, it's a terrible decision as it lengthens every game unbearably, causes the game to be sacky and favor whomever gets a thin card first, and makes grabbing them up a no-brainer. Unlike in SR, where they were frequent enough that both players got the opportunity most games, midgame buys had some positives and negatives (instead of always positive) and caused the game to take a reasonable amount of time, while facilitating interesting strategies. In HR, thinning is always what you buy every time. It dominates the trade row. And they stupidly still stuck one color with thinning.

All the extra draw - Great addition to the game! One of the few things I can say was sorely lacking in SR. Unfortunately, it appears to be compensating for the lack of thinning/scrapping from original SR. This doesn't mitigate the problem AT ALL. The reason is that you have to actually get to the draw card in order to speed through the deck slightly, but the thin card affects your deck forever in the future...and then again every new round...which comes compoundingly faster. The math dosn't lie: draws suck compared to thins. Thins still exist. Therefore thins are even more king than they used to be.

Discarding is useless now - Despite the rebalanced starter decks, discarding is practically useless now. You might occasionally hurt the opponent or block a key buy, but most of the time it has exactly zero effect on the game. After dozens of discard attempts, only once did it hurt a player and it was after they had gotten super lucky and thinned. That's because discard was used in SR as the natural counter to scrapping. As you scrap, the quality of your hand goes up, so discard becomes more necessary than say, at the start where they just pitch a Scout (or in this case a Gold).

The price is atrocious - Don't even think of paying full retail $20 for this. Star Realms retail is between half and a fourth lower than HR and is a much tighter game by itself. Even if you get the $13 discounted price at some online stores, you're about in the same area as SR (go for it then, if you like deckbuilders! Great value at that price). However, the Hero Packs open a whole new can of worms...

Hero packs are EXPENSIVE - And wasteful. There are about 7-9 reprints in every hero pack that you already have FOUR FULL PLAYER SETS of. The game already comes totally loaded down with golds, life trackers, and other starter related cards. Then there's the "hero" card which is just blank artwork with a single life number slapped on top. Having redundant starters and life counters probably seemed cool to Rob/Darwin but it just cheapens the whole product and makes it transparent that they really aren't worth the retail value of $5 a pop. That's just a complete ripoff. Even the $3.50 discounted price is pushing it.

Individually sold - This gets to the heart of the expense. WWG has been repeatedly called out for needlessly splitting cards people ONLY want as sets up in other games (Star Realms United, Epic Tyrants, Epic Uprising) and even had people quit their Epic game after they were warned the first time around just for this business model alone. When you split up a package (add garbage filler) and sell what everyone would want together as separate, you incur additional packing and shipping weight costs to every single set, plus the waste costs. That cost gets passed on to customers who pay a premium. If they trimmed the garbage and sold all 5 heroes as one pack, people would be much happier and it would be less confusing for people just getting into the game. For now, it seems like an underhanded way to eke out a little more money and hype.

Unbalanced - Normally, I don't care if a game is balanced on a knife-edge or something. I'm only going to point out egregious violations of balance. As it stands, these heroes feel like rushed last-minute stretch goals from Kickstarter (another problem this game has). They very well might be. There's certainly absolutely no balance between several of the heroes both in life and ability. The Wizard for example is objectively weaker than almost every hero, and takes an auto-loss to at least the Fighter since turn 1, Fighters can have 60 life versus a Wizard's now-40 life. Disgusting. This would be perfectly fine if they were meant solely for co-op play against bosses, but bosses weren't released when the core+heroes were released, so I'm judging them by their implicit competitive nature.

Overall, the idea of Hero Realms being a good bargain deck builder, balanced, taking appropriate time, or being competitive is absolutely laughable. Still, it's good for a few games, especially if you're new to the "Realms" style of play and don't have an extremely deep technical understanding of everything happening. If you are in fact new, I highly suggest going after Colony Wars to teach yourself, then play some Hero Realms for fun, then switch to Star Realms and never look back. As deckbuilders go, everything outside of WWG is probably worse than everything they make, including HR for as much grief as I just gave it.

The good: Fresh experience to the "Realms" style of play. A few of the tweak decisions weren't bad. Heroes feel thematic to play. Art and card frames are amazing A+. New linen finish on what feels like blue or black core card stock. Core game by itself with online prices is a good bargain.

The bad: Literally the rest of this entire essay-long review.

RATING: 7
It's Star Realms but with more polish!

Star Realms was a great quick n' dirty deck building game that really distilled the genre down to it's most fundamental elements. It was really fun at first, but felt shallow over time. Expansions added more depth, but I had already parted with my copy by then.

Hero Realms is like Star Realms but it includes those interesting expansions right from the start. It also includes cards for up to four players in one box.

At the end of the day, if you already own Star Realms, this doesn't do enough to be worth owning both. If you want a quick little deck builder though, I would recommend Hero Realms over Star Realms.

RATING: 8.5
This is a killer new interpretation of the Star Realms deck building system, with much improved artwork and a fitting fantasy theme. Love the character packs, too, where you can choose an iconic character class and personalize the game that much more. My ONLY gripe is that there is no coop available out of the box itself, nor in the character packs I've gotten so far. They'll be adding some online coop missions and I assume printing some boss cards for it, but it would have been great to crack it open and run some solo games immediately. As it stands, I can only run the one promo card boss (without even having the promo card).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

At first glance it is Star Realms with a fantasy theme. But after a few plays it feels more like Star Realms 2.0. The character starter decks are nice and the way the champions activate creates some extra tension.

I am rating the basic game.  The expansions make this a much better game in my opinion so look into them if you play this.  

 Plays like Star Realms but with lessons learned from the Cthulhu Realms.  In general it's no a whole lot different than the previous games out of the basic box.  

However the expansion decks and such change the game a lot more than the expansions for previous games. (Class starter decks that change the initial 10 cards, Boss decks that are meant to play vs 4 players.  Campaign decks that play more like a persistent adventure.)

Really similar to Star Realms with some improvements, like richer habilities, a bit more of depth, and that can handle more players with the core game.

RATING: 7.7
Star Realms is one of my favorite deck builders - on reading the cards in detail and 1 team play this is a great re-implimentation but I think it focusses on the "wow" everything overpowered factor over balance so whilst you wont probably get many long drawn out slogs individual games could feel quite imbalanced...yet given the power of the cards in one side doesnt win quick there is always a good chance of fighting back.  Art is great, box is great....For frequent play I might be more drawn to Star Realms for a competitive game but for casual play this is a lot of fun.  Also cannot read too much from one swingy play.

A 2 player deck-building game with a fantasy theme. It's not bad, but I'm not sure it introduces enough that is new and interesting to keep me excited about it.

Despite being a fantasy guy, this fell quite flat with us. The games were fine, but uninteresting. The art is good, but very human centric for a fantasy game.

A fun re-skin of Star Realms, with a few changes.

Kickstarted.

Hero Realms takes the already solid mechanic of Star Realms and mashes it seamlessly with the likes of its inspiration: Magic the Gathering. While feeling very familiar to Star Realms and Magic veterans alike, the gameplay is fast with little down time between turns. The addition of character packs (Kickstarter add-ons, however purchasable through the publisher) adds another layer of depth to an already solid and exciting game. The ability to play with more than 2 organically rather than tacked on by purchasing another deck further expands its appeal, especially when teaching to new players. With the campaign decks slated for delivery to KS backers later this year, Hero Realms has rapidly outpaced Star Realms as the head-to-head deck builder we reach for. That said, it's slightly larger (physically) than its space-based older sibling, which is why it doesn't fully supersede Star Realms. But with greater depth, more content on the way, and the option to organically play with 2 or more, Hero Realms is a worthy successor and easily one of the top deck builders on our shelf.

Ok, I actually won this through a BGG contest for their Kickstarter.  I'm posting it so I wont forget and so I make sure the publisher doesn't forget.
I received the Kickstarter game and all of the reach goals. Additional expansions to come in 2017 which I've also won.

-1 because I think blue colour is underpowered

Change form 9 to 8:
Without the hero packs the game itself getting a bit repetitive. We all rate the cards the similar way in our group already and it doesn't give enough variety after some time. Still would love to play with hero packs or new people.

Demoed at Origins. Played with Rob of White Wizard. I enjoyed the ramped up starter cards, really helped get the game going quickly. The combos worked well together and I like the way the champions tap to use abilities. Overall if you like Star Realms, this is gonna be a home run for you. I am really looking forward to getting my hands on the other content. (Champion decks, boss decks, and campaigns)

A quite streamlined deckbuilder with some pretty cool artwork but also a blatant lack of depth. During your turn, you basically vomit your hand at no cost, purchase the best cards you can afford, assign combat damage to your opponent's champions and/or face and draw a new hand of cards. Rinse and repeat until someone eventually dies. It's fairly entertaining, but it would just be a much better game if there were more skill-demanding decisions to be made.

RATING: 8.5
Until I played Hero Realms, Ascension was my favourite fantasy-themed deck-building game.  It's possibly not anymore.  I really enjoy Hero Realms.

There are 4 different factions in Hero Realms: Guild (Blue), Necros (Red), Imperial (Yellow) and Wild (Green).   The abilities on the cards and the combos between the Faction cards are themed to each Faction.  

I like the artwork.  And I love that White Wizard Games have created competitive, cooperative and solo ways to play.

The character packs are great and make the game feel more thematic.

The game comes in a small box so is easily portable (but unfortunately it doesn't fit the character packs in as well).

Almost an essential deckbuilder. Takes the age-old Dominion/Ascension deckbuilding/market row mechanics and uses uses it basically as the draft method for a game of Magic-lite.

This is a fun head to head deck building game. I'm not too sure how well it would play with more than 2 players but at 2 players, it played well. Played in 40 min and was easy to learn although it got a little crazy at the end with all the combos from cards playing off of each other.

On its own is not that different to star realms... feels and plays mostly the same however there appear to be a lot more powerful cards in hero realms which this may be a bad thing as getting some good coinage and appropriate cards in the market at the right time can have a massive impact on a early game.

Also it is more difficult than necessary to add up the coinage as the icons are different sizes and in different locations so you can't cascade cards.

Can't wait to get this. Looks like a marriage of Epic and Star Realms (both I like). Hero Realms is much more than Star Realms "re-skinned" as the new mechanics, characters and quests suggest. Based on what I see so far I'm giving it a 9 and I will re-access this once I get my KS Adventure pledge.

RATING: 9
Astounded to find this gem so pleasing...a fast paced deck builder (first one i ever played) that has enough depth to satisfy my gaming group but still fast and short enough so you can play it tournament style. A 15 min playtime is just about right for a game of this type...and its sooo portable ! I read a lot of negative comments concerning HR, and im glad to say that i cant see them as problems in our plays. You DO have to think, the game is NOT automated, and NOT simplistic....it will however be different every time you play, and you can get screwed by the trade row (but who cares, you will more than likely play up to a dozen games in a sitting and those situations are rare indeed). Plus strategies are slightly more important than tactics (which in my book is totally fine). Take this game for what it is, and you will have a blast each and every time you put it on the table, and let me tell you its gonna be often :D ! It kinda reminds me of Hearthstone, but better....

As a 200+ game veteran of Star Realms: Hero Realms has the same mechanics as Star Realms, and presumably the same biggest flaw, which is that there is unavoidable (unless you buy nothing) luck of the draw with the trade deck.

That said, I had lots of fun playing it. There seemed to be new stuff happening such as tapping cards, and the possibility for custom starting decks and campaigns. All in all, it looks great, it's fun to play, and I look forward to playing it again.

Hero Realms is essentially the same game as Star Realms, so if theme matters, pick one on those merits. There are small considerations for both. Hero Realms has more appealing artwork and some interesting start player deck variety (with the character expansions), but is in a slightly less portable box. The shameless use of the Magic tap symbol cracks me up.

In the end, both are fantastic portable games. I can't see the need to own both, but I of course now want the newer one I don't own.

Plays exactly like Star Realms, though the cards seem stronger, thus allowing swingier games. My only complaint is the champions (this game's version of Star Realms's bases) are in portrait mode like all the other cards, making it easier to accidentally discard them at the end of the turn. 

I highly recommend the character packs for more variety.

Gave this to Claire for Christmas.  We enjoy Star Realms, and this theme is a better fit for her.  It's like the original game, but just different enough to force you to think differently.

First of all, if you're not planning on paying extra for the character packs, don't bother with this game and get Star Realms instead.  That being said, this game with the character packs is fantastic.

The different colours and actions just don't feel distinct or clear yet, compared with Star Realms. In Star Realms each colour felt like it had a clear purpose, and it was much clearer what was going on. The tapping mechanism is good except that it means the champions blend in with the actions. Maybe better would have been to have the champions be sideways like Star Realms bases and when you tap them they go vertically? The scoring mechanism is MUCH better than SR, but of course that's coming in Frontiers. The classes are cool, but again, finding it difficult getting a real feel for what's going on. We'll try it some more. Down from 8 to 7. (SR is a definite 9 or 10)

So far, it feels like a slightly "upgraded" version of Star Realms in the way that the cards feel a bit more powerful.  But there's no material change in game play.

With the Character Packs I'm bumping Hero Realms up to a 9. I like the fantasy theme and artwork better than Star Realms, and Star Realms is great.

Hero Realms is decent deck builder. It offers some unique elements in that the competition is combatting opponents to whittle down their health. Strategy is light. Collect like card types for synergy bonuses. Healing feels too powerful and can turn into a stale mate until someone happened to not draw a healing character. It is good enough for it length, but deck building is its primary component. And just deck building can feel redundant.

This game is awesome!  It is a fun 2 player game that is a lot of fun.  It is based on the Star Realms battle/build system.  There are a few things I prefer about Star Realms;  the are kind of all looks the same, and champions and actions don't look that different than each other either.  But that being said, it is every bit as good as its predecessor.  It is also a great substitution for anyone that doesn't like the space theme of Star Realms.

RATING: 7
A nice thematic alternative to Star Realms. It has what I like about its sci-fi sibling but adds alternate starting cards for specific character classes to add more variety to the game opening. Recommended for players who don't already own Star Realms and prefer a fantasy theme but players who own the sci-fi version will probably not see much difference.

Great game. So easy to teach and get into, a huge sucess in my group. Although I prefer to play with 2, team games are also fun. 
The character expansions make it so much better, it's amazing what a couple of extra cards can do for theme a variety. I think a couple of characters needed to be in the base game. Can't wait for the co op expansion. CAN'T WAIT

RATING: 9
Basically this is Star Realms rethemed.  There are no noticeable differences.  My wife prefers this theme, I prefer space.  However, I will say that this game has a lot of what seem like overpowered cards.  Not crazy unusual to do 30 points of damage in a turn.  The result is that the games are perhaps shorter and have a bit more randomness.  In my opinion slightly less desirable than Star Realms.  Also Champions (hero realms) are less visually obvious than Constructs (star realms) are.

Doesn't do much different then any other deck builder, but that doesn't mean it isn't good. Prefer it to Star Realms, maybe it's the theme. The character packs really elevate the game.

RATING: 6.5
So the base game, like Star Realms, is a pretty basic 7 from me, more like a 6.5 even. As a 2-player game, I don't really care for it that much; games go by too fast, and there isn't enough back-and-forth to make it that fun for me. However, multiplayer Realms is really fun, and where Hero Realms really shines is with the Character Packs! These add a really cool level to the game that makes it much more playable to me. The Items add another nice touch.

So, base game = 6.5, but WITH the Characters packs, it's an 8.5 (which is what I've rated the individual CP's).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I'll be the first to say this makes no sense.  I love Star Realms:Colony Wars.  Love love. So Hero Realms with same play but variable starting characters and future campaign seemed like a must buy.  

And it sort of fizzled for us.  It seems slower-moving but like its over before I got a chance to build my deck; again I realize that makes no sense.

We'll play it a few more times to see if it grows on us but so far the magic of Star Realms did not carry over to Hero Realms for us.

"Hero Realms" is more than "Star Realms" with a fantasy theme pasted on. The in game choices are more, better, and higly rewarding. The overall pace & feel are different as well - more refined and fine tuned.

Add the different character decks, and the newly released expansion, and you have a very good deck-building game, that builds upon the core SR system, but takes it to a different level (in the good sense). Get it!

Playing without the character packs or other additions from the Kickstarter. A very solid deckbuilding game. Dealing damage as the win condition seems much more organic and smooth than having to total up point values at the end of Ascension. I have yet to win, but I like it enough that I don't mind.

I'm told it's pretty much identical to Star Realms. I don't mind the similarities because I dislike generic sci-fi enough that it prevented me from playing Star Realms. Generic fantasy I can just ignore.

Compared to it's predecessor Star Realms this feels much better.

The base game is lacking in some respects as it's pretty much the same as Star Realms, it's the character packs that make this game feel different. Each character has their own starting deck as well as their own HP values and special powers.

Without the character packs I wouldn't bother picking up this game if you already own Star Realms.

Good game to introduce someone to deck-building.  I don't think that the cards are properly balanced though; this leads to a lack of depth and strategy.  There are really cheap cards that can win you the game quite quickly.

I did like that you attack your opponent, feels of MTG.  But with the lack of depth the game offers, it isn't something I would want to play often, if ever again when I can play Ascension.

Ascension blows this game out of the water.

Very fun game! Quick to set up and easy to learn. However, new players will struggle against veterans who have honed strategies and some games quickly become unbalanced. That said, an unbalanced game will end quickly and you can just play another. I'd say about 1 out of every 5 or so games is unbalanced due to luck of cards available in the market. My wife and I play this game very regularly and on a number of occasions lose 2 or more hours with countless number of games played.

RATING: 6
If you love Star Realms, there's no reason you wouldn't like Hero Realms. But is it worth owning both? For those who haven't played either, both are small, competitive deck-building games where you purchase cards from an evolving market and directly attack your opponent, the objective being to reduce their life to zero - sort of a cross between Magic and Dominion. While the balance of cards has been tweaked and the color-focus changed between the two games, there is only one rule difference that I noticed. Defenders (champions and guards) are tapped when their abilities are used. There is a new ability "Prepare" which allows you to untap them so that their ability can be used more than once in a turn. The equivalent stations in Star Realms can only be used once. As far as I can tell, that's the only difference! One slight criticism is that the type-face and symbols on Hero Realms cards is smaller, so factions and text are not as easily readable.

I didn't love Star Realms when I first played it, but I got a copy for my son for Christmas one year as an easy way to introduce him to deck-builders and I've played it with him a lot. I appreciate how well my son took to the game and the time together it has given us, so I now have a soft spot for Star Realms. The phone app is quite good as well. I'm knocking Hero Realms a point because, well, it's been done before. The publishers have indicated going in a different direction with expansions, creating unique starting decks that are character-based, bosses to cooperatively defeat, and campaign-style play. So far, only the character decks have been published. For now, I would say it is not different enough to be worth owning both, but we'll see if the expansions can change that impression.

Same game as Star Realms (although tiny nits make me rate that game higher). Pick the theme you prefer. If the base set of Star Realms supported 4 players I would suggest that over this, but Hero Realms matches up to Star Realms + Colony Wars for slightly better value. It is a 9 as an entry-level deck builder but I'm rating as a 8 because of the chunkiness at 3 & 5 players (you can play 2v2 pretty easily). Takes only 20 minutes per 2p play and you can teach + play in only 30 minutes for 2 players.

Much easier to teach and play then something like Dominion (so obviously easier than just about all other "advanced" deck builders). Has explosive plays and even when you lose it feels very close (usually). Some might feel there is too much 'luck' in this game as you will struggle to break a 70% win rate regardless of how good you are, but I think that is a good thing, especially in an entry-level game. 

Everyone should have either Hero Realms or Star Realms in their collection. Take them out when at least one person at the table has never played a deck builder.

This game is the "Sequel" of sorts to Star Realms.  While it uses the same mechanism, it's not just Star Realms with a new skin.  The game starts faster and hits harder.  The character packs speed it up even more by reducing the number of ordinary cards in the starting deck. This game was made with planned campaign mode and that has an influence on it's design and balance.  This makes some of the low cost cards feel insanely overpowered.

I think I'll really enjoy Hero Realms' campaign once it's released.  I do enjoy this deck builder very much, but I still prefer its predecessor.

A clear game to avoid if you don't like deck builders and possibly even if you do.  This game has player elimination, balance issues, clear advantage to certain strategies, so similar to other deck builders.  Heros and guards are easily dispatched making it very unlikely you will have them more than one round.  

Caveats/bias: played once (I am an experienced gamer though) and did not play with anything more than the base game.  I also do not enjoy deck builders generally.

Fantasy version of the Realms series. A better game than the previous Star and Cthulhu realms simply because they managed to tk-ake the stuff that worked from said games.

Absolutely stunning artwork!

I prefer having one less faction/colour (like in Cthulhu realms) since that means more combos and thus more fun/amazing turns. Now it's easy to get a market where nothing really entices you.

Really fun. Probably the one I'd recommend.

Alapvetően  ugyanaz, mint a Star Realms, de egy kicsit több képesség került bele, mondhatni némileg bonyolultabb. Az illusztrációk nagyon szépek, ha valakinek nagyon fontos az ilyen téma nélküli játékokban ez, és előnyben részesíti a Hero Realms grafikáit a Star Realmshoz képest, akkor nyilván ez a nyerő. Viszont én egy kicsit hiányolom a Star Realms eleganciáját. Az is tény, hogy a Hero Realmset 2vs2 módban próbáltam csak, úgy számomra nehezebben követhetőnek, hosszúnak tűnt, mert azért van mit böngészni a lapokon. Szóval jó játék, de maradok a Star Realmsnél.

This is another variations of Star Realms (which I love). I like the theme but seems to be unbalanced when player character vs. character using just the base set. However, the solo / co-op expansion where you fight bosses or go through a campaign with your characters being able to "level-up" makes it much more appealing.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Played the base game first and it was fine and felt much the same as Star Realms in a different setting. The character deck added a bit of diversity, but I wonder if certain characters are not balanced against certain other characters? Just conjecture, but it felt like in my one game the rogue was pretty much able to cancel out my cleric's ability most turns. To be fair, the rogue also had a couple fortunate purchase options which really kowtowed my cleric's ability.

Nice short game with a real easy learningcurve. This is Star Realms on steroroids, fixing everything that where just marginally wrong.
admittedly there is the paradox that what makes this game great is also what makes it fall a bit short of stardom. The simple(but fun) mechanic is good for at few plays but won't stand up to a entire evening and would leave a feeling of wanting more.
I've yet to play it with more than 2 players

It is a deck-building game with some elements of a TCG.   It had two currencies: Gold and Combat, and each player has an amount of Health.   What we observed was that the various "factions" of cards wind up building your deck more or less like a "class" i.e., rogue, mage, druid, priest..  It was very interesting and I'll have to try it again.

Oddly enough, we felt its greatest weakness was the name, which did not bring us in mind of the kind of game it was at all.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A cross between a deck building and magic the gathering.  You have different starting decks for each character type that each has a specific ability with a one time use and an ongoing use that makes the character interesting.  

You buy from a central set of cards and attack.  You must attack guards, but can attack other champions as well.  Cards of the same faction unlock abilities that help you.  

This is a fun, quick game where you try to take out your opponent.  I like the game a lot.

Gameplay and rules are the same as star realms but ramps faster and much more dramatic :D Of course the theme is a favorite of mine. We played one with the base set and then my friend bought a copy and 3 character packs and we played with Cleric and Ranger. The character decks makes the game so much more strategic and amazing! :D

RATING: 8
Very good, simple to learn deck builder. Serves as a great gateway to the mechanic, yet holds up with more experienced gamers too. I enjoy this theme much more than Star Realms and love how easy it is to get into a game.  It plays just fine with 2, but really excels with 3 or 4 players.

I had five character packs (cleric, thief, fighter, wizard, ranger), two boss decks (the lich and the dragon), the Ruin of Thandar Campaign Deck, and the Kickstarter promo/exclusive cards.

We LOVE Star Realms, and we were hoping this would be a fantasy version of that game. It was. And it wasn't. The rules are basically the same, but the cards felt horribly unbalanced in terms of cost vs ability. Both games we played, one of us obliterated the other, whereas we're usually evenly matched in Star Realms. 

We also felt like the choices for purchase were less interesting because the factions (red, blue, yellow, green) weren't as distinct as in Star Realms, providing less variability from game to game--in other words, the way to win was always the same. If you were the first person who could get the big heal cards, you were going to win, especially if you could deny those cards to your opponent.

We didn't try the cooperative mode because the competitive one left such a bad taste in our mouths. We'll stick to Star Realms.

RATING: 3
Like Star Realms, I don't see the appeal of this game.  Besides the balance of the game being terrible, the decision making in this game is minimal at best.  You simply play all of your cards and your purchasing decisions are often very obvious (get the most expensive card) and the game just goes on auto pilot depending on what you draw.  At least Monopoly had some decision making.

Compared to other deckbuilders like Dominion and Draconis Invasion, I will probably not touch Star Realms or Hero Realms again.

Played 15-16 times. This works well as a 2-pl with my son (age 12). You can get really lucky or really unlucky with the card market, and sometimes you buy a reasonably good card only to fill up with a card that is perfect for your opponent. However, games are usually short and fun if played casually.

The unique starting decks and abilities of each class are a nice addition that add a bit of asymmetry and thus, replayability.  Our first game wasn't quite as fast as Star Realms, since we're not able to cycle through our decks (either through scrapping or drawing) as quickly.  It needs a few more plays to tell.  Tentative rating is same as Star Realms.

+ Unique starting decks offer asymmetry
- Combos don't feel as epic as in Star Realms

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is an interesting spin on Star Realms with a lot of promise. This first edition, however, suffers from a lot of balance issues and rule confusion.

It feels like this is a great game that was released too early in development to really be worth a purchase. The manual does not do a good job of explaining the game play and the deck suffers from horrible balance issues. Incredibly powerful cards with very little cost show up constantly and as a result, expensive cards are never worth purchasing.

This makes for incredibly short, very random victories. This game will likely work itself out when they get around to creating a second edition to work out the kinks. It does, however, feel better with 4 people than trying to shoehorn 4 players into a Star Realms game.

The new campaign expansion raised my opinion of this game a full number rating!

A nice version of the Deckbuilder-Realms series. If you're new to the series, I would probably stick to this one. It's a bit cleaner than the others.

Tried it at GenCon 2016. Just played the 'regular' game without special characters or classes so it basically felt like a reskinned Star Realms. But because the cards are so much more powerful there is very little buildup time. Just didn't like it as much as Star Realms.

RATING: N/A
Actually a fun, quick little deckbuilder (when playing solo)

Only problem is that it seems very random in that the cards on offer in the market can be quite random and so far you just buy whatever is available without any realm strategy - which is very different to Dominion

Not sure if I like it yet or not.  Will need to play a bit more and try and only buy certain cards from certain spheres to see if a strategy can be formed

Pros

-Strategic
-Fun deck building
-Easy to learn and setup
-4 players out of the box
-Different game modes
-Awesome combos
-20 bucks
-"just one more game" feel

Cons

-Bad luck of the draw can hurt you

The company behind it not only made a great game but also offers allot of bang for your buck. Set up time takes a few minutes and teaching players takes less. Even though its simple to learn there is a strong element of strategy to this game. Its amazing how well Hero Realms scale with more players. Very little downtime and the reward for good planning feels extremely satisfying. Building your deck as you play adds variety of interesting choices. The only downside i found is that the luck of the draw can hurt you but with careful planning this is manageable.

Overall this game is pretty damn good and I find it to be extremely satisfying .

RATING: 7.5
Very Similar to Star Realms; a fast deckbuilder that is firmly between Magic: the Gathering and Dominion.  Compared to its predecessor this game is a bit more refined with some mechanics better balanced and less truly overpowered cards.  The gameplay itself is a bit more visceral with actions and champions doing a bit more damage than ships and bases, but this is balanced by better lifegain actions.

Very nice mixture of Star Realms and Epic. Plays like Realms games, but has some of the epicness from Epic, as the powers are generally stronger. Very nice. The different sets available in the KS campaign confused me a bit, so I ended up with the very basic set, and it is quite fine. 

For three-player games, I would recommend last man standing (free for all or hunter, I'm not sure yet) instead of first blood.

Suggest.

So far this just seems like an upgrade to Star Realms.  There is a lot more focus on "bases", and the game has been re-balanced to address it.  The sequence of play on your turn as well as the decisions you make for building your deck seem to matter a lot more in this game, which is a good thing.

(Rating includes Hero Packs expansion)

This was the first game that really got me into board games. For the first few weeks of play, I would have rated this game a 10. Deck building was such a new concept, that added so many ways to play. The heros were fun and unique. The game was a blast to play.

Now, I think I've exhausted myself on the game. It's still a lot of fun and I probably wouldn't turn down a game, but it's been replaced by Dominion for me. Hero realms has too much luck, too little variety, and is too simplistic to last long term. 

It's not a bad game by any means, and I will continue to play and enjoy it. Everyone I've introduced it too has had a blast with it. Even if it has fallen to be only an "average" game(for me at least), it introduced me to a whole new world of gaming, for which I am grateful.

The latest in the "Realms" series shows that the formula is nowhere near being stale. Hero Realms feels like a more focused and refined version of Star Realms, as the starting decks have a little more variety, and you can even add in hero-specific cards through expansions. I also really like the fact that this takes place in the same world as Epic. Like its predecessors, however, this may end up getting played-out after some time. In its defense, it does come with noticeably more cards out of the box, which is reassuring. Time will tell if this sticks around, but for now I'm enjoying it very much.

7 plays - This really did not hit the mark. It's a good enough deck building/ duel game, but it really 'plays itself' a lot of the time. Ultimately, it is the fact that players are faced with very lack-luster and uninteresting decisions to make. Rarely are decisions tough or thought-provoking and in many cases there are not any at all. Playing your hand is very linear and attacking your opponents health/ minions is almost always prioritized in the same way.  

There were also some games I played where players had built decks around healing and the game become so, so, so prolonged (I believe this is supposed to be a relatively quick game) to the point where I would just deliberately underplay my cards so I would lose (and end the game). 

The market availability feels like there is quite a lot of luck involved. Playing against the first boss felt quite linear.

After playing a four player game with each player on their own, I came away enjoying the mechanics however I found the length and downtime to be a bit too much. Thus we decided to play two versus two and it was much better. The downtime is almost non existent and the randomness of whom to attack is also removed. You are able to buy better cards earlier on as you share purchasing power as well as health, guards and you attack together. The cards have the standard mix of types with one being focused on attacks, one on health and so on, nothing overly original, yet it was a lot of fun to play when playing two on two and the mechanics are as simple as can be for these games. You also don't have a huge collection of cards on the board to keep track of and the are no instants or counters. The new variant adds a boss which makes the game many versus one, which I also enjoyed.

Yay! So excited to give this one a play! I did KS the game and am very much looking forward to the final production copy. This is very much like star realms and if you like that one you will most likely enjoy this one. They are essentially the same but bases are "heroes" and they can be tapped and possibly untapped in a single turn so you have to plan wisely and get the good cards. Also, there is a really fine chance of collecting tons of life if the cards fall correctly. I was up over 80 life when I beat Ron. He, needless to say, wasn't a big fan of this game. I am sure it will grow on him, however.

Suffers from the same problems than Star Realms, but makes poor luck even more punishing, thanks to the market cards being more powerful, and your starting hands containing cards with a value of 2. A bad starting draw leaves you behind a lot, and the life gain determines the winner alone.

Worthless without character packs.

Did you like Star Realms?  Here's more Star Realms.
New art and more stations (cards that stick around between rounds), but otherwise the same mechanics and card abilities.
The idea of being able to play as different classes with custom starting decks is new... but is functionally insignificant.  Each class has a couple unique cards, but they all play nearly identically.   It's mostly just set dressing.

Each of the factions have many cards that I simply love, as well as great potential (and thematic) combos.  Besides, it has both zombies and dragons.  Who doesn't love that?  LOL.  This is such a great game!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Yes.  All day long, yes.  I enjoyed Star Realms and this game stepped it up a notch with the character packs.  Those character packs are a must.

This is a game that fires on all cylinders, for me.  It's quick, easy to understand, great combos, fun factions.

My only complaint - and it's kind of a major complaint - is that I can't fit all the cards in the box.  What the hell is that?  I need to have either a companion container for the rest of the cards or use a generic container for the entire game.  Fortunately, there are larger boxes now available.

I backed this on Kickstarter, since I really enjoyed their previous Star Realms game.  I really like the variation of the theme with this new version.  It is a lot of fun to play, simple to set up, and just plays well.  My wife, who is not much of a gamer, even enjoys it.  She likes it so much, she bugs ME to play it.  :-)

(07/13/2016) - Backed at the Adventurer Tier on Kickstarter. Expected delivery of October 2016.

(11/04/2016) - The main game and character packs arrived today! Looking forward to playing this, as I love Star Realms.

(12/18/2016) - [9] - I had some concerns about how similar Hero Realms' gameplay might be to Star Realms. I can safely say that there is enough adjustment and variation here to provide a fresh and engaging experience. I find the theme more immersive as well.

A re-themed version of Star Realms (essentially). I actually like it better and the character packs are great. I'm a fan of this game. It's so good for just a quick little deck builder. Wishing the box were designed in such a way as to hold everything organized along with the character packs.

Fantasy Star Realms: works for me! What is to like - up to 4p out of the box - and what a box - compact and sturdy. I bought it with 4 character packs, they definitely add a lot of colour. The game is subject to snow-balling quicker than Star Realms, which so far for my son and me is a big plus, as it levels the playing field somewhat between us. I think this is going to see a lot of play at home.

Tipikus pénzcsinálás, kiadták a korábbi játékukat egy új köntösben. A játék teljesen ugyanazt az élményt adja, mint elődje a Star Realms, csak itt fantasy környzet váltja a sci-fit. Itt az űrbázisokat hősök testesítik meg. Újítás, hogy különböző kasztokkal indulhatunk, amik különböző kezdőlapokat és életerőpontot jelentenek, de nekem ez csak veszélyezteti a kiegyensúlyozottságot. El kell ismernem a grafika gyönyörű, de a szövegeket mérete szerintem kisebb, de legalábbis nehezebben olvasható, mint az előd kártyáin. A pontok számolására kitalált két kártya prakitikussága mindenképpen jó pont, ettől függetlenül egy ponttal kevesebbet adok rá, de csak a rokabőr miatt, amúgy ugyanolyan élvezetes és jó, mint az előd.

Possibly the best deck-building game on the market. The artwork is stellar, the gameplay mixes the tried and true Star Realms formula with elements from Epic. The result is incredibly fun to play and just with the base set already proves to be more deep than Star Realms.

Plays exactly like Star Realms but everything is tuned just a bit higher so decks get running just a bit faster. It makes the game pace better since it's basically filler anyway. I wouldn't have bought it except for the hero decks which add a lot to the experience.

RATING: 7
This is a review for the base game PLUS the character packs. The base game alone is pretty identical to Star Realms and thus not particularly recommended on its own. 

While it is still plagued by over-randomness both in the deck drawing and market row of cards to buy, Hero Healms is a step above its predecessor Star Realms in that it offers players the option of picking premade starting decks with cards that add a bit of strategy. This allows players to make 3 additional choices that may affect the game. 
1- what starting deck to use 
2- when to use the ability card
3- whether to use the skill each turn. 

By adding in the expansion (Ruin of Thandar) the game is elevated to a solid adventure game with decent player choice and delightful flavor. Get the expansion. It makes an okay game a wonderful experience.

Slightly better than Star Realms, but not by much. Still suffers from what seems to be a run away leader problem especially in the first few hands (if someone gets something big early it is hard to stop them). Also, I feel like there is a good chance of high cost cards clogging up the middle row which is annoying.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This game is my favorite card game (as is Star Realms). Everyone plays with the same cards, builds their play decks on the fly to their liking to beat the opponent, which makes this a very strategic and tactical game without spending money constantly like Magic: The Gathering or pre-building decks. This game is also fun with 3, 4, or even 6 people. 5 people is the only one that seems a little unlikely but it's still possible as you could play it similar to a 3 player 1st eliminated loses and person that killed them is the winner.
It's interesting to see how this game is branching in a different direction compared to Star Realms with the option of choosing a class deck to start with along with the future monster decks and future campaign play style.

Just received the hero realms kickstarter package... not impressed at all... is it me or are these drawings very small and lower quality than usual, certainly on this more hard carton it seems and feels bad.
Also the rules have some problems... like the "market deck", is explained nowhere. They just assume you know what the market deck is... is it all the rest of all the other cards? Or just a certain type? 
This is sort of recycling the star realms gimmick with a bunch or art from Epic card game... with a ton of very confusing game setup things.  Don't like it one bit.

I remember enjoying my few plays of [thing=147020][/thing] when it first came out, and I'm more of a fantasy fan than sci-fi, so I was excited to play fantasy Star Realms.  The new version isn't significantly different from the original, but it fell flat with me.  I just felt like there weren't many decisions, and you can get a runaway leader in a hurry.  Unlike Dominion, for example, there are virtually no decisions to be made about which cards you play or the sequence that you play them.  The purchasing is also fairly straightforward, as you just buy the most expensive card and/or the card that matches the colors of all your other cards.

I still applaud the game for being as deep as it is with just a deck of cards.  But, it's still not very deep, and I don't think I need to play this or the original any time soon.

I've paid four times more for games I didn't get a tenth of the enjoyment out of. Considering it's a 20 buck first installment, I just about could say it's perfect, because it lacks real flaws and in terms of improvement, future installments can grow it. In the mean time, super fun as is... Be sure to visit the site for rules on the Tibus mode if you can't wait for the solo/co op expansion
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Played the solo game to learn the rules. The solo game itself is bad. Tibus just kept healing himself mostly, so it was only a matter of time before I killed him off. His "clear the market row" ability was usually a good thing since it gives the player access to more cards. Luckily the solo/co-op modes aren't the primary mode, and they're obviously just tacked on for marketing purposes.

The game itself seems great though. The character packs really add a lot to the game. As the ranger, I kept drawing cards and taking advantage of my bow and arrow abilities.

Will rate after more plays.

Have the base kickstarter pledge. Played it a few times now. It seems quite good and  has some advantages over Star Realms in terms of the cards, tracking damage and number of players. It's hard to justify owning this and Star Realms, they're basically the same game. We still haven't managed to get the play time down to the 20 minutes the suggested on the box. Perhaps the expansions or campaign might add something different but the game is always going to be star realms.

Deck building game. You have a starting deck, draw 5 cards and use them. With money you can purchase cards from the market to put into your deck, with "soldier" cards you can attack the others or defend yourself. The last man standing wins.
I don't like this game. There is not really much you can do. You just pick up your hand and use each and every card of it, then your turn is over and it's the next players turn. There is no strategic decisions in this game.
This rating however is based on my dislike for deck building games so it shouldn't be taken too seriously :)

While Star Realms felt pretty mediocre to me, I can't really explain why Hero Realms is markedly more enjoyable for me.  I do far prefer the artwork, the gameplay feels more thematic tying figures together than just random ships.  The combo's feel like they have a bit more depth to them, turns are more grandiose and feel akin to Magic or a LCG.  The asymmetrical characters really add some interest to the early game.

Character packs are nice but not essential.  Have: Cleric, fighter, Ranger, Thief, and Wizard.  Ranger is my favorite.  Play game without expansions before you buy them.  Identical to Star Realms but feels different somehow.

We were hesitant to get this because we already had Star Realms and love it.  But Rob prefers a fantasy theme to space, and we've already played this just as much as Star Realms. Love the different characters you can play.  Great game!

Slightly better version of Star Realms.

Changes are mostly superficial/aesthetical but the most important difference is the pacing of the game. There's a lot more chances to make a comeback with some well timed healing cards which is both a blessing and a curse. The comebacks, when succesful, are epic but they sometimes bloat the game length a bit too much. This is especially problematic when playing with more than 2 players.

The Hero expansions are also a nice touch of variety and I'm optimistic about the upcoming stuff as well.

Great head to head card game that has many game modes. Fantastic art and quality components. Each of the four factions feels different. Head to head and co-op are both solid and I'm not a co-op fan.

fantastic game.  I played star realms a lot on my phone and literally the day I added it to my cart white wizard announced this game.  I love the fantasy theme a lot better and I love how fluid this game is.  I feel like it is a small deck builder that packs a huge punch and really gives me the feeling of attacking my opponent.

RATING: 7
Mechanically, the competitive game nearly mirrors Star Realms. If the cooperative mode pans out as well as promised, than this game may completely replace Star Realms (one of my favorites) in my collection.

Hero Realms offers better value, in that a single base set supports 4 players and the life trackers are superior. The theme is kind of weird, in that it almost-but-not-quite mirrors that of Epic Card Game (which is also by White Wizard Games). I do miss the quick visual distinction of orientation (i.e. landscape = "stays on table" vs. portrait = "gets discarded") used in Star Realms.

The creators of STAR REALMS explore other parts of the design space -- campaigns, characters, multiplayer, new card effects -- and lose some of that game's perfect elegance in the process. The choice to import EPIC CARD GAME's cluttered card design was an unforced error. Still, as deckbuilders go, this is a fine one, and the White Wizard boys have left themselves room to grow.

The art is fantastic, and I like that it is portable and easy to teach. I find that games tend to drag on a bit longer than games of Star Realms, mainly because powers  seem to ramp up faster, which detracts somewhat from the filler nature of the simple game mechanics.

Copying Star Realms and not improving the glaring issues is not acceptable. Variable starting decks are a good idea and should be implemented in every deckbuilder where it is thematically appropriate, however.

A decent deck building combative game. I like the artwork more than Star Realms but slightly prefer the play of Star Realms. I have not played with the expansions which are supposed to help it.
I don't really feel there is much depth to this and not sure expansions would help with that either. There never seems to be enough real decisions to make and it feels too light.

This version ends as quickly as the original. Whether that's good or bad is up to you.  Personally, I don't see enough to distinguish it from Star Realms - except for cards that are perhaps even more OP.

[url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/221368/dc-deck-building-game-confrontations]DC Deck-Building: Confrontations[/url] would seem to have more variety and longevity, but I won't know for sure until it's released.

Not sure what it is, I do like Ascension and I don't dislike Star Realms nor Hero Realms. However it doesn't click totally. I like the class specific cards. However I'm not sure all heroes are balanced.

I found myself not liking this game very much, and actually being disappointed by most aspects. The art is cheesy generic fantasy, and it is a bit busy for the cards, making cards a lot harder to recognize than in the original Star Realms. Changing Bases to Champions, and aligning them vertically means that they are harder to recognize, and play correctly. I will keep playing Star Realms.

Maybe I'm wanting Hero Realms to be too much like Ascension. Attacking each other is fine, but something about the game doesn't seem to sit well with me. You play weapons and champions to "attack" the other player, but what ARE the players, with their relatively massive 50 health pool? The characterization of the Hero Realms world also seem more generic than Ascension or Thunderstone. 

It is cheaper and more portable than either, which is a decent point in its favor.

The escalation of decks happens quickly, although this also makes the game feel less balanced than Ascension.

A szokásos minőség a Star Realms kiagyalóitól. Gyors, szép, no-brainer deckbuilding, pont ahogy szeretjük, csak sci-fi helyett fantasy környezetben. Az a pár újdonság pedig pont elég, h rákattanj erre is.

Have the finished product via KS.   The Star Realms engine has been improved on and the class decks plus abilities add a great new layer even with the basic co-op scenario provided.

Because its both bad AND misses the point of the whole damn thing.

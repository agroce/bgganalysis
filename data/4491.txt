RATING: 6
Enjoyed playing it with my role-playing group, but the game just isn't very polished
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is more of a Euro than would seem at first. Players try to score rooms with heroes in them to gain victory points. Monsters are used to attack your opponents' heroes. The game is only moderately fun with 2 players, but I have a feeling it is much better with 3+.

RATING: 6.5
Not a bad little strategy game for four. The only downside I saw was confusion over which rooms had been scored. There's a tendency to score a room more than once, due to the layout of the board. Other than that, it's an interesting play with some good selection of choices in a turn.

Got this out at lunch time, and had a 4 player game.  It was great fun, we managed to learn the rules and play in 1:15 - and the next game will be faster.  Lots of options, a bit of strategy, and the fun of smiting your friends with a cave troll...  Cool!

A fatally flawed area control game. The fact that all players have exactly the same actions in the game makes the whole game a frustrating tug war. If you wanted to design an area control game, make the players use their wits and compete for the best actions. Only then will it be interesting. A symmetrical game boils down to everyone just counteracting each other. In Cave Troll, the only thing breaking the symmetry is the order in which players draw their cards. This is a stupid choice since it takes all cunning out of the game and replaces it with sheer luck. Furthermore, it is very hard to distinguish the characters from each other -> paint job required. 

If I am ever to play this again, it will be four players. Three is an absolute no-no because when two players start to rip each other throats, the third has already won. And I reckon the game will be simply boring with two because the map is huge for two players only. 

Well, for a symmetric area control game Cave Troll is not bad. The thing just is that symmetry just does not work in a game like this. Hence, the low rating. However, points for the good production value, swift play and an excellent rule book (for a Fantasy Flight game).

RATING: 1
This game has some interesting ideas but really struggles for really only being a multiplayer area control Euro. I'm convinced there are way too many of these games already. 

It's certainly not a 2er game at all. The mechanisms are all about kingmaking moves and luck-of-the-draw. 

Probably ok for 2002, but even games I detest like Small World do this a lot better.

I thought this was on OK game. But there's too much take-that for a multi-player game. How well you do depends as much on how well you play as on the extent to which other players decide to hurt you.

Nice miniatures, but the game never reaches its full potential. The main culprit is likely the meager number of choices in terms of card play (your card hand is a perpetual one, as you start with one card and if you draw a card, you must play one of the two cards in your hand).

There are many better games out there.

I first rated this an 8, but we've had a couple of wierd sessions where players have had unusually good or unusually bad draws - which ended up determining the game.  If I think of a way to deal with this - then I'll bump up the rating again.  Otherwise this is a fun, quick influence game.

{1 play • 4 player} I like it so far :)  Yeah, the luck of the tiles can be weird - My last five were all "special" ones: Orc, Wraith, Amulet, Knight, Scoring... and I never flipped them because the game ended before it got to me again (I came in 2nd, by the way) - but you can kind of see who the "leader" is and act accordingly.  Which means this game may not be for you.  Heck, *I'm* not that fond of games where all players must "see" the board and then balance things out, but the crazy luck, quick playing time, and the newness of it (to me) made it okay.  The dungeon looks cool, but some of the tokens are hard to tell apart (though the art on them is nice, as well).

decent.  i acquired this before the reprint with minis was announced, and back then it was yet another crapped-upon silver line game.  funny how production and more name notoriety can change things.  i'd like to check out the new edition's rules and see if anything has changed or can be adapted, because certain character appearances were very dominating depending on what the opponent had.  it played fine with two.  ended up trading or selling because it languished on the shelf.

Nice simple game.  Like many of the FF Silver line games this game is almost fantasy in theme but could have been anything.  Fairly easy to play with two types of play types.

Overall a good game with interesting elements.  I can't rate it higher as the randomness when the cards come into play impacts the result.  If the cards all had equal value, then it wouldn't be a big deal.  But if some players get their Cave Troll into play and others don't, that can be a significant scoring difference.  If I had some choice as to when this would happen, I wonder if it would improve the game.

RATING: 4.3
Besides the chaos, kingmaking, random luckfest and inherent problems with these kinda area control games, I found the very small map, cards and miniatures very frustrating to play with. Most of the time you cannot clearly see what figures are in an area. Forgettable experience. I cannot understand why the game was not printed on a bigger map, bigger cards and bigger miniatures or even using clearly distinguishable tokens instead. If everything was double the size I would probably rate it a 6 and it would at least be playable.

Recieved in trade.  Looks good.

update: Played.  A good game with plenty to think about.  You can't do everything you want, and are often torn between wanting to limit your opponents and help yourself.  Good game, quick and fun.

Update: The game is fairly abstract, plays well with any number as you really have to maximise your scoring opportunities and balance scoring for yourself and taking out your opponent.

I enjoy this area control game from time to time.  
It is good for three players, I havent yet played it with four.  

Dont bother using the second set of special abilities, they are significantly different and far more "lethal".  That might sound like fun but it isnt.  To stick with the original guys would be my advice.

It is not a dungeoncrawl type game, despite what the theme may suggest.

Really more of an area control game than a dungeon crawl, but the theme appeals to me more than in most area control games.  The components could be a couple notches better, but this is what kept the cost way down.  Good game.

RATING: 6
My ranking system:

-1 to 2 points in five categories. Netting a range of scores from -5 to 10. Any total below 1 is scored as a 1 on BGG. For more information see my geek list: http://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/147053/item/2300390#item2300390


1) Sense of wonder: 1. This game is virtually the same from game to game and provides little variation. However it does have fantasy "flavor" and variable player powers which I am a sucker for.

2) Meaningful/fun decisions. 2. Lots of tough, fun decisions from beginning to end. Nail biting choices.

3) Player interaction: 2. Lots of interaction. Area control game that is all about keeping an eye on what your opponents are doing and snatching their weak areas out from under them.

4) Components/artwork:  2. Fantastic minis and artwork. Very flavorful components. 

5) Game length/complexity: 2. Great length of game and complexity. It is not hard to learn, but tough to master.

Total score: 9

Bottom line: Lots of fun. I got rid of it long ago, but kind of wish I had it back as I really did enjoy it and would like to play it again.

I like this game.  Fun and easy, and with a decent amount of strategy as you try to balance your actions between moving or drawing tiles.  I have one of the earlier printings (maybe the first) which used round markers for characters and treasures and such, and apparently the newer version plays differently.  I wouldn't know.  I like it the way it is.

RATING: 4
About as completely mediocre on every level as you could possibly imagine.  
Why Fantasy Flight is revamping some of their _least_ interesting games is beyond me- between this game and DRAKON it seems like resources could have been used more effectively.  What's next?  QUICKSAND with miniatures?  Anyway, the first edition was actually one of the earlier "hybrid" games and it really shows- this is really just a Euro-style area control game with a dungeon theme.  Unfortunately, it's not a very interesting area control game since there never seems to be the right amount of competition for areas.  There are some cool ideas (like controlling both monsters and heroes and the inclusion of a "nuke", the titular Cave Troll) but it just comes across as really shoddy.  The new edition offers better art and cards rather than tokens as well as what appear to be some really awesome miniatures in photos but they're really just small, hard-to-discern figures that I could have done without.  The game is pretty much useless for 2 and 3 players, is at least a mildly entertaining diversion for 4, and ultimately so mediocre that it really isn't worth your time unless you just really want a 30 minute, fantasy themed game of this type.

RATING: 7.25
The quintessential board control game, a thoughtful game where everyone has the same tools to work with but your strategy has to constantly evolve to your opponents' moves and blocks.  Counting up score can be a bit cumbersome but the track helps keep it in check.  The pieces have a very chesslike setup to them where there is a group of pawns with no real ability and then limited specialized pieces that you have to carefully control and place to nab the maximum loot.

Compares to Chaos in the Old World, but is less random, more player symmetric, and shorter. No dice.

Game length on box can be easily doubled by AP. Rules regarding Wraith are broken.

Game needs to be house ruled. Untried house rules under consideration:
(a) Increase initial hand of cards to 3.
(b) Replace draw/play action with draw 2 THEN (place one card at bottom of deck AND play one card).
(c) Replace draw/play with: Initial hand size is entire deck, action to PLAY a card.
(d) Special hero/monster cards may summon any special of the same type rather than just the indicated unit.

Just got in my first play of this one.  I enjoyed it, but I was only playing with 2 players and I really think the game needs more.  There's just too much area to spread into, so most of the special abilities never get used.  It might be possible to play on just half of the map with 2 players, which would help considerably.

I'm going to try to get in a play with 4 players soon.

Quick playing area majority and action point game and highly interactive as players directly compete by playing monster cards and hero cards to jockey for position and there are few spawn points. Works best with 4 players to make the board a tighter arena. Needs variable board setup or multiple balanced boards and more hero cards.

RATING: 6
It has gotten better with more plays, but there is still something lacking.  At least it is quick, most games are resolved in a half an hour or so.  The winner usually seems to be the person who goes through their tokens first.  If you spend a lot of your actions moving things around to improve your position, you seem to get left behind.

RATING: 4
Fun game where players are trying to form majorities of pieces (a typical mechanic from European games) in dungeon rooms.  Players take four actions per turn, drawing their pieces or moving them around the dungeon.  Four scoring occasions during the game occur semi-randomly, and sadly you do need your dwarf and/or treasure chest out there early if you're going to win.  Flaws an otherwise fun game.

RATING: 7
I found this game to be mathematical, but not overly dry or subject to analysis paralysis. The dungeon theme is the icing on the cake. Plays in about an hour (less with 2 players) and is a good deal of fun. Random tile draws insure that no two games are ever alike, since the powerful characters/monster will appear at different times, thus changing the overall game dynamic considerably. Occasionally, though, this is also the game's greatest weakness... once in a blue moon, one player will get all of his or her "heroes" and monster up front, and sway the game balance early on.

*update* Just received the 2nd edition, and it looks great so far. It's a little harder to tell who's where in the dungeon due to the plastic figures, but I'll get used to it. Overall it seems an improvement- a nicer edition.

Cave Troll proved enjoyable (due in large part to the theme), but it's really not deep enough to play regularly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This has a fantasy theme, but it's really just an area-control game. Its distinguishing feature is its utter mediocrity. There just isn't an interesting game here; it's too easy to figure out where you need to go--and it pays off if everyone mostly avoids each other. It almost feels like there should be more competitiveness and cutthroat turns of fortune packed into the half-hour of play; using the word "leisurely" to describe a game named "Cave Troll" is apropos but unfortunate.

Also, the artifact cards (or rather, the timing involved in drawing and playing them) are just far too random compared to the rest of the gameplay. 

I won't usually turn down an offer to play this game, but there's no way I'll ever suggest it.

Fewer options with more players makes it more interesting (I'd think).  But I may never know as I traded it away...

05/11/07--Not particularly great with 2; but I can see potential in the system.  I want to try this with 3 or 4 to see how that affects things. With two, you can evaluate the board with near certainty.  Plus, the worst part is that there is so much juicy treasure on the board, you're better off just going where your opponent isn't and maxing your score that way rather than put your guys at risk in a more central location.  There's just too much treasure to go around.I'll tell you what, though...the plastic bits in this game sure are nice, I'll give it that.---
EDIT:  Traded away.  This entry should be proof that nice plastic bits can't sway my opinion if a game isn't very good...and this one just isn't.

RATING: 9
Read the rules before you buy to make sure it's the sort of game you think it is (i.e., area control; it's not really a dungeon crawl).  I knew this going in and greatly enjoy it.  The random tile draw adds a fair bit of luck, especially the timing of the scoring rounds, but there are plenty of opportunities for clever play.

I actually prefer the cardboard counters of the first edition to the plastic of the second.  However, one nicety of the second edition is the improved timing of the scoring.  In the first edition, drawing the Count the Loot counter would cause scoring.  In the second edition, each card increments a scoring timer by various amounts.  I may try to adapt something similar for first edition.

RATING: 5
Light area majority with special abilities game - Risk - place your heroes and monsters into the dungeon, move them between rooms and use the abilities of your major heroes and monsters to control the treasure in particular rooms by having the most heroes present - scoring is triggered by the number of heroes played - highest score at game end wins. Simple fun game, lots of player interaction. Subject to the usual Risk issue of king making - the winner is often the player who interacts the least. Good components.

No, it's not a dungeon crawler. It's a light area control game when everything changes very quickly. You use some characters and monsters with special abilities to take over and occupy the most valuable rooms to get points for them when scoring. It's quick and fun but the luck factor can be very important. Is spite of this my wife loves it. Best with 3-4 players. Edit: recently we take four tiles on hand and use them instead of drawing from the stack. At the end of your turn you just replenish your hand. It works very good.

A quick fun little game. Likely better with three or four, as the board is quite empty, and makes for easy point grabs with two players. I haven't tried the first ed., but the minis look great, and the gameplay is fast and easy. One I recommend if you're looking for fast, easy fantasy themed gameplay.

My kids like this one. More for the minis than the area control gameplay. But, it is a neat little game that is small quick and portable.

This is an okay area control game. Having orcs and trolls at your command in addition to heroes and your average adventurer types sounds really fun, but it doesn't play out quite as excitingly as it sounds. It's a good game that I would play again, but there are plenty of others that would probably be my first choice.

We played with the basic game, and to be honest, I wasn't terribly impressed. It's a basic area control with a couple of twists (and not terribly good ones, at that) thrown in. Maybe the "Alternate" game would be better, so I'll give it another try, but for now, I'm not impressed.

RATING: 8
This game is just brutal. Even for as short as it is, I still feel satisfied by it. Somewhat uncommon for a "filler" game. 

Q: Cave Troll? Is this some pocket sized version of a dungeon crawl?

A: No. This is an area majority game with a dungeon theme pasted on top. In fact, the original theme was rival groups of archeologists uncovering artifacts in a cave.

Q: There are lots of area majority games out there, is this one worth buying?

A: Yes, IF you like:
Aggressive area majority.
Action point based play mechanics.
Quick play.
A bit of random chance.
Screwing your neighbor, in a quick and brutal fashion.
Fantasy theme, thin but still present.
Simple and well written rules.

The biggest sticking point is players that do not take well to fantasy, for some reason it can just ruin this game.

Fun combination of hand management, piece movement, and area control.  Reminds me a little of Small World, but with more strategy.  Nice quality and bits for the smaller price point.  Despite the Fantasy theme, this is not the stereotype dungeon crawl, like Heroquest or Descent.  Game plays pretty quick with the built in time limit of using up a player's deck, but more interesting and meat than a typical filler.  Protect your heroes, once gone, they're gone! (except Adventurers)  Enjoy!

Second edition. This is a good area control game with a welcome fantasy theme (not very common in the genre). It has a certain degree of luck in the order the cards are drawn, but the game is supposed to be light and takes just the right amount of time. It has beautiful miniatures and nice artwork, too. There are only two problems: the fixed board is too big for less than four players, reducing the competition for rooms in games with two or three, and open scores invite ganging up on the leader.

I am usually up for this one. Although it contains a lot of randomness and can get pretty chaotic with lots of players, it contains some strategic choices (even if they aren't always obvious). The theme fits really well also and the fact that not all the artifacts come up each game means it has pretty good replayability. It's a basically a simple, moderately fun game, but the theme really does wonders for it. Really feels like a dungeon crawl rather than the area-control game it really is mechanically.

Tactical area domination game. Personally, I prefer the variant with a bit more combat, luckily both variants come with cards in the box.

The game doesn't really shine with two players, it does need at least three or better four to be any fun - maybe playing with only half the board would fix it, I haven't tried that. There's definitely too much space for two. With four on the other hand, there's plenty of backstabbing and area nicking and trash talk. Fun little filler.

Fun game, but the actual cave troll itself is pretty disappointing.  It feels more like a Cave In since it just blocks a room off and just sits there on the board.  I guess that "Tom Jolly's Collapsing Ceiling Trap" wouldn't sound as exciting as "Tom Jolly's Cave Troll."

RATING: 7
Nice game that finds you getting lots of choices for actions but the end comes rather quickly. After realizing that the monster pieces are rarely moved it was suggested that maybe there should be one bonus action to move only a monster to mix things up. Well see if this changes things too much. It might raise my rating too.

This is one of those games that I keep in my van and bust out whenever I'm around strangers who don't know what to do with themselves.

Until then I'll keep inflicting it on strangers.  -H7

Fun, under-rated, inexpensive, plenty of miniatures & rich fantasy theme. The board is attractive and the miniatures have good detail.

An area control game with a strong fantasy theme.  The idea is a pretty nifty one, with various pieces that do different things--such as the cave troll which drives people out of a room, the treasure, which doubles the value of a room, the barbarian who counts as two people and so forth.  In practice, it can be a little frustrating not to draw the tiles that you need, since some remain unplayed at the end of the game, but I still enjoy the game.  (1 play)

First played this on March 7th, 2007.  The rules are ok, however it will take a game play to figure out.  The game doesn't take too long either (about an hour).  It's an enjoyable "get-em" game.  I thought that it would be more conflict for spaces on the board.  However I was wrong on two counts.  There turned out to be plenty of room for the pieces (never challenged the 5 player limit) and there was conflit for other reasons.  I'd recommend this as a game play as it does have enough elements that are different enough to stir up a whole new strategy plan.  I (as others I played with) was disappointed when it ended.  It seemed to end too abruptly.

Great area control game, I found it better than Carcassonne but with a similar feel.  The lack of variability with a set map as opposed to the tile drawing and laying definitely appeals to gamers who dislike too much variability.

Initial rating: 6.0

I wasn’t expecting much from the game but I was surprised and I ended having a good time. The game flow very quickly making it a perfect filler to play from time to time. The game components are ok, but the miniature are very pretty, however they can be easily confused for another character in the game. The theme is reminiscent of DungeonQuest, also I felt the game to be very similar to Drakon and Wiz-War to a lesser extent . The rules are very easy to learn. The theme is great, I love that you control a whole party of heroes and, best of all, you also control some monsters, great :D.

I only played with the beginner variant (the triangles) but I really like that the game comes with additional powers for the characters. It has is fair share of luck but I don’t mind as much because you can mitigate it with clever play and the game time is not that long. Each turn you have 4 actions and this creates some interesting decisions within the game. I love the area control aspect. 

I dislike that the game ends immediately leaving some players with less turns than others, that is, the game favors the first players and punish the last players.

Cave Troll surprised me. I want to play again soon. This is a game I would play once a month, perhaps it can go up in my ratings.

Current Rating: 6.0

A gift from the Bully Bear. Fun in the dungeon, rush to the gold and try to hang on! I really like 2-4 player games that can be played quickly like this one and also be action-packed. 
Update: The rating has gone up because repeated plays are addicting. No brain-drain, just chaotic fun.

Fairly light and rather chaotic.  Seems like your fate is pretty much left up to your opponents rather than your own decisions, which I tend to find slightly annoying.  But I don't think this game was meant to be taken all that seriously :)

RATING: 7
Cave Troll is a cleverly designed game with a fun theme. While it isn't an especially deep game, there is more here than meets the eye. Astute use of your figures' abilities and timing your actions precisely provide the strategic meat of the game. I appreciate the inclusion of the variant powers, which adds increased playability. The endgame mechanism brings some suspense as well. This is a fun twist on dungeons and area control.

Found at FLGS collecting dust still in shrink at a small discount. Opened after puchasing and found I was short of one blue orc but there was two extra knights, one blue and one red. Used the blue scoring counter to act as the blue orc and used the blue knight to track scores. Problem solved.

RATING: 8
Really fun game. Only thing I don't like about it is the possibilty of scoring tokens being drawn proximate to each other - which may give a player an unsurmountable lead just based having a superior board position for a "snapshot" of the game.

Update: I am raising my rating to an 8 based on the 2nd edition rules - which fixes the major "snapshot" problem I had with the first edition.  The components have also gotten a nice overhaul in the 2nd edition.

Area control... yawn!  Except that the pieces in this game fight each other... this is a fun and significant twist on the genre. The dungeon theme fits the game very well and motivates the special abilities of some of the pieces. There's room for strategy and lots of interaction on the board, it can get a bit busy with 4 players, which is neither good nor bad.

RATING: 6
I was expecting and wanting an area-majority game, which is what this clearly is under the hood. Cave Troll, like most area-control/area-majority games, probably plays pretty interestingly with 4 and maybe with 3, but the board's too vacant for 2 (unless, I guess, each took two colors) and strategy is pretty low. Perhaps the scale should be readjusted for two (say, three figures to a room and fewer hourglasses needed to trigger a scoring). Components are good for FFG's Silver Line.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Tom Jolly...nuff said. This edition is a little better than the first. Not that it plays better although the layout of the board has more spaces for bringing in the "bad guys". I feel the addition of the minis is not only better for the "toy factor' but it's much easier to see whats on a space rather than to try to sort through all the chits like the original.

RATING: 6
Cave Troll is a yet another euro with cool components that pretends to have a theme. Still, the theme is plausible, even if low, but don't expect it to feel like your typical dungeon crawler.

It's an area majority game. The heroes serve players to claim dominance over the board: whoever has more heroes in a room scores it. Some heroes have special powers which allow players to break the rules in one way or another. For instance, the dwarf gives you more points, while the thief has freedom to move anywhere she wants. Players also control the monsters, which don't count towards dominance but can affect opposing heroes. For instance, the orc kills heroes, removing them from the board.

The main drawback of the game is that luck has quite an impact, as some figures are way better than others. As they are randomly drawn, the player who first gains access to the most powerful pieces will have a clear advantage over the others.

Cave Troll isn't a dungeon crawler, but an area majority game with a fantasy theme. Fun? Yes. Deep? Not much. Falls in the "I rarely suggest to play it but never mind to play" category.

This is a great little game. Mind you I bought it second hand and it is missing a few pieces, but it is still playable as is. It is a bit short, but I really do enjoy it. 

Due to the difficulty of the 2nd Edition of Runebound, our current house rule is to play Cave Troll first. For every ten gold you have claimed by the end of the game, you get 1 additional gold added to your starting total for Runebound. That way we aren't spending all our gold on health all the time.

RATING: 6.6
This game is simple and quick!
For such a short game (45min) there is a lot of strategy, and kill the leader tactics.

Players move around the board trying to secure high valued rooms, by having the most heroes in that room.  But there are monsters that kill heroes, and heroes that kill monsters, and special power cards.

The game also comes with alternate Hero / Monster abilities which switch up the game play nicely.

Fantasy Flight is really good at producing FABULOUS pieces of art work in the form of games... still not sure they know how to make actual games though. This is a chess type game of moving the proper pieces into the proper spaces to get you more points than your opponent. I get irritated by games that put a theme on it, and market it as such but really have little to do with the theme in the game. You could use this same exact play but put a western or scifi theme and it would be the same exact thing. If you love 'fantasy' games, don't get tricked into buying this one for the pretty pictures. If you like nice little games with high player interaction, then this may be for you.

Not really a big fan unless you are playing with 2 players only.  With more than 2 it just seems a bit too chaotic.  My only other issue is that some games can be decided based upon when you get your hero/monster cards. With 2 players it still isn't interesting enough for me to want to play it.

Overrated game IMO.  Sold.

In Cave Troll, each player controls a party of explorers raiding the cave troll’s lair. Using knights, dwarves, thieves, and other adventurers, the players search the lair for gold and magical artifacts. The players must be careful, however, because they aren’t only competing against each other, but against savage orcs, terrifying wraiths, and the fearsome cave troll itself!

Cave Troll is a fast-paced dungeon-crawling board game of strategy, looting, and monster-bashing from Tom Jolly, the creator of Drakon.

This was an impulse buy. I was looking for a dungeon crawl. The box art is pretty and made me wonder how they fit all those cool figurines into such a small box. As it turns out, the figurines are miniscule and the theme is an afterthought. It's a sort of paper/rock/scissors game where each creature has strengths and weaknesses against the other creatures who are vying for control of the board. I've tried to get it onto the table a couple times but no one has had any patience in learning it.

I like this game and is good for a filler.  Not a very long game.  I believe the playing pieces probably need a little work with regard to the mechanics.

RATING: 5
A decent area control game with a nice fantasy theme. THe mechanics are easy enough to teach but there are many little nuances that you must keep track of to be successful.

Seems to lack interesting turns/choices though and as such the game is not quite as fun as I had hoped.

2-4p, 20-60m.  I like Tom Jolly's Drakon(3rd ed.), so I'd like to try another.  This light dungeon crawl is due for re-release in early 2006.

In October 2007, I received the first edition in trade for some Sim City cards.  The first edition punch-out markers aren't quite as nice as the 2nd ed. minis.

Worker placement and area control game.

Pros: small box, great miniatures, quick to play, variant game options, kid-friendly.
Cons: some rules unclear, could take a few games just to work out how to play, works with 2 players, but really needs 3 to 4 players to make it better.

Wonderful theme that has almost nothing to do with the actual game at all. Big ups for it not pasting on a theme about getting the most belt buckles to impress a butler or whatever.

The game itself is really interesting. It's a pretty abstract area control jam, but it's got a lot of screw you moves and to me almost feels in some ways like a really simple 1960 or Twilight Struggle. Keep raising your own influence in areas worth more points while making efforts to kill off the other players dudes. The fixed number of action points per turn leave you always wanting to do a lot more than you can and with a lot of good solid options to choose from.

Plus there is just amazing joy to be found in dropping a cave troll on someones carefully stocked and guarded room and killing lots of their dudes.

Tom Jolly Gem. Plays 2-4. Own the first edition. Fun dungeon crawl style game with limited actions and interesting variably(randomly)timed scoring mechanic. The Cave Troll is a big smelly Dungeon Bomb that takes over what ever room you place him in. More players means more cave trolls which can make for some interesting positional/board situations.

Okay, so it's just a no-frills area control game with a bunch of fantasy trappings.  That's exactly what makes it as enjoyable as it is.  It's a perfect filler or time-killer.

This was one of those games that I played once and then put on the shelf. One of my gripes during play was that multiple tokens have to be stacked within a room. This means you can't tell at a glance which characters are in a given room. You have to pick up and examine the stack of tokens to see who's there.

Yeah, this game is freakin awesome. Gameplay is easy enough to learn, and their is enough strategy to make this lite-game see plenty of plays from me in the future. Mechanics are easy to follow, and who doesnt have fun scavaging through a Cave Troll's lair scroounging for treasure. This game is just plain fun and should be tried for those who like the fantasy-type games. The only part of this game that I didnt enjoy was the randomness you have to your special players....the last card in my deck was the 2xtreasure Dwarf which cost me any real chance of winning the game, but I still had a blast playing anyways. Simple and special

OK components, but not a great game.  Too random.  (Everyone has an identical set of unit cards, but the sequence of the unit's appearance is randomly drawn.)  Rules are not well done (Are your own monsters friendly to your own hero units?)  Plastic units are difficult to tell apart.  I even used a Sharpie to mark initials on them.  They are still so small and similar, that it was tough to see who was who.  Move stuff around and score the rooms on occasion.  Ultimately, it just wasn't very fun or interesting.  I can't imagine playing this with just 2-people.

Reasonable. An interesting hybrid of area majority and orcs, but for me, not especially compelling. And I think there's potential for some very imbalanced games depending on the tile draw. I would play it again if I had like, a 10-year-old with whom I couldn't play something more interesting.

A surprisingly good little tactical game with some random element (card drawing). I played the 1st edition a lot, and the 2nd is even better. The luck factor in the 2nd ed. has been toned down a lot, and the presentation has also improved considerably. Overall, a very enjoyable game - doesn't take much time, a lot of interaction takes place, and the games we have had were mostly very brutal and full of action. I wholeheartedly recommend this, either as a filler, or as a solid tactical / area control game in its own right.

Абстрактно-математичный контроль территорий (area control), к которому непонятно каким боком прилеплена тема исследования подземелий (dungeon crawl). Да ещё эту абстрактность сильно портит случайность прихода карточек, совершенно здесь неуместная.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
An interesting small area-control game.  I find the lack of control due to deck order issues to be somewhat vexing (I seem to have a penchant for drawing bunches and bunches of Adventurers early) and in general solidifying a position seems hard.  The game is short (45 min.?), however, and that excuses a lot; it's also got some nice tactical bits.

I have not played with the variant characters.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Nice roles for the small group of different characters that each player controls.  Scales down VERY well from 4p to 2p or 3p if you simply use common sense in restricting the board appropriately!  Don't overlook this excellent game!!

RATING: 8.5
Finally got a chance to play this.  Fun little game of area control with great theme on top.  Surprised it's not rated higher here on BGG.  Maybe it's to do with the luck factor of the card draw.  But that didn't bother me, and seemed to average out over the course of the game.  Glad I picked this one up.

RATING: 6
I must be the only one who prefers the first edition. Other than the randomness of when scoring comes up, I think it's superior to the 2015 version due to the minis being difficult to tell apart once they're out on the board. Anyways...

Cave Troll is an enjoyable area control game, but not one that has a lot of depth to it. There's room for creative play, and the variant heroes are a nice touch in this edition, but I'm finding that I prefer meatier area control games these days. If I want to play a filler, I'm more likely to reach for a small card game like Coloretto or Parade over this. This is fine for what it is, but I wish that there was just a little more to it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Cool little area control filler game with a dungeon-crawling theme. The appearance of the game reminds me of the days when I used to play the original Diablo. The game play itself is quite good, although it can be a bit random with scoring instances and when trolls show up. Overall a great little game.

This game is an interesting combination of luck and strategy. The randomness of the card draw can greatly affect what a player can do on their turn and drawing certain cards early in the game or other card late in the game can either make or break a players chances to win. It is definitely a game that requires multiple plays in order to hone in on good (if not winning) strategy.

On a dungeon with 4 entrances, lie gold ranging from 1 VP to 5 VP. Players have various characters, which are shuffled into a stack. Players can draw from their stack to put characters into play, move characters or trigger special actions of their characters. When a player draws their "score" token, a scoring round takes place, where one has to have a majority of characters to earn the gold in a particular room. It's fun and light. Only played once.

RATING: 7.9
This game has a lot in common with both Beowulf games. The similarities are that it:

-Has a theme that's MOSTLY painted on and it would be easy enough to have the theme altered but keep mechanics the same (theme works for mechanics rather than a true theme game like War of the Ring where mechanics work for theme)

-Has high quality components and pieces typical of Fantasy Flight

-Has simple and elegant rules and gameplay; easy to set up and explain but life time to master with layers of different strategies and adaptations possible

-Is fast-paced, fun, has good replay-ability and I definitely recommend and think is underrated. Easy to play in under 40 minutes which makes it good for a week-night on the coffee table.

-Has low levels of luck and high levels of skill (though still nowhere near a deterministic game)
--------------------------
I recommend this game as a real winner which uses area of control in refreshing and interesting mechanics. Fun game if you give it a chance.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's like a simpler version of Small World.  I think that's a point in its favor, since you can concentrate on the fun area of control stuff instead of worrying about resource management.  It feels weird that the adventurers just squat in the cave rather than doing any adventuring, though.

This is another game (like Too Many Cooks) that will greatly benefit from having 4 experienced players involved. I think the luck of the draw is a little over-stated by some.

Very simple and plays quickly. Send your heroes into the dungeon to control the valuable rooms, while you use your monsters to stop other players from doing the same.

At first glance, it's all about doing the best with the two cards you have on hand, but the game is surprisinly deep. Perhaps a tad random though.

Best with 4 players I guess, though simply covering parts of the board could fix that.
Lots of value for your money with this one.

Too random, you have very few options each round because you choose 1 of 2 cards. No long term planning, the goal is to get the max out of them.

The core of the game is area majority, which is scored three times during the game. I have seen this in quite a few games, but in this one there's almost nothing else.

The big issue for me is that besides being an area majority game, the confrontation is encouraged: you are completely at the mercy of your opponents. This, as always, is very fine for 2 players, but with more, the more peaceful guy is likely to win.

It would be OK for a 20-30 minutes game. But our games where nowhere close to that.

2nd edition (3d minis)

RATING: 7
Nice filler for 2-4 players. Random cards prevent deeper strategy, but this is very enjoyable "dungeon adventure" with strong area control mechanic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
An area majority game for the most part, getting your core adventurers out to the rooms offering the most points, er, gold. It's spiced up by the arrival of your special heroes - one of which doubles points, one which counts for 2 adventurers, etc - and your ability to land and move monsters to whack other people. Getting the best advantage out of these dudes provides the interest. You use your 4 action points each turn to draw a card and introduce its dude to the board, or move your guys already out there to better scoring rooms. It's fast, and not bad. It's just that fixed area majority and its associated kingmaking paradigm doesn't do a lot for me as a genre this far into my gaming career.

Cave Troll is alright, man.  Woe betide the person who draws Cave Troll too early, though, or who draws Paladin too late.  

There are times when a player is highly motivated *not* to draw tiles for an action, and the game can get very, very slow when that happens.

Nonetheless, I've more or less enjoyed it every time I've played.

Nice components by the way.

I usually like area control games, but this one features a lot of luck in the order your tiles come out.  The threat of the Cave Troll makes you not want to concentrate in any room too much.  Scoring throughout the game provides plenty of bash-the-leader opportunities.  This game is okay, but not great.

I'm tempted to rate this higher, because with the right group this is a great 'screw-you' area control game.  However, I don't see it playing super well with anything other than 4 players, so that is a little limiting.  

The variable abilities of the the different figures add great variety, but they are not overly complicated.  The artifact abilities are helpful and special, but not overwhelming as they come up rarely.  Overall the game is fast, elegant and raucous as people try to ruin eachother's plans, but the 'screwage' is so well built into the game, that you can't feel bad about it for long whether giving or receiving.

It's a fine area control game. Like any other area control game, don't play it with an odd number of players. Play with 2, or play with 4. I am always hoping for that simple issue to be finally addressed in an AC game, but it just isn't here. Otherwise, I like the theme.

RATING: 5
The random scoring intervals were very painful when combined with the random opportunities players have for getting an edge through a good draw.  There's a real advantage, too, for the one person  tedious enough to keep score at every moment.  The interaction between special character types was all that really interested me.  Perhaps a good game for kids.

RATING: 6.5
Don't be fooled by the fantasy theme. This is first and foremost an area control game, where the theme does kind of fit a bit on it, but it will really not feel like you are fighting. We liked it, but I am sure this was a bit more of a bit burner than we had imagined, and it requires some planning and risking to be able to succeed. Despite this, I would probably think that most people that would enjoy an area control game would like this. It is a step harder than, lets say, Smallworld, and I think it is more on the thinking side than on the fun side. I am sure we will play it plenty, but I will have to see on that.

So it was about a month ago, maybe more, that I was at a local store and was looking specifically for a game that was 1) fast  2) full of good production  3) great for 2 players.  So I picked up 'Cave Troll' - 2nd edition (the one with the minis).  

For those of you who don't know this game and may read my comments on it, Cave Troll is a game featuring a static board of a dungeon, which is comprised of about 25 different 'rooms'.  In addition, there are about 3 spawn points for both monsters and adventurers.  Each player controls a small horde of minis, ranging from lowly adventurers, to the barbarian, to the thief, but each player will also control monsters - an orc, a wraith, and of course - their very own Cave Troll.

The basic mechanics here are - players have a card, draw a card, then play a card.  Each card determines what character they can activate and bring on to the board.  Players have 'actions' that they can use to move their figures around the board, trying to gain areas of control over the sections of the dungeon that house the most gold.  At the end of the game, the person who has acquired the most gold wins.

Simple enough.  Good production, it does play fast, but my only real problem here is the card draw - and the fact that players are limited in the creatures that they can play based on when the card is drawn.  Some players don't seem to mind -- myself, I think it's a crutch.  It can be rationalized away, I suppose (make due with what you have because you can still win) but the whole idea feels inherently flawed.  A good alternative would be to somehow let players bring any figure on the board at any time, but the actions points used to do so would vary dependant on the figure played.  For now, I'll give this a 7 - because I think there are some good things in there, but I may just have to keep looking for a better alternative if my original goal is the same.

1 partial play - 4 players - 30 min til we stopped

The minifigs are not uniformly distributed -- some colors had different mixes of figures. The cards didn't help differentiate the heros and adventurers so chaos ensued and the game ground to a halt. We tried labeling the figure bases based on the type of figure but we couldn't get the distribution straight and finally gave up.

Cave Troll is a good old fashion family Euro game dressed up in Fantasy Flight clothing.  It's area control.  Players play Heroes on the board.  If you have more Heroes on a space you get the points during scoring.

Some Heroes have special powers.  There are also monsters that players can place on the board.  The monsters allow players to hurt each others' Heroes directly with the ultimate spoiler being the Cave Troll himself.

There's nothing particularly novel here but the game's great at what it does.

Cave Troll is a fantasy themed area-control game NOTt a "fast-paced dungeon-crawling board game of strategy, looting, and monster-bashing.." as the blurb would tell you.  It's a nice game for what it is, with nice figures, but more in the vein of Dungeon Twister.

Fun tug-of-war type game. Have to be clever to hold on to the lead in this game. The random card draws add quite a bit of luck to the game, but we've noticed it doesn't unbalance it too much since the card you get is really only as good as how you choose to use it. Each piece has a purpose. For some of us, this is our go to filler game.

This game wasn't quite what I was expecting, but it turned out to be a lot of fun. This weird fantasy area-control game requires a lot of thought each turn, since you're never certain when a scoring round will happen. There are a lot of interesting decisions to make about whether you try to flood the board with adventurers or spend your time moving them (or your monsters!) to better locations.

For some reason I've always been hesitant to introduce this game to people, and I really shouldn't be. It's actually pretty easy to teach, and it doesn't take long for people to get into it. The complexity is really in the strategy, and deciding where best to put your heroes. There are even variant rules for those heroes that drastically change how you use them, providing a fresh take on this already intriguing game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Very interesting free-form game of positional strategy and very few tactical concerns. All decisions are long-term, which is very unusual for any game, let alone one this compact. There's a strong luck factor in what order the tokens are drawn, but that concern is easily houseruled into oblivion. Sold 08.01.07.

I'd toss it at the rabid preteen boys seeking vengence group. We had two brothers, who were always at each other, play this game. They probably already played Magic, so grokked the rules rather quickly. However, rather than focus on area control, they dug the monsters and did all sorts of brotherly infighting. That orc must have taken six actions in a row.

There's a lot I liked in this game, but overall it felt a little too chaotic at 4 players and too spread-out at less than 4.

8.23.14 - (1 play) I avoided playing this game for many years but it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I'm guessing that my one play didn't reveal the depth to the game. Like Drakon and Wiz-War better, though I'd play this again.

Played at KublaCon 2007. Without knowing anything about it I figured this would not be my type of game so I hadn't tried it yet. Talking to Tom Jolly though it sounded like something I would like, so I seeked it out to try it. It was not bad, though I don't see playing it too often.

Dungeon crawl meets chess...well kinda? A hidden gem where each player blindly selects tokens (from their pool) that contain adventurers, monsters, artifacts, etc. Each having unique abilities or special effects which allow them to move around the dungeon to try to collect gold or to punish their opponents. 1st Edition components are okay but are  hard to distinguish between opponents however the game play is what you're after with this one. I may end up purchasing the 2nd edition with the miniatures and cards since it looks like it would enhance the experience?

A fairly light area control game.  A good mixture of luck and skill, with a dose of "screw your opponent" tossed in.  Plays OK with 2, very chaotic with 4.  I am guessing that the general consensus I've seen is that 3 is the ideal number, though 2 and 4 is still enjoyable.

RATING: 6.5
A light "dungeon crawl" game, actually more of an "area control" game than anything else.  The randomness of the token draw is annoying at times, especially when one or two "tally the room" tokens are selected very early in the game.  Another quibble is the "monsters in the pit," where orcs tend to hang out in the pit so as not to be taken out by knights.  This tends to result in a stalemate situation in some cases.<BR><BR>The bits and the board are fairly nice (even though the box liner does not seem to be made for this game at all.)  Gameplay can be thought provoking and the game is priced very inexpensively for a boardgame.

RATING: 4.5
When I first played this with two I was unimpressed and confused at its existence.  It is an uninteresting area control game that relies on its crappy fantasy theme to make up for the fact that it all comes down to the order of some lucky draws. 

I ended up giving it another chance with three and found that while some lucky draws did swing the game a bit, there were some fun decisions to make and there actually was a game there.  Still, there needs to be severe rule tweaks.  The artifacts are completely unbalanced, the seal should only score once at the end of the game otherwise it is an automatic 15 points (or more with more players) if you draw this early.  Then there is the artifact that lets you scatter your guys, this is way too powerful, if you get it near the beginning of the game you just stack your guys at the entrance and then use it to pop them around on every free space on the board.  Absurd.  This should just allow you to teleport to any other space.  Giving three points to the guy that didn't use their artifact is fine, but if you don't draw your artifact you get nothing, frankly, this is stupid.  

There is just too much luck in this game, and I'm not sure it is possible to catch the leader.  The Orcs are the only balance, but if you can't get them out soon enough they will be penned in.  

Underneath there is a decent game here, but I think it may be a little too random for the gaming decisions that it requires you to make.  Nonetheless, it is a more playable version of Tikal, certainly quicker. I rate this a 3 with two players.

This game is a blast.  It feels like chess, but with land grab/control, and your own personal deck.  It's a thrill to draw cards to see what you get next.

Though the "luck" factor of the random-card-drawing feature may seem out of place for a strategy game, I feel that this system did not take away from the game, but rather added to it.  It forces you to adapt and react to what tools you have available, rather than simply getting all of your best units out each time you play, or rather than developing a single strategy that you use each and every time.

*edit* Cave Troll was even more fun with 4 people than it was with 3.  For that it earns another half a point.

Quite a fun little game that seems perfect for closing out the night.  

The gameplay is very evocative of the theme, despite it originally being designed/intended as an archeology game.  Just knowing a CAVE TROLL(!) might be lurking in those tunnels is enough to set me on edge!

I suck at this game so far, but it's fun!  Rating may go up with more plays... don't suspect it'll drop much if at all.

My partner and her friend, Kerstin, refer to this game simply as "TROLLS!"

Having loved Dungeonquest and Heroquest I expected a lot from this game and it met my expectations. My version is the first edition so there are no plastic models - this is good because in the new edition it can be confusing as to what is what. The game is short, and very enjoyable with 2-4 players. The game is ideal as a filler or for entry level gamers.

RATING: 7
Each player tries to score points by placing and moving their heroes into rooms of a dungeon.  Only players who control a room will score points.  To control a room, he must have the most (and not tied for the most) characters in a room.

Players, on their turn may play a card (which is the only way to place a character in the dungeon.  Players may also move a character one space, activate a special power on a character or activate an artifact.

Scoring occurs when a number of cards have been played when the total number of hour glass symbols reaches or exceeds 5.  There are also some special cards that can score points as well.  Scoring also occurs when any player runs out of cards in his draw deck.  In this case, the game also ends.

Some of the characters have special abilities to help you.  Some of the character are monsters which you can use to hinder your opponents.

really good game, dense without being long. both the standard rules and the alternative characters offer interesting gameplay, and the character powers and minis suceed in adding a "dungeon feel" to what is, in fact, a well-design El-Grande-like area control. works well with 2 (which is not common to area-control games), 3 and 4. could DT be the fine balance between euro design and ameritrash-like theme? i don't know, but i say: gotta try this! :]

After the first play I remarked "That is the most balanced game I have ever played". The different heroes and monsters have a good balance, but since that first game I have noticed a few fatal flaws. Firstly, the wraith is near useless as it can't push knights. Which brings me to my next point- knights are a little too powerful. Lastly, the 'score a room cards' can be very hit or miss. I haven't used the advanced heroes and monsters but I'm sure they would just further disrupt the balance.

[thing=4491][/thing] feels more like and strategy euro game than a dungeon crawler - positioning and the use of the right monster/hero can count more than bashing creatures. It is, also, an area control game, since, in the end, you will get points (gold) for the areas you control.

The actions are pretty simple, and you can do four of them, in any order, and even repeat actions. They are: take a card and play a card; move a hero or a monster; play an Artefact card; use an ability of a hero or a monster.

Basically, you use your heroes against the other players monsters (and also, your monsters against other players heroes).

[thing=4491][/thing] is a smart and well done game, but it failed, with me, in being engaging and as fun as I thought it would be once I saw the cover and title. It can be a tense game, decided in the last moves and uses of abilities, though. But, for this one, I wanted more a sort of a Descent free-for-all than an El Grande with different units and abilities.

It is, indeed, a better game if you play with 3 or 4.

In Cave Troll, each player controls a party of explorers raiding the cave troll’s lair. Using knights, dwarves, thieves, and other adventurers, the players search the lair for gold and magical artifacts. The players must be careful, however, because they aren’t only competing against each other, but against savage orcs, terrifying wraiths, and the fearsome cave troll itself!

Because of its streamlined rules, the second edition of this game plays quite a bit better than the first. I especially like the way the hourglass icons on some of the adventurer cards determine when a scoring round takes place. In addition, the small scale miniatures look really nice on the board (much better than the cardboard chits of the first edition). That said, the winner of the game (which really should only be played with four) is always going to be the one who is left alone the most by his competitors. Not necessarily the one who plays best tactically.

I think this is a really clever little game but my partner dislikes 'bish, bash, bosh' (as all confrontational games are called in our house).
Thankfully it's short enough to still get played!

I really enjoy this game, I'm always happy to play it.  It's fairly quick, has some interesting strategies, and just enough randomness (although one game I had a play all set up for several rounds waiting for a specific card, which turned out to be the last card in my deck, ouch)

I think this is underrated - perhaps by people expecting a dungeon crawl, whereas it's actually a majorities game requiring some amount of thought.  There is significant luck of the draw, but this is mitigated by the ability to draw multiple times in your turn, and the usually large number of useful options for placement.  I've only played the original version, not the Deluxe one.

RATING: 6
Nothing particularly spectacular, but a well-done example of its genre.  The plastic miniatures are fantastic, and really make the game feel much more thematic and interesting.  This is a short, chaotic game, that revolves around triggering scoring when it is best for you.  There's some depth to it, certainly more than the take-that art on the box suggests.  I wouldn't play this often, and I'm certainly not going to buy it, but I will say that it's better than I expected it to be.  It's not a particularly strategic game, but there is tactics and interesting decisions.  Turns are perfect length.  More actions would make the game drag, less would make you feel like you don't get to do anything on your turn.  This is a well-engineered, well-playtested iteration of its genre.  Good choice for folks who love dungeon crawlers and want something that plays four in less than an hour.

RATING: 7
It's a nice little game.  Not a huge strategic investment, but then it's not a very long game either, which works in its favor.  I'm probably going to buy myself a copy sooner or later.  Definitely 2nd edition though as I'd much, much rather have all those great little plastic figures rather than cardboard disks.

In Cave Troll, each player controls a party of explorers raiding the cave troll’s lair. Using knights, dwarves, thieves, and other adventurers, the players search the lair for gold and magical artifacts. The players must be careful, however, because they aren’t only competing against each other, but against savage orcs, terrifying wraiths, and the fearsome cave troll itself! Cave Troll is a fast-paced dungeon-crawling board game of strategy, looting, and monster-bashing from Tom Jolly, the creator of Drakon. Cave Troll is playable in 20-60 minutes for two to four players, Ages 10 and up. No dice! Also known as Jaskinia Trolla.

You can really see that this game started off as an exploration game, and then got re-themed when FFG got a hold of it.  It suffers by appearing to be a dungeon crawl sort of game, when in fact it's more a game that would appeal to standard Euro-game players.  The people who buy it aren't really its target audience, and its target audience aren't going to get past the theme to realize it's their sort of game.  That being said, though, the game is random and chaotic, and prone to severe downtime, so maybe the Euro folks should avoid it anyway.

We really like this game. Great... yes, great MINIATURES, I even use for my dungeoneer games, very good design of the MAP and CARDS and easy rules. This game is a very strategic one eventhough it is easy to learn and provided us with a lot of fun for those days we are not in the mood of 200 components over the table (people get hungry during the games and they know if a bubble of their pepsi floats near a board things are going to get nasty). For the small box: THANKS FFG !!!

Not really my kinda game. I generally don't appreciate games that bother to have a theme, but then do not proceed to hold that theme up with the rules. In my Priority List of what I value in games, Theme will always come in Before Rules, and if the Rules do not support the theme... well you see :)

However I just learned the game was originally themed as an Archeology game, and well, this makes complete sense to me now. I wish they had kept it as such, because the rules uphold that theme, but they don't uphold a dungeon crawl theme.

I wanted a game with a light dungeon crawl, and came across Cave Troll.

Although the game is set within a dungeon, it really isn't a dungeon crawl whatsoever, but rather a treasure hunt.  The game is still rather fun and was a pleasant surprise!

The game play is pretty enjoyable and not too complex, which is what I was looking for despite the difference in mechanics.  I really like the fact that there exists two different gaming variations from which to choose.  Both are excellent and add their own unique touch.

The game components are top-notch as expected from FFG.  The plastic miniatures are very nicely detailed and high-quality.  The cards are just as nice as those included in FFG's other releases - featuring attractive artwork and very durable.

The game board has to be my favorite as it is so detailed for its size.  The dungeon depicted is one-of-a-kind.

My only complaint concerns game play which can be rather redundant, and I have noticed sessions either play out too fast or too slow... it would be nice to see an expansion which smooths this out.

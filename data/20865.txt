After just a turn or two the no-dice movement starts to make sense and the subtleties start to come out. it lacks a bit of the excitement of the 'push your luck' racing games as you tear way too fast into a corner, but i'm looking forward to playing it again and seeing how it shakes out over the long haul.

RATING: 7
A fun racing game.  The racing has a vector or momentum/inertia aspect to it.  Your movement on the current turn directly impacts your movement choices for the next, immediately following turn, leading to a real feeling of progression and movement.  This couples well with a line-of-sight requirement to generate strategic opportunities via planning and movement.

For example, it behooves a racer to follow an out-in-out line on the corners, and slow down accordingly, in order to maximize subsequent acceleration.  A lot of the movement ends up mimicking the movement and momentum you would anticipate from a real racing experience.

Negatives for me are game length and die-rolling (d12) for some outcomes (e.g., crashes, sudden brakes beyond the allotment, extra acceleration).  While I appreciate the need for multiple outcomes, and the die works well in that regard, some of the results are absolutely crippling and I just cannot get behind that.  Probably slightly more realistic and much more cautionary for it, but I don't like a racing game where a bad roll = utter failure and loss.

I suspect I'm not a great fan of racing games, else I would rate this one higher than a 7.  But this is very well done and worth playing.  I strongly recommend trying this, particularly if you like racing games.

This is an excellent race game that does not depend on luck.  Game play is based on inertia and requires planning and smart use of the heavy breaking option.  Game plays best if players remember that it is a race and don't get lost in analysis of the move.  The game includes a timer which should be used only if the play is slow.  The game play is sufficiently strategic that a player can control 2 cars and attempt to use blocking to ensure their team wins.  The track length is short enough that 2 laps can be finished in a reasonable amount of time.  The game is on par in quality and fun to Fomrula De and a great alternative with a completely different mechanism for racing.  For fans of racing, this is an outstanding game to add to a collection.

A no luck vector based frictionless race game. Similar to what a race with rocket ships would be like.  You do have to visualize a couple of moves ahead which can be difficult for some.

Fun but your first game is definitely a learning game.  You do need 2 laps for all those sharp brakers that wear out their tires on the first lap.

Great race game. First few games will be slow, but once every one understands the mechanics, it moves fast. Feels like a slingshot as you shoot your car toward your pawn, then set the pawn for the next turn. Minimal dice, even with the advanced rules, which is the only way to play.

Honestly, I expected more from this. The base mechanic, the graphing/vector plotting, is super fun and highly analytical. However, the game adds a bunch of extra fiddly stuff (crash rules, random start rules, car set ups) that, IMO, bring it down. Of course, you can just skip all of that stuff.

RATING: 6
How can a game that is all about capturing the thrill of speed be so slooooowwww? We've only played the basic game so far, and in fairness it is obvious that it wants to be played with all the rules tacked on. Saying that, a quick glimpse tells me it will be tackling one of my gripes up to a point, but pro-rules won't make it any faster, and that alone will keep me from pulling it out in a hurry. I always felt Formula De was pushing it a bit, but forgiving comes easy as it sure is fun. Here, to me, the lack of speed is more the fast track to losing the will to live.

It's rare when a game comes unstuck because it uses its clever mechanism too well. There is one flaw in designing a realistic diceless racing game that takes velocity into account and has next to no modifiers to push the car: there still is an optimum line around the track that is open to the race leader. This game is all about the (tight) corners. Making sure you emerge at the best angle with the highest speed in the new direction. Any extra forward space onto the new straight that you squeeze out of your curving will benefit you for 2 or 3 turns if the straight is long enough. Realistic maybe, but only fun and game worthy if a driver isn't 100% guaranteed to complete its optimum move.

With enough distance between drivers, catching up or overtaking is impossible, as a driver can just stick to the best route (a puzzle which is nearly solvable if it wasn't for brake rules). So the moment a driver gets away from the pack by enough spaces, only serious risk-taking will bring him back, as there is nothing between the leader and the finish line that will prevent perfect moves all the way through.

All this game is about is how lucky followers are after driving into a corner at breakneck speed during their catch-up attempts. There is no real alternative way to overtake that won't put your car out of action. Curiously, when one driver does take insane risks and tries to bridge this gap, slipstreamers benefit even more, as they can follow the car in front  to the same distance of 8, without taking any of the risks that comes from pushing a car beyond the 7th gear. Interestingly, they will also approach a corner with one less forwards motion than the person trying to bridge the gap, which frequently is a big plus.

Only when someone decides to force cars into close contact does the opportunity arise to make serious changes on the leader board. Especially as two drivers, side by side on the edge of a corner, are not in a position to block other drivers from slicing between them at improbable angles, even if logical observation suggests that the space between them would dissuade both Starsky and Hutch from tipping the car onto the two wheels and going for it.  

The theory sounds great: diceless vector racing. In Bolide it is turned into a prolongued maths exercise that is overtaken by boredom before the end of lap one. It does need more variables, and tire and fuel choices before the race seem to introduce that in the advanced game. Have I got the will to live through another two laps to find out if that is enough to put the excitement back in, if I know the race will be as "fast"? Or do the advanced rules simply turn it into a different near-solvable maths problem with a clear optimum choice?

Small niggles: the vector markers don't stack well on cars, even though they frequently need to. Some edge lines on corners could be better drawn to make the same possibilities a lot less ambiguous, even after using the ruler. Giving players a 30 sec sand timer for their turn is an interesting idea, but letting everyone share one 30 seconds timer is a problem. How do you turn it over for another 30 secs without waiting for all the sand to run through? 

There is a download version for Formula De that cuts racing time down from an hour and a half to 15 or 10 minutes. If someone would come up with something similar for Bolide could be a stonking race game. Right now it is indeed a competitive exercise for surveyors to work their way around a circuit twice, trying to set up their measuring kit as little as possible. Shame.

RATING: 7.5
Great formula one racing game which uses vector movement. Can be a real challenge to steer your car effectively around the track. Besides the vector movement there are some push your luck elements which liven up the game. The optional advanced rules take the game from a fairly simple racing game to a formula one simulation. Each track has to be analyzed to choose the most effective setup for the car. And than the weather can destroy the best made plans. Great stuff!

To steer clear of analysis paralysis and to keep the playing time managable, I highly recommended to use the provided timer. This will almost certainly lead to mistakes made under time pressure. These mistakes make for the greatest stories and ensure an immersive game experience. Only problem I have with the game is that the long playing time keeps it from hitting the table as often as I would want to.

I "get" the game, so I'm inclined to like it. It's very hard for new players to learn, though. Elegant once you understand, but unintuitive before that.

It's tough to recommend. Because it's perfect-information, and no randomness save for challenging for a spot, when a good player jumps in front is literally impossible to catch them. And racing even just one lap takes a looooooong time. Both of these are cardinal sins for a racing game to have.

But it's rated highly because I'm good at it. :)

This is a very good racing game, unfortunately, it simulates real life a little too much.  Once the leaders establish their positions, it is very, very difficult to pass them.  Furthermore, unless you are near the front, you might as well resign winning the game, and shoot for a better placement.

RATING: 3
After one play: Fun, playable Formula One racing game. This game uses a vector-based movement and acceleration/deceleration system making movement an excercise in judging the correct trajectories for your cars to handle corners and straightaways. And when to wear brakes and tires--no dice involved in these decisions. At the start; whenever you want to boost your engine; or make a pass through the point occuppied by an opponent: out come the dice. And the throws are even at best for the "attacker", so make sure your position is a bit desperate if you want to make that critical pass play. Pit rules seemed confusing on the first read, and we didn't pit in our game. And the leaders tend to stay in front once they break away from the pack. Formule De has a noticeable edge on presentation and excitement, but I think it boils down to the style of race game you wish to play.

Its a no-luck vector racing game. Its positive in that it more closely models the physics of racing than many games. Also, you don't have a bad dice roll to blame for a crash into the wall.

The biggest negative that I see is that the game is neutered of any big moments of excitement. There are no collisions. There are no surprise outcomes. You can see what's going to happen well in advance. There is an optimal path around each corner, and you either take it our you don't. 

So what you're left with is a processional racing game that simple winds to an end, rather than an exciting checkered flag. Its well designed and the production is good enough quality, but I just feel like something is lacking. I'd still be willing to play, but I want more "fun" in my racing games.

Bolide does what other racing games have tried to do - it actually models the physics of race cars in a convincing fashion, with a minimum of rules.  It isn't just a game (and it's a very good game) - it's also a lesson in handling a vehicle capable of high speeds.  It would be even better, if there were real-world, F1 tracks available for it, and if there were a way to shave the playing time down, per lap that you run.

The movement system seems to be very closely related to an old pencil and paper car race game that's been around quite a while.  I can't recall where I first saw it ("Race Track" by Martin Gardner, I think) , but the players drew a track on graph paper (much like the tracks which come with this game) and move their cars using relaistic vectors governing speed and direction.  The game substitutes a pawn and car for the pencil marks, but the system seems the same.

I expect that players who've got the hang of it should be able to finish a lap in under 30 minutes.  I agree that 2.5 hours  would be too long for this one.

Race game where players compete to be first across the line.  Interesting dice-less mechanics, where a car's inertia is recorded from turn to turn and preserved for the following turn.

A mechanic in search of a game.  The momentum system and the way you move your car is really very cool. Unfortunately, since there is practically no luck in the game, it makes it very difficult to catch up once you are behind.  Also, as a racing game you want to have more players, but more players with this one clunks up the board a little bit more desired and stretches the game beyond its welcome.  It's too bad the game isn't as enjoyable as the mechanic is cool.

Clever and innovative approach to auto racing.  Unfortunately, the game bogs down as players spend time trying to figure out their moves, and the game loses its auto racing feel as it devolves into an exercise of manipulating geometric vectors.  And if you fall behind, you can forget about catching up, unless your opponents happen to make bonehead errors.  Yes, this is also true of actual auto racing, but that doesn't mean it makes for a very fun board game.

An interesting attempts at bringing this old vector system up to date with the innovative use of the pawn to track velocity(or momentum). It pretty much eliminates the need for book or record keeping.
 The game still requires a a bit of analysis to wrap you mind around completely (usually a lap or so) before things start to click properly and strategies appear. It is still a luck-less system, but the designers threw a couple of items to add a bit of randomness, variety and interest to the race. Though I am not completely sold on the idea of rolling a chart a few times a game. I think this may leave a bit too much up to lady luck. 
 The tracks are interesting, but the graphics are just to bland. And the dark black graph lines really detract from the aesthetic as well as making everything a bit too busy -and for some- difficult in picturing the valid moves around the pawn.  I would have preferred only the intersects be visible and not the entire lines.  
 
   A 2 lap race can be a little long with more than a couple of players. And woah to the racer whom starts in last place. Still an interesting concept. And a decently fun racing game.  

My score may change after a few more plays and refinements. But I think the streamlined mechanics are really good it's just the lack luster and somewhat abstract appearance of the game hurts it the most.

I played this with two of my regular gaming buddies and they hated it.  It's all about plotted movement and they found it incredibly dry.  I didn't think it was that bad, but I can't see it hitting the table again after that initial reaction.

Can be a little slow and fiddly, but towards the end of the first lap people start to 'get' the vector-based movement and moves go faster.  THe last corner with lots of engagements/pilups was particularly fraught!  Not sure it captivates me enough.

I liked this game alot.  However, it is very different in its mechanic and some people just can't understand this game.  And other people understand it but do not appreciate the mechanic.  This game is Vector Racing on a really good looking board and with a rules modification.  The player can use limited extra braking to slow his car more than the vector would allow. The instructions are written by a person whose native language is Italian and he learned UK English.  The instructions are not as bad as some reviews state.  You just need to think about the meanings of some of the words.  The author often uses words that are not incorrect but are not the most common words that native US English speakers would choose.  Play it with someone who has figured it out before you buy it.

It's a racing game with an interesting vector-based solution to how your car moves. The idea of a racing game with almost no luck was very appealing to me, but in reality I found it to be too slow and pondersome to be very exciting. Since you can calculate the best path through every curve I suspect the tracks are lacking in replayability.

The English rules for this game SUCK! They are in dire need of a rewrite.

After a couple plays, I like it. The inevitable comparison between this and Formula De comes down to....there is no comparison. 

Q: If they are both formula racing games why can't they be compared?

A: That was a figure of speech, any two things can be compared. 
While they do have a common theme, they each focus on vastly different aspects.
Formula De is all about risk management with streamlined rules to keep the race moving.
Bolide has a simulation like feel that takes a lap or two to get a handle on. The mechanic used to accomplish this is not "new" or difficult, however, it will really bog down if players are prone to AP.

Q: Is this a good race game?

A: Yes. However, there are several personal taste issues that determine this. It suffices to say that players would need to like a somewhat long simulation oriented game of formula racing to enjoy this one.

(I think I will try and play this with fewer people, with multiple cars under each players control. Then average out the placement as if the player was in control of a team.)

Wow, what a great racing game.  No dice for movement seemed odd at first, but it translates great into motor racing.  It seems to simulate what the car is doing, not what the driver is doing, eg. it makes no difference what gear you are in based on your driving style, rather how is the car reacting to whatever the driver is doing?  You need to plan ahead, and if you mess up you can't blame the dice!  Also, the rules for weather and setups are clean and blend perfectly with the rest of the game.  This is one I think even my wife would play!  Very well done.

The vector mechanic is relatively easy to use, and may be somewhat difficult to visualize for the first few games, but it works well!  No more looking for dice or counting how many squares you need to move to make it into the curve.  Luck factor has been eliminated.I did notice a few problems though.  First, it can take over an hour to go around the track once, especially with more players.Second, the 'breaking' rule is absurd.  A player can pass everyone else at FULL speed (7 in our game) entering a hairpin turn (!?), apply the breaks, and be out of the curve the next turn.  For the rest of the players who slowed down, it will take them three turns to negotiate the turn...  Dropped the rating to 4.

RATING: 7
I'm a bit torn on this, because I feel like it does what it does extremely well. The movement is simple enough yet really seems to simulate a race. Figuring out how to take the corners without flying off the track is fun. Coasting on someone's rear and then slipstreaming around to take the lead is a real thrill, and the rules for such maneuvers are simple enough. But the downsides are considerable: the game is pretty long and players can be eliminated, or just left in the dust with no chance of catching up. So, I enjoyed it, but I guess something like this would be a niche "event" game for me. I'd happily play it more, but maybe every six months or so. (1 play)

It's a revolutionary and brilliant little system.  I'm not sure if it's actually FUN.  I'd love to see the car movement system grafted onto a Car Wars-like game.  Put those cars in the middle of a big arena, arm them with guns, and let loose.  The car movement rules were always the big problem with Car Wars.  I think Bolide has solved them, perhaps?

This game is interesting, but too long.  It is also a game of errors.  If the person in the lead makes no mistakes, it is impossible to catch up.  I think the addition of brakes, boosting, etc, helps the solvability problem, but I found it more entertaining to play the public domain version of racetrack.

Excellent system and concept.  VERY VERY Long.  Too Long.  Must use the timer...probably should be 1/2 as long (like 30 seconds for you to move, there's little reason for you to not know what you are going to do when your turn comes)

This loses 2 points due to extreme time length.

Doubt I'd play again as it took almost 1 hour for 3 people to do one lap.  God help us if we had 4-5 people doing 2-3 laps...6 hours?  Probably

One of my favorites. It has a nice feeling of real racing. Of course there's an optimal route for every track (which I haven't found out yet) but other players will most of the time force you to do something a bit differently. Advanced rules will probably make the game a bit different.

Cool concept lifted from an old pencil & paper game, not as good game as it could be though. What really hurts the game is that Bolide has an uncomfortable balance between luck & skill - either the game is purely calculable and the player coming out first from the first corner wins every time, or you add the luck element in which means you can lose a two hour long game due to a single die roll.

For similar (vector movement but with dice) experience I'd recommend Powerboats.

Just one play so far ... the vectormechanic is very fascinating, but the incredibly random die-rolling seems way off the mark, in an otherwise highly controllable game.

We had innummerable rules issues as well, but maybe we can solve those with a faq or better translated rules.

And why on earth, has the graphic designer not made sure, that the points are either fully on the course, or fully off the course? It is the most anoying and futile argument to have during play, and it could have been prevented so easily.

Only played one intro game. This is a good race game, we didnt have allt he rules down but wanted to get the movement system under control. this took a few turns but everyone had it about 1/2 way around the 1st lap. The rules for blocking and for bumping (anything that uses the charts) are needed to keep this game fun. With out them it is too easy to see who is winning and what the best move is. 

I want to try this again with more people and the advanced rules.

This game is so simple I can't understand why it's so prone to AP. Move your car to one point of 25 around your marker pawn. Replicate the move the car just made with the pawn. Try not to crash. That's pretty much it other than some rules for starts, collisions and a stupid hard-braking rule that I house-rule out - get your speed right into the corner. If you're going too fast, you crash. Whilst other cars are making their moves, I have my next one planned. The only modification comes if someone moves their car onto the point I wanted for mine. If you are blocked from making a legal move by other cars, THEN you can have a hard-braking exception.

It's no different to a game I used to play in class with graph paper and a pen. Usually there were only two racers because you played with the person sat next to you as desks were paired. We all understood it then. Now, everyone complains that it's like a maths lesson, which it isn't. Even with the move ruler, which makes things unbelievably transparent, some people struggle with this one. It's fab. I love it, and there's no reason for it to be slow. With the right people, it plays much more quickly than Formula De.

WOW! So much more elegant, simple and yet complex, than Formula De! Feels a lot more like F1 racing, without the clunky use of dice to represent gears. This opens a whole new world of possibilities - vector-based dogfights, naval battles, etc. Brilliant.H owever the total lack of randomness is also a knock against the game; perfect-information settings tend to create a lot of downtime once the number of players reaches a certain critical mass (which I would put at 4 with this game). It also creates the problem of a "solvable" game, where if a player spends enough time thinking about it, he will eventually find the one, and only, best line possible throughout the course. These two factors keep my rating down, but it's still an awesome game.

Thinky and mathy deterministic racing game. I didn't believe it could actually last 2 hours, and yet we almost reach that playtime in just one lap.

An interesting concept, but ultimately not enough "race" to this game. It's awfully slow with a lot of calculating. The fact that the rules oblige you to do this calculating in your head for most of the time makes it all that much more complicated.

The game is terrifically dry, and lacking in excitement, especially if you play the game well. Taking chances is really not a good thing here, so there's a good chance you end the race 4 to 5 hours later in exactly the same position as you started.

Too much math, too complex, too slow, too lacking in excitement.

The hard braking rule seems a bit overpowered, since you can really charge into the turns and cut them short. It doesn't really take much longer than Formula De once you get the movement down, so I think it's a bit better in that regard, since you have more control over your movement. Want to try with some of the more advanced rules, but feel that the braking might still be an issue.

First impression: I must say that mechanic how the car is "driven" is clever. It makes playing short of feeling like driving a car and forces you to think your driving lines.

Driving system was nice, it really made you analyze and visualize as far as you could. 

The track was too big to drive two laps. The problem is that two laps is an optimum.

This is the kind of game that needs multiple tracks in collection.

Interesting variation on auto racing, but I found it to be just too fussy and non-intuitive. Experience would speed up the game but it played twice as long as Formula De.

There is a lot more to the game than the vector movement. I don't think the game can be fully enjoyed unless the advanced rules (minus quali) are used. Revision: it just takes too long...
Not viable for what it is. I like Formula D better and would like to try Powerboats and Rallyman.

I enjoyed the no-luck nature of this race game, but do worry that it will make for a boring game after a few plays on each track.  Seemed to have the problem that once a player was in the lead, you couldn't stop them from taking the "best" route, and made it impossible to gain on them.

Really a unique game, and very competitive, very cerebral.  There are press-your-luck events in the play that are generally not even played, often not even known to be part of the ruleset.  But they're essential to the nature of the game, a way to get into the mix or stay ahead of the guy storming up behind you.

This game does not come into its own until you've played five or so times.

Enjoy racing games, and this one's very different. I like the mechanics - all of us try to find the best route for each other, so it becomes very cooperative (at least in the early stages...). Not the easiest game to teach, especially the breaking rules; they break the 25 intersection pattern and can confuse players.

Gee, I want to really like this, but there just seems to be something missing.  It is almost brilliant, but I'd hate to be the one that says it, it could use a little luck.  I admit I didn't play with the advanced rules, but in the basic game, when you are behind the best you can hope for is that someone in front of you makes a mistake.  There is a likelihood, but that is a weird way to play a game.  One lap is more than sufficient, otherwise this game is way too long.  It seems like these tracks could be solved, the only way around this would be to have more players to muck things up, but then you also would have a worse chance of catching the leader.

I still want to like the game, and will try it with the advanced rules someday.

RATING: 6
It's a car racing game. The major innovation is the use of vectors. A pawn in front of your car represents velocity: the further it is, the faster you are going IN	THAT DIRECTION. So it's going to harder to take turns when you're going fast. But you don't need to understand vectors to start playing: the mechanism is simple - move your car to any vertex within 2 vertices from the pawn, then duplicate the cars movement with the pawn (starting at the CAR). In addition you can try to boost your engine (and risk taking damage --> decreased performance) and also ram cars (possible damage). A full game is a 2 lap race.

I love the use of the pawn to show your momentum - very nice. But the RACE game took 160 min! Sure, 5 of us were new, but we only played 1  lap! Maybe the track is too long (apparently it always takes hours for the game). I'm also concerned about the near total lack of randomness: it seems like it would get predictable after everyone knew the courses, with pole position winning most of the time. Would try it again, but not with 6!

RATING: 8
An amazing concept in a race game which I'm totally addicted to, at least for now, maybe because I haven't mastered it yet.  It's a thinking, planning type of race game rather than a fast-paced free-for-all.  I hope they're planning more tracks in the future.

The best formula one racing game ever - and I have played tons of them. In this game, players get overtaken not because of bad die rolls but because of mistakes. It's amazing how many driving errors you can do when trying to steer your car through the corners and chicanes.

Sad thing is that Ghenos Games does not appear to be producing new courses anymore :-(

Played 3+ times.  The vectors really do a good job of simulating movement of the cars and I can almost feel the weight of the car drifting around as I try to compensate for a bad line out of a corner.  When you're slip streaming down the final straight away and you pull a boost out of the engine to pass for the win it's exhilarating.  The tracks could be analyzed for the best lines and I thought about drawing them on the track (like skid marks) so that everyone would have the information but I think that might suck some fun out of the game.  The 30 sec timer takes care of most of the AP and turns move along at a pretty good clip.  If you make a mistake it can be quite hard to catch up but I've seen some amazing things happen with slip streaming.  I'm looking forward to my group getting a bit of experience under their belts and having some amazing races.  I did notice that if the individual x and y components of your velocity are limited to 7 you can cover much more physical distance on diagonal sections of track/map and I thought about limiting your velocity to x <= 7 and y <= 7 and (x+y) <= 10 but this may prove too fiddly.  **UPDATE: As this is a game of skill, it may prove more and more difficult to get people to play this . 2006/03/31 Expansions Owned: Tracks #1

Unusual and quite clever vector based system. Entertaining once. But at well over an hour for a lap, this is not a race game that is going to trouble the scorers. If it were speeded up by a factor of 10, it might be a reasonable representation of rallycross or touring cars.

A good racinggame whitout a lot of cards and dice. Once you got the Bolide way of thinking, the game goes smoothly. You got the racefeeling with the action dice ehere you can take a risk to victory, but also ended up hurt. Less luck and more thiking but as good as Formula De!

By far my favorite racing game to date.  It really gives the feeling of driving a race car where knowing the track and ideal racing line are the keys to victory.  That fact doesn't make this a good choice for people that 1. don't follow road racing or 2. don't race in real life.  That said, from my perspective the game is freaking brilliant.  I would like to try Tacara if I could ever find a copy.

Great Game.  The movement mechanic is really very fun and after a few games is quite intuitive (though you still need to count for exact pawn placement).  My favorite race game.

Update:  Rating stays the same.  I still love the game, but it takes sooo long to run a race that I just don't get to play it nearly as much as I'd like.

Update:  You must play with the simultaneous pawn placement variant. It really speeds up play and livens things up. Sadly it is still hard to get to the table because it is slow and thinky.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 5
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3


Overall - 1.25

Wow what a great movement mechanic.  It's based loosely on the pencil/paper racing idea but is much more dynamic and allows for a lot of control over you car.  You can shift up and down each turn and movement can be as harsh or mild (turn wise) as you like. For those who don't like the dice driven Formula De'  this IS the race game for you.  If you like the simplicity of Formula De' however this one might have too much to it to really get you going.

Exceedingly clever and simple movement system, but lacks drama without the additional rules for car damage etc, which complicates what's initially a very clean game.

(Way past due) UPDATE: Bolide's fatal flaw was the lack of any sort of catch-up mechanism. Playing recklessly in such a perfect-information environment guaranteed eventual problems further down the road (no pun intended), which made any sort of dramatic upsets all but inconceivable.

For however clever the movement mechanism was, it was hard to hide that the first person who pulled ahead usually stayed that away across the finish line.

Played at Great Hall Games (Greg's game). A very unique game -- an incredibly believable racing simulation. The car's momentum is directed by a second pawn, so the driver can only change the moment by a determined amount. It is vector-based racing. 

One issue is that a driver may get a bad lap and have a very hard time catching up. I need to understand whether the lagging players can "cooperate" to catch the leader.

The game can be expanded with advanced mode, pit stops, rain conditions, etc.

I'm still a bigger fan of Formula De but this game provides a nice minimal-luck alternative that forces you to think in terms of realistic acceleration and deceleration.

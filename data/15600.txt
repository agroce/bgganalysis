This game is fantastic; probably the best new game for me of 2005. I love the speed at which the game moves along, the limited manuverability, the character roles, the fort cards and the option of replacing them with a draw... I think the mechanics work very nicely together. I've only played three players so far and I feel that it is perfect with that  number. We haven't experienced runaway leader problems yet, but I've read variants that seem to take care of that problem. All in all, my favorite game of the moment!

RATING: 8.5
Very good game.  It has elements of Knizia's Samurai maybe and also elements of other other area control games, yet somehow it feels very fresh.  Part of this is down to the playing time.  Even with 4 players this is likely to be less than an hour.  It's a game where the first 5 of the 11 scoring sections (upon play of a Castillion) can come in 40 mins and the last 6 in the remaining 20.  In other words, it speeds up as it goes along.  There's a lot of strategy to it and some tactics, too.  Do you follow the visible cards, try to go for harvesting crops of the same type, or place pieces in the areas that could score the highest, hoping that a relevant fort card will come up?  Nice!  

The board, box and pieces are in the top 10% of attractive Euro games.  Basically, I think this is a game that deserves more praise than it's probably had, and it's certainly worth buying - go get a copy from Germany...you'll only need to print off the rules from here and it'll save you a packet.  And, isn't it nice to find an attractive, fairly original Euro that is deep yet quick to play?

[i]Kreta[/i] has a strong [i]Puerto Rico[/i] vibe, but plays faster and there is more randomness to the scoring. There is one wrinkles to the rules (regarding scoring), but the main thing is what actions are allowed by each character card. Once you learn that, you are good to go.

A very streamlined, playable game that presents some tricky decisions.  It reminds me somewhat of Maya in its blending of a bunch of familiar mechanisms into something a bit different. There is some luck in the turn of the region cards, but this can be mitigated by well-timed use of the Castellan

I've been to Crete on holiday and I was expecting something to match my experience of the island - a pleasant, none-too-taxing and relatively chilled out game. What came out of the box was quite a stressful and intense battle involving strategy and tactics, defence and aggression. There is some luck in which provinces get scored, but there appear to be enough options to mitigate this factor. I like this game a lot.

Area control game with attractive components, fast play, and good scalability.  I feel like I should rate this game higher, but something about it just doesn't sit right with me.  There are some turn order issues and the game sometimes feels a bit too lucky- these issues aren't a big deal though.

{1 play, 4 player} it may not last for long, but I'm really liking this one for now.  Yeah, it's yet another area majority game, and there can be a runaway leader, but I just like the everyone-gets-the-same-actions-cards thing.  And it plays fast.  Sort of Web of Power-ish not in gameplay, but in feel: I felt like there was a lot going on in very short game.  We'll see how I feel by next year.

On the surface, the game has many elements and can appear confusing.  It takes a while to explain all the components and how each works.  The reward for taking the time to do this is a solid strategy game with a real fluid feel.  Players must think 2 or more turns ahead to plan, but be prepared to react in the current turn to opponents actions.  This tug of war between then and now creates a pleasant tension in the game.

Initial rating, based on playing twice. Pretty brutal area control game. Hard to plan far in advance, and yet advance planning is crucial. Looks absolutely lovely, but has agonizing choices. Seems very well balanced, though I suspect it's still rather early to be able to say that for real. The end game surprisingly speeds up a lot, as people already having advantageous positions just trigger scoring rounds.

RATING: 5
It's a rather simple game, but with so many things going on at the same time, it can be deceivingly hard. While the scoring mechanics are a masterpiece, the game "story" is rather dull. You just try to move your same resources all around the board, and try and build on the indicated spots. And that's about it.

Not a boring game, but I wouldn't long to play it again.

UPDATE: I still don't get it. I like my games to have tough decisions, but this one feels a bit anticlimactic, and way to chaotic to be enjoyable. Down to a 5.

[i]Posted: 7/4/2010, Rated: 8[/i]

"Area Control" is an interesting mechanism for me.  I think I like it.  I want to like it.  However, it is usually implemented as "draw a random card to determine where you're allowed to move, and then decide how to maximize your scoring potential for that space."  [i][thing=199]Manhattan[/thing][/i] followed that formula, as did [i][thing=1041]San Marco[/thing][/i], although in the latter case there was  the schoolyard practice of "I divide, you choose" to distribute cards.  It wasn't until I tried [i][thing=491]Web of Power[/thing][/i] where paired cards could be used as a wild card that I found the freedom I so desperately sought from an area control game.

Enter [i]Kreta[/i] with a different solution: Role selection determines which pieces you can move.  You can place a piece almost anywhere on the board to bring it into play.  After that, some pieces can be moved depending upon the role selected.  This freedom of movement makes [i]Kreta[/i] a satisfying area control game.

The random deck element still rears its head, though: the regions to be scored are drawn from a deck.  At any time before the final scoring round, the next two regions to be scored are known: this allows players to fight over the currently-contested region, and/or position themselves for the next one.  One role in particular, the Commander, provides you with four "movement points" for your villagers.  Remembering to use any surplus points to better position distant villagers for the [i]next[/i] contested region is an important consideration.

The game itself looks beautiful.  I was originally enchanted by this picture:

[ImageID=82768]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[i]Picture by [geekurl=/user/GeoMan]GeoMan[/geekurl][/i]

The German role cards are easy enough to understand, but having English summary placards is nice to have.  Fortunately [geekurl=/user/npetry]npetry's[/geekurl] translations ([filepage=25511]part 1[/filepage], [filepage=25512]part 2[/filepage]) are excellent, and look wonderful when mounted on to cardboard as his instructions suggest.

Some people complain that the random deck element still exists, but I feel that its effects can be mitigated to some extent, and that the freedom of movement provided by the role selection mechanic far outweighs this objection.  [i]Kreta[/i] is a solid entry that for some unknown reason never benefitted from a wide release in the U.S.  If you're a fan of the Area Control mechanic and you're willing to put out some effort to localize a German copy, then you should seek it out.

Mostly tactical area majority game where your actions are limited by a role selection mechanic which only let's you select each role once until the next scoring action is played. Which areas on the board get scored is up to the intersection cards which always show the next two scoring positions. This means that some areas on the board will never get scored and others will score multiple times. So most play will focus on the upcoming locations as you can't really afford to waste actions elsewhere.

I really like the tight play and interaction between the players. You're always faced with the choice to improve you position on the board or score as it is now and have some influence on what the next scoring card will be. The added hand management challenge and the different player pieces and their abilities make for a varied and fresh game where you have lot's of options.

Too tactical for me.  Way too much flying by the seat of your pants.  I had difficulty building a play.  Perhaps it gets better after more plays, but I have too many games that I'd rather play first, than another game of this.  I'm glad I was able to play before I bought. 

Update (June 09):  Well I bought and played in person for the first time (after a second game online).  It is tactical but the key is keeping fluid and trying to control scoring to get your best plays.  A better game in person.

Nice area control game, with a number of different bits of wood (villagers, villages, boats, forts etc.) to place to score control and to perform other special tasks, all of this controlled by 7 cards. The areas to contend are determined by another set of cards and the person scoring has a veto on the card turned to score later on.

It appears to me that players will normally score very closely together, given that it is very easy to cancel our / tie other players.  Getting an edge comes down to one or two well timed moves or some good draws on the deck or both.  I like this game since it can be played fairly quickly.  Reminder for future: resources of the same type give you bonus points!

Rating based upon only one play with four players, which was a bit longer than I expected (90 minutes). But it was the first game for all of us and quite enjoyable despite the length, so I'm eager to play again soon. Kreta is a rich area majority gamer's game where you almost always want to do more than you can accomplish in your turn. Leader bashing is not only possible, but seems downright necessary for survival. So when deciding how to play your Abbot and Kastellan, always ask yourself, "Who's in first?"

The tension in this game is largely about whether to play long term or short term. For instance, fight for the current area, or the next one. Lay down powerful stationary structures or less powerful mobile ones. Farm or work towards the current areas up for grabs.

My biggest concern is that the game is self-correcting through point denial to the leader, that victory comes down to some small decision made earlier in the game that gave you the one point advantage you needed to win.

This strikes me as a game that people could play next if they like "China" but want more meat (I have yet to play Web of Power).  However the design does allow someone to lose ground and not be able to recover and if there are unequal players, the experience will not be positive for the newbies.

Nice area control game. I liked the limited set of actions and players deciding on their turn if they want an area to score or to put more of their pieces on the board.

RATING: 5
A fine action selection/area majority game where timing is everything. Several differently-powered piece types provide control in different ways and move (or not) in different ways. All adjacent regions score when a vertex comes up in the scoring cards and a player plays the 'score' card. That player also has a small amount of control of the future of the scoring row itself.

As a general matter, the game moves along at a good enough clip, but the beginning is a fairly dry tit-for-tat affair, the end is a calculable puzzle, and only the brief middle, once enough pieces have been played, allows for some strategic possibility.

Charming enough. But not my thing. A pity since it has been on my radar for years.

There is a fair amount of luck here, and I'm not sure the turn-order advantage is adequately dealt with...but otherwise I quite like the game.

RATING: 3
Kreta, on reflection, feels like "Generic Area Influence Game"...I don't know if that is the fault of Dorra, who is a pretty solid game designer, or if it simply reflects the limitations that one faces when tackling such an established game concept. 

Kreta has a fairly basic AIG premise: put guys into areas, gain a majority, and score points. The hook is that the guys are placed onto the board using a role-driven system that limits players from doing the same thing more than twice a round, and that one is unsure what areas are going to be scored, and how many times. The latter idea is already a fairly entrenched concept in the genre, and can be dismissed as such, while the former seems like a neater idea than it seemed to be in practice; as I never felt particularly constrained by the deck.

A minor niggle that I had with the game play was the seemingly entrenched nature of player positions...there seemed to be several ways to lock down an area, or a block of areas, and once one was there it was nearly impossible for the other players to interfere. I think this highlights why the offensive removal cards that are common in the genre (i.e.: Grande, San Marco, Liberte) are so important...while they inject chaos, they also allow the board to change significantly from round to round...without that option things seem to stagnate, and the game felt more lifeless than it needed to be.

The bottom line is that this game isn't bad, but it fails to stand out in a very crowded niche, and hence, is something that I will actively avoid playing in the future.

One play.  Area control games are not my thing to begin with, and I think this one also rewards card counting (i.e. remembering those territories that have been discarded).  Combine that with a runaway leader problem (at least in my one play) and this made for an unfun gaming experience.  I'd try it again, but it's not something I'm going to pull.

RATING: 8
Feels like an old classic from the '90s. Very approachable. Nothing incredibly fresh enough to make it a blockbuster, but a rather nice incarnation of a territory control game. The catches are that there are a few different types of ways to exert influence in a region, the order of territories to score is unknown (sort of like Majaraja), and also that 2-4 regions are scored at a time, giving people a few options to consider. Also interesting is the option for any player to call for scoring whenever they want instead of playing a card that would otherwise let them do stuff on the board, so you never really know for sure whether your current move is your last before the next scoring.

I've played this game twice now, once at Spiel 2005, and once a few years later. The game held some fascination for me and my sweetheart because of fond memories of this island. We went for the name rather than the game. Kreta is a majority game with a few interesting little gimmicks. Once you know the various options available to each card, the game plays quite smoothly, becoming quite tactical in nature as the forts around which points will be earned come up randomly. It's a bit of a push-your-luck element as forts which have been scored will not make it back to the draw deck, so the chances of drawing another increase. The character powers allow you to influence the majority positions in several ways, so a bit of hand management is also required. In my very limited experience, I noticed that the tactical nature leads to a see-saw style of play. If you have influence twiddling its thumbs on one part of the island, you move them as fast as possible to the part where the scoring will occur, at the same time annoying other people with well-placed abbots. On the other hand, you don't have sufficient cards to do a full see-saw everytime, so there's some form of staying put and hope for the best too. I'm not really sure the unpredictability of the fortress cards saves this game from the rating of 'average at best'. The game is inoffensive and does require the players to do a little min-maxing in their heads given the constraints of the cards in their hand and those already played by others, but that is seemingly all you can do.

Kreta has been on and off my wishlist ever since I played it first, but now that I got in a second go, I've decided that while joining in a game is not something I'd say 'no' to, owning it is a bridge too far.

RATING: 8
Thoughts:
Quick/Tight area control game. If you like El Grande, you should really look into this one. The problem with El Grande is that it usually requires 5 (maybe 4) people interested to get it played. You get much of the same feeling with Kreta for 3 or less players. Additionally, my first time playing this game took less than 60 minutes including rules explanation.

Diary:
Acquired July 2008.  Fun game.  Played it online a couple times.  Very hard to get anyone to play this face-2-face.  Complaint is that you have to keep track of too many numbers for area control.  Damn those online implementations.

March 2010 - Finally played this face to face with my family.  Surprisingly, my kids enjoyed it enough to want to play again.  I had terrible results with China which is a game similar to this.

So far, this seems to be a very thinky type game (like Samurai) so there isn't a lot of talk.  Have to be in the mood for that type of game here.

April 2010 - Eldest son won this one.  Rules are starting to fade into the background now.  This is a really, really good area control game.  Like it better than China already.

May 2010 - Played with other half of my game group.  Very intense with some AP slowing down the game.  Game was won a couple turns prior to the final scoring so it was a bit undramatic finish.

Rating is after one two-player half game, one three-player game and one four-player game.  It is a bit of a brain burner, but then pretty well all area control games are.  This one flows very well and it doesn't take long when you remember what all the cards do.  Good stuff.  Aesthetically pleasing too.

Good game. I have only played it with two players but I really enjoyed it. I like the fact that even though there are a lot of planning involved there's still the random factor of which spot is next to score. Don't play with players you know have AP tendencies as the game will take forever then. Update: Tried it with 4 players and it dragged on for too long, perhaps it's better with 3 players?

Nem is tudom. Nem túl szép, de ez egy dolog. Igaz nem is csúnya. A szokásos egy adag kártyád van abból választgat az ember, visszaveszi egy bizonyos lappal, ami értékel is -de ekkor mindenki. Nekem jobban tetszik a Castle for all season megoldása, amikor csak az veszi vissza, aki leteszi az adott lapot. És ugyan sok lehetőség, de valahogy mégis korlátosnak tűnik.

solid, well designed gamers game.
very simple rules that come together to well. Appears to have been play tested and refined into a finished game. A fine effort by Dorra.

Only reason I do not rate it an 8 and that I may drop it to a 7, is the fact that AP issues have really prolonged this game into the 2 hour range. It really should be played in about 1 hour.

Suffers from the "languishing factor" where if someone gets behind they stay behind and have to watch others race to the win with slow and quiet play.  If a variant is hatched that mitigates the rich getting richer then I'd enjoy it a lot more but right now I'm not that thrilled to play it.

This area control game has a few interesting things going on.  The first is a set of action cards that will be used throughout the game.  Used cards can't be re-played until one of the action cards get all the previous ones back.  A lot of the action cards had dual functions.  I also like that this game has 4 different types of pieces and they all have unique characteristics.  The other thing about the game is the scoring cards.  There's a line of them that are mostly face-down and when the line is empty the game is over but when a region is scored (by a player playing a specific action card) that player will look at a face down card and leave it or replace it from one within the deck.  Overall it was decent and I'd be willing to play again but I feel with so many area control games out there, there are better options.

There are lots of area control games
(which feel like auctions for space and auctions are not a favorite)
however this one is different because of the Castellan which triggers 
scoring and allows some control over the areas to be scored).
We found it was fine with 2, but also played well with 3.
(I tried it with 2, 3 and 4 and personally prefer 2.)

Finally my copy has arrived, after a 3 month wait! I'm rating this an 8 because I think the game combines some nice ideas for a satisfactory result. However, I may downgrade this as recently playing makes me wonder if the leader is better off forcing Castellan scoring as soon as possible. Maybe developing your farming to obtain the food to build towns is not worth it. But I am open to persuasion. Some analysis paralysis may go away with experience.*** Played again with 2 hardened gamers and it was a fast tight game, finishing in a dead heat with the 3rd player 2 pts back! This time I harvested and got 2 houses in, which helped. It was still beneficial to hit the scoring as fast as possible, we scored the first 2 cards on the second turn.

Dorra does area control with role management.  Lots of familiar concepts repackaged in a tight game which works very well.  Funny to see the peasants and the priest running all over the map.

Old school euro, fairly straight forward area majority game.

The game is slow to start and finish, but the mid game is engaging. Play of the scoring card is perhaps the more interesting decision to be made. Early game is mostly spent putting your wood pieces on the board, the end game slows up because once all future scoring is revealed you can calculate the final scores if you trigger scoring, so the game drags a bit as players determine if they can win or if they have to take an action to improve their position instead of ending the game. Overall not amazing, but a fine game and one that plays in a shorter period of time than many similar games.

It works, but there's no spark of life.  Kreta is a reasonably entertaining game to play once, but there's nothing there to draw me back for a second play.  No ingenuity, no delicious tension, nothing I haven't seen in other, better games.  The sluggish movement of pieces leads to entrenched positions, and so the random flip of the scoring cards dominates play.  Kreta reminded me a lot of Maharaja, so if you liked that game (I thought it was pretty awful), you might like this one more than I did.  Both feature entrenched positions that are difficult to overcome, and in both games players can expend resources to control when and where the majority scoring will happen.

This is a great area control game that I always enjoy playing. Kreta proves that this genre can still be revitalized and account for some of the best games available. Most likely, this game could never have been designed if games like El Grande and Kardinal und KÃ¶nig had not preceeded it. But it's a tribute to the designer to skillfully build upon this fine tradition and create something familiar, yet quite original and thoroughly enjoyable.

The one drawback (from my point of view) is that the game can be very unforgiving. One mistake can place a player far behind his opponents, with limited opportunities to catch up.

One should play this with the variant proposed on the Geek (which limits the opportunities for players to play the Castillan).

Good game; better than I initially expected.  Lots of interesting decisions to make.  The cards suck, though; they should have included language-neutral icons to make it obvious which cards do what.  Do you play the Commander (or, rather, the German word for it) when you want to play or move a villager, or the Farmer?  I had to look at the cheat sheet almost every turn.  More care put into the cards would have made it more obvious.

RATING: 8
Area influence:role selection:hand management

initial rating after one play Essen 06

I like games with card play typically and this one is no exception. Cards are played to decide what actions you will take (building specific pieces, blocking, moving, scoring) and once down you don't get them back until scoring is completed so planning and tactics are important here. When you choose to build each piece you can place they have different levels of influence and you have a very limited supply, most are fixed pieces on the board but some are movable making it quite interesting. AP is only there very very slightly due to your somewhat limited look ahead as most of the future scoring regions are hidden, this also limits your planning however but it is there and quite necessary, more regions known would drive up the AP so this keeps it playing fast. 

You have to decide where you will play your "key" pieces in order to optimize scoring as much as possible, this is tricky as if you wait you can lose the good spots but waiting can also pay off. Having the option of choosing when scoring takes place is interesting and it keeps the tension up, the player who initiates this also has a chance to change one of the future scoring regions...nasty. 

Lots to like with strategy and tactics in good proportions, also a quick pace and great game length will ensure table time for this game. Waiting to see if this so called runaway leader problem shows up and if so it will be quickly mitigated with a variant of some sort, the most obvious being a limit on when scoring can be chosen. 3 looks like the sweet spot due to space and possibly AP/downtime with 4 but I will be playing with all numbers and update as I bought the game.

[u]UPDATE:[/u] 5 plays, rating sticks - excellent with 3, good with 2 as well and haven't tried 4 yet. We play that the scoring card can NEVER be played first turn and only second turn if you are losing, no runaway leader problem AT ALL. Great game. 

[u]TIDBIT[/u] - We also play that with 2 players the region max is 5 and with 3 players region max is 6. This seems like the natural regression as with 4 players the max is 7, not changing this makes the max harder to hit with less players and also too many pieces in one area of the board.

[u]UPDATE:[/u] Not sure what happened but our last 2 games had a bit of a runaway leader, the first 7 did not. It very well might have been that this player just out positioned and outplayed us, will play more and update 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.7
Nothing very new here, just another area control-majority game.  I had higher hopes for the game upon reading the rules but as I played it just felt repetitious and too long. Potential problems? The leader forged ahead in our game and never looked back.

RATING: 7
Fun little area control game.  Sort of like a lighter blend of El Grande and Taj Majal, but only kind of.  Fast paced, with an action limiting mechanism that works well (you may only do most actions once per scoring round, at which point all of your actions reset.)

I'll play it again when given the chance.

Update:  It's possible that this game plays better with three than four.

RATING: 6.5
Rating after one play; subject to change upon more sessions. Rather fun area control game with some interesting mechanisms, but flawed (IMO) by the scoring mechanic. Might be more balanced if the choice of the upcoming region card was controlled by someone OTHER THAN the person who played the Castellan. Tying the collection of agriculture tiles to city construction is a nice idea, but the number of points associated with the tiles is really too insignificant to merit spending much effort trying to acquire matched sets.

RATING: 6.5
A little too much randomness in drawing the scoring cards, and
the rest of the game is highly abstract.

RATING: 7
An area control game where pieces are placed based on the card that you play from your hand, each player has the same set of cards. Scoring occurs only when a player plays his scoring card and then points are awarded based on who has control of the regions being scored. The person who initiated scoring also has some control as to what region will score later in the game. However, he also plays last in the next round. This is a nice control game with several ways to score and an opportunity to plan for future scoring rounds.

Kreta is an interesting little majority game set on the island of Crete. The island is divided into provinces with a numbered fort space on all the intersections. There are 26 numbered fort spaces. A deck of cards corresponds to the numbers on the forts and 11 of those cards are drawn and lined up face-down at the beginning of the game. Scoring is triggered 11 times, once for each card, and the provinces that are scored are those connected to the fort space on the card. You only have visibility to the next two forts being scored, so the game is fairly fluid and unpredictable. There are a number of game piece that each score and move in different ways. You activate a piece by playing a personality card from your hand. Once played, you cannot play that card again until after the next scoring. There are also goods on each province that can be collected for additional points.

Kreta is a great game for what it is. It is fairly light, but still forces interesting decisions and it is great putting the ability to time the scoring into the players' hands. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Area majority and control games are a dime-a-dozen, but for my money, this is the best of the genre.  The mechanism using cards that are not retrievable is clever, as is the fact that the person choosing to do scoring doesn't get any opportunity to add/move units on the board.  The use of farming tiles to score VPs and as a pre-requisite to place 2-point villages is also an interesting feature.  All the mechanics of this game work really well in this very finely balanced design.

Rating is based on about 20 plays so far.

The gameplay is a little too static due to the lack of randomness (aside from the scoring), seems like you would know in advance if you can contest a region or not if you take the time to do the math.

RATING: 7
Mmmm, fresh and zesty. This games makes a great first impression. 

Kreta is an area majority game with a simple twist. Majorities are fought over with distinct pieces: armies, fortresses, ships, and Cardinals. Each has a somewhat different role, and I found it engaging trying to figure out how best to combine them. There are resources on the board that must be claimed in order unlock access to some of the pieces mentioned above. The timing of scoring is entirely player-driven. Essentially it's done Twilight Struggle style but everyone has a scoring card at all times. You have to use up your action to score. Your relative position on the score track forces leaders to wait n rounds before using a scoring card again, where n is equal to the number of players behind you. Regions are not scored in Kreta; intersections between regions are. Only a subset of them are scored each game, with only the next four known to the table at any given time. Players who score reveal the next region at the end of the chain, and they have the option of spiking it. This provides an interesting element of long-term control.

That's pretty much it. Very much an area majority game, very unlike any other game in the genre that I've played.

RATING: 6
Nifty area control game with a gorgeous board. I like the variety of different unit types that you use to garner influence. The card/action system is constricting enough make for difficult choices. The board is dynamic through the interplay of unit types and the scoring mechanics. I think the planning is a bit too focused on short term objectives for me to really fall in love with this game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A friend remarked that Kreta reminded him of Samurai and Maharaja.  I have to agree.  Like Samurai (and many other area influence/control games) you gain influence through different types of pieces placed on the map.  However, each piece has different capabilities and some have different levels of influence.  Some pieces are fixed, and others can move.  Like Maharaja (and Taj Mahal), you have to watch to see which areas will be scored next and plan accordingly.  I also like the different characters and the restrictions on using them.  There are a lot of fun choices to make.  I look forward to playing this again.  It plays well with 2 players, but 2 can't be ideal - 3 or 4 would be great.  I also like that it plays quickly.

Update - a fun game, but there's nothing to make it stand out from all the other area majority games to make me want to play this.  If I ever get the urge I'll just play online.

Traded away.

RATING: 4
I can't say I'd love to try this again. Most of the game is fun and everything seems to be working well, but... the endgame is clearly broken: the leading player can simply play his Castellan-card and win and this is happening already some scorings before the end. Also the 'areas to be scored' -system would need some clear house rules to make the game more balanced. Now someone may lose way too much because of luck. Other than that I realised while playing Kreta why Liberté is my favourite area control game: no endless stacking/piling competitions.

RATING: 6
An area control game that innovates beyond Web of Power incorporating role choice, planning elements, and much less luck. I need to play it more to know whether I like the almost complete lack of hidden information. The key will be seeing how much tactics vary based on the game state. Update: after a few more plays I am not as enthusiastic. I still like the game but I am not suggesting it much. I would like a bit more of a probability element. The cards for future regions only partly covers that.

I've played twice, years apart.  Both times I've had fun.  In Nov. 2008, I was given this as a B-Day gift from TG, Sally and Zack.  So now the game has a chance to get some additional plays.

I like the mix of pieces, the limited assets, the trade off of exerting influence, yet being forced to farm.  But the Kastellan seems over powered.

I've read the suggested variants, and I think I will adopt a house rule where the Kastellan card cannot be the first card you play if you are winning.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
[2007.Jul.24] This is not your typical area majority game. Instead, it is an excellent combination of area majority and role selection mechanics. The card-based role selection mechanism is used to activate your game pieces (or scoring), thereby determining when you may place/move a specific type of game piece during your turn. The physical components are attractive, functional, and simple; the five types of wooden game pieces are easy to recognize and are not throwbacks [thankfully!] to Carcassonne-style meeples.

The game scales well, but handles 3- and 4-players exceptionally well. Additionally, the "first-player advantage" discussed here on BGG is a myth. A truly underrated, but highly recommended game!

After playing this game for the first time on MaBiWeb, I have since added it to my own collection.

A VERY good streamlined, elegant Dorra design that has an excellent blend of mechanics including area influence, roles card mgt., score card timing display and managing your limit of various meeple-like character pieces.  Some of the luck lies in what "future" score cards flip up but all cards are faced-up so there's not much memorization.  It's rules are mostly simplistic but Kreta, being so elegant, has a suprisingly good deal of depth.

Area majority game based on 7 different roles.  People choose which role and carry out the action.  Everything has an influence of one except for the village which has an influence value of two.  Regions are scored based on fort cards that intersect the different regions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
This strikes me as an almost perfect game. It is certainly good, but it tries to do too much.

As an area influence game, it has a lot of good things going for it. The scoring system is cool because you know the two regions will be scored next. The character selection works well because you cycle through your good actions and have to make agonizing choices when running out of options. Finally, the markers (villagers, villages, forts, abbeys, and ships) work well together and seem to be balanced.

With all these good things, what could possibly go wrong? In a word - farming. First, take a colorful board with colorful components, then place cardboard tiles all over it. Bleh! Next, provide scoring for these tiles that has nothing to do with the other aspects of the game (you get more points for collecting sets of tiles). Finally, provide a mechanism for collecting tiles that is very odd (you need a line of villages from the tile to your ship). In short, nothing about the farming made any sense with the game.

I do appreciate that the tiles are needed to place the more powerful villages, but it seems like there are better ways to do without adding excess to an already brilliant design.

I've only played online, via Mabiweb, so take that into consideration. There COULD be downtime or physical production issues in ftf play. My own experiences have been very good, however, both 2-player and multiplayer. I think it's helped by NOT having simultaneous selection. You get to see what happens and then make your choice. For a small, relatively short game, there is still a need for longterm strategy & positioning.

Samurai + Mission: Red Planet

An area influence game where players move and/or place various shaped pieces on a map in order to exert influence points in a region that will eventually score.  Each player possesses an identical set of cards that are played one at a time and indicate what action the player can take on his turn.  When a specific card is played scoring in a region occurs and everybody gets their cards back.  Only the next two regions to score are known at any time.

I like it but I hate it.  I don't play well and I find it frustrating. But I do find it intriguing because it does scratch some itch for this type of game.  I continually make the same mistake or at least find myself in the same situation in these kinds of games where I'm fighting too many battles with too many different people. You just don't have enough bits on the board to maintain dominance. I usually end up losing both territories (or worse) because I'm spread too thin. 

Kreta doesn't find its way to the table very often but I find myself hesitant to trade it.

A very neat area majority game.  I really enjoyed my first outing of this.  A four player game - 3 players tied for first and the fourth was one point away.  Talk about tight.

My last two plays have felt nothing short of marginal.  The early leader seemed to maintain supremacy all game with no real way to reign him in.  Rating dropped to a six to reflect this.

Not sure if this is addressed in the rules.  When spending movement points for the workers and abbot allow movement through a region which already has 7 units. Otherwise the board can get cut off.

Dorra has put out a respectable area-control game in Kreta.  I appreciated the hand-management which allows players to either place or move their various pieces in order to score or farm (for VPs).  The map & majority battles are great.  I like that multiple regions around an intersection score each round but I didn't enjoy the randomness of where scoring occurs.  Knowing that scoring can occur anywhere should lead one to a flexible strategy.  There are about 35 intersections & 11 will score during the game.  It's irksome when regions that you're not in score multiple times in a row.  Of course you can control this by choosing the scoring card.  UPDATE: This feels more Samurai-ish the more I play it.  UPDATE: Dropped another half a point... there's too many king-making opportunities (intentional or not). Decent design but there are more exciting area control games out there.

In this area control game from Stefan Dorra, each round, one is choosing one of 7 character roles, and putting pieces onto the island of Crete. There are 11 scoring rounds, which are player initiated by the cards. There are commodities to be gathered for points, placement of abbots to deny other players from building, or building forts in key intersections.  A fun game, and could be Stefan Dorra's best game so far. 

There is luck in this game, depending on which provinces come up for scoring. At the same time, it is full of tension. I have only played this with 4 players, so there may be a little more element of control with less players.

Area control game based on moving various figures into Cretean provinces. So far I've only played a 2-player version of this game and it felt a little too random. The Castellan cards brought too much luck into a too open playing field. I think we could have just randomly played our figures and then drawn cards to see who got points. 

Edit: After playing a 4-player game, I think this one is a little too rooted in luck. Still a good game, though. I'd give it another try in the future.

Kreta sounded to me like a cross between Puerto Rico and El Grande, so I was sure that I would like it.  Sadly, I was wrong.  I'm sure that the abundance of unit types in the game (hereafter refered to as 'kibble') were designed to add variety to the game, but they simply added confusion and robbed Kreta of the elegance that El Grande enjoys.  The spaces were often crowded with kibble to the point that it was difficult to make out what was going on in the space.  Strike one.  Another area where the game fell flat was in the scoring system.  This problem was threefold.  The first issue was the randomness of the scoring cards.  Not all areas on the board get scored.  Some get more attention than others leading to a distasteful randomness that EG does not suffer from.  Rather than the this-or-that style of decision in most area control games, players are forced to gamble on what MIGHT come up, and point go to the luckiest. [apparently the rest was trimmed by BBGs max form entry space]

Area control type game. A bit of push your luck thrown in. You have to decide when it's best to score areas, and when it's best to push to gain more control. It seems that there is a balance. It feels like you need to pick your battles and not try and win every time.

Area control game with a nice degree of options and strategic movements.

Plenty of interaction since the very beginning until the very end. In fact, probably it's a bit too much. Maybe it's a bit long; it can be easily shortened, but it's not advised because you will not get to play with everything deployed until the end.

The theme and especially the game components do not favour the game at all. It deserved more.

This is a unique area-control game where locking up control of one part of the island MAY be a good idea, but you won't know for sure until later in the game.  The ability to allow the person who chooses to score change the future scoring regions slightly works excellently, as it makes calling for a scoring a good idea in instances where you really need to change the region that will be scored later in the game.

EDIT:  Rating improved on recent play.  This is an excellent 3-player game.

Terrific area-control game! I REALLY like how this plays. As others have noted, its mechanics are reminiscent of various other Euros, but it is unique as a whole. Fairly abstract, but that's okay--reminds me of several games, including "Settlers of Catan," which certainly has enough of a theme to it. Seems as though the designer thought this out well and play-tested it thoroughly. Looking forward to playing with 2-3 others. Purchased used in June 2009. Had been looking for a copy for a long time, as I like area control games and (nominally) ancients themes.

A good dynamic area control game.  This game definitely has a luck factor that can completely screw you.  Certainly has a momentum factor that allows the leaders to run away.

RATING: 6
Playing through your cards to get your pieces out is fine and healthy, but there are two things that irk. One is the cost of triggering scoring which means the games drags on in between scorings because no one's prepared to pony up until their best cards are played, and the second is the luck of the order in which scoring areas appear - where you may already have pieces or someone else already has pieces. Area majority's not my favourite genre in the first place, so things that don't work well exaggerate the irkedness.

Played once in Dec 2005; liked it so much I bought the game, waited over 3 years to play it again. I played it last night & it lived up to it's memories. 

I think it is a very clever game, with very simple rules, but just enough to think about to make it interesting.

The second time I played it the three others enjoyed it a lot while playing; afterwards one was as enthuisastic as I was the others not so much, but I think they'll all play it again. I hope so!

RATING: 8
With the player-initiated scoring, this game can play out two ways.  The first is a slow game where people can build up strategies over time.  I find this deep and rewarding.  The second is fast in furious, where scoring rounds happen early and often.  This I don't like as much.  Fortunately, most games I've played seem to be of the former variety.

An engaging area control game that reminds me of the game China, but there is a lot more going on here. Some interesting and tough decision making and tense jockying for area control simultaneously in different regions of the board. The cards that indicate which regions will be scored next introduce a random element, but the amount is limited and good planning keeps the randomness to a manageable level. A house rule of keeping the cards of the scored regions face up in sequential order improves the game since it eliminates the memory element, which detracts from play.

I am of two minds with Kreta. Some games are very tense and exciting, others you can be left in the dust due to turn order disadvantage and/or bad scoring card draws. It's possible the scoring cards have too much impact but then, that's what the Castellan is for, right? If the theme were less bland I think I would rate this an 8.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Very similar in concept to Web of Power and China but more complex with significantly more choices. Kreta is to WoP and China what 2210 is to Risk. Unfortunately, too often for comfort, one player can set himself up for a tremendous  leap in scoring and then repeat it without any method (other than 'house rules' for preventing it and that is a serious drawback to the game. As much as I enjoy this game that is too frustrating to bring the game out very often. I should not have to play with 'house rules' just to make a game playable.

A tight area control game, the various piece types allow the action point style placement management. Like how the intersection points trigger the area scoring, and not all locales will score. The hook is the players trigger the scoring, with the person triggering able to alter a future scoring point. 

Not an outstanding game, but a good effort in area control for 3 or 4.

The game is interesting.  It's an okay area influence game.  There are a lot of ways to apply influence on an area, almost too many.  I really like the card actions, though.

An area control game, but a very dynamic one as the scoring areas change as the game progresses.  Some of your influence (villagers, ships, abbots) are mobile, while others (villages, forts) are not.  When do you play the non-mobile forces and where is a key decision.  As is positioning for multiple scoring rounds.  Our games have tended to be quite close which makes for some nice tension through out the game.  An overlooked game.

Nice, quick, and with the kinds of fun decisions you've come to expect from good, old-fashioned area control games.

Rating could easily go up with more plays.

Originally rated it an 8.5 and loved it. After a few more plays the game just doesn't seem to have that spark it first had. I still like it, but it's just slightly above average for me.

Edit - After having this game for a few months and playing it roughly 10 times I found this game just isn't for me. The initial spark was what I liked about it apparently. There are a few problems with the game, but the main one for me and my group is the "screwing people over" aspect of it. Some people take it too personally and my fiance actually screamed at me cause I screwed her over pretty badly. It wasn't intentional, just playing the game. Also there's a bit of a runaway winner in some games, but not all.

--Dec2007-- Gift from 2007 Secret Santa!  Thanks very much!  It's a much more constrained optimization problem than I'd originally expected: over-committing toward one of the initial scoring rounds can leave one's pieces dreadfully out of range for a later score.  Altogether, a really nice little area majority game that doesn't overstay its welcome.  As to score, I think there's a chance it could go up; but I'd need to see the game with a few more player counts.

Much better with three players than with four. Although it seems to be drawing a lot of criticism for being another area majority game - it's a good one. I like the way in which the placement of other players' pieces forces you to adapt your play. You need to conserve your pieces for play at a good time and the different values and roles they play is cleverly done. The reordering of areas to be valued isn't as chaotic as in Raja because there are more available areas in Kreta. Looking forward to exploring further.  I'll only play with the Kastellan variant where you can only play the Kastellan card when you've played at least the number of cards as there are players behind you in the scoring. This negates some of the luck in the game. Without the variant the end game can be just plain silly.

RATING: 5
A couple of nifty ideas like the variable scoring timing and movement of pawns, but the game plods along too slowly. Feels too much like placing a piece at a time, rinse and repeat. The drawing of fort cards also makes this game a little too swing-y based on luck. You just do the best you can given the current situation, which is usually obvious, and praise or curse the next Castellan draw. Kingmaker issues abound near the end, especially since it's sometimes very obvious that you're not in it before the game drives to a conclusion.

[4 plays] 2, 3, and 4 player games. The game is well made with nice components. The play is rapid but can at moments be a brain burner.

Farming doesn't seem to pay off very well with aggressive players in my limited experience.This is a fun game and I'm looking forward to many more plays.

If you took out the lovely map of Crete, this would look like some Star Trek writer's pathetic attempt to create a game for the future. I'm pretty sure that if someone were to walk by and attempt to figure out what was going on their initial impression would be that we were just pretending to play a game.  

Nonetheless, there is a real game here, and boy howdy does it push all the right buttons for me.  As per usual, it revolves around a typical area control system which should be blase by now, but the variety of choices (both constrained and non-constrained), the hand management, the pushing to time scoring, the mobility, vieing for control over which territories score and various abilities that each piece offers makes this fresh and engaging.  

Perhaps it runs a little long, but I get pretty into the system the whole game often doing "The Stand" to check everything out. That means that I'm as into a game as it gets.  I suspect that the rating on this will go up with more plays (UPDATE: And it has).

One that really makes you think, having to weigh when to use certain actions as well as when to go for it now versus playing for the next round.  Pretty easy to learn.  I would like to play it again.  Seems like a game that might be fun once in a while but you wouldn't want to play two or three times in a  row.  Update:  I would still enjoy it occasionally, but it gives me a feeling of claustrophobia partially as a result of the board design itself.  I would prefer a larger board where it's a bit easier to see the numbers.  As it is, it feels like work at times instead of fun.

Dave Andrews Variant: You can only trigger scoring if you've already played as many cards as there are players behind you on the score track.

Area control with role selection and player triggered scoring. Pieces to control the areas have different powers. Not all areas are even scored, only the areas adjacent to intersections that have their cards turned up. (The player triggering scoring gets to discard the new one if they don't like it.) With this mix of mechanics, Kreta sets itself apart from others. After two plays, I'm eager to try it more and see if I can wrap my brain around some strategies. You will have to decide when you want to score, whether you should try to concentrate on getting groups of like produce, how to use your cardinal most effectively. Lots of things to think about and try, with a dash of luck and trying to out think your opponents.

2 player seems woefully out of balance though.

This one might rise in ratings as we play it more.  It has a LOT going on, and all interconneted in a pretty deep fashion.  Plays well for a lunch game--about an hour.

It's also available online and quite fun (and super competetive!).

A well made mix between strategy (short, medium an long). I love it!

tl;dr: Fine, but didn't age that well

I suppose that when this game came out, it was a pretty good offering. Today however, it does feel a bit dated. It's not too bad though. It still works pretty well and has good choices, I just think that newer games have taken some of these elements and improved on them.
I also think that a better version of this game can be found under the name [thing=18100][/thing]. They both have a very similar area majority element. The way you do actions is very different though.
This game runs on an action card system where playing your actions in the right order is an important aspect. Each card allows you to do one specific action, and there's a card to take all played cards back into your hand so you can play them again. That's a good mechanism of course, I just felt that the game wasn't more than the sum of it's parts. It all sounded better then it turned out as a complete package.
Still, not a bad game, don't get me wrong!

A fun game where players compete to gain control in the provinces on the island of Crete. I like all the different character card abilities. This game could have a king-making problem when players feel they have no chance of winning.

Interesting. Running around the island grabbing areas as they're about to score. Making bets on which ones will score more.

Superb mix of role selection and area control. A dynamic ebb and flow of pieces that sweeps across the board, slowly stagnating slowly as all static pieces find their place. Awesome game!

Very good area control game.  Not all that different from one such as Mission Red Planet, but a hair more appealing to me.

RATING: 7
Balance may be an issue in Kreta, and I think the starting players have a bit of an advantage over those who place late, but it's not a huge problem. The varied pieces, their differing values and placement limitations make Kreta quite different than most area-control games. They also add to the overall effect that makes Kreta a beautiful game aesthetically. For some reason, reaction to Kreta has been very luke-warm in my game groups, but I enjoy it quite a bit on the rare occasions when I can get people to agree to play it.

RATING: 8
Kreta is a lighter area influence game that plays fast and is very engaging.  With the English paste-ups, this is much easier to teach than Mission: Red Planet or El Grande.  The end of each scoring session includes a genuine "Let's Make a Deal" moment--would you like this face-up scoring card or the unknown one at the top of the deck?  Gorgeous candy-coated components and beautiful artwork add to the experience.

Play with rule change suggested by Dave Andrews, it's really necessary !

Nice, tight area control game.  The tension of when to pull the trigger on scoring makes for some tough choices.  The variation in which areas will score (and when) makes each game a fresh experience.

I'm a huge fan of area control games (e.g., El Grande, San Marco, Louis XIV, China) and this one looks both gorgeous and like it has a novel twist on the genre.  I'd love to try this one out or find a copy for myself -- UPDATE: Finally purchased an imported copy from FunAgain, and wow is it good!  This is a unique and solid area control game that any fan of the genre should definitely try.  This certainly has the potential to rise to a 10 with more plays.  This is definitely one of the most underrated and overlooked games on BGG.

A lot of nice wooden components. Excellent game mechanisms and simple rules. Great territorial game. It is a beautiful game to see and play. A lot of strategy and some luck that can be regulated. It plays fast, and always there is tension about when scoring will take place. You need to play with the variant that the Castellan can be played only if you have played at least X cards where X is the number of players behind you in the scoring track.

Played 2-player game.  Found this to have a big run-away leader problem.  I was frustrated by the mid-point and no longer found it fun that my opponent could stifle my current and future plans by controlling the scoring area cards.

Would like to try this with 3 or 4 players before giving up on it.

Played this game with two players.
The game is essentially an area majority game and is a decent two player game. As I understand, this game can be brutal with more players...but with the, it was rather tame. The biggest issue here is draw of the luck. If you successively draw several good fort cards for your placements, then you have a significant advantage and it is tough to play catch up. Perhaps with four players, this will get a lot tougher. Not one of my top area majority games, but certainly a decent effort.

Nice little area majority game. The cards should have symbols on them. I had to check the reference sheet all the time what each card did...

I liked this area control game.  I don't know if this was normal, but our game was fairly close most of the way through.  It played pretty quickly too.  There are some pieces that were heavily underused in our game, so hopefully these other pieces allow for strategies that none of us explored.

Definetely one of the better influence games. I still guess, that in many times "score in every opportunity in the latter half of the game if you are in nice lead" is too powerful and kill something from the game.

RATING: 7
Nice area control game with fairly simple rules.  Overall I do like the game and there are tough choices between what's best now, what's good soon, and what might be good later.  It just has a few too many small flaws for me to consider it more highly:

The way the fort cards come out can potentially be quite swingy (though there is a lot of control in taking the scoring action).  The goods mechanic feels pretty weak and not terribly polished.  Can also bog down a bit as you generally need to re-asses your move based on everything your opponents do so you can't plan ahead too much.

3-player & 4-player.  Fun, tense game.  Has similarities to, but is lighter than, El Grande.

Really nice area-control game, that I mostly play online. The movement part of it is a nice twist. Games are usually tensed and scores quite close. Good not-too-well-known game (meaning you could get a good price out of it :-)

Tentative 6 rating for now. My only play was PBEM and that was just clicking on the screen. Rating will potentially go up after a better rules reading and playing.

Stefan Dorra (Medina); Players use different character cards to bring in and move pieces around Kreta which give them influence in the provinces on the island. One of the cards triggers scoring in all the provinces adjacent to a place, and each province gives various Victory Points (VPs) to the 1st and 2nd most influence. At any time, you only know the next two places that will score, so if you cannot gain influence the current place, you can prepare for the next scoring. Area Control.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Area control games aren't my favorite, but if they're on a small enough board, where the players can spread out a little more easily, I have a better time managing them.  Kreta is like that, but the way the scoring is controlled is more or less up to the luck of the draw.  There's some control (players who activate scoring get to choose which card will score two rounds away), but it's a choice between a known region, or another random one off the top of the deck.  It's not much control, and the game sees some really wild swings because of it.

The rest of the game is actually pretty cool.  The role selection actions are nicely balanced, and the restrictions on the different buildings helps add a lot of turn angst to the game.  It's actually hard to fault the card deck for determining the choices and order of the scoring regions (it helps to keep the game variable from one play to the next), but it's also a large part of the game.  For what it is, the game isn't bad, but it's not really great, either.

CAUTION: Initial rating based on 1 play. A unique area majority game with role selection. Also the players decide when scoring occurs. Our initial 4 player games did go over 2 hours. A house rule was added that the scoring can only occurs after a player played several cards based on his position on the score board. I'm not sure tis house rule was so balanced. Would very much like to play the game again.

The cardplaying mechanism reminded me somewhat of that in Flanders 1302, although this is a better executed game. On the whole this game fell falt. It's Just Another Area Majority Game, with nothing special to set it apart from other games in that genre. I expected a little bit more from a Dorra game.

Really shines with 4 players - where the competition gets fierce although it can get a little confusing determining how many points each player has in each province.  Too bad this was never released in the USA.

An easy area control game.  Although it plays in about an hour, it is a quick hour.  Speed of play makes the game better than expected.  It isn't really my kind of game as the random card draw detracts from play (just my opinion as I prefer games with known information).  I would play if it hits the table, but I don't care to have it in my collection.

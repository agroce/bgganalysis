RATING: 7
More complex than the last one.  Nice addition of the "string" puzzles, but I have a feeling most folks will just tear these, as several of them seem fairly unsolvable at first.  The story didn't do much for me, but the design seems a little more polished this time.

In terms of presenting the puzzles and theme of a escape room this game does a great job, even if it is BYO(pen, paper, timer, internet connection for hints if you want them). The actual dial used to see if you solved the puzzles is clever and works well. While it is possible to reset the game, its only a single play through, then pass on to a friend who wasn't there that night.

Absolutely hated some of the physical puzzles in this one. The remainder of the puzzles were too easy but the game was at least entertaining. The publisher is doing themselves a real disservice by saying the game is for 3-8 players as it plays perfectly well solo or with 2 players. There are not enough activities happening at the same time to keep 3 or more people really involved, so it seems like the player count is way off base.

Me gustó más el primero, a pesar de que este es más complicado. Poco inmersivo, traslada la experiencia de escape de forma superficial

Enjoyed this, better and more moving parts than other escape room deck of card games. The nature of some of the puzzles stumped me more than with Stargazer.

RATING: 7
(KIDS) Another quality Escape the Room game that we bought for our family of five to play (ages 8, 10, 13 and mom and dad). It's even a bit better and a bit more challenging than the last one (Stargazer's Manor). We really hope they make more as this one was a great Christmas Day play for all of us.

Enjoyable escape room with an interesting story. The puzzles were good, but my wife and I never really felt that we were too challenged. 
3 people max to play. 
It was fun.

The theme here was a tad darker than stargazers. Had some cool tactile puzzles, and was challenging but not too challenging.

Simple puzzle solving game.  Very easy.  I like that this one has physical (rope) puzzles to solve in addition to the regular logic / position puzzles, but in the end it is just too easy.

This was a fun one. Just remember... don't force the physical puzzles!! Finesse them. Don't bend the cardboard!!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Nice components with the physical puzzles and it looks great. But I found the puzzles lacking and the game far too linear with not enough for multiple people to do but sit around and watch. Plus getting one 90 minute escape where the components are destroyed is not good value. 

I would recommend Escape Room: The Game over this.

RATING: 4
Unhappy with this one, not just because of the "physical" puzzles (is it really a spoiler to say what they're made of??), but because of one of them specifically.  While the rest of the code-wheel puzzles are still pretty easy, or at least on the same level as Stargazer (difficulty is obviously subjective), there is one specific puzzle in this game that has nothing to do with unlocking a barrier (a lock, a door, a chest, etc) to progress forward, at least in the thematic sense.  It actually requires you to mangle it up to the point where even the video demonstration shows that the creators accidentally tore up materials in order to get it solved.  That's just messed up and not conducive to the escape room experience.

Go to any escape room and they will have very specific rules about not brute forcing or damaging any of the stuff in the room(s).  Most of the puzzles in these things are really all about exercising your logic in order to progress.  It's one of the major appeals of doing them in real life.  On the flip side, these physical puzzles that appear in the game are, to me, just artificial padding.  They added a half hour to our experience and the solutions weren't satisfying.  In contrast, even when you get an easy one, you normally feel elated to be past an obstacle in these things because you've worked it out and made your way through - for some reason, at least for us, solving these things gave no such elation.  They made us more upset that we encountered them.  Perhaps it's because of our experiences with the real deal that colored our reactions because we've never been to one that had stuff like this.

I guess the best way to explain it is that normally, if you spend way too much time on a puzzle in a room, you're either thinking about it the wrong way or more likely, you simply don't have enough information to tackle that one and you're best served by moving on and doing something else.  These physical puzzles, however, are self-contained and there is nothing, no hint, no clue on how to do them.  You either figure it out or you don't.  It is, in my not-so-humble opinion, complete bullshit.  They begin to appear half-way through the game and since this series uses the web as its hint-delivery system, if you don't have access to the Internet where you are and you get stuck, you're done.  It's a huge show-stopper.

For that reason alone, I'd recommend you go and do Stargazer instead and forget about this one.  Maybe I'm alone in my feelings on this, but if Think Fun continues to rely on these to pad the length of their games, I'll no longer be playing them.

Un escape room interesante... aunque mucho más sencillo si se compara con EXIT. Vendido.

Really enjoyable family escape room. Not as good as the first, as it has several 'physical' puzzles that can only be attempted by one person at a time, but a good story and lovely components.

Fun cooperative Escape Room game, geared for families, best with groups of 3-4. 

Also own the slightly easier companion: [gameid=193560]

RATING: 7
It delivers an escape-the-room experience and had a reasonable amount of variety in puzzles. We had an enjoyable time playing it and I would happily play another in this series.

If you're reading this before you play, you may want to queue up the hints from the publisher's website in case you get stuck on the physical puzzles. There's one that's exceptionally hard.

RATING: 5.5
Our family very much enjoyed the Mystery at the Stargazer's Manor (rated it an 8), but this one less so. We didn't like the physical string puzzles at all: We couldn't solve any of them, and after looking up the answers online, we still almost tore the cardstock in implementing them. The other puzzles were OK, but overall they seemed less amenable to a group effort. If this had been the first entry in the series, I wouldn't have bought the second, but as it is, if there's a third, we'll probably still try it.

RATING: 8
When compared to live escape room experience, it was quite fun, taking full advantage of being able to build a better, more linear story than a live experience.  We quite enjoyed it.  When compared to board games, of course, there is no replayability. Nevertheless, it was one of the more engaging 1.5 hours of playing we've experienced.

The darker theme is less appealing than the previous one in the series.  

For (possible soiler alert) the part here multiple tasks need to be solved, it is a pity that they need to be solved in a specific order, rather than being independent.

This one was a bit darker than the first one.  I played with my family (wife, daughter who is 10, and son who is 7).  we are very careful about what we let our kids watch, so others may not think the same as us.  We enjoyed the mystery at stargazer's manor better, because it wasn't so "scary".

A somewhat dark escape room game that is both riveting and bizarre.....

RATING: 7
The single play nature of these is surely a problem for some gamers.  But I appreciate the re-usability of the game by someone else and the price point.  Those two things make these games worth it.  AND I can say our gaming group of family & friends really enjoyed working together to puzzle things out.

Step up from Stargazer's Manor.  Still on the easy end, but the added dexterity puzzles where a good challenge.  We finished in just under 90 minutes and that was with 3 children adding a healthy level of distraction so the suggested timer lengths are still too long.

It was fun, I played it with my wife and kids and we ended up finishing it. I wouldn't suggest playing it with more than 3-4, probably 3, there are several times that one or two people work on a puzzle and the other ones are left out. If you like escape rooms, it is definitely worth getting.

After being encouraged by the reception of Stargazer's Manor, I played this with two work colleagues and we were all somewhat underwhelmed: it's similar to its predecessor, a little harder overall, but there were some puzzles which could only be worked on by one player at a time and one late puzzle which - to us - felt like its solution was not well reasoned. We were all a little deflated by this one, especially after really enjoying Stargazer's.

I do appreciate the approach to puzzles in this game. While it is obviously done in cardboard I feel like some of the things this game does could actually occur in a real escape room, and I can not say that much about the other systems. That being said, I think I like this system the least. Every other system does things a bit better than this one. This game is replayable and is not consumable, but the repacking is such a pain it may not be worth the effort.

This was a vast improvement over the first game (which was also very good). This game offered some new dexterity-based puzzles that I though were very smart! We did not solve this room in time but the answer was right under our nose the whole time lol... Awesome!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
2nd Escape room game in the Think Fun range, and this one definately seemed a little more challanging, mainly with the latter physical puzzles (a gentle touch needed?).

Anyway another winner for me and looking forward to more, although they may need to change the difficulty/format slightly to stop these becoming too samey?

A *very* good family level escape challenge in your own home. Played with Sam (16), Sophie (14), Emma & me (adults). We allowed ourselves a time limit of 105mins and finished with 10mins to spare. Everyone solved something and got to feel important and enjoy a feel good moment which was really important to ensure everyone was engaged and invested. The variety of puzzles is good given the constraints of the format of the game (Ie.... a boardgame!). I found it to be a really good experience and look forward to trying out its predecessor and any new titles that are subsequently released.....

This is such a fun game.  It has just the right amount of challenge.  Know that once you play it, it's done.  It is not replayable but certainly worth the price for the experience.  I will play more of these for sure.

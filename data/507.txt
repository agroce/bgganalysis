Interesting game I've 'apparently'* played before in a different incarnation.
Better bidding indicators are needed. Those little sheets of paper just don't do it.
But I'll try it again.

Dry as all get-out, but dang if doesn't work.  I much prefer this to the longer and deadlier Schoko & Co.

*** UPDATE [initial rating: 8.5, new rating: 7.5]

It's been awhile since I'd played, and I'd forgotten that there can be a real runaway leader problem every now and then - which is what happened tonight.  Still, I'm fond of this solid game.

I own the Dallas version, and this is a great game.  I love the tension, I love the fact of being able to interfere with peoples strategy, and I love the gaming bonus system.

Great Game!

An excellent tactical German-style game, produced long before the Euro flood.  We don't find it overly random or luck based with repeated plays.

I've played a few times now and I've got to admit I quite like it in spite of the blind bidding.  I absolutely love the money/stock/debt management aspects, especially how the stock value is tied to the board play and how agonizing it is to sacrifice your precious stock to buy more businesses.

A bit of luck in the card draw, but not too bad.

The bits need a serious upgrade.

Luck of the draw plays too large a part in this game for me to enjoy it more than I do.  It's ok, but I definitely won't seek out a game.  Novel for it's time, to be sure.

Very good buisness game (I actually have "Dallas" which is the same game except with action cards which you don't have to use).  There's a variant I've seen (in Sumo?) to ensure everyone starts out on an equal footing (make sure everyone has a pair of connected properties) which I think would make the game even better.

Una revision al diseño grafico del juego no le vendria mal, aparte de eso el juego esta bien, el tema de las subastas simultanea le da su toque y saber equilibrar tus deudas con tus mercancias es vital, lamentablemente es otro de esos juegos muy abstractos para mi gusto... mas en este caso cuando el diseño grafico es tan austero.

RATING: 6
This is a decent stock market game, way ahead of its time for an American title.  The main tension is around issuing shares: do I issue shares now to buy companies or do I save them for victory points?  The problem is company deeds are distributed to players randomly, so luck plays a major role here.  If you don't get the deeds you want, you'll pay a premium for them at auction or you may never get them at all if other players decide to keep them in their hands.  0-1

Has some interesting features, but if you're unlucky, the game becomes uninteresting.  I don't mind if bad luck makes me lose, but if it makes me bored, I object.

Wow.  Not often I believe the hype.  I do for this game.  An excellent game which doesn't take very long.  The balancing act between corporation values, cash, shares and bonds keeps things interesting until the end.  This game definitely deserves a reprint in a nicer edition!

Definitely one of the stronger games to come out of the 70s. Has a slight [gameid=5] feel although you aren't ever taking over other Cartels. There's certainly some fortune in how the cards come out but it works as an economic family game.

Let's start at 7. Way ahead of it's time, much better than most games from 1970s. The financial system is interesting. Have to play more. Some usability issues (those dollar signs are going to get replaced by cubes), some issues with luck of the draw, but overall rather pleasant. The design is gorgeous, particularly the company logos.

Suggest.

Dallas version (which fortunately makes little reference to the TV show). Marred a bit by the luck of the draw, but still a fun game. I like how success in this game depends on how carefully you manage the interaction of your three sources of income: cash, bonds, and stock. Often this requires some timely patience, particularly early in the game. [5 plays]

Surprisingly good business game. I recently got a copy of Cartel and played 4 times so far with both 3 and 4. It is very challenging and different group has different dynamics of the game. Hard to believe that it is from 1974. I play with the variant that tie-break for the secret bidding is clockwise starting from active player and starting player changes to the left person for each round.

RATING: 8
In the mid-70's gaming landscape no durable alternative to Acquire was available, since other economic games were either too simple or too obscure, so Cartel came in to fill this gap. Acquire was the obvious source of inspiration, but only few of its elements were present here, and if at all altered (territorial control but with the companies fixed on the board, shares sold by players instead of bought); adding some original mechanisms as well (limited number of turns, auctions, payments via bonds) made Cartel even more distinct.

Together with these innovations there are unfortunately several caveats: the luck of the draw can be massive (in fact since the very start of the game, with players getting different profits for chains of the same value), there is a huge runaway problem lurking behind every corner (if a player throws down the gauntlet and carries out a very big purchase the others must follow suit as soon as possible if they don't want to struggle against the daring player's ballooning profits), and auctioning is a very exciting double-edged sword that doesn't quite work on the two-player game.

These itchy spots don't ruin the game, luckily - despite its occasional big strokes of luck, Cartel offers a frenzied race for benefits with the very reasonable duration of 60-90 minutes in which audacious play is usually rewarded.

Players are holding groups that go around buying company's shares and trying to achieve profits with the consortia that they build up.  The ultimate strategy game.  It has auctions, lots of bluffing, crucial decitions and the right dose of randomness.  It was for sure way ahead from its time.

Everytime I play this game I feel it has potential, but rarely seems to be terribly enjoyable, yet I often want to come back for more.  Not sure I can effectively judge this game because of this.  Note:  I have the Dallas:  Game of Empire Building Strategy version.

The determinant of victory in this game is to a large extent card draws. Card draws can doom a player to a game of forced options.

box is pretty beat up (split and minor crush damage). I am missing 5 player markers (these are plastic dollar signs - missing 2 gold, 1 silver, 1 red, and 1 crimson) and I am missing the little score sheets (you will have to print up your own copies from files here in the downloads section - its basically a couple of lines to keep your score and they are disposable like Yahtzee score pads). There is no component list but I count 52 company cards, 5 each denomination of bond 10, 25, 50 and 125 for a total of 20 bonds. 36 cartel stock blocks - 9 each of gold, ebony, ivory, crimson. There is also lots of play $$$ in various denominations.  Certainly playable, but not a collector's edition.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Brilliant concept, and really ahead of its time.  It truly is a vanguard game.  But it also suffers from serious problems.  There is a huge luck problem where drawing the right cards has far more to do with you position than most of your actions.  There is an unstoppable rich get richer problem, that allows for them to outbid those that don't have their purchasing power, so the poor are helpless against them.  It is nearly impossible to catch up without extreme luck. The static turn order gives an advantage to the players going last.

That said, the game is enjoyable, and the logos are gorgeous.  It really needs someone to clean it up.

I'd say that the easiest way to improve this game is that you can't ever buy from your hand, you buy from the open board and you play cards down on them after you win a bid or flush your hand.  You don't have a first player you just play your turn and adjust your stock at the end.  When you build next to people you split the total adjacency bonus with the other player rounded down.

First play for all of us, so we suffered from the Dallas rules error where the starting hand wasn’t mentioned, and we had to figure it out by inference. The game itself was great, although it suffers in a few production/usability areas from its age: writing down bids; company tokens essentially invisible when placed on the board. I wish a modernised version could be produced.

A gem for its age. A few rules to realize a solid economical game that can be played in one hour. It should be fixed with a bit of house rules, anyway it's a nice discover from the past.

I had always wondered why this game landed on the grail lists. Just didn't seem like anything all that special really. I got to play it when a friend of mine got his grail hit and man oh man do I like this game. It's loads of fun. Crazy bidding, tense moments of waiting for your turn, calculations. Man I want to play this one again REAL soon. 

I own the "Dallas" version of this game which comes in a typical 80's style long box which is unfortunate as I liked the small box of Cartel. Still the game is exactly like the original including even using some of the exact same company logo's. In addition there is an event deck that can be optionally added to the game. I tend to like event decks in games...well modern games at least. In older games they tend to suck so I'll have to look at these cards before I determine if I want to use them or not.

Great for 1973, but I find the auction mechanism too brittle.  Losing one auction early seems to put you behind on the economic growth curve, without much compensation.

This ancestor of [thing=3528]Priceless[/thing] has a broader playfield than [thing=3528]Priceless[/thing], so the odds of getting your purchases clumped together is significantly lower.  Since the ancestor of the chaining bonus is the adjacency bonus (2 adjacent companies gets you one printed bonus; 4 adjacent gets you the four bonuses between the pairs, plus a fifth bonus), the sparsity of the spaces is both less troubling and more.

The insidious mechanism of the finite stock options (ancestor of the checks) whose values increase as your portfolio does – and of course, how can you afford to acquire companies, other than clever bartering and spending the aforementioned stock options? – provides for a pleasant agony in deciding the course of your actions.

I would like to play this some more to get into its groove - a task made more difficult, I think, by its being so similar to Priceless (well, vice versa).

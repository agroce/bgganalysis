goes very well with Fallen Eagles. Again I am an ACW gamer but these two Hexasim games model classic battles quite well.

Best Austerlitz game for those who find Napoleon's triumph too abstract
Fog of war adds a lot

(Component rating only). Fantastic components. Probably some of the best counters I've ever seen. The map does a nice job of rendering terrain elevations. Need a play.

There is a lot to like in this game system, particularly if you're looking to learn about the battles and explore overall strategies.  The rules are clear and well written, not as complex as some Napoleonic games at this battalion/regimental scale, but still including reasonable renditions of all the major effects of combined arms during that era.  Game play focuses more on the top two levels of command, overall commander setting corps mission and corps commanders maneuvering units, rather than going all the way down to details of unit facing that would be handled by Lieutenant Colonels and Majors.  Orders are issued at corps level and are fairly broad brush, as seems to be typical of Napoleonic game systems.  Formation activation alternates between players, but with a fair amount of uncertainty due to corps commander initiative failure and the strong possibility of premature turn end, particularly latter in the game (reflecting unit exhaustion?). This limited and uncertain activation makes prioritization crucial.  One novelty is that formations can activate twice per turn.  The details of the activation procedure are set up elegantly to limit combat and tactical maneuvering, but not approach marches. 

The whole game system reflects this elegant simplicity, each element set up the simplest way that still gives a realistic feel and effect.  Both troop and leader quality impact performance in fairly standard manner.  The fog of war is simple, but practical using decoy units for leaders and having the "hidden" troops only appear when the real leader approaches the enemy.  Overall, I found the system easier to get the hang of than most Napoleonic games, despite the significant combined arms aspects.  I'd rate the game even higher if I were a real Napoleonics fan, but then I'd probably want something more complex.  The game plays out in a day and places far higher demands on command orchestration then rule memorization.  It is fairly well balanced, but really rewards skill, particularly on the French side.  Not being Napoleon, I lost to the Coalition!

There is also the option of strategic and tactical card play, if you're into that sort of thing.  I note that cards, like elan, died out soon after the invention of the machine gun.  They're fairly common in musket era games, but relatively rare in later eras.  I have no idea what this implies about war or wargamers.

The game materials are really nice.  The pieces are easy to punch and come with pre-rounded corners for those who loath those fuzzy little corner tails.  The setup/loss record cards are a great aid at both start and end of game.  The interesting "period" map is highly functional and, wonder of wonders, doesn't stretch if you tape it down in a humid environment.  The two rule books are glossy and lavishly illustrated with examples.

Played on 2 December 2017 in Paris. Napoleon cannot really lose this battle and he was coordinating the assault on Pratzenberg at 11 A.M. 

The game is fun for both players. With most units hidden at start, surprises can happen. The Austro Russian can be very agressive and there is sufficient incentive to do so.

I have ordered this on the strength of HEXASIM's other games such as Napoleon against Europe and Falling Eagles and I am not disappointed. Rating is based on other two, but will update it after a couple of plays. Updated to a 10

RATING: 6
Straightforward combat system, route and retreat rules to be carved, to say the least, command chain overly and uselessly convoluted. And most importantly: where are cavalry charges? A pity and a shame.

Quite funny nevertheless

Austerlitz 1805: Rising Eagles [2nd volume of the “Eagles” series – 2 two-sided maps]; 2016; Hexasim; Walter Vejdovsky; Artists: Barber, Brunel, Gentil-Perret; Napoleonic Era (1805).

RATING: 9
A very good game.
The fog of war rules makes it even better.
The components are beautiful, the map is stunning, with it's stern winter looking and it s relief depiction.
Gameplay is a  nail's biting affair, a plan must be made without knowing where the enemy corps are  and what he is planning to do,  each activation  could  path the way to Victory or doom your hopes of it.
Russo Austrian allies  and French players will Attack and defend, in a wonderful  maneuver battle, 
Timing is everything, suspense is everywhere.

Ok, I'm in the Credits, so I may be not well suited to give my opinion on this game...but it is amazing. One of the most challenging games I ever played. For once you can have fun with the Coalition and be offensive in a very tense game of swifteness. I also think that this game, more than any game before, well depicts the amazing quality of the 1805 French army and its large tactical superiority over any other army of this era. 
Also fond of the new cavalry special rules. They are so great to play with and have a very special historical feeling about them.
Plus it can be played in just 6-7 hours : if the coalition player made it all out for sudden death victory, you'll know by the end of turn 1300 who won and who lost ^^
Looking forward to play the next game in the series.

I have been playing war games since 1969 and this title is one of the best 'battle' games that I have ever seen. That includes all time periods. The 'orders' system is superb and it would be  great to 'retro-fit' this system to all kinds of other 'battle' games. This would be perfect for a 'Gettysburg' game. It is also shows that a 'monster' game can be designed that is perfectly playable. Excellent, excellent.

Haven't been able to sit down with this game yet. I bought this because I got Waterloo 1815: Fallen Eagles which the first game in this series and I really liked the graphics and the rules (which I haven't quite finished yet). So when this was announced for preorder I jumped at the chance to get it.

GAME: Tikal
RANK: 214

RATING: 8
I have limited experience but, here are my thoughts so far;

Seems a little lighter than weighted after you 'catch-on' - more like a 2.5 maybe? Fun and replayable. Good-looking too. Balanced with a good mix of choices, blocking tactics, area take-over tactics with a definite beginning, middle and end with changing strategy throughout. Suffers from a little AP. Experienced players could probably beat the 120 minute time listed.

My copy seems to have been published by Ravensburger.

Still one of the best 'action point' games. The tile draw makes it a bit too luck oriented for this weight of game so play with the auction variant even though it adds to the game length a bit.

This game deservingly won all of the major game awards (SdJ, DSP, IGA).  It combines an outstanding theme, highly innovative mechanic (action points), has very good components, and has excellent scalability (works exceptionally well with 2, 3, or 4 players).  You even have the option of making it lighter/more luck driven (random, blind flipping of tiles) or MUCH more strategic (bidding for tiles, the only method I ever use).  This is a must-own for any serious game collection.

Traded.

UPDATE--no idea when I would ever play this game these days.

Traded Thurn and Taxis for it in the 2nd CABS Math Trade.  Should get it when I visit Brad for Origins!  [update] Played only once so far, apparently with the national champion at Buckeye Game Fest '07.  We didn't get to finish it, but he was certainly going to win!  I liked it--the 10 action points really didn't seem to cause as much AP as I feared/was warned about, but then we didn't really make it to the last round, either.

A solid game to have in your collection when you're looking for something with a lot of thinking for your turn.  Lots of interesting decisions to be made.  The strategy here seems a tad harder to grasp than other games.  Have not played the auction version.

Tikal is a very interesting game, and beautiful as well. I think Mexica edges this one out a bit due to it's more fluid nature. Tikal felt more choppy in play. I'll keep playing this one (but not late at night) because it is a very good game. I don't think it'll become a great game though, at least not for me. UPDATE: I recommend that each player draws their next tile to lay at the end of their turn, rather than the beginning of their next turn. That way they have an entire round to consider where they will place their tile. This is similar to house rules for Carcassonne, and I believe it greatly speeds up the game.

1 play / 4 players (2h)

LIKE: well designed with a lot of tension. I like the intermediate scoring, which adds a lot of interaction for temple control.
DISLIKE: the non-auction version of play is too luck dependent. the game can get a little cutthroat with some blocking and runaway leader.
OVERALL: fun, tactical game with good ideas. It's interesting how the scoring works where multiple players can score a temple in a row, and opt to build on to it. I like how as the jungle is explored, the better temple tiles come out, which fits the theme well. Many moving inter-connected parts. The auction variant and other two-player variants are a must.

I really enjoyed this one, but I'd *never* play it with an AP-prone player. The theme wins here plus the components. The actions make sense as do the scoring systems - I was delighted by it even though I didn't come close to winning. Well deserving of Spiel des Jahres in 1999. But somehow it doesn't fit in my collection.

Played a couple of times and liked it, need to play more, especially with the tile auction variant

After a couple more plays I've gone off the system a bit, the 10 action points tends to create a bit too much AP and the area control nature of the game now puts me off.

I didn't feel the auction variant added enough control or interest for the extra time investment

I thought that the old version of the game had a beautiful board and pieces. It probably was the first game that I bought just because of the pictures at BGG. However, I found the new version with resin temples even more appealing and I trade away the old version and bought the new one.
The game itself it is fun but it can be quite slow with people with AP. This is probably the main reasons it does not come out more often.

In the Tikal board game you are the director of an expedition negotiating the myriad paths through the jungle. Your expedition leader and his team following your every step. On your journey you discover temples long lost from the memory of humankind. These temples are excavated and the treasure troves nearby unearthed. During the four scoring rounds of the game you are rewarded handsomely with victory points for the treasures you have and for the temples that you control. The expedition that wins the most points is the winner.

Hrm.  I like the AP system, the actions.  I enjoy the tile placement, the choice of treasure/temple pursuit, how to set up to do well in scoring.  The theme's nice, I like exploring the ancient ruins, jungle feel, etc.

The actual volcano-based scoring seems to give a random advantage to someone and feels weird and inelegant.  Also, most importantly, the game is [b]LONG[/b] for what it is.  We'll try with one of the "shrink it down" variants, and might play occasionally with that.  Without, I don't think I feel like taking the time.

UPDATE:  Ok, with instant-scoring to make it shorter + less forgiving of poor worker placement, and removal of nine tiles it becomes a 30-40 minute game with a good bit of tension, interesting decisions, and a nice board.  Not a favorite, but quite enjoyable!

A very nice exploration game by the dynamic duo of Kramer and Kiesling! Easy to learn but with deep thinking how to use your 10 actions every round.

The new edition of Super Meeple is the way to go with its quality components, especially the 3D temples!

It's a fine game. The AP is there, but I don't think it's necessarily a huge problem. Keeping track of the action points was sort of a bigger deal. And then that everything stops for the scorings is another matter.

I like that you can take a bunch of small, incremental actions to establish yourself, but then you need the big expensive actions in order to really secure your position (set up a camp, guard a temple, uncover a temple, grab a treasure) and so it's a matter of trying to time things so that you can get those actions at the best time (e.g. guarding a temple without losing half your researchers).

It looks beautiful and it's nice the way that the terrain sort of organically emerges.

Excellent game, both to play, and to look at. Good action point movement system, and a chance for some wicked opportunism. There's no room for polite play, as you do whatever is neccesary to discover and improve temples, unearth treasures, and do your damndest to pinch temples from the other players, who are all trying to do the same to you. Someones gonna end up shafted!
I went looking for this game after it had good reviews, and I wasn't dissapointed. It helps that I often win!

I've now played this classic twice in the past month after owning it for over 10 years without a single play.  It uses a variation of the standard area control mechanic.  Both plays used the bidding mechanic, which usually gives me a advantage as I'm typically very good at assessing value and almost never over-bid.  Without it, however, might render the game too random since the ability to select the right tile can make or break your game.  The game itself is very beautiful, and while fairly abstract, the theme is very well integrated.

Although it dates back to 'the medieval times of boardgames', it sure plays nice! It's fun game to play, although I feel it is a bit unbalanced with the artifacts. I think a change in rules might help this when you can only dig up one artifact each turn. Or make it more expensive, like 4 actions in stead of 3.
Still, a fun game though!

A "solve the puzzle" feeling to this game with a very pleasing explore the jungle theme.  The scoring mechanic, wherein each person moves his pieces in the scoring round then scores only his position feels weird, original and ultimately interesting, very much underscoring the puzzle versus competition duality that is inherent in this classic. It is a puzzle (solve it!)...no, it is a competition (compete!). It's both.

I've played Tikal quite a few times. I'm always a fan of the action point mechanic. But this particular game doesn't remain fun forever. There's just something about it I can't put my finger on. I've played online and in person and something about the game is just slightly irksome.

Interesting mix of resource management and competitive strategy. Scoring happens every few rounds, so  you need to plan ahead by building up the board, temples and gathering treasures to maximise points whilst all the while working around your competitors who are doing the same. 

When scoring round arrives temples quickly change hands in order to maximise the points gathered and make it more challenging for the opponnent to do so.

Fantastic medium weight abstract/euro. The components are ascetically extremely appealing. The game can be a little dependent on the luck factor with 2-player games. **My copy of this game didn't have the directions and so when I finally got the directions I found out I had been playing this game incorrectly. These are the 3 differences : When a volcano tile is drawn each player scores. Without the before and after actions. The 2nd difference was unlimited temple guards. 3rd we didn't take explorers out of the game if on the same tile when a temple guard was being placed.** Now that I have the directions I still play the way I used to without the rules listed above.

RATING: 8.5
While semi-abstract in play, Tikal has an elaborate and gorgeous theme of jungle exploration. One of the best produced games on thje market. There's a great combination of shafting your neighbour by trumping their excavations, good resource management and the need to be aware of the timing for scoring. Works best with the "advanced" auction system. Also, a really, really good 3-player game. One of the few.

Good stuff here.  Hard to explain why it's good because the game changes from exploration to stealing the good points.  It's sort of press-your-luck in front of everyone, so they can take advantage of you.

Theme fits - exploring Mayan pyramids (which you actually build on the board as you play) and you have to choose between further exploration and protecting your discoveries from others.

Despite all the rave, and strong ratings for this game, I didn't take to it.  I guess at this point it just feels like another german style game, with nothing terribly unique to offer.  And on that note, the game play is too long, for the type of game it is.  And the Action Point resources it uses is out of place.  But, worst of all the exciting theme feels really just pasted on, it's not that that is per say bad.  But in my opinion a theme may be pasted but it should at least feel as if the player is engaging in the type of thinking, for the theme.  In the end I just feel like a greedy victory point junky.

It seemed like I could do anything in this game and get victory points.  No matter what I did, I felt like I would be in the mix for the win at the end, and I was, despite not understanding half the rules.

Tentative rating after one play.  Really like this game.  I think that because of the exploration aspect that it may be fun for younger folks as well.  Brutal competition for resources with a nice theme.  Plays well with two as long as players are willing to engage in direct conflict.  If you each go to your own side of the board there's not much point.  It certainly deserves it's game of the year for 1999.

I think that the sweet spot may be 3 players. Four may be a little too crowded.

Wonderful classic game. Love the concept of "exploring" and creating new paths through the jungle. Paths get a bit hard to see by the time the end game rolls around. Lovely presentation.
On the negative side, most turns are hard to plan in advance, and point-optimization calculations during scoring rounds can cause quite some delays, which makes the entire game drag just a wee bit.

Tikal. Player are expedition crews exploring the ruins of the Mayan city of Tikal, trying to uncover Temple floors and collect sets of treasures. On their turn, player have ten action point, which they spend to various things. Points are score in four stages, three during the game and one at end.

I generally liked it. It's fairly easy to learn and it does have a lot strategy in play. My biggest complaint is its action point system, which while does drive a lot of the action, can be hard to keep track of at times.

A very good game. The action points are always short, ensuring you use them well, or risk to lose. Unfortunately this is a drawback with most players, as the turn angst can be a nuisance at best, and a fun-stopper at worst. With the right group of gamers, though, the game shines.

UPDATE: How I hate AP! Rating dropped from 7 to 6 for this issue.

UPDATE: When was the last time you really "wanted it to end"? And did that happen with a PBeM style of game? I can't believe how much I hated this one the last time I tried it. If I don't downgrade it's rating any further is just because I remember I used to somehow like it. Down to a 4.

UPDATE: Ok, granted. It's not *that* bad... but still, quite boring, and AP makes it hell. Definitely not for me. Up to a 5, because the design is quite fine and all... it's just not that fun.

RATING: 7
Tikal is one of the most visualy appealing games I own.  It's one of the few games in my collection that has both strategic depth and is thematicaly very strong.  It's very satisfying to watch the jungle start to clear away as you explore the game board --  To see the temples begin to emerge from the map as more and more people uncover them -- and to watch the regions fill up with more and more explorers running around searching for treasure and glory.

It's true that the game can be a tad slow between turns and players can be stuck for long periods of time trying to work out their best possible move.  But these weaknesses are more than made up for by the overall design and presentation.

RATING: 7.5
+ Great action allowance game. 
+ You start with a green board (jungle) and when you've cleared the jungle, the board looks fantastic.

What a beautiful game! I'm almost tempted to get this game simply for the artwork. WOW. Game play is exciting, if somewhat similar to Kramer's other action point system games. Still have to try the auction variant which will probably make the rating go up.

Update (2006-11-29): I've still yet to play the auction vairant but I'm starting to find the basic version a bit frustrating due to the tile draw. Dropped my rating down to 7 from 8.

Update (2006-12-19): Finally played the auction variant and this is definitely the way to play the game. You get what you pay for and you get some added tactical elements due to the ability to bid for turn order. Turns a 7-8 rated game to and 8-9 rated game, for me. Will refrain from playing the basic version, unless playing with newbies.

Már régóta érett, hogy kipróbáljam ezt a (mondhatjuk?) klasszikust. Nem bántam meg, tetszett! A rövid és designos szabályfüzet, meg a 10+ alapján családi játékra számítottam, de szerintem ez inkább gémer játék. Nem túl komplex, de azért agyalós. A szabály egyébként nagyon egzakt, (a falualapításnál szerintem kicsit hibás, de lehet hogy csak a magyarban írták el). A játék elsőre rendkívül kiegyensúlyozottnak tűnt! Az első 3 értékelésnél max 3 pont különbség volt, és nem mindig ugyanaz vezetett. A végén ment csak 10 fölé a difi. A kincseknél és lapkáknál van szerepe a szerencsének, de kincses játéknál ez belefér. Nagyon igényes a kivitelezés is, összességében megérte kipróbálni, máskor is játszanék vele, sőt a 2. rész is érdekelne:)
---
Majd ki akarjuk próbálni a haladót, mert a teljesen random lapkahúzogatás azért elég igazságtalan tud lenni. Ha vulkánt húz valaki, az inkább szívás, ha kincses lapkát, az inkább jó, de azért helyzetfüggő is a dolog.
---
Tényleg jobb a haladó, de a kezdőt is szívesen játszom, csak az úgy családibb. Kipróbáltuk időközben a mini tikal játékváltozatot is. Lemegy 25 perc alatt, de az előkészület és elpakolás is legalább annyi. Nekem kicsit talál túl rövid is így a parti.

It took me almost 10 years since I started gaming to try this classic, but it was absolutely worth it.  Tikal plays with relatively easy rules, but offers great depth, looks really great as the game progresses, and allows realy nasty movements.

Just great, it deserves its fame.

Shame on me for having waited to try this classic so long. It is a very straightforward action points game, with a small dose of luck (although I hear it is mitigated in the auction variant), and (thanks to the gorgeous components) a very thematic feel.
What is amazing is the elegance of the design, that gives the game an almost gateway feel (still it is surprising a gamer's game like this won SdJ a while ago!).
The only problem I see is the potential downtime between turns, as players prone to analysis paralysis take their actions. Anyway, it is certainly one of the best action points games around, plays wonderfully even with 2, and has the most useful box insert I ever saw in a boardgame!

Auction version is my prefered style of play.  The basic version of tile drawing is more luck dependent and works best for new players and non-gamers.  Tikal is the least "developed" of the Kramer action point games.  Innovative design... but the later offerings are much better.  I prefer Tikal with 2 players.  Although I dislike the random Treasure Draw, I do enjoy the camps, palace guards and volcanos.

A great thinking game, with lots to analyze. The theme is well done too, with the feeling of exploration as new tiles are laid and the forest cleared, or larger temples discovered. Chance has a minor role in this one. The auction variant minimizes further the role of chance and is still fun to play.

Thematic but depends too much on luck. The draw of the temple/treasure tiles will decide who wins. Didn't try the optional auctioning of the tiles to mitigate this. (D)

[i]Posted: 9/20/05, Rated: 7[/i]
{2P: 7, 3P: 7, 4P: ???}

Since I am a new inductee to "Euro" games, I am always interested to discover a mechanic in a game that is new to me.  With [i]Tikal,[/i] that mechanic is found in the way that the tiles are shuffled together.  This is the first time that I have seen such a method for adding some structure to a random deck.

I am still learning when it comes to tile placement: sometimes I want the jungle to be very fluid, connecting to as many different spaces as possible so that I can take advantage of my opponents' activities.  At other times, I want to make movement very costly, or even block off a portion of the jungle altogether so that my opponents can't benefit from my own efforts.  These thoughts can seriously slow down tile placement.

There are four scoring opportunities during the game.  When one occurs, each player gets ten "action points" to move her units around the table, capturing treasures or uncovering temples to maximize her score.  This process really grinds the game to a halt, as each player attempts to find the optimal actions that score the most points.

Tikal is a very enjoyable game with a great theme.  It also offers occasional turns of crushing analysis paralysis (AP), and for this reason I do not think it has been as well received by my family as [i][gameid=9209][/i].

I have owned this for over a year but only played twice on SBW. The experience leaves me cold. There is no real strategy to consider waiting for your turn as the other players will no doubt move the goal posts. When it gets to my turn the optimal moves seem evident. I can see no grounds for negotiation or interaction. Tile draw seems to inject a significant degee of luck.

The game would seem ideal for the number cruncher, but ftf the downtime on this is potentially huge with those prone to AP.

With 75% down time with 4 players and no real long term planning practical, again I struggle to appreciate this games appeal and the high BGG ranking beyond the high production value. Perhaps it's a good one with children?

RATING: 9
The first time I played this game today I won.  We played 2 players and I really enjoyed it.  There are many options for play (but not too many), though with two players there is not much room for large shifts in points.  I jumped ahead early and the other player could never catch up.  I was able to secure a corner of the board with my explores and ended up having 1 person in each hex on 5 and 6 point pyramids.

RATING: 9
Have only played once so my feelings are still unsure.  I had a lot of fun playing and the theme was really easy to get into (the components are fantastic which adds a lot to this feeling).  It seemed that random draw had a lot to do with who won.  Getting good pieces set up some players for success or pulling the volcano at the right time really effected who scored well.  I would like to try the auction variant as I imagine this would fix these problems.  Overall it was still really fun and pretty! 

***
After additional plays I have come to really appreciate this game.  Having the auction variant removes almost all luck from the game (still random selection of treasure) and it adds an interesting dynamic of knowing how much to spend for a given tile.

This game has gotten better with time and it is one of my favorites. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Very good game.  It's light strategy and easy rules can lure in non gamers.  It's not until the first scoring phase do they realize that they have been duped into playing a  (lite)strategy game!  Mwa ha ha ha!  Then it is too late.  They're hooked. :)  I recommend it.

A good strategic game, but I will concede that it's pretty dry.  Not a good one for light or non-gaming friends, and there's not a lot of interaction.  A bit more chess-like in its play than other Euro-games.  But if you've got a competitive group to play with, this is not a bad choice.  Some games can be crippled by AP, though.

RATING: 8
A Kramer and Kiesling classic. While this game may not be for everyone it is certainly the best of the mask trilogy. The base game has a little to much luck for my taste but the advanced game fixes that by adding a bit of bidding into the mix. Game is a mix of tile laying and action point allowance. Mainly the last bit means it can be a pain to play this with AP prone people. But otherwise this makes for a nice medium weight euro with lots of meaningful decisions and back and forth between the players. Gorgeous production. Higly recommended!

I sought this game out simply because it was a Spiel des Jahres winner, even though I didn't have the highest expectations, but I was surprised how much I enjoyed it. This is actually a really neat game. I was a little nervous about how the action point system might lead to analysis-paralysis with the wrong players, but it wasn't too bad. Since so many of the actions (especially later in the game) chomp up large chunks of your action points, players end up only taking a few actions on their turn. I like that there are multiple strategies to explore, and every turn you have to make a tough decision about which actions will benefit you the most. The exploration theme is sweet and it is actually very unique compared to other games in my collection. I've only played the basic game so far, but I'm not sure that the advanced game is necessary, it seems good enough as it is. My one complaint would be that the game seems just a little long. I think if we get a few games under our belts it will go quicker, though.

Tikal is a nearly perfect blend of strategic thinking and tactical movement.  Every single game is engrossing and challenging, and it just keeps getting better with every play.  One of my favorites. 

Oh, and screw the auction variant.  I like the luck of the draw.  You don't know what you'll find exploring the jungle, why should you get to choose what you get?  A misguided attempt to further "Euro-ize" the game, all it does is slow things down.

The game is okay.  I'm just not good at it.  Maybe I focus too much on the treasure tokens & idols... and I'm always too worried about opponents stealing temples that I have worked hard to excavate.  I need to play with a timer, otherwise I agonize & my turns take forever.

RATING: 7.5
A game that is simple to learn and enjoyable to play. Bidding for tile placing, the tile placing itself, temple excavating and capping, artifact claiming and trading, seems like a lot, but it fits well and the handout which at first glance looks quite confusing actually starts to make sense pretty quickly!

I really enjoyed this game on the first play, so I got a copy off ebay.

I may be a little harsh with this rating - the game has lovely production values and the theme is quite attractive. But it's just so slooooooow with 4 players. Min/maxing is rampant and while each player is having their turn there is essentially nothing to do.

Based on one face-to-face three player game, I thought this was fun. It felt similar in vibe of weight/fun ratio as El Grande for me. Although easier to explain and follow initially. I have to admit I had little strategy going in and have only picked up on a few hints of it from the game.

I'm hoping to get in some games on Spielbyweb with some friends so I can refine my opinion.

UPDATE: After 1.5 more games on Spielbyweb this one is losing me. So many actions to perform with a large degree of chaos. Especially the opening play seems very random. I mostly feel like I'm sprinkling my guys around hoping I'll hold on to some territory. 
The game doesn't give me any tension until after the mid-point when pieces are more locked down because you're trying to hold up territory in a couple areas of the board. Even then it can feel like I'm just trading temples with other players each scoring round.

Still curious to play with the auction variant.

This game is a big surprise for me! I was curious why through so many years it is so high in rankings. Now I know. It is superb. Works well. You can learn & teach the rules very quickly and in the same time it doesn't mean it is simple gameplay. No. Game is complex and can be tough even for the experienced player. Another plus is the price - game is not expensive and inside the box You will find solid stuff. Playing time? 60-90 minutes, depends on number of players (2-4). Tile placement is similar to Robinson Crusoe.

3, 4 players - cool too ;) 

You can raise difficulty of this game by adding tile auction but I think it is not necessary ;) 

STRONG RECOMMENDATION!

Easily teachable in under ten minutes and then the group should require no more help after that.  This makes it an excellent game for large get togethers where as the host you have to get groups started but not be there to play.

I'd say the game is a little bit more than a filler but at the same time it is a good gateway game.  Light enough to be fun but heavy enough to keep gamers interested.

After 8 in-person plays and a few online plays, I sold this one.  I found that I just wasn't in the mood to play it.  

Downtime, analysis paralysis.  The luck vs. length aspect is kind of irritating.  You can play the basic game and deal with the luck of the tile draws, or you can add the auctions and another 10-30 minutes to the playtime and get rid of a lot of the luck.

Played once FtF (3er) and twice online (1 3er, 1 4er).  This is a really good brainburner.  So many options, and it takes several plays just to get a feel for what you need to be doing.  Very rewarding, with several elements I like (exploring/board creation, area majority, action points), but felt like it was about 30 min. too long.  Hopefully as we get faster, it will feel just about right.

Online (SBW) is a great way to learn, but is difficult to really enjoy because your turns might be a day or two apart - so you have to reinvent your strategy each turn.

Tikal est un site archéologique perdu au milieu de la jungle du nord Guatemala. Enfouie sous des arbres, se cache une cité vieille de 3000 ans. Des expéditions se montent afin de mettre a jour les temples et les trésors encore ensevelis. Est-ce votre équipe qui controlera les temples les plus hauts ?

Games typically run close to 2 hours, but as is said of good games the time is well spent.  A lot of directions to contemplate for the 10 actions that are allowed. Very tactical, even with the auction version, but at the same time need a strategic outlook with regard to placement of camps in the field of play. Might need to play the auction version to even out the tile draws with experienced players, but I still think the game plays well without it. It is very important to place one's camps in a strategic place on the grid to optimize worker placement. This is a gamer's game, and offers repeated plays due to the unknown placement of tiles for each round.

As far as I can remember, this was the first pure action point game I tried. The game itself is interesting, as you try to optimize efficiency and lay the tiles as attacking or defensive moves. However, the game is a bit prone to analysis paralysis and downtime. There is an auction variant to avoid randomness, although it surely makes the game even longer.

Surprisingly, the slowest playing game of the mask trilogy for us. Lots of AP and the game took much longer than anticipated. The lowest rated of the mask trilogy for me; but it is still a good game; one that I would play periodically.
Have played both the regular rules and with the auction rules. Both have their pros and cons.

A very cool theme that relates to the game. It makes you feel like you are exploring the deep jungles of Central America.

Edit:
The basic game is TOTALLY broken. Must play with the auction rules. I've played two 3 player games in which I did not draw a single temple tile and I drew all the volcanoes. BROKEN, BROKEN, BROKEN.

A very attractive game, i have only played it a couple of times so forgive the rating - this may change as I play more.  The reason it doesn't rate as highly as some games is because of the sorts of games I like.  There seems to be so many options, which have so many reprecussions that the game is prove to severe AP.  Most of the time I can live with a reasonable amount of AP, but in Tikal it just agitates me -not sure why!

Fun, thematic exploration game with a deep, mathy core.

Tikal is one of those pillars of Euro design, in this case, the specific contribution being action points.  As far as area control games go (that aren't specifically 2 player), this is one of the best.  There is certainly too much to do and not enough actions, which generates quite a bit of tension.  I enjoy the action point system here more than in the other games that have employed it - I found Torres to be too abstract, while Cavum didn't work so well with 2.  Tikal does it all right, but that said, it does feel a little rusty.  A true classic, but one that will only come out intermittently.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Another excellent Kramer-Kiesling "action-allocation" abstract. The game is much more thematic than their other area control abstracts (Bison: Thunder on the Prairie, for example), and the rules are incredibly intuitive and easy to teach. The pure-information and totally deterministic movement/actions make this still not my favorite type of game, especially as you can sometimes determine the winner a couple of turns before the end of the game, but it does make the game tight and intensely competitive, which I like. Deserving of its "classic" status.

Tikal is one of those games where I actually don't mind the randomness.  The auction version, which sound neat, intimidates me.  I burn my brain just figuring out how to play the original.  With more plays, I can imagine moving on to the auction variant, but I'm not sure.

While it lengthens the game considerably, I really enjoy playing with the auction variant that adds a little more skill to the game.  However, even without the auction Tikal is very enjoyable.

Its a legend for good reason. Being an action point system game you obviously can't do everything in a given turn.  However, unlike many Euros at the end of a turn I'm happy with what I have accomplished and am not angry with the fact that I just wanted to do one more thing but were not able to.  Your given choices and you got to make the best of them, but it doesn't make you feel like no matter what you choose, you could have chosen better. Personal pet peeve of mine.

The first time I played this game I hated it. I must just have been in a bad mood though because when I later begrudgingly agreed to play again, I loved it. There is definitely a "take that" aspect to the game, but overall it's balanced as every character has an equal number of pieces and someone that you just hurt can easily come back and hurt you later.

An excellent medium-light weight game from Wolfgang Kramer. This plays well with either 2, 3, or 4 players and is one of the prettier games in my collection. Even though it's more "fun" than deep I still enjoy it quite a bit and the mechanics support the theme better than most Euro games. It's also probably my best game for introducing non-gamers to the hobby after Settlers of Cataan.

I never really enjoyed Tikal as much as Kramer's other games.  The calculations you need to spend your movement points most efficiently each turn take too long.  Too much effort for the payout.

While I think Tikal was a decent game, it did show sign of its age, and while I would play it again I don’t need to own it. I think it’s an unforgiving game for new players, who will have a hard time playing well in this game; at least that was what happened in my first game. We were two new players against an experienced one, and looking back we made a ton of bad decisions (but I was actually close to winning; I still don’t understand how)! It is not wise to have a lot of people standing in remote areas, and the importance of a new camp around the middle became quite obvious after our first play… 

What was good about Tikal was that it was a rather fast and didn’t have nearly as much AP as I had heard. The best part of the game was probably the “3” person as that guy can really mess up your opponents plans! The ability to lock a temple was quite neat too as was the spatial element; while it wasn’t the main part of the game, clever placement of the drawn tiles is essential to win. But this was perhaps one of the major downsides of the game; the luck of the draw. 

Yes, I have played with the non-auction variant both times as we didn’t know the game and knew which tiles would come up and what the value of them were etc. In my next games I am definitely going to play with the auction variant, as the tiles you randomly draw can vary a lot in terms of usefulness and give one player a big advantage (if he constantly draws good temple tiles while somebody else constantly draws blank tiles). In addition, it is random when scoring occurs (you only know approximately when), and this can give a player an advantage if his placement right before the scoring is good; yes, I know, you all get 10 action points to spend right before scoring which reduces this fact, but still).

 Finally, I didn’t like the rule about how you can trade a treasure chip with another player in order to complete a set, but the other player cannot trade the other way… Yes, I do realize why this rule is there, so you don’t swap back and forth, but I still think that yet a lucky draw of two similar treasures early in the game gives you an advantage, especially if somebody else draws the last treasure of that kind.

One of the most beautiful games around. I love the cover art. Also has a great theme. Unfortunately I find this to be quite slow in between turns due to the many possible ways to spend 10 action points. Good if played quickly but not something I'd want to play with overly analytical players.

I'm in a minority that dislikes the auction variant. I think it steals from the theme and needlessly extends the length of an already long game. This is a game which my wife and I really enjoy. Plays well with 2, 3 or 4 players. It's both beautiful and elegant in design. We play with one slight "catch up" modification in that, like with the auction rules, we play the final scoring round in order of lowest score to highest.. giving the occasional 20 AP in a row to a starting player that fell behind.

Thank you, Secret Santa 2008! You're the best ever...

I have played this game twice. Each time I have been very surprised by the outcome. (Truthfully, I am always surprised by the outcome of most games I play.) I love the theme and the "luck-of-the-draw" aspects of the game. But also a great deal of strategy and maneuvering are required. One day I will excavate a level 10 temple.

RATING: 9
Rated 8 after one play. I know this has a reputation for analysis-paralysis, but the first play with my fellow responsible, conscientious players went very smoothly and shorter than I expected. I really like this game and the flexibility that 10 action points provide.

On the one hand, it's a very abstract game. But I actualy enjoy the theme and feel that the theme really reinforces the mechanics. It's neat seeing the jungle unfold as your "dudes" spread out to explore all the temples. Maybe it's because the components are so good. This is a visually impressive game, especially for a game published prior to 2000. I certainly look forward to more plays.

Update: after my "nickel" play, I'm bumping this up to a 9. Every time I play this, I really enjoy it. I've yet to be disappointed by this game, and right now, I can't imagine this ever leaving my collection.

 Replay seems to be very high and the tactics are very open.  My only complaint is the down time between each players turn is difficult to deal with.  You really can't plan your next turn as the game dynamics change so quickly.  With only two players it was noticable, with three challenging, and with four it became boring waiting for your turn to come around.

I thought this was great really nicely balanced in terms of the amount of things you could do and what you needed to think about. Possibly a little bit of analysis paralysis as players try to calculate absolutely optimal moves in the scoring rounds. Looks fantastic.

RATING: 8.5
I like Tikal (not Tikal II).  I got it from the HK war game club with HK$215 during big sales period.  I like it very much.  I can classify this game between family and gamers game.  It is an old classic action point game.  Best with 2 and 3 people.  The game may have some downtime problem because each player should take 10 action points for each round.  10 Action points?!! ...you see 10 action points can generate so much downtime.  It's the only draw back of this game but I think the designer is brave to make this decision and rules on this game.  I can see the confident and elegant design of the designers.  This game is in small luck but high tactics. 
The components are good with wooden pieces.  The art design is cool.  The game can carry the theme well.  The action is smooth with a good player aid.  Easy to learn even for non-gamers (10 minutes can be used to explain the rules).  Normally I'll play this game without using the auction rules.  I like playing game with simple and elegant flow.

This game is suitable playing with non-gamers.  However, the leading person should be patient enough.  Avoid playing this game if you are analysis paralysis killer!!!

(1-23-11) After a couple of plays in quick succession after i bought it, the luster has worn off. Still enjoyable, and the the issue of deterrance and how to achieve it with minimal effort is particularly reewarding.

(original) First play was without auctions. It seemed a very tactical game of optimization, but with a deep strategic pulse. I'm very eager to play again.

Beautiful.  Lots of thought involved.  Never enough action points to do what you want to do.  End scoring is a little fiddly.

Update:  Up a point.  I wasn't sure about it being a two player game, but I've played a few now as a 2 player set up and it packs a lot of tension and thought.  Yeah, you've got a lot more options and the scoring is very high, but there's still a ton of interaction and conflict.

RATING: 6
Fun game with lots of interacting strategies.  I can see where the comments about analysis paralysis come from though, certainly during the scoring stage.  You need a crowd that can at least keep the pace moving.  The two player game is certainly fun, which is a big bonus.  Scales very well.

If you enjoy Catan then you will certainly enjoy this game! It's very similar, but has a different theme which I personally think is more exciting then Catan's. In Tikal, you're competing for control over temples and searching for treasure and excavating tiles in the Mayan jungles. I wish I owned this game so I could play it more! Two thumbs up from me!

2 face to face plays, 1 more online. I can see why it's so popular. Fun theme and decisions, yes there's the A/P issue but maybe not always, and jeepers! tremendous theme appeal. Is the basic game so bad? The bidding variant seems a downwardly-average solution to the turn order problem if it is a problem. The mini-maxing of points isn't always completely satisfying to me, but there's so much to like in this game.

Auction Rules. Another home run for Wolfgang Kramer, Tikal has everything I love in a board game, auctions, tight decisions, and pulls it all together with wonderful production values. The balance between treasure mongering and temple influence is spot on, and the differing ways to develop the board should give it excellent longevity. Hideous opportunism abounds in this game, and knowing when to bid high on the volcano tile, when to throw a few more barrels in the forest, when and how much to excavate a given site, and most importantly, when to sacrifice your grad students to the fiery god in trade for repeated guaranteed scoring of temples all are tricky decisions. These difficult options are the backbone of this game, as it is these nuances which will make or break your score by the final round.

There is some downtime which can be kept to a minimum by encouraging fast play.

Awesome!  I absolutely love the 10 action points each turn.  So many, yet never enough in the end.  The timing and location of tent placement is super crucial to ensure you can reach most of the temples.  Volcano tile placement is equally important.  Do you place it as a blocker or put it out of the way so you don't block yourself?  Great choices, strong theme, nice components.  Fun.

This game gets better and better the more I play it.  An intense brain burner, so after finishing the play a sense of complete exhaustion is a common feeling.

This game is an enduring classic, and will probably remain so.

Plays great with only 2 players. Has some luck in it, but you can take it away with the auction variant. We don't really mind the luck element in drawing the tiles, but it can be a little bit frustrating if one draws the same sort of tile over and over.

The theme is very nice implemented in the game mechanisms. I love it.

RATING: 8
Tikal is a beautiful game to look at and play with, and features an excellent subject supported by intruiging mechanisms based on action points, or AP for short. Wolfgang Kramer has made many games in which AP play a role, and this is his best. The players are explorers in the jungles of Central America and are searching for overgrown temples. The higher these temples, or the more excavated they are, the more points they are worth; and more points mean a higher chance at achieving victory. All available actions have a certain fixed 'cost' associated with them, and within a small handful of boundary rules the player is free to chose which actions he will take... Until his 'credit' for his turn runs out. A lovely mechanism as it rewards player creativity.

Tikal scales well with any number of players, but has a slightly annoying tendency to cause analysis paralysis in inexperienced players. Some people enjoy to calculate their way out of this game; I prefer to play by heuristics and a little intuition, using the action points only as a sort of bookkeeping aid. I don't believe it is necessary to become a human computer either: usually the board position is such that it is fairly obvious how your main plan should work out for this and the next few turns. The random tile element does not please some people, I find it adds a little schwung to the game which fits the exploration theme very, very well. I tried playing the game with the auction variant once, and me and my partners broke off halfway through. What is a nice and pleasing rythmical game becomes a grating and calculative mess. There [i]is[/i] more to this game than blatant min-maxing: it's also about not painting yourself into a corner, and that is not as easy as it looks.

Ugh, never again.  There's just so much that's so situational- am I going to be the one who has to spend the three AP on forcing a trade that's beneficial to both players because of the way the turn order falls on a scoring round?  Am I going to have 10 pieces at one end of the board that can't do shit because I get sniped?  Am I going to get really lucky and draw two of the sime treasure in a row?  Am I going to draw a blatantly worse tile than the previous person?  I can't control any of it, so why does this take ninety fucking minutes?

Fajna gra na rodzinne popołudnie lub spotkanie w gronie przyjaciół. Łatwo nauczyć z nią grać nowe osoby, więc będzie w sam raz dla początkujących graczy, nie jest skomplikowana, przygotowanie do gry również nie trwa zbyt długo. Początkowe ruchy są nieco nudne, ale to pomaga nowym graczom oswoić się, o co chodzi w tej grze. Tikal ćwiczy bardzo dobrze umiejętność planowania i zarządzania swoimi robotnikami, jest wyważona, wymaga odpowiednich kalkulacji, ale to właśnie najbardziej wciągało wszystkie osoby, z którymi grałam. Gra za każdym razem jest inna, stopniowo się rozkręca, szczególnie pod koniec niesamowicie emocjonująca. To klasyka gier planszowych w odświeżonym wydaniu. Klimat się tutaj nie wylewa, ale gra jest bardzo ładnie wykonana, dla fanów sucharków jak znalazł.

First partial two-player game was excellent.  Love the dynamic of how the scoring round takes place for each player after they complete their ten-point turn, so that the situation on the board is constantly changing.  Three-player game was quite different from the two-player game.  Somehow I got frozen out of much of the final scoring round.  Still, a very cool game that I am looking forward to playing again.

The rating for this game should scale based on the AP of who you are playing with.  We played this recently with all fast-but-good players and it was fantastic and very different in feel from the more modern Euros because of how many action points were available on each move, but with slow players this game WAY overstays its welcome.  Even Dave thought this was fun on the last play and he normally hates games where I can steal something he has spent the whole game building.

RATING: 8
Fun atmosphere, intriguing gameplay. We play with the auction rules; random tiles seems overly chaotic for a game like this. While the potential for analysis paralysis seemed high at first, it hasn't been a major problem in our playgroup since the very first play.

Note: Tikal is not terribly forgiving of larger-scale mistakes; limited mobility means refocusing elsewhere takes more time than you may have. Additionally, if you're not competing with a particular player, you have no way to try and slow them down if they draw ahead. I don't view either of these as flaws, simply useful truths about the game.

Bought this new for $34.95 US at Hobbytown USA in Wisconsin.  (Boy, that was a great game store!  I bought a lot of good games at that one stop.)
This is one of my very favourite games.  I do well at it.  2-4 players.  I love the tile discovery aspect, so every game is different.  Sometimes we play with the auction variant, but I slightly prefer just taking turns in order, making the best of what you flip over.  It's an area control game.
This was the first game I bought designed by Kiesling and Kramer.  I later bought Tikal II (not as good), and Torres (very good, but I have only played it a few times.)
Fantastic game components.  Even a fantastic box insert!  It is one of the few Rio Grande Games that I own.
It is one of three games by the same designers in the Mask Trilogy.  I have not played the others (Java, in 2000, and Mexica, in 2002), but I keep my eyes open for them in game stores.  I understand that they all use the same action point system.  Torres is considered the unofficial fourth game in that trilogy, and I agree.
I love this game!

I bought a second copy for $14 from Connol Radke's garage sale.  The rule book is just photocopied though.

20061207: One game played so far (on SpielByWeb), completely ruined by treasure tile draws: when you can only get three treasures all game, you've got no chance of winning, as far as I can see. That's even worse than rolling badly in Settlers. Hopefully, skill can mitigate this, but I don't know if I want to play again to find out. Way too much AP in this game: perhaps five action points per turn (instead of ten) would help. Rating: 4.5.

Overall, an outstanding game from Kramer and Kiesling where action points combine wonderfully with area control and tile placement. Easy to teach, perfect middle-weight game, prone to a bit of AP for some players, with enough elements of luck in the tile-draw version to keep the game fun and exciting, and everyone on their toes. The auction version ups the AP a bit, but also takes away some of the luck for a more strategic game. A delightfully fun game to play with a nice pace and rhythm that rewards player creativity and is just amazing in terms of simple yet deep elegance. One of my favourites.

I suck at this, but it is Kramer, area majority, and stunning to look at with a theme that truly matches the mechanics. What's not to love here?  Of the 10 options, only a few are viable on any one turn and your strategy will shape subsequent turn options, so AP should NOT be an issue here.

A majority game where you have the option of increasing the value of the targets (in this case, temples).

Bought this early on when discovering eurogames. Like the theme of the game - feels like you're discovering different parts of the jungle and uncovering ruins.

Tikal is SO incredible. I love its presentation and its mechanics. Although players have access to many actions, there are only two ways to score.

Each tile placed dramatically impacts the board state - magnificent.

RATING: 7
One of the prettiest games out there. The board is a gorgeous shade of green, and as the game is played it becomes sprinkled with three dimensional pyramids and volcano tiles that make it even nicer. The stones mechanism for movement not only works well, it seems to create the feel of moving up and down stairs in the jungle and gives the board even more dimension. The game play is good as well, but in the basic game the random draw of tiles can win or lose the game--if the same person always draws the volcanoes he is unlikely to win. There is an advanced way to play that involves auctioning the tiles, but I have never played that way, as I understand it also lengthens the game considerably.

Update: A recent play revealed a big flaw to me: there is no catch up mechanism in the game. If someone jumps out to a lead there is really no way to catch him.

I enjoy this game no matter the number of players.  About as highly rated a game as I could find among my family, although sometimes all that thinking can give us all a headache.  Action point games are great when they are done well, because of all of the choices and the feeling that there is always a different way you could approach what you want to accomplish.  Usually once a game, each player will have one of those REALLY long turns where time stands still.  An excellent game, though.

A nice exploration and action point system game.

The theme and components are very pleasant and the gameplay is interesting. It's all about figuring out how to maneuver your explorers and where to set up your camps.

The varied costs of the different actions makes it a real challenge to discover the best move(s). Essentially, there are many valuable moves, but only a few best ones. If you enjoy the feeling of heavy puzzle-solving, this may be a good one for you.

- Gameplay and replayability: 3/3. Superb positional strategy and high replayability, reminding me vaguely of Chess.

- Luck factor: 3/3. There is some luck involved in drawing random tiles, but it is very small can be compensated for. And if that still bothers you, there is a (slightly less elegant) rule variant that rules out the luck factor completely.

- Player range: 3/3. Tikal is very good with any number of players, also with 2.

- Duration: 2/3. The game takes approximately 1.5 hour, independent from the number of players. Analysis paralysis must be countered by coughs and humming, otherwise it will ruin the game.

- Learning curve: 2/3. Tikal can be explained in some 10 minutes, which is great in my opinion. It takes some experience to be able to win however, which is also a good thing.

- Theme and looks: 2/3. Magnificent game board and a plausible although a bit shallow theme.

- Set up/clean up time: 3/3. Setting up the game takes some 5 minutes, cleanup is even faster.

- Documentation: 3/3. Clear and unambiguous rule book and good quick reference documentation.

- Summary: This is the best board game I've played so far.

One of the great classic Euros that's still fun after many years and innumerable newer games.  Very competitive, with hexes and a good amount of messing with your opponents, so it has some appeal to wargamers.  Variable board means it never plays exactly the same way twice.

Does not produce nearly the brain lock that you might think for a game that allots you 10 action points per turn. The players early in the turn order have an advantage but not an overwhelming one. The cure (playing the auction variant, which overly prolongs the game) is worse than the disease.

Incontournable ! Il est impensable de ne pas posséder un exemplaire de Tikal dans sa ludothèque.
Le thème est fort, très fort. L'immersion est totale dans une ambiance de trésors perdus et de temples enfouis dans une forêt tropicale. Les mystères de l'exploration sont parfaitement bien rendus grâce à un principe de tuiles hexagonales que l'on pioche au hasard à son tour et que l'on pose en laissant apparaître un nouvel endroit de la forêt.
Le matériel est absolument somptueux, les règles simples et très claires s'apprennent en 15 minutes. A chaque partie, le terrain sera différent puisqu'il est construit au fur et à mesure de la partie. Les rebondissements de situation, les courses aux trésors et la lutte pour le contrôle des temples rendent les parties tendues du début à la fin.

I have a special fondness for this game, since it was the first "Euro" board game I bought back in 2005 when I first became aware that such games existed outside the mainstream of roll-and-moves like Monopoly, Risk, and Pictionary etc. It has a well-considered integration of theme and mechanics, and involves the signature Kramer scoring method of outnumbering opponents.

Very intense.  The first game I ever played that involved a point system - having a limited number of points to spend each turn.  It's the only game I can say that has kept me awake at night thinking about the move I should have made and didn't!  Every game is different too.  It does involve a big commitment of time, but the time flies for me.

A good and lovely looking game of exploration. The game is a blend of strategical and tactical decisions and one of the finer examples of the famous action point system that even somehow fits thematically (think of traversing difficult paths). The only complaint is, that after a while, one gets the feeling that all games turn out to be pretty similar to one another.

A sleeper hit! Yeah I heard of the game, but it didn't spark my interest. Someone at my meetup brought it out so I played it and fell in love with it. Nice tile placement exploration/adventure game. Maybe low on adventure, but a nice thematic game nonetheless.

I prefer Mini-Tikal, a 2 player variant. Currently my favorite 2 player game.

Love the theme and production. I play it mostly online and the auction version doesn't seem to work, which is a bummer.  Playing without that against people who know how to play means alot of the final outcome depends on who scores first, which is the fatal flaw of the non-auction version of the game.

RATING: 7
This is an solid game which I quite enjoy.  It's one of those games where you are given so many "action points" per turn and you have a lot of choices how to use them.  As such, it is light on player interaction, and heavy on max/min'ing.  This means that sometimes it can run a bit long for a euro...especially w/players that take forever trying to find the optimal usage of the action points.  Admittedly, I had to force myself to make (most likely) sub-optimal moves a couple of times because I didn't want to draw out my turn.  Our games have run a bit over 2 hours.

RATING: 6
Beautiful looking game, themed on the excavation of an ancient South American city. The board is emerald green jungle to begin with, but gradually opens up as large hex tiles fill in the board. Tiles contain temples (which can be excavated further to increase their value), treasure locations (which can be looted for points), empty areas or volcanoes (time for a scoring round). Players spend 10 action points each turn to bring their diggers onto the board and attempt to win influence over the temples and treasures. Points are scored for treasure sets and majorities in temple areas. A serious 90 minute game that spawned several other &quot;spend action point&quot; games.

I play this just infrequently enough to forget everything I learned from the previous playing.  Like, that you can't win with just treasures.  And that the swoop-in-and-guard tactic is very frustrating.  And that I'm just not a big fan of action-points/majority-control games.  I think I slightly prefer this without the auction variant; the added decisions just make my head hurt more, so that I don't mind the potential luck of the tile draw or seating order.

What this game is lacking is a sense of fun and narrative. 

But as for balance and strategy, this game is a great little euro. It has amazing components and looks gorgeous. The set-collecting path is a good way to give another avenue for scoring to those who have been shut out from temples. The tile placing is subtle and lets each player steer the board development, but hard to truly hurt your opponents too much.

This game is a lot of fun.  You're exploring the Central American jungle and excavating ruins.  The build development as you clear jungle fits the theme well is quite lovely.

Solid action-point exploration game which can be quite analytical and intense despite a very simple and straight-forward rule set.   I think the production on this is okay but it would be better with cooler pyramid structures to build.  I think that would boost this game's appeal.   I wouldn't want to play with an AP-prone group, because this game could easily go into a lockdown, especially towards the end.   We played with the auctions, which I liked, but it works absolutely fine as a family game without the auctions too.

I really like the theme of this game.  When I play it though, when some people tend to get a bit behind in the points, they feel they cant come back, when they really have a good chance of winning.  I'm not sure why this happens with this game. There is some screwage factor in this game which can cause some unhappy treasure hunters.

The best example of an AP (Analysis Paralysis)game. Which means that turns by your opponent can be slow.  It takes place in the jungle, temples, and all the Indiana Jones stuff. Great map, very good counters. Look for the some of the players aids in the file section.

I really like the game, the decisions, and the thought process to make choices.

Uncertainty seemed to diminish too much between the last volcano and the end of the game. Solving the tactical puzzle of maximizing your score can be pleasurable, but it distracted me from more strategic thinking. We played three player, which caused unequal contention: I was in the middle and the players on either side of me didn't interact much. If I play again I'd try to think more strategically in the early game. Also, it seemed a little long.

We really like Tikal. It burns your brain, though in a simple way. There aren't really that many options on your turn, especially the last third of the game.

The game rules of Tikal are easy to learn. Mastering your action points each turn takes many plays. What you do with your ten pts is more complex than it looks. You have to judge what is more important each turn. Do you go for short term or long term? Lots of different possibilities in Tikal.

I need to play Tikal more to give a more detail opinion of the game.

Mesopotamia is similiar to Tikal.

I want to try it with the auction variant. Without the auctions, I don't like it much. Interesting, but too much randomness - a 3 or 4.

I think this game is a little underrated.    The variety of actions possible in a single turn allow for unpredictable things, though there are only a few basic strategic paths to win.  There seems to be a lot of confusion regarding guarding temples... but it seems clear to me in the rules.

Tikal is a really enjoyable area majority game which plays well with 2, using the auction variant.

RATING: 7.5
When the BBG was first created it was I who put "Action Point Allowance System" into the database, much to Derk's chagrin.  Tikal was probably the preminent game I had in mind when I put this awkwardly worded game mechanism category in there.

I love this kind of game mechanic, it makes any game, regardless of theme, feel like a wargame to me.  The point system gives some feel of production of units for your armies, while at the same time giving a feel for "command and control" aspects of waging war.  As a high ranking commander there are only so many things you can focus on in the grand scheme of things and the point system allows enough flexibility to decide how much you want to focus on one particular aspect of the conflict.

Of course all of this language has nothing to do with Tikal in terms of its theme, it's about uncovering ruins in the jungle, but all of those elements are very much present if you look past the direct theme.

I really like Tikal.  It has this mechanic that I really enjoy using in a game, the game itself is gorgeous and wonderfully symbolic in explaining the rules on the components.  The action points wed very well to the theme so things don't feel all that pasted on for a euro game, it's all good stuff.

The problem has more to do with time and other players for myself.  The game is on the longer side and can suffer from analysis paralysis if players are wont to do that type of thing.  You also really ought to have everyone playing at a similar level with one another for more challenging play.  

Because of those issues this is more of a classic that should be revisted now and again rather than something that gets picked up all the time.  I don't think I'd ever discard with my copy, but I don't see myself clamoring to pull it out at every game session.

This is an interesting area control, tile laying and action point game. If you're playing this game, I would highly recommend using the auction variant if you want to reduce the randomness. The trade off is that, when playing the auction variant, expect your game to last longer.  I enjoy the tile laying which in a way relates to route building because when you lay tiles you're determining how people access various tiles and how many action points it will cost to get to that tile. There are also some actions that are limited in the game such as laying tents (which helps with movement) and guarding temples (which means only you will gain VP for that temple). Overall this is a good game, but it can easily lead to analysis paralysis and tends to make the game the game overstay it's welcome.  Even without AP, I find the game to be too long for the enjoyment I get out of it.

Wow, very thematic, lots of tough choices and decisions for players to make.  Has real player interaction and new game surprises based on the random map variability.  Very easy set-up, easy well-written rules and great components.  Kudos to the designer for making the mechanics into a fun game!  If anything, the amount of turn options can be a bit overwhelming for new players and lead to AP, especially the turn strategies.  This game can run a little long for larger games, and I I feel the pre-game bidding is more suited only to expert players.  However I am very impressed with the 2 player variant rules. I really need to get this one to the table more frequently.

Another of the Tikal, Mexica, Java group.  Tikal is another excellent game that has you unearthing ancient temples in a jungle.  The tile laying makes each game unique and there is just something about that back and forth of trying to capture the tallest temples. Truly great game.

I love the theme of this game, I love the exploration and area control elements, and we also really like the auction even though we do not like auctions or bidding in games. Increasingly though, I feel that Seeland has replaced this game for me. While I have a good time when I play, something just seems a bit lacking for me. It has now sat on the shelf unplayed for almost a year.

I keep coming across comments about how brilliant this game is, and how agonising it is not to be able to have enough action points to do everything...In our games it's not uncommon to hear "I'll do this, this and then this, and then....hmmmm....I'm good." (with 7 action points left!) We tried the mini Tikal variant but we found it too short and quite unsatisfying so I don't know how to 'fix' this game for us.

1 play: a pretty enjoyable first play, will definitely play again.

Initial plays - 8

RATING: 6
I'm generally not a fan of area majority, but I like this one. The 10 action points enable you to accomplish a good deal each turn, and the tension is kept by the threat of each other locking down temples or putting out a new base camp. The treasures add another way to go if you get (overly) blocked on temples. Have to play with exactly 4P to keep the battles balanced.

Best box insert ever (even better than Days of Wonder games).  Tile laying + action selection + area control + expanding board!!!  There is a lot going on in this game, which is why I love it.  Have not played the auction version of the game because most of my plays have been 2-player with my wife.  Only minor critique is that since this game is an action selection game with 10 actions to distribute per turn, players can very easily be prone to Analysis Paralysis.

Rating based on one play. I can see that this game isn't poorly designed; nothing looks broken and things actually make sense. However... it's just so slow and boring. So. Much. Also, it seems that getting an early lead is the easiest way to victory, and that a player who gets boxed-in by others will struggle to get back in the game, but I may be wrong.

RATING: 8
Tikal is a beautiful but deceptively tactical game that incorporates tile placement, anticipation and planning for the scoring rounds, optimal placement of your explorers, capitalizing on other player's excavations, and of course the careful allocation of those action points.  The auction variant makes this all that much better.  Analysis paralysis can be a problem, though I think this very much depends on your group.  For us, Tikal is a great family game.

Nice little explore and build game with an action point allowance.

The action point allowance allows for a multitude of actions per turn therefore you may choose several different strategies, do you explore deep into the jungle hoping to find treasures and big level temples or do you stick close to the jungle clearing where you begin and work tirelessly to uncover a nearby temple scoring maximum points for it?

Cool game.  I love the theme, the mechanics, everything.  I don't think the AP is unreasonable.  Normal rules make it a bit lighter, gamer's will probably prefer to auction the tiles.  The stack of tiles basically serve as a time barometer for the game, so you can always tell how much longer the game will last, a nice feature.  Update: the problem is (as with many people), I just don't pull it out to play very often, so the rating has gone down a full point.

I have only played once with the auction variant, and that was on SpielByWeb.  It was okay: you're mainly bidding for turn order, and 90 percent of the time, passing seems to be the best choice.

Great looking game but feels like a math puzzle.  I like to play games from the gut and do my evaluations in a spatial way instead of making math based decisions.  I don't think the action point mechanic is for me since it makes me figure out each move in my head several way to make sure I'm doing the optimal move.  All the decisions and over think do not add up to more fun.    I enjoy it if I can keep it on a light family level.  On scoring rounds I reach for a calculator...  Only Kramer would make you tally lots of small numbers into scores in the 80's.  I don't want to work that hard for a Eurogame.  I'm not worried about the AP factor but the counting is tedious.  Having said that, I'm close to rating this game an 8 because I really do like it and the production is fantastic.

RATING: 6
[Action points, Tile-laying, Area majority, Exploration, Auction] [4P:5, 3P:6, 2P:6] Beautiful board, nice bits, cool theme. One of the "Action Point" games from Kramer and Kiesling, Tikal is interesting and thought-provoking. However, I can see how some groups get paralyzed by analysis in the game, especially in the late stages. Well, ok, deciding what tiles to bid on can also take some time. A "menu" of options is rarely a good thing for speedy play, and when the other players are idle, then it leads to downtime. Good game, but only for groups who can make decisions without crunching too many numbers. *** UPDATE: The Auction variant is definitely the only good way to play this game, as the random tile draws influence the game too much, but it draws the game out too much. The one-auction-per-tile thing is painful. Is there a way to do one auction for all four tiles? I suppose, but that's not in the rules. Knocked down from 7 to 6. It's not as good as Java or Mexica - its siblings have advantages over it (Java is better overall, at the same speed; Mexica is faster and cleaner). ***UPDATE: Unless invited to play by someone else, while I'll probably do, there's never any reason to pick Tikal over Torres, Java or Mexica. It's just not as good, and not as fun, as the other three games. As an additional penalty, it takes twice the time to play compared to Torres and Mexica, about as long as Java, which is a big minus as it doesn't have the depth to warrant that kind of time investment. Finally knocked down to its final score of 5. ***UPDATE: Ok, back up to 6. I'll play if asked, as long as everyone can play at a speedy pace. Tikal is decent, though it's still my least-favored game of the Mask Trilogy.

Great majority and placement game. You really feel like clearing the jungle, you see the pyramids rising up, you collect treasures ...

The tension is there throughout the game: the revelation of the four tiles volcano (count points) is a sword of Damocles and makes it necessary to optimize your travel and hold well the game to score effectively.

However, subject to analysis paralysis that can dramatically slow the flow of the game.

The game board and materials are wonderful, so that one wants to return soon.

EDIT : I prefer it to his brother Tikal II that is "too much of all" (teleportation, rondel...) and more abstract. I won't buy Tikal II, Tikal is definitely purer.

I'm a big fan of this game.  I think that for most of the game, downtime is not too much of an issue, contrary to public opinion, at least when playing with average players. There are a lot of choices, but if you make a few longer term plans and you’re not blocked at every turn, it doesn’t have to take long to simply follow through with them. The last scoring round can drag if it’s a close game.

Pros: 
- It's a very pretty game. The artwork is very detailed (down to tire treads imprinted on the dirt beside the base camp) and lush.
- The idea of exploring a jungle is usually pretty appealing. People that like Carcassonne have a good chance of wanting to try this.
- The rules are relatively simple. In fact, for a game with this amount of strategic depth, I think it has some of the simplest rules out there.
- It doesn't take any longer to play with 4 people than 3.

Cons:
- It can easily take a couple of hours to play.
- With people that have to make just the right move every turn, downtime can be an issue.
- A newbie doesn't have much chance of beating experienced players (I see this as a pro, but many newbies won't).

Tikal needed a bit of time and a few plays to grow on me, but I like it very much now. It's a very direct and to-the-point game with a fairly mean streak and quite a bit ahead of its time. Area majorities where several players can claim the same majority still seem like a stroke of genius to me.

10 action points for turn make for a lot of options, but I haven't experienced the AP issues so many people seem to be concerned about. Besides, it's beautiful. I haven't actually played the auction variant yet (except in the two-player mini variant), but I don't think it is necessary either.

PRO - Board reveal mechanic is cool.  Player aids are excellent.

CON - Easy to lose track of your action points and where you spent them as you are taking actions.  Think I will add 10 poker chips to the box to help with accounting.

RATING: 6.2
a good game and very pretty, but feels like it outlasts its welcome and takes a bit too long to conclude. Tried the tiny tikal variant, which helps, but this is a bit tricky due to cards and letters and such not lining up easily, and so setup is easy to do wrong if you try and shorten game.  because of these issues, it wasnt hitting the table, so i traded it in a math trade (received Macao). i DO like the Action Point mechanic...

Fun area control game. Upgrading (uncovering) temples is fun, as is finding/stealing treasures. However, often by the end of the game we've used up almost every temple tile and we've been coasting on easy decisions for a while. We haven't tried the auction variant yet, but I don't see how it could alleviate our problem.

RATING: 7
Tikal is a great game though somehow it doesn't make it to the table very often. I find the exploring-part of the game very nice, but I really like the way you score your points.

During the game you try to place your workers tactically, keeping your options open and keeping an eye on your opponent. Once the scoring-round has started you need to the optimize the points you can score with these workers and try to bug your opponent as well.

A modern classic to me.
I love the feeling of discovery meanwhile we are populating the board with tiles. I feel like an explorer in the jungle of Guatemala.

Great great game from the dynamic duo Kramer - Kiesling.

I guess this game is not for me. I know there is a lot of possibilities and decisions but I don't find them particularly interesting. I don't have much fun playing this. The source of my indifference for this game may be the lack of progression I perceive. It's a long game (at least, it feels very long) with no culmination. For me, it becomes dull very rapidly.

RATING: 10
Probably my favourite game. I had Tikal since about 2000 and I have enjoyed playing it ever since. That says something about replayability :) Anyway, it is an easy game to get into as the rules are very simple, the board is beautiful and the theme is as cool as it gets in my opinion. However, it is a very deep game, where the challenge comes mainly from the trickiness of your opponents and not the game's AI. And I have the luck to know some very tricky people :D Or I am easy to trick. Doesn't matter, I love to play this game and would recommend it to anyone who likes brain burners.

Played for the first time at WBC 2009.  I was taught the game at a demo session and played in the heat right after.  Even with only the most basic instructions I was able to pick it up quickly.  I like the exploration theme and how the board grows out as you play.  I could see how the action point system could bog down if you over analyze every option.  I found it was just best to go with your intuition and see what happens.  I have only played with the auction variant.  I would like to try the basic game as well.

Nice game, good theme for a Euro.  Seems to be decent player screwage and some tough choices and especially direct competition on the same board (a lost art in Euros these days.)

I do enjoy Kiesling & Kramer's Action Point system. Tikal is the second of his 'Action Point' games - with Torres being the first. Torres is quite different with its 3Dness, but Tikal is quick, easy-to-play fun with the right amount of depth and beauty. I think the theme is excellent and Tikal is a classic example of Kiesling & Kramer's AP mechanic.  The simplest of their 'Mask' games to play, but also the most thematically rigorousness one as well.  The others can play quite abstractly at time (regardless of theme).  Though Tikal is simpler, it hits all the right mechanics-to-theme buttons.

Fun family game that has many interesting choices and doesn't induce AP as I first feared. It's thematic, competitive without being too stressful, and the board and playing pieces are very nice.

RATING: 7
I prefer other Kramer titles (El Grande, The Princes of Florence, Heimlich & Co.) but Tikal offers an interesting gaming experience unique to the others.  The most appealing thing for me is the aesthetics of the game.  I love how the more tiles are played the more stripped back the board appears. This gives a great boost to the thematics of exploration; although Tikal is primarily an area control game.  As aforementioned Tikal is not my first choice for a game by Kramer, but I would never turn down a play.  I am interested in playing the other games in the mask trilogy.

First real "gamer's game" that I owned and introduced my wife to.  She loved the exploration feel to the game and slowly started playing more offensively as she caught on.  This is the game that started my collection after seeing a review in an issue of Games magazine.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Great artwork and quality construction. Nice theme. The timing of scoring rounds is randomized, so one must be careful to maintain good board coverage throughout most of the game so as to avoid missing an opportunity to score.

Tikal does not rate higher for me because I think it plays too long for what it is.  Furthermore, the action point system can be problematic for anyone who is prone to analysis paralysis--the downtime between turns can easily become excessive, especially in a 4p game.  (I have played a 2p game of Tigris and Euphrates with the player on my right during the Tikal downtime.  This greatly improved the experience!)

I have come to see Tikal differently over time.  Recently, I have tired of the standard rules and the inherent randomness of the tile draw.  Also, in standard mode only 2 and 4 player games have any real balance.  In 3 player games it has been my experience that the players that "mix it up" the most will tend to hand the victory to the 3rd player. My rating for the standard rules is therefore "5" but must be averaged with the "7" I give the auction variant of Tikal.

My good game buddy Ed found one of the last Ravensburger editions on line because I was so needing Tikal at the time.

RATING: 8
Super Meeple production is top notch!  Love the resin temples like in Mexica.

Tile placement, excavating, movement, guarding, treasure swap.. all are quality decisions and scale nicely at 2.

Mini Tikal not necessary as we played the full game quite quickly, less than 90 mins.  Didn't seem to have longer turns at the end, in fact the opposite.

Has an open feel but immediately after your first move you set your team in motion and start committing. 

Random scoring times also keeps the tension high but since you get a turn beforehand, keeps the aggravation and luck low.



Negatives:
The archealogist meeples are too small for my tastes.  Probably to allow for contested spaces in a 4 player game?  A slightly larger stackable version would have been preferred.

Rulebook should be multilingual since English and German speakers will also want this nicer version.

Pros : A beautiful game with a theme (I love that green board and the 3D temples, the volcanos and those tiny tents). Interesting although "classical" gameplay by K & K (actions points to spend).

Really like the balance of luck and skill; we'll see how it holds up after repeated playings.  Playing Tikal mainly on Spielbyweb and enjoying it quite a bit.  I just wish the scoring mechanism was a bit different.  I suppose this was the best possible alternative and thoroughly explored by the designers, but for me it detracts a bit from what is mostly a very fun game.  Revising this to a 10 based on play at Speilbyweb.  Once they get the auction version implemented it will be even better.  This game has great replayability.  I've played many games on SPW and have not tired of it.  I have only played a couple of games FtF and do not enjoy it as much that way.  On SBW the AP isn't a downside.

Update:  I've moved my rating down to a 9.  I still enjoy Tikal quite a bit, but have lost just a bit of my enthusiasm.  I have yet to play with the bidding variant and that might move it back up to a 10.

Gave my copy away as a gift...may re-acquire at some time.

This is a fun little game. It seems a bit complicated when you're trying to hash it out at the beginning, but once you start playing, it's actually a pretty simple game that rewards forward-thinking, aggressive players. Folks with good math-crunching brains ought to do well at this, because most of it involves figuring out how you can wring the most points out of a possible scoring turn. You are rewarded by playing each round as if the volcano were about to appear and making sure that your pieces on the board have good potential to earn you some points when your turn comes 'round. It's an easy game to get into and also quite easy to enjoy. I wanted the game to last a little longer, though, but part of playing Tikal is wanting that one more turn to get another level on that temple before you guard it. Good, clean family fun.

Played on iPad. Little bit slow, but quite tactical area control, area movement and action point allowance system game. Seems that I have to try it more to understand better how to get most of it. However, it takes more time than expected and that is biggest drawback. Some luck elements, decent theme, overall quite interesting game.

Matt received for Christmas 12/24/08.

My first play was with 4 people (including myself). Three of us (including myself again) were first-time players. That stretched the game to 3 hours, but I didn't mind at all. I can see I made mistakes by not thinking ahead to what others might do. I finished in 4th but knew I would definitely like to play again.

During that game, 2 of us (not me) played a game of T&E on the side in between high-AP turns others were taking. That other game finished before Tikal did.

Unfortunately I don't think this one scales very well. The map size needs to be changed (I do this using the variants in the forums here) to make the sites competitive with different numbers. Also prone to AP, though I don't find this to be as extreme as others seem to suggest. Great game however. I love the random development of the board, a unique aspect that distinguishes Tikal from Louis and El Grande, two other pinnacles of the Area Majority genre.

I really enjoy this game and it's much more strategic than I thought when first reading the rules. How you can traverse by how you place the stones on the tiles is critical and can really pin certain players into spots on the board they don't want to be in. The game is a bit fiddly with all the temple tiles, but that would be corrected if I were to get the Super Meeple edition, which I just might do given how much I enjoyed my play. It's a pretty looking game on the table, even if you just play the base Rio Grande edition.

Tikal is a really fun and strategic game.  It really takes more than one play before you realize the full potential of the game, so if the first time through wasn't too much fun, give it another go.  There is an extraordinary depth of strategy that is possible in Tikal, but it's masked well enough in the jungle adventure theme that nongamers can enjoy it as well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
If you're playing Tikal, you're playing Kramer game. And if you playing Kramer game, you don't have enough time or resources or whatever to do what you want to do and you have to make choices, hard choices sometimes. The anxiety attacks set in. I don't like these kind of games, when you can't do everything you want to do, yet you must do something. That's why I love these kind of games.  :)  

So I'm going to call these games a "Kramer", because just like in life you can't have your cake and eat it too. And that's why these games are so good. 

This one to boot has amazingly appealing graphics that makes you feel like you're actually exploring the jungle by opening it up parcel by parcel. Very well done. Love it. And you will too.

Explore the ancient Mayan city of Tikal by unearthing ancient temples, collecting treasures, and most importantly, claiming your discoveries.

Tikal is quickly becoming a favorite. Tactically, you want your opponents to build up the most valuable temples as opportunities for you to control during the four scoring rounds. This game is Machiavellian in nature, but not subversive for players. After a couple plays, everyone is aware of the potential of scoring rounds and how to capitalize on those occasions. Easy enough to learn and feel satisfied on your first game.

A good integration of theme with mechanics. Exploring jungles, digging for treasure, excavating temples and guarding them from other explorers.  It's simply brilliant how it is all integrated together so beautifully into a game that is fun and challenging.

There is a definite chance for analysis paralysis and downtime with this game when played in person as opposed to online, and for that I'm dropping it from 10 to 8.5, but played among a group familiar with the game, where everyone can move intuitively, it moves along fine.

Jó kis játék sok tervezési lehetöséggel, megfelelö arányú gonoszkodási, keresztbetevési aránnyal, nagyon szép kivitelben. Van lehetöség megfelelö mértékben az ellenfelek egymás ellen kijátszására is. Ezekbö fakadóan tán nem ideális három fö részére, de négy fönek nagyon jó, s ketten is élvezhetö (itt problémás lehet a kincsek szerzésében rejlö szerencse).

4-fös játék:
A vulkán lapokat nem egyforma valószínüséggel húzzák fel a játékosok, erre legkisebb az esélye az elsö játékosnak, az ellenpóluson pedig a negyedik játékos áll. Ezzel együtt jár persze az is, hogy jellemzöen az összes vulkán elökerülésének pillanatában fennáll az, hogy az elsö játékos 10 akcióponttal többet használt fel, mint a negyedik játékos.

A very good strategy-game with a fair amount of luck, but with an optional bidding rule to reduce the luck-factor to a minimum.

While this is a great game, it can suffer due to downtime, as there are many options and things to consider and you can´t plan ahead on an other players turn. I never found this to be a huge problem, but downtime can be a factor for some ppl.

This is one of those games in my collection that I find entertaining 90% of the time. Every once in a while there's a game that's not very entertaining because of the tiles you draw (i.e. you draw nothing but empty hexes). On the whole however, it's pretty balanced and entertaining to play. Also, it has, hands down, the best designed box in terms of holding the components.

Tikal is a game which I respect but don't really enjoy. The analysis woes you hear about everywhere are somewhat well-founded, as the possibilities are so many and varied each turn. You really can spend lots of time going through the possible iterations in your head, just to get that ideal, perfectly efficient turn. The result is that the game can really drag. However, it has to be said that this is a deep and subtle game, and that the analysis is well rewarded if you're into that kind of thing and have like-minded opponents. Action point games are not for me, but this is certainly one of the best of its kind, and I can see why it's regarded as a classic.

Every time I play this, I remain a bit surprised that the theme and "fun factor" is so highly palpable for me, especially given the relatively abstract action point system and area control goals. The development of the board really provides the feel of hacking your way through a jungle to explore and profit from forgotten ruins. Despite the occasional long playing times, I enjoy every minute of it. Just keeps getting better... I haven't yet played the auction variant. Note: With only 2 players, there is not enough continued competition for temples in the late game - strongly suggest using the 2-player Mini-Tikal variant posted in the BGG Variants section.

Me gusta muchísimo y la idea me parece distinta a la mayoría de los juegos que he probado. Sin embargo, si los jugadores son buenos, las partidas de cuatro se hacen insoportables pues el tiempo de espera entre turno y turno es muy elevado. Con tres personas la cosa mejora y con dos, a apesar de ser mucho más rápido, pierde un poco de intensidad.

Como solución probamos a limitar el tiempo máximo de un jugador y os aseguro que funciona de maravilla.

One of the best area influence game that i have ever played. The action point system works well i love it. However because you are not really involved in the other players turns this can cause big downtime. It is more likely to happen in the end of the game when analysis paralises becomes a true factor. On the other hand this game is easy on rules and super easy to teach. I mean with other words it is elegant. Of course it is long around 2 hours, but it grants very low luck factor and played like chess. For example a situation you might encounter in the game: If i put this here she will go there, so i will put there instead. Hopefully the game grants very high level of player interaction, where you are constantly try to kick out somebody from the temples by fighting for them. It is not rare that one of your enemy built up a great value temple and you are just sneaking some dudes into it and steal his work :). If someone playing this in a clever way it is hard to stop stomeone building up a bunker. I believe with the right backround music this is a very thematic exploration game.

Pros / Cons:
-Every game is different, which means huge replayability.
-High intreaction area influence with some element of screw your neighbour.
-With the bidding rules it has low to no luck factor.
-Also really thematic exploration game.

-The gameplay is 2 hours, with huge downtime near the end.

Very good game, looks good, plays well and there's lot to do (use your action points). However, in that plethora of things you can do lies the biggest problem of the game. Sometimes, especially if played with people who doesn't have much experience of Tikal, turns might take a really long time and term "analysys paralysys" is a serious thing that can happen to any player. You simply freeze over when you start thinking what you should do, how and when. But game itself, mechanically, is really good. And I do love this theme, even though there's nothing too special about it.

In this game you explore the jungle for temples and treasures using an action point system.  This game is infamous for the AP (Analysis Paralysis) that is common on people's turns since you have 10 action points in which you can do numerous different things.

I like this game a lot.  It is easy enough to see how to get points yet deep enough to make you think a lot about how you want to go about getting them.  There are a lot of good decisions to make each turn while simultaneously pondering where your opponents may go.  It has that abstract level of conflict that I think adds to the game and really shines.  The way scoring works is nice as everyone gets an opportunity to get a go for maximum points.  The artwork is great and I really like the modular board.

The only downsides are that it is quite AP-prone, making me fear that the better you get at the game, the longer it would take as you see more and more options to analyze with greater knowledge and strategy.  Also, the groupthink kingmaking can turn into 'he's getting x this turn, she needs y, I will take points from him instead'.  It's a blessing and a curse - good to easily see who will be ahead but also curse because people can really try to screw up your area if they want.

Great series of games, but somehow I rarely win this one.  Need to pull it out again and see if I can figure it out better.

3/4/12- Played all 3 mask games this weekend, so I got a better feel for how they compare.  Tikal still feels more luck-based (basic game, not bidding game) and suffers a little by comparison, but I think it defeinitely deserves better than a 6 (?!), so I am raising it to 6.75.

RATING: 7
I bought this game solely on the awards it has won, and after playing it, I understand. It is a "classic" Euro type game. It's prone to analysis-paralysis with all those action points, but it is a fun game with a rich, deep theme. I really feel like I am exploring the jungles of South America, uncovering treasures and excavating pyramids. The basic game seems a touch unbalanced, due to a deterministic ending, but this is fixed with the optional auction rules. A fun game which represents what present-day board gaming is all about. A must have in any collection. Rating "9".

Update (07/24/2009): Managed to get this one out finally after being neglected for over a year. I only play the auction rules now, and also teach it first too. 15 minutes to explain, 2.25 hrs for a 4P game with two newbies and two veterans, so the 90 min play time is pretty sporty for first-timers. Still a great game--simple mechanics, yet very deep play, and satisfying board development.

Update (01/07/2011): Played the basic rules to accommodate a newbie; never again! How the tiles fall is deterministic--whomever is the first player will score first in the final scoring round; whomever is last, will score last, suffering a significant disadvantage. The rules regarding the last scoring round is clearly broken. Suggest that the turn order be lowest score gets to move and score first, similar to the Power Grid "worst goes first" mechanism. Otherwise, basic rules is a '6'.

Update (11/17/2014): Managed on 3 played in five years? Yes, the Analysis Paralysis could be aggravating. Yes, there's a problem with the scoring using the basic rules. I think it is a important and significant design, and I still want it in my collection, but my, my dear Tikal, you are showing your age with the action point mechanism. I don't know when I will have the urge to play this again. Dropping my rating down to "7".

[i]First game of the AP Trilogy.[/i]

This game changes dramatically with each added player—2, 3 & 4p games are all radically different in feel.  Best to play with a minute-timer or pre-agreed turn time limits—each turn has a mathematically optimal move which can take some people decades to find.  Better to force intuition with some form of timer.  Or public humiliation.

TWELVE YEARS LATER

For the love of God get 10 cubes or beads (if you're reading this it's a good bet you can simply stand up and walk straight to such a thing) so people can count down their AP (used here to mean "action points", not "analysis paralysis"—though they're easily confused, I know) to make the accounting more precise, especially during asterisk-inducing takesies-backsies.

Not my cup of tea, simply because it plays too slow.  Waiting for your turn with nothing else to do, because you cannot make your decisions without considering the moves of ALL other players, is the biggest downfall.  With 4, there is too much chaos.  With 2, it plays quite fast but there is usually not enough interaction. Three players seems to be the best spot for Tikal.  Good player interaction, reasonably short time (but still too long for my taste).

A really accomplished game that I would love to rate more highly because of the action point system, but in the end I find the AP-inducing requirement to optimise your action points just too frustrating.  For this reason it works well as a play by mail game, but it still doesn't quite work for me.  However, I do understand why people love Tikal, and I agree that the tile auction variant is an improvement.

Excellent game.  Great bits and design.  I favor tile laying and exploration and this game delivers in both.  Small element of luck but that adds to the suspense.  Only drawback is the number of movement and play options at the end of the game.  While it keeps it interesting, it can become overwhelming and intense.  No downtime, though, as you can study and get ready for your next move.  Very strong game.

UPDATE: Playing this a second time, everyone is more experienced and it turns into a more interesting area-control game with plenty of interesting things going on.

Playing this on SpielbyWeb is pretty easy as far as the calculations go.  However, understanding where points come from is really hard.  (2 plays)

I've only played this once. I played it with my wife and brother-in-law. This game is quite interesting and has a lot of choices. It can get frustrating at times, because you want to do more than the alloted action points will allow. 

You can also get screwed if you don't stake out your territory early and build camps deep in the jungle that allow you to explore quickly or get to areas of the board quickly. 

In the game I played, my b-in-law, dominated. It seemed to mostly be the luck of the tile draw and his ability to move his people quickly. 

I'd like to try this with two players and maybe with 4 to see if this changes the feel. 

Overall, I would say the game is a little long and by the end game(maybe because I wasn't doing well), I wanted it to end.

Finished my 2nd game of this on March 5th, 2007.  It was an on-line game at that.  I enjoyed this game, however I recall it taking forever live or on-line.  It takes a game play to figure out what the rules mean, how to play, and what strategy to use.  That being said, there is lots of strategy in this one.  Play when you have lots of time and your competition likes strategy games as well.  It's worth consideration for game plays when the chance arises, however you probably won't have much opprotunity to play it.

Oh, the transformation is almost complete...I admit it; I have Euros and I like them, damnit.  Tikal is appealing to me as a Euro for two reasons: it oozes with theme that is excellently intergrated, and the AP system is just nifty.  I can't say if I prefer the variant over regular play (though most swear by one or the other) but regardless, I think the game is solid, fun, and well themed.  So take that to note Euro companies.  We like themes!  Feed us atmosphere and we will buy no matter how mathy and stale the game!

I have come to the conclusion that I generally dislike action point systems. I find them tiring and non-interactive. I like games that have both quicker cycles between player turns, and also more chance to interrupt and interfere with opponent's. Tikal isn't horrible for this by any means, but the amount of choice on your turn veers towards paralyzing. If given my choice, I would much rather play Neuland to get a similar feel.

Finally got a chance to play this classic.  This is one euro-game that has a very strong theme with it.  It's fun to watch the jungle unfold and see your little meeples scamper across the landscape.

And of course there's the "Action-Point-Allowance System".  Yes, it allows for individual play styles.  Yes, it could drag game play down to a snail's pace.  I haven't played it with any AP  players, but I shudder at the possibilities.

In the end, my only big flaw with this game was the lack of ways to score points.  It's true you can each take your own paths, but each player is still just going to be claiming temples and treasures.  The temple fighting was at least entertaining, but it did lead to some difficult decision making when combined with action points.

One of the most exciting Action Point mechanic games. Comparing with other AP games, Tikal has more simple rules and concrete concepts to achieve victory. For this reason, the game progresses favorably and smoothly. Most of other AP games are horrible for long time thinking. Unlike other AP games, Tikal can slightly release players from pondering. Of course, this game also has some kind of limitations such as other AP games. Though, Tikal is still attractive in simple rule details and easy to make a plan. This is the best choice for someone who has apprehension on AP games. For me, Tikal is the best AP game.

giving this a 7 after 1 play. it was fun, could see it being a better game with 4 than with 3. also, can see how playing with the auction rules would make this a better game.

RATING: 8
Without auction, seems VERY unbalanced.  If one player gets to draw all the treasure tiles in the mid game (seen this both times I've played), they win.  That's broke

Update:  Played twice with auction and I can say it is a FAR superior game with the auction...rating 6 -> 8

RATING: 7
A real brain-burner of a game... unfortunately I've never won this game.  Too much analysis paralysis with the wrong players; because of this, I'd rather not play with four players.  Three-player games are problematic because two players end up competing for either temples or treasures while the third player racks up the other and wins.  Plays good with two.  The game board looks very pretty with all the hexes, temples, and explorers once the game is over.

(based on one play) An enjoyable game with an interesting theme.  I like the Action Point system, the random scoring rounds, and the exploration theme.  However, the game felt too long for what it was.  We played a game and agreed to end after a scoring round about half way through.  (That actually seemed about right and made for an enjoyable game)

Exploration:Area influence:Action point movement:Set collection:Auction(variant)

An excellent strategy game with an awesome theme and very little luck. Initial rating 2 plays but don't expect it to move much. This is a very well put together game with concise rules that are easy to learn and it comes with very high quality components, some of the best I have seen, even the insert in the box is PERFECT.

I think it will be best with 3 but it is still very good with only 2 players. 2 players is spread out with a 'little' less confrontation and 4 would be very interactive with fighting over everything. Not as prone to AP as some would say, potential is there but most times turns are taken quite quickly with only 2 at least. Auction rules spoil the exploration a little but make for more strategic play, so far I don't find it necessary, a little luck/randomness is welcomed to keep it interesting. I can see how it would make a bigger difference in a 3 or especially a 4 player game. We will be trying it just for variety sake. Love this game so far.

[u]UPDATE[/u]: Rating dropped a little after teaching a newbie the game. It was still a good game but longgg, 3 player has that much more AP vs. 2 player which had only a little, 4 must be bad and I wouldn't want to try it. The auction variant worked nicely with 3 and there were some good fights over temples. I think I prefer the 2 player game of this now though just due to it being too long for what it is with 3, more plays will tell. 

[u]UPDATE[/u]: 8.5 => 8 Dropped again, I only want to play this with 2 players and at the scale it is excellent, I could be convinced to play with 3 but won't suggest it (Tikal=2, Java=3, Mexica=4)

Lots of choices as the jungle expands before your eyes and you seek to find and control hidden temples and hidden treasures.  I think the theme works very well.  I start to empathize with my little explorers, sharing a sense of challenge and discovery.  For me, the AP problem really only comes up at the end, and I am notoriously prone to taking long turns during games.

Soort meerderhedenspel in de jungle. Elke speler heeft een team expeditieleden met een expeditieleider. In je beurt leg je een nieuwe zeshoekige tegel (met open plek, tempel, schatten of vulkaan), waardoor een stuk oerwoud ontgonnen wordt, en spendeer je max. tien actiepunten (expeditieleden op het bord brengen, schatten delven of ruilen, tempels ontdekken of bewaken, verplaatsen, of een kamp bouwen). Telkens een vulkaan tevoorschijn komt, volgt een scoreronde met punten per tempel waar je de meerderheid hebt, en voor schatten die je verzameld hebt. Tof spel, maar schatten leveren systematisch een groot voordeel op, waardoor punten (toch bij twee spelers) sterk uiteenlopend kunnen zijn.

Must play the auction version for the most fun and strategy as drawing all the good tiles in the regular game can really spoil it.This also takes the luck factor out of the game and makes it better.Might be good to play the non auction game with new players before moving on to auction version.

RATING: 6
I like this game and it plays pretty well to it's theme. Game can move slow or fast, depending on each players ability to quickly analyze their moves. Set a time limit if it's a problem. Should be played in about 1-1:45 hour. There is one dowside to the game though besides the downtime. You NEED to keep tabs on one another, if one player is left alone that player will run away with the game.  This can happen in particular when a newbie plays with 3 experienced players. Any which way you play, the auction version is definitely superior to avoid the luck of the tile draws. 

**Update** I'm not as enthralled with this game as I once was, I dropped the rating from 8 to 7 (12-2006)

**Update** I've played this a few times online since my last comments and I can't help but continue to like the game less and less. I like exploration games but this is much more about optimizing your actions than exploring. Dropped from a 7 to a 6.5 (10-2007)

**UPDATE** Just the thought of playing makes we wince. Dropped from a 6.5 to a 5 (12-2007)

Keep in mind, this isn't a bad game it's just REALLY worn thin for me.

Bought this at eBay and it didn't arrive at all. Seller claimed it got lost while in transit and promised to send a 2nd copy. 2 months have passed, Tikal is nowhere to be seen and seller not only ignored my e-mails but also unregistered from eBay. My very 1st (out of 2 at the time) unsuccessful eBay transaction.

Very Original. Good, but not great. The people who say this game takes too long must be WAY too serious about winning. It's true that there are 10 action points to be spent each turn but the actions are trivial like moving a guy one space. I do wish the game fit the theme a bit more. It's pretty abstract like El Grande. I Sold it.

This is probably my favourite game!  And here's the weird thing - I've never played the auction variant!!  It seems that every time I play this one I'm playing with new people so we play the easy rules.  One day.  A great action point game that can get slow if people are burning their brains every turn...but I use this time to try to 'help' my opponents by giving suggestions.  These usually will help me more in the long run!
Update: I've played the auction variant finally and it's even better!  I even convinced some players who didn't like the game too much to like it with the auction variant.

RATING: 6
Reasonably short eurogame.  You're competing teams of archeologists exploring the jungle and getting points for excavating temples and collecting artifacts.  The game is pretty simple with some interesting maneuvering as you place the tiles and try to establish control over temples while grabbing other people's temples that they have invested effort into excavating.  I enjoy the games in a faint sort of way.  There isn't a lot of richness to the strategies and there is a certain amount of screwing each other that is not my favorite thing.  The theme is reasonably well developed.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Tikal is an enjoyable take on area control that gives players multiple options and forces them to solve the dilemma of whether to work hard and improve the value of their controlled areas or simply stepping in and take the credit for new discoveries.

It has two major issues: the randomness of the tile draw and a tendency to run way longer than it should (especially due to new players) thanks to complicated moves. There is an auction variant in the manual that is strongly recommended - it fixes the first problem and improves the second by allowing players to start formulating plans while others are taking turns.

My initial impression was not good, but in fairness we played with 2 players, which wasn't much fun.  The next two games were with 4, and 3 players, and were much more enjoyable.  Stealing of the treasures is a nice touch.  There is luck involved with the tile draw, and although it can seriously affect your options for that turn, things seem to even out.  I have seen bad tile draws completely take someone out of the game, though.  My impression of this game has gone up every time I've played it.

Update:  Downgraded to a 6.  Analysis paralysis city.  It wasn't a problem when I only had a 15-game collection, but now there are less AP-prone games that I'd rather play.

A game about the discovery and excavation of the ruins of Tikal. Great game with a more solid theme than you usually see in German boardgames.

Beautiful components, too.

Tikal is a good game. Nowadays I prefer to play with the variant auction but it adds lots of downtime so I only do it if all players are fast players and they know the rules, otherwise we play regular Tikal which is also a blast.

In this form, there is some luck of the draw with the tiles, but I have found that the game still have lots of depth, so the most skillful player will win most often.  I’m downgrading its rating so it reflects my feelings for the game without any variant.

Tikal has a special place in my heart, it was the first game I played that used action points, so for me, it was very novel. Still, after all this time and after knowing many more games, I continue to come back to Tikal from time to time. I really enjoy it.

It features easy rules but very complex decisions (which is a problem with AP prone people).

It has beautiful art and when you finish the game, it looks gorgeous on the table. 

Current Rating: 7.0

You get ten actions points on a turn. Turn up a tile, place it where it extends the exploration region the best, and use your action points to move your workers, dig on temple and treasure sites, and establish a new base camp. Most workers on a dig site gets you the points, and digging makes it worth more.

Burn my brains. Caused me to 'fess up and make and buy an Analysis Paralysis microbadge.

Many options each turn. And you can plan for a few turns ahead. Decisions decisions decisions!

Extremely nice to look at too! There's a couple of minor things that grate against the theme.

I normally avoid this game as it is notorious for inducing AP and I prefer to play quickly.  Not bad, but I don't get the same enjoyment out of it that others seem to.  This is another example of the zero-sum flavor of area control that more often pisses me off than leads to a fun time.

What a cool game. I immediately liked it as the bits were very cool and it was easy to learn the rules. It really has the flavor of exploration and there's no dice rolling so that's a big plus. The advanced game eliminates the luck factor and makes the game more strategic. A Euro game that plays 2-4 people is a HUGE plus in my book as I don't have to go chasing around for a 3rd player. 
It got a 90 mph ride on my Harley bungeed between my solo seat and the license plate after I bought it. The Green guy on the front said it was "awesome"!

A nice exploration game using action points. We've been using the auction variant and Kramers varient rules of allowing each player 1 minute to make his move. Each player also has 6 "extra minute" chits, which he can use on any turn. At end game each unused chit is worth 3 points. This makes the game flow more smoothly.

Visually attractive game.  The action points concept is well executed here, and you feel like you have a million choices.  Good theme.  However, there isn't much you can do if another player decides to challenge your temples.  Also, it is pretty easy to beat down the leader, so it feels a bit like getting ahead early is pointless.  However, skill is definitely a strong factor in this game, and it is quite fun to play even if you aren't winning, or are playing it for the first time.

RATING: 6
Rated for the basic version. I enjoy this game, but I'm not yet sure how much. The action point system works fine, although I don't find it to be particularly inspiring. My primary issue: it seems very hard, if you are behind after the second scoring, to catch up. It is so costly and slow to move workers that only a very lucky tile draw would seem to be able to make up any ground - and where's the reward in that? There are so many options on each turn and yet, why do I feel like I only have a narrow channel of sensible options open to me?

Players have 10 action points to spend every turn on a variety of options, and the board never looks the same different tile placement produces all kinds of crazy pathways to navigate. That is by far the most interesting part of this game: it's a jungle out there, and figuring out how to best move around (and where other players are unlikely to follow) is a blast. 

Tikal is great casual fun, but (like lots of games) can be somewhat frustrating when expert and novice players are at the same table. The questions of "where, when, who, and to what extent" are tougher than they first appear. Probably the least obvious thing about this game is how aggressively the table needs to compensate against early or midgame leaders. There's an auction variant to remove the randomness (making such compensation explicitly required instead of implicitly necessary), but the intense brain-burn is too high a price to pay - I'd rather the players had a simple awareness of the randomness and what it means in practical terms. 

Recommended with four players.  

Tikal is the kind of game that makes me wonder if I need to go to a half-point rating system. 8.5 would be about right.

Players have ten action points each turn. Tiles are placed that have markings indicating the number of action points to pass through a side. Players move workers over the tiles to pyramids which they can then uncover to increase the value. Your workers may have to compete with other players to have control of a pyramid. Some tiles contain treasures and pairs and triplets give additional points. When a volcano comes out you have one more set of actions and then scoring occurs for the pyramids and treasures. I have played the board game and iPad versions and like both.

Game is played in sequence with each player laying down an adjacent hex tile - which depedning on how it's placed will allow you to explore the jungle.  This gameplay makes the map random everytime! Tiles are shuffled and players play first tile in the stack, then players have 10 points to maneuver. With these 10 points per turn, you are able to gain treasue, and temples, and explore the jungle.  The the game can change completely just from another another players move, strategy is very tough!

Loads of tension and player interaction. Limited action points leave you with though choices and turns that are challenging to optimize. 
The enjoyable decision points in this game are many:
-where and when to place out your tent(s)
-how strongly to fight for treasures
-how much to invest in a struggle to control a temple
-where to deploy your 'super' worker
-when to use the temple defence ability
-where to place map tiles

The rules are fairly straightforward but the game play is rich and dynamic. It's area majority at it's very best. 

There are few majority games as intense and exciting as this one, it's almost too good to have won the SdJ award! Seriously, it's that good.

Didn't like it when I played it once a few years ago. First online plays at SBW were enjoyeable although I got crushed. This didn't grow on me with more plays. Planning out your ten action points in one turn is like work. The game doesn't catch a flow for me. In FTF play this will heavily suffer from AP.

RATING: 7
Ellegant mechanics and very simple to play. Lot of strategical options here. You have 10 action points per turn to explore Tikal to get treasures and discover temples. You'll have to choose between some actions like move workers, establish a campament, dig for a treasure, etc... You can play it as an auction game too for a less-luck game!! Great theme.

A great area-control, tile-laying game. This game can create some very cool moments where the player stresses about maximizing points vs. sacrificing control to another player. The only downside is the downtime, as it can take awhile for others to play their turns. Could use some counters to track spending of action points.

I like this one.  Lots going on, lots of decisions on where to commit resources, how to make it tough to have your areas "conquered" and when to cap temples.  Very neat.  Yeah, AP can set in and I don't think its a critical failing.

Very attractive board and tiles.  I think that I'm not too into the exploration theme (except in a game like Lost Valley, where you have more choices of how to exploit the territory), and I can see how A/P is a big problem when you have 10 action points to spend.  5 is manageable (like in Torres), but I would be selective about my opponents, as I would not want the game to be drawn out.  I think this game merits further plays for me to give it a fair rating.

感想：
1. 相當喜歡的遊戲，主題性十足，是有探勘遺跡的感覺
2. 10個action的設定可能會令DOWNTIME時間比較長，而且對於新手可能要計算ACTION Point也比較困難。而且行動上有些點比較碎，可能學習時會有點辛苦。
3. 聽說完整的遊戲是有點時間拖太長的問題，BGG有同好分享了縮短GAME PLAY的設定，我直接就玩短版。聽說遊戲性分別不大，就是時間短一點。玩後的確也很足夠和滿足。
4. 雖然沒有什麼很特別的機制，但玩熟後整體感覺是流暢，而且好玩的遊戲。

Juego muy entretenido y sobre todo vistoso. No es nada complicado, una vez jugada la primera ronda se entiende facil el mecanismo. Aunque al principio se siente uno sobrecogido porque no sabe que hacer con tan pocos puntos de accion, y la sensacion de que tu exploradores van sn ton ni son por el tablero es muy posible. Uno del contras del juego es el tiempo de analisis-paralisis de cada jugador. Aunque hay alguna variante para evitar un poco esto. Divertido juego aunque puede que no convenza a todos.

Based on one play; three-player game.  Fun.  Lasted a little too long but two players were first-timers.  I could see where using a timer would perhaps enhance the game but the AP wasn't as bad as the reputation this game has for it.

RATING: 5
Unfortunately, the game's great bits and good thematic representation cannot overcome the AP that is common in this game.  With so many actions available, it always seems like you should be able to do more.  And it's almost impossible to plan your turns, since the new tiles can make so much difference.  Also, there is a lot of randomness, even in the auction variant, and it doesn't play less than four players very well.

Well-designed, and the first of the mask series I tried (went on later to Java). However...it's far too long for what it is!! It really drags, and yep, it's because of AP.

Igazán nagyon remek játék, a lapkalehelyezésre és az akciópontokra épülő játékmenet egyrészt nagy szabadságot, másrészt igazán feszes, izgalmas és eléggé konfrontatív élményt nyújt. A szabályok nagyon egyszerűek, de folyamatosan nehéz és fontos döntéseket kell hozni. Azért nem feltétlenül kezdő játékosoknak ajánlott.

If Power Grid is the Volvo of boardgaming (boxy but good), Tikal is the Volkswagen - less boxy, more jaunty, and a ton of fun. Tikal really feels like a game that came out in '99. That may seem less than complimentary, but I mean it in the best way possible. Tikal is simpler than any mid-weight Euro released in this century, but its depth remains unparalleled. A fairly long game, but it flies by. Elegance in design, a modern classic.

You get the feel of directing a bunch of explorers finding treasures and building up temples (I know you're digging down and uncovering layers but because the tiles are stacked, if feels like you're building "up"). Much better than Mexica. I've never tried Java.

Fun game with a theme that grabs me.  I find the ten action points per turn mechanic challenging and fun.  The luck of the tile draw can help you or kill you in this game, but overall it does present a few strategic vs tactical choices that make it interesting.  I'd like to play the bidding variant now that it is available on SBW.

Played as 2-player game, and liked it. With 2 you don't have to compete over the same points (unless you want to), which makes this a good game to play with the wife ;) 
With 3 and 4 conflict cannot be avoided, but the game still is good. I'm not inviting AP-prone players to try this, as I'd like to keep on liking this..

Played it 2 times. Overall the appeal is great, exploring unknown jungles, collecting mysterious objecs, excavating temples, all is done in a great thematically fitting setup.  A nice surprise from Ravensburger, and much ahead of its time, it feels more like a modern game, considering the pieces, material and artwork.

-1 game setup a bit time consuming and much stuff on the table.
-1 in the end it does not matter much what you did, although the moments you did decide whether to build a camp or not or to excavate or not, did feel like fun. But something somewhere is missing here I believe.

A beautiful game, both aesthetically and in design. Well-themed and very deep strategically. The only thing keeping it from a higher rating is the high level of analysis paralysis that seems to prevent the game from being played in less than 2.5 hours. Additional plays with four players have made me aware of the increasning downtime in the last two-three turns of the game. Egg timers, anyone?

I was initially very impressed with this 1999 Spiel des Jahres winner --- much more depth and complexity than I have come to expect from that award, and an excellent feeling of exploration mirrored by the beautiful artwork serves to create a much more unified theme than in the majority of German games.

UPDATE: Having played it a few more times, I still feel like the payoff is not quite enough.  It's definitely heavier than other SdJ winners, and the theme/artwork is evocative.  But I hate the sort of boring count-out-how-many steps you can take out of 10.  Worker placement seems like all the rage these days (and this game did it earlier and better), but it's still a mechanic that seems too much like being an accountant.  I want to be Indiana Jones in the jungle, not the dude who sends 8 men exploring by radio!

My rating has settled for now at a 6.

The game's design is clean. The main mechanism is really clever. The game plays smoothly and area control combined with exploration is unlike any other game I've played. Great. 

But I hate the artifacts thing. So much that I got rid of the game. This mechanism is random, broken and unnecessary for me. It ruins the whole game. I'm also not a big fan of the artwork but it's... merely ok. So that's my opinion. 2 thirds of the game are amazing and one third is terrible- too terrible. Too bad. This could have been a wonderful game :(

Excellent theme and beautiful artwork make what would have been a rather drab game so much better. Not to say that Tikal is only art and theme, it has plenty of excitement but I know that the deep thinking and long turns can bore some people. Very worthwhile to individuals who believe quiet thought and slowly sipping their favorite beverage is a perfect way to spend the evening... despite the fact that this has elements of an 'adventure' style game.

On another note, I'm still trying to figure out why you start the game as archeologists exploring ruins to suddenly laying claim as rulers of the found temples. It's as though a 'curse' takes over and your scientists transform into old Mayan gods or rulers. Odd things in theme like that tend to bug me.

Tikal WAS a great game when it was a new title. A lot of tactical maneuvers, thinking and challenges. And look at those beautiful components and gameboard! 
But time has gone at this game has lost it's greatness: 
1) it just takes too much time
2) there is too much downtime (AND very rarely you can think your movements beforehand)
3) basic game is a bit too unbalanced, because the tile-luck has a big role. AND if you play with advanced rules this game takes even more time!!!

RATING: N/A
Tikal is a game of exploration within the Central American jungles in search of lost temples and the treasures within. Players send their team of explorers into the jungle, exposing more and more of the terrain. Along the way, you find temples that require further uncovering and treasures. Players attempt to score points for occupying temples and holding onto treasure.

The scoring phases are great to tally and secure points.  It is unique in this aspect, that one temple may render you points on a scoring phase, then another player can take over and score on the same temple.  

I highly enjoy the energy points to spend with each turn.  It allows you to manage and calculate best strategy.  

As the map unfolds there is some control as to how to isolate high scoring areas for yourself by making them monumentally difficult to travel too.  But, you can possible counter that too.  

It is well worth the 1 1/2 hours to play.

[2007.Jan.3] One of the "Mask Trilogy" action point games by veteran designers Kiesling & Kramer; the others being Java and Mexica. Not quite as heavy as Java is, this game is slightly more prone to analysis paralysis (for those who tend to suffer from this terrible gamer's affliction). A beautifully rendered romp through the jungles of Central America, what more could an Indiana Jones wannabe want? Gather up your jacket, hat, revolver, and whip you're gonna need 'em!

In this game you get to be archaeologists on an expedition to uncover mayan temples and treasures.  It's a fun game if you change the rules a little bit.  The original game is too luckish and ong.  We play with instant scoring (no scoring rounds) and use the medium length game that removes twelve tiles.  This way it is the same game but only takes half an hour!  Fun mechanics, nice board and pieces.  Nice medium light game.

Good game that actually is rather easy to teach as well.  Using the ole info card to run down how the game works makes the game simple to learn and play although it can still take a lot of time for people to decide how best to spend their 10 action points each turn.  I prefer the auction variant but both methods of playing the game are fun.  I do think its best with 4 people as conflict can almost be avoided if played with 2 or 3.

Azt hiszem ez a kedvenc játékom. Szeretem benne, hogy egyrészt szép, bele lehet élni magam a témába, másrészt pedig hogy nehéz. 10 cselekvési pont. Sok is és kevés is. Megtehetem ezt is, azt is, meg amazt is, de ezek közül csak egyet vagy kettőt, és nehéz kiválasztani, hogy mire költsem a 10 pontot. Nagyon jól eltalált, élvezetes játék. Lehet benne gonoszkodni (ellopni a másik kincseit, elfoglalni a feltárt piramisait, vulkánkitörést intézni a tábora szomszédságában, stb.), de lehet tök békésen, konfrontáció nélkül is játszani. Én optimálisan próbálok játszani, ami elég nagy agymunkát igényel, de hát épp ezt élvezem benne... És hogy nem a szerencsén, hanem tisztán a taktikámon és az ellenfelek taktikáján múlik, hogy ki kerül ki győztesen, hisz a játékosok ugyanabban a dzsungelben ugyanolyan lehetőségekkel játszanak (főleg a profi változatban).

A játék 2, 3 és 4 játékossal is teljesen jól működik, ugyanolyan stílusú marad, a holtidő (amíg a többi játékos lép) nem unalmas (hiszen érdekes a többiek cselekvéseit követni), és a játéktér sem rendeződik át annyira, hogy az zavaró lenne akár egy picikét is. Most csak egyetlen a játékosszámtól függő eltérést érzek: több játékosnál nagyobb lehet az igény a Profi játékra, amikor a terepkártyákat nem csak véletlenszerűen húzzuk, hanem licitálunk értük. (De ezt még nem próbáltam.)

Update: A játékostársam legutóbb egész kellemetlenül játszott, ráadásul sikeresen: egy 10 szintes piramisomat két értékelésnél is megkaparintotta. Így, hogy - bár nem teljesen szándékosan - agresszívan játszott, sokkal nehezebb volt a játék, kihívás. Élveztem nagyon. 9 -> 10 pont.

Tombraider, the boardgame. Only, instead of all the shooting, you really have your underlings dig stuff up (somehow, the digging works the wrong way around here, but that doesn't matter), securing digging sites and defiling hidden temples. If too many volcanoes break out, everybody goes home. Still, a solid game.

Many have compared Tikal and Java. In short, they're both different enough to warrant playing on their own, but both similar enough that if you can play one, you can easily learn the other.

I am very impressed with this one. While it can, indeed, lend itself to analysis-paralysis, this can be avoided by explaining basic strategies to newcomers, as well as having a more liberal "table talk" mentality about helping someone who is stuck in a rut. This works well because of the scoring system and variety of scoring options, meaning that helping someone else will not generally hurt you.

An interesting area-control game. The theme holds it together, but is minimalist in affecting gameplay; it could easily have had a pirate theme, or Egyptian pyramids.

I'm a bit disappointed. People are complaining about down-time and they are right. Although Tikal is a territory control game at its heart, which would imply lots of interaction, you actually wait patiently for your turn and then decide what to do - there's no other strategy anyway since the board is constantly changing and your opponents can make very different moves from what you've expected. I've spent around half the time OFF the table (I was playing at a local gaming club, so I could watch other games) and completely ignored what the others were doing and finished second anyway - I could have won - not if I were watching the game more closely, but if I hadn't wasted my time fighting over one temple and concentrated on gathering more treasures instead... In one word: boring. Although definitely not a bad game - just not my cup of tea.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a great game. However the downtime can kill this it. You have 10 action points each turn and there are many ways to use it. AP players will definitely drag the downtime to painful levels so maybe you need some sort of time limit to truly enjoy this game with 4 people. Nevertheless, if you can get through the downtime, this is a very good game and highly competitive in nature.

Invested in a copy recently as I wanted the entire mask trilogy. I'm hoping my tastes have evolved into seeing how good this game realy is.

Update:

Years later I play again and finally see some good in Tikal. It's still my least favorite of the series, and the annoyance that is "player to your left flips a tile with tokens, everyone takes them before you can get any" puts a cramp in my enjoyment.

I also think the game is VERY dependent upon the skill of the players and how well they place the tiles.

Very good game.  I have only played it in two-player.  Plays pretty quick, relative to comments (1 hour and 15 minutes), but we play fast.  A lot to think about.  How to place the tile and how to use your 10 actions.  It is different from a lot of my other games, which is good.

RATING: 7
This is a fine and beautiful game with a lot to think about.  Managing your workers is a challenging experience.  MY only beef is that it tends to take a little long to play (and that becomes worse with players who want to take a long time over each turn).  As a result, we have never played the auction version which certainly LOOKS interesting, but appears impractical.

As an update and addendum, after playing the 4 player game with random draws, it is a lot more possible with more players for someone to get a poor run of draws (or, conversely, a very good set), skewing the game to the lucky player, which seems wrong for a game of this type.  The auction would alleviate that, so is probably the way to go for a full 4 player game.  With 2, each player sees half the tiles, making the unlucky draw much less of a factor.  There the extra length does not give the better game.

So long as played with people who don't suffer too terribly from analysis paralysis, this game is one of my favorites by far.  It's so engrossing, and a really pretty game, it really transports you to the jungle.  Of course, once you're there, you're basically robbing the place of cultural artifacts to send to some foreign museum, but that's another story!!  :-)

An exploration game where you are discovering pyramids in Tikal and building them up to score more points.  You flip tiles as you explore the game board.  An interesting point allocation system where you have a number of actions you can take and use your 10 allocation to points to take as many actions you want.  

I really like this game.  It is very well done and I like the point allocation system a lot.  Family friendly game that is medium weight.

Old game, old fashioned. 1 of the best examples of Action Point System, also demonstrates its weakness: AP prone. Most games nowadays would have a short playtime once players familiarise with the game, not for this game as players need to consider much more with the limited action points. The basic game is just too long considering its random factors, and would be much prolonged if played with the advanced (drafting) rules.

Agonizing decisions due to the limited "action points" avaible. Plays well with 2 (with more players downtime may kill fun, depending on how fast you're able to play). Use the "advanced version" (auctioned tiles) to reduce luck.

One of the best games that blends the theme into the game play.  If you understand the theme, you will know how the game play works.  Very few games do that as well as Tikal.  Plus I like how you can directly mess with the other players.  Too many Euros do not have directly conflict between the players.  The fact that Tikal does is a plus for me.

We love this game. It has a wonderful balance between luck and strategy. The area control mechanism is fun and challenging - using the tablets between tiles to help "fend off" competitors so that you can guard palaces with the fewest men. At times the treasure seems like the key to the game - get the most and you will win - but as soon as you try to rely on that, someone will win handily without much treasure. Tikal plays great with two, three, or four players. WIth two it is more controlled, as you can better understand your opponent's strategy. With four it is more chaotic, as you have folks coming at you from all directions. Overall, we enjoy the game more every time we play it. At least for the time being, we think it is one of the best.

Explore the jungle and conquer temples you find on your way. Defend them and grow them. 
Rules are simple but you have enough options and freedom to make this a very hard game to win. Wonderfully designed game mechanics and the game components look appealing. 

Spend your action points intelligently !
Only minus is the length of the game. Sometimes that feels too long, especially when you play with people that tend to think very long before they make a move. That can result in a lot of down time in which you can do nothing, when you play with 4.

Minus: 3 (duration, downtime) - [-1]

I was very pleased to finally find a copy of this for sale at an online retailer, as my own FLGS couldn't seem to get it.  I love the theme, and the game itself is beautiful.  Very easy to play, with hidden complexities that are surprising.  I also enjoy the necessary strategy needed for victory.  The only drawback is how long it takes to put the game away!  However, the box insert is well designed and holds everything neatly.  Another winner from Rio Grande!

UPDATE:  Several plays later, I've raised my rating.  I love this game!

2005 Comments:

I remember back in 1999 when Rio Grande Games was still a small fish in a big pond of game manufacturers'. Jay had had a few well recieved games in the previous 2 years with the likes of Samurai, Bohnanza, Kahuna, Mississippi Queen, Canyon and Lowenherz (which are all very good), but in 1999 his list of published games tripled and Rio Grande started to earn the stellar reputation he now has in the gaming world. In those days, you could buy just about ANY RG game and know that you were going to have a good time. Tikal was definately one of those games.

I was very fortunate to hear that Jay was going to be at Match Play in Mountain View during the weekly Wednesday nite game session and I had already heard a little about Tikal at that time on rec.games.board (BGG was not even around at this time). I went to game night and was thrilled to meet Jay and I got to talk with him at length about his games and even bent his ear about my  own game I was designing at the time (and still am!).

When it was time to play, I mentioned that I really was interested in trying Tikal and Jay obliged and pulled out his brand spanking new copy of it. He went through the rules in a few minutes and got us up and running as he watched the first few turns to make sure we were ok before teaching another game to the next group. 

Tikal was amazing. I had never seen anything like it. The board and artwork were simply stunning, even to this day I would be hard pressed to mention another game with such beautiful components. What really impressed me however, is how involved the game was. EVERY turn was agonizing as you dont have enough action points to do everything that you want to do. There is a brilliant balance of methods to earn victory points and the scoring rounds themselves were unique in that all players took a turn "during" another players turn.

Jay came up at one point when one of the guys was taking a long time to take a move and simply said "This is a fast paced German game". We had no more problems after that and I've used that line every time I've taught the game and our group doesnt suffer from the curse of Analysis Paralysis like others seem to have with Tikal.

The other thing that I love about this is the THEME which is elegantly woven into the gameplay. You really feel like you are Indianna Jones and you are searching for the Ark of the Covenant. I can't see this game using any other setting and still being as big of a success as it is. I will never turn down a game of Tikal.

This was the 1st game I played that used action points and I immediately fell in love with the intense gameplay and multitude of options each turn that the game provides. It always seems that I never have enough action points for what I want or need to do - a sign of great game design. This one has beautiful graphics and the theme is integrated into the game nicely.

I really like this game.  The action points system leaves a WIDE range of options open, and there are lots of decisions to be made on every turn.  I find the decision complexity here to be significantly less than in K-K's Java, and that's a good thing (and I tend to like decision-rich games a lot).  I still haven't tried the auction variant, but intend to.

Use a timer if you're worried about analysis paralysis, which is a risk here.  I think playing fast fits the theme of a race to discover and control the most valuable sites/artifacts anyway.

The game looks great on the table, too.

RATING: 6
Slightly better with the simpler, non-auction rules, but my games have had way too much downtime & analysis-paralysis to be enjoyable. I also think action points are an uninspired game mechanic (it was outdated in wargames 20 years ago).   Update: And yet, years after I wrote the above, I now own the game. Playing online at SpielByWeb helped, and so did my kid's interest in the Mayan ruins subject matter.   Update: And yet, now I've traded it along, my copy unplayed. It just wasn't going to be played, even by my son. And my play-by-web experienced have reconfirmed my dissatisfaction with all of the min-maxing the game requires.

2-4p, 120m.   The bits and map look neat.  Dare I say beautiful?  Why did I not buy the dusty old Ravensberger edition at Puzzle Zoo in 2005?
I finally got to play this July 2006, and it is just OK.  Typical Wolfgam Kramer action point system, which leaves me a bit dry.  Though I must say part of my disenchantment was that we played the auction variant with 4 players, causing it to drag into 3 hours.  The down time between turns is fairly significant since there is so little player interaction, so it might be better with fewer players.

Highly strategic and beautiful. The variable board makes no two games feel the same. The best strategy game for multiple players that I have played.

Rating based on 3 & 4, using standard rules.

I really, really see why AP-prone players should stay away from this game (Tikal has a rep), but as long as you play with people who play from the gut (at least in the early going) it's a good & fun game with simple rules, lots of freedom, and some thinky bits. It's kind of like a competitive Pandemic, where most of the game revolves around the logistics of getting from one place to another using a set number of action points. It's quite satisfying to pull of an efficient combo of moves and gain yourself a slew of points. 

I think the main thing about this game is to realize that there is a fair amount of luck involved in the tile draw, so play this in a relaxed way and you'll have more fun. If you worry to much about playing perfectly, not only will you get bogged down with AP but you'll get more upset by the feeling it's not balanced. (I would NOT want to play with the auction variant, btw, which solves the luck problem but would dial the AP-proneness to the max)

Not sure about this one. I almost feel like I had some fun in spite of the game. It seems to have all the basic required ingredients to make a Euro interesting - some unpredictability, randomness and player interaction. But the analysis paralysis problem with this is not overstated, it just eats time and can become very boring between turns. I'm also not sure that the apparent game weight isn't fake and that a lot of the game comes down to which treasures and which tiles you draw.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Lovely game which allows a few paths to victory. Scoring rounds are semi-randomly triggered, but you get to take a turn before scoring. Lots of interaction and can even be a bit vicious. Some potential for AP and a player can try to 'wall off' a section of board to themselves.

Auction variant doesn't interest me, I get plenty out of the normal game. Now I want to acquire Java!

Bought the new Super Meeple edition and sold my old copy.

The game board and bits are beautiful and the theme's decent. Somehow it didn't work with two players, you're too preoccupied at your own corner of the jungle. But with four players, I can see the potential in this when the explorers get to be really cutthroat! [Got from Thrifty Secret Santa 2010]. Played four players and auction variant, mighty improvement, rating raised from 8 to 9.

Ah, action points.  I like it that I can do multiple things in a turn in different combinations as long as I have points left to do them.  I like this game much better than Mexica.

RATING: 7
Game is good with quick play, intolerable with AP. After several games on SPW I've confirmed what I always suspected, there's no real reason for AP in this game. The choices you're presented with aren't that difficult. If somebody is playing slow then that is just ruining the game for no additional benefit. Often your first instince for your turn is right, if you just did it you'd be fine and everyone would enjoy the game more. The non-auction game is faster but luck of the draw can truly hose you. So it depends on what you're playing for. I'd prefer the non-auction varient with fast players.

Great theme – hello Indiana Jones! I love Action Point mechanics. I like that you have multiple ways to get points and that there is some randomness to the game. The game is full of tension and you can have conflict if you want. There’s really no bash the leader though. The board, components and rulebook are good. I love that’s it’s not another “push the cubes” Euro. 

It doesn’t take long but the action points can lead to AP problems. The treasure part is nice, but might be the biggest source of randomness and letdown though (expensive to trade for what you get). 

I definitely like this game more than any of my friends or playgroup and I don’t know why.

Definite oldie but goody.  It's an area control game with periodic mad scrambles to score points based on majority, resulting in constant tension between expansion and consolidation with an eye toward what your opponents are doing and whether you want to challenge them or seek out your own territories.  Excellent game.

Played this for our game group's 11th anniversary. I really like this game. The board is beautiful and thematic enough that you feel like you are pillaging the virgin forest for treasure. Certainly a nice amount of theme considering most Euros! There is also a nice amount of "take that" gameplay, but not enough to put off those who dislike confrontation. Enough options for strategy, but not so much that it is a complete brain burner. Spatially, it was a bit hard for me to see all the options. However, by the end of the game I was getting the hang of where to move my explorers and what temples to raid. Overall a very fun game and I look forward to playing again!

A well-designed old school euro with legit player interaction. You actually have to read the intentions of other players (think T&E, El Grande, Ra, Princes of Florence) and can't be afraid to play a little nasty.

The art is well done and the insert is fantastic, if you care about those sorts of things.

Initial rating of 8 based on first play (four players, no auctions).

Upgraded to a 9 after a three-player game with auctions, which I found to be superior, even if perhaps less thematic.

09/29/99 Bought. Probably the most beautiful boardgame I own. Clear rules. The only downside is with less than four people the players tend to spread out, and there isn't enough competition. I fixed that by devising a variant in 2001 that removes some tiles. Its posted on the MeetUp page for Fort Worth Gamers at http://www.meetup.com/FortWorthGamers/pages/Tikal_variant_for_2_and_3_players/ . Its been downloaded over a thousand times.  
I never played the auction version until my 38th game. Its not fair to a newbie, and there always seems to be one at the table. Plus I was afraid it would add some length to the game. 
As of 06/21/17 I've played 65 games.

Tikal is the original of "The Mask" trilogy.  It's also my least favorite even it's still quite fun.

The main reason why it's my least favorite is because it's the longest of the 4 "mask" games, if I include Torres which isn't a real "mask" game.

With that said, Tikal is a very good game and I would love to play again.  The 10 action points are perhaps what makes Tikal a bit longer to play out than the other ones.

Now here's a game after my own heart. Open the box and there's a slot for everything, even the rule book. Hex-shaped holes for the hexes.

The game mechanics are fine and its fun to play now and then, but there are things that haven't been thought through carefully.

Pretty easy to grasp game, though not one for a whole lot of table talk (at least for my group). It is neat how you can see your decisions unfold on the table; you see what you need to do in subsequent turns to get back into the game.  You do need to be equally good at all three of the ways to score points to win, though. Play a balanced game and you will succeed.

Well-designed, thoughtful game has players exploring the jungle.  The big problem some have with this one if that each turn players receive 10 action points to spend that can bog down into analysis paralysis.  I haven't had this issue as I've only played on SBW, which seems to be a perfect fit for such a game.  The gameplay is challenging as each player is vying for a limited number of points which are earned by both collecting treasure and having the majority at a temple when the board is scored.  My favourite mechanic is that each player takes turns scoring: which means that even though you have a majority at a temple you may want to add more explorers to it to keep others from scoring it on their round.  Additionally, you may want to place an explorer on a temple that you won't score (because of a tie, etc.) to force others to use their valuable action points in order to score it on their turn.  Their really are a ton of ways to spend your action points and ultimately it's a contest in efficiency.

This is a great game that I wish I could play more often.  I probably wouldn't have even known about it if it hadn't won the Spiel des Jahres.

in Tikal players are archeologists digging in the jungle for treasures and temples.  Each turn the player takes a new hex piece to add to the board as the discovered area.  These pieces will either be empty, or more commonly they will have some buried treasure or a temple.  After placing the piece the player has 10 action points to spend.  These can be spent by bringing out new people, moving them, digging temples (making them worth more points during scoring), digging up treasures, building a tent (used to give you access further away from the start point as the board gets larger), or claim a temple outright for yourself.  Mixed throughout the hexes are volcanoes, these represent scoring rounds.  Whoever draws the volcano gets to first take 10 action points to position themselves to score.  You score based on treasures you have, and temples you have the majority at.  After scoring the next player gets their 10 actions to score with, and so on.  In this manner it is possible for all players to score at the same temple, after the first player takes majority and scores, the second player could then take over majority and score it and so on.

This is a great game with a lot of options.  Most of the time you don't have a clear option as to what your best move is.  Because of this AP prone players may cause the game to slow down a bit.  This was a great SDJ choice and I love it when I get a chance to play it.

Played once with 4, no auction.  Very pretty game.  Quick turns and lots of fun min-max-mathy fun.  We didn't use a single guard in our game, which I'm assuming was poor play, but that's how it worked out.  We dug up treasures very quickly so half way through the game they were all gone.  Not sure if that was good or bad.  I'm assuming the auction-variant would be a lot more complex, though I'm not sure I'd want to bid VP's on tiles most of the time?  I enjoyed it.  It was neat how the scoring round worked so that everyone had a chance to score after each of their turns, that helped to prevent anyone from really getting screwed which was kinda nifty.  You can kind of use a general strategy most of the time, and then really concentrate on scoring rounds to squeeze the most points out that you can.  It really helps the game flow.

* Classic action point Euro with a treasure-hunting theme (part of the [i]Mask Trilogy[/i])
* Plethora of actions at one's disposal can lead to severe AP (analysis paralysis)
* Players walk a fine line between discovering/plundering and restocking workers
* Several rounds of scoring, but falling behind early is usually insurmountable
* Gameplay is somewhat thematic, as the board is "discovered" as the game progresses
* Good for 2 (more tends to drag) and those who enjoy the action point mechanic

This is a great game and I've really enjoyed the two player games I've had with my wife. Four player is also quite good, but the game can bog down a bit depending on who is playing.

A great area control type of game where players control a group of workers exploring the Jungles of Tikal and unearthing temples and treasure to score points. I thought this game was going to be complicated but to my surprise the rules were simple and clear but the gameplay is deep and complex, which makes for a worthwhile and fun game. The action point system is the best I have encountered thus far. Even with the myriad of choices to do it doesn't seem to reach the "Analysis Paralysis" level that other games may warrant. There can be lots of player interactions as well as other players try and steal away points and treasures from each other. Highly recommended!

Nem mai darab Kramer-Kiesling páros SdJ díjas játéka, de még ma is megállja a helyét a könnyebb stratégiai játékok között.

A játékosok egy-egy régészekből álló csapattal játszanak (1 vezetőt és 18 régészt fognak mozgatni a játék során) és fedezik fel a maják ősi városát, Tikalt. A cél minél több kincset gyűjteni és templomot feltárni. A zsákmányon azonban nem osztozhatnak a csapatok, az erősebb (többségben lévő) viszi a maják rejtett aranyát.

Újrajátszhatósága magas a moduláris tábla miatt, a szabályzata pár perc alatt tanulható. Minden körben 10 akcióponttal gazdálkodhatunk, miután letettük az új területlapkát (ha az vulkán, akkor értékelő kör következik, amiből egyébként 3 van a játék közben, a játék végi értékelésen kívül). Akciók:
- embereink táborba helyezése: 1 pont / régész
- régész mozgatása: 1 pont / kőtábla
- templom feltárása: 2 pont / szint
- kincs kiásása: 3 pont / kincs
- kincs cseréje másik játékossal: 3 pont / kincs
- templom őrzése (csak ha többségben vagyunk az adott mezőn): 5 pont
- tábor építése: 5 pont

Kb. ennyi, persze van néhány finomság még benne, de tényleg gyorsan megtanulható, illetve nagyon jók a játékosok segédtáblái, amiken néhány piktogram a teljes szabálykönyvet leképezi.

Családi és gamer játéknak is kiváló (van profi szabályváltozata is, amiben licitálás megy a területlapkákért, illetve kicsit más a pontozás is).

Egyik kedvenc.

Second hand

We bought this one quite recently second hand because we heard a lot of good things about it. Tikal is a nice mixture of playing tiles (cfr Carcassonne), area control (cfr El Grande) and action points (cfr Pandemic). These three combined, make it a real classic board game.

The rules are relatively easy. You need some luck with the tile drawing (at least in the basic game) and the treasure hunting but it is definitely a strategic game where you need to concur for the best temples in the rain forest! A joy to play, also with 2 players but it is a little bit too long especially with more players.

I like the idea of exploring a map and uncovering more pieces during the course of the game. After finishing the game all players' scores are usually close.

Try it before you buy it.

Fun game where you try to maximise the amount you can do on a turn but always come up short.  Games are typically really close and come down to one or two good moves to separate you in points with the competition.

-Lots of options in a turn

It wasn't that bad actually, but I do think there are games out there that are just as thinky as this one, but with easier rules and with much less options to do in your turn. Yes, many options will cause a game more often then no to be more strategical, but I rather have games where you can do just a couple of things it make it a really hard choice of what you want to do. The many options also make it that you have to wait quite a while for your turn.

What I really liked was the area control, which I will try to play more games of now.

As I've played more Kramer and Kiesling games, I've gotten to the point that I'm not the biggest fan of their action point-driven system that they usually utilize. However, I think Tikal is the best implementation of that system. The 10 points you get from round to round feels like a lot, and it can seem overwhelming at times, but I really like it. You have just enough freedom to do what you want, but you still have to really puzzle out your turn. Definitely avoid this with AP prone players though. The game already runs a touch too long for what it is, but I still think it holds up really well. I'm not a fan of the micro-managed stack of tiles though

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
The finest achievement by Kramer & Kiesling? The gameplay is deceivingly simple - use action points to move explorers, build temples and claim treasures. But there is a logistical challenge to decide when and where to add explorers. And there is a competitive challenge to decide which temples to claim majority around and which to give up to your opponents. And there is even a cooperative challenge to decide which temples to extend and which treasures to trade without giving away benefits to your opponents.

I particularly like how the scoring round allows each player to act before scoring, making your own positioning more important than timing dependent on other players' actions. Some people think AP may be an issue but I believe that intuition to predict where the best scoring opportunities will be is more important than raw optimization. The modular board and the dynamic gameplay makes every new game feel fresh.

First impressions: This may be a little too mean for me. I like the tile placement and set collection elements, and the look of the game, and I even like the action point system. But it feels like the battles for control for the temples just sort of takes over. Now, that is mitigated somewhat since scoring happens on different turns for each player, so in theory both players can score for any given temple, but in practice it's easy for one player to do all the work and the other player to get the points. It's a problem a lot of worker placement games have, but I just don't care for that element so much.

Tikal provides a range of interesting decisions and player interactions. Adherence to theme is excellent which is upheld by quality components and striking artwork. The game can become quite intense with 4 players with everyone battling for control of the best scoring positions. Scoring rounds can slow to a crawl due to analysis paralysis as there can be considered an "optimum solution" in terms of maximum point potential. Each game can play out quite differently to the last but replay-ability could have been further expanded had a third means of scoring points been incorporated. Despite these small misgivings, Tikal is great fun and it is most enjoyable to watch your expedition workers explore the jungle and fight for the greatest discoveries.

Still have to try auction version, which might improve score, but overall the game just didn't grab me.  The actions available each turn were uninteresting for the most part, and after laying five or so tiles I was bored.

Good. What a beautiful game! After you start exploring the jungle and temples begin to appear before your eyes, you discover the magic of this game. Highly recommended for family groups, because of its simplicity to learn, and highly recommended also for any thematic game fan. The only issue about this game are the playing time ( About two hours) and a LOT of downtime during gameplay.

I feel kind of bad for rating this so low, it's not a bad game. But there are just such better ones out now that deal with similar mechanics in a much more interesting and elegant way, that I can't imagine ever CHOOSING to play this. However, there's really nothing wrong with it, and I would not turn down a game.

Played a 3-player game once. Action point system is not my cup of tea. It gets a bit repeatitive during the game and long down time plus a lot of analizing makes this game not playable too often. I don't think I want to play it with 4...

RATING: 8
Vibrant. Easiest game of the Mask-trilogy to get the hang of, but not as rewarding as Mexica. It plays faster than I expected.  Even if there's some different action to chose from every turn, analysis paralysis (AP) is a non-issue in my experience (much more of an issue in Mexica), but in a four-player game prepare for some down-time even without severe cases of AP. Not as dry and abstract as the other Java/Mexica. I don't like the randomness of when the point scoring phases are launched and how big an impact seating order has in that.

Analysis Paralysis is a player problem, not a game problem.  That said, Tikal is a game during which certain player problems can easily arise.  I've never found it to be a major issue, though.  Even though I'm not much good at it, Tikal is my favorite of the Knizia and Kiesling action point games, beating Mexica by a slim margin and Java by a slightly less slim margin.

RATING: 7.8
Definitely a classic, and still rather unique all these years later (even the other Kramer/Kiesling action point allowance games don't quite feel the same). Inspires both a feeling of cooperative exploration as each new tile is drawn and a sense of competition as players position said tiles to manipulate roads and muscle in on pyramids for points. The 10 Action Points per player per round can indeed result in AP among some, but with decisive players the game plays very smoothly and more than makes up for thinking time spent in tactical possibilities.

A great game that you won't want to play with APers! The theme feels well represented and the strategy and tactics are varied and fun. I actually prefer to draw the tiles randomly, rather than have an auction for each one. I know it adds some randomness into the game, but it takes a good hour or more off of the playing time - a sacrifice I'm very willing to make.

Nice screw you mechanics and cumulative difficulty/tension. The jungle exploration theme is very well fleshed out and fits in so nicely with the mechanics. I'm not crazy about building but this game also offers strategic placement, a little randomness, not too much, and a really well-balanced # of actions/turn system. But all this doesn't justify just how much I enjoyed the game, I  believe that it was really the theme that did me in.

RATING: 5
I like Tikal's board and hexes, but the temples are fiddly and the choice of player colors are downright ugly. 

Gameplay really shifts as components wind down. As temple upgrades and treasures vanish the area control aspect of the game becomes top priority.

Scoring rounds are a bitch in 2-player, in a 4-player game they can only be worse. Players each get a chance to outdo one another before scoring. The count-up can be difficult due to the sporadic placement of workers.

I honestly don't know if I like Tikal. It is designed well enough, but I don't think I like its gameplay.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This game oozes atmosphere. This game actually started me collecting boardgames (though at a low rate;)). An often heard complaint is that the downtime can be long. However, I thurroughly enjoy watching other players go mad on what to do next with their 10 points. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
In Tikal you are trying to discover different areas of the board and build your pyramids onto the hexes while also digging for treasure.  Every turn you have 9 action points to use, and a bunch of different actions to choose from with varying degrees of AP costs.

The system is tight and lends itself to some analysis paralysis, but it is a great game that is a joy to play.

It's of the same ilk as Die Macher & El Grande -- multi-player vying for area majority -- which is really not a style I like. Even though the tampering comes at a cost, the mechanic of tampering is one that I just don't gel with, on both enjoyment and proficiency levels.

Have only played with the auction rules. The move then score method seems to be almost a balancing mechanic, so capping towers is a good way to keep others from scoring equal points. Placement of camps is very important to getting your explorers out in such a way to be effective.

Note to self (12.7.2009) : It has been 3000+ days since I last played this. And I really liked the game (as far as I can remember..). 

The game is good but there is potential AP problem even with the basic rules. I would not dare to play with auction variant with certain groups since that would take sooome time. I like this type of semi-puzzle like action point system where you can maneuver in many ways.

Meaty game which utilises action points - all par for the course in Kiesling and Kramer's Masks Trilogy. Action point costs are nicely balanced and the game flows well. This one is about exploring ancient sites as opposed to building them (as in Mexica and Java). Brings out the thinker in me, much to the frustration of my opponents. (7.5)

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Baroque game that fits its topic like a glove - the atmosphere is achieved in an excellent way. Since it's more about strategy than tactics and there's lots of things going on, there can be some analysis paralysis, though - for two players the game turns out to be already rather epic, but for four there's just ages between each player's goes, turning all to be quite exhausting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Sconsigliato. Un gioco che mostra tutta la sua età.
Ogni giocatore ha 10 'mosse' a disposizione, da suddividere come ritiene opportuno, quindi si passa al giocatore successivo.
Questo meccanismo, comune in altri giochi, rende il gioco ricco di tempi morti. La grande interazione tra i giocatori impone tra l'altro di decidere la propria strategia solo all'ultimo; ne risulta che si rimane fermi gran parte del gioco per poi cominciare i propri ragionamenti di calcolo.

In sintesi l'ho trovato poco divertente.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Justifiably a classic, and somehow nothing has since been designed which plays quite like Tikal. The theme seems silly at first, but somehow works with the mechanics, and the much-heralded Action Point system is still fresh and doesn't take as much time to execute as one might imagine.

The auction variant is more of a mildly-interesting variant than an advanced game. I see nothing wrong with sticking to the basic version.

RATING: 7
A mainstream Euro: more of an intellectual exercise rather than being a game played for fun; theme is rather thin, though the superb art and components help give the theme more weight than it would otherwise have; competition is for scoring the most points rather than for eliminating competitors; rules not terribly difficult to grasp, but a fair amount of strategy and decisions to be made throughout. The scoring track goes around the border of the game board. I like the game for what it is. I would not turn down a game, but mainly, I'd have to be in the mood for this kind of Euro game to want to play at a particular time. That is, it's rather dry. Like many others, I rated it somewhat above "Mexica"--in my case, a half notch. It'sa  very good design, but I'm more interested in civilization-themed games about Mesoamerica. Traded in spring of 2008.

The game is a paradox.  I don't like the variable downtime and I don't love the huge amount of chance in something which takes so long each turn, but it still is fun to try and create your own private scoring nook.  I usually don't care much about looks, but this is one of the few games where the cool design probably helps me enjoy it more.  I think this is my favorite box cover and the treasures are fun to study.  

I haven't tried the auction variant.  It would definitely help a lot with the random draw issue, but make this mostly fun game even longer, which I don't want.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very pretty game with lots of opportunity for players to think and interact.  The tile auction variant is much, much better than the base game, as it reduces the luck-factor somewhat.  Can also be a bit of a brain burner, trapping people in analysis paralysis if they're not careful.  It's more fun when the deep thought is capped so that downtime is reduced.

RATING: 8
It’s not just about min/maxing your action points to probable victory points, but deciding where to set up so as to take points from the correct person. Or at least make it costly for them to score. If you spread yourself too thin, everyone’s going to pile into your temples. Therefore consolidate workers on a few big temples to discourage theft. Then try and steal some lower ranked temples which aren’t as guarded. There are good decisions every turn, combining strategic setup and tactics. It doesn’t rate higher due to downtime and the ease with which a player can be taken out of the game through accidental collusion, though usually induced by poor setup / defense admittedly. Still, there's plenty of meat to keep the grey cells turning.

Players need to keep the pace of the game in mind because a player pondering every possibility can ruin the game for everyone.  But when players avoid this, it is a great game and quite a pleasure to see the ruins expanding.  The fight over temples can get quite nasty.  Players can get a bit lucky collecting treasures in that a triple early can be quite powerful.  But I think the game offers enough room for creative play that skill will almost always trump luck.

I really wanted a exploration game where I really felt like I was exploring, and in that respect, this game fell flat. Instead of "exploring a tile" and see what was there, you drew a tile and placed it where you wanted, which felt more like world building (think Carcassonne) than exploring.
That being said, I liked the rest of the mechanics and how you were discovering treasures and temples. Keeping track of 10 action points every turn was sometimes hard if you lost track, but it wasn't that big of a deal. I loved the theme and would gladly play it again.

A sweet [i]looking[/i] game. First play was with three players, second with two.  In both games we used a reduced-tile variant.  I would only use the full set with four players.

Now more plays and my enthusiasm has faded. This is not nearly as cool as Maharaja, nor Australia, both of which give the Kramer and Kiesling experience in a more cohesive game.

This is a beautiful game, but the gameplay is pretty dry.  While learning the rules is fairly easy, winning strategies are relatively opaque.  I think it boils down to convincing people to stay away from your areas of the board.

RATING: 6
Love this game - best of the 3 in series (Tikal, Java, Mexica). Lots of interesting strategic and tactical choices to be made - rewards moves that "project power" into a space, without actually moving there. Random element is refreshing, and serves to limit the best player from devouring the others. Most fun had playing this game in a long time (since Settlers was brand new for us).

12/20 Tough to get this to the table, others have not enjoyed this as much as me.

Oct 2014: I played a number of games of this on iOS, and the AI is zero trouble. Against good human opponents, the game can get VERY nasty - and seems to devolve immediately down to a key pyramid that can be upgrade to a 8-10 and "sat-upon" by as few workers as possible for the rest of the game (though the 5-point action where you can cap them). I am concerned that I may have explored the essential game space here, and that the game may be mostly about player-induced randomness, and falling victim or not to being hosed by someone because of where you fall in the turn order. I am lowering my rating of the game, but I do recommend others try this if you have the game-time available, and have a smallish collection. There are a LOT of other good titles out today (2014) that are quite fun, less prone to AP (this one is notorious for it due to it's action-point design). Give Agricola a try for example, I think there is more fun to be had there.

Great graphic design, solid game, but I think after 30+ plays (including my iOS excursions) this one is done.

A fun strategy game about managing possibilities, balancing power, and building a shared board. Needs to be played with four people, or two if playing Mini-Tikal. The game is gorgeous as players place tiles onto the board and develop a unique landscape every time.

Fights over temple control can be exceptionally tense and very interesting decisions can be made about sacrificing your workers to secure a contested site. It's an eye-opener to see just how many different decisions you can make, and it's mentally stimulating to see how you can make the best of the board you have at the beginning of each turn.

The auction variant is a must if you dislike random chance impacting gameplay, and Mini-Tikal is excellent for those with less time or who desire a more intensely and directly competitive experience.

Some randomness still impacts gameplay with treasure draws, and it is possible for one player to entrench/turtle themselves into an unassailable position if left alone during a couple critical turns. 

Not recommended for players who suffer from analysis paralysis, you have a lot of options each turn. I view this a both a strength and a weakness.

Downtime can also be an issue because there's nothing at all you can do during another player's turn since the entire board can change before it's your turn again. The auction variant mitigates the downtime somewhat with the auction mechanic that allows you to stay engaged, but once you've won an auction you just have to sit back and watch the board change dramatically each turn.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
TRY Mar/05 (solo): played 3-er without auctions: seems very thematic, but also with very few truly useful choices.  Feels like it could benefit from a 3rd way to score points, as that would give more pull to spreading out the actions or coming up with a strategy.  Otherwise, it feels like one person could spend their action points to do all the work uncovering several temple levels only to lose the temple to another player who is using action points to add/move players.  Needs more tries, with actual opponents.  Does feel like it'd be simple enough for 7-8 year olds, which is a plus.

It's a fine game and a clean design, but somehow it doesn't appeal to me all that much. I enjoy playing it and it seems to have a good amount of replayability, but it also has a rather dry, mechanical feel to it despite the lush artwork. Overrated on the geek in my opinion. Prefer Kramer's less tidy Hacienda.

Though, Tikal is a very good step-up game for older kids. My oldest daughter played Tikal when she was 8 and really liked it.

And yes, the rumours are true - there is a lot of AP tendesies in Tikal. Even from players who usually don't hesitates to place their bits on the board.

An interesting area control game that suffers from unintentional kingmaking. If someone remains unopposed for temple scoring they will win the game. Unfortunately this game requires that you attack the leader after the first scoring round or the outcome will be decided for you. The problem with that is if only one player does this they usually cede the game to the person in second place. I see no way of correcting this problem with the way the scoring round system is designed. Regardless, AP prone gamers absolutely destroy any desire you have to play this game again, which is a shame because the game can be enjoyabe otherwise.

Pros:
* Gorgeous production value.
* Easy to learn, easy to teach.
* Player aid is surprisingly useful.
* Well designed box insert.

Cons:
* -2 for AP-prone gamers grinding this to a halt and sucking all the fun out of the game.
* How the scoring round works could have been clearer.
* Box cardboard could have been thicker.
* Unintentional kingmaking.

I own the IOS version of it. It was a steal since it was on sale for $1. The first game with the easiest AI has shown me that this is a very good game. It is an Euro with good amount of strategy, somewhat of a cool theme, and with minimized luck on the draw for tiles. It gives plenty of meaningful choices and did not have a clear runaway leader problem until the third scoring round. I also like the treasure digging aspect of the game which provides an alternating path to victory (although more of a tactic than strategy since you can't win a game soley on digging). I can see this game being bugged down by AP players so I will happily play this game on the Ipad.

Nice game, but definitely not for us. The amount of options and the calculations make the game more complex than what I am looking for on similar games. The luck aspect usually helps or hinders with not much regard of who played what. The game took three hours to play, and we did not play the bidding option, which I assume, extends the play time but reduces the luck factor. This is a great game, just not the experience I am looking for on games of this type, and with just one player not thinking/acting quick, it can become a drag quite easily.

Tikal is a great game, and provides an interesting environment of exploration mixed with area of control.  The action point mechanism is a new one for me as well.  I like to play this one a lot, but it's best played with your more anlytical friends.  The APs can cause a bit of delay while players decide what to do, but it's negligable - unless you have one of those players who insists on analyzing everything before finishes he his move. Because of this, I believe that the new themes, mechanisms and challenges make it best for your 'game-inclined' friends, and not the best one for beer 'n pretzels.

Update: It's OK - kind of a snoozer.  I don't care much for the AP - action points or analysis paralysis.

One of the best lighter games. I think the action point system works really well here. However, in my opinion, the game is won or lost depending on where you build your second camp, which can make the end anticlimactic. It’s a good game to play when you’re not in the mood for Aleas.

I recently played and enjoyed. The group I played with, though, suffered some AP players, and there was some tedious, Power Grid-style "watching other people do math" moments.

RATING: 5
I'm a sucker for exploration games and this one is beautiful to look at and mechanically strongly themed. But my major issue with the design is using a 10 action pt menu for the gameplay which makes it too susceptible to analysis paralysis. Not only is there the assessing of tile placement at the start of your turn but there are too many number-crunching avenues to best maximise your turn; Lost Valley & Africa provide more fun and pace whilst scratching my jungle bashing itch.

An engaging brain burner in the family of Mexica, Java, and Torres.  Tikal is a little less heavy than Java and a little less prone to analysis/paralysis, but still gets a bad rap for A/P. It shares many elements with the other games in the family: it uses the action point system and tile laying similar to Java and to a lesser degree Mexica. A great tactical area-control game.

I really enjoy the explorer theme. This is a nice area control mechanic game that gives room for multiple players to score for the same regions. The way it works, is when you enter a scoring round, each player essentially takes 1 free turn and then scores, so each player has a chance to move their units around.

It's a really interesting mechanic I wish I saw more often. You can also build your areas of the board higher making them worth more, and hopefully causing them to be more contested if the other players are paying attention.

Good game with very nice and big components, pretty artwork on tiles and treasure pieces. Theme is well done and has good presence in the game.

Reminds me of Tuluva but much heavier.  The thinking can really cause analysis paralasis for some, and moderatly long turns for most.  If you don't get the game yet, your turns might be short.  Once you do get it, they get really long, and slowly shorten up as you become aclimated to the game (which will likely take more than one game).  In the end, it is an enjoyable experience, if a bit of a brain burner.

I rated this much lower than Java, and I would say even Mexica. The analysis paralysis in a 4 player game was worse than the other two. So much so that it sucked the fun right out of it. It felt like an exercise in math, dry and boring, not what a game should feel like.

Although this game is the poster child for analysis paralysis, we address that by allowing (and encouraging) unsolicited advice from the non moving players (to both help the moving player and to help the advisor). Excellent components (this is what every manufacturer should strive for). Mechanics are nice and I'm a sucker for dynamic boards.

A large box game in every sense of the term. Tikal is a resource management game (the 10 action points used every turn are the resources) set in the jungles of Tikal.

The theme and mechanics integrate quite well and visually, the game is very appealing - the forest getting cleared with every turn, the growing size of the temples as more of it is uncovered, the different explorer teams having their own base camps etc.

The game box is also very well designed and the insert has a specific place for every component. The only downside is that the game can be a pain if a player has AP and ruminates endlessly over the most optimal play possible. The base version in which the tiles are not auctioned runs normally to about 90 minutes but the tile auction version, while reducing luck, tends to add a good 45-60 mins to the regular game duration.

Enjoyed it with and without the auction option. The auction adds a lot more strategy. However, I would recommend a few plays without the auction so you can get a feel of what to bid.

Good game that can be played with two or more players. Outstanding material. Easy to learn rules and mechanic. The theme is relevant. Still, it's missing that little somthing to be a great game. Would recommand to player one level above beginner.

Bon jeux qui peut être joué à deux joueurs ou plus. Matériel impécable, règles claires et mécanismes fluides, le thème est présent. Toutefois, ce jeux manque d'un petit je ne sait quoi pour en faire un jeu remarquable. Je recommande Tikal pour des joueurs d'un niveau légèrement supérieur à débutants .

Great theme and equally wonderful bits. I’ve found it a bit mean spirited though. Seems to result in a lot of bad feeling. "Why did you compete with me for this 8 temple and leave that 7 temple to them?" is common. The bidding for tiles reduces luck and increases decision making.

Beautiful game. Its hard to conceive of a better implementation of the area-control mechanic (although I've not played El Grande). Perhaps a bit more "downtime" than some of the other games in my collection, but I've always been engaged by other players' moves. Would always be happy to play this.

A couple plays in, both 2 player games.  Lovely game with a theme that actually helps in explaining the rules.  But optimization is so key here -- you spend quite a while looking for that one additional point somewhere -- that it becomes a little bit dry.  And after all that, my first game ended in a 108-108 tie.  I look forward to trying with 3 or 4 players.

I think I need to give this one another play even though I didn't enjoy it all that much.

I like the premise and the theme.  It is interesting and engaging and the theme matches the mechanics quite well.

Here's what I didn't like.  It was entirely possible to screw other players over just for fun.  It's not fun to me.  I'm fine with interaction, but conflict just for the sake of having conflict, annoys me.  But I know that after one play, it is hard to judge.  Perhaps it is a consequence of specific players involved.  

Tikal is not a game I enjoyed upon first play, but it is one that I would consider playing again at least once.

RATING: 2
Update: Four player games are much more interesting. Not sure if the artifacts are worthwhile.

I have only played two player, but believe it is broken for two.  There are three possible strategies in the game: Either build up temples, search for treasure, or a comination of both.  In a two player game, these choices are reduced mere randomness of the tiles/treasures drawn due to the zero-sum nature of the game (game theory).  For example: If player one chooses to search for treasure, automatically there is no incentive for player two to do the same as any single treasure drawn can be swapped by player one to make a better set.  In this case, player two will only be helping player one's vp total.  Therefore, player two will have to choose only to build temples and hope that player one will not draw good combinations of treasures until the end of the game.  At this point, the game has become rote and the players might as well play rock-paper-scissors (though r-p-s has more meta gaming and may be a better game than Tikal).

My rating reflects the two player "game".

However, I have not played a 3-4 player game of this and my opinions may change with that experience.

I can see why it's highly rated and won accolades, but the few games I played were just too dry and slow moving.  It's ironic that "action points" and "analysis paralysis" have the same acronym because the former mechanic in a game nearly always leads to the latter.

A classic game. Feels like something I might have played when I was younger. It looks more complicated than it really is. The mechanics would suggest a very cutthroat game but the way scoring is handled allows all players a chance at making the most of their turns. Even if the production value isn't as high, I think I might prefer this over Tikal II. 

UPDATE: The Super Meeple edition has crazy amazing components. Added back into my collection.

A great game if you enjoy a hard-thinking game that includes a certain amount of luck. There is an included variant (the "Auction game") that reduces the luck factor.

Can be a fun game, but if you have any analytical players, that like to think out all their moves in careful detail, be prepared for a hour and a half long game to become a three hour one.

Finally got this to the table, granted it was with my two boys, but it was still a fun game.  Down time can be a bit of a bummer and more so in a 4 player game.  That aside, I'm expecting this to go up in rating once I get my wife playing this.  Some luck is involved but all-in-all a rather rich and fun playing experience.  Once we get a few more plays under our belt I'm hoping we can try adding the auction element to the game play.

A fascinating game in theory.  I only played once but can see that the strategy is very subtle and worth exploring.  The bits are fantastic, even though the theme is not as strong as some people say it is (perhaps because we were playing the auction variant).  The only problem turns out to be a major problem--it's a very very slow game.  Unfortunately, it's not the kind of game that's fun unless you are really trying your best, and trying your best means spending a lot of time thinking.  Like playing scrabble, every additional minute of thought is bound to get you extra points, making it a painful game as you wait for everyone else to move.  Lots of points for originality and interest, minus a lot of points for taking WAAY too long.  

As an alternative, I might suggest Hansa, which has the same sort of logistical decisions to be made, but is much quicker (and lighter).

Very good game in the same vein as Settlers of Catan. Part of the gameplay is creating the map as you play. At the beginning of each turn you "explore" a new hexagonal portion of the board, which allows you to strategically build the map as well as play on it. Stacking some of the pieces as you unearth sky-scraping pyramids is cool, but can also get a little unwieldy.

Final scoring saves the game in that it's what you walk away thinking of instead of the drudgery leading up to it and the rest of the scoring rounds.  The auction rules might make the game a bit more strategic, but I don't think it's worth the time it adds to the game at all.

Fun game of exploration with nice bits.  The theme really fits the game well.  Others might mention a potential for analysis paralysis - but haven't really found that in my games.  Sure some folks play a bit slower trying to see what can be done, but I haven't found it to be a distraction.  Some thought is required but one can easily think during others moves so that turns can proceed rather quickly.  A game I enjoy playing for the competing treasure/temple strategies and how to maximize one's score will not yielding opportunities to others to score the same temples.

Beautiful and thematic game of jungle exploration.  Very open-ended and competitive.  I haven't played with tile bidding yet, but I want to -- I think it would lessen the impact of draw luck (something that bothers my group far more than it does me).  

Most importantly, I honestly feel like an explorer carving through the thick jungle when playing this game.  

Very tough decisions, trying to balance majority, scores, and treasures.  Don't undervalue the masks!

Kőkemény stratégiai játék. Annyira, hogy számomra már majdhogynem követhetetlen a feltárulkozó sok lehetőség. Nagyon nehéz optimalizálni az elkölthető 10 akciópont felhasználását.
Briliáns a tematika és a mechanizmus találkozása. Külön tetszik ezen túlmenően a Ravensburger által gyártott doboz, a precíz rendszerezőtálcával.
Igazi "ülünk a tábla körül, és mindenki agyal néma csendben" darab :) Akkor van baj, ha túlságosan hosszan gondolkodó partnerekkel hoz össze a sors egy Tikal játszmára.
---
Új tapasztalatok! :D
A játék 4 fővel szinte ideális. Talán kevésbé agyégető (úgy szoktunk játszani, hogy inkább gyorsabban hozzuk meg a döntést, mintsem az összes ember unatkozzon addig, amíg a soron levő optimalizál...) Rendkívül kiegyensúlyozott, ahol nem szabad hibázni, mert bizony szinte leküzdhetetlen lesz a hátrány.

RATING: 7
A lot of fun to play, I only have a few minor issues with this game.
1. )The standard game suffers a bit from the chance introduced by random tile draws. Two rounds of bad (or good) draws can completely tip the game in one player's favor.
2.) The auction variant eliminates some of the chance but it also tips the game in favor of the lead player (especially late in the game). Bidding is done with victory points, so players with even a modest lead have a heavy advantage in tile auctions.

RATING: 8
Over the past year, so many people whose opinion that I respect have begun to rave about the game again that I decided that I needed to give it another chance - but using the auctions.  We did, and I'm sold.  
Let's just say that I have seen that this game has much more depth and replayablity than I was giving it credit for.  I think that there were 2 factors that have convinced me to put Tikal back into my playing rotation.  
1)  The auction really does add some interesting elements.  Drawing and placing a tile doesn't allow for much long term planning and really has the effect of minimizing strategic decisions, so without the auction the game becomes more tactical and more luck driven.
2)  I don't believe that I had ever played the game with people that I would consider "serious" gamers.  This definitely had an effect on the "feel" of the game.  When played seriously, you have to be constantly on the lookout for ways to maximize your points, while trying to minimize the help that you give to your opponents.  With the wrong people Tikal could definitely fall into analysis paralysis, but the 3 of us kept things moving along fairly well (I think that I probably held things up the most, and I think that was mostly because I was learning the auction part of the game...)

I haven't played many (any?) exploration games so I don't have much in the way of comparisons, but entirely on its own merits Tikal is very good. It's about striking a good balance between scoring points for yourself and thwarting other players. The board, though not complex, is easy on the eye and the gameplay is handled through a logical 'action points' system. Good stuff all round. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Doesn't work well for non-gamers, though the theme is appealing enough. Maybe too many tough decisions. But with the right people (analysis paralysis may occur sometimes), Tikal is a great way to spend 1,5 hours.

:thumbsup: Very good usage of the action point mechanism. Almost every turn you're thinking: [i]"Damn, if only I'd haved one more action point to pull off everything I want to do..."[/i]
:thumbsup: It has a fun learning curve, with great replayability. Every time I play, I feel I've 'upped my game'. Meanwhile, the game itself keeps balance between experienced and new players with an element of controlled randomness due to the tile draws: you have a rough idea of when a type of tile can come up, but you never know exactly when it will be drawn (e.g. volcano tiles that start a scoring round, or the fact that temples closer to the bottom of the stack have higher point values while treasure spots contain more treasure tokens at the top of the deck than at the bottom).
:thumbsup: The Ravensburger edition has a delightfully rustic appearance. I recommend you put on one of the many [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IAfg_Iy7n8]rainforest YouTube-videos[/url] on in the background, to increase your immersion.

RATING: 9
Great components (though it really needs some glass beads or something to use for action points), and a good meaty game to go with them. It seems a bit multiplayer solitaire with just two people, and even with three people one player can get away with having their own little fiefdom. I suspect that four players might be the best number for Tikal, though you'd need to pick them carefully to avoid AP. And it's best with the auction variant (it can be a bit of a luckfest otherwise) IF you have quick thinking players.

Feels a little preprogrammed to me compared with other Kramer games. The best move is often obvious, because movement costs reduce your possibilites down to a couple of options. It's a solid game, but I prefer Maharaja to scratch the same itch. I'd recommend Tikal for people who are looking to move on from gateway games into something slightly meatier. It's about the same weight as Power Grid.

Update: bumped to an 8 after a few more plays. Very enjoyable.

Update: still great, still want to play more. A better design than Maharaja, in retrospect. Promoted to 9.

The father of the "action point" system.  Players get 10 points to spend each turn doing various actions, each with their own cost.  The goal is to accumulate points by exploring a jungle, collecting/stealing matching treasures, and uncovering temples.  There are multiple ways to get points and focusing on a few is better than trying to get them all.  Given there are only a few scoring rounds, which are semi-random, and the quick, easiness of play, this makes a great gateway game.  Also a fantastic game for 2 players.

In my view, Tikal is everything I look for in a game: simple rules, but lots of options and difficult decisions; always wanting to do more than you can; perfect scalability; a unique theme; and drop-dead gorgeous components.  There's the potential analysis paralysis thing, but it's all within your control.  If you find it's a problem, it means you're not playing fast enough - just play and don't care too much about winning or losing.  If you take that attitude, it won't be a problem.

Using volcanoes for roadblocks to their progress adds to the fun. Hot stuff!!

Pretty good game about exploring ancient ruins. There's so much to do, and precious few action points to work with. You can wind up making some interesting plays, but it's also a bit of a brain burner trying to maximize your treasures and temples in preparation for the four cumulative scoring rounds which can happen at any time. I like the exploration aspect. I've only played the basic game, sans auctions. UPDATE: Increasing rating to 7.5 The game plays much better with people who can make faster decisions and plan their moves while other people are taking turns. Otherwise it goes on for longer than it should after it is obvious who is going win. The game has a somewhat severe early mistake penalty, whereby if you fail to score well on the first volcano there's a good chance you'll remain behind the rest of the game. It's not impossible to come back though. I find a good strategy is to stake out your own area of the board and build it up, trying to get the other players to nip at each other's heels instead of yours.

Tends to be regarded as a fairly dry game, with a bit of annoying luck.  I like the random aspect, though, and there's plenty of options to pursue and some good old "hide your real intentions" meta-gaming going on, which I also like.  Better than Java, not quite as good as Mexica.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
In Tikal the decision space starts out narrow and widens as you add more workers and tiles to explore until it reaches its zenith in the end game. Java's decision space starts out as wide or wider than Tikal's final state and remains pretty much constant throughout due to its vertical placement options. And, finally, Mexica's decision space starts out wide open and slowly narrows as more and more of the board becomes sectioned off by canals and locked down into districts. Looking at the series in this way, you can begin to see why people may suggest that Java would be the most AP prone of the lot: in Tikal, AP potential appears to rise as the number of options available rises due to increases in the number of workers and cleared jungle tiles; in Java, it starts high and remains fairly constant from beginning to end; and, in Mexica, it seems to slowly decrease, but never disappear, as the game wears on.

What a great game.  Fairly simple rules, and easy to remember all of them - but it opens up a LOT of strategy.  Some people complain about "analysis paralysis" - we play with a timer - if your turn isn't finished before the timer runs out, your turn is over anyway.

Tikal -- I finally played the auction version, and I don't plan to go back.  This game is truly scalable.  Yes, the gameplay with two players is different from, say, four.  But unlike other games, the game retains it's "feel" regardless of the number of players.  Furthermore, it's [b]good[/b] with 2, 3, or 4 players.

I feared that if Torres was too much analysis, then Tikal would be worse, since a) that's what they say, and b) it has twice as many action points, and twice as many actions. To my pleasant surprise, it is not the case, since the higher randomness of the tiles , treasures, and number of possible good plays makes it unlikely that there is only one optimal play, so we just do what seems best. All around, Tikal has a great theme, great graphics and components, and great gameplay.

Somewhat of a runaway winner problem... I just learned, after dozens of plays, that I was playing a few mechanics incorrectly (which made the game easier).

An action point game of exploration and area control. The variable set-up and map that reveals itself as you go makes this game feel very different from other area control games like El Grande where the variability comes in the form of many action cards (which can be intimidating to new players). The streamlined rules that result from this make the game immediately accessible.

[18 plays] Beautiful game components and a really fun game. The first game I ever played with the action point mechanic. I don't find the analysis-paralysis criticism any more valid with this game than could be said about dozens of others - depends on your friends. I traveled throughout the Yucatan in 1997, and this game brings back great memories of those travels.

I will not play this with analysis-paralysis types!!!! That said, I especially enjoy Tikal as a two player game (less downtime, more feeling of head-to-head competition). It plays in about an hour, and provides for a pretty intense experience. I like how Tikal manages to blend tactics with strategy. Over the course of a game, you have a rough idea of when scoring is going to occur (basic version), and so are able to plan ahead to some degree. You also have the option to build up to two additional base camps, which increase your mobility in different regions of the board. Tile placement is also rather strategic, and allows you to shape the board throughout the game to your advantage, or your opponents' detriment. The use of action points forces you to make more tactical decisions, and the scoring rounds themselves are an exercise in analytical tactics. "Analytical" - that's a word that is very appropriate to this game. Every turn, you must analyze which use of your available action points (10 each turn) give you the most reward - both for the next scoring round, and for the game overall. So the game requires analysis, and it doesn't really evoke the passions as a result. I don't get excited about Tikal the way I do about some other games, but I'm up for a game most of the time. Enjoyable.

Update: I am frankly surprised that I like this game as much as I do. I wouldn't classify it as an especially rich game, and I don't spend any time thinking about how I would play differently once a game is over. Neither do I anticipate playing it with the thrill accompanying, say, Union Pacific or Struggle of Empires. But I'm usually willing to play it, and enjoy doing so. Perhaps it is a kind of intellectual exercise that simply scratches an itch? More players makes the game more interesting to me, and increases the role of strategy versus tactics (which I like!), but the downtime is nearly *unbearable*. And with more players in the game, your positional options are further limited, giving you less thinking to do during all that tedious waiting. With two players, the game isn't quite as interesting, but it plays much, much faster. Tikal is very hard for me to rate objectively in terms of its excellence as a game, but it's easy for me to determine that it's something I definitely need to be "in the mood" to play.

Final update (& verdict): I really have a love-hate relationship with Tikal. Sometimes, major arm twisting is required for me to play, because it simply feels like a very tedious logical exercise of navigating a too-dense decision tree. But there isn't any *fun* in Tikal's brain-burniness. I give it a 4. Other times, it does kind of "scratch the itch" - but even then, it isn't loads of fun. It simply satisfies the part of me that enjoys this kind of intellectual exercise. I give it a 6. In the end, I'm splitting the difference. Tikal is a 5 for me.

Absolute final update (seriously!): Tikal, like El Grande, suffers (from my perspective) in that it fails to reward excellent play in the late game. Contrast with Tigris and Euphrates where a mistake on player A's part provides an opening for player B to catch up and win, or with Puerto Rico where you can trail for most of the game, but where your wharf-buying strategy can pay off in the late game. In Tikal, unfortunately, brilliant plays in the late game will avail you very little. So long as the leader plays "competently", her early lead will give her the game. Tikal probably has a greater probability (than, say El Grande) of allowing the trailers to take a leader down - but not by much. This bleeds a lot of the tension out of the game, and for me anyway, diminishes the fun.

A profi verzió még a minimális szerencse szerepet is kiiktatja a játékból. Jól kitalált a játékmenet és előnye még, hogy páratlan játékosszámmal is jól működik.

Wow, I'm a retard.  When I first played this it was with a very slow player.  At the time this came out I was a newbie to the whole Euro thing, and felt a little overwhelmed by the min/maxing, irritated at the downtime and reflexively felt guilty if my turns took too long.  At the same time it had a random element that clearly benefited those that drew better tiles, so all the hard work I would put in it seemed secondary to drawing treasure tiles or big temples.  I was frustrated by the system and table courtesy. What I was looking for was a heavier Euro game with a smoother transition between players, less downtime, while being less luck dependent.  In time I found those games.

Now, revisiting it, I see that it still has the same "problems". Now, though, I've found players that won't take forever with this, and I've learned to play this kind of game fairly quick, so the luck of a draw remains the last primary nuisance.  I have yet to play this with the auction variant, which should solve my issue.  

That said, even playing the base game as is, I like it now.  In fact, I really like it.  It is quite a turn around of opinion.  This still means that the game has the potential to go south with the wrong people, but the same can certainly be said of the other games in this series, and in fact with most games in general.  

Still, despite the bump on the charts it is my least favorite of the Mask Series.  That may change with the auctions, but I doubt it.

Tikal is meatier and less luck-driven than Carcassonne or Settlers, but still simple enough to serve as a gateway game. My only complaint is the slightly inelegant action point system--you get ten every turn and you'll want to consider carefully how best to spend them. I can't help thinking that this could have been streamlined a bit to make the choices clearer for new players.

Tikal is a beautiful game and it is also quite thematic, which gives it a big thumb in my book.  Fortunately, the fine folk that introduced me to it were not big into analysis paralysis, because this must be the game that spawned the concept.

A good, thinky, action-point allowance game, with some interesting strategic choices and opportunities to surprise your opponents with some clever moves. Also very pretty.

A good game with an even better implemented theme. It really feels like you're exploring the jungle and the three dimensional temples are very cool! It plays really good, as well. It's one of the heavier and longer games in my collection and a good choice when I have some hours to spare. Just one slightly annoying remark: Who came up with the red and orange player coulors? Why not four well distinct colours?

RATING: 6.8
This rating is currently based on my only play, where we had a game in which I managed to draw treasure tile after treasure tile, which gave me tons of points and a relatively easy win.  It seems like the game has a bit too much luck and is unbalanced, but I'd like to play again to see for sure.

UPDATE:  Much better the second time.  I can see how people can complain a bit about AP, but that's the only thing I can say negatively about it.  I think the luck balances out.

UPDATE #2: Having played it again, it's not a bad area control, action point game, although I wouldn't say it's a classic.

RATING: 7
A great game of exploration. Looks beautiful, too!

Players have 10 action points. Each turn, you first take the top hex tile (arranged in groups A, B, ... G; random order within groups) and place it on the board connected to what's already there (board starts with 3 hexes already revealed). Connections are by stone markers on the hex-sides which form paths -- there must be a path connecting every new tile to a previously placed area. Tiles show a variety of things (temples of various levels; collections of 3-4 treasures; empty space; volcanos --> scoring round). Then, you spend your 10 AP to do various things (bring workers into play, move workers around, unearth more temple levels, take treasure from board, trade treasure with other player, etc.). If the volcano was drawn, it's not played immediately; instead, you take your normal turn, then score (score for temples you control [= more workers than anyone else], 1pt/temple level; and for your jewelry collection. Everyone else does the same. THEN, you resume the game: place the volcano and take your turn. There are 3 volcano/scoring rounds during the game: 1 each in the B, D, and F hex groups. At the end of the game, there's another scoring round. Most points wins!

The advanced variant is better: instead of just drawing from the top of the hex pile, at the start of each round you reveal as many tiles as there are players. Then, players auction the right to choose which tile to take, and take their turn. Repeat each round. This version takes away the luck of the tile draw, but does take a bit longer to play.

An Action Point game with almost TOO many choices to be enjoyable.  I've only played a couple of times but I got the feeling that if you're always first or second during scoring, you're in trouble.  It seems to upset the balance of the game.

It could be a nice game, but the scoring system doesn't work for me at all. It just doesn't make any sense. 

Playing all the time to get some area majority in some places and then everything is decided by the player that gets the scoring tile in the first place!!! In the end, too much ado about nothing.

Tikal is an achievement in board gaming. The freedom of the action point system in combination with strategic planning for the endgame/scoring rounds and tactical decision making each turn is brilliant. Generally, luck does not play a huge factor in the game since you really have control over the majority of your turn. There is an amazing sense of progression as the tiles are placed each turn, and every move a player makes impacts the future game. The really cool theme of exploring temples in the jungles of Mexico may be a hard sell for some folks, but in my opinion it just makes sense. The criticisms that this game is "AP inducing" are largely unfounded; I would suggest that this game was intended to be played multiple times, as are most strategy games, thereby reducing play time with experience.

One of my favorites. A plus, everyone I've taught this to enjoyed it. (Including parents,wife and other gamers.) With the folks I've played with, we rarely have a problem with downtime.

Looking forward to trying the auction varient, as many have said it improves the game.

Fun. Well-produced too. A bit too slow-going for my liking though. And if you get lucky with the tiles a few times (or, when bidding for the choice of tiles, you're position gives you a bit of an advantage in significant rounds), it's quite possible to really stride ahead. For a no-dice strategic game, maybe a little too much so. Decent enough action point system, simple rules for fairly deep play.

Finally, a game that will allow me to use 10 action points per turn instead of only a couple of simple actions!  And what a beautifully illustrated game it is!  But most importantly, it is fun to play and does a good job of instilling that feeling of anticipation that comes with exploration.  I only have a few minor complaints with this game.  The first is that it can be difficult to catch up if you start to fall behind in points, and it's nearly impossible to make up the lost ground if a player is down more than a handful of points after the second scoring round (especially in a two-player game).  Secondly, with the only two scoring possibilities coming from owning treasures or uncovering temples, it sometimes feels like the options are either very limited or fairly obvious.  It would be nice to have a couple more ways to gain points (or how about some dangers lurking in the jungle, waiting to catch an unsuspecting explorer?).  To make things slightly more interesting, I give the treasures different values: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/file/info/32356.  Thirdly, it's a bit of a nasty game, with players constantly trying to steal each others' highest-scoring temples and treasures.  But that being said, it's still a very enjoyable and competitive game of exploration.  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 3/5  Total: 7/10

An excellent game for appearance, quality, and playability.  The box itself has one of the best component storage systems I have seen.  Watch out for one player getting to many artefacts but once this has happened once players will prevent it a second time.  This game makes it's way to the table again and again.

I was disappointed in this game after reading such positive reviews.  I found that turns (particularly in scoring rounds) became optimization exercises that were subject to analysis paralysis.  There is nothing to do when it's not your turn, so there can be significant downtime.  I didn't see this hitting the table with my friends, and it wasn't that interesting as a 2-player game, so I sold it.  But it shore is purdy!  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
After several plays of this game it has grown on me.  Although it doesn't have as much player interaction as I would like, I really like the theme, modular board, and the many tactical decisions to be made.  Collectively these make up for the low player interaction.  I particularly like that you can build two camps that serve as remote entry points for your explorers, which makes for some interesting options as the game unfolds.  The only downside to the game is the potential for analysis paralysis, which can create more downtime between turns.  Putting a time limit on turns may be one way to solve this, but AP becomes less of a problem with experienced players.

Very sketchy rating based on one play where I felt kinda sick and also got my head handed to me by all three other players.  I thought it was filled with tough, interesting choices.  And it looks great.  My big complaint might be how long it takes for other people to take their turns, though this wasn't really a problem in my game.  I am not big on the idea of it taking forever to get back to my turn.  I like to be more engaged, though I am willing to make exceptions for really stellar gameplay.  This one is almost to that level, but it might not quite be.  Also, the ability to just hose one person seemed high in this one.  I was destroyed by red at the beginning, and my best plays had me just picking on orange for the rest of the game.  We finished 3rd and 4th, and the game felt out of my hands.  That may have been an isolated incident, and I would definitely play again.  Rating might go up on further plays, but it almost certainly won't go down.  On the other hand, I probably won't buy it unless my gaming budget goes up significantly.

Played again:  nevermind.  I just don't think this game is all that good.  Too long (AP problems), and filled with choices that force you to really screw one player.  This game is all about sticking it in the player next to you, and unlike, say, El Grande's constantly changing game-state, if you get screwed in Tikal at about halfway, you are totally tooled in a 4-player game (and somewhat in a 3-player).  The Action point system kind of sucks, like a replacement for real game mechanics.  I dunno.  Others seem to really like it, so maybe it's a good one, but it's probably not for me.  4 seems kinda harsh, but "doesn't get me but could get talked into it" sounds about right.

beautiful board & thoroughly evokes its theme (as do all kramer games).  its main weaknesses are: (1) cumulative scoring rounds, which over-privilege someone who does really well in early rounds; and (2) that you can often hit stretches of not having anything to do.  still, a very enjoyable & accessible game.

[4 plays] Decent game.  I have enjoyed it everytime I played it.  I do like games that are very calculating.   I have played the auction style each time I played it.  The one thing holding back this game from being one of my top favorites is that it does seem even for me who enjoys dry calculating game almost too much.  One person has a turn and spends some amount of time calculating and optimizing their 10 actions, the rest sit and watch.  Then the next player does the same thing, etc.  This game is all about optimizing your 10 actions to set yourself up for the scoring rounds.  Fun, yes definately.  Top favorite?  Not quite enough personality or excitement for me to consider it a top favorite.

Plus points
Great components; interesting Explorer theme; good use of action points
Bad points
Too long (use a timer). Needs auction version to compensate for the huge advantage in going first in scoring rounds. Instead of going around in clockwise order the Auction version should have extended the auction to all players in the scoring round as this makes a huge difference in the score. May be an 8+ with a timer and a tweak in the Auction rules.

I really liked this one.  The point system works well here mostly because, while it does give you lots of choices, there aren't so many choices that you are struggling to decide what to do.

I've tried a lot of Kramer/Kiesling games and one thing is consistent for me:  I just don't like them.  I don't know if they are just too dry for me or what, but I don't really care for them. They work fine as a design, but I'm just not interested in the gameplay.

That said, Tikal was tolerable enough.  I'd play it again, but I'm not eager to.  I've played much worse.

RATING: 7
Area control game with an exploration theme. The mechanism is driven by action points and each player has to allocate their points as each turn a new part of the board is added, thereby uncovering new parts of the temples and jungle. The action points allow you to perform different functions such as moving members of your expedition, uncovering extra layers of the temples, discovering treasures etc. In order to gain victory points you need to have overall control of different temples and collect sets of treasures. The scoring system is well balanced and serves to keep games tight. It's difficult to fault Tikal as an example of area control gameplay, in fact it achieves its aims very well, it's just that I always seem to find games like this slightly detached from their theme resulting in a somewhat abstract exercise.

A solid game, I could say: "extended and more heavy Carcassonne". Simple rules, but there is something to think about during the game. A little of analysis paralysis should be expected, also during the auction, if you are playing the professional variant. Clearly better with 4 than with 2. It is classical euro, the climate of jungle explorations (like Indiana Jones...) is weakly perceptible. 

Number of plays: 3.

Tikal is a beautiful looking game, based on a great premise, with sound mechanics, clear easy to learn rules and excellent player interaction.  However, after one playing (so I could be wrong), it seems that it becomes bogged down during the closing stages.  Movement, excavation, treasure hunting (all the main elements to the game) become more and more difficult to the point where some spaces become untouched.  This, of course, might have been just a symptom of the particular session we were playing, but it does seem that the game itself is designed to create this situation.  I just wonder why.  Perhaps experienced players become better at maximising the limited opportunities of the end game.  Only time will tell.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
So many tile-placing games are abstract. Tikal, on the other hand, really captures the flavor of hacking through a jungle seeking treasure. The basic game is fun and playable by non-gamers, while the advanced game offers a somewhat more challenging and strategic experience.

Great game! One of my favorite ever! Every action point need to be optimized and not wasted. I love this kind of game where optimization is one of the main mechanics.

'Usually willing to play' on the following agreement: you take your turn quickly and if you undo things during your turn, I get to beat you until bloody.

Before playing this, I was worried that the 10APs could lead to some serious analysis paralysis. It wasn't terrible, but it was certainly present. I like it, but I like the 'speed' of Torres more.

Update: This is a classic K&K design; everything just works wonderfully and I'm constantly impressed how often players are one AP short of what they want to do. Just a brilliant piece of design.

Rating up from 7 to 8.3.

I've played it on SBW, I'd like to play the tile auction rules as well sometime.  I like this game, it feels like I'm actually controlling an expedition into the rain forest looking for artifacts and dig sites.

There is a downtime issue in the RL game.  This disappears on the SBW.

The auction variant has been played by me now IRL Downtime in the game is still an issue, but the auction variant does make the game quite fun still.  I really like this game, just wish it didn't take so long to play.

Great game!
The action point system, the exploration by tile placement and the area control aspect work very well.
It's interesting that the scoring isn't done simultaneously for all players, each player gets a separate round before his scoring.
The Mayan temple discovery theme is superb and fits.
The only real negative I see is that the game takes a bit too long.

After almost 2.5 years of sitting on a shelf since the ONE time I was able to play it and I was finally able to play it again at the request of a member of one of the gaming groups I get together with.  It was as good as I figured it would be and I had a great time with it.  It helped that I won...  but still... a nice solid game.

Not good with 2 players. Too much empty space, virtually no conflict or interaction. 3-4 players is much better.

edit after more play: Lowered my grade. Too much luck involved. If you're last in every scoring round you're going to finish last. Plus, the end game is quite dead. All the excitement is gone halfway through.

Edit 2: this game still has a lot of great moments. Rating increased.

RATING: 8
Was fun and I enjoyed the theme, but the games I've played so far had a serious element of streakiness to it.  One player always seems to drawing treasure, one player draws temples, and one player keeps drawing empty fields.  I also wasn't fond of the fact that on the last turn, the player who goes first basically gets screwed since he has no way to retalliate, but this is partially made up for by the fact that he is likely to get in more turns in before scoring.  Overall, a decent game, and one that I'd play again.  More fun than Mexica.  The auction rules remove the luck element, but also slow down the game significantly.

1999 Spiel de Jahres winner.
This is one of those fun action point games, but it can really introduce AP in people. The online version (www.spielbyweb.com) is nice in that it will count out and display the most efficient movement costs. After lots of playing, games start to feel the same, but if its not part of the regular rotation, it is a great game. You have to play with the auction variant, or else it is too random and luck based.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This is my favorite game. I like how this game combines area control with tile placement. I also like the points mostly come from excavating and controlling temples, and treasures are usually secondary. The scoring is cool because you never know exactly when your position will be scored. As an archaeologist, I feel this game is more faithful to the profession than many other games. I like how Mayan numerals are on the excavation tiles. Excavation seems to be the main points scorer while the stereotypical treasure hunting is secondary. I would prefer treasure to be nonexistent in an archaeology game, but everyone thinks about Indiana Jones when it comes to archaeology.

Tikal is my favorite of the popular action point games by Kiesling and Kramer. The exploration element is thematic and fun. Trying to squeeze as much as possible out of each turn, especially as the endgame nears, is what makes this game so good.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
As a lot of others have mentioned, Tikal is a beautiful game.  The clearings seem to emerge from the dark jungle as you progress.  To me though, it's not quite as much fun as tier-one games.  It seems that players are for the most part staring at the board while the gears in their head spin out of control trying to maximize their score.  Personally, I don't mind it when the gears in my head spin out of control, so I would still play Tikal any time.  The auction version is much better than the "take the top tile" version, and I don't really see a reason not to use the auction.

The first action point allowance game I played. I find the jungle exploration theme enjoyable and the mechanics easy to grasp, although strategies took several plays to begin to learn and refine. One of the things I really appreciate about this game is that it is simple to learn and easily approachable, yet provides many layers of strategic depth. In addition, replayability is extremely high due to the tile-laying aspect.

The tile-auction variant is a nice touch, as it allows you to remove the element of luck in the form of the blind tile draw found in the base game. I've found player aids in the form of action point tracking sheets are a must and can be found in the "Files" section of the game home page. Free online play is available at www.SpielByWeb.com for those wanting a better feel for the game.

A nice little game with does a good job of capturing the "explore the jungle" theme.  Prone to a little bit of slowdown as people try to min-max their 10 action points, especially around the scoring.  This is one of those games that I am happy to pull out every couple of years and enjoy.

RATING: 9
This game is excellent. I love that you start off with this little army and over the game that army travels around and sets up strongholds. It's all the good parts of area control with out any of the bad parts (e.g. Risk-style battles that take forever and don't move the front). Straightforward to teach. Only have two very minor quibbles which are that the volcano scoring round is a bit confusing, and the "paths" on the tiles make it look like those are blockades and you're supposed to go around through the clearings, which is the exact opposite of what the designer meant. Not a big deal. The best part is how holding onto those high value pyramids as the scoring round gets closer is super stressful, strategic, and fun, and the way the scoring works means that two players can score for the same tile, which makes it less cut-throat, meaning this is one of the few area control games I can imagine playing light-heartedly with family. And even still, it doesn't lose that strategic edge. One of my top games, and my favorite area control.

I've played this on my iPad plenty. What keeps me from buying the printed edition is that I've heard how turns can take a long time playing live as people calculate how to use their 10 action points.

But the game has very interesting decisions, that's fur sure.

:UPDATE:

I finally picked this one up. I first grabbed the standard Rio Grande edition, but then after seeing pictures of the French edition (with the amazing stone pyramids), I paid the extra to order one from Canada. I can't wait to play it.

RATING: 7
Probably the best out-of-the-box gaming experience I've had with my family. Great components and aesthetics and an excellent action point system. The theme is not overshadowed by the abstract nature of the game. Some of the shine has worn off as I've played it more but still a very good game.

10 plays: really solid game. I'd like to give it a bonus point for components and packaging but I'll leave it at 7. The game's tempo falls off a bit at the end instead of building to a crescendo.

Also fell in love with this game playing on iOS, but now have a physical copy! :)

iOS version. Love the combination of area control, exploration (tile placement) and action point allowance.  Great thematic feel in my opinion.  Love the idea of an auction for tiles each round. Kind of wish the physical game was a little more overproduced (like with 3d temples).   Definitely hope to get a copy of this someday, might be a fun game to DIY a 3D copy.

One of my wife's favorites.

Heavy enough to really make you think, but you can get new players into it pretty easily.

Great game to introduce to new gamers who want more challenge and the beautiful components are always a plus.

I think this can almost be used as a gateway. Maybe a Heavy Gateway.


Update:  Rating stays the same.  I think the Heavy Gateway still apllies but it might be a bit too much for many.  I think that Puerto Rico still makes a better heavy gateway.  Not because it is necessarily lighter than Tikal, but because it feels lighter when first introduced.

That said, I have had success introducing this to non-gamers, but have had failures too.

I highly recommend the short version posted in the files section and I even more highly recommend the removalof certain tiles for 2 and 3 player games.  In order to find the tiles for removal you'll have to search through the forums and possibly cached files on the internet.  I don't precisely remember how I got the rules

Update: Played this again recently after a long layoff. The rating stays the same as I enjoyed my plays. I can see why games with lots of action points allowed per turn are not really designed anymore as it does create a much longer playtime, but one's turns can be very rewarding too. 



Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3


Overall - 1

One of my first four euros (along with [gameid=13], [gameid=539] and [gameid=93]. I've played dozens of unlogged games before I joined BGG.  Plenty of AP in this game (both Action Points and Analysis Paralysis).  We took to playing with a chess timer when the latter got too annoying.  I always play with the auction variant, which mitigates the luck of the draw but adds time to the game.

It's a nice-looking game with some interesting mechanisms. I like the action-point system quite a bit, but with 10 APs per person, it can drag. If it were about 30 minutes shorter, I'd like it a lot more.

Great stuff embedded in this game.  This game has just the right amount of choices to make it appealing to both seasoned gamers and those just starting out.  A great introduction to the action point allowance system.  One's strategy distinctly changes from early game to late game as well, thus justifying its fairly long play time.  The only concern worth mentioning is the Analysis Paralysis, which this game (potentially) has in spades.

I LOVE the way the board looks as areas get discovered. But so many action points per player can really slow this game down. It's one of the many games where I feel like if I spent like 30 minutes on my turn, I could always do the optimal thing, but I don't want to slow the game down, so I do kind of random stuff instead. And then there's that player who either is just a really fast thinker who wins because he can do math in his head really fast, or that player who doesn't mind making everyone wait while he spends taking 30 minutes for his turn.

Tikal was my surprise hit of Gen Con 2015. Yes, I know the game released in 1999, but I hadn't ever heard of it and it ended up being the best game I played at the Con.

Very engrossing.  Requires tactical thought to make most efficient use of action points each turn but also strategic, almost chess-like, evaluation of board as a whole and areas of strength and weakness.  Really all about area control - and not just the area of a single hex, but groups of hexes.  Analysis paralysis can allegedly be a problem for some but that depends on the players -- the games I've played have never seemed to drag.

Kramer & Kiesling do it again with this solid action point game.

A really good game. And also an amazing factory of AP. Spending 10 actions points in several available options in every player turn, if the person is trying to min-max every point of it, can turn a good game into and exercise of wasting everyone's time. Turns should be played with a timer - no one should take more than 2-3 minutes. But then some players would probably die - the game would go faster though, so it is a hard bargain.

Anyaway, I liked [thing=54][/thing] and this above is more foreshadowing, as my own play didn't drag. So it is just a friendly warning.

Another good game from the duo Kiesling & Kramer.

I tend to like games where players have to think about their moves and strategy (i.e., analysis paralysis). Tikal offers that with its 10 movement mechanism, and I also tend to enjoy tile laying games. I feel like I am an explorer hacking my way through the jungle to find the treasure.

Update: Java is superior.

Beautiful. Tile placement pleasing with the creation of both barriers & Action Point costs for routes so the photographs of the game in progress belies the complex incentive-paths builds. The worker maneuvers it creates with a relatively simple looking large hex arrangement is just right to make each turn rife with choices just the other side of calculable due to the randomness of the tile placement & the other's behavior in response to the cost-benefit riddle of treasures vs board development.  

Tikal has a fun undertow rather than a stressful one of churn, & while the 2-player lasts too long (it's worth experimenting with shortening by removing some tiles) I felt no real downtime or distress as it was interesting to watch each other player solve the riddles presented them as they accept & provoke new proffers. 

I do understand some reporting the game overstays & can cause AP like an abstract. This doesn't bother me at all, I like it when a positional situation causes some mulling over the board, & familiarity of the game seems the simple antidote.

Played 1st time with M. Look forward to Java soon & comparing.

One of the Birthday Trilogy, as I've just now decided to call it: three games I bought for my wife's birthday (tomorrow as I write this), all named after places we've visited.

After a few plays: Plays well at 2p and 4p; we taught it to a non-gamer, who got into it easily. At 2p, I feel it needs more workers...I feel like adding some cubes from another game. My wife argues that it's OK as is, you have to use limited resources, but I disagree. We'll see. Other than the 2p scaling issue (or not), it's a good game, maybe a little better than Mexica, which we like a lot.

Tikal is a game of exploration within the Central American jungles in search of lost temples and the treasures within. Players send their team of explorers into the jungle, exposing more and more of the terrain. Along the way, you find temples that require further uncovering and treasures. Players attempt to score points for occupying temples and holding onto treasure.

My fourth favorite game.

The only thing I don't like is ping-ponging 2 workers between two temples one step away and increasing both temples levels by two every turn.

Should be:
1) Any given temple can only be raised by 2 levels on a player's turn.
2) One worker is needed per leveling.
3) A worker leveling a temple cannot level another temple in the same turn, but may move before and after he levels.

We've played this a lot.  There is nothing bad about it except that it's a little long.  It does not drag.  It does not outstay its welcome, it is just a long game.  This is the perfect area control game for me.  El Grande can't compare.  I love the staggered scoring.  

Play the auction variant.  Also, try mini tikal for 2 players.  Very solid variant.  I only play 2 player with this variant.

*after 30 plays it is getting old and gone down to an 8.  maybe too much to look at.  I will not say no to this game with 4.

Nice game IF played quickly. Prone to over-analysis, which can really ruin the fun you get out of it. After playing this game 7 times, I also have the feeling that, when played with 4 players, if the player to your left draws the volcano tile more than once it really ruins your chances to win. So, although nice, I like the other Mask games (Java and Mexica) a little bit better. Calculations and luck of the draw do not gel too well in my opinion. It has got GREAT components though!

Played this game with two auction style. Loved it. Owned this game after Java and both games are action point mechanisms but with different styles of play. Certainly different enough to warrant getting Mexica as well. Highly rated and recommended and certainly worth the SDJ award. The only worry is that the tiles, if played often will become repetitive and can be predicted.

RATING: 2
Played the non-auction version. I was quite excited about this game, but it turned out to be quite disappointing. The random tile draw, with 2 of us drawing 2 or 3 hexes of treasures meant that those players could complete full sets fairly easily. 

It also meant that those without treasure sets seemed to languish very far behind, losing in the end by about 100 points. 

Drawing the volcano tile was also really bad as it ate up another one of your draws and I luckily drew it twice! 

I do want to try the auction variant, but it was such a disappointing first play that it's really unlikely that I'll give this another shot.

I have had my eye on this game for months, and bought it at Origins 04.  You really have some interesting decisions to make when playing this game.  When I was first reading about the game, I didn't really understand how effectively you can block people in this game.  Sure, it is nearly impossible to block a loan explorer, but a loan explorer is rarely significant.  I love the gambling element about digging for treasure and placing guards.  Do I guard early, or wait until I have a more valuable temple, but have to lose alot of explorers to guard it?  There is plenty of interaction, but it rarely feels like screwage.  Its just a nice balance.  Our group is prone to AP, but I am a patient person, and patience is its own reward in this fascinating game.

I was scared of playing this game for ages because of its reputation for inducing analysis paralysis, something I can be prone to, but it's really not that bad.

The 'mini Tikal' variant is great for learning the rules, which are refreshingly simple, then we went on to the full game. Very enjoyable. It's 'thinky' but not too much so. Luck in the form of tile draws takes the pressure off nicely for me, allowing a focus on tactical play.

It really feels like you're playing an 'elderly statesman' of a game; classy and streamlined.

À essayer. À rejouer dans sa version professionnelle (enchères). Dans ce dernier cas, il se compare à Mexica et Java dans la profondeur et dans les prises de décisions. Car jouer à Tikal dans la version de base, c'est devoir subir le hasard (lors de la pioche de tuiles). Si vous piocher de mauvaises tuiles, cela vous désavantage clairement (vous n'avez pas l'initiative sur les trésors, les pyramides et le positionnement des explorateurs en vue des majorités). Il en va de même pour ce que les joueurs devant vous pioche (si le joueur qui vous précède pioche des tuiles trésor, vous avez une occasion de capturer des trésors à votre tour; très difficile autrement).

One play with auctions, one vanilla.  I really liked the auction variant, though this does increase the liability to AP: there are a lot of decisions to make on your turn which you can't make ahead of time, not being able to predict with certainty turn order or tile choice, and especially in the 'volcano round' they often require calculation rather than intuition.

The Good: The action-point system really gives the brain a workout...

The Bad: ...when you are the active player. There's not much to do between turns. Oh, I try to draw up plans for my next turn. But the tile-draws keep things fluid enough that you hit a point of diminishing returns pretty quickly.

The Ugly: The action-point system almost demands some analysis-paralysis during scoring rounds -- which can really stretch that downtime. 

Still, it's really pretty, mostly fun, and there are a lot of hard decisions to make -- all-in-all a very good game. It's just the kind of game I enjoy more over the interweb (SBW) where time between rounds isn't an issue (unless, natch, someone goes on holiday mid-game).

The second of the mask trilogy I've played, after [gameid=855].  I enjoyed this one more than Java.  It's not exactly a fast game, but also doesn't seem too overburdened by the problems of analysis paralysis that I hear about it.  The actions are intuitive enough, and there's lots of planning for the future.  Sure, the camp might not be a great strategy now, but it could reap dividends next turn.  And sometimes you're going to have to spend the resources to create a guard.  The theme could be neat, but unfortunately misses as somewhat strangely abstracted in odd ways.  It doesn't see like exploring when the players get to decide where the temples are.  I do like how clusters of the map will be more accessible to certain players, and other areas will be way too far away from any kind of strong point.

Overall, a much better, meatier, thinkier game than Tikal II. Love everything about it: the element of exploration, thinking about positioning the tiles, messing with other players to make sure they don't get too far ahead, area control, and the auction. Several clever mechanics make the game fair and balanced and there is even a catch-up mechanic in the end game scoring that gives priority to least points amassed in ascending order. I would want to own this but don't have a regular group of 4 non-AP players, plus Eugene and corn already own it. This game can be a killer with AP.

Auction Rules. 

Tikal is a solid game with a great theme/presentation.

This is interesting, but I can see this being a serious problem for AP-prone players.  I liked playing through a PBEM format, because it eliminated the downtime issues that are problematic in the game.  I'd be interested in playing it face-to-face sometime, but I imagine I would get frustrated, depending on the group playing it.  In the past, my groups have been AP-prone, and I imagine this taking FAR too long with them.

2 plays: 4 players

AUCTION VARIANT: Good Lord, if the base game doesn't take long enough for you, try the auction variant.  It's frustrating to be at the end of the turn order during the auction, though, since even if everyone else passes, you're in a position to either bid, or go last ... AGAIN.  Going last means getting the crappiest tile to play, and thus reducing your points even further.  So it's an endless cycle, unless you're willing to part with your hard-earned points.

Tikal is a game of exploration within the Central American jungles in search of lost temples and the treasures within. Players send their team of explorers into the jungle, exposing more and more of the terrain. Along the way, you find temples that require further uncovering and treasures. Players attempt to score points for occupying temples and holding onto treasure.

Pretty amazing for its age - but its age is felt in the play-length. Could do with maybe a 20 to 30% trim, but unsure how to do it, as it feels like the full game needs to run its course.

Shame, because there doesn't seem to be a widely available contemporary for the moment, as the game is still in print and I guess everyone's happy with it.

A tile-placement area-control game where players explore the jungle of Tikal. My first impression is that the non-auction variant has too much luck. However, perhaps more experience and knowing which tiles come up when will even it out. It is an interesting and unique game.

Played it many times with my oldest daughter as a 2 player game, the basic game not the auction. Both my daughter and I enjoyd this game very much. It easy to understand but deep in strategy even in a 2 player game. My daughter playes quit well, I have to play at my best for a victory. Would like to play it with more players, I'm thinking of a 4-player game. It should give a hard competition on the board I think.

My youngest daughter had just learned the game. She liked it very much, especially the treasures draw her attention. She took them all :)...and yes, she won her first game against her father. 

The look on her face after her victory, thank you for that Mr. Kiesling and Mr. Kramer!

My first German game.  It's good, but not great.  To play well, you must think things through.  But that slows it down too much, and the fact is that all your planning goes out the window when the next tile is laid.  Most of it, anyway.  Still, an enjoyable game, and just gorgeous as it unfolds.

It's been a while since I played this one, but I still like it a lot.  It's pretty amazing how far game design as come, as I suspect Tikal would likely get panned today because of the downtime between turns.  Even though I like it, there are certain people I would not play it with due to AP issues.

Definitely in my top ten games of all time. The warm colors of the board and components really make you feel like you're uncovering temples and digging up treasure. You get ten actions a turn, which is sufficiently challenging without the game turning into a brain burning analysis paralysis match. Works really nice as a gateway game and the board looks progressively amazing as the game goes on. If you can find it second hand somewhere, get it!

Competing teams of archeologists set out to mow down the tropical jungle in search of lost civilizations to defile their temples and sacred burial grounds to loot and claim unimaginable riches. I like to think of my team led by Indiana Jones trying to preserve these cultures and rain forests. Belloq! these relics belong in a museum. This is one of my favorite worker placements. The action point choices combined with exploring the terrain tiles creates the most intense decision making. Some rounds will take my wife ten minutes to optimize her move and I don't even mind--Just let me know when you are done honey.

Have only played a "learning" game so far with 3 players total.  This game went by MUCH faster than I thought it would (maybe an hour?), especially for a learning game.

Will play again and expect my rating to go up.

Tikal is een klassieker (ook al is het maar 12 jaar oud) die zich nog steeds staande houdt tussen alle nieuwe uitgaven.

Elke speler legt een nieuwe ontdekkingstegel aan het bord als hij/zij aan de beurt is. Hierna mogen ze een aantal acties uitvoeren. Hier hebben ze 10 punten voor en iedere actie kost een aantal punten. Spelers kunnen tempels verkennen, of schatten opgraven, maar ook nieuwe archeologen en basiskampen opzetten.

Het spel is lekker snel gespeeld en heeft genoeg uitdaging in zich om vaker te blijven te boeien.

RATING: 4
For what is a deep thinking game I felt like there was too much unmitigated randomness (luck) in the tile draws, especially in the artifacts. Our game had some real winkiness with one guy never getting to place his second tent due to lack of the open tiles and another guy having three full sets of treasure. 

I don't mind luck all that much depending on the game. This one I felt like just had the luck totally out of place. It would be like blindly drawing your Hive tiles. It just felt like a klunky mechanic and made the game unenjoyable to me. (Which is a pity because it did have a lot of other things going for it)

It is a very pretty game but I wish the colors were more standard. I couldn't be blue! (A very minor gripe)

I'm told there is a variant that allows bidding VP's for the tiles, I'd like to try that as I think it would take away most of my frustrations.

A couple of plays on SBW. Love the artwork and theme, but it seems the action points give you so many choices, and which is best depends so much on what your opponents do, and on luck in some cases. Basically it's a lot of work to select the best option, and you don't have enough control to justify that much work, so to enjoy it I have to "role play" the game and worry about playing well.

In addition I'm not usually a huge fan of area majority games and you can see why I rate it lower than most of BGG does. Still not a bad game though, I'll happily play it if somebody else wants to, just not something I would select.

Very good theme and components.  Plays *much* better with the auction version.  The auction version keeps you more involved (since you have to think about what you would have done with each tile, you now care about what your opponent is doing) and makes the downtime unnoticeable.  Also, here's an analysis paralysis avoidance trick:  as you play this game more you develope rules about what to fight for and the conflicts become less frequent(i.e. more negotiated) resulting in a fast game. in particular if a pyramid is 4 moves for you and 2 moves from the other guy let him have it because he can move men there twice as good as you.  Once it becomes clear whose winning then you can resume fighting for them.

Auction variant adds a little more control in tiles, but adds downtime and detracts from theme. Scoring doesn't provide enough options for me. Sometimes, it's AP prone.

7.5 after 1 play.

Gameplay is interactive and tactical in nature. Downtime can be on the longer side. Setting up camps at suitable sites and achieving some form of balance between temples and artifacts seem important towards setting one up for the endgame. Game component quality is reasonable. The difficulty in moving to far away sites does limit options and players may find themselves boxed in with few scoring opportunities at the end of the game.

Fun for a while, but almost too many Action Points available per turn -- leading to the much dreaded downtime between turns as this feeds Analysis Paralysis. Also, the option to steal an artifact from other players seems out of balance with other actions, as it's incredibly hard to defend against, and a no-brainer in terms of a significant upgrade in points (as well as then making your collection untouchable).

I liked most of the choices to be made each round in Tikal.  Placing the tiles seemed to have a greater stake than in a game like Carcassonne and I enjoyed planning out how I was going to use my 10 points each turn.  We did miss the rule about only claiming 2 sites... I'd like to play again with the proper rules and I think the added tension will likely bump my rating up a bit.

Another one of Kramer's "optimize your turn" games. Reminds me of Goldland in many ways. Despite the theme the game feels cold and clinical. Often there's a feeling of aimlessness. Upgrading temples will only attract other players' explorers, so you just make more explorers yourself, and there isn't much else to do if there aren't any treasure sites to scavenge. So, on a lot of turns you just make explorers, hop them around a bit and wait for a scoring turn or treasure site to arrive. The game looks very cool, but in the end isn't just very much fun.

I really like games such as Tikal which give you many choices to win.  At first it seemed very daunting with the decisions you can make each turn, whether to dig to increase the value of the temple, to excavate the treasures, or to advance your units further to grab the advantage on newly discovered places.  The randomness of the tiles you draw, as well as the strategic placement that will allow you the best access while deterring or even denying your opponents from entering, makes the game even more complex and exciting.  I don't know if it will stand up to multiple plays, but for now I can't wait to get another game going.

This is a really solid, fun action point game.  I don't think I've played it enough to *really* appreciate it, but I've liked what I've played so far.  I think my favorite in the series is Mexica (maybe because I know my wife will play that one with me any time).

One of my favourites, mostly because of the theme and the art (and also the mechanics are good). Very tactical, quite a lot of possibilities. Tremendous artwork.

I still like this game, but haven't played it a long time. There are other games that need to catch up to this playing time wise.

I guess it costed 7900 HUF.

This game lives up to the rest of the mask series of games and can be played with 2-4 players equally well, although if you're die-hard for PvP conflicts, then you'll want to go blasting with a full table.

Számomra ez volt az a játék, mely elhitette, hogy egy táblás társasjáték még felnőtt korban is nagyszerű élmény lehet. Azóta szenvedélyes társasjátékgyűjtővé váltam, bár ez nem jelent nagy gyűjteményt. Inkább a különleges darabokat keresem, melyek beindítják a fantáziát, kicsi bennük a szerencse faktor, viszont sok logikát és taktikázást, és stratégiai gondolkodást igényelnek. Esetleg még egyedi játékmechanizmust is. Ja, és ne tartson hosszú órákon át, mert a mindennapi életem annyi időre nem ad lehetőséget.  A Tikál majdnem ilyen. 
(Azt leszámítva, hogy ha ritkán játszik vele az ember, a szabályokat átböngészni sok idő, és a játék ideje sem kevés. Ez az egyedüli ok, ami miatt ritkán kerül elő).

Lenyűgöző az a mechanizmus, ahogyan egy dzsungel sűrűjéből előkerülnek a maja templomok, ráadásul ezek a templomok még térben is növekszenek, ahogyan egyre több szintet ásnak ki belőlük a régészcsapatok. De van itt rejtett kincs és aktív vetélkedés is egymás ellen. Mindez káprázatos rajzokkal övezve.

Nagyjából 17 éve van meg ez a társas, és ma is ugyanolyan kreatív, komplex játékélménynek találom, mint akkor, amikor megvettem.

Konečně jsem se seznámil s touto hrou, po které jsem již delší dobu pošilhával. A opravdu mne zaujala (i když jsem zklamán, protože jsem myslel, že je na Yucata). Je to hezky zpracovaná hra se zajímavým námětem archeloogie v mexickém pralese a závod s ostatními tými o artefakty a objevování pyramid..

RATING: 7
Ten action points makes for too large a decision tree.    

Paths are counterintuitive...the fewer pathstones there are, the easier it is to go that way--until you get to zero pathstones, in which case you can't go that way at all, even though the tile art shows a clear path.

In spite of these complaints it's a pretty good game, one I'd be happy to play again.

After 2+ Plays: I wasn't blown away by my first play, but I enjoyed my second play more.  I've recently been wanting to try it again, so I'll have to see if this improving trend continues.

After 5+ Plays: My opinion is pretty steady by now.  A solid game, but not one I suggest.

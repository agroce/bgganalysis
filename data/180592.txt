LIKE: This is quite a deep puzzle. So many interconnected options, which makes this game interesting. Very colorful board.
DISLIKE: Quite themeless, where your actions don't really explain why you get the bonuses. The game is fiddly for setup and round to round. Possible overpowered green cards have been reported, but I haven't encountered this, but easily fixed (deal one less card per round). Analysis paralysis inducing, be wary with 4 players.

OVERALL: An interesting brain-burner, point-salad, but not bad. Yes, there is a tiny bit of interaction and is possible to purposefully block other players, as some of the paths are first-come first serve.
Reminds me of other games, Shipyard and Russian Railroads.

I played this game just once, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

I wasn't expecting much from this game, when I set down to play it. I actually though I was really going to hate it, as I wasn't interested at all in the theme nor I liked its artwork. I have to admit instead, that I was kinda positively surprised to see that there's actually a seemingly enjoyable design in this box.

Steam Time is surely not a game that will blow you away, it's also definitively nothing really unique or innovative... but it has a set of robust mechanisms and it offers a few paths to victory, that are fun to explore. A huge part of my enjoyment comes from the possibility of personalizing your own ship. I'm a big sucker for games with player boards where you can build improvements. Steam Time definitively fits that bill. I also like the action selection mechanism, that forces you to deny yourself some options in order to get what you really want before anyone else. Even the market mechanism I found to be quite clever in its simplicity thanks to the changing value of the different crystals and the limited access to the different kinds.

At the same time a lot of things could have been done better in my opinion. The whole graphic presentation could have been nicer, some of the iconography could be more intuitive and less abstract. I'm also not a fan of the encounter cards, since you can't really be sure to get something useful out of them. I understand it's maybe supposed to be chaotic and random, but so far I just didn't see a reason to go for this route, when I can choose an action that gives me much more control over the results. The same thing could be said about the mission cards, that are maybe even more random! These two mechanisms, while they might have been a good idea to add some flavor, seem almost pasted on the game to me.

Therefore Steam Time is a good product, but not a great one. It did surprise me, so I must give it that. Yet I ended up wishing that the game could have been put together just a little bit better. It's fun and very enjoyable... but it's also a missed chance for something really good.

There's a game here, but not enough variety or interest to warrant owning.  Crystal boosting and spending is sort of ok, but feels like you don't DO anything interesting at all.  Very same-ish worker placement.  Egizia is better, for the "flow" thing, and we got rid of that.

A rather innovative worker-placement game with enough randomness to keep things interesting. Like so many games, it appears that the best strategy is to avoid doing what everyone else is doing. Player interaction is quite minimal, alas.

A good effort was put into pasting on the theme; but pasted on it remains. I suspect the colour choices might make Steam Time a nightmare for the colour blind.

RATING: 4
Beneath a thin veneer of steampunky time travel, Steam Time is about converting resources (gems of various colours) into things that score points and doing it as efficiently as possible.  The time travel element only makes itself felt in the way that the available actions are in bands of time and can only be selected in ascending band order.  According to taste (yours) this either adds a degree of interest or (mine) a degree of frustration.  It can also make turn order quite important.  Choose an action late in the turn and find the best ones in a low band all gone.  Do you take a weak action or move up the bands, restricting your later choices?  At least it is possible to take over as first player as an action.  But wait, I'm making this game seem more interesting than it is; from start to finish it's a chin-stroking optimizer with six resources, a hatful of things to ponder converting them into, and no need at all to communicate with your fellow players.

In terms of artwork Steam Time is a mixed bag.  All of it is very colourful, though some of it is plain gaudy.  Production quality is to Kosmos' best standards.

RATING: 6.3
The theme is not just pasted on, it's barely noticeable. The description on the BGG entry about time travel, treasure, vanished cultures is enticing and colourful, but trust me, none of that comes through at all while playing the game. This is a generic worker placement game where the goal is to collect various resources and convert them into points, sometimes directly and sometimes from end-game scoring cards. The conversion from resources (6-8 types) to points is more convoluted that usual, and the types of resources that one must pay for things changes randomly with each round - an unnecessary and irritating complication. 

Does this game do anything new? You have three airships (workers) you place on locations on the time stream. Each subsequent ship must go forward, never backward, on the time stream. This is an interesting mechanism that's done very well, and adds a great deal of tension, in games like Egizia and Francis Drake. Here, it's nice but not that noticeable really, and the fact that the order of the time stream eras changes from round to round seems, like the randomisation of resource costs, a complication added in for the sake of complication rather than for real benefit to the game play. 

In sum, this is an average euro game with a hodge podge of scoring mechanics that seems to rely on making it particularly difficult to calculate resource-to-victory point conversion (but not in a good way). 

I would happily play it again, and do want to just for the challenge of figuring out how to make it work. For anyone who likes puzzle-like euros, this is not a bad game, just one that's destined for obscurity amid the many more appealing games of this genre.

This is a steampunk themed worker placement game that uses airships to go on expeditions, mine for crystals, upgrade your ship, and earn bonus point.  The game is played over five rounds and the goal is to establish the most esteem (VP's).

probably my favorite game that i played at bgg-con 2015. it's a resource management/worker placement that also allows you to build an engine...kind of. your engine components are also resources for raw VPs, but not trading them in can ramp up your rewards. medium-to-heavy weight euro style game that plays fairly quickly but offers tremendous variation!

Super fun worker placement. I love the components and visual appeal of this game. The time mechanism works very well. Basically, you have to go further in the time stream (another action strip up) with each of your workers. Every action has potential bonuses associated with it based on how many gems of that particular color you have. This one fits into that mid-weight Euro game, which is a family that is sorely lacking in good games, IMO. I plan to introduce this to Flo as well as I think she will like it. Keeper!

Played 3 or 4 times and liked it less each time. Initially it all seems great. Looks, mechanics, variation, multiple little routes to take. But the execution is far from clean. Too fiddly.

The thing that bothered me the most in each game is the constant feeling of running into invisible walls. For instance, the rule that prohibits taking an action on a previous monument board limits your options sometimes in such a way that there are only suboptimal choices. Not necessarily a problem, but those moments are difficult to gauge beforehand and affect some players more than others. 

For me the game is too random to warrant the play time and effort you put in.

It's a pity. I really wanted to like this one,

Good med+ euro.  The changing crystal market really keeps you on your toes and can sort of screw up the plans you spent a round working towards.  But then just make new plans!  Adolescent art style doesn't fit the grown-up level of puzzle and play.

Interesting game with a LOT going on.  Keith Levy taught Ajax, Angry Brian and me at Prezcon 2017.  Has some interesting mechanics--once you select your first action, you have to take one farther ahead in time (like Egizia) and at the end of each round the modular board gets re-arranged.  I would play again, but don't need to own just yet--I would rather play Egizia.

A nice little puzzly point-salad with some push-your-luck mechanics. Tensions can get high here, as players wait to see how much they can do before jumping ahead to something they really want. The (literal) engine-building mechanic is smoothly and cleverly implemented by the position of gems on your board, and the gameplay feels very intuitive as a whole. 

I do think there are some slight balance problems in the random encounter cards, which can be frustrating, as they arbitrarily reward some lucky players over others, but it doesn't ruin the game for me. Very fun, medium-weight Euro that is definitely a keeper for me.

Very euro. Worker placement where there are multiple of each action space with subtle differences, including a progression of time, where you can only place your worker ahead in time of your previous worker. Each action type can be supercharged by collecting gems of the appropriate type. And then there are also various ways of spending those gems. There's a good balance between having gems being an engine, and spending gems for using things. My only real concern with the game is that there's some randomness in encounter cards, but the variance in how good they are (usually applies to only the player who draws them) is a bit high.

First impression: Ah, Rüdiger Dorn made a Gamers Game again! The theme is thin, but the mechanism is great. Action drafting aka Worker Placement is the engine, lots of decisions to take and no one is easy. Collect lots of crystals to take better actions later. But VP costs you crystals, too! When to do what? And will your fellow gamers cross your finelayed plans? Again?! I enjoyed my first play very much and be eager to play it again soon.

The twist to this worker placement game is that the action you select comes with a bonus, the strength of which is determined by the number of crystals allocated to that bonus. However, the crystals also are needed for expeditions and upgrades, so you have to make trade-offs: either better bonuses or more upgrades and expeditions. With only 15 regular actions (and usually a few more special ones) per game, you really cannot waste any, so beware of playing with efficiency experts.

A pretty run of the mill worker placement game, with the added placement constraints being its novel quality. The engine building aspect is fun, as each gem collected makes a specific action more enticing, but eventually you will have to spend those gems and slow your engine back down. This cyclical style of engine building creates a need for optimal timing, which itself adds another layer strategy. The biggest short coming is that there is little need to adapt successful strategies from one game to the next. One could easy implement one strategy again and again. Here's my go to; get gray gems early and hoard cash, then build a steam engine while acquiring as many yellow gems as possible, and finally cash out steam to convert gray/green/red gems to complete quests and acquire upgrades. Rinse and repeat.

Steam Time may look like happy day with the family at the fun fair but it quickly becomes apparent that behind the partly colourful, partly hideous (and sometimes both at the same time) veneer hides a ruthless optimization game that punishes squandered actions without remorse.

Unfortunately, the major task in the game is merely sequencing your actions correctly to maximize your score. The other players sometimes do interfere with those plans but that's typically by coincidence rather than spite. Juggling the various different resources efficiently is much more important than keeping an eye on the competition so while Steam Time is quite challenging to play it focuses that challenge on the least interesting parts of the game.

Grottenhäßliches Cover, blöder Titel, gequältes Zeitgeist-Thema, Zielgruppe Kennerspiel-Mainstream. Aber dann tut sich plötzlich ein süßes WP-Spiel auf. Es geht um den Erwerb von bunten Kristallen, die man braucht um diverse Funktionen auf seiner Luftschiff in Gang zu kriegen. Das Dilemma: Eben jene Kristalle braucht man wiederum, um Dinge zu tun, die Siegpunkte bringen. Auf einem Zeitstrom Marke "Nil-in-EGIZIA" setzt man seine drei Luftschiffe auf Aktionsfelder für Kristalle, Luftschiff-Upgrades, Gold, Expeditionen, Schlußwertungs-Aufträge. Alles greift redaktionell mit Popper-Brillantine geschmiert glatt ineinander zu Entscheidungszwängen: Die Aktion oder die Aktion? Dies oder jenes? Wenn man das wahllose und herrlich zu bunt geratene "Steampunk" wohlwollend durch Jules Verne ersetzt und in der farbenfrohen, glückhaften Welt das Kind im Spieler zu erkennen vermag, dann ist STEAM TIME ein schönes, altbekanntes, vergängliches Spiel mit herzlichen Charme zwischen Geschmacksverirrung und Süßigkeit.

Steam Time has a really interesting mechanic here: using crystals which power the player's main actions, but the crystals are also used for money to buy other required things.  This system alone created a lot of good thought that had to be put in to make things work.  Everything functions just fine otherwise. I am a HUGE fan of Dorn, but unfortunately I found Steam Time to be so much about its mechanics first and theme a distant second.  I do think that a Euro designed in 2015 has to do a bit better with layering thematic tones over mechanics that can easily feel abstract.  Steam Time lays on a bit of a "time travel / build your air balloon" theme, but it comes off as a most paper-thin implementation.  Because the mechanics are so heavily Euro, you really feel like you're managing mechanics rather than anything tangible.  As such, I felt sort of divorced from the experience the whole time.  But the game gets a satisfactory rating from me based alone on the primary mechanic described above. It really is smart and I hope Dorn applies it to another game in the future.  (He often reuses core mechanics in his designs and often to great effect.)

On a whim got this on the cheap and I'm glad that I did. It's another worker placement game, but it has some fun unique things about it. The order in which you place your ships matters since you have to go along the "Stream of Time." There are some things you'd like to right away, but you're cutting yourself off from other possible actions. The way the board subtly changes from round to round is a nice touch also. There's a variety of ways to go, strategically. I went all-in on upgrades while others went expedition crazy. In the end, the scores were very close. Fun game that doesn't overstay it's welcome. It's a sleeper!

RATING: 8
Quite good and solid design, but a little dry. The interesting time-travel steampunk theme is very superficial.

The board is modular, composed of tiles that shift every round. The worker placement is a bit similar to that of "Egizia": you must follow the "flow of time" and always place your airships on tiles above the ones you have already visited. The actual twist is that you acquire colored crystals to power your actions, but you constantly have to spend those same crystals to buy cards or upgrades. This gives a unique feeling to what would otherwise be simple resource conversion.

The components and artwork are satisfactory, but nothing special. I noticed that new players, for some reason, tend to place the airships upside down, so that they look like submarines, despite the big picture on each personal board. Plastic miniatures or even stickers on the sides of the wooden pieces would have been a huge improvement.

Point salad game worker placement game. You have 3 actions a round, but they can only be selected from left-to-right on the board (kind of like Egizia). There are several different engines; when you do a job you afterwards get the benefit of the corresponding engine. However, you're constantly having to pay crystals to acquire tiles that give you an every-round benefit or points. Paying those crystals will ruin some type of engine less effective or useless (until you refill it with more crystals again). There is an ability to fudge the required crystal colors around using "steam" (another resource), but of course you will have to spend time getting that steam back if you want to keep using it.

Every round, the stuff on the boards resets and the last placement row shifts to the front (just to keep it variable). A neat little puzzle thing. Game ends after 5 rounds.

RATING: 8
This is so cool!  You can get bonuses for doing different actions by putting gems in your machine, but you have to spend the gems to get victory points. But then also, the costs for things will shift over time.  I like the "time" element of the game (you need to continue moving forward in time), but also the way that it shifts from turn to turn. Along with this, the fact that each era doesn't include one of the actions makes the "downstream" mechanism much more interesting.  And then there's Mr. Time. It's not a very heavy game, but there are lots of different things you can do and it's fun. (2 plays)

1/17/16: Solid worker placement/engine building game. Coordinating good main actions with things whose bonus action you're equipped to take advantage of is good, and the way you have to work your way up the board can make things harder for you in a good way. But there was something about it that just left me slightly more lukewarm then I expected. Maybe in spite of all of the moving parts, things felt a bit too straightforward.

UPDATE: Played it again and it went down a half point. I think one thing I became aware of in the last play was why it feels straightforward. Even though there are bonus actions for each action it's mostly the case that the bonuses are just more of the thing you're getting, e.g. buying crystals gets you more crystals, getting money comes with more money, end game point cards come with immediate points. So in the end it sort of just feels like a cycle of money -> crystals -> points repeat. Certainly there are decisions to be made and it's quick and easy enough that it's fine that it's a little simple, but it doesn't excite me.

Steam Time takes the Egizia principle of directed action selection, this time 'upwards', and coats it into a steam punk time traveller outfit. Points can be scored in various ways (tasks, expeditions, ship improvements etc.). Each way can be augmented by gathering the related crystals. The innovative part is that in order to improve the crystal engineor utilize the engine to score, parts of the engine have to be dismantled again as payments.

The rules explanation was promising. The resulting gameplay was unspectacular. Our group of seasoned eurogamers took care to keep the crystal augmentation of actions on high levels for the selected actions. The various different ways proved to be equally strong as we all ended within a few points difference. Polished, balanced, non-surprising, ultimately average. It doesn't help that I don't like the theme and the artwork.

Another worker placement game.  Does it have anything the others don't?  Besides Zeppelins/Airships?  Not really.  Tactical due to the variable costs per turn.  Rises a bit above the genre, but I'm not sure I'd rather play it than standards such as Agricola/Caverna or even Lords of Waterdeep.

We played it for the first time today and completed two games.  I prefer it to Istanbul because it is meatier.  I'm becoming a Dorn fanboy and really want to check out Goa.

This is an okay game if your blind.  The gameplay is okay; nothing bad, nothing exciting.  But open your eyes and take a look at the gaudy patchwork of colors.  Bleech!  Even if the gameplay was stellar, I wouldn't pay to own this ugly production.  And the theme is not even there.  I thought the player pieces were little submarines until I asked another player why he kept placing his upside-down.  The little odd shaped gems are difficult to pick up when they're sitting in the little holes on the board.

RATING: 7.5
Attractive, colorful board, love the look of the components, but the gameplay doesn't quite live up to those lofty standards. Lacking a bit in depth, it plays fast, and skews toward the lighter end of mid-weight Euro. Not a bad game by any stretch, just a little bit ho-hum once you get done admiring the graphic design and artwork.

Great review from the Dice Tower put this on my radar. Like Tom, I'm a a huge fan of having a ton of options when choosing actions and this one offers a lot. I like the WP and the 'should I buy something with this gem or keep it for a better score' balancing this game does. I'll be keeping my eye out for a copy.

I really like this. Sure, it doesn't bring anything new to 'worker placement' -genre, but what it does, it does it right way and very smoothly. And maybe that's the reason why you'll play Steam Time in 90 minutes with maximum number of players which is excellent compared to what it offers: great mix of short and longtime strategies, enough hidden information and blocking your opponents. Very enjoyable game. And very gorgeous components and there aren't any usability issues. Well made Dorn & Kosmos.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Initially feels complex but this one ends up being fairly simple. The challenge is picking a path or two and trying to focus on strengthening those to earn the most points. Each action also potentially grants a bonus action based on the number of gems of the color associated with the action you have in your time machine. Appears to have multiple paths to win at first blush.

RATING: 8
Fun! There is a unique combination of the board action slots shifting every round with a restriction that you have to place your workers sequentially further ahead (like Francis Drake), making this more than just a typical worker placement.

The main currency of crystals also serves to improve your ship's capability during the game. You experience moments where you feel powerful, but then typically have to give much of it up when you take certain actions and then work to get crystals back.

Intresting.  I like how you can customize your ship to your strategy, but the game feels a bit... broken.  Going orange (adventuring) feels like you get much less of a profit.  I like how the stream of time is constantly changing, but in the the end it's not enough to draw me in consistently.  The theme is very pasted.  Something about it just isn't engaging, but I'm not sure what.  I really wanted to love this game, especially with its awesome aesthetics.

RATING: 8
Nice engine building worker placement game where the original twist is that you need to break down your engine to score the most points and take the most powerful actions, so you're constantly building up and breaking down your engine.

Moved up to an 8 after my second play. Enjoyed my first game but suspected the strategy might samey. To my surprise, my second game was more interesting than my first. The tension between building up and breaking down your engine gives you some agonizing choices - it's not like some games where each turn you just make the best tactical move, or games where you start by building a big engine and then you just roll with it.

A pretty run-of-the-mill worker placement game. Cool theme, and I like the placement rules of only being able to go forward in time rather than backwards after you've placed your first airship. The one thing holding this game back for me is how much of an efficiency exercise it felt like. Not only that, but it's pretty much a dressed-up cube-pusher. I didn't mind the game too much, but it's not something I ever need to play again.

Graphically, this is a garish game, but the gameplay is extremely solid. With only fifteen guaranteed actions over the course of the game, your focus shifts toward earning bonus actions. The trick is that one of the game's forms of currency reduces the power of those bonus actions, and there's no good way to avoid spending it. This constant tug of war between building your engine and sacrificing it for necessary point gains is compelling and elegantly handled.

This one is a gem (no pun intended). It's a worker placement with time traveling, though the theme is not as strong as in, say, Anachrony.

I like that the action spaces feel tight and the resources feel tight as well. I really like that everything in the game is color-coded and connected (by color) to the other aspects of its mechanisms. This might be troublesome to people who are colorblind, but there are also icons. Let me explain:

I like that the colored gems are tied to the color of the various action spaces on the board, which are also connected to the various sections on the player boards, which are color-coded to the gems. So it all ties into itself, full circle.

Each action let's you compete in various ways to score points. The degree of effectiveness your player board gives you is measured by how many gems you have on your board, but gems are also one of the main resources you spend to get ahead in other areas, so it's a nice trade-off to think about. Overall, I dig this game.

A cutthroat Euro family game?

Steam Time is difficult to describe. Rudiger Dorn has designed a time-travel-themed worker-placement boardgame where each player will have minimum of 3 worker actions per round in the 5 round game. There are many choices for each competitive action space, all of which involve managing money, various colored crystals, or steam, and have a potential, particular, personal bonus. The crux of the game is how to convert all of that into points throughout the game and it's end.

Though the above description can describe a cool game, I found Steam Time to be an unintuitive engagement of endless frustration. Normally I love Dorn's designs. This one is hard for me to like because of how easy it is to shoot yourself in the foot. Thus, AP alert, due to the puzzles of how to work out tactics and strategy.

Very nice art, graphics, and components. Each game will play differently.

The english rules have some errors and omissions, but there is a FAQ.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Sweeeeeet! Rüdiger Dorn is on it again!!! This game is tough though, there are so many options that you really struggle to take full advantage when you play for the first time.

I'm really looking forward to trying this again. Big plus for scaling perfectly well with the different player count.

Aaaaand! It looks pretty (although a little confusing).

Ok, tried it for the first with the modules and this is a lot better with a lot more chances of scoring high. Recommended to always play with at least the specialists. The saboteurs is optional.

A unique Steampunk-themed worker placement game.  Enough said!  Easily a medium weight game.  A little heavier if you use the character cards (which adds some good variability to the game).  I love how selecting a certain colored action gets you the bonus action that relates to that action's color.  Different routes to victory.  And each round the board shifts (very  cool).  And it's nice just to look at!

RATING: 8
While Steam Time definitely is a eurogame, it definitely has a different feel to it. In this game you're trying to collect differently-colored crystals that you can spend on upgrades to get income, expeditions to get one-time points and other bonuses, or save them until the end of the game and use contacts you've acquired to turn them into points. The trick is, you store the crystals on your player board, and they make each of the actions you can perform better depending on their color. So as the game proceeds, you're constantly acquiring crystals and making your engine work better, and spending them and making it work worse. The action system itself is and Egizia-like worker placement system where you can't go backward (in time, thematically). Overall, I found the game to be well put-together, and provided players with plenty to think about as they gained and spent their crystals.

An excellent worker placement game with a bit of Feldian point salad and a fun twist on engine building. You can build up your engine for color-coded bonuses, but you can also dismantle your engine to buy upgrades and expeditions. As with any worker placement game, there isn't enough time to do everything you want to do, but the gameplay is rewarding rather than punishing--there's always something good to do. It's also worth mentioning that the boards are a pleasure to look at.

Dorn does not disappoint with yet another solid euro to his name. The game looks attractive on the table with bright inviting colors and an interesting, if whimsical, theme. The theme hangs in there about as well as most other euro games (i.e. some imagination needed), but  the end result is a fun and mercurial efficiency puzzle to solve. Player interaction is mostly in the form of competition for action spaces and, to a lesser extent, the placement of a saboteur token that can mess with opponents' plans. I very much enjoyed my couple of plays of Steam Time so far.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a pretty simple worker placement game about time travel. The thing that makes the game interesting is that you collect crystals of different kinds in order to make your actions more efficient, but the most rewarding actions cost crystals, so you have to time your actions to take advantage of your crystals when you can before spending them in order to take big actions.

The game is a nice, not too complicated, worker-placement game with one-way placement sort of like in Egizia and Francis Drake. There is usually more than just one good option for your action so it's not [i]overly[/i] tense, but you do care about your choice so turn order can be important. Several paths seem viable (concentrate on missions, expeditions, or upgrades/income) and you can build your engine in different ways to complement those paths. Like in Valley of the Kings, though, you have to dismantle your engine a bit to pay for some advances! There are several paths to victory, which gives you many options but can make it harder to decide what to do. Fortunately, taking mission cards early on can give you some direction. 

A fun middle-weight game. There are two included expansions:
- saboteur: allows you to block an action; haven't tried that one
- specialists: everyone has the same deck and can work their way through once. ou may have one of these active at a time. They modify your actions (allow you to go backwards in time when choosing actions, pay less for crystals, etc.). Pretty cool!

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
This is set in a steam punk 1900ish world. Crystals have been discovered, allowing travel through time. Airships, with several parts (bridge, engine, vault, etc., each represented on personal player boards), travel through time going on expeditions, collecting resources, upgrading our airships, all in an effort to earn Esteem (VP) with the Temporal Institute for Monument Exploration. This time, thankfully, INCLUDING a final period in the T.I.M.E. abbreviation ... _stupid_ T.I.M.E Stories!! 

The board consists of several slats in random order. Each slat has up to 6 areas to take actions, each corresponding to an area of their player mat. Players each have 3 workers (airship tokens); in turn order, they'll place one on an empty action space further downstream from all their previously placed airships (alternatively, one player each round may take the Start Player token). The spaces do several things:
- award you a card for end-game VP (for meeting a variety of conditions)
- draw 2-3 cards and play one of them (usually to earn resources or turn resources into VP; some allow everyone else to do something as well)
- buy crystals (2 gold each), placed in matching (by color) areas of your board
- buy ship improvement (generally provides income in coins or crystals) by paying some combination of crystals
- take immediate cash (and possibly other bonuses)
- go on an expedition, earning VP and/or resources based on your "analytic engine" -- orange area of your board
Each of these actions corresponds to an area of your board, with up to 5 crystals there. The more crystals you have, the better bonus (earn VP, steam, wild-color crystal, or coins; advance your marker on your time portal track, giving you an extra action whenever you advance far enough)  you get. 

At the end of each round (when everyone has placed all their airships), move the top slat to the bottom of the board. You also reset the board, placing new crystals, missions, ship upgrades, and expeditions cards in the appropriate areas. Next round starts with the (new) Start player, with everyone first earning income according to their ship upgrade status. After 5 rounds, players earn VP for whichever mission cards they can fulfill. The player with the most VP wins!

RATING: 5
I love anything that is Steam Punk and anything that is related to Time Travel, so I went into this game with high hopes. I mostly enjoyed my first game, but liked it less and less the more I reflected back on it. When I played it a second time, I found it mostly boring.

The Good:
I do like the time boards themselves. I like the way each has multiple actions you can take, but not all of them. I also like the piece of having to move with the stream of time. This gives you multiple options on every turn, without making to much AP. My favorite part of the game is rotating the boards at the end of each turn. This has a nice tactile feel and changes your options from turn to turn. 

The Bad:
While I love the individual pieces of artwork, the game is lacking in visual cohesion. The colors and design look somewhat cluttered and mish-mashed when put all together. Although this game has some interesting options and the mechanics are smooth, I just find it stale at the end of the day. It had too much of that Feldian point-salad feel for my taste. 

Overall:
I think the game is well-designed and can definitely see why people would like it, but I found it a little too dry for my taste. I will probably be looking to sell this one.

Pure points generating engine.  While some elements and mechanisms toy with the temporal theme, the setting is a nonfactor.  Rather it’s a solid worker placement affair in which players have a good deal of freedom thanks to the number and array of options – still within a condensed time frame.  With so much to choose from and a limited number of actions to accomplish it all, it can induce mental paralysis.  However, the flip side is it offers lots to explore with plenty of avenues to move about the board and different means of developing and shaping your strategy. Heavier-end complexity for veteran gamers.

This is a hard one for me, I enjoy a number of parts in the game but it doesn't have enough for me to actively seek it out. With four players every action has the likelihood of blocking your "best" option leaving you to arrive at your turn grasping for what you should do, this can lead to longer turn times even for those that would usually be prepared. The theme is also VERY pasted on, there are no unique "oh, that's cool moments" that I would hope for in a time travel themed game. I guess collection the pink stuff that allows for an extra turn? Make a note that the play time is a bit optimistic the games I have played have been +120 minutes (including teaching... because... the people you are playing with would probably like to know how to play the game, right?).

Fun worker placement game.   The theme is pretty thin, but the graphics are lovely, and the bits are top quality.   It takes a game or two for stategies to become apparent.

Charming worker placement game about using your time traveling zeppelin to visit historical figures and collect resources (crystals) to further build your engine.  The idea of hiring father time for one extra turn is adorable. 

Some cons though. Numerous paths to victory on each turn can lead to AP. Some parts seem quite fiddly, like the game setup and the conversion of certain resources. Also, it's a shame the theme didn't come through more. But when it does, it shines.

Looking at the artwork and components this looks like a "fluffy" game and the mechanics partially support this feeling. Whatever you do you will be showered with benefits and usually you only need to consider which one will pamper you the most. However, the biggest issue with the game is not this, but the fact that it is really hard to plan ahead. You cannot be certain what kind of cards will come out, which stones will be available, and which adventures you can take. This high level of uncertainty makes the game tactical instead of strategic which is always something I dislike in games. This is not a bad game, but there are several more intriguing euros which I would pick over this one. Altogether everything adds up to a "meh", take it or leave it experience.

So far this is the best game I've played in 2016, and I don't see that changing unless some really amazing games come along.

This is a worker placement game but there is always something awesome that you can do on your turn. Somebody took the crystals that I wanted, so I'll just take a ton of money instead. Somebody took the card I needed, I'll take this upgrade that gives me free stuff every round.

There's also an element of managing different tech tracks that I really love. Each time you do an action you get some level of a bonus based on how far you are on the corresponding track. If you're higher on the track, you get a better bonus. The downside is that in order to pay for certain upgrades you have to remove crystals from different tracks, thus decreasing your bonus rewards. This makes for some interesting decisions and gives the game a nice flow as you build up your track, take that action a few times to get maximum effect, then dismantle that track to pay for upgrades.

I really like the way the start player is handled here too. On a turn you can either take an action or claim the start player marker. The first player of a round can't take the start marker for his first action, so every other player has a chance to take it first. You also get a small bonus for taking it and it doesn't count as one of your placements, so you still get your full number of actions. This is a refreshing change from other worker placement games (take an action to be the first player, or it stays with the same person) and it works very well.

There seems to be multiple ways of winning too. During a 4-player game we all took different different paths and the final scores ended up being within a few points of each other. The winning player would just get a few crystals and then quickly give them up in order to get upgrades, and also got end-game missions that gave points for upgrades. One player went heavy into money and got missions that give points for money. Another player also went for money bonuses and went into the orange track early. I played pretty conservatively, keeping my crystals almost fully stocked and getting valuable orange bonuses when possible then doing a mixture of other things.

I've seen people complain about the randomness of the blue cards and at this point I don't quite see it. They seem to all give you a nice boost, kind of like the Intrigue cards in Lords of Waterdeep, and you always get to draw two and keep one so you have some choice in the matter. Additionally, each time you take that action you get valuable steam for free based on how high you've built your blue track.

At this point I really don't have any issues with the game. If I had to think of one I would point out that it can be a little fiddly between rounds. You've got to take all crystals off the board and replace them with new ones then remove all cards and replace with new ones. Not much worse than most games, but not the simplest cleanup that I've seen between rounds.
Also it isn't at all colorblind friendly. You've got crystals that are all the same shape and come in red, green, blue, black, and gray. They're all in fairly dark shades too. Additionally you have to put those crystals onto your player board according to the matching color on the board itself. I'm only slightly colorblind and I didn't have any trouble, but I can see it being an issue for some people.

Excellent game, possibly even a 10 after I get more plays.

[b]Player Count Verdict: All[/b]
Because the boards change with different player counts to limit the number of actions, this seems to work fine for all player counts.

Not a lot of buzz around this one.  I enjoy this a lot, Dorn's games are almost a insta-buy for me. 

If there is a nitpick, it's the theme (not there at all) and the name (which makes me cringe).  But the game is great, if you can just look past it.

A standard Euro design from Goa designer Rudiger Dorn. Players power steam ships capable of time travel in search of multicolored crystals, gold and esteem points. The game centers around several currencies including gold, steam and crystals. All of these can be converted into esteem points or used to purchase upgrades, expeditions, etc. which will also end up scoring points. Like Goa, there are multiple ways to earn these currencies and score points, and so, multiple paths to victory. However, the theme feels loose and more abstracted than Goa. Collecting crystals to power your ship is fun but then, you spend these crystals buying stuff off the main board and not to power the ships themselves. So, there is  a disconnect from the theme. This is a shame because many gamers have commented on the excellent mechanics and were a little disappointed with the theme. 
    Overall, the game is just another worker placement, resource conversion mid-weight Euro. While all the mechanics meshed well together, I did not detect any novel elements in the game. Placing your time ships/workers based on a linear track has been seen in Egizia. I love games with multiple paths of specialization and ways to victory and Steam Time certainly fits the bill. However, the lack of theme really does bring it down a notch. 
    Components are top notch and productive values are good even though the color palatte can be a bit garish.

RATING: 7.5
Worker placement/resource management/optimization game with placement restrictions and upgrades to your personal board which chain to give you more resources. A lot of moving parts requiring advanced planning but basically a point salad. Scales at all counts with modular double-sided boards. Takes around 90 minutes at 4 without rule explanation. Takes about an hour with 2 but both players have to be familiar with the game in order for it to be competitive.Very nice components. Absolutely no theme but that doesn't bother me. Haven't played with the specialist cards yet but enjoyed the saboteur.

Edit: all resources are finite in the game, including money. Money is in very short supply in a 4 player game...not sure how I feel about the extra restriction as there is another element of racing to stock up and chaining your turns to consider. Might work as a check to tighten the game even further, even though it's already pretty tight. Will house rule this element if it seems too restricting/broken.

Great brain teasing core mechanics, but the locations, steam punk setting and encounters and even time travel are completely irrelevant to the game. This might as well be about a medieval mining and trade simulation and it were just as fun.

A solid title from Rudiger Dorn.  Great art, and something I'd be happy to play any time. 

But, it isn't anything unique - a game of turning stuff into other stuff into points like so many games before it.

Lots of ways to score points, and I like the look of the game. The theme feels a bit tenuous, and it wouldn't have killed the designers to branch out from the "dead white guys" category for the historical figure cards.

Worker placement time travel using our steam zeppelins to go back to see prominent historical leaders and events made possible by the vortex periods of the seven wonders. Install colored power crystals to upgrade zeppelins, take expeditions to complete missions. Simple and effective replay variability with random legend tiles A to F representing the different crystal colors. Richly colored board and components.

Played once. Despite the theme not really matching the mechanics of the game, the game is a super interesting take on Worker Placement mechanics. Choosing your end game goals is a unique thing that can screw you over at the end if you don't play toward them. Trying to do everything is also a recipe for disaster. Stick to your goals and you will do well. Plays quick (once you get the hang of it).

This game is fantastic, as are all game I've played by Dorn. Simple, easy to learn/follow mechanics, with the complexity all in the strategy. I could play this with my wife who is a lighter gamer, or bring it to my gaming groups where people are looking to be challenged and stimulated as much as possible. I love the theme which comes across beautifully, the art and pieces are top notch and easy to set up. This game SCREAMS expansions. Not just more monuments/cards to make it more modular than it already is, but more players as well. I also would think it would be cool to see upgrade tokens that can utilize crystals as well.... but this is a review not a suggestion box. Great game, highly recommend.

Worker placement, engine-building optimization with an interesting ebb and flow of building up and tearing down your resource engine of money, points, gems and time... very nice graphic design and bits, cool theme and a couple of modules in the box (a set of blocking tokens for each player and decks of player abilities for each player)... LOVE IT!

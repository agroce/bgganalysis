One of the best card games yet - set collection and travelling theme. Simple play, yet deep enough to be interesting. Tip: Buy as many cards as you can in a round and draw 3 (discard 4) to increase your play options.

[i]Posted: 2/2/13, Rated: 6[/i]

[i]King of the Elves[/i] is a faithful card game adaptation of [i][thing=10][/thing][/i] -- which is to say, it is still the same "traveling salesman" problem at heart.  The main difference is that without a board, you're not quite sure where you'll have to go -- the villages within the player realms are placed during the course of play each round.  That makes it difficult to plan for future rounds, unlike the board game where you can plan ahead based upon where your meeple will be.

The upside to the card version of the game is the delicious "starting reluctance" like [i][thing=50][/thing][/i].  You don't want to be the first person to place a village, because the other players can gain a tempo by blocking you, or else they get a leg up by budgeting their cards.  Going first is [i]not[/i] an advantage, which means the game plays better with less than six players so that everyone is equally penalized.

Each round starts out more tense due to playing for tempos, but can die quickly if the villages that get played are not aligned with the cards in your hand.  Other players can play villages in your "realm," destroying any synergy you were trying to meld.  There is also an undercurrent of knowing when to "shoot the moon," and try to visit all of the villages.  Gaining cards is an expensive but necessary investment, and you won't have enough of them to try every turn.  Replayability can be found by exploring these nuances.

The end result is a game that is both better, and worse than its progenitor.  I'll give it the same score, for now.

I haven't played Elfenlands so can't comment on the connection there. King of the Elves was pretty ok game, but it really dragged on forever and that was the most serious flaw of the game to me. With four players you had to wait forever until it was your turn again. Definetly too much downtime. Will probably not get played very much again, luckily I got it cheap.

Something seems off.  The game can really drag when someone changes the card layout late in a round (just before scoring).  This always happens, and it turns the game into a painfully slow "take that" fest.  After this war of attrition, luck (more than strategy) prevails.

This is a pretty fun game.  My one gripe is that river/lake cities are too hard to get to.  Each city should have more that one card that allows travel to it.  Two clouds should be able to visit lake town, and two of something else (Boar riders?) should be able to visit river town.

If this game plays as badly with more players as it does with two, then it really is very sucky. The problem is that I don't really dare experiment on other players out of fear they won't play with me any more. The reason: the annoying planning phase. Players are completely at the mercy of the cards they are dealt and cannot easily break themselves free from its yoke. Drawing extra cards costs you one card per draw; and you can purchase at most three new ones. These constraints, plus the amount of obstacles the other player(s?) will put up, see to it that Elfenkoning quickly becomes a grating experience, completely unlike the fluid nature of the boardgame original. You cannot really plan a good, worthwhile journey as you usually lack the cards to do so. The other player can thwart your journey by placing a village card you cannot pass because you lack the required travel card. Adding insult to injury, the examples given in the rulebook are quite theoretical in nature: I've never had a hand of 10 cards which added up [i]perfectly[/i] to the extent shown. All in all I wonder if this game was ever playtested. It certainly doesn't look like it.

I've never finished a game of Elfenkoning ever since I purchased the box as a gift for my girlfriend, but she refuses to let me sell off this piece of garbage claiming that we shouldn't break up the Elfenset.

RATING: 8.5
Contrary to other reviews I read, the two player version of this DOES work quite well I've found.  It's simply a matter of playing for four rounds rather than two (which is a bit scant).  Also, make sure each player uses suggested 3 villages-per-realm rule.  Unlike some players, I had no problem with the direction-changing card, but I agree that the gold cards should benefit both players (thus providing risk for its player) rather than being controller by one person.  Other than those modifications, KOTE is a clever, nice, fast card game with subtle strategy, but not enough to sink it into slow games.  I haven't had a problem with turn angst when drawing the 3 cards (like some have complained about), but I figure if someone is taking that long, they're prolly overthinking their turn. Still, great little game (with very nice art/components) for the price.  Thumbs up from me.

Components: Great artwork, typical of Matthäus. The side indexes for the terrain and transport types easy to recognize, despite a few similarities in color.

Experience: This game has its interesting moments, with players taking turns building the landscape and collecting cards that, when played in a particular order, will allow them to navigate that landscape. With more plays I might like it more.

RATING: 7
This is the card game version of Elfenland and shares the artwork with its board game cousin. We personally like the card game better as it provides a bit more variability and replayability to the game. In a five player game of Elfenland, we would consistly have two or three players get 20 points or visit all the cities. In King of the Elves, you can more deftly thwart that by combined efforts of a couple of players. This game is consistently fun for us and plays best with four or five. That makes it harder to get all the way around the board for the 10 point scoring bonus, a must if you want to win this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Nice mechanisms, nice artwork, but it takes a little too long to play with a lot of players. The game definately needs some adjustments to make it faster and reduce the downtime. Playing 4 rounds 2 player with a maximum of keeping 3 cards seems like the best configuration to me.

Faithful translation of the core of Elfenlands into a card game. Downsides are: 1) The luck of the card draw seems much more pronounced without chits to manage it. 2) Attempts to address point 1 via the 4:3 deal increase downtime 3) Haven't tried it, but I suspect sitting out a round to build killer hands could be a winner, but not fun. I'd rather play the board game, but with fast & loose players this could be an OK filler.

Rating after one play, but likely that will be it.  For sure I'll never play this with two players again.  Before drawing my first hand I saw a problem - what if I draw more villages than I can use?  Indeed, out of my first ten I got five, and out of the next eight I got six.  Good card games allow you to do things when you get bad cards.  Here the best option was to draw more cards (each time losing one from my hand, putting me at more of a disadvantage and losing the opportunity to do other things).  It felt like playing milles borne, hoping to get lucky enough to get just the card I needed.  UGH!

* Played 15+ times with 2-6 players for ?/5.0 hours.

AUG 2009: The more I play this game and understand the rules and strategy, the more I like it. It is almost a board game, but cheaper. Awesome cardplay tension and cunning player interaction. One of my favorite games. I like it almost as much as Elfenland. 2 player game needs variant fix, but with fix, it's great. Fantastic replayability. I sold this.

AUG 2013: Found used for a decent price. My enthusiasm has cooled for it a bit, but still a solid card game that belongs in the rotation because it offers a bit of boardgame feel. Wow! is it easy to get screwed on cards though.

Aug 2014: 7. 2p - Pales compared to board game, but still fun hand management game.

A superior version of Elfenland due to its portability; or putting it another way what Elfenland could have been had it not been for the board getting in the way.  It will take a lot longer to play than what it says on the box with more players; the only downside really.  It took us half an hour to finish one round - perhaps this will drop with more plays but I don't see it happening myself.

Interesting adaptation of the Elfenroads type game into a card game. Many of the same characteristics, but more transportable since small box and no map. Also, as I recall, this scales with number of players more easily than the board game. Still the right number seems to be 4 or 5 maybe. The challenge in the path is either easier with fewer players or harder with more players.

I thought this took way too long for the little fun I got out of it.  In the couple of games I've played, the start of each round was fairly automatic as everyone bought the maximum number of additional cards allowed, and then calculated their best plays based on the luck of the draw. Boring.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Much like Elfenland, it only takes one round of playing through to figure out how the game works and the subtle strategies involved.

Much like San Juan - an excellent card game version of the board game it is themed off of.

More plays I would anticipate will increase my rating.

**NOT SURE OF RATING YET** 

I need to see this more and suspect my rating will be influenced. Limited plays here, but it's easy to take with you and has the same basic feel of elfenland...Some say it's better, some worse. 

I think Elfenland is a bit easier for people to pick up on as the board game registers easier than the cards. This isn't a bad game; I just haven't firmed up my rating so take it with a grain of salt.

Impossible to get to all the cities with 5-6 players imo, and I haven't even played it yet.  An improvement on Elfenland, because there are more hazards and escorts and gold cards add distinct strategic elements to the game.

Not sure if I like this one, haven't played in some years. Will play again soon, and re-decide.

[UPDATE] Okay, so played this some recently to test it again. It's a little better now, after trying so hard to get into it and to like it. So bumping rating from 4.5 to 4.8 --> it still shouldn't require so much effort to like.

This cardgame is a derivation of Elfenroads/Elfenland/Elfengold, but plays much better than the original. 

The best improvement is that the board has become modular -- each round 'the board' is assembled from land cards (as part of the game).
Moreover, the scoring mechanism has become more fine-grained, which prevents those boring 20-(or 19)-points draws.

RATING: N/A
This game was one of the first games that I bought when I seriously started with this hobby. I bought it because I was interrested in Elfenland and this game appeared to be better for two players (I did not attend any gaming groups by then). Now a couple of years later I do own Elfenland, which is a very nice game and I do see no need to own this game as well. Due to the fact that in the beginning of the hobby I did buy a lot of games at once, this game even stayed unplayed all the time.

Fun and strategic once the following tweaks are implemented:

Plays like elfenland but with more flexibility (in that you can remove a village and replace it with another etc). I found elfenland was more limited in terms of catching a leader.

Good quality cards and counters as well.

A táblás játék kártyás verziója. A játékosok városokat játszanak ki maguk elé, akadályokat, vagy segítőket rendelhetnek hozzá városokhoz, és közben felkészülnek a nagy utazásra, amikor is különböző "közlekedési eszközöket" játszanak ki a kezükből és így próbálnak minél több várost sorban végigjárni. Minden meglátogatott városért pénzjutalom jár; a győztes a legtöbb aranyat összegyűjtő játékos lesz.

Much better than I was expecting, but we played with 6 and the downtime was a little too much.

RATING: 5
This game is all about planning your long move since once you're actually journeying you have very limited options available to make the trip safer or more productive.  Therefore, phase 2 of the game (plan your journey) is pretty much the whole game so there'll be a lot of thinking and groaning when your carefully laid out trip is ruined by an unforeseen new destination or thief, tree log, or sea serpent. With 2 players it goes pretty quickly but with 4 players there's a lot of downtime, and that's the bad part.

RATING: 4
After an hour of our first game, we had played just two rounds and gave up out of dis-interest. This game epitomises the sad counter-meaning of the phrase 'the best laid plans of mice and men'. Villages get played, you organise your cards to maximise your route and gold, then everyone changes their villages. Start again. You get hosed or you get lucky.

It would likely be better if:

1. you can eliminate the pre-conception that it is a travel game with the aim to make a circuit (an understandable pre-conception given this is the aim of all the Elfen ancestors). Its actually a gold game - the aim is to maximise your gold and minimise other's. Planting high-gold villages in your realm and putting a gold marker on them, together with a trouble marker, means who cares if you don't make a circuit.

2. Play with fewer players to reduce downtime and hosage.

3. Accept that it is linear (you travel clockwise or anti) and not 3 dimensional like the other Elfen games. This means there is no escape routes so play accordingly. Still, there's an awful amount of luck in the game - as to who gets escort cards, desired village cards, etc. Well, it is a card game I guess.

Why not follow the rule in Elfenland that you can thtow away any 3 cards as a joker?  The luck factor in pulling gold cards is too great.  House rules can be devised to overcome these issues.  I would also suggest a hand limit of 12 cards at the start of a round

RATING: 5
A card game version of Elfenland which I find too random and even has more scope for negative play. After the 1st round payouts, the next deals determine whether it's to increase your earnings or hit the leader. This then generates the humour of slapping back and forth, but with some competitors this will leave a negative vibe. Multiple options in a turn tries to address the randomness of the game, but some of the choices are time consuming and more so for the player(s) who continuely pass after their complete planning. The boardgame has a more streamlined game play.

RATING: 7
Everything to like that's to be found in Elfenland with the advantage of being quicker and more portable. The 2 player version plays too quickly in fact and would probably only rate a 7. Overall, an excellent card game. The main drawback is that the Planning stage can be quite slow as the Journey has to be entirely preplanned.

Played last night for the first time with six players. Easy game and rules that we tried to make more complicated i.e I kept repeating the mistake of trying to reverse direction in other's realms, which you can't do. seemed ok, could get a take that thing happening and should kind of balance out by trying to cripple the people in the lead. It took too long, although we were a tad retarded in our first game, and I think it would be best with 4 players.

A solid card translation of Elfenland (a superb game by the way).

The board has been replaced. There is a central deck of 120 cards that contains villages to visit, transport cards, obstacle cards and several other effect cards.

Players can get hosed by poor card draw and downtime can get long with more than 4 players.

[Amigo 'König der Elfen' 1999 Edition] {Fantasy Adventure, economic; drafting, hand management} King of the elves is the card game version of Elfenland but it's just a mediocre fantasy-themed family game. It's tactical but it involves quite much luck even though it allows drafting. It's better for fewer people if you want more control. If you want more interaction and fun, you can try it with more players but the 'Planning' phase will last quite long. The artwork of the cards is as beautiful of Elfenland.

Building village is not an easy task: 
1. Card draw moderately determines how one's village would look like and how far his can travel. It is somewhat balanced with buying cards and card re-draw. 
2. He has to guess which village his opponents cannot go. 
3. If he builds village short to get the full-trip bonus, others may be able to get it as well. But If he builds village long, he may not have enough cards to get the bonus. 

The "Gold"-"Change Direction"-"high-value village card" is a good combo to get high score. Better counter it quickly if you sense your opponent have both "Gold" and "Change Direction" cards.

My first question about this game is: Aren't players who are dealt lots of conveyance cards at a huge advantage over players whose hands are mucked up with a lot of village cards? Seems like this needs a fix where you would be drawing a set number of village cards separately from the other cards (yes, you can draw three cards and then discard four, but after doing that several times you're really behind compared with the folk who now hold far more cards than you do). I haven't seen much discussion of this fairly obvious flaw, but it's one that definitely detracts from my enjoyment of the game. In fact, the whole game feels like it needs little tweaks and fixes. The gold cards seem overpowered. And I understand that there are difference between the German and English rules to try to fix the card-hoarding strategy. All in all, while King of the Elves isn't bad, it's not good enough that I want to spend my time ironing out bugs that should have been squashed during playtesting.

Just not very satisfying, what meaningful decisions there are to make can easily be turned around by a bad card draw. I don't mind luck in games, but wqhen I do make a decision I want to feel that it has impacted the way I am going to play. About all the decisions in this game are gambles of some form. It's like playing ticket to ride wihtout the face up cards, without being able to see the board before you've already gathered a few cards... just not a whole lot of fun, there are so many better games out there.

And I wanted to like it too...

This game is harder to get as Elfenland, but not as hard as Elfenroads. Never saw it before in a shop, and suddenly it was there. Hidden between a lot of common games, a single copy of this game. Brand new, still in foil. As we didn’t own Elfenland, we believed that could be a nice replacement for it. At that moment, we didn’t know that less than 1 hour later, we would own a copy of Elfenland. That’s also the magic of Spiel. It is indeed a lot like Elfenland. Maybe a bit more tactical, because you don’t know what your opponent does. But also more luck involved in this one. Similar, but not as much fun as the game of the year 1998. You just miss the beautiful board.

When you play this one, with just two players, it’s becomes a great filler-game. You can play it in less then 15 minutes. Set-up time is about 2 minutes.

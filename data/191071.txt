RATING: 5.5
I played this game just once, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

A decent filler game that tries to combine trick-taking with dice rolling, but that is ultimately and unfortunately weighed down by a convoluted scoring rule-set. 

The components are nice, the idea is not bad... just the execution could have been better. As it is, it's barely alright.

A bit more luck than the cards version. Depending on group, mood and luck, that's better or worse ;-)

3-6 players? A dice game with betting and trick taking. Based on the Skull King card game. Dan King said this game is too random (/video/105737).

Makes a more beer and brezels like game out of the original. No strategy but more chaos which is quite nice if you have the right group.

Awesome trick-taking game, I loved it. I have played "Oh,Hell" many times and I liked it, but this one inherits the best parts from it and makes it so much better!

Reglas similares al Skull King de cartas, pero te la juegas al azar del dado.

Wizard (or another game of this kind) with dice. We played wizard too much (2-3 games each week) for several years, so I didn't mind a new take on it, but the dice make any planning obsolete even though it can lead to very fun moments. Opposed to Wizard it's not outstaying its welcome with fewer players at least.

Not as good as the card game, being more random, but at least there is no shuffling. A decent filler.

RATING: 6
A fun little luck based, trick taking dice game.
There's very little in the way of strategy in this game, but it can still be a lot of fun as you cheer the dice to go against people who've bid that they will win a lot of tricks. It's funny that it's possible for everyone to lose out in a round, with some people losing more than others. 

I can't see this as a game I'd buy, but it's certainly fun to dip into :)

white flags on powerful dice - this isn´t amusing

A nice filler, or a moderately complex party game.  Unfortunately, best will more people, so hard to get a good group for it.  Would have been better, in my opinion, with only one flag per "trump" dice (or at least most of them).

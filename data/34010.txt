Let me preface by saying I love Verne's work.  This is a fair set collection game.  There is not much replay value though.

RATING: N/A
Just from reading the rules it looks to be fairly thin on the decision side, i.e. choose a spot to earn a certain sort of card. Do players play against each other? It is clear that luck must rule the process of the game to make it event-driven; nevertheless it is difficult to see where the tactical choices come into play, Looking forward to reading a review of it!

RATING: 6
It's a luck fest, pure and simple......so I was quite surprised to see how much thought I put into my moves, especially in Phase One: weird! It is not at all a BAD game, at least for families. As for kids? The rules for Phases One and Two seem awfully fiddly for kids. Nevertheless, after playing it, I find myself feeling like I did when I was ten years old after playing a long game of Risk or Billionaire. Satisfied, but weary (it is a LONG game for what it offers!). Having said all that, the artwork is fabulous! It matters not whether you've read the novel (as I have): the whole theme and feel of the book is there in spades, but knowing the book doesn't really increase the enjoyment of the game. And the mechanics sometimes leave one wondering what exactly is the connection between mechanic and book: "Why do I need water from Hansbach to preserve the fossils that I've found.....which I'm not even going to be taking out of the earth in the first place???" It's also weird that the game IS faithful to the original novel....but has two additions to it from the 1959 movie! 
This is hard to explain, but in spite of all I just said, the theme is NOT pasted on at all! It just fits kinda strangely at times.

A family game that is much harder to teach than it should be. The game is divided into three segments; the second builds on the mechanics of the first and the third is a tense minigame all its own. Not for the hardcore, but a fun and gorgeous game nonetheless.

RATING: 3
As pointless as it is, Journey to the Center of the Earth simply runs by itself while trying to be «thematic»; that is, taking a very watered down inspiration from Verne’s novel: actually the theme here is as underdeveloped as playing a rope card to pass a whirl unscathed with a rafter can be.

Like most of the games boastfully taking pride in calling themselves «strategic», in this Journey you only have to play the right cards at the right moment, hoping nobody else does the same before yourself.

That’s the farthest your precious stategy stretches to in this boring game. [i](May 2012)[/i]

[b]Update[/b] - No reason to go light on this game: it’s bad, period. Thus, during my Fall 2015 rating revise I lowered my rating from 5 to 3.

Many similarities to Ticket to Ride, but nowhere near as good. Still, an entertaining family game provided players don't over think things, which can lead to a very long, drawn out game.

RATING: 5.5
A hand management and set collection game with a lot of luck... too much luck for me... it feels like the game is playing you.  It's an interesting exercise, but there is a certain amount of fun that is missing due to the large luck factor.  

I would prefer to limit the luck to the "fishing" for cards in the fossil deck.  My suggestion for a house rule is to give players more control over movement by having 2 or 3 face-up movement (red, yellow, blue) cards in addition to being able to draw randomly from the top of the movement card deck.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Definitely more of a family game than a gamers game - too long for what it is, first section is awful, and puts you off playing the game the first time, 2nd and 3rd bits are much much quicker.

A few less rocks on the first section and maybe a few less rows so it went quicker and I think you'd have a great game ... but as it stands a little disappointing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun light exploration game, replay value likely only moderate but easy enough for children and fun enough for grown ups.  Rules are clear and thematically sensible, the three phases play nicely though the final phase doesn't seem likely to affect the outcome much of the time

RATING: 5.5
Ok, so this is basically a family game, with some limited drafting and some random groping, kind of like Thebes.  I got it for the literary theme, and because I like Dorn's designs, and while this isn't my favorite game of his, it is good and solid.  The combo of competitive / cooperative play makes the game somewhat unique.  Nice and solid, with some nice components.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Really, really boring.  Draw a bunch of cards, make a move, draw a bunch more cards, make a move, draw a bun...ZZZZZZZZZZZ  Disappointing, because I usually like Dorn games, but this one is a complete miss for me.  I can't imagine playing this with my family; it is so boring the kids would never sit through it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The chatter on this one had been sort of negative, but I've got to remember there is a reason I never trust the chatter ...

This game generated the feel I like in a game: you're playing along in what seems like a fairly straightforward tactical game, and you realize as you go along that there is more to it than meets the eye. There is the tactical play of finding optimum moves, but there's also timing, and a little bit of risk management, and a little bit of evaluation. It's not a world beater, but it's clever and fun. It's probably a touch on the long side for what it is, and maybe not quite as thematic as it could have been (it's still decent), but it's still a very solid game.

This is probably more solidly in the category of a family game or a crossover game for non-hobbyist gamers, but there is still enough here to like for the hobbyist I think. I can't help comparing it to Ticket to Ride, a not completely dissimilar drafting/melding game, but Journey to the Center of the Earth is a much more robust, interesting, solidly put together effort that TtR, albeit the somewhat more constrained play probably leads to less replayability.

Anyway, I liked it; not awesome, but solid fun. Kosmos has quietly put together a fairly impressive line of these book-themed games. Lord of the Rings is the only one that's an over-the-top great game, but Journey to the Center of the Earth is a solid, reliable, professional line.

Various forms of set collection.  These are used for movement, earning things that earn veeps, and some of the fossils that grant veeps are collected into sets.  All players control the same explorer pieces resulting in an interesting mix of trying to do well yourself and yet screw the other guy.

Components: Gorgeous board; great looking cards; and even a raft for the explorers. This game looks great (and it looks more complicated than it actually is).

Experience: Mildly amusing. Several turns spent collecting cards (mostly randomly), followed by a movement spurt trying to get lucky with fossils. The game is deceptively divided into three phases, but the first phases is the longest and most important.

Beautiful game. Nice marriage of theme and mechanics. I like how the game captures the major events and plot of the book without feeling over-scripted. This game plays well with gamer-kids who can handle games like Castle Panic without help (8 to 9 years old?). Like Castle Panic, we play with all of our cards face-up on the table so that I can help the kids get the most out of their movement and tool cards. After a few games, they get the hang of it. Adults might like the added uncertainty of not knowing how the other players will change the board position.

Some farmer-types complain that this game is luck-driven; like that's a bad thing. I say that descending into the center of the earth, fighting thirst, antediluvian creatures, epic storms and riding a raft up an erupting volcano just isn't the thing for your average meeple. I say, if you make it out singed, but alive with a few rare fossils and crystals forgotten in your shirt pocket, you're doing ok.

A medium weight game that feels true to the feel of the novel. The game is played in 3 stages using card drafting and playing those cards. First, players move the adventurers "down" the cave collecting treasures and water stones. Then, the 2nd stage is the underground lake, where the adventurers are moved as a group (on the raft), again, collecting treasures. The last stage is moving on the raft "up" the volcano avoiding losing those treasures you've collected along the way.

I loved the Classics Illustrated and audiobook as a kid, so I caved (get it?) and bought this.  Kind of oversized (and overpriced) for what you get in the box.  The game is not bad, reminds me vaguely of Ticket to Ride in that you're alternating between collecting cards and playing them to claim things on the board.  But the card collection is more random (no face-up explorers to choose from, only equipment) and the reward for claiming things on the board is random too (if you draw three cards and you're lucky you get a skeleton worth 14, if you're unlucky you get three copies of the same half of a skull worth 0).  Still, I found it somewhat fun.

Fun whirl of a game.  I tend to like games that encapsulate books LotR, Beowulf, etc not as huge of a fan of games that come from video games.  Story games seem to capture adventure in a unique way.  It's not a gamer game it's a family game, and if family game is what yr looking for it's top notch.  Great art.  Dorn creates another fun one.

The game play fits the theme very well, as does the excellent artwork. There's more skill involved here than I initially thought, but it didn't become evident until a few plays. If the game has a fault, it's that it's a bit slow moving and it goes on longer than it should. My wife and I enjoy the fact that the game can be shortened by playing on the first (spelunking) segment. This is nice for when time is short.

Bought as a family game to play with my 6 year old daughter.  She loves fossils so this game was always going to go down well.
Unfortunately I find the mechanism a little simple for adults and slightly too complicated for her to compete, unaided, against adults (the box says 10+ !)

Great production and fits nicely into the Kosmos Literature series.

Not-so-simple-and-clear-as-it-appears card game by Rudiger Dorn. Maybe it's the translator's fault but I couldn't grasp the rules although it's a simple family game that takes about an hour. The graphics is fine, the mechanics as well, everything works OK. It just doesn't coonvince me as a whole.

This is really best as a family game with a couple of adults and kids in the age range of 8-16. I don't think I'll ever ask to play it outside of a family game night context but won't squawk too much about it if someone from our game group really wants to play it on game night.  It has an O.K. theme and isn't overly long so on the whole a playable game but nothing stnads out about it to make it unique or a classic.

Nice card management game, with a simple and fun system: the cards are used to dig fossile cards (the main victory point source), but can also be used to help you move a pawn on the board. And since the size of your hand is quite limited, you have to balance the playing and drawing of the cards all along.

Fun, agreable to play, but maybe a bit long for what it is.

My first experience with the game was decidedly lackluster, and I had no desire to play it again.  However, after receiving the Mayfair edition, I had to play it again in order to pen a review.  I'm happy I did, as I have come to really enjoy the game.  It is best in a family setting, and with gamers who are not seeking a long, strategy-laden game.

RATING: 8
Pretty good family game that may be spoiled by excessive randomness. I really enjoy the hand management, with the double use of equipment cards. The weakest point is the final phase, a card-flipping luck fest that may decide the game, and it does not even matter that players take turns. That phase is thankfully very short, but the game seems to take a bit too long for what it is. Excellent artwork and nice plastic miniatures, but I can't avoid thinking Germans have a lot to learn on what is "cool" regarding theme implementation. I mean, you base a game on Jules Verne's "Journey to the Center of the Earth", and the only dinosaurs we see are in ONE card?!

Light family game with lots of randomness. This game has a couple of rules that are necessary game wise, but don't fit theme wise: losing water drops to preserve fossils; always having to move at least one step forward; when first guy reaches raft all guys appear there, etc. Hand management mechanic is decent but fails to bring any tension to the game. It's just an one hour dull snooze fest adventure. There is a hand limit of 15 large cards, those 15 will be hard for children to hold. That is a pitty as I feel this is the target audience. Artwork is nicely done (Good job Franz) and the components are nicely done, especially the raft.

NOTE: the Dutch translation by 999 games has a serious error. It states you can have a maximum of 5 explorer and 10 equipment cards. 999 mixed up the explorer with the equipment hand limit in their Dutch translation. Boo!

RATING: 4
You play cards from the 1st deck to move, play cards from a 2nd deck to search so you can draw cards from a 3rd deck for points. Some turns, you may draw from a 4th "event deck" which will usually aid you in drawing from the first three decks. That's the game! It's not even as exciting as it sounds. The movement is heavily encumbered with obstacles that make you play additional cards, which you often don't have, so you spend many turns simply drawing. You'd think with such fanstastic subject matter, the artifacts would be equally fantastical in nature, not just fossils that can be matched for higher scoring combos. The card play is dull, the scoring pedantic, and the theme not evoked nearly to the point it should.

This felt like an ok family game. Theme is nice, but the playing is heavily dependent of luck. The first phase is a bit boring, because turtling is smart as you don't want to create opportunities  for other players to gather those fossils. On the other hand it's hard to plan your coming moves. The second phase is the best part of the game because you can actually try to plan a bit forward and everyone is literally in the same boat. The third phase is simply a stupid luckfest to end the game.

RATING: 5
Neeeeeem olyan nagyon rossz, de a jótól messze van. Igazából semmi baj nincs az alapmechanikával, azaz, hogy adott színű lapok lerakásával, meg némi tárgylap támogatással haladgatunk, fosszíliákat gyűjtögetünk, eseménykártyákat hajtunk végre. Semmi extra, de nem is problémás annyira. Az még érdekes is, hogy a 3 figurát együtt mozgatjuk, nincs saját színünk.
A baj inkább az, hogy bár 3 szakaszra van osztva a játék, igazából az 1. és 2. szakasz szinte teljesen ugyanaz, csak az utóbbi kicsit rövidebb, mert ott már egy hajóban van a három figura. Ehhez még az jön hozzá, hoz a 3. szakasz meg már csak arról szól, hogy vajon veszítünk-e a megszerzett kincseinkből, vagy sem.
Hát... Gyerekekkel néhány játékra jó lehet, mert az alapmechanika azért igényel némi gondolkodást, tervezést, és ezeket kicsit meg lehet tanulni a játék során. Mindemellett pedig nem csúnya. Egy próbát abszolút megér, de leginkább kevesebb fővel (2-3) és inkább fiatalabb társasággal.

Got this for free in an online contest, so at least I didn't throw money away this time!  The first few plays were rather enjoyable, though I always seemed to be the only one who liked it.  The first phase, with all the cards and playing of food and ropes and such, seemed to really baffle most gamers I played with, and it continued along to the second phase as well.  In the end, I just didn't think this would hit the table in the foreseeable future, so off it went.

This falls in with The Adventurers and Dungeon - my five-year-old daughter loves collecting treasures, and doesn't seem to care much if it's a silver chalice, a pile of gold, or, in the case of JttCotE (:)), a trilobite fossil.  Nice game with card management, some thought in best movement strategy, and a beautiful board.  Recommended with the kids - this one will see a lot of table time - but not with my gaming group.  Much like this comment, it probably goes on a bit too long for what it is too.

Very disappointing, especially since last year's [gameid=30239] was a decent family game. 

The first part of the game is quite interesting: It's all about hand management and timing. The second part is a letdown, mainly because the event cards add a huge amount of chaos in the mix. This means large swings in scores, and little possibilities for planning. The third part is an automatic and totally random coin toss where players lose VP cards depending on whether or not they have specific equipment cards in hand.

I had much trepidation about this game after having read varying comments. Although it may not have all the elements of the story that I'd want to see, I also don't want to downgrade it for not being exactly what I'd want in a game. 

Personally, even though the longer, middle portion of the game is kind of clunky, I like its old-fashioned feel of moving on a board, using cards instead of dice to activate movement. Obviously, card draw is random, but players must make careful judgments about where to move, when, to score points or pick up Event cards that may give them extra moves or cards, or other advantages. 

In Stage 2, when all players are together in a raft and take turns moving it, a player with a lead can try to move the raft toward the finish of that stage in order to protect a lead, while other players must attempt to pick up as many extra points as possible, and still try to retain enough Equipment cards to avoid losing Fossil (scoring) cards during the rapid ascent up the volcano to end the game. This second part is the main--longest--phase of the game, and unfortunately plays in a rather clunky fashion. 

Then the last part--exiting through the volcano--goes really fast. 

What I see in this game is a new spin on a traditional roll-and-move game, and on the whole I like it because the design emulates the feel of being on an adventure, moving from place to place, with obstacles along the way forcing quick decisions that determine victory or defeat--with a splash of luck thrown in. On the other hand, I wonder about play-testing--that maybe a lack thereof could have resulted in smoother game play.

The only question in my mind is how many times the game, with its somewhat limited scope, will remain interesting to play. In that regard, I'm guessing over time it will be the sort of game to take out on occasion yet still find enjoyable. On the other hand, I just can't picture getting several people together and keeping them interested enough in it to learn the game. 

Seems to me with a little more thought, this design could have become more streamlined to play, especially in the longer middle portion. 

After waiting 2-3 years, purchased new, on sale, December 2011.

Nice idea for a familygame
Quickly explained.
Good concept with the three stages. Takes a bit to get position and to get the idea an possibilities of the stones and so one can find.
Pretty Replayable.

So fun! A great medium weight game for families or just 2-player! Beautiful components, greatly represents the book and movie! Wonderful fresh game mechanics! At first the card combination's are a bit tricky to deal with, but once you get it the game moves along quite nicely! You are competing for the most points by game end, but it's almost...almost...a cooperative game! Your first game (especially in area 1) will seem to take forever, but play another game and it will move much quicker once you learn how to use the cards more quickly! A greatly under rated and super well designed family game! Absolutely love the fossil treasures you collect along the way!

A game turn is to pick up movement and/or equipment cards OR move. Hope that the previous players position the explorer that you have movement cards for in a nice place so you can move to a treasure spot with minimal expenditure, saving cards for later. Also hope to get lucky with the treasure cards you get (you want sets). The crux of the game is the tradeoff decisions you make on the equipment cards - spend them to reduce movement cost vs spend them to collect treasure. It's pleasant, but just not engaging enough to last you through the hour and then warrant replay.

Good looking game, like the art work. The play does relate well to the book. 

It is primarily set collection - explorers to move, equipment and finds for VP's. Nice balance between getting movement cards versus equipment cards 
There are 3 phases each take less time than the previous, and each is less important than the previous. The transition from the first to second phase is especially important since you don't want to be too thin when you get on the raft, you can get locked out of first wave of finds.

Enjoyable game which mostly involves playing card combinations to move forward on a board depicting events from the novel. The object of the game is to land on spaces that allow you to collect fossils. Players share control of three explorers that move independently. In the second and third phases, the explorer board a raft (nice how they attach securely) and move as one through an underground lake and out a volcanic eruption(!). There's nothing earth-shaking here, and the play gets a tad repetitive and goes on for maybe 10 minutes too long, but the illustrations are evocative and overall I'd say it's pretty fun, even if you're brain isn't smoking when it's over.

Light family Euro.  In some ways standard because it is an abstracted drafting/set collection/hand management game.  That said, optimizing the equipment is fun as these cards give you specific little powers, and the movement is entertaining.  Plus the "?" cards make for fun compound turns and strategies. 

This has a pool like quality where you don't want to leave the cueball anywhere with a good line for some one else.  The trick in this is that there are three cueballs in the beginning.  

Not a game to be taken too seriously, but it does what it sets out to do successfully.

It does a great job telling something close to the story.

Wonderfully thematic and I really like how no one is a particular adventurer, but instead, you all control the same set of adventurers.  Great idea with having three rounds that are each separate.  Unfortunately, it's just one of those games where the implementation falls flat.  There's not many interesting decisions here, and you spend much of the game hoping to draw cards that you need or want and being frustrated when you don't get them.

A light hand-management, set-collection race game. It's nothing remarkable, but it plays quickly enough and it is fun.

There are 3 explorer tokens (red, yellow, blue) and 2 types of cards: equipment and explorer (players start with equal number, same mix of cards; there are face up cards and face down draw decks). Explorer cards are used to move explorers (3 colors; 1 card = 1 movement pt for that color explorer) while equipment cards modify movement. The board has 3 areas: the descent through the mountain, the journey across the lake, and the exit through the volcano (~5 min only). In the first 2 parts, on your turn you either take 3 cards (any combination of face up/down explorer/equipment cards) OR move orthogonally; if moving, must advance (1 level deeper in mountain, 1 column further across in lake) at least 1 row/column. Each space costs 1 MP; some cost more (shown as 2 or 3 rocks). Equipment allows you to move diagonally, or get across pits/whirlpools, or make rock-spaces only cost 1 MP, or give you bonus MP. Moving over some spaces gives you a water token. If you end on specific spaces, you may discard a combination of 1-3 equipment cards (pictured on board) to draw as many fossil cards (lamp allows you to draw an extra fossil card to choose from). At the end of the Mountain part, you may keep 3 fossil cards for every water you discard. In the lake phase, all explorers are on 1 raft, so any single color may be used to move the entire raft. After moving and resolving lake space effects, draw a random event card (may hurt someone or give bonus VP if [un]able to discard specific combo of explorer cards). The player getting the first explorer to the end of the Mountain, or the raft to the end of the Lake, scores bonus 4 VP. In the final Volcano phase, draw random explorer card and move raft to next like-colored space; players must discard cards shown, or pay penalty. At the end, score VP = sum of values of fossils (various types, sets score higher if you have more parts of the set) + bonus VP + 1 VP/water token. Most VP wins!

Played this 2 player and it made us think just how adding more players were make it ever tighter and more competitive, and it was pretty tight with just the two. The game plays in 3 stages were the players control the 3-man exploration team (on a side note, it’s probably been 20 years since I have read the book and playing the game makes me want to read it again). My husband left the game with hard feelings since he felt ‘robbed’ during the last stage were poor planning left him with a less than ideal hand but he admits that now that he knows how the game plays, he would plan better and might feel differently. I personally liked the ‘narrative’ feel of the game and how the game’s different stages prevent the game from feeling too repetitive.

There's nothing terribly wrong with it, but it's a bit dull, and too long for the amount of randomness (or has too much randomness for the length, take your pick).

Straight up set collecting Euro that will appeal to both family and casual game play.  There's plenty going on to think about in the first phase in how to get your points and hose your opponents.  In phase two, things tend to become less strategic but you still have options on where to go when it's your turn.  By stage three the luck of the game (or game equalizer) enters play but can be mitigated somewhat by having the right cards.  The appeal to this one isn't number crunching to get the best score but more of enjoying journey married up to the novel while making some smart choices along the way and hoping for a bit of luck in the mix.

Although by its very nature, the game features much opportunistic play, the variety of cards you have keeps each player participating at a good frequency.  In the first stage, this is due to having three different characters you could move; in the second, due to being able to use any to move the raft.  The third is all about a little rough, random treasure loss, but it's quite fast, and thus a nice, thematic way to end the game suspensefully.  In both of the stages with movement by volition, the players have plenty of opportunity for lateral thinking.  A nice game!

Too many stacks. Too many rules exceptions. Too much needless nonsense. 

I want to love Paths of Glory, but it's in strong need of a streamlining redesign. It's 2015, you can't keep designing games like this.

Ask me again when I'm better at this...

Ok, have played it a few times now and...nice work! (I still suck at it though :P) Definitly one of the better CDG out there, but the length and the sometime unclear (even post-errata) rules probably prohibits it from become a number one for me (a spot reserved for Washington's War).

The cards add colour to the game and the game remains reasonably balanced throughout so even if you are behind you feel you can catch up.  Very clean mechanics. The only improvement i would like to see is some tweaks to make it easier to get the three VP spaces for the Tsar to take control and put the russians on the slippery slope to the Treat of Brest-Litovsk.

Learning how to play this now. So far it has been a lot of work just getting the rules down (not to mention all the exceptions to the rules). I will need to spend a lot more time with the game to be able to play proficiently, and right now that feels very daunting. This game just might be a bit too much for me at this stage.

EDIT: I finally feel that I have a decent understanding of the rules and basic strategic considerations. And I absolutely love the game. An extremely engaging and intense game that unfortunately requires a lot of patience while learning it.

I'm amazed how well the athmosphere of WW1 has been translated into a boardgame. From what I've read, WW1 was very static, yet the balance was a very delicate one. So in this part the designers have had an enormous success with PoG. 

When it comes to the gameplay itself, my initial game was fun and I enjoyed it, despite losing. However, I do not know how much fun it would be to live through those events over and over again when a single game can take up to 10 hours... I guess it will take quite a long time to find out because the chances to invest a whole day into a single game are very scarce.

RATING: 9
Fun and thought provoking game of WW1 at a strategic level. Many say its not historically accurate though. The optional rules in the Players' Guide fixes a few things to make it more historical.

RATING: 9
I like this game a lot, but I have a quite a few rule reservations about it.  Basically, I feel that it's a very good game that could have been a genuine classic top 5 ever wargame were it not for a few bad rules - which is a great shame.  This could have been the Hannibal of the 90s.  Bear with me whilst I have a rant first!

Whilst it now seems clear to me that the rules are not as impenetrable as they first appear, I still consider them to be overblown, occasionally irritating and at times just plain unclear.

I think that it's the scores of exceptions that cause the problem.  To my mind, it would be better if exceptions were flagged up as numbered footnotes and then placed below a line at the bottom of each page.  That way, you could first read the rules without the exceptions - and thus get the basics and then read them with the exceptions.  This would make them much more user friendly.  As they are, the rules as a whole are hardish, but they APPEAR monstrous!  The basics of the game are easy, but there are so many add-ons that it really makes it tough to learn.

A detailed example: I have fallen foul of rule 9.5.2.5 (yes there are that many sub-sections!). I based a whole turn's play on using The Italian Card as Replacement Points.  Everything I did was with that in mind, and then I found out that since my opponent was at Total War, I could only play the card as an event.  There are so many fiddly rules like that that a beginner can't remember them all!  In the event, I could have played a 4/4 card, as I did hold one, but then I would have more or less had to discard the Italian 5/5, which is practically worthless for the Allies at some points in the game.  Why not let the Allied player play the card ONLY ONCE as a 5/5 non-event play, or else play it as a 3/4 ops at any time.  I understand the historical point about Italy needing to enter the war, but the Allies lose VPs if they don't enter Italy after a certain point anyway.  That's should be enough.  As it is, this rule is a real nuisance for the Allies and the CP have much better 5/5 cards (esp if they win the race to Total War) in any case.  I can see it would be bad to let the Allies play the card as ops repeatedly, but as things are the rule works strongly for the CP.  In any case, this is an example of a fiddly rule that unnecessarily leaves a sour taste for one player. 

The rules for SR-ing to the NE Map maybe clear for those who know the game, but for those who don't they are a possible cause of confusion.  Why no mention anywhere about other Allies apart from the BR (inc Aus), making 13.2.1 very open to interpretation?  And I found the bit about the Canadians unclear, too, but don't get me started on that or I'll write another two paragraphs!

The rules on Retreat also allow a situation were a retreating (and probably badly mauled) enemy can move two spaces TOWARDS your lines in such a way that it can leave you being Out of Supply when it comes to his turn - which is plainly both historically ridiculous and leaving the game open to the most gamey of gamey moves.  In fact, Supply in general is rather over harsh in this game.

Folks who complain that this isn't an historical simulation are correct, but IT IS a game full of historical possibilities and I'd like to see that extended.  Two examples:

There is not enough chance for Naval actions to make a big impact on the game.  The present naval cards are a bit weedy, except for Blockade.  I'd give the cards the possibility for more VPs, and allow BOTH sides to have the chance to gain VPs in a Naval Victory by playing HSF/Grand Fleet. See my variant here:
http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geekforum.php3?action=viewthread&threadid=82630

As is, I don't think that the present cards reflect how Jutland, in particular, could have turned the war, and that for me is a BIG historical minus.  It was Churchill who rightly said that Jellicoe was "the only man on either side who could have lost the war in an afternoon," yet the game shows not a hint of that. 

That rule change for me seems de-rigueur, but, for die-hard naval-buffs, why not add a couple of cards?  For the CP, I think there could have been a "Battlecruisers Raid Scarborough" card.  A second British naval card (Battlecruiser Patrol) could combat that play.

Similarly, the tank cards look a bit weedy. If it wasn't for the cock-up of a reluctant and uninspired elderly British General of the old-infantry-school who wouldn't follow the tanks when they reached their objectives, the Battle of Cambrai could have swung the war dramatically - that it didn't wasn't due to tanks but to a old-fashioned cock-up.

Maybe something like these cards are in the extras that come with the Player's Guide. If not, I would consider adding them as extras.  This is a historical game, so why not add that truer flavour?

Anyway, despite my reservations, it's still a very good game and I'm sure that I will enjoy playing it many times in the future - especially on ACTS, where it's much easier to play than F2F.  The game is exciting and fun and a pretty good representation of WW1 (on land anyway). On the negative side it is hard to learn and the rules are at times inelegant and confusing.

You know, I'd probably edge this game towards a 10 were it not for those rule problems!

Probably after Hannibal and CombatCommander, this is the card driven wargame more often played by me. Very tense and stressful, unforgiving with the mistakes of players. Iconic in the world of wargames. 
2014 - After so many years playing it I bought it myself to study more careful the variant Victory conditions and the multiple paths to the victory. 
_____________ // ______________
2015 (Edit) A solid 8 as a Game.
 A CDG with lots of things around and lots of Game BUT A VERY POOR SIMULATION OF WW1.
There is no sense of Fronts so characteristic in this conflict.
Italy it's a shame! What's the historical reason for so many VPs in the Italian peninsula?!
Experienced players never put Italy in the war and Romania rarely has any role during play.
The CRT it's good representing the attrition battles of the War BUT the ability to join 6 or more Armies (XXXX) in an attack / offensive is highly unrealistic!!
Another thing annoying in the game is the Offensive rolls at the beginning of the turn. So artificial! After playing "The First World War" from the same designer (Phalanx) you have a more realistic feeling of WW1 and the need to attack and made offensives!
Ahh! and the mandatory offensives with a single depleted corps?! GAMEY!
Anyway POG it's a breathtaking and stressful exercise that feel good to return time to time. A favorite of my two playbuddies.
Lately, We only played POG with the historical setup variant.
A game of POG can vary greatly in duration: 1 to 9 hours!

Too many absurb situations in this game. The Middle East is made far too important in achieving victory.Also getting the United States involved in the war is rarely a goal the allies pursue. Any similarity between this game and The Great War is purely coincedental.

This game is tough, not rules wise, but gameplay. The more I play the more it looks to me that I'm really bad at it, which in return drives me to play it more.

As for the complaints that game is not historical, forget that. If I wanted to explore the history of WWI I would read a book about it, but in this game, each session gives a nice what if scenario.

Well deserved in its high rankings.

I really like PoG, but I get annoyed at 2 things: one is the numerous specific rules that shoehorn you into trying to do the historical thing rather than making the historical thing the obvious move because of the system. 
The second is the scripting: how often do the Russians capitulate and/or the Americans join?  I strung together the cards needed to get the British tanks and when I finally did it, I said, "Is that it?"

There are good ideas introduced here, but others ran with those ideas and improved on them.

Still, it is my go to WWI strategy game, so there is something to be said about that.

Card play trade offs are very gamey - do I take reinforcements or attack and so keep the card in the deck, or play the event on a particular card and so remove the card from the deck? Interesting trade-off, but gives the player too much control over the timing of events such minor powers entering the war and faces the player with choices very different from those that faced their historical counterparts. 

Ultimately a CDG with in this case a WW1 theme, albeit an intricate one, painted on. So a better game than a simulation, but impressive nonetheless.

Me pareci√≥ increible ver un juego sobre la primera guerra mundialtan tenso y divertido.
 En una segunda partida he visto que tiene un un problema del que no fuimos capaces de salir.
 El problema es que un jugador muy agresivo, con un ataque decidido, hace que todo sea vigilar las v√≠as de suministro y como cort√°rselas a los adversarios. No hay incentivos a jugar las cartas como eventos, como reemplazos o como otra cosa que no sea mover para rodear y desabastecer a la mayor cantidad de fichas contrarias. Las ventajas que provoca eliminar unidades desabastecidas (en vez de combatir contra ellas) es indudable, lo que te obliga a embarcarte en este baile mortal hasta que uno de los dos cae.
 Eso s√≠. Es entretenido, pero no es un juego que simula la I Guerra Mundial.

RATING: 4
This game for me has some major weaknesses: The supply - rules are a bad joke - a single Corps unit can kill 3 full strength armies by just cutting the supply lines. There is no breakout - attempt - nothing. The armies just sit there until the end of the turn then vanish into non-existence.

This is more a game of "move your units to certain places and win" covered in the mantle of WW1 - would work without a theme (this is not meant positive). They call it the "Dance of Death" - it is just an ongoing thing of trying to put the other units OOS - even without any fights - until one looses a 50-50 die-roll or can't move anymore.

Card-play is VERY scripted - especially for the Allied player who has not a lot of choices if he won't fall back w/o recovering. Especially the first hand for the Allied player decides an early demise. He has to go for Limited War (and therefore cripple himself on Replacements) or falls way back and gets crushed by a CP juggernaut. This is not "having decisions" as in a game like "Wilderness War".  

I can't understand what people like on this game - for me it is an absolute waste of time with a high frustration level for the Allied player. The games I observed did not even see Total War - they were done at least after 7 - 8 turns by a German Victory or an Allied player giving up frustrated.

    Update: Finished my next PoG game and lost again (Turn 1): CP played Guns of August, pressed hard on the front with constant attacks and, after taking Cambrai, put Verdun, Nancy and Belfort, with all of its armies OOS and therefore eliminated them since the French did not have the power to fight back.

I don't get this game - to me it looks totally unbalanced. In a strategy guide I read that a French Player should instantly attack Strasbourg from Nancy. The French have an attack of 6, the CP a 5 Army plus a 3 fortress. Even if the French succeeds, and the CP withdraws, moving one army into Strasbourg leaves Nancy wide open?! 

Final thoughts: After five consecutive plays I have to say that this game is not for me. The most annoying thing for me is that the game "works" on the base of "lack of concentration" on one players side. One short moment of not 100 % in the game lets you miss the move of a small Corps that puts your armies OOS. Its like chess where you wait for your opponent to just let his concentration slip for a moment. 

Also the gameplay looks to me a bit like chess: Opening moves draw certain responses. 

And another problem: A lot of the die-rolls are 50/50 rolls that let you either win or loose whole fronts. In no other game that I played was victory so dependent on a certain roll. And this gives a roll IMHO too much of an importance - taking away from overall strategic decisions.

Finally:

It is more a game than a simulation with a not-needed  WW1 theme  - and that is its major fault.

One of the best wargames out there! If I had to say a negative it would be that it lasts a bit too long but it's such a great game that it deserves the time invested. I love the 55 card deck that each side has (I also love when cards are added according to the war level) and the whole deck management along with the strategic options is probably what makes the game that awesome. Even if you play one of the shorter scenarios it's a very much worth it. If you like CDGs I think this is one of the greatest designs but I believe every board game player that likes heavier games has to give this a try sometime!

Ok, it's fun and full of tense, but many things about ITALIA are wrong:
MAP: there isn't connection between Milano-Bologna-Ravenna while this was one of the most important road since roman times. Asiago should be mountain space (many alpine battles where fought there). Venezia should be "swamp" since many rivers cross the plain around there. Maggiore should be a "corps only" space.
UNITS: are underrated at least for the defence
CONDITIONS: Italian army had many deficiences in heavy weapons when entered war, but was immediately able to launch many and bloody offensives and this along all the war, so units should start at full state and replacement points should be more.
POLITICS: NO foreign armies (of both alliances) should enter Italia for political reasons.
OVERALL CONSIDERATION: Italia proved herself a RESOURCE not a DEBT for the Allies; was a situation quite different from WWII: Italian engines were sold Worldwide, Italian troops were sent in France and Balkans...
VICTORY: real italian weakness was political and emotional, so Italia would be out of war if Milano or Bologna were conquered by Austrians.
Playing with the standard rules means Italia out of the game in a couple of turns if you have a clever/expert CP player; the strategic situation on other fronts is irrelevant: nothing can save italian units from destruction immediately after war declaration and is impossible to recreate them with a replacement rate so low. Thumb down for Italian front.

The best card driven wargame, in my opinion, when compared to the others that I know (Twilight Struggle, Washington's War, For the People, Barbarossa to Berlin, Empire of the Sun, Hannibal, Wilderness War and a few others). Rivals with For the People for the first spot.

Very immersive and tense. Extremely tough decisions when deciding which front deserves the scarce resources that come with each card played.

My only complaints are:

1) the intrincate rules about what countries can and cannot do in the middle east. I'm not sure it adds that much to a design that was already fantastic, but gives the perception to some of my friends that the whole game is complicated, when in reality it's not. But, to me, these mid east exceptions and fiddleness are nothing that a good player aid cannot solve. I just wish I didn't need it.

2) the harsh supply rules. In our group, we play with Barbarossa to Berlin's rule, where you check supply after YOU play your last card and not after THE LAST PLAYER plays his last card. It makes a whole lot of difference, making the game much less "gamey", without screwing up the balance.
Great design. A shame that it doesn't hit the table more often.

Buen juego. Uno de los padres de todos los CDG que han surgido despu√©s.
Tenso y entretenido, aunque me parece mucho m√°s complejo jugando con las Potencias Centrales que desde luego no llegan a todo con los ej√©rcitos que gestionan.
Gran reto en el control del timing de las diferentes fases de guerra y la entrada de neutrales. Una de las partes m√°s interesantes a mi gusto.

Su peor parte, sin duda, es lo cuidadoso que hay que ser con el tema del suministro. En especial con las Potencias Centrales debido al orden de turno y a la baja densidad de counters en algunos sectores (no tienen para todo). Un descuido puntual, a final del turno, implica la p√©rdida definitiva del ej√©rcito (o ej√©rcitos) y pr√°cticamente el final de la partida. Esto da lugar a una guerra mucho m√°s m√≥vil que la que aconteci√≥ hist√≥ricamente, con alguna situaci√≥n un poco irreal.
Este tema me pareci√≥ mucho mejor implementado en el WWII: BtB (del mismo autor y muy similar en sus mec√°nicas) ya que la mec√°nica del suministro es menos implacable. Y en cualquier caso, los embolsamientos son en este caso un acercamiento m√°s hist√≥rico por el conflicto que trata (una guerra m√°s m√≥vil, sin duda).

Me gusta el juego, pero el tema del suministro me parece demoledor y bastante anticlim√°tico porque al menos al principio much√≠simas partidas terminan por embolsamientos y eliminaci√≥n, lo cu√°l a mi particularmente no me resulta especialmente divertido (da igual si gano o pierdo con ello).

The western front is not always so quiet.  There are few games that capture a particular feel as well as PoG.  In the wave upon wave of fruitless attacks and the back and forth lines from advances and retreats, this game does a remarkable job capturing the hopelessness of the First World War.  The game's components are not great (a hard-mounted board and larger chits would be nicer and give the game a bit of a face-lift), but that should not deter the serious history fan from diving into this game.  The biggest detraction of the game is the play time.  Overall a solid war game that is playable but long, very long.  [GTI: TPSD]

The game lives up to the hype. Great overview of WW1 with lots of manuever in the East and Middle East and Gridlock in the West. Has a 3 turn tourney variant which is also a good taster for the full game. VASSAL module + Skype.

RATING: 8
The granddaddy of heavier war CDGs. Although the game usually develops along very unhistorical lines, the cards help give it a lot of a flavour. Very unforgiving supply rules make for potentially unstable situations that demand plenty of attention, but generally the strategy feels right, and the progression through the war decks to limited and total war is a great idea. It also suffers less from the different front problem than its WWII counterpart, Barbarossa to Berlin, though the Mid East seems at best a side show. 

I think the only major flaw is that there aren't enough mechanics in the game to reward progression along more historical lines in some rather crucial events (Italy, US, Russian revolution...) A great game, unfortunately slightly too long to play comfortably in an evening.

I really like everything about this game except for the rules. Not only are the exceptions a little too much, the regular rules just can't seem to stay in my memory. Maybe its the map or the counters or something, but if someone put a gun to my head and asked, for example:

"Can one of your units move through a besieged enemy fort?"

I would have to say "Let me check the manual".

RATING: 9
Solid, tense and well balanced. The handling of the cards is arguably better here than in any other game I've played. Nearly every decision requires careful thought and it is painful to give up alternatives. Initiative is key, one wants his opponent to be in the position of reacting as much as possible and the tension between playing for ops, events or rp's makes hand management and tough choices the name of the game. Its weaknesses (as stated below) are relatively minor considering how good this game can be.

Suffers from front fixation where players get drawn into spending all their cards activating forces on one front while ignoring other fronts for long periods of time. Can be somewhat gamey.

I definitely see where Twilight Struggle came from.

This game is much more direct conflict than Twilight Struggle (gee, I wonder why) - and Twilight Struggle is certainly more streamlined, but I do feel like I'll need to log 5-6 plays on Paths of Glory before I really understand some of the nuance and strategies.

In my first game, the near east board hardly game into play. I'm sure that's probably an example of one of us completely dropping the ball on tactics.

This is an initial rating based on a couple PBEM games (neither of which were really played to their conclusion).  Still...the small taste I had of this one left me hungry for more.  Between managing your decks (trying to bring more of your cards into the game), resupplying your armies, bringing new armies into the field, and managing multiple fronts, this game has plenty of tension and tons of interesting decisions.  Can't wait to play it again.

Update:  This game RULES.  One of my favorites when I'm in the mood for a longer more in depth experience.  There's also PLENTY of info and variants that give this game even more historical authenticity.  Well worth your time.

The only reason this isnt ranked higher is play time.

So this is the famous Path of Glory! I'm already not liking seeing the Central Power card backs showing Allied soldiers! Oh well, I will enjoy learning and mastering this game.After reading through the rules and feeling overwhelmed, played the introductory scenario. Five hours later I have a basic understanding of the game and looking forward to trying different strategies. Its nice that in the intro scenario you don't have to deal with the many exceptions to rules in PoG that are difficult to remember. It feels like it will take some time before I get tired of just playing the Intro and learning the basics, almost like a 9x9 game of go. Your mistakes became apparent quickly and a restart is easy.

A solid treatment of WWI at the strategic level, works well, plays well although the number of rules exceptions and specificities makes it daunting at times.

It helps to know the decks well in order to make enlightened decisions, like for most CDG.

Supply rules are tricky to manage but once you have understood them well and understood the map structure, its ok.

Addition after several more plays:

Game takes at least 8 hours to completion. Ends before USA enters war. There's a lot of emphasis on action in Turkey, Romania, Bulgaria, Balkans... too much perhaps.

Downgraded. Why?
Doesn't feel like simulating WW1. Guns of August gives me more this trench fighting feeling.
But of course no one tried to game GOA as a full campaign game (60 hours playing time). 
Paths of Glory is perhaps a better game but it misses on simulation.

RATING: 9.5
Just now getting into this game with the recent reprint. I have played both the vanilla game and (presently) the WBC 2013 historical variant. I am nowhere near the point where I know the cohesive flow of the game or the strategic possibilities...yet, I have played this game enough (some learning games with an equally new opponent) to consider rating this high.

The design is brilliant of course, but what I did not expect (based on all the word of mouth to the contrary) was how much this "feels" like World War I. No, it won't likely play out like the Great War and I am sure there are plenty of "gamey" tactics that I have yet to realize...but the system gives me the feel of the conflict, and that is pretty grand. As someone who likes the history to be a part of the hobby, this (so far) gets a thumbs up from me. Admittedly, this is the only WWI game I have played, but I can't wait to explore this more.

Side note - this is probably one of the greatest examples in the CDG genre that I have played, that employs that "so much to do, so few options" feel as limited by your hand of cards. A very tense and fun experience overall.

(UPDATE - 10/5/16)

Finally getting back to this game via some play time that includes the latest BPA PBEM Tournament. This game has me hooked, and I have no choice but to update my rating to a 9.5 (my first "half point" grade on BGG). I have been studying strategies and the game is deeper than I ever gave it credit for. I can see indeed why this game is famous. Of the CDGs that I have played, this one seems to have the greatest tension of all, and that is the greatest compliment I can give it at this time.

An excellent and enjoyable game. I like the puzzle that is what order to play your cards as well as what manner. It is also very easy to PBeM. In fact, I have never played this game ftf.

HOWEVER, this game is not history. Because it is so scripted, it can easily veer off into absurdity. For example, the Russians could be steam-rolling the Austro-Hungarians, but because the Allied player needs to get to Total War, he'll play The Great Retreat even though he knows he'll not be retreating even one space in the forseeable future.

Ah, but it is such a great game.

If a game is measured by the quality of its decision-making then Paths of Glory is at the top of the heap. Every decision is agonizing, and I can't give a game higher praise than that. There's a good sense of tactical play with the multiple activation system, and the multiple fronts almost make this feel like a game of resource and hand management. The system is solid and elegant with only moderate complexity by wargame standards. It's easy enough to see that you're attacking on one major front and defending on the other, which makes the game amazingly accessible. Playing time is long but not unreasonable, and unlike many wargames Paths of Glory does justify the length by remaining engaging and unrepetetive the entire time. That's the strength of the card driven games, really. They're like wargames for the CCG crowd. If Paths of Glory has one major flaw it's that the game is fragile. One bad move can literally cost you the game due to supply lines, and that's quite unsatisfying. I wouldn't even think of playing in a tournament. In a casual setting this shouldn't be a huge problem, but be aware that this is the definition of unforgiving. Apparently some people have historical beefs with the game, but I couldn't care less. I care about gameplay, and in that category Paths of Glory is a perfect ten.

Rating downgrade, Dec '15, from 10 to 9.  After 16 solos and 1 pbem of this game, I realize I have exactly ONE Ger outcome where the Czar gets toppled and the Russ collapse.  This, after repeatedly breaking my gaming back with grossly exaggerated emphasis on Ger making it happen in the East.  I've had a lot of fun with this game, but the epiphany finally came that it is seriously out of whack regarding Ger/Russ dynamics.  It is just too flipping hard for the Ger to make headway unless they roll dr6 on every combat, and get 4-5 ops cards all over the place.  And if they play all these cards for ops, the WS never gets to the magic 33, eh?  Sorry, the WTF? light bulb finally came on over my head about this.      

Some loose joints regarding the history, but I think this is the most enjoyable example of what a CDG can bring at a strategic level.  The history definitely takes a backseat, but it's still in the car, and I've had a lot of wild rides with this thing.  Nicely done.

Not many games leave me dreaming about how to play better the next time. This one does that in spades. As a historical simulation it can be legitimately critisied for some ahistoric elements but as a game it has few peers in the excruciating choices when deciding between ops/event/replacements at key moments.
Because of the draconian supply rules games are often very tight until someone manages a OOS coup at which point games ofter swiftly collapse to a clear win.

Fans of the Great War will likely revel in this. Fans of card-driven games may wonder if the whole glorious package could have been scaled back a bit. New players should expect to play an average of about 1-1.5 turns per hour. Veterans may whittle this to about two turns per hour. Overall, you feel like you're an impulse behind the power curve in managing the various fronts‚Äîwhich is probably just about right for a good CDG. And the escalation of the war over the passage of the turns makes the going tougher. Overall, a fantastic accomplishment, but the immense investment in time will restrict plays to devotees of the war and the system.

A breakthrough game that spawned a subgenre of CDGs: Barbarossa to Berlin, Pursuit of Glory, Triumph of Chaos, and Shifting Sands all use card play, movement, and attack rules that relate directly to POG.

The game is a multi-front struggle that produces a tension that is unique for me in gaming.  It's intense, but at the same time, enjoyable, because the game is so interesting.  At the end of the game, you feel like you've been through a war, but man, that was good!  The tension might not be for everyone; the game can be very unforgiving.

Excellent CDG treatment of WWI (The Great War). More of a wargame than many of its CDG predecessors, it still maintains the amazing tension of card management unique to the genre. The cards support the theme admirably, as does the play, yet the game still manages to have a sense of flow and development in its treatment of what was in actuality an enormously static human meat-grinder. The action can swing from theatre to theatre and the combat engine is better than most for this type of game.

The only negative is that this game is extremely long to finish in one session for most gamers. The "introductory" scenario can be played in a reasonable time frame but players will likely feel like the game has only just started to get interesting. The next scenario is a large leap timewise and the campaign game is of epic proportion (much like "For the People). Still, for those with the stamina, this game will satisfy...

I have a serious issue with the supply rules in this game. Both games I played up to now where prematurely terminated after a lone corps isolated (and thereby killed) a bunch of armies. Ofcourse this will be no real problem for experianced players, but for beginners this is a serious issue. I do understand that this is supposed to force players to behave historically, but dealing out that much potentoal punishment for a minor mistake seems nasty in a long game.
Some day a will try this game again, because everything else seems fun. I hope that then both players (but especially the central powers, not beeing allowed to move before the final supply check) will be sufficiently paranoid to avoid beeing put out of suply.

A CDG that showcases WWI.  After the opening flurry on the Western Front this meaty game settles into a scenic drive through the political events and arenas of early 20th century combat.  

My first play was a very methodical game of back n forth through Belgium and Western Russia and Poland.  It was a a sort of fun like having a warm shower not intense in anyway but refreshing and you feel much better afterwards.  We played though the limited war with the allies fairly easily scoring the better points by having gain ground through blockade the event and by gettin Southern Germany unsettled.  Too many reinforcement events by the allies spead thin my limited forces on the CP side.

Love this game.

One play - Limited War Scenario. This has gotten me back into wargaming. Really enjoyed this tense conflict. I would like to rate it higher, but the Allies seem to have the edge, though it does not seem too big. Trying to grind down the French on the Western front is a sight to behold, reflecting well upon the notorious trench warfare that is characteristic of that great war. A very rewarding experience if you have the time.

RATING: 8.5
Difficult to rate the game as none of my sessions have made it out of 1914 as of yet. LOL! 

What I do know is that there is lots of tension and each card play tends to be agony. This is due, in large part, to the relatively small number of cards plays per turn (6) which is found in similar games such as B2B and "Shifting Sands". Lots of exceptions though that would require regular play to become used to. 

Prior to playng I had slotted this as a step up in complexity from SS and I believe I was justified in that assumption.

RATING: 10
Every card play presents an agony of options: too many things to do, and not enough time (or power) to do them all. The wealth of tough choices presented by this game makes it a '10' in my eyes, even if it isn't always a perfect WWI simulation.

I've knocked down my rating a touch in the last year as age has caught up with Paths of Glory to some degree. Now, don't get me wrong, this is still an excellent game, one of the best wargames in the past 10 years - but it doesn't seem to quite go "over the top". Part of this is that the wierd trade-offs (why is Russian and French activity mutually exclusive? Didn't they usually try to coordinate their efforts?) often make play often feel more like Princes of Florence than Hannibal or Grant Takes Command or Breakout: Normandy (just to pick some other rather abstract, but still highly successful, wargames). Holes in the game have also openend up; it works brilliantly when the situation follows broadly historical lines, but shudders rather badly (from both a game and historical viewpoint) when historically implausible strategies are persued. The major problems are two: firstly, the unrealistically high VP value and vulnerability of Italy, to the point that the game revolves around it to an unhealthy degree; secondly, the Russian Capitulation Sequence doesn't work because of the near-impossibility of getting the Limited War cards in the sequence into play while still getting to Total War in a timely manner. Another non-trivial weakness in the game seems to be the portrayal of tanks; arguably the war-winning technology gets entirely short shrift with only one incredibly limited card, while the admittedly important but less successful Stoss offensives get what, some 4 much more powerful cards? Cards with very few restrictions? These design decisions seems to distort things to the degree that you often get wacky, ahistorical results when players start to game the system (and let's not forget, "gaming the system" is something we should expect players to do, since that's what playing a game is). Finally, PoG doesn't seem quite "dense" enough for the full campaign; that is to say that like virtually every Raicer "big" game I've played, it's somewhere between somewhat and much too long for what it is.

As a random comment, although I resisted it for some time, I've come to accept that the full optional setup in the rulebook should be used, and the 8-card hand is probably highly desirable as well. The strength of the game is such that even with these problems, PoG is still an excellent, top-tier type game, which should tell you somthing. It just seems to miss by a bit the "enduring classic" status it might have achieved. All in all, a fine game, but several leagues short of Hannibal in terms of replayability, narrative, and design robustness. It makes me wish for a new edition that takes a fresh look at the design with the benefit of hindsight. 

While Barbarossa to Berlin has some issues, including a ludicrous amount of eratta (update: not an issue anymore with the reprints), I think it's the more solid and more interesting fundamental game. It didn't get the same "wow" factor as PoG, since it was a follow-on game and doesn't have quite the same really sharp hooks that PoG did. But it is much more robust, and more tactically interesting.

a very good game and design, but it does fall short in terms of simulating the war.  OOS effects in the attrition phase is absolutely punishing.  i wish it didn't abstract the naval impact so much but it captures the tension on the fronts pretty well.  The mechanics work well for competitive and solo play (from my limited solo experience).

RATING: 6
This is my rating after my first play. The game is too stodgy - like a bowl of porridge which was let to boil over in the fire. In the beginning of the game, the limited movements in the Western Front is realistic, but boring. While at the Russian front, the Russians can get early advantage as can the allies do in the Far East. There are too many 'fronts' in this game which would inadvertently overwhelm the player, even if he is experienced. At about midway into the game, I could not help feeling that whatever actions I did had very little impact on the overall game because what I could do in one round or turn can be undone very easily by the opposing player in the next round or turn.

This game is overrated. I don't know why it is overrated though, but I prefer Shifting Sands, which is a more fluid game and not as tedious.

OK. I've come late to the party, but what's the fuss about? So over-analysed now that the game seems to have driven out the history (what the hell's going on with the Italian and Turkish fronts anyhow? Did the Germans and Austrians really give a monkeys about what happened to Turkey?) The apparent need to manage one's cards carefully (mustn't play these events lest one end up with hands full of 2 and 3 Ops cards at the end) irritates me as well.

Much prefer the leader-oriented CDGs like Wilderness War or Wellington.

This is right on the cusp of what I can handle in gaming rules, but it certainly is an amazing experience.  Makes me want to learn more about the Great War.  Also helps that the highly regarded Triumph of Chaos uses a similar system.  As I said, all of the exceptions are keeping this from a ten and that's really my only gripe.  I think that's the nature of the beast, though.  Still, I think the effort will pay off.  I came to this after War of the Ring, Hannibal, and Wilderness War.  I would certainly recommend starting with any of those before jumping to this one.

UPDATE: After more playings, the exceptions hell does creep up a bit, to make it tough to handle.  But, this game just oozes tension.  It's the best wargame I've ever played, and I would play it pretty much anytime.  Which says something considering how long it is.  I can also understand the critics who find it a-historical, but that element just doesn't bother me much.  I'm still amazed at the number of elements that must be juggled and considered to play this game at a high level.  It certainly rewards repeat plays!

Three reasons for which I like this game:
1. Strong historical script with lots "what if" without going SF. Gradual escalation of conflict with more fronts to care, almost all of them cannot be ignore.
2. Climate - very good feelling of participating in WWI strategical decision making. On which front I have to defend? Where should I attack? Where and when I want use my reinforcements? What would do my opponent?
3. Elegant mechanics - lots of exceptions, but after one play all is easy to understand. Most favourite - Loss Factor use in Combat resolution and Supply rules - it is never possible to forget about them.
Great Great War game.

I generally do not like Card Driven Games, because you have to know all of the cards and, from a strategic point of view (and under a victory perspective) the playing of cards is more important than the maneuvering of units. Anyway I do not manage to play it so many times as I would like to (ten plays till now, more or less). But it's a real challenge to play. If I played it the right numbers of times, probably it would deserve a better mark than the one I'm giving here.

I am a big fan of the card-driven scheme for a wargame. My introduction to the genre was Barbarossa to Berlin, also by Ted Raicer. It seems like the general sentiment is that Paths of Glory is the better game....but I suspect there may be some bias toward whichever game people played first. I like both games quite a bit, but am more familiar with the history of WWII. 

Make no mistake, the learning curves are a bit steep and have a few facets. Firstly, there is a sizable rules curve, with a healthy amount of exceptions to rules which are needed for the historicity. With Barbarossa to Berlin, most of those seemed fairly intuitive once I learned them, because I could connect it with a historical concept. With Paths of Glory, I've had a little harder time but not too bad.

Once the rules are mastered, there is strategy to learn in terms of understanding the vulnerabilities of the initial set-up and the idiocyncracies of the map. You need to see where your forces are vulnerable and how to apply effective pressure to the opponent. Its not always immediately obvious what the best moves are to obtain much-needed VPs. 

Finally, with a few playings, the decks are learned. There is quite a bit of timing to catch a sense for. When to play certain events....how fast the decks cycle...when Limited War and Total War will occur, what cards specifically are in each player's sub-decks. Once the decks are familiar, I think the fullest strategic decision-making becomes available. That's where Raicer's CDG shine. The investment is probably higher than a lot of people are willing to make. The game has a lengthy play-time. This is not an introductory wargame. But if you're interested in paying that price, you're in for a delightful treat. 

I've had problems finding dedicated opponents some of the time, but the online interface is good and can be very enjoyable. Face to face, this is a blast to play and flows nicely. 

Update: After a half dozen playings I only want to play more. New strategies keep suggesting themselves. I also appreciate that the game is simply harder for the CP player to do well. I like this game more, the more I play it.

Update. This one is a 10. It won't keep me from wanting to play more...but I wish it was evenly balanced between the CP/AP win outcomes. I recognize that the Allies did win the historical battle, but the game would be better if the CP could win more their share closer to 50%. Maybe its more my limitation in how I play them, but the fact that people tend to bid a couple VPs for the Allies argues against that.  All that said, its still a 10 for me.

Update: My preference is to use 3 optional rules. 1) Alternate corps set up (per the rulebook).  2) Failed entrenchment bonus (per rulebook).  3) CP gains a VP for going to LW and TW, which just about equals the common bidding of VPs in tournament play, yet instead works the VPs into the fabric of the game itself. Maybe its a trivial difference to most, but it feels more elegant to me.

RATING: 8
This is an excellent game.

You have several things you feel you must do every play, but can only accomplish a few of them.  The balance of reinforcements, movement & attacking, getting important events to occur, etc. has to be weighed carefully.  

The game feels like one of those plate spinning acts, ignore one aspect for too long and the whole thing starts to wobble then crash.  The meantime you are frantic trying to keep everything functioning on every front.

The only thing that frustrates me are the severe supply rules.  If you are not careful to close any tricky movement paths the enemy can exploit (which i never am), you will pay dearly.

This is an amazing game however, lots of fun!

Playing PoG reminded me yet again of how much the gaming hobby has lost by shifting more toward "family" games and the European designs.  This is a game that requires patience, commitment, and learning- it's definitely not the junk food/casual sex that the German games are analogous to.  PoG is hampered only by an apparent inaccessibility (rules exceptions, copious chrome and details) which is unfortunate because at its heart this is a fairly easy game- mainly because the rules are logical, straightforward, and grounded in the historical theme.  As far as historicity goes, I don't think Mr. Racier wanted to recreate the exact situations in the conflict so much as capture the sweep and sense of WWI- complaining about how exactly it depicts the war is sort of a silly argument.  This is one of the best wargames I've ever played, and it's one I'll definitely be exploring more in years to come.  I've recently downgraded my rating by 2 points- I do think that the length and complexity severely limits its playability and frequency.  Granted, I think the scope and scale of the game calls for a certain level of complexity but (here it comes)I think Twilight Struggle has really rewritten the rules so to speak on what we can expect from a CDWG- breaking it down into basic elements, I don't think there's anything that PoG has to offer that TS doesn't in a much more efficient, streamlined package.  That being said, PoG is much more of a traditional wargame and it's one of the finest of that genre.

Long game, dude.  Worth every second.  First solo session was around twelve hours.  Allies lost in the vicinity of turn nine.  Probably a six or seven hour game to go the full twenty turns after you've played two or three times.  Six actions per turn to cover all of Europe ... tough decisions.  Actually, that's the best part of the game - the multitude of important decisions to make during every round.  Lots of exceptions in the rulebook, although the base ruleset is simple.

February 2008 - got to play face to face.  Way good.  Almost six hours for ten turns.  Twice as fast next game I hope.  
March 2008 - second face to face game.  Six hours until an autovictory on turn eleven or so.  So, not twice as fast yet ...

January 2011 - relearning PoG, and there are more exceptions than I remember.  Guess I'll just miss a few (dozen) next time I play.

P500'd the Deluxe (sixth) Edition. Guessing 2019 delivery. $49 + $19 shipping.

I've been playing war board games for over 30 years.  PoG is a fantastic war game.  The amount of counters is not enormous like a lot of rich strategy war games and the rules are not overly complex.  The card driven element adds so much fun and variety versus the traditional hex games.

The best operational/strategic card-driven wargame (WWI). Very complex, epic, high replayability. Very long gameplay, around 8 hours of big tension. Huge [u]depth[/u], increased by the operational level, lots of options available. Tough decisions because every time there are always a lot of different things you need to do and each card has many different uses.
Excellent components in Deluxe Edition.
Suitable for [color=red]solitaire[/color] games (just try to make decisions without remembering what the other side had in its hand).

Another GMT game that hits the sweet spot. Just enough historical flavor and verity combined with enough freedom of game play to make this a near masterpiece of game design. Playing it overcame my skepticism of point to point movement games. The use of cards, properly incorporated in the design places limits on absolute freedom of play, but it does so in a fashion that does not strait-jacket players to the historical outcome. One can quibble about some of the strange things that can happen in this game I suppose, but really strange things happen in real life all the time. Put yourself back in 1933. Ask yourself whether you could have predicted the next 12 years. (Hint: If you say yes, you are lying.)

Played it once. I really like it and hope to play it again. The big downside is playing time. For the whole war, a newbie player pretty much has to invest 10+ hours of playing time.

Updating this form a 6 to a 7. The long playing time is still a bummer, but this game is really great at recreating the strategic decisions of WWI. Plus, I am currently really obsessed with this topic.

Update: Dropping this back to a 6 due to the time commitment needed.

Sold at BGG.con 2015 flea market (4th edition).

Update: Revisited this recently and upping it to a 8 again. I am now playing this regularly with Prof. Paul, and once you get over the initial hump it really starts shining. So many strategic choices, so little resources!

My current favorite. I am a WW1 "nut" though and feel that this game captures most of what it should. the Eastern front is fairly mobile with the Germans able to drive the Russian back slowly with "Austrian" help; while on the Western front one always gets the feel that you just missed advancing in the battle. As both sides there is always a feeling that if there was just a little more to devote to both fronts then you could steamroll the other player. Resources and actions are tight, but never to the extent where you feel your cause in hopeless.

My one complaint is that you really need to work to get the US entry or the Russian exit from the war.

This is an excellent game of WWI.  Have looked for years for a fun tense game of WWI that isn't just a grind.   This game has great tension, which I love, driven by a decision between playing the right card at the right time OR moving that critical unit at the critical time.  Great mix with Cards vs moving units.  Have been gaming since 1959 and working on my 11 year old son (1996) with easier games.  Have over 1,000 games and buy all the time and play several times each week with other older gamers.

Love the tough decisions in managing your cards. Which events do I trigger, how do I use my precious ops, and what card is my opponent going to play next? In my handful of plays I have yet to make it past a few turns into Limited War, so a lot of the board has not come into play. Might be nice to have a scenario that starts later in the war since the first few turns play fairly similar each game.

However the complexity would likely drop to a 3 after multiple plays and if both players are familiar with the game.

The game shines with its possibilities to manage the ressources of the different fronts (one more army into the balkans or to the fields of flanders?).
I don't like how it models the political change in Russia, but of course it is difficult. A successfull bolshewik revolution was not that probable...

RATING: 8.6
Card driven WW I strategy game with quite a steep learning curve due to the many exceptions to the many rules. Once you get the hang of it, it nevertheless turns into a really absorbing game. Time flies as you ponder on how to play 6 of your 7 cards. Each card can be used in four ways: play an event, play a number of operations (moves and attacks, maybe entrench once this card has been played as an event by either player), use a number of strategic redeployment points to reposition over long distances, or prepare to replace your lost troops at the end of the turn by augmenting the replacement points for some or all of the nations on your side. The mandatory offensive die roll at the start of each turn is a great mechanism in order to avoid play being too cautious. The probability that neither side has to attack is low, and it falls as more countries join the war. The mandatory offensives also steer the war in a certain direction. Mixed with the event cards, which introduce real historical events, you get an evolution which is not too different from history, but still different enough in order to make it fun to play (changing history is fun!).

After that, I leave it to the sharks.

Excellent system.  This game manages to add a reasonable amount of complexity and depth without sacrificing playability. Definitely not a simulation, but a fantastic game. Very fun to play.

Optional rules recommended, or CP may have a hard time.  Initial rating of 10 dropped to 8 because I feel card draw can be too significant in the early game and because I'm not convinced the Russian capitulation rules are properly done. The issue with the overabundance of Italian VP's has also been well documented.

Still, for all its issues, this has remained a staple of my wargame collection, and I continue to play it on occasion many years after its release.

Includes Player's Guide.

I'd love to give PoG a 10/10, I really would. However the game is badly, BADLY in need of a revision and update and a significant streamlining (I've played it at least a dozen times all the way through, and the Russian Revolution seems to hardly ever happen), and the number of things to keep track of on the counter is ludicrous.

The board needs to be a bit bigger, as the Western Front gets stupidly overcrowded - spaces in front of the main squares to record trench levels, fortress destroyed etc? The whole recording system for tracking VPs, Russian Revolution, US entry, replacement points etc needs an overhaul, and some of the cards are beyond useless - why have a card for the first intro of tanks, when it doesn't do anything? I understand the point of it, but in a game with relatively few cards it encourages the player to waste his hand on something that was NOT a dead-end technology.

Please, somebody, give this one an update and a streamlining. PoG is simultaneously beautiful and ugly in its mechanics and, like those frumpy housewives on reality TV shows, would benefit hugely from some TLC and trimming of the flab.

--------

EDIT:

Having played a couple of games of this recently, after leaving it alone for a while, I feel the urge to revisit my score. Unfortunately this one hasn't aged well and the mechanics are increasingly irrelevant. There is simply far too much to be done, and not enough time or cards to attain it. Consequently some theatres (yes, I'm looking at you Near and Middle East) see almost no action at all whilst the Western Front remains ludicrously, insanely scripted. The game is too proscriptive in gameplay, the actions are underpowered and the outcome is almost always arrived at unrealistically. The years haven't been kind to PoG and I suspect that new releases/revisitations in the next few years will see it slip away from the top ranks.

This is a great game but the rules are badly written and full of exceptions which makes them a pain to read and understand. The game also seems prone to gamey moves that are quite unhistorical. I would suggest that you use Ted Raicer's historical variant as it irons out some of those problems in the game.

Update: After some more playings the game really shine so upped my score to a 9. So many options so few cards... With the designer's optional rules it's a clear 10. Upped it to a 10 as I always play with the optionals anyway.

Wow, this is a quite a game.  The base rules are fairly simple to grasp, but there are so many exceptions.  I think I would need to play this weekly in order to rememeber all of the rules.  I enjoy the management of multiple fronts and precarious supply lines.

I can't rate it higher than a 8 because of the lengthy play time.  Hopefully this will come down with more plays and I can adjust the rating upwards.

Update: Who am I kidding?  This game is exceptional.  It is the best CDW I have played.  Hard to believe it was released in 1999.  It's not showing any age at all.  I have to bump it up to a 10.  Yes, it is long, but I now consider it the grail of CDWs.

Update2: This game keeps getting better and better. It eventually moved into my top 10, and I now consider it my favorite game.

Although this game is hugely popular, I find it intolerable.  First of all, as written there are no real constraints against wildly ahistorical behavior like Brit armies in Italy, German Corps in Turkey and such.  With the option to avoid the &quot;Guns of August&quot; event, the Germans can also manipulate the War Level track to prevent Total War, which seems ridiculous to me.  Curiously, the only design element intended to force a certain historical progression (the fall of Russia) doesn&#039;t work!
  The game also has a fatal flaw due to the separate decks design ‚Äì it&#039;s much easier for the German player to count cards and ensure that he gets through his levels in one pass through each deck.  With the huge number of reinforcements the Allies have, that&#039;s nearly impossible.  If a single deck were used, the ability to use (or attraction of) that kind of strategy would be greatly reduced.
  Lastly, the game play itself is very chess like ‚Äì encircling moves in the east, calculated gambits in the west.  It lacks spontaneity or surprise.  That may actually be the secret of the games broad appeal, but to me it&#039;s a death knell.

RATING: 10
Very tense and engaging CDWG, perhaps rivaled only by Hannibal or Twilight Struggle, who fit in a more approachable time slot.   PoG seems to be in the 5-7 hour range, which is fine for me if it is split into different sessions.   The game manages to generate its tension by forcing you to juggle multiple fronts of the war on the map with limited resources (cards, armies, and ops). Some areas are very fragile and will keep you sweating.  Losing supply of armies is the biggest fear.  Because each player has his own deck, there is almost a deck-building aspect to this game that is very unique in CDWGs - you want to get your good cards into your deck and weed out the weak ones, and this is a whole additional level of tension resident in the decisions. Many events are centered on getting more armies onto the map, which is also an important part of the game.  Unfortunately, there are a ton of little exceptions in the rules and a lot of seemingly rare situations which muddle it down with too much chrome, although it becomes second nature with a few plays.   The core parts of the game aren't that difficult, but require some playing through to become engrained.   I haven't been able to stop thinking about it, this is the kind of game that can become an obsession - there's just so many things to think about, and so many approaches.   If I could only keep one wargame in my collection, this would be it.

My ultimate wargame, both for times played and for sheer tension and fun. Although  abit lacking as a strategic simulation of WWI, it offers great insights nonetheless. As the CP player, you are juggling to keep all the balls in the air; West front, East front, Balkan front, Italian front, not to mention the Turks and their many commitments. As the AP player you find yourself understanding why this war took four years to end. Thet doesn't mean it can't finish before the leaves fall, though! Make just that one mistake and you'll find yourself setting up a new one ...

Why is this getting a 10?  

It delivers exactly what I want out of a wargame.  Richly thematic, epic sweep, meaty deep gameplay, an ability to out think and manuever your opponent, some vicissitude of fate... 

All of this is wrapped up in a card driven package that provides, at it's core, a euro game feel where elegant design brings out a sustain tension of decision making.  It gives all the weighty decision making that one of Knizia's tile laying games provides, but within the context of a sprawling theme.

From my initial impressions, this is a top-notch game. There are a lot of trade-offs and tough decisions to be made on both sides. There are so many trade-offs it reminds me of a Eurogame. :) Doesn't quite make it into my top rank of wargames though. The "gamey-ness" of the system has already been well pointed out by many wargamers, which means that somewhere along the line, the game will break down in its modelling of the historical situation, if not the history. Italy is way too tempting for the CP to pass up...

Standard CDG, but with a billion exceptions and minute rules.  I think I've actually played a few turns where I didn't break/miss any rules (maybe). It's a little odd to balance the resources between the different nations as one player. As the Allied Powers, does it makes sense that if Russian is doing a lot, France can't?  Less of a logic leap with the Central Powers, but still the same issue. I think I have a lot to learn, but I can tell the design is considered a classic for a reason.

RATING: 8
Easily the most tension filled wargame I've ever played. There's so much pressure on all your fronts plus needing precious reinforcement points that you feel like you're failing everywhere. But thing is, so does the other guy. The card choices are absolutely gut wrenching in the best of ways. It's absolutely thrilling to sit in the chair for this one and I highly recommend it to any serious wargamer.

On the downside, the game is a beast to learn. Took me several plays before things became ingrained. And then there's the infamous supply rules. They make for great tension but seems every game we played, somebody missed a weak point somewhere and somebody's army got surrounded and, well, that's all she wrote. 

In my last game, the allies had me on the run. Russia was pushing west in a big way. Germany lent A-H some units to try and hold them off but it didn't look good. Then I spotted one little point on the map where, if I could occupy it, would cut practically his entire Russian army off from supply. I made the move, attacked, won the battle, and locked my units behind him. 

My friend was not happy that one oversight on his part could lose him an entire front. We called the game there as he had no desire to continue and haven't played since.

RATING: 7
October 2013; first game played. Very interesting game, which does a fantastic job of presenting the sweep of WWI in a manner which is dynamic, flavoursome and entertaining. Very much a game of manouevre - the point to point nature of the board acts to create tactical opportunites and dangers. The supply rules are very important. Efficient manufacture of threat sufficent to cause one's opponent to respond with less comparative efficiency is important. Like Twilight Struggle, the card play is designed such that it feels as if one is responding inadequately to a range of demands - events, operations, replacements, strategic redeployment... Deck management is important, but at heart this is a wargame of manouevre. Looking forward to playing more!

There is an excellent game in there somewhere but I've yet to find it. Solo games only. Will revisit someday and will probably raise my rating. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
StukaJoe's solo variant is godsend. Will try it soon and reevaluate my score.

Edit 1: Raised my rating from 7.5 to 8.0.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After another campaign game I can say that the game is not a historical simulation for sure, but the fun factor gets higher with experience. Deciding what to do next and trying to pocket or protect armies from going OOS even solo is a gut-wrenching experience.

Edit 2: Raised my rating from 8.0 to 8.5.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After a couple of games more now I have a final point for the game. The game is very good for competitive play. Solo method works perfectly well. But the game provides too much ahistorical results; Austrians capturing Italy and going to France and attacking from the back was one I saw in my last play. 

Edit 3: Good game but dropping from 8.5 to 7, reflecting my final opinion about the game.

Based on 17 plays.
+ Every game is full of excitement, from the first turn to the last.
+ One of the most enjoyable games I have played.
> My first real wargame. I was first very suspicious about the (long) playing time. Fortunately I have no regrets about purchasing this game, quite the contrary!
> Full campaign lasts over 10 hours. I enjoy every hour, and that's what matters. If I just find time to play it.
> If anyone has difficulties finding a face-to-face opponents, there is always Internet and ACTS.
- One needs to find enough time for a full campaign.
- Component quality is of regular wargame quality, that is, rather poor. In my opinion, the gameplay compensites everything.
- Rules include a large number of exceptions, which is cognitively demanding.

Updated 9->10 in 2011 after 17 plays. Despite its shortcomings, I keep on coming back to this game regularily.

RATING: 10
This is one I would run back inside the house on fire to get; that I would take on a desert island; that I will play lots and lots for the foreseeable future; that tortured me at every action and decision.  I'm a big fan of card driven games and this is probably my favorite (or a close second to Hannibal).  The Austro-hungarian is really the sick puppy that needs constant monitoring for the CP and things get much worse once Turkey joins the war.  For the allies, I agree with Chris Farrell's comment about the exagerated importance of Italy especially given that it is really weak.  France really has a hard time and needs to be defended wisely because early on, the germans are very dangerous.  Make sure to plug all those holes in your line; supply is atrociously nasty in this game.  Also, if you can't manage to hit the Serbs early, then you'll need to be creative; the austrians spend the bulk of the game just hanging on for dear life.  Keep an eye on the russian, a slow but steady growth of russian armies will lead to an austrian collapse.  While it is easy to be lured into Dances of Death, it will take a few tries before you get it right.  By then, the opponent will probably have gotten much wiser.  I repeat: plug those holes.

Fantastic game,  playing by email and face to face.   It's very tense and fun to learn- each game opens it up a bit more for me.  Long play time.  It's the kind of game for me that just doesn't get played often enough.  Like Rommel in the Desert, supply will kill you if you don't plan your turns around it.  In Kansas City we have a fantastic WWI museum and WWI is a favorite historical period for me.  This game sums the conflict up in a comprehensive way and gives it some life.  For this I rate it highly.

Noun: The state of playing Paths of Glory.

This game pulls you in so many directions.  It feels like you're falling apart on every front.  Combine that with 4 different uses you want to put each card to and the extra decision of individual deck management, and the tension is ratcheted into the stratosphere.  The historical evolution of the war is fascinating with some interesting chrome-y elements like Lawrence of Arabia.  As far as difficulty of wargame rules/"chrominess" go, PoG doesn't have a great reputation, but I really think it's at the lower end of the spectrum.  The core of the game is quite simple and once you understand the exceptions they are mostly easy to remember from a thematic standpoint.

The only drawbacks of PoG are its length and the fragility of equilibrium along each front.  As an inexperienced player it's very easy to find yourself forced out of supply even if you discount stupid mistakes that open yourself up to this kind of thing.  It makes the game a little more taxing and calculating than I would like lest the game be about who makes the first stupid mistake than the whole picture.

1 turn into this and I immediately understood why this is a modern wargame classic.  The rules are not nearly as difficult as people say.  Every card play is agonizing as the amount of decisions to process is pretty intense.  This is a game that you can spend a life time trying to master.  The supply rules are absolutely brutal and the game bogs down into a (not as boring as it sounds) historical stalemate on the western front.  It is long for sure, but worth the time.

Here's a game that will take some time to get proficient at. Preferably your first games will be with someone who know the rules fairly well as there are many exceptions to the basics. I enjoy the tension created by the choices.  There seems lots of strategies to explore, so what if some of them are historically implausible.  Knowing cards is a big advantage and that only comes with experience.

RATING: 7
I would play this any time, any place.  I'd especially love to start playing face to face as up to now I've only played a number of pbem games.  This game is fantastic.  

The tension this game puts in both players simultaneously is amazing.  On most turns both players have the exact same uneasy feeling that their forces could be broken and the game ended this turn.  The game just oozes WWI.  Not just the cards and expected historical chrome and exceptions--but everything just works towards making it feel like the great war.  The mechanics, tables, etc are suited perfectly to WWI.  Battles end up with horrendous losses and after most assaults you're left feeling like "just one more assault with one more army..." could finish off an entrenched enemy position, just like I'm sure the real generals involved often felt.  

On top of that, the game feels like it has many options and the war could be decided in a number of places with a few different viable strategies.  My understanding is that Racier's game on the Eastern front in WWII doesn't feel like this--I could understand that given the nature of that particular conflict, with one natural opponent and a very deterministic flow to the game.  This game does not feel nearly as deterministic.The rules have a huge number of exceptions which increase the weight of the game and make your first one or two games learning games, but the baseline mechanics which will be done in most turns are very straightforward and clear.

Overall, a definite 10 for me and at the top of my top 10.

Update March 2007.  This game still delivers.  Started playing it Ftf and I'm not convinced it's not better with the slower pace of PBEM.  Also, it would be nice to be able to skip through mobilization more quickly to get to the meat of the of game, LW and TW, faster.  I suppose there is the scenario available that already does this...

Regrade Feb 08:
Moved it down to 9.  It is still probably one of the best designs of all time.  But for me, I've worn this game out in some respects and the beginning is so predictable it is a grind to get through.  The gameyness of some of the moves once you get better, especially the race to get Italy into the game or else watch all of it die in a collapse is completely tiresome to me.  This is still a 10 in design quality, but it has moved down to 9 for my enthusiasm to play it.

Regrade Summer 09

Down to an 7.  Don't play it too often.  Would rather play other CDGs that don't have the annoying Italy and Turkish subgames.  That has to be considered a downside of the game, no matter how many excuses are given.

RATING: 8
This game is daunting.  Every card has multiple uses, you're playing multiple nations, and there are lots of exceptions, and things that are easy to forget, and then there is the play-time factor.  Even so, this is an impressive game with a lot of theme and right from the get-go this game is tense.  I will definitely have to play this one again now that I have more of a handle on it, but I can see why people like this game.  Finding the time to play this though, is another matter.  I just don't see how I can get in the whole dang war.  Typical GMT quality, but you can purchases a better quality board.

Great game, well tested mechanics, high replayability value. Love it. After playing many games though I have to add the following remarks:

1) Brest Litovsk treaty is practically almost impossible to achieve (never seen one myself).

2) Russian army is too strong and strategically undestroyable.

3) US intervention is also practically impossible to achieve (never seen one myself), as the games will end before while the combined war status would hardly reach the required level.

4) CP don't stand a chance, this is almost always true if you play standard rules.

These major flaws don't allow the simulation of key hystorical events, reducing the overall value of the game. My rating still stays high, mostly because of the pioneering political related authentic "Card Driven System" introduced by the design.

The precursor of a new "family" of card-driven games (including my own design "Crusade and Revolution: The Spanish Civil War, 1936-1939").

"Paths of Glory" is a modern classic and a milestone in the history of wargames.

An excellent use of CDG format that has taken the wargaming world by storm. You'll find yourself shifting forces and resources around and looking for opportunities while staving off disaster in other parts of the world. Only problems are some fiddly rules, and a few poorly designed cards. Otherwise it is genuinely exciting and challenging. Also, make sure you play with Raicer's historical variant that allows you to play certain cards for text and operations points. Without this, the game is merely an 8 rating.

Every match I've played has snowballed into a blowout when a gap opened in the line and those draconian supply rules kicked in. Most wargames have that depressing feature where thirty seconds of brain fade can undo eight hours of play and planning, but the punishment for making an innocuous mistake is especially severe in this game. Still the best strategic WWI game out there.

I don't think there is a game that has given me the same gut drenching emotions this game has given me. 
Buy this game, play this game! :)

*** UPDATE ***
This is my NUMBER 1¬∞.

*** UPDATE ***
I'm in the process of getting the mounted board. 
Cannot wait for it!
I'm still very happy with this game, the only thing is that even after something around ten games, I still don't have a clue on how to play this game well. 
Very tough decisions every move, lots of tension. This game is the total winner for me. 

*** UPDATE ***
Finally the mounted board has arrived!
After 12 games or so, I'm starting to get a feel for the game. I think I'm going to start with some variants, namely 8 cards in hand, they say CC can be played in that way. I also ordered the players' guide, so I'll play with the new cards as well. 

*** UPDATE ***
You'll always be torn between what you'd like to do, and what you ought to do. That excruciating tension is the delight of this game.

Spectacular game.  Really captures the feel of WWI and the problems involved with it.  Lots of decisions to make and things to figure out.  Front movements and a side-show campaign.  Takes much longer than it feels like it will, which is bad.

The only reason it's not a 10 is that Here I Stand is truly a step above, purely because of the multi-player interactions.

My first card driven wargame as well as my first WWI themed title.  I enjoy it a lot, even with the length of time it takes to play.

RATING: 5.99999
A good transition game to wean hexbased grognards off their old style games and introduce them to the world of CDGs.

The designer clearly wants you to re-fight WWI the way he KNOWS it should be fought and is willing to micro-manage your options to make that happen; This tightly constricted  mind set resulted in heavily scripted game flow stemming from card counting/manipulation and consequently lead to extreme anti-historical game winning strategies (going after Italy's lopsided VPs and heavy activity in what were historically backwater theatres of operation) as revealed by veteran rules busters. The guys who broke the code on this game are not Heretics, they are the playtesters an honest designer/developer should WANT to put a game through the wringer before it hits the street. Not horrific but certainly not the Classic a lot of people seem to think. Some problems are fixable with House Rules but that, of course, severely limits game play to like minded gamers and ruins any Tournament preparations play.

I don't get why this is so well liked.  This type of game is set up so that the cards will have the rule exceptions on them, yet there are pages of errate with more exceptions.  Whole rules which are, at best, inferred.  An author who belittles the players (read through the Consimworld stuff).  Sorry, not for me.

RATING: 5
Great looking game. Obviously a good system based on the number of subsequent games using it.  That being said, in this particular environment, I am not particularly fond of this game.  Almost every game we have played has seen decisive results in '14/'15.  The Western Front seems to have an awful lot of movement compared the to actual event.  I think there are two things at work: 1) unit density is low; no nations have enough units to hold historical lines without leaving something too weak to hold, and 2) the game is very chess-like in that one bad move can cost you the war, and a bad play is not evident until several moves (or turns) later, meaning that you have to have extensive experience to play and know all the pro's/con's associated with each card.

So you end up with a game that is probably balanced, but that ends up having little to do with WW1.  The missing includes:

1-Russian capitulation; the Russians are way too resilient
2-Americans; no russian capitulation, no Americans
3-Italy being non-decisive; Italy is so weak and VP ripe, Germans, British and French will be drawn in like a counter-factual hurricane.

After just a little bit, it seems like this game takes longer than it should.  It feels like the gameplay is drawn out.  Sometimes it just seems like there is nothing to do, other times there is too much to do.  While that it typical in a CDG, it doesn't feel right here.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This seems pretty much what I`ve been looking for: a wargame without tedious, time consuming gameplay, with lots of choices concerning strategies and a subject that I find highly interesting.

Sometimes it does however take liberties on history in the interests of good gameplay but I can live with that. It also has extremely cruel supply rules with whole fronts collapsing to bits due to player mistakes, particularly in Russia. Lots of our game time goes into making sure that we absolutely positively can`t be outflanked, but that also makes the game very tense.

Overall, it seems to be able to maintain its appeal for a very long time. Definitively tremendous value for money.

Edit: after downloading Ted¬¥s historical variant we haven¬¥t played a game without it. All the changes it makes are for the better, and I¬¥d certainly recommend it to all PoGgers out there.

Update 2009: After a long hiatus playing other games I recently returned to good old PoG. This time spent away has made me realize one thing: Paths of Glory is not just a good game, it¬¥s an excellent one. Rating upgraded to 10.

Decreased from 8 to 6.  The rules are very complicated with lots of exceptions.  This means it's only ever going to appeal to a small subset of gamers, which means not much opportunity to play it.  In fact, I never have played a face-to-face game, just a couple of solitaire games.

Initial
Played as a soliataire game.

RATING: 9
Wonderful, intense game. The rule book now has all the errata included and could do with a rewrite to consolidate exceptions by unit or game area rather than a specific rule. The underlying game flows well but with a lot of agonising decisions. Combat is simple yet deep, there are no interception, evasion or leader rules to worry about and the fort and besieging rules are easy to remember. 

The out of supply really is a non issue. Most players will give a friendly warning and it is needed to ensure players adhere to WW1 style supply considerations without a whole set of complex supply rules being needed.

The Historical Scenario in the rulebook is perfect for those who want US entry and Russian capitulation to have a higher chance.

RATING: 10
Absolutely wonderful game, well-deserving of all of the praise it gets here on BGG. I can't recommend this enough.  The decision making is absolutely gut wrenching on both strategic and tactical levels.  Which fronts to concentrate on?  How to attack each front?  Do I try to push through the bottleneck in france or try to take down a fortress and collapse the line?  Or do I hold there and concentrate on the russian front?  Do the germans try to stomp france or play conservative?  Destroy russia?  Or bank on Italy's soft underbelly showing up?  Just absolutely fantastic, especially for a pretty short playing time considering the scope of the game.

Fairly steep learning curve but not bad for a wargame and not bad at all for the amount of fun and enjoyment you will get out of this once you learn.  A more beautiful and perfect wargame design would be very difficult to find.  The low counter density makes the game easy to manage, although the strategy is deep.  Its incredible how things you thought were minor when you first learned the game quickly become the most important things as you learn the game, like strategic redeployment and supply.  

I'm not sure about the pro-allies balance issue everyone speaks of but I've only played two games so far.  Maybe there is a slight imbalance but it isn't a big deal at all.  A shift of one victory point might overcompensate.  

VASSAL module makes this very soloable and playable even for folks who can't find opponents. 

Depth and replayability... mind bogglingly good game.

This is a very tense game. The mechanics are easy, if you can decipher the rules. The rules are poorly written with lots of exceptions. There is a definite learning curve. There are so many threats in the game and its easy to overextend. You need much more than your turn allows, so it is always a balance of what you need to do. What a tense game! Very fun!

good: CDG Strategic - WWI - Medium 

Enough said already about this groundbreaking game.

Plus:
-Great strategic situation; I'd never thought WWI could be so exciting!
-Several scenario's that can be played in a day session
-Very tense and great historic feel
-High replay value
-Great quality components

Minus:
-Fun but funny history
-Experienced players have a clear advantage by knowing what cards must be played at what time.
-Western Front a bit too confined and abstracted compared to the resources that went there.
-Once you played Pursuit of Glory you really miss the extra detail in PoG.

What great fun WW I can be! It seemed rather boring to me but I was wrong that it was just a huge stalemate with trenches, trenches & trenches. This game is vibrant with excellent balance and lot's of choices. A classic hardly to be surpassed.  

After I got the magnificent Pursuit of Glory, this hardly sees table anymore.

I just ordered it from UGG in Germany. 
Perhaps I can persuade some players in the region to actualy play it and I think the deluxe version is more then worth the money.

UPDATE: After the play of the intro scenario, I must say that this game isn't hard to learn rules-wise, but the strategic side will take a lot more plays.
Really nice flow and super functional counters + map makes the game flow with  a lot of ease.


UPDATE1: Just played through a campaign game solo. Wow, what game. There are to many layers to see through for a novice player like me, but I will put this on the table very soon.

RATING: 10
Top 5 wargame of all time or arguably the best wargame there ever war: 10,000+ hours of WBC tourney competition related to the game says it all.

One of a handful of wargames that ushered in "The Second Golden Age of Wargaming". A hell of lot of fun and a completely engaging gaming experience. If you like historical strategy games, buy this one and wear the counters out. Packed full of difficult decisions with every card play.

Huge following (30,000 messages on Consimworld), ACTS/Cyberboard/Vassal and very strong tourney (top notch sharks) at WBC every summer (details on boardgamers.org). Frequently, the final comes down to the final play (120 card plays by each player) and last die roll turn 20 between two evenly matched sharks, and eight grueling hours. 

The designer also responded to player strategies and tricks with elegant upgrades/fixes and a thick skin. And, the PoG fanboys took a real interest in the game; comprehensive errata, wrote the final version of the rules, answer Q&A 24x7, run tourneys, etc. 

The "PoG is ahistorical" critism in some quarters is simply noise. Don't let it distract you from playing this masterpiece. There is now a recent (2009) "historical" scenario that is being played at the WBC tournies that provides the game with a fresh appeal after 10 years and a few bajillion plays, if you ever tire of the basic campaign game.

Probably about the best blend of gut wrenching strategy choices, chrome, complexity and elegant rules in any wargame that I have ever played. It will also cause you to read a book or two on WWI.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
All I ask in a wargame is that the historical outcome at least be possible to achieve. In PoG, a historical outcome is, strictly speaking, impossible due to the nature of the event-coupled cards. At first I was intrigued by this game, but when I realized that an historical result could never occur -- despite all those wonderful events catalogued in all those cards -- well, I'd rather play some other fantasy game. For instance, the US seems to always enter too late, while the Russians hang on too long -- and in my book two wrongs don't make a right! If you're interested in a game about WW1 where events can [u]never[/u] transpire as in history, PoG stands right along [thing=4358][/thing] at the top of that *heap.*

RATING: 7
A game I like a lot but suffers from quite a few problems IMHO. In three games I've never seen the late war and only barely seen the mid-war decks. The supply rules are crushingly brutal and the game can devolve into a "dance of death" where it becomes all about maneuver which doesn't feel like WW1 to me. Also, like most other CDGs, its slavish adherence to historic events in deck construction paradoxically leads to totally ahistoric play in every single game. Since that's a failing of the genre as a whole I don't hold it against the game much. My biggest complaints center around how often the game seems to be decided in the first few months (at least in my plays so far).

Pretty good game. I like the subject and the system. It really revived the card driven games (CDG) genre. My games tended to end in a stalemate rather than a win, so didn't like that. Also, US entry and Russian Revolution never happened out of say 10 games. I thought that there should have been a mechanism to make them more likely. Other than that, it's fun to play.

RATING: 8
The PoG system is the most complex development of We the People to date. It's often compared to Chess, and shares some of Chess's problems: it's essential to play regularly if you're going to 'get' the game and mistakes are brutally punished to the extent of costing you the win. The best part is the card play. You're constantly torn between wanting to move and attack for immediate advantage, play events for the longer term and deck trim to improve future prospects, while simultaneously getting to improve your war status. I'm a bit less impressed by the fiddle factor: small counters, a busy map and tons of special rules all designed to push the game down a roughly historical path. Playing time is also a big concern. The 10 hour Campaign scenario will have to wait for retirement, the very short scenarios (Introductory, 1915) are fine for learning the system, but depend too much on a few critical die rolls to really be satisfactory games. The mid-length stuff (Limited War, 1917) is either poorly balanced or misses out on the deck building/trimming portion of the game. Need to play this more to see if it grows on me or whether the tedium outweighs the better elements.

Very cool and fun game on WWI. The innovative card-driven game runs smoothly and quickly. The history sometimes 'feels' slightly odd in that some of the strategic choices are limited to what your hand comes up with, this is in a sense realistic as the historical 'players' didn't have access to any hindsight. It definitely does have loads of atmosphere, and can easily be played in a single long sitting.

RATING: 8
Even though some once considered it an impossible topic for a good wargame, Raicer‚Äôs classic strategic game on WWI is considered by many to be the best wargame of the 1990s.  Too many impressive design elements to mention each; the best is the way that the replacement system self-balances the action on the different fronts.  The game has received some fairly vitriolic criticism for its perceived lack of realism.  While I am normally sympathetic to historical concerns, I feel that much of it is misplaced for this game.  The two biggest historical problems in the game‚Äîthe fragility of the Italian front and the disincentive to play a number of historical events‚Äîare corrected in the official historical variant.  To be fair, some historical problems do remain.  Most importantly in my mind are the inefficiency of rail movement (which is the real cause of the ‚Äúdance of death‚Äù phenomenon in my view) and some strange happenings in the Near East (the treatment of the MEF is particularly poor).  As is often the case, house rules are an option for those bothered by these issues.  Overall, the underlying system is solid, the design is brilliant, and the game itself is one of the most entertaining wargames of all time.  A triumph.  I just wish it were a bit shorter and didn‚Äôt rely as much on special rules.

Update: I think I finally got my head around this game.  I've revised my rating up.  

I can see why this game is highly rated.  The design was ground breaking when it was created and the game play is very tense.  Furthermore, it is the best implementation of WWI I at this scale have played.  However, it is not a game I will choose to play often.  While I REALLY like the card driven system and own and have played many card driven games, POG often just frustrated me.  I love the tense decision making and trade-offs that that the CDG system creates, and I expect to encounter turns where you just don't really have the cards you need.  However, unlike in other CDG's I've played, in POG I often simply felt helpless with the game developing in a way I can foresee well in advance but can do nothing about even over several rounds or hands. Perhaps I just suck at this game, but I doubt that is what is at the bottom of my problem with this game because my experience has been much more favorable with most of the many other CDG I've played.

RATING: 9
As the first foray into board wargaming for someone who generally plays modern Euro games, this was a challenge due to the relative complexity of the rules (or more precisely, the number of rules exceptions). But the effort was well worth making. Each time I play PoG, I enjoy it more. 

UPDATE: I've returned to PoG after about 4 years. In the meantime I have played many other wargames, but PoG still stands out as the best game overall. The card play adds another dimension, and a not inconsiderable amount of theme, to what is already a very good strategic wargame.

Perhaps one of the best CDG wargames out there. I think the system itself, as presented here, works very well for WWI rather than WWII, with its concentration on Armies and Fronts. Although its sister game, Barbarossa to Berlin is OK, I don't think the POG system translated that well to WWII at this scale.

Very solid, classic card-driven wargame.

You *really* have to play it a few times to appreciate it fully, to spot subtle nuances and plays, to develop strategies, to enjoy it without any reservations.
Alas I've played too little to fall in love with it, though I really like it so far..

RATING: 9
PoG was everything I hoped it would be, a great strategic card driven wargame with great angst and tension, and one that somewhat simulates the events of WW1 so just a fabulous game and immediately shot into my top 5 wargames. 

Expanding on the above, I think what really makes PoG a great game full of tension are all the precarious situations all over the World at the time, which was nicely accounted for in the design. There are little disasters waiting to happen everywhere, so you're somewhat "walking on eggshells" much of the time and this of course drives up the tension. There are lots of fronts to hold and fight over, all the while watching carefully your supply lines as being cut off can really sting you hard. Then there are all the nasty events coming down the pike in the war decks you need to be wary of as well. Note also this is not a "political wargame", or one of great amounts of "posturing" so to speak, there is a lot of battles taking place all the time (At least there was in my game) 

Add to this the angst of not being able to do all you want, AND from having so many great options to choose from (like the 4 uses for cards) making decisions very tough and you have a real winner of a game.  

My only personal hesitations are two-fold and what I expected, but not in the order I expected. The length obviously can be a real hindrance to getting it played, but surprisingly its the exceptions in the rules that trouble me a little more. Its not old AH terrible or anything, but there are many exceptions built-in to the rules for the sake of simulating WW1 as much as possible (AFAIK) and these worry me simply because of the rule look ups during play, and for the barrier to entry when wanting to play (I have a terrible memory so the once or twice a year I pull it out I will have to read all the rules and the exceptions will be the hardest thing to remember)(This is where playing an "ahistorical variant" can be a really nice addition, since you could ignore many of these exception cases[some would argue that the vanilla game IS an ahistorical variant but this is another matter]). 

Having said that about the exceptions, the main rules themselves are incredibly intuitive thanks to them following logic in most cases (unintuitive Napoleons Triumph anyone...) and there are only 20 or so pages which is not a Monster by any means (but is close to my limit of 25). So this really helps make up for the many exceptions potentially and not all of them even come into play so overall I found play fairly fluid.

I really don't see any faults (some argue its ahistorical, and some say its scripted, so obviously it has straddled the line pretty well imho and seems just right) in the game so far, just my personal hesitations, so its very likely destined to be a 10 for me as there is just so much to like here and I think both hesitations will be overcome in time. 

------------

I definitely need to play this but it does seem pretty long. Not sure if the extra length and complexity will be worth it, hope to find out soon.

RATING: 10
Probably the first true wargame that I have learned well enough to play without consulting the rules regularly. It deserves its high rating and place at the top of the wargames category (I love Twilight Struggle, but seriously, wargame?). The CRT is great, the card events are great, the SR and RP rules are great. I love how the reserves work. I love how it recreates history but rewrites history too. It feel epic, you can never do everything you need to do during a turn, but neither can your opponent.

RATING: 6
Very unforgiving game.  The few games I've played have resulted in massive losses on both sides due to armies being out of supply at the end of a round.  Not sure if the above is typical play or a result of our inexperience and aggressive play.  I was initially put off by this razor's edge feel.  However, I keep thinking about the game and want to play again.  A good indication of a good game and one with good replayability.

Excellent stuff, although the history doesn't really work for me, even with all of the design for effect that was used.  Still, there are some very clever things going on here, and as a game, it's an awful lot of fun.

EDIT:  I'm moving this down to a 6.  I have more choices for card driven games now, many of which I like better.  I still think there is a lot of good in this game, but I'm just less likely to play it than I once was.

Good for a tense but enjoyable eight hours of gaming. The likelihood of anything approaching the historical result is slim. But maybe (as Paths of Glory has it) the Central Powers should have concentrated on Italy.

Wonderful wonderful wonderful.  With 1 play under my belt this immediately vaults to one of my favorite war games ever.  I'm out of superlatives for it.  It seems so easy and approachable now that I've played it... all those 'exceptions' don't seem nearly so daunting.  Perhaps after double digit plays some of the back/forth may get repetitive, but tell me a game that isn't in that category?  I think this is a masterpiece.  Bravo Ted Racier.

RATING: 9.5
This game causes angst unlike any other game I've played.   I am torn on every single decision I have to make.  Not only what card to play next, but whether to play an event, go for operations, or save that big card for replacements.  There's also the decision on which front you want to pursue.  Sometimes your best defense is to keep the pressure on in one front so your opponent has to respond there, keeping them from taking advantage of an opportunity elsewhere.  A brilliant design and game.

For me the best WW1 Grand strategy game, and playable in a reasonable time.  Even allows quite extreme strategy, as Germany I have both won and lost the war by spring 1915.  in both cases by trying Schliffen plan manouvers around Paris.  Tho of course most times have found me settling into that long chateau general inspired war of attrition we all know and hate so well.  The game simulates very well the factors that forced the various army commands into situations they couldnt foresee or desire.  excellent!

A different kind of CDWG from the old "leader-based" style, which is good and bad.  The tactical decisions are frustating and perfect.  You really have to balance multiple fronts and the need to resupply them.  However, the gameplay seems too gamey at times as deck management is crucial.  Burning Cards simply to maximize later hands is a bit overboard to me.  My only nitpick is the railroading.  The innovations are staggering though.  I think every CDWG should consider the Mobilization/Limited War/Total War buildup system.... its brillant.

Terrific strategic treatment of WWI--more than a decade after release, it's still widely played, which is remarkable for wargames. The actual gameplay is simpler than I expected, since there are just a few choices available with each card. The abundance of nation-specific rules and exceptions comprise most of the complexity. 

You are meant to be completely paranoid about keeping your armies in supply. The Central Powers have to be bold, since they're operating on 3 fronts and will gradually become outnumbered by the Allied Powers' superior replacement rate.

I can see the reasons for historicity issues raised by some players. That's not something I care too much about, as I obviously mostly play CDGs, but it's worth consideration. The 2010 edition of the game did include a historical variant, although maddeningly it's already out of sync with the alterations used by the WBC sharks, who seem to tinker endlessly with new rules, restrictions, and modified VP spaces.

RATING: 9.5
Relentless and always tight & tense game. 
Medium complexity but many rule exceptions to follow-up on to get the game to flow just neatly. Adjustments recommended (alternative rules, set-up).

Even if it seems that not too much's actually happening - this is how a war game should feel - it's a struggle. Always be aware of your supply line and hit on your opponent's line weaknesses. Great mechanism ! 

Actually quite simple rules but be aware of the little side-kicks :-)

Rules don't leave too much variation when it comes to game play due to strict rule design (it almost feels a bit like a corset) and event cards (you kinda know what terrible things are about to happen and always look for solutions to remediate on).

I have no idea how to rate this game. The seven is tentative. I do feel obligated to play some more. 

Paths of Glory is an exhausting game. 20 turns, 120 card plays, 250+ operations points allocated, and all while pressing or defending multiple war fronts, determining the speed of your entire mobilization (access to better cards), holding the enemy at entrenched choke points, looking for ways to threaten supply lines, assessing, allocating, and executing the build-up necessary to break through, replenishing bloodied armies, and trimming your war deck for a long-term, unforgiving contest of attrition. It took 10 hours. I'm hoping to clock in a 2nd play at 8 hours.

PoG is a big milestone for me. I'm not sure it'll become a favorite, if only because I find the sheer attrition of the game mentally exhausting. From a CDG standpoint, I'm somewhat intrigued by the 4-fold use of each card, but a bit disappointed that events don't play a bigger role in the game. It took me a while to realize that whole turns may be spent carefully amassing and positioning forces and that another whole turn (or more) may be spent breaking an opponent's line. You can not expect long-term results within the limited confines of a six-action sequence. I'm told that Shifting Sands takes the same system, trims the length by a full third, and spotlights the events. That may be more my style, but I hope to play PoG again first. So far, Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage is my armies-based CDG of choice. 


I think I like the long-term planning involved in this game, but I'm not yet sold on the attrition and the trench-digging. The trench-digging, in particular, feels awfully unengaging, even when it's the right thing to do. As for the attrition, I'm not sure how exciting it is to dig in and take body blows in the same position for 3-4 turns running. I think it might be somewhat more exciting to orchestrate repeated massive attacks to finally break through..., but it still seems a bit tiresome. Perhaps if you know the game well enough to have multiple fronts going, this fades into the background. 

I've played Twilight Struggle 30+ times, and I feel like that just barely prepares me for PoG. Then again, maybe there isn't that much of a connection. PoG is a very visual/spatial game: seeing the moving shape of your various fronts and the angles of attack and holding points for tactical retreats etc. etc. TS certainly involves anticipating and responding to an opponent's position, but the game simply doesn't have fronts or supply.

A near-perfect wargame, best enjoyed online.

Difficult decisions throughout the game, enough information to allow players to make informed decisions (at least if you have a general feel of the respective decks), but rarely total knowledge of everything. A sufficiently streamlined system to make this easy to teach, and possible to remember all important rules without constant reference. In general much more evocative of the historical period than the dusty grognard crap that's buckling under the weight of the rule sets.

I know some people get turned off by the supply system, others by the weight of the Italy and Near East theaters, and yet others by the deck management aspects. But for me none of these is a major problem. 

The supply system is simple, gives the desired effect of forcing players to maintain coherent fronts, and it's not hard to spot the gaps in your setup even if not playing a gentleman's game with OOS warnings.

As for unhistorical theaters of operation, I don't need historical accuracy. Just having the general *feel* of a WWI game is enough.

The deck management is a great (though probably unintentional) abstraction for creating short-term vs. long-term optimizations decisions.

One play and we played a lot of rules severely wrong.  I can tell though that this is a 9 or possibly a 10 when played correctly.  Amazing theme and mechanics.  My bias: CDGs are by far my favorite.  I call it a "game of exceptions" and that can make it clunky and can interrupt play constantly trying to figure out what special rules apply to what special circumstances.  The map also was very nondistinct in showing regional borders; I used a black felt tip marker to draw them out more clearly and am happy I did.

Love this game. I do wish the board was hard and not paper, but it's a minor thing. Always a lot going on and the complexity is delightful: concentrate on the western front or the east? On Italy or Romania? Bring in another country or push again with the Austrians? Lots of options, lots of fun. Don't let the thick rule book put you off, this one gets better with every play through.

RATING: 4
This is a deeply flawed game. With the original map it's absurdly ahistorical--did they playtest it at all before publishing it? The "tournament" setup and map changes are a big improvement but it still suffers from having a single action deck to run all of the Allied or Central powers which creates tradeoffs and connections between events on different front that make it feel like a game designed for people who don't know much about WW1. A number of rules are annoyingly problematic as well. In the end it combines the dubious historical accuracy of a Eurogame with the fiddly mechanical complexity of a somewhat clumsily designed wargame. It's been quite a while since I have enjoyed playing a wargame less than this one.

There are elements of a good game in that it is very competitive and you can develop good strategies.  However, it is so finely balanced and tightly scripted that you cant explore many strategies.

After limited playings, it's easy to see why this game is so popular, and why it can suck players in.  To me, it's a complex eurogame with a WWI theme.  "Do I attack here or do I bring in a reinforcement over there?" doesn't work for me in PoG, yet this choice has never been a problem in a CDG like Wilderness War -- I think it has to do with WW's lesser frequency of such decisions and greater flexibility during a turn's card play.  Plus, the narrative here is whack as history. The new deluxe map from GMT (with a copy of the 2004 rules) is very nice but unnecessary.

Why I don't like the game system and traded it away:

- Too many exceptions in the rules.

- On many fronts nothing happens at all throughout the whole game.

- The events should be out of control of the players and happen randomly (this would be muche more fun and tension!); e.g. why do players influence the weather?
  
- The decision-making between events and activations doesn't make any sense  

- the effects of out of supply are ridiculous

- you can spend all your activations on the same unit(s) without any logistical restrictions

- the game is too scripted and tries to force you into a certain pattern

- you are encouraged to take gamey decisions which have nothing to do with history: play weak cards as events even if you aren't interested in the event just to get rid of the card; don't play strong cards for events because you want to keep the card in the game

I get why wargamers like games with large stacks of chits. I am not one of these people. This is a decent WWI sim overall I suppose but would only recommend it to the wargamer crowd. Not for casuals, euro-gamers, or classic ameritrashers.

1,000,000 wargame fans can't be wrong, can they?

So far I have played one learning game into 1915 and have just started a second game.  We've yet to see Germany push into France.  The first time was intentional. The second time was a combination of a bad die roll and bad cards.  It takes the heart out of a WWI game to not have the Germans drive to Paris, in my humble opinion.  Still, it is a superbly designed game that allows for some interesting ahistorical options.

I've only played via ACTS.  I'd much rather play face to face and get the stress and misery over with in one long afternoon rather than lose sleep thinking about my next move.  Maybe I need therapy.

I have only played the introductory and limited war scenarios so far, so I am not really in a position to give a final judgement on the game.  I enjoy the ramp up from mobilization through Limited War into total war.  I like the combat system.  My major misgivings are some of the chrome rules regarding the Near East map, the entry/exit of US and Russia, and the exceptional rules that differentiate the individual powers and certain specific units.  For a strategic overview of the conflict on this level, I would prefer that there were fewer exceptions to the rules (at the price of some of the WWI flavor).  A second play has raised my rating somewhat as the basic mechanics give the game a nice flow despite the exceptions.

I would give this game 20 out of 10 if I could as it is that good. Replayability, complexity and fearful choices are wondeful, and this in a game covering World War One!

RATING: 8
Finally, a World War 1 strategic game I am seriously considering about.  The first game I bought from Avalon Hill about the war was "Guns of August".  Too bad since then for over 20 years I did not want to mix with WW1 since then as I would like to have been.  The WW1 is conceived as a boring damn-it trench warfare.  Although Guns of August is realistic in portraying the war by all means, WW1 becomes a taboo to me.  This WW1 syndrome, I hope, could be shattered with this game from Ted Raicer, who practiced his skills at WW1 during the times of "Command" game magazine.   I played 2 times both as the Allies (Central Entante), completing the 3-turns introductory and 10-turns Limited War campaign.  Although the cards can be scripting the course of the game at times, they do give a sense of war escalation as time goes by.  Trench warfare is simulated elegantly with a 2-levels trench, with captured trench turning to your side at level 1.  Nice?  You bet.  There are also combat cards which can influence a fire-strength Combat Results Table, with loss factors derived as a result.  The CRT is giving bloody results.  We both had piles of dead bodies in the replaceable units box.  This is so fun.  The game seems to grow on me eventually as it gets played more.  

I got back into this game recently after full 6 years. Gosh, it sparkles off when I was taunted by Eric, who's an expert of the game, relentlessly. It's much more interesting now than I first saw and played it. It is grand, first of all, in terms of the scale and scope of the treatment of World War I in one total package - on all fronts, even the Middle East! The cards are true to the spirit of the time of war and I think they are finely balanced in the sense that how each card is designed. Decision is tough to make to play which card and at what time. The game covers everything WWI essentials. I spent every minute entertaining! It's close to history, unlike many others saying it was just a game about WWI. Many players lost the game because they were punished by the brutal supply rules - the whole front collapsed when the units were cut off from supply as the opponent captured the critical cities (just what Eric did to me as he could always find the weakest link on the board). Historically, the front might not have collapsed as horribly as in the game. But I find it completely plausible as to what would have gone differently historically. Great game. I have notched its rating up!

Although torn into pieces by Eric one time here and another time there, I am finally convinced that it is a playable, fun and best WWI strategic level game - if not the most authentic.  However, I still believe what happened in the game is historically valid and could have happened.  I have to re-read the strategy guide to find the tips to face Eric next time.

Have avoided WWI due to bad experience with AH's 1914 eons ago. Had opportunity to be graciously taught the game by Eric Brosius. Went through about half the turns but as Central Powers realized to newbie mistakes (too late) 1 Not moving War Status quickly enough and 2 Switching focus too much.

Due to its length, it would be best played by those who are willing to recognize how slim their chances of victory are becoming and resign.

Will look forward to playing again.

A card driven war game similar to Twilight Struggle but set in World War I.  It is a good game, highly thematic and well done.  But it takes far too long to play and learn.  It is 12-24 hour game.

Wonderful game. Every time you play a card you must make a significant choice and make some trade-off, and the deck is one of the best balanced of all card-driven series, equal to the ones of Hannibal and The Napoleonic Wars but with some exellent deck management elements (it's really important get rd of all those pesky 2ops cards...). After some game the gameplay became quick and the rules are not so difficult, but the depht of this gem is immense. Try it: is a must!
UPDATE
After a lot of play I find myself a little bored of the card management side of this game: not that is a bad thing, just I don't like so much this aspect.

If this was just a 'game' I'd give it 10.  However it is supposed to be a game about World War One but can play out so ahistorically as to become a pure fantasy.  In this sense it has some deep flaws - the French Mutiny is inevitable but the Russian Revolution is not - and there's plenty more like this.  If you can put that aside then this is a gem of a game.  Great mechanics, no two games play alike.  Every time someone comes up with a killer strategy, someone else counters it.  I've lost count of the number of games I've played.

Very good CDG about World War I. It goes beyond the typical view of the trench war in France to expand to Italy, Eastern Europe and the Middle East.

The CDG system used is really clever as it forces the player to choose every time between movement or combat operations, reinforcements, strategic redeployment or historical events. The choices are never easy!

Even with the "historical" tweaks it still bears little resemblance to history at times. I'll give the game credit for producing tense game play. Tends to play longer than most CDGs - its basically an all day affair or I'd rate it a tad higher.

2 / 5 - Fair.

Based on one play, I can't say as I found this terribly compelling. I wanted to like it, but the combination of complex rules and the huge map and spread-out units did my head in. This rating may be unfair: if I had hours of time and an extremely patient tutor perhaps I would appreciate the game more. But this is real life and I have neither, so the rating accurately reflects my desire to play.

Worth all the praise it has gotten. There are plenty of wargames that claim to be simulations, but no one matches this. Altough playing POG almost allways leads to "unhistoric" developments, the feel of WWI is allways there. Tragic machine with no soul that endlessly grinds material and human lives. Great great game.

Very tense game. I like the multiple fronts and the multiple ways that each card can be used. After only 3 games I still don't have a good sense of how important deck culling is, although it seems less important here than Shifting Sands. There's a lot of room for long-term strategy in terms of which fronts to emphasize, which minors to bring in and when, how fast to push the war status, etc. I do wonder about the swingyness of the combat system. There's such a huge difference between a 5 result and a 7 on the western front it seems that a pair hot dice could really do a lot of damage in this theater (I in fact saw this happen in 2 out my 3 games).

Innovative design, which in no small part explains the game's massive sales success (using current yardsticks).  By BGG criteria an "8":  "Very good game. I like to play it.  Probably I'll suggest it and will never turn down a game."  The three things holding me back from a higher rating are a long setup time, a playing time of more than 8 hours and gamey, radically ahistorical strategies exploited by a few card sharks.

I really have mixed feelings for this game. Some comments:

+ One can play this game so many times and every time it would have something new for you.
+ It is really a challenge and rather alike chess if one should make a comparison. 
+ The best player will win in the end although he/she may be unlucky with cards and dices at times
+ Great solitaire game
- There are so many exceptions and specials which means it is really an uphill task to just understand what one can/can not do. The game would win a lot through tidying this up. This also include the fact that often card B can only be played after card A. The game is not realistic anyhow (see below)
- The way that different cities connect to each other is just taken out of the blue and to make gameplay good.
- Like all card-driven cards, so much depends on what cards are drawn. I am not so happy with the haphazardness of this. I don't mind the dice-bit, as the outcomes of battles often are a bit uncertain.

Given that it takes 4-8 hours to play the game (based on your experience), I would actually expect a bit more of a game. I have played the game three times now and I have gotten solidly beaten every time. I am used to win games actually and be able to analyse what to do to win, but I still do not understand how to get a better outcome. I am intrigued in a way by the challenge but at the same time a bit exhausted as the game takes a lot of time. I have not decided whether I will want to take the enormous amount of time which it appears to require to master it better. Due to what I feel are a few fundamental flaws (mainly the number of exceptions), I don't think that I will ever rate it higher than 9 and I feel that there are better games around.

I have now reduced my rating from a "8" to a "7". The reason for that is the way that the cards interact with each other. I think that the text on the cards is not self-explanatory. It is also very complicated to understand the conditions to play many cards. A specific example from my game right now: I have held on to "Place of Execution" for two seasons to play it after Falkenheyn (without knowing that I first need to destroy the FR forts) and I have played Rathenau twice believing that AP first need to play a specific Total War game as an event before the card can nbe played as an event. Hence, AP has now reached Total War at least two seasons prior to CP. 

In my view, this type of card management does not improve the game. I know that one rationale for this is to get a game that is as authentic to history as possible. But so many aspects of the game are still so unauthentic so it just adds another barrier to understand how to play the game. It is better to simplify gameplay.

Paths of Glory permet de replonger dans la premi√®re guerre mondiale avec un volume de r√®gle relativement modeste et accessible. Ce fut en fait mon jeu d'initiation dans le wargame.
La quantit√© de pions est restreinte et le syst√®me de point √† point combin√© aux cartes permet une meilleure lecture strat√©gique ainsi qu'une v√©ritable immersion.

La tension est palpable et l'utilisation de chaque carte est un tiraillement.
Le jeu est plaisant et chaque partie fut diff√©rente, ce qui conf√®re au jeu une bonne rejouabilit√©.

Paths of Glory lets plunge into World War I with a volume of relatively small and accessible rule. It was actually my introduction into the game wargame.
The quantity of pieces is limited and the system point to point combined card enables better strategic reading and a real immersion.

The tension is palpable and the use of each card is pulling.
The game is fun and each game was different, which makes the game good replay value.

This game is very hard to rate for me.  As a game it is very good and the choices each player needs to make each turn can be very challenging. My problem is from a history standpoint with entire theaters sitting idle for a number of turns and one bad move can be the end of the game with no hope of salvaging a position.

I buyed it after having Triumph of Chaos. When I read about ToC, I seen it was based in the PoG system. Then I informed myself about PoG, and finally had it!
I think it is a very good game, combining cards and counters, and what that implies about your strategic and/or tactical decisions. If you use your tactical abilities on the map, maybe you will not be able to use your strategical and perhaps more decisive options in politics or deployment of units, and vice-versa. You must choose.

RATING: 7.8
A very exciting and tense game. Chief feature is the constant sense of needing to do more than you actually can in each action phase. Prioritisaton is therefore vital. Nicely balances the need to conduct operations with the need to arrange replacements and reorganize (strategically redeploy) your armies. As well as this, events need to be played to keep up the increases in your war status. The constant tension can leave you feeling exhausted. It is probably a good idea to play something else between plays of this. Supply rules are extremely harsh.

RATING: 7.5
The rules are not wonderful. While not broken by any means or fundamentally complex (there are basically 17 rules--not many for a war game), all of the exceptions, subtle variations, and special cases make this a game that is not for newbies, the faint of heart, or someone with a bad memory. I can't say that this is anything all that special. Unlike, say, Twilight Struggle, there are few cards that actually influence your opponent. Whilst it may be reflective of the actual war, not a lot really happened during my one play and the Near East Front was almost completely ignored.

Game plays at a huge scope and yet at the same time it's easy to take it all in. Rules are a great balance between complexity and playability. At about 20 pages they are much easier to digest than they first appear. 

Strategy wise players are not wed to any specific road to victory. While the Western and Eastern fronts are major areas of conflict in the game, as they were in the historical conflict, one can also make great strides towards victory in Turkey, Serbia or Italy.

Lastly the Card driven games Shifting Sands and Barbarossa to Berlin use very much the same system, so once you learn one you know 80% of the rules for any of the others.


Ranks as one of the best of the card driven games.

Fantastic!  Lots of fun and a real brain burner.  So much going on everywhere, so much to think about.  
Even though it is a CDG, the seperation of the decks, the division of the decks, and the balance of the cards (ops value vs. playing the event), is so well done that the luck-effect of card draw is minimal.  The combat tables have a fairly narrow spread also, making the dice a little less powerful (i.e. less chaotic and swingy in POG than they are in many other war game designs).  Super replayability.  I see why this a tournament favorite.  One of my absolute favorite war games.

Bought it when it first came out (1999).
Gave the rules a once through.
Set it up, pushed some pieces around but didn't really play.
Realized I probably never would.
Traded it away, reluctantly.
Occasionally thereafter would read good things about it.

(Several years pass, more than a decade in fact)

Impulsively acquired it again, in a trade (2015).

I'm constantly rating this one at the same level of his twin WW2, [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/3353/world-war-ii-barbarossa-berlin]Barbarossa to Berlin[/url]. As someone correctly stated, PoG' static complexity is in contrast to the overall fluid complexity of BtB; also, the map in PoG is absolutely better than BtB's.

It's a good game with pro and cons, yes it's more wide open than BtB (this also means, "less historical") but I find the baroque rulebook really hard to follow and remember, with a lot of sub-rules and exceptions: that was the way the things were done in the old days, I hoped that in the new millennium things could change for the better.

A great effort and a wonderful WW1 treatment, probably a classic, it's not flawless: but I love it.

After a hiatus from "boardgames" (unless you count MTG), I decided to start again with Guns of August.  After that I dove head first into the hobby with full vigor.  It is only fitting that I finally came around to experiencing Paths of Glory.  It is any excellent game and an improvement on Guns of August.

I have to rate this game highly, since I have played it many dozens of times, always with great enjoyment, and it has been excellent value for money.  Tense and gripping game-play, with lots for both players to do.  Unlike other games to which I would give a '9', however, I will almost certainly not play it again.  There are two reasons for this: 1) there are too many gamey tactics; and 2) I have come to find the numerous weaknesses of the game as history too intrusive.

Creates the most tension of any of the Card Driven games due to the severity of being Out of Supply.  Not forgiving of mistakes.

I really, really wanted this game to be as good as I thought it should be. I really wanted to like it. BUT it boils down to, that if I want to play this sort of card driven game, I'd much rather play a clean game like Twilight Struggle.
This has too many unnecessary rules written, that probably are there for historical reasons or flavor, but add nothing to the game. The game would lose absolutely nothing if these are removed.
The MEF rules. Why does a single unit have its own section?
Why are there separate supply rules for BR ANA, MN and SN units. MN is a single corps AND it has a separate rule for not needing supply, to mention but a few wierd rules.
While speaking of supply, does Italy really have to trace supply to London? How is this realistic? It also means that all those red squares hang by a thin thread connected through France, which is also dependent on London.

You really need to streamline these rules when designing games guys!

On another note, the out of supply rules mostly ruins the game. I've won and lost a game due to the harshness of OOS units, which mostly tends to end the game very early, and this doesn't seem to follow "The Great War"-feel.

Enjoyable and frustrating (in a positive sense). Agree with all the others who describe this as a game filled with "hard choices" - with so many possible options, most of them good ones, exactly what the "best" thing to do with your cards (ops? events? SR? replacements?) quickly turns into a tense little drama. 

Some have complained that it's difficult (or, perhaps, unrewarding) to play "historically" (US entry & Bolshevik Revolution are rare, and many have pointed to the "Italian Strategy"). It's a fair critique, but one that doesn't bother me too much. Perhaps that will change with time. Either way the opprobrium the game has earned from some quarters on this score seems a bit overwrought, especially since there are lots of variants available.

My larger problem is with the rules, which even after several editions, remain dense and poorly organized. (Most) everything seems to be in there, but finding it is often a challenge -- a good example of where having PDF rules with a search function for ease of reference is very desirable. 
 
In my opinion, it's by no means the "best wargame ever made" or "an absolute must-have in any wargame collection." But I do think it's a game that is, for the most part, quite deserving of the praise it gets and I'm certainly glad to own it.

Interesting game, completely fails as a simulation. Decisions made by the players are completely arbitrary in their nature (do I attack Verdun or recruit Cossacks ?) and in their consequences.

Tried this twice; the first game was quickly terminated when we realized we'd gotten the supply rules wrong, the later abandoned in the midgame (early 1916 I think) when the Central Powers had conquered Russia up the supply areas in the southern and central sectors, yet a Russian capitulation was a long way off due too few event cards played. I feel no particular wish to try it again, particularly as I don't think the whole card-based thing is really my cup of tea.

One of the best games I've played. All of the "card angst" in the world. It really captures the FEEL of the times like so many of the other great CDGs do. For those historicity nit-pickers who claim it's not historical, well, they might be right, but if you want pure historical accuracy then read a book. The game play is what makes this game so great. And, even if the game doesn't play out historically, it does bring to light most of the aspects of WWI even if in an abstract way. Yes, the supply rules can be unforgiving, but that's just one more aspect to the game in which you must cover your ass. In the real war supply was everything. Both sides outran their supply lines and offensives ground to a halt. Russia was demolished several times by being cut off and isolated. Truly a gem of a game.

Basically, both BtB and PoG are fine games (both by Racier). If you want a fast, dynamic front, go with BtB, if you want a slower, more classic front, go with PoG.  Both are worthy of purchase.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Rating very provisional.

PoG is a strategic level CDG wargame of the Great War in Europe and the Middle East. 

I have barely played the game enough to understand the outline of the rules, let alone have a hint of strategy. No doubt this is affecting my enjoyment significantly. It is a hard game to grasp without intimate knowledge of the flow of play and of the cards themselves. There is a degree of Catchb-22 here: it's a tough game.

Lots of intense decisions in this well balanced two player strategy game.  Luck isn't a very large factor and dice rolls seldom result in unexpected results.

The pressure of handling multiple fronts provides intra-game variety. It's too long and too complex to get a lot of replay in my neck of the woods, but I thorougly enjoyed each playing I've had.

I bought this on the back of buying and playing the excellent "Shifting Sands", which uses the same system. Although I've only played a solo game so far, I'm reading the players guide and am intigued by the German players need to balance Ops points between the eastern and western fronts. Not a pick-up-and-play wargame, but that's not a bad thing.

I have played many games of this using ACTs.  It does tend to bog down a bit in the middle, but then, so did the conflict it simulates.  Strategies have become a bit ossified, but it is still fun.

I used to own it, but sold the game years ago.  The CDG genre is very unsatisfying for me.  I've played just one too many of these where the extremes of card draws has completely ruined the game.  I'll certainly play this game, but I don't need it on my own shelf.

EDIT: Well as of 2/20/08 I own this one again.  PBEM has me involved with this game again, and I'm trying to give the CDG stuff another go.  My new approach is to focus on deck trimming during play to weed out low OPS cards.

I'm enjoying this one much, much more.  I took the AP in my first game back and stuck with it despite terrible (no even worse than you think) luck with the dice.  Prudent play won out over bad luck - to me that's a sign of a good game.

A ground-breaking game of WWI, but it never seemed to produce a satisfactory game for me. The western trenches were too easy for the Allies to break through unless the Central Powers withdrew to a short frontier within Germany. Also Italy joining the war was a definite boon for the CPs as they knew it must happen and tended to have an army or two waiting to mash the half strength Italian armies and take northern Italy. I did come up with some house rules, but gave up in the end and got rid. A pity in some ways.

Played seven times, one very long game ending in a draw, one even longer game ending in an Allied win by concession, and  two Central Power autovictories and one Allied win by concession in August 1914  and Winter 1915 (the Allied win was in Winter 1915, the two CP wins were one in each month) one Allied win by concession in Spring 1916 and one game ended in 1916 cause the Allied player had to leave.

I really want to like this game, but I don't. It feels too daft that you can make the British army attack twice as effectively by (say) keeping Romania neutral and playing the card as offensives. That just wrecks the feel of the game, and makes it feel arbitrary and unhistorical.

Got to admit - it's growing on me a little with another play. Now I'm thinking of it as an abstract card game of politics in the First World War with a military side show, it's much more fun.

Never rated a game before, but this is simply crying for a 10. Best game of the last decade. Great tactics and strategy. Sound gameplay overcomes bad dice - great for a wargame. Only drawback (not for me) might be game-length. Difficult to play in one evening session. So find a place to leave it between sessions and be happy. Great nerve wrecking decisions.

RATING: 9
Very addictive and interesting game.  When you start a new game you will not want to stop until the game is finished.  Very easy to learn also.  The game of year edition also offers one of the very best player aid.  I do not give it a 10 is based on 3 rather subjective reasons.  First, I am not very familiar with WWI and although I know the gameplay functions of the event cards I do not really know what the historical events the card actually represent.  The rule book gives a very very brief history about the name of each card that hardly teach me anything.  Second, although it is a very good game I cannot consider it as a war game.  The restriction of the game is based more on card picking than the war situation.  You can actually considered it as a 10-times-more-complicated-Memoir' 44.  Lastly, because of the limitation of actions in each round, some fronts rarly have anything goining on.  For the same reason, I rarely is able to kick Russia out of the game, or to bring USA in the game.

Grand, exciting game, the kind that actually takes a while to play but doesn't seem to.

I don't know if its the game system or the characteristics of the conflict it aims to simulate (WWI), but Paths of Glory nails it for me. Be it as the Allies or the Central Powers and you will always be on the edge of the seat, threading a fine line between  decisive breakthrough and utter collapse. 

The Out of Supply rules are merciless but they are key to simulate the sluggish aspect of the conflict. 

Only two things nag me in PoG. It is a rather fiddly game - plenty of things to keep track of and some rule exceptions for the sake of realism. And, most of all, the epic gameplay time - a full campaign can go to some 6-7 hours if it goes all the way to 20 turns.

Still, the definite card-driven wargame for me.

Reading the 2004 rules: wow, what a tedious rulebook; far far too many exceptions, special rules, and some vagueness. Exceptions prevent this from being an 'elegant' design and are certainly imposed to force 'historic' play.

1 Intro Scenario play was unappealing. Too much space, too little action (cards should have split OP/Events for W & E fronts for about double the activity) and the rules are terrible. Nevertheless, the limited actions should make this a fast playing game .... except for the rules. Too much depends on too few die rolls and the Supply rules are too draconian and can lead to very gamey situations. Some degree of free setup would also help. I can see where a lot of thought could be applied to various strategies etc but I'm just not into CDG games. (I'll admit I played poorly.)

Enjoy the way it plays - rapidly becoming one of my favorite card driven games - rivaling Hannibal.
The divided deck, which gradually becomes available - drives the game in a historical way without putting you in a straight jacket. 
The game provides a lot of options for both players. For the allies which fronts to open, and attacks to bleed the CP especially Austria. For the CP to you try to knock Russia out or France out.

I always play with Raicer's historical variant. I feel it balances the game (Italians are stronger on defense), and the Guns of August - without the Schiefflen Plan it isn't WWI.
Do like some of the variants where cards that set up future events like Russia falling and the US coming in can be played like the "yellow" cards in BtB.

A card driven game for the first wotrd war is just a great idea...nevertheless the suplly rules are a nightmare for any serious strategy player. Once a unit is out of supply it cannot do any action and is eliminated in the end of a turn....this is by far too much for a game on that scale...it could mean that the whole front is endangered of being eleminated or even both sides have to eleminate nearly all of their troops....this is also called "the dance of death"....just ridiculous....I recommend a house rule for the harsh supply rules!!! With that the game is really fun to play!!!

Unlike my favourite CDG, Wilderness War, it is almost chess-like with optimal moves and grand strategies (a bit like Diplomacy). And with so many fronts, there's so much to take in! 

But it's incredibly well designed, if a little long for my tastes. I can't play ftf longer than 4 hours, and this can take more than double this time.  Still, great event cards and lots of difficult choices make this one of the better wargames I've played. Luckily, it's also brilliant on ACTS. I think I've only played my "hard copy" once.

Basic mechanic is like other card driven wargames, with ops/replacement/reinforcement point and an event--of course, you only get to execute one... resolving movement, reinforcements, attacks/retreats, and so on are straightforward... that said, there are tons of decision points, so don't fall victim to analysis paralysis... oh yeah, watch the supply chains--units cut off at the end of the turn are eliminated... rating is based on the first play--abbreviated 3-turn scenario--and will certainly go up at the next session...

An absolutely fantastic game. Some of the rules and their exceptions can be a bit daunting at first but once you've played a game or two they are no longer a problem. The ulcer inducing tension of trying to decide what to do on each and every turn is constant and you always feel that you are just one move away from astounding victory or abject defeat at the same time.

Brilliant game Of WWI.  The cards are the weak link in my opinion - I do not like having to juggle the war status points - makes the experience very gamey.  The way pieces move or attack means that there is never a surprise - you only get assaulted if you choose to get assaulted.  The game can be very unstable - I have never had a game go the distance.  This relates to the supply rules mainly and makes the game somewhat dodgy history.  HOWEVER it makes it a brilliant game as it is incredibly tense which is not a bad effort for a WWI game.  By clever damage systems, battles on the West Front can be static and attritional while in the Near East and East the battles can be fluid and dynamic.  I love it, but it does seem best played using ACTS and cyberboard as it is (a) very long 8-12 hours at least; and (b) because it is unstable, some time to carefully consider each move is a good thing.  The non-interactive turn sequence makes PBEM very easy.

Paths of glory is a simulation game covering World War I in Europe and the Middle-East. It is a combination of map and counter and card game, with cards being played for special events and to provide movement points for units.
This game is long and medium-heavy in its complexity. The cards are not really used to simplify the rules of a hevier wargame but just to add in special events (which is a slight downside). On the other hand the game always has lots of things going on to stretch the players to try and manage a variety of different fronts.
I slightly dislike the way action points are used in the game. The mechanic of having X points with which to activate units in a turn is well-used in wargames, but it doesn't work well with multiple fronts. Why should the German army using precious resources on the Western Front deprive the Turkish of supplies needed to operate their railways? It feels like an inappropriate abstraction for this particular game.
That however is a minor point. The main problem for most people will be the length of the game. I wonder if it can be deliberately speed played, and get it down to four hours, but even so that would still be a long game. Though as a large scale operational game about multiple fronts it is still excellent.

At this point though I am dropping my rating for the game. I think after awhile this game lends itself too much to deck management and card counting. Since this game has come out I think that the COIN series card decks have done a better job of presenting the essence of a conflict without feeling railroaded into the timeline of historical events. I would like to see a new version of this game which is a little more open ended in terms of events, relooked at the limited and total war mechanic, and change the card driven mechanic so that experienced players were not playing the deck. 
With that being said, I still think this is a great game full of hard decisions and contains many hours of great play. I still recommend someone to buy and enjoy the game. 


09/07/2011 Awesome game. I like the card driven system and the fact that you can never get everythign you want done done in asingle turn. No two games have ever played out the same that I have played. 
Downside, I have never seen Russia Collapse or American Entry into the war. I also have the great war deluxe and once I play that i am curious as to how the two games will compare.

CDG with a lot of chrome. Played a couple of solo games when first getting into wargaming. It looks like a game designed more for balanced gameplay than a true historical simulation. There is a variant that is supposed to play more historical, which I should probably try out. 

For me, it probably won't get much play going forward because it likely won't provide the historicity that I'm looking for solo and it's too heavy to try to get a non-wargamer to play.

The most rewarding and complete (both in terms of theme and mechanisms) game experience I have ever had is by playing this outstanding game.

Even if it is difficult to master the rules and the various fine points and exceptions in the beginning, 
once you become familiar with the system, the game plays very well and provides you with tens of options for tactical and strategical moves. 

Playing time is not an issue for me, taking into consideration the quality of the game and the total gaming experience. 

I look forward to play again.

RATING: 6
This has the feel of a flawed masterpiece. There is much to love about the game: the activation system, the low counter density, the relative simplicity of the rules, the concept of war status, a representation of attritional combat which is actually quite exciting, the need to shift your attention from front to front. However, I don't like the way that Italy, Turkey and Russia are dealt with in the game, which also seems to be needlessly stacked against the Central Powers. 

I have just read about the historical variants. I probably should try the game again with one of those.

I'm glad I can finally rate this one and was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed it, despite hearing a lot about gamey tactics (which I have tried to ignore as I get to know the game). Tense, flavorful, fun. I love the corps rules, dislike the overly harsh supply ones. 

My biggest problem is that troops are static unless there is card play. This can lead to whole fronts having nothing happen on them, while in the real war, lots happened at once on most fronts. This can be countered by saying the time scale for the game need not correspond exactly with reality, or that static fronts do have conflict on them, it's just under the radar of the game, but I don't like it. As another poster on a discussion board recently said, troops have doctrine, which means they will do things on their own without directive from the card-player.

An idea is to give a neglected some 1 OP turns when cards are played on the other front, or something like that, although this would throw the game's time scale off and throw off the reinforcement systems, etc.

Does a good job of mixing historical events with the freedom to follow a different historical path. It's an engaging game that doesn't make you have to chase answers in the rule book too often. Every turn is chocked full of tough decisions and a multitude of options. Fun. The full game runs rather long, but there's a shortened version that means you can play it in an evening. I wouldn't mind getting my hands on a mounted map. The opening three or four turns for the Germans can be the most important of the game - without a good knock against the French it'll be hard to divert German resources over to the east where their superior firepower will be needed to make decent inroads on that front.

RATING: 7
I am just not a big fan of this game.  I dislike the theme, which alone may be too much to overcome.  Its too early to throw in the towel though because I want to like the game.  I think it just has a steep learning curve and takes more plays than other games to really enjoy it like the ratings suggest.

I feel it spreads the player too thin, you have the hand management on top of too big a play area.  Just too many options and too many fronts.  I keep asking myself "what do I do with these units?".  Turkey and Eastern Europe come to mind. I don't see the decision making that others talk about as a strength, I feel the game more or less plays you. Other CDG's do a much better job in my opinion at hand management.  It tries to be a block AND CDG and I would just rather one or the other.

I absolutely hate the OOS rules, one error can effectively end the game.  More playing has not changed my thoughts about the game and I just cannot imagine myself sitting down to play a FtF game, its strictly a PBEM for me.

Reminds me of PvP Starcraft in that it shrinks into a tiny box of an exacting build and play order. In the extended example of play, the play of two inexperienced players is documented and the designer injects his commentary and you can almost hear him going, "LOL! What a bunch of newbies!" It doesn't get much more sharky than this. No thanks.

A fantastic 2-player game that grows richer with each play.  The sides are fairly evenly matched and most tournament games have been reduced to a standard 2VP bid for the allies.  The thing I really like about this game is that the best players normally win.  Not always an easy thing to do with a CDG.  The only downside is the long playing time and steep learning curve, but neither particularly bother me.

RATING: 8
First CDG I played, and I can't help feeling that another long obsession with the game is just around the next corner. No other CDG gives such immediate and difficult choices with every card - and you'll play 100 or more of them. Only downsides are the historical giggle factor, and game length. A genuine classic - most likely "board wargame" to endure, IMO.

There was a lot to like when this came out - it seemed to take CDG design to a new level.  After a few games the shine came off in a hurry.  Parts of it are still brilliant, but true grand strategy in this game requires deck manipulation at a level that makes me extremely uncomfortable and feels very gamey.  In addition, more than once over the game's life serious changes have been issued to deal with the game breaking.  It's a decent game, but not what I'm looking for in CDGs anymore.  I think it's biggest crime is that it has influenced recent CDG design in all the wrong ways (overscripted deck manipulation overwhelms board/hand interaction).

El primer wargame he catado de la "nueva hornada" despu√©s de la √©poca dorada de los 90.

La mec√°nica de CDG me parece brillante, ya que incorpora en una carta todas aquellas excepcions que normalmente en los wargames manchan las p√°ginas del reglamento.

Percibo un problema con el juego, y es que el desarrollo del mismo, e incluso la duraci√≥n de la partida depende de los jugadores, pudi√©ndose dar el caso con jugadores muy agresivos en que la partida termine muy pronto, sin posibilidad de explorar todas las opciones estrat√©gicas- Por lo dem√°s, un grand√≠simo juego y un digno ocupante del trono de los wargames en la lista de la BGG.

RATING: 8
The [b]Paths of Glory[/b] system is a fork of the [b]We the People[/b] system. This game has serious issues with realism, but as a well‚Äìdesigned card driven game it weaves a rich and wonderful narrative of the First World War. The Western Front is portrayed beautifully, with the French struggling to counter the German juggernaut without trenches. Late war cards allow the Entente Allies to finally break the stalemate. Some allied progress can be (slowly) made in the Near East, except for an amphibious landing in Gallipoli, which is such a bad idea nobody would do it. Serbia is as tough as ever, and the Austro‚ÄìHungarians will need German support to defeat them.

The Eastern Front has implausibly little room to manoeuvre, despite it's vast scale. Potentially war-changing but historical side-issues, such as the Arab Campaign (Card No. 41: Arab Northern Army), aren't really explored, being represented by shallow mechanics that make little sense. The sea war isn't explored at all, but arguably the Germany Navy being forced to stay at port was inevitable, given the disparity in sea power.

Perhaps most egregiously, the game does not simulate the harshness of the British blockade (Card No. 02: Blockade), which was slowly starving Germany into ruin and ensured they had few if any supplies to mount a successful offensive. However, this was probably done for the sake of balance. For all its flaws, it tells a grand story of the Great War.

RATING: 9.01399
I love historical games and card-driven games.  It seems to be about as good as advertised.  The game seems to be holding up well considering that it's over 10 years old now.  I guess the rules aren't quite as complicated as I suspected, but it can still be quite tough as long two-player wargames can be a beast for novice-type wargamers.

The game seems to be all about supply lines and very tough decisions.  If your counters are out of supply at any point, they are paralyzed until the end of the turn and then removed from the board unless you somehow can rescue them before the last card is played that turn.  Talk about brutal!  It reminds me of certain strategic-level American Civil War games where the Yankees and Confederates are fighting around this tight area in Northern Virginia as the Germans and French fight entrenched along their boundary while the rest of the map is wide open for lots of maneuvering.  (There are Level 1 and Level 2 trenches; each level pushes the dice back over one column on the CRT.)  Apparently one trick of the game is that both players don't want their allies to enter the game; the Ottoman Empire and Italy (and to some extent Romania) leave lots of victory point control areas easily exposed once they enter the game while only providing very small military forces.    
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This is in every way an amazing game experience.

Every move counts, every decision weighs hard and you really feel the breeze of history (though a few things are not so historical, like Bulgarian units entering Turkey).

My best wargaming experience so far. I highly recommend using Jeremy Kalgreens alternate map (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/27629/updated-paths-of-glory-alternative-map-v1-2) and playing with the tournament rules which evens play balance and makes russian revolution and american intervention more likely.

Never have I though being miserable for this long would be so much fun.  Every choice is agonizing.  This is about as good as a wargame gets for me.  Elegant system, great hand management, constant stress, yet it doesn't feel chaotic.  Perfectly captures the horror of WWI.

The only reason why I don't give this a 10 outright is that I don't think Turkey is very fun.  You could argue that the game clearly wasn't designed for your pleasure, but running crap troops through the irritating terrain of Turkey just gives me no amount of joy that the rest of the game yields.  I will have to get over it though as Turkey is pretty damned important.

I think it is the greatest in "the card driven series" that I've played.

Now my favourite CDG - beating Hannibal: Rome vs Carthage and Twilight Struggle.

Wow, very good game! I'm not sure how to rate this one, though! It seems like a terrific design: very nice deck setup (staged, like Twilight Struggle, but each player has their own deck), tough board play (don't get out of supply!!), always feel like you can't do everything you want to do! The multiuse cards are great, forcing you do decide when to use the event (and remove them in the deck -- LOTS of these type!) or which part of the card to use otherwise (ops or replacement points). The pressure of maintaining a front line, maneuvering to keep in supply, while still taking a few VP here and there and not letting your forces get totally destroyed ... it's great! 

But on the other hand, I simply will not play this "any time"! It's just too long for that! Plus, there are a LOT of exceptions -- I'm sure I don't know more than a tiny fraction of them! And the board design, especially with having to deal with stupid chits and fat fingers, is more than a little annoying! Couldn't the Under Siege and Destroyed Fort markers be bigger or more distinctive? Wouldn't it be easier if the board were a touch bigger?

So on the BGG scale, this would probably be around 6.5 for me. But the quality of the game would suggest closer to 8+? So I guess I'll go with a 7.5 ....

Damn it, it's been over a week and I'm still kind of thinking about this one! Maybe my personal rating should be something a bit higher?

Or rather 1,5 plays. The first time we hade to end it half-way. The reason? It a rather long game. The second time we succeed to end it in just under 12 hours. That‚Äôs a whole day of gaming, but it was 12 hours of good gaming experience. It captured the feeling of the WW1, the insane "we have to attack! But it is suicide? We HAVE to!" Minor drawbacks are the victory point system that sets too much focus on the minor fronts - Italy and Turkey. As I played the central powers it felt rather silly that after having forced the Russian to leave the war in beginning of 1918 I had to focus in Turkey and Italy to have a chance to win the game rather than on the west front because of the number of victory points on each front. I lost by one point when Italy the last round, the last turn liberated Venice from AH. A tense game with a good feeling to it but rather long.

Only played once in an unfinished game. It seemed to be a terrific game. Maybe the best wargame I've ever played. Loved every second of it. Simple rules, short turns, a bit of analysis paralysis but it really worth the effort. Can't wait to give it another try.

I've already played a couple of games more. It's not very relevant if you dominate the deck, as in Twilight Struggle for example, it's much more important to dominate the map. Players should always be very careful with all the positions occupied in the map because of supply. Supply really was a major issue in WWI and PoG puts this concern into a total different perspective.

The system is really easy to get into it doesn't have a colossal rulebook nor is it unplayable without experience. It's a kind of perfect introductory game for real and non-real wargamers because it can easily be played by wargame's newbies. 

The map is very well designed but sometimes the countries borders are not easy to see.

Positions seem balanced, although the Allies apparently have some advantage. One of my major goals for this new year is to play a full game of PoG because until now I've only lasted a few turns.

This is one of the games of my life.

My first GMT game, and it continues to be my favorite game. It's the game that has me doing the most contemplating between sessions, and it motivated me to learn more about European history from the 1870s to 1930s.
 The rules exceptions are a bit daunting, and keep me from giving the game a 10, but they do make sense after getting used to the game and don't really involve a lot of game-breaking moments if you forget one, at least at the level I play at, which includes only playing solo.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I would love to have a free week to really get to know this game. The CDG agony of Ops v Event is magnified here because there are more options (reinforcement and Strategic move) and you want to do all of them all of the time. The game comjures the death grip the combatants had each other in, with a feeling that if you do anything other than focus on the front you are letting your opponent gain game winning initiative.

Rating this game makes me realize the Geek rating definitions need work.  I KNOW this game is better than a "2."  There's definitely quality here.  But it's so far removed from my taste that I don't want to play it again.  Any rating of 3+ states I might be tempted to play again, and that's simply not going to happen.  I guess I'm forced to rate it on taste instead of being able to rate it on quality.

RATING: 8.5
Provisional rating...I'm finally attacking this game after trying some of its kids.  I greatly enjoyed my first game, and can see where some of the odd-seeming rules in some other games came from (imported lock, stock, and barrel from PoG, of course!).

New CDGs are, of course, always really fun.  So this rating may go down, though given the enthusiasm most wargamers have for the title it may also go up!

UPDATE:  OK, this game is AWESOME.  I've never played a CDG where I felt so reluctant to play each card for operations.  And the War Status element of the game is terrific.  It's superior to its children that I've tried (ToC, SS) and probably the best CDG I've ever played.

I'm still just getting going in the game and have tons more to discover, and I'm looking forward to it...

SECOND UPDATE:  Still awesome, but running into some of the "history vs. game" problems that others have mentioned.  We are experimenting with some of the scenarios that seek to remedy these problems but still loving the gameplay.

THIRD UPDATE:  Downgrading it 0.5 to reflect the fact that one of its children (Pursuit of Glory) has surpassed it in my play preferences, for now at least.  It's fun to explore the "play space" of a game, and I came to POG too late to get to do much of that myself.  I'm really enjoying the blank canvas of PuG.

RATING: 9
THE quintessential World War One game. Only problem are some quirky history twists (I've yet to see Russia fall in any game, and the Americans are too often AWOL) - play with the designer's Historical Variant (which allows for certain Russian and U.S. cards to be played for both OPs and Events), and this game is nearly perfect.

PoG is highly addictive and just plain fun (and very tense) to play. But then it's not quite history.

Paths of Glory is a fantastic game.  Almost infinite replayability, great balance, immersive gameplay, great production, and so much more.  It's a game I am always willing to play.  Ted Racier really did a great job designing this game.  For those that enjoy World War One, this game is a must!

I own the Paths of Glory Player's Guide.

On the Guide: The strategy articles are a fun read, but the real gold of this book is all the historical scenarios!  They really let you shorten the game time, or look at certain points in time that normally would be glazed over in the scope of a complete campaign game.

Let me get my historical critique out of the way: this game will not teach you a lot about the history of how WW1 evolved and happened. Random stuff happens all over with no rhyme or reason. (Hey, much like Twilight Struggle.) 

Now, as a game... this is an awesome game. I thought for sure it'd have stilted play, but the ahistorical nature of things (cough) makes for a fun game every time you play. (Or at least it has, for me.) 

This belongs on every gamer's shelf. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Outstanding WWI card-driven wargame. It feels genuinely authentic as the various fronts become static due to entrenchment and the nations search for whatever gains they can in search of victory points. The cards that drive the game are multi-purpose and can be used for operation points for movement and combat, strategic redeployment points to move armies and corps greater distances, event triggers which bring added historical flavour, and replacement points to bring extra troops into the game. As a player you really feel up against it as you try to strike a balance between taking advantage of your combat opportunities in order to gain ground and attempting to bring more forces into the game. Supply can also be brutal and any advancement has to be mindful of this because once supply lines are cut you're in deep trouble because getting them back is far from easy. Movement is point-to-point, which works really well on a game of this scale and the map design is fantastic, really doing the game justice. Overall the scope for 'PoG' is enormous. It's a hugely ambitious game and it delivers on everything it sets out to achieve.

It's like the first world war I game that doesnt suck the life out of you. The card mechanics are very innnovative with the various decks that relate to differnent time periods of the war. That much is very clever and by itself warrants a "6" at least. However I dont like 8 hour games about anything so this is not one for me. Also other then the card decks, the rest of the game seems quite conventional wargame far. There are stacks of units, they have combat/movement factors, etc. It's pt to pt not hexes, but otherwise seems conventional which is kind of odd given the clever aspects. While it's not the first, the card management system is also a blast again warrants positive rating.

Played it a lot before designing my own WWI game (Death in the Trenches) to replace it. Fun "game" but awful as a historical simulation. Suffers from the two-front CDG problem, e.g. the French sit around doing nothing because the Russians are playing all the cards. The chess-like gambits and opening moves (e.g. "The Dance of Death") described in the player's guide positively revel in gameyness and fakery. Still infinitely better than WWII: Barbarossa to Berlin, its misbegotten offspring.

One of the best ways to spend  8-12 hours. It'd get a 10 if not for the length. But I love the ebb and flow of this game as well as the tough choices that must be made such as investing in the long game or trying to close out a short game.

Plays a little fast-and-loose with history, but manages to hit the broad strokes very well.  Why is the war focussing around Italy and Turkey just because they happen to be the weakest?  Why is it so hard to beat the Russians and/or get the Americans into the war?  Once you get past this, however, you start to realize the value of things like attrition, supply, and balancing multiple fronts all at the same time.  A well played game of PoG is a fantastic gaming experience.

CDGs fascinate me and there are not that many in German. WWI is a theme I am interested in, because it often is dwarfed by WWII themes and the imperial times are just very fascinating for me. With stukajoes method for solo play, this got even more interesting. Additionally, this game has sandbox characteristocs and allows quite a bit of alt-history experimentation, which I often prefer over scripted historicity.

While the game itself has all of the normal expectations of a wargame, with various units, CRT charts and period chrome, at heart the game rests within the card play. Players are given a hand of cards to play out six sub-phases of a turn. Each sub-phase allows for the use of a card or a pass with a minimal movement of units. Each card has four possible uses: operational movement, strategic movement, special events, and replacement points. The cardplay forces players to constantly make tough decsions as they feel that they need to do a little bit of everything but they can only do one thing at a time. How you play your cards will decide to a large degree the outcome of the war.

POG is probably one of the best card driven games in the market. I have revisited the game twice in March 07. Central power won both games.

German sent reinforcements from the West front to destory Italy completely. There are so many VPs in Italy!

A very solid card-driven WWI from GMT. A classic that combines the World-beating engine with First World War. One of the few choices for those into Great War, also a great introduction into "slightly heavier" wargames for those moving on from RISK and AXIS.

Once I let the Italians enter the front I was heavily disappointed. What happened to the Isonzo-front? Austrians simply walked over the Italians.

For a game which takes so many hours to play and pretends to follow historic events a major letdown.

RATING: 6
I find myself consistently comparing this with [gameid=6205], one of my favorite long two-player wargames.  PoG perhaps unfairly suffers as a result.  There's always more to do with my cards than I can ever manage.  The biggest drawback of this game is not a property of the game itself, but instead the war that it simulates.  Because World War I was so stagnant, the game situation on the board tends to look rather stagnant as well.  A major offensive gains a few spaces, and it's counted a great success.  Contrast this to grand strategic simulations of WWII or Napoleonic-era wars with seemingly unstoppable campaigns through entire continents.  By comparison, PoG seems quite pedestrian.

 I had never tackled a *true* war game before, and after the failure of Twilight Struggle (which is also a card driven game) to excite me I was doubtful of whether PoG could really do it for me. Well, it totally did (although not until my second abbreviated game did I "see the light"). PoG does everything cool that I could imagine a war game doing- the tension and angst are totally there, the grand scale and managing different fronts are there in spades! it is just a majestic experience and really the learning curve is not that bad at all IF someone is teaching you. I look forward to more plays!

RATING: 6
Only played once, imo it takes too long (well its already relatively short), but it will never suit Taiwanese living pace. We simply won't have ten hours playing a game. However, the gameplay overall is fun, it doesn't get duplicated, it doesn't repeat same things over and over again. It has events, it is perfect, only it doesn't suit here.

RATING: 8
Lots of time and patience necessary to learn and play this one, but worth it.  Can get tense at time.  I don't fully understand how some cards work together, but more plays will help that.  Many exceptions to try to remember.

This game taught me everything I know about the First World War, and a great deal of what I know about war in general.  I wish I'd had this game when I was doing my GCSEs.  Utterly absorbing, and the economy of resource (a maximum of five attacks a turn, if you're not saving or moving men around) provokes a depth and subtlety of strategy which you don't get in the 'move every piece every turn' school of wargames.  Everything about it works perfectly.  Just the right amount of rules complexity - any more and it would be offputting.  And a great opportunity to put the Theme from Lawrence of Arabia on when the Arab Northern Army gets played.

Definitely more moving parts than BtB, and it feels quite different.  Inexperienced at this point, but some very difficult choices are presented. There are a few "must play" events, which is unfortunate, but after playing Shifting Sands a couple of times I'll cut PoG some slack on that front.  Overall, though, just a great game, with unbelievable card angst.

RATING: 9
My respect for this game just continues to grow each time I play it. The 2010 edition is really beautiful. Even though I have serious complaints about US entry, the Russian Revolution, and the treatment of Italy, the tense quality of game play is only equalled by that in Victory Games "The Civil War." Paths of Glory ranks right up there alongside that game as one of the two best 2-player strategic cardboard wargames of all time. I want to play this game another couple of dozen times.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Best WWI treatment I've yet come across.  Card-driven aspect means you can't do everything, but there are still ways to score points, even when the trenches bog down the front.  All aspects of the war evolve somewhat naturally through the three decks - Mobilization, Limited War and Total War, including entry of new nations, and the eventual overthrow of the Czar, and Treaty of Brest-Litovsk.

RATING: 7
One of the few activation system based games I like. The cards do not drive the game as they do in some titles. And the initiative issue is very much in keeping with the events of the actual war in question. Though it seems the western allies should not impact the russians, it was common historically for there to be utterly disjointed operations that impact initiative this way. This works well because of that. This title got me reading up on WWI again after years of not paying much attention to warfare in that period. I still dislike activation systems because it means only some of the forces in your control are actually in your control. The games activation systems work with are few and far between.

Absolutely love it. I am a huge fan of the time period and of WW1. This is one of the CDGs where it really feels like you need to do everything with every card and just can't find enough time in each hand.

I just wish that sometimes there was a reason to play cards as events once you got to TW, other then to burn your deck.

Interesting 2-player CDG, one play only so far, so grading very tentative. Most interest differences to other 2-player CDGs I‚Äôve played are (1) the importance put on manouevering to put units out of supply (OOS) and thereby eliminate them, and (2) deck management: cycling decks through, cycling certain cards out by playing them as events rather than for the OPs, and (3) that the game doesn‚Äôt take care of reinforcements for you (by scripting the number of units you get and where you get them), aka the RP/SR system where you first have to create numbers to re-inforce and then have to remote-send them where you want (the latter rather unnecessary in the early rounds of the game). As of now I won‚Äôt expect it to soon become a personal favourite, but I guess the more familiar one is with the game the more the long term stakes impress themselves on one, this raising the tension the game is famous for (and which I hardly experienced so far). Final Note: Playing with the 8-card-hand optional rule (which we did) means the decks cycle extra fast when not using the extra cards shipped with the Player‚Äôs Guide. These extra cards are latter strangely not included in the Deluxe version of the game I own, in marked contrast to the goodies GMT added to their other 2010 deluxe reprints (cf. 2-player deck in HiS, and 5th-player-deck in Sword of Rome).

I've yet to play a CDG that i did not like but this is my favorite of them all. Each player has their own deck which alleviates the terrible(but sometimes fun) problem of dealing with all the bad cards you are dealt. But even still you will never have enough good cards to do all the necessary actions you might require. 
While the war itself might be an attritional stalemate, the cardplay is very dynamic in which initiative is seized back and forth. Well worth any effort it takes to learn.

Complex.  Gutwrenching.  Rewards inventive, competent gambits.  Multi-faceted.  Brutal.  After one play, one of my favorite games.  My only concern regards the historicity of the game, and I'm anxious to try the 'Historical' variant which reputedly increased the game's simulationist value.

This is the highest rated game I own so I didn't rate it because I don't want to bring it down.  However, I have some real problems with the out of supply rules.  They seem to create all sorts of silliness that I'd rather avoid.  Also Italy being the "easy meat" for victory seems silly as well.

Basically good game but I'm obviously missing something.

One of my three favourite wargames. It virtually should get a "10" rating, but I am loathe to do so, because I would have liked the cards to have more respect for the naval war. Even a few more naval cards would have added a lot more flavour to the game. Still, one can't argue with success. This is one of the best strategic games on the Great War.

OK, it's the best WW1 wargame out there, but things can get to the stage where both players just have to keep attacking to try to mend holes in the front. Soon, there are so many holes that units wander around in each other's rear and it all gets a bit silly.

We've just started playing this evening and have made it to the end of Turn 2 without making too many mistakes. So far we've really enjoyed it and don't expect this to change. One small gripe: the rulebook could be better written. For example, there are too many rules buried away in large blocks of text.  Just   finished it... really enjoyed it!  Excellent game... would like to try some of the variants for our next go.

Love this game.  I made my own markers for this, having a great time doing so.  I made MANY more territory markers, and a bunch of markers to help me remember the 1914 special rules (e.g., 'can't attack this space or fortress'.  So, I would have marked it a 9 because it did not have enough markers, but I had so much fun creating my own markers that I had to upgrade it to a 10.  Just ridiculously fun to play.  My only complaint is that I can't play it enough, which is really just another reason to call it a 9 or 10. And, my main opponent (my son) has moved away to university, again downgrading my PoG playing time....

This is a a great card driven war game.  Even though this is WW1, there is a lot of action throughout the game.  The game captures the historical events well.

Rules are straightforward although there are many exception, but many of them don't really come into play much.

Some say the game is not realistic, which may well be true. But it is lively. It paints a vivid picture of the Great War with a clean set of rules.

Have the 2010 copy now, and happy with the mounted map board, and all the errata in the rulebook. The rule book is cleaned up a bit, and much easier to understand and play. Love the game flow and the tension it creates. Every move is important and thus is a game that you need to take your time with.

RATING: 8
WWI in a box ‚Äì don't look further. A study in trenches. Pretty complicated and hard to learn due to exceptions (WWII: Barabarossa to Berlin is actually better in this aspect but went under the radar and has uncomplete rulebook accompanied with no support at all, whereas PoG had many editions and errors were fixed, dilemmas resolved), but rewarding. Simulates stalemates on the front marvellously (while not being boring) and is in fact an anti-war experience since one can easily realize how much bloodshed went in vain. Terribly support-heavy which can ruin your day. Not so elegant, but undoubtedly one of the great CDGs combined with combat factors.   
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
After 1 Play: Probably the most complex wargame I've played, but not overwhelming.  I've only played the introductory scenario, and while I did enjoy it, I have serious doubts as to whether I would enjoy the full game.  I doubt it will ever come up though, because I just don't see committing myself to the 10+ hour experience in order to find out.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Great! Given the fact that this is not a detailed history of the first world war. Some of the rules are a little harsh: especially permanent elimination due to overstack during retreat and failure to substitute an army with a corps during combat. This bears no resemblance to history and only creates some gamey tactics. It also takes a while to get accustomed to the flank rules which makes advances quite difficult to pull off. The special rules are not always easy to find, with some apparent but minor flaws. But beyond this petty criticism lies one terrific, gutwrenching game. Momentum is extremely important, and making the opponent take awkward decisions instead of attacking. It is one of the great classics!

Path of Glory o For the People. Dos leyendas vivas llenas de carisma y personalidad. La dificultad de acercarse a ellos es proporcional al gozo desorbitado que producen. Memorables en todos sus aspectos. Si has dado un paso firme en los CDG's con TS, no temas seguir tirando del hilo. 
_________________________________________________________

Este fin de semana yo y mi hermano mayor decidimos que ser√≠a el fin de semana de los juegos de guerra. Ya ten√≠a le√≠das las reglas de varios para tener entre los que escoger. Ten√≠a preparados algunos m√°s sencillos para empezar como el C&C:Ancients o el Combat CC: Pacific pero no pude evitar la tentaci√≥n de ojear las reglas de los que -pensaba -deber√≠a probar mucho despu√©s. 

El halo serio y mudo que rodea la negrura de la portada del Path of Glory me atrajo sin escapatoria. Qui√©n haya estado frente de la mirada del soldado an√≥nimo que aparece en la portada lo sabe. Sus ojos te est√°n diciendo: No mires hacia otro lado, te digo a ti.

Hubo otras lecturas esa misma semana como la del reglamento del Maria. Devor√© con frustraci√≥n el Revolution y casi estuve apunto de tirar la toalla al constatar el contenido de las VEINTE   fases que comprenden cada uno de sus turnos... Pero cabezota que es uno, a pesar de mi espesura mental al leer y releer acab√© sintiendo que podr√≠a lanzarme con √©l si fuera elegido.

Ya ten√≠a le√≠do de hac√≠a un par de meses el Wilderness y contando con la experiencia de haber jugado s√≥lo a un CDG - el TS -pens√© que ese deber√≠a ser el siguiente paso natural viendo los juegos que tengo.

Lleg√≥ el s√°bado y con √©l mi hermano. Vamos a ver la estanteria y miramos t√≠midos los que le indico que se pueden estrenar. Ese d√≠a s√≥lo eramos un par de soldados con coraz√≥n de eurogamer que quer√≠an meter sus botas nuevas, que les ven√≠an demasiado grandes, en el barro. 

Otra vez los ojos: No mires hacia otro lado, te digo a ti.

Mi hermano lo ve "Ese se puede ¬øno?" 
-S√≠ -le digo con un suspiro nervioso-. Lo dem√°s fue todo historia.


Literalmente, pero historia de la buena. De la que te entra por los ojos y te hace retumbar el pecho de la emoci√≥n. La tensi√≥n est√° en cada paso que das y ya no puedes desandar, estas escribiendo la historia y tus hombres est√°n en las trincheras mir√°ndote como el de la portada. Tira el dado. La sensaci√≥n de que todo pende de un hilo es deliciosamente asfixiante. Hay mucho que atender y todo son bajas...

No hace falta decir que para m√≠ ha marcado un antes y un despu√©s en cuanto a los juegos de mesa. Poco puedo aportar a lo que nuestro amigo Pavlo ya ha escrito en este memorable hilo y m√°s cuando apenas he puesto los pies en sus aguas, y sus posibilidades empiezan a abrirse para m√≠, pero no en forma de pinceladas o apartados recovecos sino m√°s bien como amplios horizontes de diversi√≥n.

El primer d√≠a apenas jugamos unos turnos por nuestras continuas consultas a las reglas pero su fuerte personalidad nos cautiv√≥ tanto que al d√≠a siguiente decidimos volverlo a empezar, realizando el doble de turnos que el d√≠a anterior en el mismo tiempo. Por favor, no teng√°is miedo de probar esta joya - ojo, digo, PROBAR no comprar; si gusta pues ya cada cu√°l es due√±o de su dinero -, aunque miedo seguir√° dando porque es todo un Grande. Y el sabor postrero es impagable.

Actualizaci√≥n:

Hay que santiguarse cuando se pronuncia el nombre de este juego y guardar silencio cuando se mire el rostro del soldado de su portada.

M√°s que un juego es historia. Tienes toda la primera guerra mundial en esta s√≥lida caja. El color negro de duelo que domina en ella responde a todas las miles de familias que vas a destrozar con cada una de tus decisiones. Avances o retrocedas, el precio siempre ser√° alto en terreno y vidas. 

Se siente el peso de cada una de tus decisiones. Llev√°is la pluma de la historia para relatar de una manera irrepetible cada paso de aquella terrible guerra. 

Si quer√©is un juego al que nunca dejar√©is de mirar con una mezcla de temor y respeto es √©ste. Jugadlo al menos una vez en vuestra vida.

Update:  Ultimately one of the most difficult games I've had to part with (especially on account of the shitty price I got for it on eBay).  But I just didn't see myself ever getting to try it and I was tired of it taunting me from the bookshelf.

01/27/08 - Well, I've now doodled around this this game a bit during a bout of spare time I had, and it turned out that playing the game revealed how non-iron-clad my understanding of the rules was.  In any event, the game looks good.  I think, to a large degree, the unfamiliarity of WWI's history has quite a bit of mystique to it, and the game play, fundamentally, is rather simple.  Looking forward to the clearly brutal supply rules.

06/18/07 - I have to be honest with you all here at BGG - Paths of Glory would hold no interest for me if it weren't everyone else's golden goose.   And I'm sure it's great, but G@ddammit it's not like I didn't already have enough games I was already interested in waiting for my time too.  Damn you and your prissy love for this game.

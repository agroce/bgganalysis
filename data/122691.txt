A strange and very, very interesting deckbuilder that casts players as alchemists all vying to be the first to craft the legendary Philosopher's Stone.  Clearly has its roots in Dominion, but is considerably more than just a re-skin.  And unlike Dominion, the theme is extremely well integrated into the game.  A key mechanism for adding more cards to your deck is to combine reagents and see what happens; for a game based on alchemy, that's about as perfect a marriage of mechanics and theme as I've seen in a while.

The problem is that I'm not convinced there's a lot of strategy to the game; about half of the cards that are truly worth having in your deck are essentially randomized, which significantly dilutes the pleasure of trying to figure out which cards are going to work well with each other.

Nevertheless, it definitely held my attention.  This rating is very likely to change after more play-throughs if I can figure out whether all the moving parts are real depth or just chaos.

Well worth a look for anybody curious to see a very different take on deckbuilders.  (Though be warned, my fiancee and I both found the rulebook bewildering.  Unless you can find somebody to teach the game, YouTube is mandatory for learning it.)

A cool deckbuilder with risk management and discovery.  It's a shame it totally flew under everyone's radar and is now OOP.

Very neat mechanisms in this one! This game feels like a non-app version of Alchemists to me, and that's a very good thing.

The best deckbuilding game so far. Superior to Dominion and very different with a specific goal (which you have to find out during the game) and the T8 to handle the many experiments with.

Interesting idea, but the rules were not the greatest. It took far more effort to learn than it should have. Now that I know it, I may play it again. But then, maybe not.

What I initially thought was harsh penalties for failure in fact is just a basic element of a deck builder.  Unlike my friend Paris I would actually like to play again.

The discovery aspect of this deck-builder is very intriguing on a first play, but suffers greatly on replay.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

In our first game all three of us enjoyed the game.  There are quite a few similarities to Dominion in how the deckbuilding aspect works, but the alchemy experiments and dice rolling as well as the matrix and research add in a very different and interesting piece.  Once you own two different types of reagents and are successful at transmuting them, you generally receive an additional card that is beneficial toward the end goal of making your magnus opus.  Also, you are able to acquire a research card that enhances your ability to transmute which is up the luck of the die roll of d8.  I'm looking foward to playing again and seeing how the discovery matrix takes shape next time!

Clever grid system. Set-up for this game takes a few minutes, but play is nice and smooth. Not a ton of replay, but you will play it 10 times or so and still occassionally crack it out.

RATING: 7.25
Neat deckbuilder, and the alchemy theme shines through. It avoids the typical "trash all your starting cards" pitfall that most deckbuilders fall into. You buy ingredients and transmute them using a die roll (modifiers are possible). Each pair of ingredients has its own unique yield (which varies from game to game).

It's not a VP game, it's a race game. And the luck doesn't bother me...until the endgame. Someone can luck into a win between the way the clues are discovered and the die roll for the final transmutation. Case in point: in our last game, my wife attempted the make the philosopher's stone (which ends/wins the game) and she needed a 3 or better on a d8; she rolled a 1. Two turns later, I made my own attempt. I needed a 6 or better. I rolled a 6. 

I do like this game a lot, but it's a better journey than destination.

Ryan has this at the moment.

When I try a game for the first time, I look at what is the best number of players according to BGG, which was at the moment I looked 4. However this is a deckbuilder and for deckbuilders my credo is always 'less is better'! So 2 is definitely my best number for this game.

The game itself: there is some luck involved as you roll a die, but in general I like the gaming mechanism.

Has deck building mechanics as a base but it adds a bit to it in the game play. I love the theme, I really feel like I'm experimenting and discovering something. Managing gold and making an efficient deck is key.

There's some clever things going on here.  I'd like to try it a couple more times.  The theme and box art maybe is holding it back?  It's a good game.

My favorite solitaire-style deckbuilder. If you like the theme, this is a great game. Captures the feel very well. Not a complicated game, there's a couple cards/rules (shelf comes to mind) that could use clarification, but overall easy enough that I play it with my family. After a game or two, plays briskly with run time about 20-25 minutes per player.

Set up is easier than Eldritch Horror, but more involved than Dominion.

A magnum opus this isn't
OK, with that out of the way, the game recycles a bunch of well known mechanisms that work just fine and gobbles them together in a game that works just fine. Its theme is kind of pasted on, but I don't really care about that too much. Once you get the 4 phase structure cleared up in your head (which actions are linked to what phase) it's pretty straight forward.
My problem with this game is that the luck factor is too big for the play time. I know the play time can vary quite a bit depending on how the cards come out, which is an other problem I have with this game. But back to the luck factor. You have to find the ingredients to the philosophers stone. Those ingredients are randomly drawn from three stacks. Once you have a card from a stack, you can not get a second one or replace it. My problem with this is that the 'cost' of those cards varies from 1 to 4. If you're lucky you'll draw three 1s and to win the game you'll have to roll a 3 on a d8. If you're not so lucky, you'll draw three 4s. And you'll have to roll a 12 on a d8. There are ways to compensate for that with experience tokens (of which you can have a maximum of 5) and discounts, but still, you can see that that can be quite a difference. The same goes for the other formulas in the game of course, but those are fixed and the same for everyone.
I found this game alright. I found it fine while playing, but it became a bit repetitive towards the end. Other players where quite frustrated with the way the game developed. But my biggest problem is the mismatch between length and luck.

Initial rating: 6.4

I like the way this game is exploratory every time since you don't know what's where and what the best ingredient combo is at the start.

This is an excellent example of why hopping on popular trends can be bad. The idea of the game - players gather ingredients, mix them, and get clues to achieving the winning goal - is fine. The core mechanism - deckbuilding - is fine. The combination of the two is terrible.

Why? After the initial phase of the game, in order to progress you will need to get specific combinations of ingredients in your hand (as opposed to just making whatever comes up and seeing what happens). But in a traditional deckbuilding game (which this is) that could take forever. The designer or developer seems to have realized that this is a problem so there are ways (such as the table) to ameliorate it. That's OK, but it really makes the deckbuilding aspect pointless: you get some stuff you need on your table and grind the deck until you get the rest. It's a boring slog.

I like the concept, and most of the game. But it basically came down to a roll of the die at the end.

So far my favorite DBG, probably because of the investigation aspect and the absolute victory condition. It takes forever to set up though.

RATING: 5.5
Some fun things going on here, but unfortunately, the whole game is pretty much a luck-fest.  Early game "free" resources are random.  Then, blind experimentation is random.  Once the big clues are found, if you don't have the right components to get them, you've got to race to catch up.  Oh, yeah, and everything is determined by a series of die rolls.

In our game, I was pretty much in last place the whole game - I couldn't find the clues.  But, then, all of a sudden, I randomly found a card that gave me a free clue, I got a couple of good die rolls, and then I rolled an 8 when I needed to at the end of the game.  I won on the tiebreaker.

RATING: 5
For me an ok deck builder. But I don't recommend playing this with 4. Too much downtime and chaos. Also I'm not a big fan of the discovery cards having negative effects. I do like the discovery matrix and search for the clue cards.

An interesting twist on the deck building formula, very good replay value.

Evo is a good family game with really amazing artwork and components. The choice of dinosaurs as a theme works very well. I really like the idea of taking a species, evolve it and adapt it to the climate change, especially when throughout the game you can see your species telling a story of what it has become. The gameplay instead is simple and doesn't provide you with a lot of choices to make, but it also makes the game flow very fast and smooth... and again simple doesn't mean stupid! You're betting your victory points, so you have to be very careful of how much you spend and about which gene you want to invest in. 

On a first impression I wasn't really happy with Evo, because I was expecting more fighting... not like a light war game, but still some more. After more plays I realized that the game is more about area control and adapting to survive the climate than fighting, which instead is not always necessary. At that point I even ended up liking the fact that it can be a "peaceful" game, if you want it to be.

So... what do I think about Evo at the end? It's a good and unique game, that maybe should get more appreciation, and it's a great game to play with your family.

Nice area control game that reminds me of Smallworld. Here each player starts with the same powers but each turn there is a bidding for new powers. Your species grow stronger turn after turn and they try to survive on the board. I liked the weather mechanic that every turn  changes the climate for each type of terain. There is a die for combat but usually the stronger animal wins. Components and artwork are nice. Easy to teach, fast to play.

Fun game with some flaws. Somehow the genebidding didn't feel that great though. At the early rounds all genes are good and I feel like it doesn't matter that much which one I want to have so I just try to get anything. On the other hand the value of genes drop and many times I just didn't feel like I was going to bid anything on anything. Maybe the other players overbid. Also, I would like it more if there more than 8 dinos / player.

Szaporodós, kiszorítós, egyedfejlődős dinós játék. Nem rossz! A licitre majdnem mondtam, hogy Amun-reből származik, de ez a játék (az 1. kiadása) előbb készült! Nagyon tetszenek a spéci lapkák, jó a menete is, egész jól is néz ki. A játékostáblák lehetnének sokkal kisebbek, de akkor nem lehetne ekkora dobozként eladni. Az időjárás korong tetszik, ennyi kiszámíthatatlanságot tolerálok:) Egész könnyű maga a szabály, akár családi játék is lehetne, ha nem kihalás lenne a fő téma:) Nem tudom megfogalmazni miért, de nem lesz kedvenc, de szívesen játszom vele bármikor.

It is as good as the first edition, but components and graphic design have changed enormously.  The first edition was quite cartoony, and this one is almos futuristic, which is quite odd for a prehistoric game...

Got this from Secret Santa 2013. This game was a major let down (not your fault, Santa!). I was expecting the game to be a bit less about the auction and a bit more about the "board play", but that wasn't the case, at least in our games. I'd pass on this overall.

Everything in this game is predictable and obvious except for the auction.  But that is a lot of extra work for a kind of limp auction.  Speaking of the auction, it caps at a price of 6 which is probably too low early game, but late game nothing is worth paying for at all.  But it has dinos and technological upgrades which always piques my interest.

Asmodee version (whose rules are a bit different, I think), excellent components. The game reminded me a lot of Small World, although I preferred the dinosaur theme, the game pace and length, and the auction. Next time, though, we will play with the cards faced up before bidding, lest they are bought for too cheap of a bid.

Yet another game that should not be listed as two-player. The auction mechanic just doesn't work with two. It was so stupid to be bidding every turn on just one gene tile, and the game basically ended as a draw. The winner was simply the person who had spent less on the auctions throughout the game. Blech.

Evo is actually a decent game which somehow reminds me a little of Small World. What I really like in this game is the mutation/adaptation genes, which means you can customize your dinosaurs and try to take out your opponents'!
I like the changes in the second edition just fine (combat etc.), and especially the "special genes" are a welcome addition.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is one mean area control and auction game. Each round you bid on 1 trait using your VPs with only 1 person can claim each trait and then move your dinosaurs around the map potentially attacking others and trying to survive extinction. Every round you get points for each dinosaur you have left and that's about it. Pretty simple rules but this game can get vicious quick especially with the full amount of players as there is simply not enough room for everyone. I'm surprised how well these 2 mechanics work together and would be willing to play this again.

Enjoyed my first play of this (new edition). The evolutionary customisation of your species is a good mechanic and pretty thematic. The board and changing safe climate zones make the game dynamic and induce combat which is also good.

A little concerned that some of the unique gene's may be a bit overpowered - although this should be mitigated to an extent by players who are familiar with the game ensuring the winner of such genes has had to bid high for them.

Like the old art but also like the new art.

The rule changes make this better than the first edition.

It's the Cyclades/Amun Ra auction mechanic stripped down to it essence to survive rounds on a board with a dial determining where disasters are striking. It's eruo mechanics wrapped around a simulation experience. It's not bad, but I think I would rather play Cyclades: Titans given the choice.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Confused about the strategy as it is obfuscated behind the "dinos on a map" thing when it's really an auction game. Bidding likely works better with 4\5 players: Bidding 6 and being unable to lose seemed so much better than bidding 5. The chance present in the combat is irksome. Players mostly only fight if they have horns up on the opponent, though they do end up fighting when no other move is possible.

RATING: 8
First off - BEAUTIFUL GAME! (The 2011 edition; not the earlier cartoony version.) I mean, they really went all out for artwork and components. Really impressed. I know there's a backstory to the dinosaurs here, along with some sort of symbiotic relationship with mystical human leaders blah blah blah... overlook it: it looks quite unnecessary. The mechanics here have all been done before but they're tied together very nicely in this game. Good bidding mechanic and area control. I like the building up of evolutionary traits. Quite a bit of randomness will never make Evo a strategic game purely, but it's part of the game's charm here. It does appear very difficult to catch up if you lose steam early on. And things get a bit chaotic during the endgame. Still, I'm looking forward to trying this again some time. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
An okay game about dinosaurs. Nothing to write home about for my group, although the gene-auction mechanic makes it more strategic than it appears to be at first glance. Now if only there were a game that's midway between Dominant Species and EVO, it'd be great.

Asmodee did away with the cute artwork from the original.  Even though I was a fan of it, I think the new artwork is an improvement.
The new rules help to lessen the randomness and streamlined the turn phases. 
The climate wheel is probably the biggest improvement.  At 1st glance it looks confusing; but it does a great job of showing the current and upcoming land areas condition.
Tokens and wooden bits are done well; but the player boards are too big for what they do and are on the thin side.  

Overall I think this new edition is a nice update/improvement to the original.

RATING: 8
(01/2012) After seeing it go OOP, and longing to play it again for 3+ years, I finally received the reprint. I am surprised (and disappointed) at the re-imaging, going from a humorous, light-hearted approach, to the darker, middle-earth, Chaos in the Old World theme. Gone is the whimsical Mr. Potatohead tableau, where you can visually see your dinosaur "evolve" into some horrific (and equally silly-looking) monstrosity, with multiple arms, legs, horns, and skin. Instead, each player's tableau depicts a unique, almost historically accurate depiction of some specie. The "genes" are tokens placed below the picture, signifying some mutative advantage. I have yet to play the re-imaging reprint, but I was so looking forward to creating and visualizing my own mutation. I hope the gameplay hasn't changed much, even though I understand there are a few rules tweaks.

Update (01/21/12): Our first 4-player game of the re-imaged game was brutal and fun. The others had never played and agreed that this is a good design. Unfortunately, one of the players got an egg during the first round for free, and as before, ran away with the game--we now know better than to let that happen again. While I miss the cartoonish artwork, all agreed that the new artwork is superb; the best thematic graphics of almost any game to date--the climate wheel looks like a jewel.

Looking at past reviews, there are a number of significant changes between the first and second editions: 1) initiative is based on bidding position for the mutation/adaptation genes, and tails have been done away; 2) climate change is based on a token draw instead of a die roll; 3) combat die is no longer a regular D6, but has symbols which serves approximately the same odds as before; 4) there is a 1-in-6 chance for a stalemate, otherwise depending on the difference in horns, the defender will have a dinosaur [i][b]removed[/b][/i] from the game, whereas previously it was returned to the owner to possibly be regenerated; 5) evolution occurs after climate change now, instead of later in the turn; 6) movement/combat happens after evolution, instead of before; 7) there are 12x climate tokens, delineating strictly 9 to 12 turns, with the a game-ending "meteor" event occurring in one of the last three climate tokens; 8) players only have 8x dinosaurs max, so elimination due to combat is more devastating, while the older game had 10x wooden disks; 9) there are 12x new "special" genes, 8x of which are mixed in with the regular genes, each having a unique power/ability, such as flying or amphibious movement, chameleon capability for defense, or ability to predict the future climate; 10) island size is based on number of players (it comes with islands for 3/4/5 players, just like in Small World), instead of adjusting the number of turns; 11) one event card is available each turn during bidding, with "number of players minus one" genes pulled out of the bag; winning the event card will give the player first initiative, only modified by number of dinosaurs on the board.

The gameplay shares a very similar feel with Dominant Species (and a little bit of Trias), but plays in 90 to 120 minutes. It keeps it very simple: climate change, auctioning for mutation/adaptation/events, turn re-ordering, movement/combat, breeding, and survival. Turns are deceptively fast, due to the very focused and limited choices every player has. Because of this, if feels like it has been tightened significantly. We're looking to play this again soon. Initial rating was a '7', and now bumping it up to an '8'

RATING: 9.1
This game is pretty awesome.  Might have too much conflict for some euro gamers but if you don't mind conflict, it's a blast being attacked by killer baby dinos.  It's weight is like vegas showdown but with more direct interaction on a central board and the game feels a bit more tense.  

The game is tense because you are trying to keep your dinos from dying (like Agricola and keeping your family from starving).  Maybe it's more like small world with an auction phase for selecting powers.

One other thing to note is that when you have all 8 of your dinos out on the map there are way too many movement options and you just need to make a decision or your brain will explode especially if you have the sixth sense special dino ability. 

Love the new artwork!  I didn't buy the first edition because of the cartoony look.

I loved the theme and also its accessibility. This was one of the first games I got and kept it for a while in my collection. What got it culled in the end was that my tastes have evolved and I now tend to like deeper and more complex games, which Evo is not.

Very great game tons of depth but still able to be taught to a gateway gamer. Has tough choices and great powers for each creature to purchase. Also has a fantastic bidding mechanic. I do love bidding. I will play this game whenever given the oppertunity.

Interesante juego donde se subastan mejoras que te ayudan a sobrevivir a las variaciones climáticas y mueves a tus dinosaurios por el tablero, buscando posicionarte bien y reproducirte. Me gusta sobre todo el sistema de pujas, en el que empleas tus propios puntos de victoria. Vendido porque el tema subasta ya me aburre un poco, pero es un buen juego.

RATING: 7
A good game about guiding your own clan of dinosaurs to survive through various changes in the climate. It has area control, bidding, combat, and "character" building, in that you can choose the various ways in which your dino clan "evolves" to better survive. 

I REALLY like the bidding system in the game. There are a bunch of different "evolutions" that all give the dinos special traits and abilities, and in order to obtain them, you have to outbid the other players. However, this presents a bit of a quandary, because the "money" you are bidding with also counts as your victory points. I love this system. Do I pick up that evolution that I really want that two other players are also competing for and thus has the potential to require spending a hefty chunk of victory points to get it? Or do I snipe the evolution that isn't getting as much attention on the cheap to see what becomes available next? It's great fun trying to adapt around those decisions. 

The area control aspect of the game is also decent, and the combat effective, but it's the bidding and the evolutions (appropriately) that really make this game. One downside is that playing with two players is not nearly as satisfying as playing with more. I would actually say 3 should be the minimum, and 4 or 5 is definitely best. However, it is still pretty fun regardless of player count.

We are really enjoying Evo and find some similarities to Kemet, given that it is essentially an area control game with special player powers.  Evo, however, is much more interesting and requires more strategy than Kemet.  Specifically, Evo has an streamlined auction and a unique tech tree mechanism, but is still easy to explain and understand.  Beautiful components.

Initial Rating: 7.5 (February 2012)

I have played twice with this edition now. I don´t like the changes with the weather. In this edition (as in the former) you can predict the next weather with a high degree of accuracy, however in this edition there are only 2 weather tokens with a different weather pattern whereas in the former edition there was a chance EACH turn that the weather will change to an unexpected setting. I don´t like games with much luck, but in this case I prefer the former weather system. :D

Also there is a little change in the theme of the game, in this edition you embody a tribe who has a relationship with the Dinos, on this point I also prefer the former edition.

And with the special genes I´m not sure yet, I want to play the former edition again to form a better opinion if they are and improvement or not, but so far I don’t like that you can have some unique permanent advantage over the other players.

The art in this edition is pretty cool but for me right now this edition is inferior to the original one. 

This is a good light game.

Current Rating: 7.5

Perhaps I’m being irrational, but I really prefer the first edition of the game over this one. The art, components and overall game is better in the first one (according to me), perhaps the only improvement from my point of view, are the VP chips, now you can hidden your VP total. Also (I could be wrong) but this edition has no initiative gen, I really liked that. 

For those reasons, I will try to stay away from this game, and I’m downgrading its rating. If I want to play, I will use the first edition.

Current Rating: 5.0

Update late 2011: I picked up the Asmodee re-release and played it 5p yesterday. Production is very attractive - I think the art suits the game better than the original cartooney look. The additional unique special abilities add some variety and make for some fun combos - killer flying babies rock! Seemed to take longer this time around, although I suspect that was people pondering their moves longer - maybe the less cartoonish art makes people take it more seriously?!
---------
Nice mixture of light wargame (those spaces are really hexes, hex and counter lovers) and tech-tree expansion. There are four types of terrain on the board, and the survivability (if that's a word) of the players' dinos in each fluctuates with the climate. This means players cannot settle for long as (after the opening rounds) there is usually competition for the currently most favorable terrain.

Players must also manage how their dino evolves, with an auction each turn of tech builds that can improve your dino's fighting strength, survivability, reproductive abilities etc. While I'm not exactly short of games with an auction in them somewhere, in this one you bid VPs which makes it trickier than most; if you really want a particular build you can probably have it, but is it really worth 10 VPs, given a winning score in the thirties or forties (for a 5 player game? 

Only played once, and was glad we left out the cards at the recommendation of the player who ran it to leave just the core game.

Nice game all in all, although there's no way I'd pay the 100 Euros/100 dollars prices people are currently asking for second hand copies.

It`s a good game for what it is. Graphic is great and it`s quite fun to play. It only makes sense to play it with at least 4 players.  You bid for type best genes in the laboratory and need to adapt your dinosaurs to the changing climate conditions. Not to deep but quite alright.

I'll keep Small World for now, but I'll probably try to convince anyone who's tried Small World and liked it to try this game.

One negative comment though, the rules aren't the clearest, with an example that obviously was written for a version that had different colors and some terminology never really clarified.  Feels like a rushed translation.  Figured out some rules by checking out forums.

Area control, roll dice for fights, a simple little tech tree to improve your odds, a few take that -cards. Too simplistic for my tastes for what it seems to try to be, maybe.

The auction system is nice and pretty much where the game happens. In the area grabbing phase you usually have very obvious optimal moves depending on the movement order. Too often trying to get the others to bid a bit more for techs and just grabbing the card is the best option. Especially if you tied in your population, in which case the card buyer gets to go first.

Why play this when there's Small World?

Small world style game, but with Dinosaur evolution theme.

In Evo, you play a nomadic people in symbiosis with a primitive reptilian species. You travel the wild open spaces of Kumgath with your mounts, you will use your knowledge of biology to help them adapt and succeed against both the hostile and changing climate and other competing species.

I prefer the original but perhaps that is because it is what I am more familiar playing. My play of this one was quite lopsided due to two of us being unable to stop the third player. Didn't help only one horn came out for most of the game and he was the one that also purchased it.

I am glad I was able to get my hands on this and give it a go. That being said I am still a little on the fence with Evo, as my final rating could possibly fall depending on how future games play out. In my first game I played a two player game, and highly discourage anyone from playing this game as a 2 player affair. The game lives and breathes off of the genes, and with only one gene coming into play each round it becomes boring and not very interesting. The bidding mechanic in a two player game also suffers as the player who bids first can always easily be outbid and forced to take the other option due to the rules of the game.  After that play we set back up and played a 2 dinosaur per side game, and this was much more interesting.
The mechanics in the game aren't all that unique, but they have a very interesting theme to them that makes quite a bit of sense and so you end up with a very thematic gaming experience. The bidding mechanic for genes is a pretty interesting, and the movmeent brings many tough choices to the players. The always changing climate could have been a bit more dynamic in action, but thematically its understandable as to how changed. The battle mechanic is streamlined and makes for some interesting tactical choices. 
Overall Evo is a worthwile endevour that presents a fun game that you can play in under an hour. Decent amounts of player interaction, and randomness will contribute to a different game every time.

RATING: 7
Despite initially viewing this game as having too simple of choices, the simplicity hides a decent amount of depth. It's still probably a light-weight Euro-hybrid, but besides the resource management of genes becoming progressively less useful as the game progresses, there are some nice combos (eggs + thick shell + killer babies is terrifying) and a bunch of small tweaks in strategy that makes you play more optimally (diversifying which areas you can survive on so the number of dinosaurs you have to move each turn is kept at a minimum, etc.).
 
This game I feel plays best with 4-5 players, as the auction falls flat with 2, and the 3 player board has too much maneuvering room. This game's auction mechanics work very well, and while the attack die can suck, there is meaningful interaction in the attacks/blocking people without people having no chance of coming back (since you can save at least 2 dinosaurs/round). While this game has a lot of phases, I still had great success teaching this to nongamers, as the art/theme is a huge plus, and the phases feel very fluid after the first couple of rounds.

EDIT: I've had games of this take as short as 40 minutes and as long as 2 hours. I think the reason for this time variance is there are several phases where you take incremental steps one at a time instead of doing your entire turn for the phase at once, and what your opponent does may cause you to have to reevaluate your plan (usually a minor adjustment, but for AP prone people the though process that should take 5 seconds can drag on for minutes). When it is under an hour, this is a great game of evolving your dinosaurs and pretty strategic for its length. When this game goes on for 90+ minutes, it is a too-light-for=its-length morass that I wish could just end.

Played a two player game by adding in an extra mutation token each round.  Really liked the chance for each player to gain a mutation each round.  Probably wouldn't have like it as much forcing one player to take a card.  It was a really good game that is similar to Small World without as much attacking.  The AP wasn't as bad as I thought it might be.  Can't wait to try it with more players.  The safe terrain will definitely be more precious and I can see more attacking taking place.

A spectacular graphics overhaul for a classic that I somehow never got around to try in its first edition. A great mixture of reacting to the situation at hand and, especially during the latter half of the game, developing some kind of strategy along with your dinosaurs. This could easily gain a rating of 8 or even higher, but the quite atrocious german rulebook made our game a lot slower than it needed to be, and I’m still unclear on whether there is some timing structure for the playing of event cards. Or whether this really matters. If you’re willing, however, to muddle through the rulebook (or, better yet, can get along with the french original), then this is a great game when you want to scratch the light wargame itch, but only have around an hour to play.

I only have and have played the new (2nd edition) so I can’t comment on comparing it to the first. I like the look and feel of the game and the theme. But I cannot seem to get past the randomness of the climate change. If you don’t have some hot or cold protection from turn 1, you will die early and often. Yes, there’s an auction to get those genes, but that assumes those genes come up for auction. I’ve only played a few times, so maybe it was bad luck, but just didn’t happen. Some of the cards can help balance that, but again way too much randomness here. Need to play more, but not really happy with this purchase (but at least I got it on a super sale). 

Edit: After many more plays I have discovered new good and bad. The good is that I find myself enjoying the theme more – it’s genetically modified fighting dinosaurs after all! And because of that, I worry about the random climate problem less since it affects everyone as well. And that if lucky you can get the flinging exploding babies combo is just hysterical. 

On the other side I find some of the “special traits” not so good/fun and that though there is conflict, it actually happens less than you’d think. The movement point cost to fight is what hampers things especially if legs don’t come out of the bag early. 

Overall I find the cards vary varied, and that’s not a good thing. I’d almost rather play with a house rule of “draw 2, keep 1” to mitigate it. And maybe a house rule for the climate wheel where players could auction the ability to move the wheel – that might be fun there.

It has been so long since I played the first edition of this game... I miss the umbrella's lol..

The climate change wheel horrified me at first but by the end of the game it was ok.

We played a five player game and the board was a bit too static.  It was very difficult to break into a new zone it seemed.  

The winning player managed to get three eggs and I recall they were VERY powerful in the prev edition as well.

I like this enough to put it on my buy list.

07/09/13 Played a four-player game in 2.3 hours. 
I had rated the first edition a "6" when I played in once in 2004.  I'd say most of the changes made for this edition were for the good. Though I rolled my eyes at the "theme creep". The first edition was more scientific/historical. This second edition added some cock-and-bull story about humans helping their herds of dinos survive. Certain items were added (like the scrolls that reduced costs) that made little sense from a reality perspective. But at least they worked game-wise. The artwork was different. Some changes were for the good (getting rid of the somewhat whimsical nature of the first edition, like little umbrellas as adaptations to ward of heat/UV rays) but adding a fantasy looking element to the second edition that threw science out the door (adding fairy-like humans to the player boards and cards). Overall the nine game play changes seemed to be for the good. So I rated this version a "7". Hopefully it won't be another 9.5 years before I play Evo again!

This is such clean and clever area control with a few bells and whistles to add some depth and variety in the form of the ability to evolve your dinosaur.  Simple, short, and very fun.

You have to like a game with a dinosaure theme. I enjoy bidding games and Evo has you bidding on the geane modifications of your herd of Dinosaures, which speaks to me.

RATING: 9
For a simple game, this game really has a lot of deep strategy. The bidding of Victory points for mutations really make people think about what a mutation is worth, and placement on the board to deny possibilities of other players birthing new dinosaurs is crucial to the game, and since you don't know precisely how many turns you are playing you really can't wait too long to start scoring your points. The only slight flaw of the game is that a few of the action cards are less useful than others, but since there is nothing gamebreaking or utterly useless in the deck, that is a very small flaw.

Absolutely loved this game on the first play but I found it doesn't replay well. The quality of the production is quite nice for the various tokens, the climate change wheel, the dino meeples, the two gameboards for 2/3 and 4/5 players -- but then you have the player boards which are similar to the Castles of Burgundy mats -- a tick or two above paper quality.
-----
After a recent play, I'm not sure [i]replayability[/i] is the issue I take with Evo. I like that it's an auction game disguised as a combat game, but maybe a bit too much luck involved? Also AP is exacerbated. Under the right circumstances (5 players, maximum game time of 75 minutes), I can see myself rating this higher, maybe a 6. Still not enough to want to reacquire or even suggest it.

First impression (5 players): I liked some changes : special genes add some extra variety, losing tails as it was a bit meh-gene and much, much improved board for showing what areas are hot/cool/deadly (I personally had problems with this in original for some reason). 

Not sure if I like tokens instead of dice roll to determine climate. Makes it more predictable but not sure if it fits the game as being able to "know" that some things just can't happen anymore is not fun in this type of game. I don't like too much of the fact that attacker cannot lose a dino. Unsure if I like more or less the fact that every species starts with 2 legs but no cold/hot resist at start. 

Graphics are superb in new edition even though player mats are a bit too big perhaps.

A more polished production that the first edition, but it's lost a bit of the charm. There are a few rules changes, but it retains all the elements that made the first edition so enjoyable - direct conflict, asymmetrical sides, hard fought auctions - only this time aggression is less of a risk. A lot of fun.

Mi è sembrato un gioco con poca interazione (giusto un abbozzo nell'asta e poco, molto poco nei combattimenti) e troppo lungo. La durata è poco più di un'ora, me se fosse durato meno sarebbe stato bello (?) uguale. Le evoluzioni delle razze, i combattimenti, e la continua ricerca dell'habitat ideale sono un tantino freddi. Gioco secondo me poco coinvolgente.

Never thought I would be able to purchase a new version of this one after the old one went out of print years before I even got into euros.  The remake is mostly the same, and the changes I believe are all subtle improvements.  I miss the artwork of the original, but I still enjoy the new artwork.  I love dinosaurs, and this is one of my favorite games.

RATING: 4
"Cute but cutthroat area control with a dinosaur/mutations theme, built around cool auctions."

What I like:
- I enjoy multi-auctions like this
- Colorful, with over-produced components

What I don't like:
- Ran way too long (2.75 hours after rules/setup, with 1 round removed)
- I don't like games with this much conflict
- Card effects were less useful than I had hoped

Before playing it, I didn't really get the comparisons to Smallworld, but now I can see them. The on-map play is similar, although it takes longer for the board to get crowded. The jostling is more simultaneous in Evo rather than you having your whole turn uninterrupted as in SW.

I really like this auction format (very similar to Vegas Showdown and Homesteaders). I don't like the heavy conflict on the map. I would put the weight around 2.6, slightly higher than BGG voters.

Our 5p game with 4 first-timers took 2.75 hours after rules/setup, and that was after removing an extra climate disk from the stack. The meteor didn't hit until the very last round.

Some improvements over the first edition. Climate is a bit more predictable. Everything is a lot less cartoony. Still pretty much the same game. Seems a shame that they didn't make slightly different dino's as an option (e.g. on the backside of the normal ones).

RATING: 7
Looks great and it's a decent game, but feels just a little flat, with most turns coming down to small population adjustments and not many big, dramatic plays. Some of the special genes also feel a little unbalanced - e.g. killer babies seems to be a no-brainer early on, even at full cost.

I'll gladly play this occasionally, but in general I prefer Small World for the board play and Cyclades for its very similar bidding mechanism.

RATING: 5
It's a dinosaur combat game. The main idea is that the board has a few different types of terrain, only one of which you can completely survive on each turn. Each player in turn order moves their guys, and then you breed new guys. guys on the deadly terrain die, and then you score points for guys remaining.

To spice it up, there are upgrades you bid on at the star of each round that help increase your abilities.

Additionally, the game encourages combat, as moving into a space with another player's dinosaur stars a fight where if the attacker wins, he kills the other guy and takes the spot, and if the defender wins nothing happens.

It plays similar to Kemet, but has a few issues for me.
During the bidding phase, you either win an upgrade tile or you win an action card. The action cards are of varying usefulness, and so they act as a sort of consolation prize for not getting a tile that helps you in the long run. One type of tile is a "Vial" which has no ability other than to make all future purchases 1 cheaper. This can sometimes make the bidding feel like there are two consolation prizes in a round.

There is also a single unique tile that may or may not make it into the mix of tiles each game called "killer babies" where, if you win it, babies can spawn on other players causing a combat with a 50% chance of success, rather than the normal rules which is that they go in empty spaces. We found this single tile to be really game defining for the player who wins it.

We also felt that the game makes it somewhat difficult to punish the player in the lead, since points are secret and the changing terrain can cause players to splinter off on their own.

Additionally, having the attacks be no risk to the attacker feels uncomfortable.

One of those games where excitement over the theme bit me in the ass. It's not a bad game but a bit lackluster for two-players with the auction mechanic. My bad for not paying more attention at the time to important criteria such as how well a game scales, etc. Outside of the auction, we did have fun playing and having your dinosaurs survive as the conditions change becomes really tough after a while. It'll be a fun game to play as a family one day, and I'm positive my opinion will change. For now, I don't see it hitting the table except every once in a blue moon.

Looks to be a pretty good family game, It's easy to teach and fun to play. I like how the climate changing in the different terrain forces your dinos to move or adapt. The climate wheel is a fun way of showing the change. Using bidding on the available adaptations or event card as the turn order along with victory points as currency in the auctions are a great ideas. 

I liked the dinotopia based artwork of the second edition - it looks pretty awesome.

An interesting theme, an interesting concept, it's just crippled by the extreme unbalance it can come up with. Some of the upgrades to your dinos are superbly awesome, and some barely make a difference.

RATING: 9
Though not a particularly deep game, Evo manages to engage me every time I play. It's accessibly to all levels and ages of players.  The key to replayability of this game is the randomly inserted super mutations. These change every game and some powerful, though not game breaking, combos can emerge.  For example, hard shells plus killer babies equals long range death.  It's not necessarily an accurate evolution simulation (not since the mutations are supposedly engineered by a race of super humans), however, it's a beautiful game.  The graphic design is superb and the components are top-notch.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I will have to play this more before I can know how much I like it. It has great componants, a bidding mechanism that is pretty interesting (but chaotic since what upgrades are available is totally random each time), and a tech tree that is pretty cool. 

This is like Small World without the sucking. Small World was very uninteresting but this was much more interesting right off the bat.

RATING: 8
Very unique combination of area control, bidding and tactical decisions. One of the best light/medium weight games. Sure there is some luck in this game and you can't control everything but there are many small things you should pay attention to in order to win the game.  

Final edit. Sold away. Nice game but merely "ok" with three players. 5-player game is a bit too long and downtime is somewhat of a problem if you have new players in a 5-player game. The optimal number of players is four, and it is slightly too restrictive for such light and quite quick playing game. In any case, it rarely hit the table anymore and I didn't have much interest to play it anymore.

Elsőnek azt hallottam róla, hogy Dominant Species light, azért ez nem igazán állja meg a helyét, de vannak hasonlóságok. Alapvetően egy rettentően egyszerű játékról van szó. Mindenki egy dino kihalását próbálja megakadályozni, a korokon átívelő játékban. Mindegyik kor egy túlélő területfajtát határoz meg és 3-4 olyat, ahol jegesedés, forróság vagy éhhalál vár az ott levőkre. A játékosok célja vándoroltatni a dinóikat, hogy túléljék az adott korszakot. A játék 10-12 körös és minden kör végén annyi győzelmi pont jár, amennyi dino fent van a térképen. A dinok fejlődnek, érdekes módon ezt a megszerzett győzelmi pontok pénzként való felhasználásával licit során tudjuk változtatni. Mindig játékosszám -1 fejlődési lapkáért megy a licit Amun-Re módra, egy játékosnak pedig egy olyan kártya jut, amelyet a játék során egyszer tud majd felhasználni. A játékban van konfrontáció is, egymás dinoit lehet megenni, amelyek teljesen kikerülnek a játékból így sajnos meg van az esélye, hogy valakire rászállva teljesen kiessen a játékból. Hibája még az is a játéknak, hogy elképzelhető olyan eset, amikor licitálni és lépni sincs értelme egy-egy játékosnak, mert minden megfelelő már és ez nekem pl. úgy jött elő, hogy a legkevesebb lehetséges kört játszottuk. Ettől függetlenül egy abszolút jó játékot ismerhettem meg az EVO-ban. Gyönyörű a második kiadás.

A decently good game with some things that don't work too well for me.
Great thematic idea, we play in phases of placing dinosaurs (they have pink dinosaurs, how great is that?!), climate change, bidding for genetic improvement, movement, maybe fighting and populating. Then dinos might die and then we collect the points.
The phases and all mechanics can be a bit overwhelming at first, a bit into the game it is clear that it is not that complicated. The auction works fairly well even though it doesn't make much sense thematically and I usually don't care much for bidding in games, here it is fun I think. There are some cool extra genetic cards and the design overall is great.
I was displeased with the handling of the order of turns, something is really screwy there and it influences the game, plus it is a rather slow game with all those phases to go through.
I think it is good but not great.

Il loro primo avversario è il clima dai repentini cambiamenti che gli impone continui spostamenti. Ma non è il loro unico avversario… Per sopravvivere e prosperare, devono iniziare ad evolversi..."

EVO e' un gioco da tavolo dove ogni Giocatore controlla l'evoluzione di una particolare specie di... Dinosauri !!! Ed il gioco termina quando... Una meteora si schianta sulla terra !!!

Nel corso della partita, i giocatori cercano di acquisire i geni di mutazione per la propria specie che consentiranno agli esemplari di sopravvivere nelle varie condizioni climatiche, poiché in ogni turno il punteggio che si ottiene è pari ai dinosauri che sopravvivono. Al termine del gioco chi ha il maggior punteggio è il vincitore.

I am very pleased to own this game.  I bought it because of the designers tie to Small World, which is another game I enjoy.  The dinosaurs on the map struggling to survive will remind you a little bit of Small World, and since this game was designed first perhaps it was a partial inspiration for Small World.  The bidding process is very nice, although I still want to see if I can play that aspect better now that I know more about what things can do and know the importance of some genes over others.

I played this as a 2-player. I don't really recommend it.  You lose a lot in the bidding area and since you still include the same number of genes in the bag it was frustrating.

Haven't played this game yet but the art work is just downright gorgeous!
102812: Good game with standard Euro mechanics. I like that each player number has a different board. It is important to create enough tension in area control games.  Scoring was tight and competitive even though some players were in a real disadvantage early in the game. The first game indicated that the value of certain genes coming out early is important in winning the game. Late in the game, genes were less useful. This led to intense auction battles early on with players directly jumping the gun and bidding the maximum amount. Later on, the auctions were anticlimactic as we were almost bidding to get the lowest bid. This imbalance may be artificial since we weren't sure about bidding values in this game. As such, The end game scores for a four player game was incredibly low. Battles were aggressive since aggressors were rewarded and not penalized.  Good game overall with amazing production values and artwork. Really outstanding illustrations which helped set the tone for the game. 
111012: not as good with two. The auction falls flat and not much gene variation

Have played 2 player exclusively. Provisional rating of 8 after 4 plays. You don't get to see many gene tiles and the game is pretty quick at around the 40 minute mark. Sadly I assume it's a mere shadow of its multiplayer self.

The fun twists here: the "currency" you use to bid is the points you use to win the game (so, bid too vigorously and you'll lose). Also, you can customize your clan throughout the game to earn powers and qualities the others won't have.

The game is similar to Vegas Showdown, Cyclades, and several others.

With only two players this game is still rather fun, but I do think it's better with at least three.  It's easy to teach and fun to play.  I enjoy having to maneuver the adverse climate effects and terrain, and I think the bidding of victory points as currency in the auctions is a great idea.

Хе хей! Динозаврики вернулись. Начались битвы за выживание. Более строгое оформление, дино в начале менее приспособлены выносить суровые условия жизни на земле, карточки развития есть не у всех, зато разыгрываются каждый ход... И да - сейчас можно играть вдвоем. А вот к кругу, на котором отображается текущий климат, надо будет привыкнуть.

I really like this card mechanism and it makes an otherwise fairly standard and bland game into something worth playing. Whether it is sufficient to make the game a keeper in the long term is maybe doubtful because despite the fact that there are dozens and dozens of buildings available (which should create some variety) there are better resource conversion games out there (not least all of Rosenberg’s other games). The one thing that may just redeem it is the length of time it takes to play. If you can avoid any analysis paralysis (and there is plenty of scope for it). The game could even get by as a filler – there are only 4 rounds in total and they can play really quickly – particularly with only 2.

I have played 4 solo games so far and love it.  I can only see the multiplayer playing even better.  I will update my rating once played with more than 1. So far a great game!

Multiplayer is fantastic. Game play is smooth and is quick, but has depth and makes you think.  Lots of player interaction and competition for buildings.

Two things stand out about Glass Road. It's fundamentally a parsing problem, and chaotic resource management. First, what I really like about Glass Road is there is an element of psychology in terms of understanding what the other player(s) are after. The second thing I like about it is that the resources automatically convert, which really plays in when cards come out of your hand out of order courtesy of someone else playing a role. It feels interactive (because there are ways to gift resources to others), without being a direct conflict, and this plays in better at 3 and 4 (Supplier in particular becomes a weapon at 4p). In terms of focus. At 2p, it's a nice duel with extra control, while at 4p, you trade control of the central building board for more building churn (and thus, more options for building a chain). 

One thing that seems to bother us a bit (and really would if the game ran much longer) is you rarely see more than 1/3rd of the overall building pool in any given game, and combined with the fact that you'll see buildings whip past on other people's turns requires constant vigilance to the parsing problem. It runs a significant risk of being tactical or luck based without significant plays to get a handle on when risks can be taken or avoided (given the churn of buildings and knowing how fluid your chain can be). Understanding the cadence of card value across the game (especially Feudal Lord, Builder, and Supplier) is clutch.

There are some chokepoints (one good, one bad); first, you're going to have to pick all your cards each round which takes planning on the magnitude rarely seen (think; Lewis & Clark where you setup camp and then immediately start ordering your next 4 or 5 turns in general). Its a similar calculation to Millennium Blades in that you have 15-20 options and you're cutting them in half or so. The second one is related to the parsing problem that surrounds building/feudal lord; at what point does this just become unmanageable to say "i'm going to accumulate end game scoring points in ways X/Y/Z" vs something else? Playing with people who have AP is crushing due to these two choke points, especially since the game is played in lock step...

Some of my best games have been at 4p, and realistically, it's what I think I shoot for. Possibly my third favorite Uwe game behind O&L and Bohnanza.

RATING: 9
First play, solitaire, scored 23. Didn't really come up with a clear strategy, burned all my forests a bit too quickly.
Got 30.5 on third try woohoo!

Was floored by the level of choice and planning required. Sweet, sweet brain burn. But really pretty and a pleasure to play, and playtime is short even with moments of AP. I guess the extremely limited rounds won't be to everyone's taste, but it fills a much-neglected niche for me (heavy but short). 

Update: Tried with 3p and it's awesome. Selecting the last round actions and order was beyond agonizing. And very little downtime as everyone is choosing at the same time. AND the whole game including rules explanation was about an hour.

RATING: 7
A quick, light typically Rosenberg themed game of acquiring resources and building, with some unique mechanisms, and some wacky double-guessing gameplay.

The game plays from 2-4 players, and is played quickly over 4 short rounds.  Each round, you select 5 cards from a choice of 15 cards (each player has the same set of 15 different character cards which provide abilities), and choose 1 to play- this is where the craziness can occur: when another player has the card that you chose to play in their hand, they get to "tag along" getting half of the action and you only get half of the action, good for them, bad for you, so there is a significant component of guessing what your opponent will do.  The cards are predominantly used to acquire resources and build buildings.  The resource collection is unique and elegant and somewhat thematic, involving two separate wheels/dials, one for producing glass and one for producing brick- when you acquire resources they can become consumed in the production of the high end goods (glass, brick) and so managing these resources can be subtle and tricky- you really need to play a game to understand.  

Buildings are the means of getting points (and this is a LOW scoring game) and they come in three flavours: 1) production buildings- allow you to convert resources into different types, 2) one time buildings- provide an immediate effect/boost, 3) end of game scoring buildings.  There is a very large number of these buildings, which keeps the game fresh/variable.  It should be noted that each player has their own personal (identical) player board that has some space for buildings, but which also has land types (forest, brush, claypits, lakes) than need to be cleared/managed, somewhat similar to Ora et Labora.

Definitely a very light game, but since it plays so quick, the randomness that can occur is easily tolerated.  Appears to play quite well at all numbers.

This is similar to Ora et Labora, but with tiles instead of cards. It also boasts a faster and more streamlined experience than Ora et Labora. 

With that said, I enjoy BOTH -- one being more detailed than the other, and both with some interesting decisions throughout.

The solitaire rules are enjoyable as well, though I find that there's not enough granulation in the scoring (most scores tend to cluster about the same values for me). Still, it's enjoyment for any number.

Finally a refined minimum of the Uwe designs and I feel it is his best work as a result. The sly idea of playing a card which can be hobbled and matched by opponents is combined with a vast number of bonus tiles and a frustratingly smart method of tracking resources. A perfect blend! Love it.

Very refreshing game from Mr. Rosenberg. After Agricola and Le Havre his games have been big disappointments to me. They all failed in delivering the kind of elation you get from games with original ideas.

At first, Glass Road is daunting since the role selection and the resource mechanics are very untypical to a game of resource management. You really need to play quite a few times before final judging. After the first game I have a similar feeling as with Le Havre after the first game. You're at loss whether you liked the game very much or found it annoying because you had very little idea what you should really do. I really hope this proves to be on par with the two aforementioned masterpieces.

Update 2014-11
Rating from 6 -> 7
The more you play the better the game feels. I really like the action selection mechanic giving you hard time in analysing your opponents. What are the actions they would be trying to leech from you, and vice versa? You have to appreciate how dense and tense Glass Road is. Every choice you make is a difficult one. And all this is achieved without an overwhelming the amount of information.

RATING: 6.5
Solid offering by Rosenberg, but doesn't come close to Agricola or Caverna.  Yes, it's shorter, but it has a lot of potential for AP.  It has some tension with the card selection and competition for buildings.  It has a higher degree of randomness than Agricola or Caverna with the random building draws, which may or may not be a bad thing.  The resource dials are clever, but don't really add much to the game.  They don't seem much more efficient gameplay-wise than simply collecting cubes or animeeples.

All in all, I enjoyed my first two plays of it, but I feel it doesn't really live up to the hype.  It's a good game, but not a great one.

Wow!

I'd say this offers almost as interesting of a decision-making space as some of the 'larger' Rosenberg games but at substantially less of a time investment.  

I really like the card mechanic.  In short, players select five cards from a pool of 15 and then get to play three--if a card is played that is unique (other players didn't choose it), the player playing it gets to take both actions on the card; if a card is played that is non-unique, all players that have that card get to take one of the two actions on the card.  There's some other caveats around how that mechanic works, but it provides for a really interesting planning phase at the beginning of each round, where you are trying to choose some cards that are unique (you don't expect other players to play them, so hope to achieve the double action available on the card) and some cards that are non-unique (you hope other players will choose them so you can get a 'bonus' single action off the card plus deny your opponent the double action).  

With only four rounds to play and effective card choice having the possibility to swing your number of actions anywhere from 3 (you play three cards, all of which the other players also chose, and they played no card matching your other two) to 8 (you play three cards, none of which the other players chose, granting you two actions per each of those three cards; plus you happen to hold two cards that were each selected by at least one other player, granting you one bonus action per each of those two cards), you really have to try to understand not only your own strategy, but also your opponents' strategies so you can more effectively guess what they will and will not select.

Clever clever clever!  The rules book was dense for a game that played pretty smoothly.  [b]Witch's Brew[/b]-style card and bluffing play...a great resource mechanic...and typical Rosenberg-ian building add up to a fun game with lots of possibilities.  The rules made it seem fiddly, but it played quite easily, with almost no need to look up rules.  Fairly short too...doesn't seem tedious.  Nicely done!

An interesting game.  Plays with Mr. Rosenberg's produce/consume engine in a different manner.  The wheels drive all, yet they merely reflect all the stuff happening via cards played and the individual player boards.

I want to like this one more but I don't.  Going early in the turn order is worse.  Having players match your lead is actually painful unless you reciprocate.  In our 3-player game, we had rounds where one person had 7 actions, another (me) had 6 actions, and the third had 4 actions.  Guess who won?  The guy who got to take more actions.  Guess who came in second?  Me, with the second-most actions.  This disparity can be painful if not crippling and it's endemic to the game.

I have heard that this plays better with 2 players.  I wouldn't mind trying it out and seeing if that's preferable to 3 or 4 players.

1st play - I was a little lost on what to do or how to approach this game.  So I picked a building and started on my way.  My wife decided she understood what to do right away and drafted off my actions like crazy. I think I only took her actions twice, she hit me 1-2 times EVERY round, and she won 20 to my 15.5.  The suspense of revealing your action unsure whether you'll be able to double up or not is great and the playtime is short.

2nd play - I approached this time with a plan, ready to be more efficient with my moves. I found building synergy and got a decent engine going. Unfortunately my wife did the same and beat me 23-22.  Honestly I went into this game thinking I could play my own board without looking at hers. She looked at mine and drafted off of me like crazy. In one round I went first, she drafted me twice and emptied her hand before me. 

This game improves on the Witch's brew mechanic in that it's not all or nothing, but it's still very powerful.

A condensed Uwe Rosenberg resource conversion game that plays in about one hour, fits in a small table, and plays well with two: Great for workday gaming with the wife !

The card selection system forces a lot of interaction between players, and competition for buildings is still there at the 2p count.

Look forward to explore it further.

RATING: 8.5
A fairly fast-playing game with limited downtime between turns, interesting decisions, and a lot of variety in the buildings. It is a very "puzzle-y" game that can at times be frustrating, but makes for a great, fun challenge.

The card play allows for a good deal of interaction. In a two-player game, you each select five cards (out of fifteen available) before the round starts. You take turns playing a card. If you are the only person with that card in hand when you play it, you get to do both actions listed on the card. If your opponent has the same card in hand when you play yours, they are also able to play it on your turn, and each of you only gets to pick one of the two available actions. The round ends when one person has no more cards left. So, you really need to pay careful attention to your opponent. You are trying to strike a balance between choosing cards you don't think he/she will choose, so you can get the maximum benefit from the card, and choosing cards you think he/she will play, so that you can piggyback on those actions and also keep the person from gaining both of the card's benefits. 

I love how the resource wheels are implemented. They are a big part of the "puzzle" of the game. Basically, you have two wheels: one that simulates your glass production, and one for your brick production. You start the game with some resources, and as you acquire them and move them along your wheel, the wheel will turn forward when you have enough resources to produce a batch of glass or brick. You cannot prevent this from happening. Thematically, I see it as you are overseeing both of these businesses and your land, and when you gather resources to be delivered to the glass or brick producers, and have paid them with food, they then go to work right away. So that might not seem like a big deal--after all, you want to make glass and brick. However, you will need the resources throughout the game to build buildings, pay for certain specialists to provide you with actions (the cards), or to convert into other resources or points using building powers. So, when the wheel turns to simulate production, your 1 clay, 1 charcoal, and 1 food will suddenly turn into brick, and you will have zero of each good. You might have needed that one food to play the builder specialist card. You can only produce and store three glass and three brick at any one time, which means you might want to spend them to build buildings and keep your production lines flowing. Anyway, it is quite a puzzle.

There are three different types of buildings--ones that give you production powers you can use whenever you would like once you've built them, ones that grant a one-time bonus, and ones that give you additional ways to score points at the end of the game. You are building these buildings on your land, which at the beginning of the game is comprised of forests, ponds, sand pits, and groves. So your land is a puzzle all its own. You will need to clear land to make room for buildings, and also adapt your landscape to maximize the powers of the buildings you build. You might get points for each pond adjacent to the building, or for each connected sand pit you have on your land. Some buildings allow you to instantly add landscape to your land once built, while others will allow you to destroy certain landscape to gain resources instead. So the buildings you choose to build often force you to manipulate your land in a certain way.

All of our plays have been around 45 minutes with two players.

A bit over-hyped game in my opinion. A lot of randomness both in the buildings that are in play as well as the cards the players can play but at least it plays very quickly.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
It's good. It has simple mechanisms. It's easy to teach. And yet, it has solid gameplay.

I've only played solo and with four players. With four players and a large table, I couldn't really see what anyone was doing, and I didn't really have a good idea what they would go for, so the whole "pick X number of cards that will match and Y number that won't match your opponents selection" was largely thrown out of the window. I suspect that the game will actually be a more social experience with two players, than it is with four, since you'll be able to really pay attention to what they're working on. And without thinking about it at all, with four players, I'd say that I got an average of 4 cards played each round. It would probably be hard to do significantly better than that.

Really, the only part the other players had for me was in the choice of order of playing my cards, since cards are "in danger" while they are in your hand. So you want to play things in priority order, rather than in optimal order.

Ultimately, not a big issue since the game is still good and fairly short (even including the rules explanation). But expect to have it be multiplayer solitaire unless you're playing with two.

My only other thought on the game is one thing I noticed in the rules which is that the first player token simply rotates in 2 and 4 player modes. In a 3 player game, on the 4th round the player who is last in scoring gets to go first. That's a bit... Well, I feel like there had to be a better solution than that. This seems like it would be annoying no matter what, because everyone has to compute their score one round before having to compute their score AGAIN, for the end of the game. And then, if the scores were anything like close to each other at the end of the third round, it's entirely conceivable that the player who was furthest in back might win the game due to getting the first player bonus on hitting the market.

Personally, the stop-to-score element bugs me more, but I'm sure there are lots of people who would be annoyed at having the single-person-target catch-up mechanism that might overshoot.

It would have been better if Uwe had used a bidding mechanism or told the first player to lose two resources and the second player to lose one resource, at the start the fourth round, or something. Or maybe put out three tiles and let the players each pick one in reverse turn order.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
A light and fun game, especially with two. It offers the crunchy decisions of a longer resource euro, but plays in half the time. 

The variable nature of the buildings, especially the end of scoring buildings, change things up just enough to make each play feel different. That said, the variability has been overstated a bit. Many of the buildings are merely slight variations on a theme (gather 4 sand tiles for 4 VP, gather 4 lake tiles for 4 VP, etc). 

Criticisms related solely to initial plays -- forcing new players to preprogram the first 5 actions in the game can be a bit overwhelming for some. It takes about half a play to really become familiar with the cards on offer too. Still, saying the game offer room for growth and familiarity is never really a negative.

Rosenberg's designs have not been my cup of English Breakfast since....oh....Bohnanza.  Hence Glass Road was something of a pleasant surprise.  

As so often before, Glass Road is about resource harvesting and conversion, this time into buildings that score victory points.  It even has individual player boards, to which I am practically allergic.  

What Glass Road does right, in my view, is to keep the resource business simple.  The two dials help with that, as well as surprising the unwary by automatically converting basic resources into brick and glass.  I also like the Witch's Brew card play whereby you can reduce the effectiveness of other players' actions and leech off them.  Plus, Glass Road zips along at  good pace and doesn't outstay its welcome.

Production quality is good.  The artwork is unexciting but quite pleasing to the eye.

Another eurogame from Mr.Rosenberg where you collect resources in order to build various buildings with different abilities and VP values.

Rated 6 after first play, but even that takes into account the fact I usually like this designer and would play again to see if I missed something. I found it too random: too many buildings to plan for (and they need planning); and the card selection mechanism (where the effects vary depending on whether someone else has chosen some of the same 5 out of 15 cards) is, I would say, impossible to predict, it's just a stab in the dark. Ends up being pretty random and short term tactics dominate.

Uwe's take on Role Selection and it's a much faster experience with all of the same depth as his other big boxes. The resource wheel mechanic and spatial element remind me of Ora et Labora, but they are very distinct in their implementation here.

Nice gameplay which in the early plays feels a little too opportunistic for my tastes - that may change with experience.

Good game that my wife likes more than I do.  I enjoy the card action selection mechanism, managing my player board spaces, and having to keep track of two resource dials.  What I don't enjoy as much is the boring resource conversion nature of the building tiles.  I just find resource conversion, presented in such an obvious and deliberate way, to be rather dry.  Still, I'll play if it she wants to and she's asked that I keep it.

Glass Road was fun the first time we played it at a demo during DTC 2014. We bought it not long after but found it lacking in one major aspect. We played it with a 5 player compliment but we usually only play bu ourselves (two-player) and it just doesn't work that well for 2. And it relies a lot on the interaction with the players for the playing of character cards to perform actions. And as stated we typically just have only the 2 of us so that interaction kind of falls away making the game a bit of a slog to play through. Otherwise it is a fine game. The massive number of components that Uwe normally stuffs his game boxes with is replaced by a resource wheel. You manipulate that wheel to get more of one resource which will in turn use up another as you move the dial. It is a really good system for resource management. 
So as stated a very good game with interesting mechanisms but best played with more than 2 players.

wasnt expecting owe to surprise me that much again, interesting system for goods, also i'm a big fan of "simultaneous action selection" (not exactly that in this case) but you have to try to guess what other people will play, it's fun, would play again

Wow.  This is a really tight role selection game that is very simple at it's core but has a surprising amount of depth.  Best part is with experience people who don't have AP, you can probably finish this in an hour.

I love the resource tracking mechanism, but the fact that it automatically moves, also creates some interesting scenarios where you need to block with coal/food (available on both tracks).

Rosenberg-farm elements, played out through role selection.  Benefits to players that select cards that others select, in a "Citadels done right" kind of way.

Glass Road is a solid game that is largely fueled by simultaneous card play. Finding the right combinations of buildings and cards to play is really fun. The adjusting resource markets make the game really interesting. The card play might be what fuels the game, but manipulating your resources is where the game becomes really fascinating. I'm very interested to give this another try.

Sometimes I feel like raging after playing a game like this because of the amazingly boring themes. "Glass road", okay. Still, we gather wood, stone and clay to build houses on our nice little fields. 

This doesnt affect the gameplay, obviously, but it makes the whole thing boring. The game itself has some neat mechanics like the ressource wheels which appear complicated at first, but are quite elegant actually. The interaction with choosing the right cards is also fun, even though this has been done better (and with a superior theme) in Asgard last year.

Really really hard to visualise the effects of moves.  I don't think any of us had a good handle on what would happen to our resources - those rotating hands are fiendish.   I could enjoy the challenge of getting better at this game.  How we could all end up on 18 points at the end defies logic.  Perhaps tending towards hard work??  Seems to be very difficult to score many points, as no single scoring area can dominate.

Certainly the most unique of Uwe Rosenberg's 'big games'. It features two mechanisms that aren't commonly found elsewhere. First is the brick and glass resource wheels and their 'auto-generation' (when you get at least one of the input goods, you MUST produce one manufactured good, to a limit for three manufactured goods). It provides an interesting extra wrinkle in the resource producing puzzle.

The other mechanism is the action selection system, which (as acknowledged in the rules) is also found, in a modified form, in Broom Service. Each player has a deck of 15 cards, each with 2 actions, one on the top and one on the bottom. For each round chooses 5 cards and sets aside the rest. Then for each turn (there are 3 per round) player choose one card to play for that turn. Starting with the round's start player, they reveal their selected card and ask if anybody else has the card in their hand. If nobody else has it, they can do both actions; but if somebody has, then the current player does only one action, and the following player takes another action. Note that each player can follow only two times each round

I think that, if you internalize the system, there is great depth for strategic (in the card choices in each round) and tactical (in making card choices in each turn) planning. But the number and complexity of the role cards makes it hard to learn and especially internalized, so it can feel like you are just randomly choosing cards.

As for the rest, it's typical euro game tropes, if individual player board, engine building and resource conversion. Sometimes I like these tropes and sometimes I don't; with this game I like it because the game is quite concise in it length and components, which I appreciate.

I've also been pleasantly surprise how well it played with two players. Here there is no simultaneous turn selection; instead, each player will choose cards (and possibly follow) until one player runs out of cards. I think since there is only one opponent to consider, it makes it easier to try and outthink your opponent.

I love the rondel, and the automatic goods conversion; this requires a more careful planning.
Also, the bluffing part is actually fun and tense.

The first game (2 player) felt a bit short; though, I believe that it would actually hurt the game if lengthened.

Hands down, the best "complex Rosenberg" game out there. Much, much better than his boring "tons of options" alternatives; this one actually limits the options you have, but gives you very tight choices in an also great economic engine. Plus, the outguessing portion of the mechanisms works really great here.

RATING: 8
Delicious choices.  Select 5 cards from your set of 15.  You get to play three of them.  If unique choices you get two uses.  If someone else has chosen and have in their hand they get to play also.  Nice decisions on what and when to play.  The tiles are reasonable intuitive once the game starts.  But the text on the tiles is too small (in common with many other new games).  There should be law banning use of anything less than 8.5 point.  Very polished design as you would expect from Uwe Rosenberg.  I am not a fan of some of Uwe's more involved games (Ora et Labora), but this hit the sweet spot.

A very good mechanic on the wheel regarding the production of the higher level resources. Other than that, at the first play it seems like a good abstraction of other Rosenberg games. The fact that the game is relatively short does not contribute to the gaming experience in comparison with Uwe's caverna that was released simultaneously. However, if you are looking for a short family game with interaction and depth, this game is for you.

Glass Road is one of the two big box games designed by Uwe Rosenberg in 2013, and it surely is the most peculiar of the two: while it can seem another game in the camp of the resource converters Uwe is a master at, it is quite short and has at its core a couple of interesting and different enough mechanics to stand out.

First mechanic is more a "technological" innovation: the two wheels used for managing resources are quite clever and very functional, saving many minutes of playing time.

On the other hand, the role selection and interaction is very interesting and interactive, and it's the true engine of the game.

A couple of things keep Glass Road from being a super-duper game: it's thematically very dry and disconnected, and it has a banned building (Roofing Company) that slipped through playtesting.

Overall is a very good game, and the initial rating (7.5) could realistically go up if it plays well with two.

In Glass Road, you start the game by making a random decision on which building(s) to build.  Sometimes a combo might present itself... or not.  Basically you're at the mercy of the draw.  I'd prefer beginning, middle, and late buildings.

I like the card selection and card play.  The glass and brick conversion is mostly interesting.  Overall, Glass Road is probably worth 3-9 total plays, much like Loyang or Merkator.

Het spel is prachtig om naar te kijken, met al die kleuren.  Evenzo de leuke mechaniek van de grondstofklok.
Heeft elementen van puerto rico (ga voor de juiste combi van gebouwen), doch bevat meer geluksfactoren, want niet alle gebouwen liggen onmiddellijk uit.
Daardoor is het spel ook elke keer geheel anders.

Je kiest 5 rollen uit 15 kaarten, en dit 4 keer.
Je speelt de rollen één voor één, maar hebt behoorlijke interactie met de medespelers.  De juiste gebouwen zijn al weg, of je kan niet de grondstof pakken die je nodig hebt.

Lijkt me ook wel leuk voor 1 speler.  Eens te proberen!

Ik was fan van bij de eerste speelbeurt!

Juho hit the nail on the head when he said that it takes the lead/follow aspect of Race for the Galaxy (or more similarly, Glory to Rome), and puts it in the service of a complex resource conversion game.

First off, you must play with the 5th round, it makes the game more satisfying. For me, this is the least favorite of Uwe's big games. I'm not sure what it is. Something about the role selection and not being to calculate your gains each turn. It could be that I haven't played it enough to figure out how to select 3 roles that others won't choose and 2 that they will, but each game I've played I've been left frustrated rather than satisfied.

"Analysis Paralysis" game. People who like to plan ahead and try to calculate how everything is going to unfold.
Its very hard to do this because of the wheel and if you have many buildings that can convert goods. Nice looking game with uniqe wheel. The 2 best things with the game is to choose cards and see if other player picked your cards, and collect resorces. Its fun to use your board with things
The 2 worst things is that the buildings i to smal, and the text. hard to see (and they can upsidedown from where you sitting), its hard to calculate then. They are so nice looking art but you hardly see it. The 2 thing is that its to mutch Analysis Paralysis even without the wheel sometimes. I am forked aboaut the game.

This game scales very well. Including the solo variant. The game offers a nice degree of strategic game play while still staying at an hour or less. That's very rare. The components and art are perfect for the theme. Love the action selection via the cards, as you try to predict what your opponent is going to do. There are some tough choices as, like many resource management games, you don't have time to do everything. When you don't have time for something heavier, this is a good choice.

Another Uwe game. This one fine tunes the resource wheel mechanism found in Ora & Labora. You need to keep your resources flowing if you want to get the good tiles on your board. I also really enjoy the card playing system, as it adds a little push your luck. This is on the lighter end of Rosenberg's games, so it would work well for an introduction to meatier games like Agricola, Le Havre, Caverna, etc.

Another solid game from Uwe. Not sure I would rate it as highly as Agricola or Le Havre, thanks mainly to the blind play mechanism, but I guess you have to sacrifice a little something to make the game lighter. Certainly worth another play or two before I make up my mind.

After second play it still stands up, but not sure I can see much beyond going for the scoring buildings. For the first time I really saw somebody work the blue buildings for lots of resources but they still ended up behind me and my tiny handful of scoring buildings.

I really don't get the appeal of this game either.  The resource wheel is KINDA interesting and I like the use of role cards.  There just isn't a whole lot going on here.  When it's over you're kinda like..."that's it???".  It's just another game of gathering resources with specific roles.  I can think of tons of other Euro's I'd rather play instead of this.  This game gets by on name recognition alone.  It's not very good.

A good role selection, economic, puzzle game that can be a brain-burner for new players.  Essentially, it's a game about converting resources into buildings or other resources so you can earn victory points.  A central feature and tricky part of the game is that you secretly pick 5 roles and then gradually play 3 of them per round as actions, and you hope to get bonus actions by matching your 4th or 5th cards with roles that opponents choose to play as one of their 3 actions.  Another trick is in figuring out how to stay out of your own way because when you produce a rare resource, your goods wheel turns and you consume/destroy your basic resources.  Most buildings require both rare and basic resources so, if your not careful, you may end up consuming your entire supply of a basic resource required to make that building this round.

UPDATE #1: I still really enjoy the challenge of this game, but I worry that it's imbalanced toward the person who matches card choices with opponents and gets extra actions.  The final scores are often very low (~20-30) and close together, thus 1/2 points and extra actions are a big deal.

UPDATE #2: Perhaps the game is not imbalanced but just heavily rewards players who are paying close attention to what other players are doing and what they need/want for their success (rather than playing in isolation as multi-player solitaire and hoping that you match enough cards to maximize your number of actions in this short #turns game).  Being attentive to game situations of other players can be difficult in my regular group due to distractions (noise, music, lighting, chatting, and late arrivals) and the distance between player boards/wheels relative to the small iconography for building costs, conversion abilities on tiles, etc.  The bottom line is that I think the game shines when played in an intimate setting with a small table and focused players, and in the absence of this setting the game feels luck-heavy, doesn't gel or chain nicely, and is not as much fun.

Nice work from Uwe! I really like it, but only one other fella from my group has learned it and I fear that it may be too much for some of the others to enjoy.  It needs a few plays to grok it, but once you do, it's depth and quick pace deliver a sweet experience.  I traded it away, but am delighted to hear rumours about his upgraded version called Black Forest.  Insta-buy!

Deep in the north-east bavarian forest, there were many worker-huts with hot furnaces. These men were experts in manufacturing the green glass, for which these area got famous in the 19th century. And Uwe Rosenberg is an expert author for a short, good game, that has nothing in common with his other games of the past. So now we had to think around the corner, when we wish to get some extra actions (do you know citadels without the murderer?)!
And for the balance of experienced players: The building "Roofing Company" (Dachdeckerei) should be taken from the game. OFFICIAL ERRATA. Add on: Oktoberfest tile.

10x10 2014. I love Uwe Rosenberg games, and Ora et Labora in particular.  And this game reminds me of Ora in several ways- the goods on the wheels (although it's used pretty differently here than in Ora) and building your own little town.  So I wanted this to be Ora light and I think this is about as close as any game is going to come to that experience in a short (approximately 1 hr or faster for 2p) time frame.  The card play is interesting and the mechanic where you can play cards when others play them, or if you play them and no one else has them you get a bigger benefit is neat.  Also the mechanic of the glass works and brick works advancing the wheel- running automatically basically is neat.  It's a really slick way to use one of a bunch of stuff to make one really good thing.  Although forcing them to run whenever possible does feel a little wonky sometimes since it will occasionally mess up your plans.  The game ends a little quickly but you can play an extra round, as it says in the rule book, for a longer game.

So happy I finally decided to get a copy.  It's a Rosenberg harvest game, but it's a quick one and it's also got a very nice Witches' Brew mechanic where players choose a subset of cards to determine their actions and then get bonus actions for outguessing what actions their opponents are going to choose.  It takes his normal harvest games and makes them more interactive.  A fairly quick playtime (~1 hour) makes this even better.

Decent game but definitely my least favorite Rosenberg. Never felt like you were able to 'get ahead' due to the mechanic of the commodity wheel. Glass and Brick weren't satisfyingly more powerful than the other commodities you get far easier. 

Not bad, relatively quick which is good. May go up on a replay but right now I'd rather try a different game than play again.

One play. 2 player game, which was ok and really wanted to play with 3 players, thinking the card selection would be more interesting. Plenty of buildings, so good replayability, but the brief play time of only 4 building rounds seemed to tight to allow building up to getting the scoring bonuses. I think 5 rounds will be used from now on, according to the variant. I like to play time of 45 minutes for our 2 player game, but wouldn't mind it going to an hour.

This gets better every time I play it.

Rated for the app. This rating may change a lot, MORE DATA REQUIRED in a big way, because the app is so terrible that I've never seen my final score in a game, it just keeps freezing on me. Still, if I'm rating the game and not the app.... then I really really REALLY enjoy this so far. Wowza, it's cool, can't wait to find a way to play this on the table. I end up not liking themeless euros a lot, and while the theme of this is unique (which is nice), it's just not that exciting? I still like it though, and it might, along with Pillars of the Earth, begin to break my dislike of generic medieval themes, something that even Orleans couldn't do.

RATING: 1
The worst game of 2013 possibly. Soulless, themeless maneuvering for nothing. Sometimes little control of which actions you get or lose when a matching card has been played.

Boring resource conversion + boring buildings.

It was so bad that I had to beg for the game to be abandoned.

Rosenberg is recycling the same mechanics and this was gratingly awful. This game wouldn't be receiving these kind of ratings were it not for the author's name. If Joe Blow was the designer, the real rating would be much lower.

Another excellent game from Mr. Rosenberg! Not quite as deep as Agricola or Le Havre (or even Gates of Loyang for that matter) but it has lots of decision making needed, a fun "I might get to do more if you let me" factor, and it's tough to get points - but in a good brain burning kind of way. And great bits! Recommended!

I really enjoyed this game, it plays similar to Ora et Labora but with a 1 hour play time.

Some people in my game group have started to comment that they think this game is too short, there is too much too do and too little time to do it in... I think thats one of the great things about this game. It brings an almost sense of almost desperation that I really enjoy.

A considerably shorter Uwe game, Glass Road excels where the rest don't: Time. 5 cards per round, 4 rounds per game and that's *it*. 20 minutes per player... tops. Takes a similar amount of time to Le Havre: The Inland Port, and is comparably good. Hard to pick a favourite out of the two.

RATING: 8.5
I am loving this new trend of card-driven, hand management Euros (Rococo, Lewis & Clark, Concordia, City of Iron): it feels like worker placement but adds the more interactive feeling of trying to predict and benefit from your opponents' actions. 

Glass Road stands out by adding in the spatial and production elements of Rosenberg's earlier designs (Ora & Labora), not to mention the coolest, most ingenious resource tracker I've ever seen in a board game: the first time you make brick or glass, you will "ooh" and "aah" at the magical wheel. I also like that for once you don't have to feed your stupid family.

RATING: 6
A neat little game of resource management through card play and buying of buildings with all sorts of special abilities that can act in various ways.

On one hand, it all works well, but on the other hand, I feel like it's a game that really didn't do much to innovate, which left me a little unexcited.  None the less, it's fun to juggle around the resources and figure out how to best navigate our desired path, just nothing mind blowing that would make me choose it over many other games.

The one neat aspect is the card play.  Every round, you choose 5 cards to play.  When someone plays a card and you have it in your hand, you must follow them, allowing each of you to take a weak version of that action.  However, if no one follows, the player that played the card gets a much stronger version of the action.  Thus, you're always looking at what you think other players might do, and trying to do what's best for you as well as what you think other players may not be interested in.

Overall, there's a neat little twist in the card play, but the rest is your very standard resource manipulation.  Good to check out, but for me, it's nothing excitingly new although it is fine to play.

Uwe has thing where he designs games that revolve around semi-realistically manipulating real world ingredients and I just enjoy that.

Unlike most of his games of this sort, the game isn't about blocking, but rather about leeching. And leeching properly is critical, since the most actions you can get in a turn is 8, but the lowest is 3. There is a big difference between 8 and 3.

I also appreciate that you won't see all the buildings every game, and I felt like I needed to try and build a strategy around the buildings I bought at the beginning of the game.

RATING: 3
Like Rosenberg's Ora, this is an opaque solitaire puzzle game of resource manipulation and conversion. The amount of permutations generated by the large number of resources and actions, and their interactions with each other and with the seemingly endless amount of buildings is just absurd. 

There really aren't the guiding principles of something like Chess to pare down the decision trees and the scope of the information overload either. It amounts to flailing around and stabbing in the dark. 

The cardplay seems like it would be an interesting source of interaction, but it isn't. Since you barely have what you could even plausibly call a tenuous handle on your own actions, how can you possibly make an educated guess as to someone else's intentions? And then as people acquire VP buidlings, it becomes obvious which action cards they have to select every time to acquire VPs, so there really is no decision there either. There isn't much interesting middle ground.

I play with people who like Rosenberg's games, so I have to keep playing them. And I do well against those people (all strong players), so I don't feel like I'm missing anything. I just think the emperor is buck naked and some people get a thrill out of fondling his balls.

RATING: 7
I love Uwe’s games - Agricola being my favorite game of all time. This one is much lighter than many of his other “big” games, but it’s actually quite good, especially considering how short it is. Actually, the first time I played it I thought we played it wrong (which we did not) because it was over in like 30 minutes. This obviously also means that you don’t really get to do a whole lot in the game, but it works just fine as a short, light game.

The gears and how you produce resources is a neat mechanic just like the three types of buildings (instant ressources, conversion buildings and end game buildings). But there is no doubt that the greatest feature of Glass Road is the card mechanic itself! GR rewards you for choosing cards which the other players are going to play and for playing cards yourself which they haven’t chosen… So you really need to evaluate the situation of each player and try to outthink them (which also creates some subtle player interaction)! Because if you play a card nobody else has chosen, you get both of the actions on the cards. And if you can match one of their cards, you both get to do just one of the actions. This of course means that it’s crucial to pick the right cards. Some might think it’s random which player chooses which cards, but I highly disagree – it’s most certainly possible to estimate which cards other players are likely to play (if he doesn’t have any type of one resource he might play that, or if he has a lot of lakes he might play the card which gives him x number of sand or water for the number of lakes etc).

The downtime is minimal because the game is so fast and because you choose cards simultaneously. I’ve tried it with 2,3 and 4, and while 2 player works a little differently, all player counts work well. Some minor niggles are that it can be a little hard to choose cards and which resources you need to produce glass and bricks. And when you have one of each resource, the wheel turns which might not be what you wanted, but it can happen if another player plays a card. You can also get a little screwed if another player plays (especially) a building card before you wanted to because you don’t have the resources at that time, or you thought you would get both actions etc, but that’s pretty cool. 

The buildings themselves aren’t that interesting. Those that convert aren’t used too often I find as they don’t provide any points, and as the game is over so quickly they rarely get used a lot. Those that grant an instant bonus, well, they just provide you with an immediate bonus and then they’re worth nothing afterwards (except for the points of course). The end game buildings are very important and help you shape your strategy, so it’s a pain in the ass when another player grabs the building you had your eyes on! I think it was a little weird that there were so few buildings available and that so rather few new buildings came out each round. But all in all GR is a good, although not great, game.

There is a difficulty to plan with the lack of information pertaining to the building draw. The gameplay is getting repetitive and is a nuisance to play with the resource wheels and keep track of resources. I like the card action and selection part of the game. Still an ok game that I wouldn't mind playing, but I have no desire to own it again.

Based on my initial play, this game has a lot of potential.  It has the strategy and feel of Uwe Rosenberg's games without a lot of the complexity.  Glass Road has fascinating mechanics, a large dose of strategy, beautiful design, and easy-to-explain rules.

RATING: 7
The main strength of this game, to me, is its length. This does seen to be a basic cube-exchanger, but it does seriously end at right about an hour. The main mechanism of playing cards and hopefully getting an extra benefit by not having others pick your card is neat, and makes you really pay attention and not play solitaire. I do think the main gameplay ultimately isn't really that satisfying and the random buildings might dictate the winner more than I'd like. I did enjoy the production wheels.

Rosenberg tends to be more "miss" than "hit" for me. I really like Ora et Labora, my few plays of Le Havre were okay, I'll play Caverna if someone wants, and I'll avoid Agricola.

So, Glass Road was a pleasant surprise. My buddy described it as "Ora lite" and that surprisingly seems about right. You've got the dials for semi-automated resource management, buildings and terrain placed on a grid where placement and adjacency can matter, but actions are chosen via card play and trying to guess what other players will choose so that you can piggyback on actions. All this happens in four quick rounds.

It's not a light game, but it's certainly very approachable. I'd gladly play this again.

RATING: 9
This game is delightful. It plays quickly, so much variety in the number of buildings, and tough decisions on what 5 workers to hopefully use each turn. The number of buildings means the replayability is going to be high even without the fear of an expansion. I have played a couple games now (2 and 3 players) and have been able to use a completely different strategy each time.

The resource dials are incredibly neat and add a sense of calculation to the game, which normally I don't like but didn't bother me here. I want to see how this plays solo to try different strategies. If it plays well solo, this may very well become a 10 game for me.

For the Glass Road, it is actually a basic role selection and resources changing game.  The bombardment of the role selection is much more interesting than the materials changing wheel.  Of course, the wheel makes the games very neat to handle the force trade between the raw materials and high values products. 
Hard to plan in the game; the bonus tile you want may also be the target from other players.  Players have to switch their objective dynamically.  I can say the game may be better if it has 1 or 2 additional rounds or the players have their own private tiles on hand at the very beginning of the game.   The wheel streamlines the stock keeping of materials but I like the ideas of the role selection conflicts.  The ways to play this game may be a big difference if there are only 2 players.  What if the roles in the game reduced to 10 and decrease the types of materials.   Or say just focus on Glass and use only one wheel...  If it becomes a light Euro games, it may be much better or (I can say) may be much more suitable for me!

Rating and comments for the solo game. This is a hard solo experience, with a reasonable learning curve. It is not a straightforward solo, like Agricola, because you have to understand how various elements intertwine: the production wheels, the distribution of actions on the cards, the currency exchange rate, the hand size limitations and more. There are plenty of paths to explore, and a lot of control that can be exercised regardless of the luck of the tile draw. One weak point is that your score does depend on the seeding of the board, so to improve your top score, you have to be skilled but also lucky to get a good draw. A very enjoyable, quick to setup, small footprint game that is unlike anything else in my collection. Overall, a great solo experience and worth the admission ticket alone.

First play. Didn't quite live up to my expectations, which were perhaps a bit too high. There are so many tiles to build (the whole point of the game), and you don't see them until they come out, and they do so many different things, that it feels like you don't really even know what game you're playing until it unfolds in front of you. For some reason I expected a more in depth game. With multiple resource wheels and tons of different resources and zillions of ways to transmute them. There's a hefty dose of randomness and chaos. I look forward to playing more, but I may have to rejigger my expectations for what kind of game this is.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A friendly game of simple resource conversion in the spirit of Le Havre and Ora & Labora, but then over and done in under an hour. Perfect for fraidy cats and dumbos like me who have trouble playing the Big Games because of not being able to easily visualise the conversion chains. Glass Road quickly offers a lot of resources, doesn't overstay its welcome with tons of game rounds, doesn't ask difficult questions of you. There are circumstances in which I want to be asked these questions, but not with resource conversion and mild snowballing. 

What struck me most during my first game is that the fear I had of undesired clashes in the card play has been shrewdly manipulated by Uwe in that you actually [i]want[/i] some clashes and some uniqueness: it's the only way in which you get to play more than 3 out your 5 chosen characters. Thank you for that very simple and effective twist to make what would have otherwise been a painful process, Uwe. As soon as that cloud evaporated, I found myself even enjoying Glass Road... more than I thought I would, in any case. As I said, you shouldn't take this game all too seriously if you have the aforementioned Big Box games by Uwe for breakfast. I think a better yardstick is your appreciation of his lighter titles: Loyang and Merkator. Glass Road is like that: stuff distilled down to (a lot of) their essence. 

I think I can even see this game enter my collection at some point in the future. Not at full price point (sorry, Uwe) because in the end it is still resource conversion which is not a game mechanism I generally have much patience with. But still, there aren't many games which do what Glass Road does. And that is something which ought to be rewarded.

[b]Update[/b] Got the game sometime later (at reduced price point, it was on sale), and played it. It remains a friendly game most of the people I've introduced it to seem to like. Not great, not particularly good or special, but charming in its own sweet inoffensive way. It's a good game to bring to meetings which don't happen often. Increased the rating by 1.

This is not a bad game by any means, but there were a couple of problems which kept it from hitting the table much at our house:

1. The game ends before it feels like it should. The rulebook includes a variant to add a round for a longer game, but even at this the game end seems abrupt - like how Agricola ends just as your farm is really starting to run smoothly, only worse. (We even tried with +2 rounds, which was better but the ending still left something to be desired.)

2. There are a bunch of tiles, all with small text, and it's tough for all players to see them from across the table. It's also hard to formulate an overall strategy while trying to read and comprehend the tiles.

I really like the resource dials. They are a clever mechanic, but in the end they weren't enough to prop up the game. Traded away.

One of my favourite games to come out of Essen 2013. It's like a composite of my favourite parts of Agricola and Race for the Galaxy, two of my favourite games. Highly recommended. Whilst Caverna seems to be getting all the love, this is the more elegant and interesting game. Caverna is just Agricola with a few fixes and a few bits broken.

Tried a demonstrative game @ ModenaPlay 2015: despite my expectations being quite hight, I didn't have much fun in playing this Uwe Rosemberg homage to the Bavarian glass making industry. I found the mechanics quite sloppy and the building numbers and long-term features are rather inconsistant considering how short the game actually is.

Too short of a game to be 'epic' good...but a good game. Resource management with 2 production wheels, area/tile management. No worker placement per se, but a unique card play instead.

RATING: 6
Components: Nice art; clear iconography. Sturdy components.

Experience: Really tough to wrap my brain around. The resource wheels seem opaque just for opaqueness's sake. I think I'm missing a piece of the theme here, but having two separate wheels, and forcing me to convert my resources into brick/glass, even at inopportune moments, just feels weird and difficult to understand.

On a first play, there was just too much information: too many cards to choose from; too many buildings. And it's not easy to see a production chain. At one point I wanted to clear a forest so that I could connect two ponds. To do that, I had to select cards to get the right resources to build a building that would allow me to clear forests, and then I had to select the cards to give me the resources to build the building that cared about ponds; and then of course I had to build the pond itself. That was basically half my game, just to get four points.

This game takes quite a bit of planning and thinking to decided what 5 cards of the 15 you are playing for each third of the period.  Then it does not play out in a straight forward manner because if another player plays the same card, you can only do half the actions.  It is just annoying.  Also the resource wheel is annoying in that when you make a brick or glass, you lose 1 each of the other resources on that wheel.  It is just hard to keep track of the resources you need and be efficient about the whole resource management mechanic.  I really was not enjoying my first game (2 player), so me and my friend quit after the first period.

RATING: 5
Sort of a secret role selection mixed with the "play off others' actions" similar to that of Race for the Galaxy. Unlike RFTG, there is a lot of emphasis put on the order of one's card play, as resources are automatically spent to make brick and glass once that becomes possible. There is a common pool of buildings that are the main source of VPs, as well as buildings which provide either a one-time or anytime bonus action(s). 

If you like a lot of control in your games, you might want to stay away from this one.

Resource management is made complex with the double rondels. Art and components are nice but the theme is really dull as typical of Uwe's games. The short play time of this makes this game stand out though. Replayability added through random tile draw. Some aspects of tableau building.

RATING: 7.5
After 3 plays; 1 play @ 2 players, 2 plays @ 1 player

A decent resource puzzle where you try to build up your town for points while managing a two production wheels and a half dozen resources. Players can try to anticipate and chain off the actions of another player to accomplish more in a round. This chaining action seems to screw the first player more since later players will be out of cards sooner. Since the game only lasts four rounds, it can be painful to be first. 

I actually enjoyed the game more solo. Without the action chaining, the game has more of a puzzle feel where you're trying to do the most with the tiles available and manage the resources in the best way. 

I would play again if someone wanted to play but not one that I'm interested in adding to my collection.

I really like Uwe's games, and this one is no exception.  At first I was overwhelmed by the card selection process, but after a few turns it all clicked.  Finding building combos and maximizing your score is really fun.  The resource wheels can be hard to wrap your head around.  Don't forget to calculate the loss of the other goods as you gain a glass or a brick, I was burned by this more than once.

RATING: 7
Some people have objected to the Witch's Brew-like action mechanism, though I kind of dig it (I like Wie verhext, after all).  Some people have objected to the auto-cube converter track, though I found it fun and thematic.  My real problem with this game is actually something others would find a feature, which is that a handful of times during my two plays I was finally set to build a bonus building, the key to my strategy, only to have it taken right before I could.  In other games you are simply forced to adapt when this happens; to find a new strategy, or go to a plan B.  And while you still do that here, the bonus buildings are so random and possibly disparate that you really can't take advantage of your infrastructure the same way.  To me it makes what should be a great strategy game into an ok tactical game.  I still give it a bump for the fun mechanisms, however.

Rosenberg enters role selection and knocks it out of the park.  This is one of our favorite games; somehow it just *works*.

The game pulls in two different directions - it wants to be a quick-playing light and frothy Euro but then poses quite fiddly and complex resource gathering, VP conversion calculations that builds AP into the heart of the game. However, if you just ditch the quick playing bit and go whole hog with it as a brain-burner, it then ladles a large dollop of randomness/luck into the game in the form of whether you second-guess the cards others have chosen and therefore get to play off other peoples cards or not. 

The theme is, as usual for these kinds of Euros, nowhere really. There is also such a wide variety of buildings that there is lots of peering at what's available and how that ties in with the choice of 15 cards, and I can't see this diminishing even with repeated plays.

The resource wheel mechanism is very clever and the game is wonderfully produced with lots of nice art and chunky bits of cardboard. These two factors contribute an extra 0.5 to my rating but underneath it's just another Euro and rather dull.

Certainly one of Uwe's best games. Plays fast, some interesting decisions and a cool role selection mechanism. I really like the meta-game aspect of the role selection. On on hand you want to be able to leech on the other players selections but still want to be alone on your vital ones as you get to do both actions on the card if alone with it and only one otherwise.

Much lighter fare and much more random than his other games, but since it plays in under an hour it doesn't bother me.

It definitely is a Rosenberg game. Same art style as well. I did find that the rondelle was a bit cumbersome to play. It had good mechanics though and was fun to build the buildings.

RATING: 7
Players are glass manufacturers in Bavaria.

Pleasant, fast playing game where players select five role cards, from a hand of fifteen, to play out a round.  There are four of these rounds in the game.  Players select a role and action it, but if other players have that role in their hand, they reveal it and leech an action off the phasing player.  Actions are typical spend stuff to gain stuff things - resources that are tracked on a pair of production wheels that manufacture brick and glass automatically when the resources are present.

Resources are tapped back into buildings that are constructed on a player's board.  These grant abilities and victory points at the end of the game.

This is a chewy, meaty one hour game that just ... isn't that much fun.  It's well designed, but the scoring and game play is so constrained and tight, having your actions leeched can mean the difference between a victory and a loss.  We got eight plays out of it - and surprisingly found the two player game better than the four player game.  

Worth a look but ultimately not for us.

It's like a cross between Witch's Brew and Ora&Labor Junior.   The wheel mechanism is clever, as producing glass and brick costs you a different combination of other resources which will vary each time due to token placement when the wheel closes up the gaps.   There seems to be a wide variety of buildings to keep it varied.   It has some of the trademark Uwe oddities, and that's likely part of the appeal.  Plays pretty quickly, so that's a nice feature.   Doesn't completely light me on fire, but I don't mind playing it either.   Almost the textbook definition of a "middle of the road" 7 for me.

I think the main criticism that I have is that the game doesn't really have any sense of theme, and it definitely has no arc.  The buildings don't really make any sense and there isn't as much sense of having constructed something as there is in Agricola or Ora Et Labora.   I want a sense of achievement and this game doesn't have it.   It's more about eeking out half a point here or half a point there.

RATING: 7
Enjoyable game - 4 rounds of three to five moves each. Each round you select five cards, and if any of your opponents play the same card (roughly), you both get to do a half-action. So ideally you'll get 3 full actions, 2 half actions. Reminded me in terms of the limited moves and plethora of good choices of Edo. On top of that, there is a clever mechanism where resources are on two wheels. If all the resources are 1 or higher on the wheel... the wheel turns back to 0 and you get a premium resource worth VPs at the end (and required to get better buildings). Finally, you have a board to build on - but the spaces you build over can be exploited for VPs and resources - if you get the buildings for it, and can afford them.

I'll be honest, this game hurts my brain every time I play it. Trying to focus on so many things, and visualising the sequence of which card to play first or what resource to get next prove to be an exercise that my brain can't handle.

With my recent play, I learnt to let go some things and focus on developing a certain formula, and that prove to work.

RATING: 9
Glass Road is Uwe Rosenberg's latest resource conversion game. Le Havre led to Ora and Labora led to The Glass Road. If you enjoyed those games, particularly O&L, you will enjoy this. 

It is shorter than either of it's forefathers, playing in a realistically achievable 20 mins per person. There are just 4 rounds and between 3 and 8 actions are played per round. You are building buildings which do 'stuff' and give VPs. It has a neat card mechanism whereby you select 5 action cards from a 15 card action deck which you all have identical copies of. You play 3 of these cards in a round. Each card has 2 actions. But when you play a card, if anyone else has it in their hand, then you can only use one of the actions, and the other player gets to use the card 'for free' too. So you are not only trying to select the cards with actions you want to use, you also need to be mindful of what others are playing as you want to play cards yourself which they don't have, so you can get to use both actions. Meanwhile you want to hold in your hand cards other players will use so you can get 'free' actions whilst also halving your opponent's use of the actions on their card. 

So...lot's to think about and a lot of the time is spent determining just which 5 cards you will take in to the round with you. Oh, and it has a really clever resource wheel which is a thing of great wonder.

After 1 play: My wife and I played one two player game and we both liked it. The game was pretty quick to teach and learn, nothing too complicated with the buildings that come up and the rules come with a comprehensive building list with directions.

Glass Road is a different game from the big box games like Agricola or Le Havre. But I came away thinking it borrowed a bit from them and threw in some Bohnanza style player interaction. While there's no trading, you really need to pay attention to what other players might be planning on to take advantage of their cardplay. The 2 player game plays quite different than the 3 or 4 player game, which seem to be the better player count. But even the two player game offers a lot of opportunity to take advantage of each other.

Purchased for $65-25 discount, this game seems like a game well worth that price. Nice components, interesting decisions throughout all phases of the game, a good rulebook and that nice Lohausen art.

After 5 plays: Many of my games have been solo, this category is still pending. But good solo game!

Love, love, love this game.  For me it's just the right amount of depth--it's a "light" game for Uwe Rosenberg, but mid-weight more generally. Although it's a bit of a "brain burner," it's a short game and really doesn't take much more than an hour to play, if all players are familiar with the game (and aren't too prone to AP).  

I think of it in the same category as Puerto Rico--the mechanics are quite different, but the games are similar in time, depth, ratio of skill to luck, and interactivity among the players.  

I absolutely love the resource wheel--it's a fun mechanic that always makes my head hurt a little bit--and it is unique among the games I've played.  There isn't a good one or two sentence way to explain it--but in sum:  when you generate one resource, you *may or may not* lose other resources.  But which resources you lose (and how many of each resource) depends on the location of the resources in relation to the dial and to each other. 

Glass Road also seems a lot more forgiving than say, Agricola.  An early mistake may set you back, but not insurmountably (and end game mistake though is another matter).

One of my favorite games from Rosenburg. The action selection mechanic works so well and is very interactive without causing any "take that" moments. 

The playtime is short enough to create a tight game where you wish you had just one more round to squeeze out as many points from your engine as possible. To some that's a negative, for me that's a huge positive.

2014-05-17 : Mechanically sound, but slightly boring as there's nothing new in the mechanics and there's no player interaction to speak of. Combined with the rather high luck factor of what buildings will come up and what characters other players will pick, you can't go into the game with an overall strategic plan - you just have to wing it play by play.

Great game but not very thematic, just feels like we are playing our own game and shifting tiles and our resource dials around, then it's game over.

Prefer more games where I don't have to try to focus on numbers and analyzing as I'm not really into making sure I take the perfect and precise turns to maximize my score to ensure victory and prefer more of a relaxing game and the surprise in the end of what I scored rather than studying while playing.

Glass Road is an interesting role selection resource management game.  I liked that this one comes with a large number of buildings that you only use a potion of each game.  I like the resource wheel, because it reminds me a bit of Ora & Labora, but works in a diffent mind-bending sort-of-way.  The role selection guessing game also seemed appealing/reminiscent of Race for the Galaxy.  The quick play time was also something that really appealed to me.  In the end, scoring is a little too tight and there are other euros/fast games I'd prefer to play.

The resource generation aspect seemed like a gimmick at first, but ended up being kind of brilliant. Also, the action selection mechanism was a bit of a brain burner, but in a good way, and led to a nice depth of strategy as you try to guess what actions your opponents will select and which actions you need.

A real brain teaser. The production wheels are a great design. Works well with all player counts. I really like that it's not a light game, but still plays like one with a small amount of pieces.

I agree with Tom Vasel, that building doesn't provide such satisfaction as in games like Caverna, but I'd still prefer this one because it plays so quick and still scratches your head hard.

Updated to 10, since this game is perfect in my opinion.

It is certainly a fast version of La Havre or Ora Labora, but what it gains in speed, it loses in an sense of control over how you play the game. You only see a very limited number of buildings and you have to basically build whichever is the best at the time feel. It also suffers from becoming a guessing game trying to figure out what your opponents are doing and think your doing so you can match theirs and not let them match you. Each time they match you lose half an action, and each time you match them, you gain half an action. In a 12 action game, this can be very swingy.

First impression was thinking that I wouldn't like it. "Typical eurogame of get resources and then VPs blah blah blah." But it turns out to be quite interesting after all. The key is the role selection where it's about managing between choosing unique roles (maximising your actions for that role and denying other players a chance to play extra cards) and choosing roles that other players have chosen (so you can get extra actions). Not sure about replayability with the same players because groupthink and figuring out a player's pattern will make the game less challenging. But for now, pleasantly surprised and enjoying the game.

[1 play] I'm not sure what I think about Glass Road, but it deserves another chance. I learned it under somewhat inauspicious circumstances: at a con, from people who were enthusiastic but had just recently learned the game themselves. Not a recipe for the best teaching. I was encouraged to not worry about the big picture but rather to just try to grasp the game as it unfolded. That worked OK for the logistics of what to do moment to moment, but at the end of the game I felt like I still didn't understand what I wanted to. I think this problem would not have existed with more thoughtful and coherent teaching. The jury is out on this till I have a chance to play it again. Speaking of historical info, though, I did not know any of the history this game is based in, and I thought it was fascinating. I should also note that this was pitched to me on the basis of the Witch's Brew-esque mechanic, which I thought was interestingly done.

I generally don't care for the designer's games, but Glass Road is actually quite pleasant, like a heavier Suburbia (building on your own board using public tiles) with a simultaneous role/action selection mechanism. Unfortunately, the prediction element of role selection is much muted here (each player chooses five cards from a set of fifteen each round, with several cards having very similar functionality), lacking the tension of something like Race for the Galaxy or Glory to Rome.

I found this one uninspiring to say the least. It was so bounded by limits that you could only do a little of this and a little of that such that it felt bland. The card play is reasonably interesting, but it needs to lead to a more satisfying conclusion. The game ends on turn 4 but could end a turn sooner or later with no significant difference in how your play pays off or not. Perhaps he had to nerf the scoring opportunities in order to encourage people to buy new sources (buildings) of VPs and not sit on what they have?

This might be the Uwe Rosenberg game for me. 

Well...my initial impression might be true, if only because the game is so short. You don't really accomplish much unless you focus on a strategy early. I don't suggest ever upgrading your core structures and be sure to accumulate the max sand, glass and brick (9 points). Scoring over 20 seems to be a challenge, but if you do, you probably won the game.

Optimally you want to match 2 of your opponents cards and have several exclusive (double effect) cards plays. If you're lucky to do this twice in the 4 rounds, the advantages are telling.

Glad to have played it, but it replaces nothing in my collection.

Enjoyed this enough to play again immediately. Strongly advise beginners do begin with the beginners' tiles. Our first game used all the tiles, we both only managed 2 builds in the game! Second game with just the beginners tiles went much better, we built lots more and improved scores.

The wheel mechanism is brilliant, very clever and the Next Big Thing. But I also enjoyed the subtle inter-action of double-thinking your opponents' choices to glom more stuff from their plays and to de-glom them/get the double action bonus yourself. AND, I really liked the action of clearing forest both provide resources and roome to build, but removing ponds pits and groves did not need an action.

All together a sweet package, collect, convert, build to VPs all boiled down to a very tight quick game. So much potential for other designers to steal from.

I predict, Kennerspiel 2014.

[b]Short playtime resource-conversion game in which players can piggyback extra actions if they guess what others' plans are. Too short to be fulfilling, I'd rather play something either more or less complex. After 4 plays, I don't need to play this ever again.

I'd rather play:
- Ora et Labora/Le Havre for more complex conversion.
- Broom Service for the borrowing actions.

Played with 2p/3p. Rating history: 8864[/b]

January 2016: With my 3rd play a few months ago, and my 4th play yesterday, I can say that the game made more sense to me, but that it just suffers in comparison to other games it reminds me of. Certainly not a bad game, but no spark in it to bring me back.

June 2014: The art turns me off a little bit, as it lacks the character I expect from Uwe Rosenberg games, but the gameplay was nice. You blind choose actions, hoping to piggyback for efficiency (not quite like any other game I've played),. The land-clearing, building, and (occassional) resource flipping is vaguely like Ora et Labora. The multiple paths to victory (largely through building is pure Rosenberg. A good light-middleweight with a short playtime. Yet still feels aimed at gamers to me: the blah artwork, and complex rondel management won't allow this to play well as a family game, I think. I suspect my rating will fall to a 7 after about 8 plays, but I hope I'm wrong.

Some similarities to Ora et Labora, but not the rondel (which is used entirely differently). The similarities are in removing terrain for resources, adjacent tile placement effects, and resource conversion.

Loved the mechanics for using & pricing resources.  3 short rounds & the game is over.  It reminds me a smidge of Eminent Domain where a player plays a card that others can also do if the card is in their hand, resulting in extra actions.

Pithy resource-conversion engine-building game with simultaneous role-selection that adds some more direct interaction.

I like this game in a very similar way that I do Homesteaders: within the resource-management/engine-building genre it's simple and the features it adds really improve the gameplay.

RATING: 8.5
A very elegant design of a game, especially compared to Uwe Rosenbergs more current designs. The rules of the game are very simple and it very easy to teach. Yet playing the game well can be pretty challenging.

I love the complexity to weight ratio of this game. I like the small footprint it has on the table and the minimal amount of components. Topo notch design.

RATING: 9
Glass Road plays like a lighter, shorter version of Le Havre or Ora et Labora but with almost all of the fun and more randomness.  It includes a significant bluffing element that can affect how productive each turn is, depending on how accurately I can predict the actions my opponents will take.  This is a plus for me but will no doubt be a minus for many people. I love the increased interaction. There are a ton of different buildings (usually only 12 of which will be available to buy at any given time), and combined with the fifteen available roles each player has, this game has a ton of replayability. Even though this game has a decidedly lighter feel than its predecessors, people prone to analysis paralysis may struggle over the multitude of options available at any given time.  I was pleasantly surprised. This makes my list of the top 5 2013 games so far.

Ezt sikerült nekem is kipróbálnom. Nagyon érdekelt a witch's brew-ra emlékeztető akcióválasztás miatt, de végül nem tetszett annyira. Nem mondom, nem is rossz, de valahogy nem annyira állt nekem össze az egész. Termésszetesen nem a szabályra gondolok itt, hanem inkább arra, hogy maguk az akciók, és az épületekkombinációk komoly agyalásra kényszerítenének, de közben ott van az akcióválasztás mechanizmusa miatt egy olyan randomfaktor, ami kicsit értelmezhetetlenné teszi a játékot. Akár jól is elsülhetett volna ez a hibrid, de nekem inkább torzszülött lett. Nem szívesen tervezgetek 5-10 perceket, ha utána van egy nagyon nehezen tolerálható véletlen, ami eléggé megváltoztatja a helyzetet.

Mentségére legyen mondva, hogy nagyon rövid, így alapból a randomitás nem zavaró, csak a többi mechanizmus mellett fura.

Két játékot toltunk 3, 4 fővel is teljesen jól működött.

I'm growing a little weary of games that ask players to parse a gazillion different choices up front in order to even start the game. Ora et Labora is a prime candidate here. The Glass Road could be described as a hybrid of OeL and Witch's Brew. As such it does have this problem as well to some extent but the buildings are all fairly simple in nature with limited interaction which tones down the issue significantly.

The game's focus is also clearly on trying to predict what actions the other players will choose and participating in those. Again, the implications aren't quite as strong and as pure as in Witch's Brew but what the game sacrifices at one end it gains at the other. Glass Road straddles a comfortable middle ground between those two titles.

Another great, fast, super brain burn-y game. Somehow, every round, I pick my cards with a solid plan in mind and then it all devolves into "wait, why the hell did I pick this guy? I don't need him".

Great game where youhave to manage your ressources to build new buildings and generate points. I like the selection mechanic for your cards which is quite similiar to 'Wie verhext'. Finding good combinations between several buildings is always fun. The great number of different buildings guarantees a good replay value.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Yet another game from Uwe Rosenberg in which you are supposed to turn resources into buildings which might give you other resources or points; in this case a relatively light game. The unique element in this one is the way you select your actions: you pick five roles to play at the start of a round, and then get to play 3-5 of them during the game, depending on what roles the others pick. There is quite a lot of luck involved, as you early on have to decide where to get your points from, but you cannot know whether the buildings that will come out mesh with your plan. Since the end scores will be quite close anyway, this particular factor has a big influence. It is not a bad game, but totally forgettable. Skip it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The best part of this game is the unique feel of the very euro mechanics. I feel the game is over right before the critical moment of getting everything properly lined up for a good scoring engine. As with a number of euro games, this seems both intentional, and a fault of my play style of trying to set so much up at once. 

The them is very lightly applied to the mechanics of this game, but there are some very interesting mechanics and interaction concepts going on. It is not a game I understood how to play just by explanation. I will need more plays to understand how to score better.

Also, the symbology made my brain weep trying to convert them into mental pictures of how useful each building would be for me.

I really love this game. The game really improves a lot on the endless piles of resources found in Ora & Labora by using wheels. Your producing brick on one wheel and glass on the other. 

I really like the synergy of how purchasing certain tiles let you manipulate the wheels resources to help you purchase other high value tiles. 

I like all of the Uwe Rosenberg games. You can play it 1 - 4 players and my first game was a solo play. I might have cheated a little but I really had fun just seeing what would happen if I did this or that or this. Wow! That's something else! 

I have read where the "Roofing Company" tile can break the game by setting up some kind of infinite loop to victory, although I've not seen it myself. But I still love this game.

On the light side of the Uwe Rosenberg games, but easily one of my favourites at this time. The gameplay is easy enough to understand and explain, but there are incredible amounts of interesting decisions to make at every point along the way.

The cards seem to be the hardest part to explain, due to the 'I get to play my card for free because of what you played' mechanic, however it's easily the most interesting part of the game for me, as it introduces an aspect of mind-gameyness to an otherwise dry Euro.

Dry conversion game of resources to points, with a little guessing game off to the side, where you hope to predict what opponents will play to slow them down and add to your actions or resources.

The cardplay is great and is my favorite part of this game. The draw of buildings is tough and there quite frankly be nothing of interest to you since your plays are relatively few in this game.

I guess it is a different take on gathering, spending or upgrading resources but is it really any better than other games?

My best solo game! As a two player game not the best Uwe game for me... It´s to much on getting points for the endgame... This game gives me the feeling like i´m at the beginning of the game already busy with the end of the game..
Yes, almost every game is about who is winning.... But most of the Uwe games you have the feeling you are building stuff, and as a side effect you are scoring points with it... 
In this game it is less covered...

Is it then nog a good game? No! It is a great game, a lot shorter then the other Uwe games and with very interesting techniques that are very different from the other Uwe games....
And the best solo game! 

Great!!

It has a lot of good ideas that I really like. I like the card idea, I love simultaneous selection in general and the way it's handled in this game is very well done. I love that you are rewarded heavily if you can guess other players' choices and the timing of each card played is important. It adds so much tension and interaction to an otherwise dry euro. The second idea I really like is the resource wheels. They are a clear and helpful, though not quite intuitive, way to track the resources and their conversion, which of course is the main focus of the game. The building system is fine, though most buildings don't seem that interesting at first and clearing your land works well, but it's nothing to write home about. The game is quick and it almost feels like it ends too suddenly, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Overall, a very solid game!

This feels like what I imagine the cave half of Caverna to be, so Caverna must be half Glass Road, half Agricola.  :P  

Glass Road plays quick! Wow.  Some good thinking involved, but so far I've had difficulty squeezing out a victory.  Every game is decided by 0.5 or 1 point.

UPDATE after 3 plays: Okay, I've finished learning the game and identified the few rules missteps we made, but none of them affected how well the game plays.  I dig it.  Nice, fast, thinky... reminds me of Glen More in some ways where buildings and resources chain react.

UPDATE: If you don't buy any production buildings, the game is a very literal affair.  You need clay? You play a card that gets you clay.  I almost traded this game away because of this.  After reviewing the designer's advice in the rulebook to ignore end game score tiles for the first two rounds and only focus on production buildings, we decided to give it another try.  It's a lot more fun being able to convert resources and manipulate your dials on your own in order to get the right combination of resources to afford to build something.  That was a satisfying play.  Satisfying enough that we're interested in playing more, so I've removed it from "For Trade"

UPDATE: after 8 plays I realized we were playing wrong.  Rules for 2p on page 10.  In a 2p game you play more than 3 card rounds.  You play until one player runs out of cards.  Oy.  9th play was so much better.  Feels like the belt was loosened a couple notches. 

UPDATE: 11th play.  Game is great.  Compact, small footprint, but so rich and deep with hard decisions.  We've reached the point where the game is as much about copycatting the opponent's card as it is about figuring out good scoring combos.  Love this game.  My wife picks it all the time.

This game is cute and lovely. It's a very simple resource management/conversion game driven by simultaneous role selection in the form of cards. What I love so much about Glass Road is it's short-length, it's interactive mechanisms, and the fact that despite being on the lighter end of Uwe's spectrum, it manages to capture all the tense moments and interesting decisions of a full-length Uwe. The art and theme are also absolutely charming.

The twist how ressources can interact on that clockwheel ist interesting. The cardplay mechanism however is not. You have at least 3 cards to play and if you're lucky even 5. People how can profit that way have an advantage but it's pretty imponderable if you get those bonus actions by outguessing your fellow players. If a player gets during the game five cards more in play than you he surely will make more victory points than you. Not very motivating. It's more about calculating than having fun. Not bad but not convincing either.

A little tricky to learn on the first play. One of those games where it took me a round or two to get comfortable, and by then it was too late to win. 

I liked the tension it creates by never giving your quite enough actions for everything you need to do. I wasn't surprised to learn that it was the same guy who designed Agricola.

I wasn't wild about the wheel mechanic for resource management. It felt a little gimmicky and not as intuitive as it could have been.

Just another game about getting resources and building buildings that give you options or points. It's the same old game, the only different thing is that the ressources increase/decrease automatically, depending on what you do.

Did I mention that there's no interaction and that you just gather resources to build buildings to generate points? -.-

Interesting resource-tracking mechanic. Feels a bit like Argicola given the management of your forest-lands and resource-trading for buildings. I liked the role selection mechanic and ability to piggy-back off of roles chosen by others. Seems largely driven by the ability to get buildings that will act in combination, which means building up a private stock of buildings early on. I would favor Le Havre over this, but this over Agricola.

It looks, feels and plays a lot like Agricola

That said it does have some VERY clever mechanics which Agricola doesn't have such as the way that the rondels manage your resources and you effectively have to turn one of each of the resources in to make glass/brick - that's a neat little idea

Plus the card mechanics are really nice with choosing a hand of 5 and then the way they play out. I like that a lot.

Unfortunately though all the same criticisms I lay at Agricola are still valid. There is too much choice, too many things going on and trying to figure out a strategy in amongst it all is just a bit crazy (unless of course you have an encyclopedic knowledge of the deck and a lot of luck.

I'm upgrading this to a 7. It's definitely Uwe Rosenburgs best game and I should have given it more than the 5.5 I did before. The rondels and the card choices are both very good

RATING: 7
Yet another recent Euro that leaves you feeling overwhelmed first time you play it. It's based on a clever central mechanism, the 'sweeper arm' that tells you how many resources you have, but the consequences of it moving are hard to forsee. You play cards for action choices, but you may be forced to play them out of sequence if others match your hand. This is a rarity in gaming land, a heavy game with a substantial chaos factor and like the poster child of this genre, Tigris and Euphrates, it won't be everyone's cup of tea.

This game seems designed to frustrate those who have optimized other Rosenberg harvest-style games, and it does that by forcing players to play their cards out of order.

A great game with a unique resource mechanic, and while it is prone to some serious AP, gives interesting decisions at every possible point.

The resource generation mechanic is the main attraction here, and is what separates it from the ocean of similar resource management games.  You have two clock faces, each has hands that keep the basic and premium resources separate, and these spin throughout the game to increase or decrease your stocks.  You are always trying to manipulate your supplies in such a way as to keep the clock spinning at a steady rate to ensure constant production of the premium goods which will ultimately score you points.  What I love about this mechanic is that it doesn't necessarily reward somebody who is adept at generating huge amounts of 1 or 2 resources - I have seen a few games before in which you only really need a large stock of money, for example, which can then be traded to skip certain phases of production.  That is not so in this game - you must be producing steady amounts of all the resources to win the game.

The other big part of the game is the action selection round in which you are picking cards one at a time, the other cards in your hand can be played on top of the one selected if somebody else picked any of them for their turn.  This creates a great sub-game in which you are also trying to outguess and second-guess your opponent's moves to maximise the actions you can take on your turn.  This is critical to the game as there are only 4 rounds.

These two great mechanics come together to make a straightforward but very brainburner-y game.

Essentially Agricola without the worker placement, Glass Road manages to be an excellent game anyway. While it will never replace Agricola for hardcore gamers, it does offer a couple of advantages:

1) There are no negative points (from not feeding your people, not having certain resources at game end, not filling in all available spaces), making this one "seem" a lot more forgiving.

2) Everyone starts with the same options (there is no risk of one player having just the right set of cards for a power build), making the game more fair.

The role selection works well as a mechanic, and there is just as much player interaction as Agricola. The game is also beautiful and the resource wheels are great. This one's a real winner!

Mecánica curiosa la elegida por Uwe para uno de sus últimos juegos.

Se trata, como no, de gestionar recursos. La gracia reside en que cada jugador tiene un set de cartas que va usando para realizar las acciones disponibles. Si es el único en elegir esa acción tiene un bono.

Además la gestión de los recursos se hace con una especie de ruleta en la que hay productos simples y elaborados. A medida que aumentas los productos simples, "fabricas" productos elaborados, que inmediatamente hace que disminuya tu cantidad de productos simples. Es una mecánica curiosa.

Soulless 'game'.

Nothing new, just a sloppy pile of well worn out mechanisms, put without any attention one onto another.

Throw in some resources, some characters and buildings to process them in any way possible and some buildings to score VPs.  The rest is up to the players.  There you got a game...
No - this is not the way to go, Mr Rosenberg.

This is a generic draft of some game, not the actual game.

Take what would be an otherwise strategic contract filling game, and add some PIC and randomness to it and you have GR. Even though it’s a 30 - 45 minute game, its random nonsense in a very annoying fashion, much much worse than Loyang ever was, his worse game for me by far. I could plan my whole turn around getting one building, and be screwed over in SEVERAL different ways; by being forced to play a card too soon, my resource wheel shifts because of what someone else does, someone shares in my action, someone actually builds the building first, etc.  Whats the bluddy point for Pete’s sake?? Rubbish!! Oh sure, I can settle for sloppy seconds right, ah yeah thanks. 

While the wheel is a nifty little device that works well, it also makes calculating a PITA for this random little 40 min game.  And yes while there was an attempt at theme its really just another soulless spreadsheet exercise.  The ONLY [i]almost[/i] redeeming quality was you got to pick which 5 cards out of the 13 or so total you would attempt to play on a turn, but I already pointing to just how those carpets can be pulled from under you, ha ha ha, boy that was fun, not

Truly terrible, and worse than Felds awful Bruges and I would normally be pretty forgiving of some of this like one or two things in a 30 minute game but it really went too far here imo and I played the 2 player, good grief, imagine this nonsense playing with more, HAH! I’m so done with this kind of crap, give me a random FUN 30 minute party game or give me a 30 minute meaty filler but for Pete's sake don’t mix the two.

A Rosenberg resource-conversion game. Replaces the worker-placement action-sharking stress of Agricola/Le Havre and the building-sharking stress of Ora with simultaneous selection. It's... a very different skill, and a very different game. Probably lighter-weight but I'm not certain of that. It's also much faster than the other three, which is nice.

Beat the "excellent" score of 30 for a solo game on my first play. Kind of disappointing. The second play was 29.5, so still really close to what is supposed to be excellent gameplay twice in a row on first plays. The solo is interesting and sort of sandboxy and has a simple method of frustrating your play by requiring you to play your cards in a random order.
-Third and Fourth plays were 26 and 35 points respectively. The 35 point game had really nice building symmetry.
-After a total of 7 plays I am less bothered that I can consistently score around 30 and am more intrigued by how I can salvage a poor starting offer or simply play to see if I can beat my best score without caring what the game says "excellent" should be.

Current high score: 39.5

RATING: 5.5
The resource wheel mechanic is interesting, but you get so few actions in the game that you never really feel like you get going. You pick one or two nice point scoring buildings, make sure to just barely be able to buy them, and hope for the best. Maybe it threw me off since it looks like it's going to be an engine builder but it's not, it's over too fast to be one. One of my friends went too heavily into the resource conversion buildings, and so by the end he could get basically any resources, but it didn't matter since he never got any big point buildings and he got crushed.

RATING: 7
this is a nice 1hr medium weight game with a couple of unique(?) mechanics (the production wheels and the way the that the cards are played).

I really like the cards, but the production wheels are a gimmick that adds an unnecessary headache to your plans (the card system only really works at its finest with 4players).

The biggest problem that this game has is the randomness of the building tiles:

1) you can spend the early game accumulating lots of resources in hope that a building will come out that makes great use of them

and/or

2) you can buy vp buildings early and work towards making them work, and hope that any buildings that come out later synergize with what you've already done.

either way, unless you manage to snag a combo early in the game, it's just down to luck as to what you buy works with what you're doing or not.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (March 2014)

I heavily dislike Witch's Brew so when a friend was explaining this to me, I actually thought this was going to be a bad game, however there is not a single Rosenberg game I dislike and this was no exception. I DO like Glass Road a lot (in fact I bought it today).

The game has simple rules, but it also has meaty decisions in a very short time frame (basically which cards to play, the buildings are a lot more obvious). LOVE the resource wheel, I haven’t played Ora et Labora so I’m not sure if the resources are managed in the same way, but I think this is a brilliant design making it very easy to see how many resources you have AND you have a very low upkeep to do in that regard. 

Perhaps Glass Road has more randomness that it is usual in an Rosenberg game, but I need to explore it further to see if this is a negative, neutral or positive thing for me. My guess is that it is a positive thing as the game is so short but it can be negative when big VP buildings appear and you are last in turn.

I dislike that you have to take away a building that allows you to get an infinite loop (this also happened with Caverna), makes me wonder if these games are not thoroughly tested before release. 

Bottom line, it is Witch's Brew done correctly. For now I like it a lot but that can change if I feel the randomness in the buildings is too high. Good euro game. 

Current Rating: 7.0

After more plays, I continue to love Glass Road. A friend asked how could I love this game and hate Witch's Brew. The answer is that in Glass Road you can still play even if another player chose the same role as you, in Witch's Brew you are screwed if another player chose the same role as you and you are first in the turn order. Also the decisions are much more deeper in Glass Road, I don’t think a player can chose roles randomly and do well (I have seen this in Witch's Brew).

The resource wheel is very interesting. It can mislead you easily when you make Glass or Brick as you can easily forget that you spend every other resource you have doing this. I have seen people lose due to this and I really like it, it adds a subtle layer of complexity.

Really good, plays super fast, and the things I was worried about turned out to be non-issues and a really super fun, fast and deep game. Liam enjoyed playing it a lot as well. The resource wheels are brilliant and clever, but ooh so easy to misplay a card because of.

[b]Thoughts after tenth play[/b] [BGCOLOR=#9999ff] [b]6[/b] [/BGCOLOR]
After around 7 plays I realized that while this is a well designed and interesting to play game, it's also just OK. I like the game, but when I compare it to other games I really like playing (Caverna and Terra Mystica) it's just too short, and punishing. It feels [b]REALLY[/b] bad when another player steals a building you spent a couple rounds building towards, completely hosing your plans for the round.

During the last three plays, I kept thinking about Race for the Galaxy and San Juan, and how I'd rather be playing those.

I've lowered my rating to a 6, and I plan on trading/selling Glass Road.

Our first Uwe Rosenburg game. Sort of. We have Bohnanza. I've played Agricola and Le Havre, and my wife has played a lot of Le Havre, but we don't own either game. I guess this is just the first medium/heavy Rosenburg we've purchased. This is a really good game. It's very thinky, more strategic than tactical. You have to be thinking about what your opponents are doing in order to maximize your opportunities. And you really have to think about what buildings are available and how to best use them to get points, which are at a premium.

Wonderful with 2 players.  Plays very quickly and has lots of tough choices!  The components are nice and PLENTIFUL (it took nearly an hour to punch out all the buildings, assemble the resource wheels, and put on the stickers).

Very interesting how important it is to choose your 5 cards according to what you think your opponents will pick.  I imagine this aspect is brought to the forefront in 3 and 4 players games, and I look forward to trying it out at that player count.

The solo game is really amazing here - just a great game all around!

It is very different from Uwe's other games - its not a worker placement game and you are not feeding any animals.  In this engine building game, with the main mechanic being simultaneous actions selection; wise selections allow you piggy-back on other players' selections.   Players collect resources to purchase buildings that will help them accumulate more resources or add to their final score.  Lots of strategy and lots of competition to acquire the best buildings available before the other players.  Lots of strategic goodness in about one hour.

This is an enjoyable resource gathering and conversion game. I like the way goods are tracked on the wheels and those also serve to make bricks and glass which are important for buying buildings. The game seems to play very fast. There is a chaotic element in that if other players have in hand a card you played, you and they get half the actions on the cards. It is also a way to get more actions since you only play 3 of 5 cards, but two more can be played from matching.  It is good and bad. It adds some strategy in thinking about what cards the other players may select, but you could get unlucky in your selection. This randomness keeps it from being a great game for my taste, but it goes fast enough that I wouldn't mind an occassional play.

Overwhelming at first; with a mitt full of cards and a board full of buildings, it can be hard to figure out where to even begin. Things fall into place by about the end of round two and it begins to make sense... 

Love the mechanic of 'sharing' actions by having the same cards in your hand as your opponent is playing; although the knife cuts both ways, and it stings when you lose out on what you thought was going to be a double action due to someone playing the card earlier in the round than you had planned.

One of the greatest achievements of Glass Road is its flexibility with different player counts. Have now played solo, 2 players, and 4 players - and each one plays slightly differently, giving each version its own distinct flavour.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
[gameid=34084] blown up to a full Rosenberg game. Each of the 4 rounds each player chooses 5 out of 15 action cards. Each round three of them get played consecutively with each player again simultaneously choosing one. If one of the hand cards got chosen as action by another player, the action is followed and both players get only one of two possible effects. A very solid and fun mechanism worth more than one boardgame implementation.
It weren't Uwe Rosenberg if he didn't add 6 or 7 different resources, resource conversion and purchase of buildings. The breaking idea is the introduction of the two production wheels for glass and bricks. Sometimes, it's better not to produce the one missing basic resource to get another of the two advanced resources because it will cost another basic resource badly needed.
The random factor is higher than in other big box Rosenberg's and the AP risk in card selection is high as well. Considering the close scores, randomness might be bothering with repeated play but for now I want to play more.

Not understanding the love for this game. The resource management wheel is really cool, but it feels really unfulfilling to play out in my opinion. I've only played twice... won both times... and yet I didn't feel overly awesome doing so. Becomes a game about tiny optimizations that don't feel all that clever. 

Maybe a better game if you really dig deep and play a lot with some high-level strategy players. Honestly feel it's a 6.5 but giving some benefit to the doubt because I was able to combo off once and maybe there is something bigger there if you can repeat doing so.

Complexity is somewhere between Agricola: ACB&S and Agricola. But I really do love the card mechanic of the game.

RATING: 6
The game is clearly in predicting the actions other players are going to lead with. Both for personal gain when leeching their actions, and to harm the others by weakening their action cards. And under some circumstances a game about that can be fascinating, Race for the Galaxy is the most obvious example. I think my problem with Glass Road is that the prediction task is made harder but not more interesting by introducing a much more complicated economic system.

I can see this game working well once people have learned the cards and the buildings and are able to play very fast. The single play we had of this was close to 2h though, which is way too much. Don't know if there's any chance of me ever playing with a group where everyone has built up that experience.

This is a little too puzzly for me. The wheel is a cool mechanism, definitely more than a gimmick. And the theme is unusual enough to almost be interesting. But the large number of unknown tiles that come out make the game a little too difficult to grasp during initial plays, which definitely hurt the game's staying power. Merkator had the same problem. These bonuses are obviously central to achieving a good score, but not knowing what could potentially come out IMO hurts the game. If it happens in the beginning (like in Agricola), that's one thing, but if it happens as the game progresses, I like it less.

Splendid fun. Best experience I have had with Uwe's resource twisters. The leeching feature is super fun outguessing and plan screwing experiment. It's great that you have to come up with a combination of cards you want to play and some that you want to use for leeching and screwing. And then you have to come up with a plan B. And even if you are screwed you're not totally screwed, but still get to do some stuff. I also like the resource rondels a lot. Components are of neat quality with some nice details included. Major con might be AP caused by choosing the cards for the round -> use timer.

While I enjoy the buildings, the card selection, the resource wheels, the land management, and the length for a rather heavy game, this one misses the mark. Mainly, it is because I feel like everything in this game is a long walk for a short drink of water. Lots of thinking and planning, lots of small step, just to get a building that can be half, or a third, of a combo you want to get. Less than the sum of its part for me.

A few things I really like about this one: 
1) It is a faster Euro game that retains much of the Rosenberg feel.  With four players we finished our first game in 1 1/2 hours and this included an AP prone player.
2) There is a lot of variety given the buildings and how the cards play out.
3) Resource management is an interesting twist from other games.
4) Related to the former, this game is unique and adds variety to my collection.  

Things that don't bother me but are worth being aware of:
1) New players can feel directionless and confused by the new game mechanics, especially in how they relate to the goal of the game.
2) It can be harder to find satisfaction in the development of your board compared to games like Agricola, Ora & Labora, and Le Havre.  The beginning board and end board look similar at first glance.

Suggestions: Give it a couple of plays.  The wheel will take a game to figure out and maybe even another to feel comfortable with. New players also need to know that the goal is to get the resources needed to build buildings!  It may seem obvious, but be sure to let everyone know this.  Otherwise the wheel and card selection will feel exceedingly random.

I’ve decided that I don't like this game.  This is a game that could be great but ends up being just okay and is one that I really don't care if I play it again.  It has great resource wheels and interesting game play from the standpoint of deciding what cards to choose and when to play them.  I like the way the cards work.  Also, it’s a relatively short game which is a plus.  But there are two reasons why I’ve been turned off by this game.  First, although I like the mechanism of playing the cards and taking the actions (either one or two), trying to manage your resource choices ends up involving a good deal of guessing.  The process is stressful (for lack of a better term) and not in an enjoyable or rewarding way.  I usually end up guessing and hoping for the best.  Second, the game design suffers from a trait not uncommon with some other Rosenberg games (Le Havre, Ora et Labora) and that’s the extreme difficulty in being able to read each of the different building tiles from across the table and at different angles.  Although this wouldn’t be much of a problem in a solo or two-player game, with more players it’s quite frustrating.  I usually end up ignoring the public buildings for the most part and just playing the Feudal Lord a lot and managing my own private buildings.  I’ve found that I don’t enjoy playing this game that much (unlike both Le Havre and Ora et Labora) and usually feel glad when it’s over.  I don't need to play this game again.

Quickest Rosenberg boardgame (only 20 minutes per player). Really solid overall.

Played it more now. Card selection is the core feature and it makes great fun to choose the right amount of overlapping and unique cards. But there's more to Glass Road than just chosing the right cards. Chosing the right buildings and making the decision to follow the strategy of an opponent or to differentiate your resource focus is a very important secondary level behind pure card selection.

Plays really fast for an Uwe game. I've only played 2 and 3 player games and I'm sure the 4 player version will be even more fun with multiple people playing the same roles. Unlike Agricola or Caverna, this is a highly tactical game. You can't depend on your plan before the round to come anywhere close to what happens so you have to adapt every single play. The huge number of buildings is a big plus. A good amount of euro in about the quickest game possible. Strategy is still lacking for me as I score terribly each game.

Uwe Rosenberg in minimalistic fashion. A good quick psychological euro game that rewards you for guessing what your opponents want to do and rewards you for executing a good solid strategy. The production wheel is in full swing here being both a boon and a bane (depending on your execution in using it.) The best aspect about this game is that it plays super quick while giving a full game experience. Have to applaud Uwe for making a game that has as many decisions in it as his other offerings at 30-50% of the time.

12-18-2013 - After 3 plays, I do indeed like this one.  At first I didn't, it seemed too random.  It's still pretty random, but the game just isn't about pure strategy, it's about being able to manipulate your situation into something positive regardless of what you get in a way that lacks in most other "completely random" games I've played.  If that makes sense.  A solid 8 for now.

The driving mechanic: role card selection is really amazing, because the interactions and planning are really cool. Otherwise the game is slightly bland and the access to buildings is slightly more luck dependent than I'd like. All in all still a great game.

RATING: N/A
"I'm growing a little weary of games that ask players to parse a gazillion different choices up front in order to even start the game. Ora et Labora is a prime candidate here. The Glass Road could be described as a hybrid of OeL and Witch's Brew. As such it does have this problem as well to some extent but the buildings are all fairly simple in nature with limited interaction which tones down the issue significantly.

The game's focus is also clearly on trying to predict what actions the other players will choose and participating in those. Again, the implications aren't quite as strong and as pure as in Witch's Brew but what the game sacrifices at one end it gains at the other. The Glass Road straddles a comfortable middle ground between those two titles."

RATING: 6
What I can say based on one haphazard play of trying to learn this, the double-guessing part with the cards seemed to get too chaotic every once in a while. RFTG does this thing so much better. Maybe when getting more familiar with the game, one can concentrate more on keeping an eye out for what others are going for and deduct their card plays to leech some more free actions. The resource management wheel, where the lesser stuff automatically converts into glass and bricks, was fresh and neatly done. You must be more careful with production and can't just score a big end of game bonus with some particular stuff.

First play comment: Even though it's harder to make plans here, I'd prefer playing this one over Caverna any time. Why? Because it's fun and interesting (two interesting mechanism ideas: one is the RftG/GtR-Witch'sBrew cardplay and the other one is the forced manufacturing. 

Uwe should return to simpler and/or cardgames and I'd love what he does. His Harvest series is... great, but I just get a bit bored of learning the same games again.

1/2014: starts at a 7: it seems like the Uwe Rosenberg magic condensed into 45 minutes, which is pretty impressive, but I'm concerned about whether or not the 'real' magic, e.g. the glorious sense of building something amazing, will survive. It will need a few plays.

Le Havre and Ora et Labora probably don't have to fear this one, but man... 45 minutes is an appealing length!

RATING: 7.5
On the upside: a Rosenberg that actually plays fast (like 1h).  The resource wheel thing is clever but a touch artificial, gamy & unwieldy.  On the downside: scores are often very close and wins are not particularly satisfying.  A decent game that didn't click with me as much as I'd hoped.

It plays out rather fast but the choices you've to make are very very difficult.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Short game that ends right when you feel you have your engine primed and ready to go.  Be careful collecting resources as the wheel moves and changes quantity of all resources if you leave the lowest spot empty...although that does improve your advanced good.  Feels overwhelming at first due to all the unique buildings.  Card play can be brutal as you must play a card if someone else did and that could occur in a different sequence than you desire as a result.

=====================================================

Kurt R put it so well in his perspective that I'll just quote him:

The game was so constrained a take on the euro as to be lifeless. To play on the "knife fight in a phone booth" analogy, it was a "spork fight in a school cafeteria" with ever present hall monitors to make sure nothing is getting out of hand. Young man, do you have more than 7 wood? Put 3 back! We never have more than 7 of anything here, young man! 

The way the resource rondel works limits you to 3 glass/brick or 7 basic goods, and when you go up in one, you go down in the others. So, I increase my food which then makes all my other stuff go down. And yeah, I get that in theory I'm increasing my glass or bricks but once you max out, you're just lowering your other stuff. You'll see.

I went a "pond strategy" and was able to get a lot of sand and water if I wanted to. Then I got a VP building for 1 VP per 2 water. I had 5 water and could get 5 more, but 7 is the limit, of which only 6 will score for 3 points. And thus ends the Great Pond Strategy. Go to hell.

On the last turn, my decisions were like this: get a VP building to give me 1 VP per 1 wood. Oh nice, I have 5 wood! But I have to give up 2 wood (WTF?) and something else I can't recall but I think maybe a glass which is also a VP. Oh, let me find something else then. I can give up 1 point for 1.5 points or I can take this building that kicks me in the nuts and calls my mom a whore. What to do, what to do... 

So while the card play is mildly interesting, the space for any kind of imaginative play has been bounded so rigidly as to suck the life out of it. It felt joyless. No, seriously, is this all there is? Between this and the re-implementation of Agricola, I seriously wonder if our boy Rosenberg has played his hand. Thanks, Uwe, it was a fun ride.

I went into this with trepidation: I don't like Agricola, Le Havre, or Ora et Labora. I don't like fiddly-assed microturns that consist of one of 32 steps needed to eventually get a donkey or an oven or whatever. Thankfully Glass Road isn't one of those games. On the contrary, it seems to be aimed exactly at people like me who don't like that stuff. Your actions can't be blocked, although they can be hampered some. There are a variety of ways to get the resources you need, and no resources that do nothing except take up spaces in a chain that eventually ends in something you want. The glass and brick production wheels are pretty clever, especially in the way they're double-edged (you'll want to avoid some resources because otherwise bricks or glass will get made and other resources will be used up.) Not my favorite game in the world, and I won't weep if I never play it again, but nor do I dread it being brought to the table, which is saying a lot when it comes to many eurogames these days.

So what we have here was an apparent rework of a mechanic from Witch's Brew that apparently is actually from an older game that Ewe created; go figure.

Many people have said there are few choices, but I actually disagree. Of course, those choices and your planning can be largely mitigated or accelerated by opponents' card play.

For some reason this game grabs me. Not in a huge way, but what I found interesting in Witch's and chose to leave behind is much better developed and diversified in this game.

Interesting game where you have the same set of cards as all other players.  You pick 5 to play and on your turn you reveal a card.  Any other player with same role can take the role too.  If no other player has played that role, you get to take both abilities for that role.  You play three roles, but can match two roles.  

You gather resources to build buildings and score points.  I found it an interesting variant on Ora Et Labora but with the interesting role mechanic.  

I like the game a lot although it can run long with AP prone players.

The card mechanism is also great, but it probably belongs in a lighter game, because it is incredibly difficult to predict, and swings quite a lot (at least relatively to the games scope and complexity). 

I have not played the 2-player game, and I suspect the card mechanism to be better there.

RATING: 9
Another quality design from Uwe Rosenberg. I really love the resource dial mechanic in this, and that's fortunate, since the bulk of the game revolves around figuring out how to get the most out of it.

This features some of the hallmarks of games such as Agricola and Le Havre... agonising decisions, having to rethink carefully laid plans when your options change. What's missing is the sense of building an efficiency engine (efficiency is a factor, and you do build things over the course of the game, but it's not quite the same). This comes through in the way the game ends after an arbitrary 4 rounds (which you can bump up to 5 if you want a longer game). Other Rosenberg games feel "done" when they end, whereas the ending to Glass Road feels more abrupt.

Nevertheless, this is great stuff. Play time is shorter than other Uwe Rosenberg games, and the game is a bit lighter (though still very thinky), which probably makes it a bit more accessible. It seems Uwe Rosenberg has finally figured out how to make a game loaded with resources and choices but without being fiddly and requiring significant set-up/pack-up time, and this is a big plus... I don't have as much spare time now as I did when his earlier games came out, but somehow have still managed to squeeze in quite a few plays.

RATING: 7.5
What a nice pick! this game has some brilliant ideas in it, the wheels give a very challenging experience even if the game itself is quite simple to play. Nice combos can be done with the interaction of the various buildings.
I know many people puzzle about this game, since it'd require too much endeavour for what it gives back but I  think they somehow miss the point; this game is not all about building and making your village bigger and bigger, it's about optimizing goods and creating combos and conversion engines. That's the most enjoyable part of the game, imho.

Choosing the cards for "roles" and being able to tag onto other players when they take their actions is interesting. Can be VERY ap prone during the card selection phase. You have to watch what other people are doing to improve your chances of selecting the right cards. If you don't choose well you might find that you could not play all of your cards because the round ends when someone has played all of his or her cards. This means that if you were unable to "tag along" you will be left with unplayed cards in most rounds. That can be frustrating at times for some people because you have to choose cards you might not really want but are certain will be played.

Apart from Agricola, I usually don't really like Uwe's games. And this one really doesn't excite me at all. Although the theme looked interesting, playing the game felt boring boring boring. And the theme? Was there a theme?

Ok the resource clocks are a new concept. But it doesn't bring any excitement to the game. And the buildings that you need to buy to score, don't inspire me at all.

The card mechanic reminded me of [thing=34084][/thing]. But there it is used in a fun way. 

Please don't let me play this one again. There are so much better resource transformation games out there. So why bother with this one?

A marriage of the role selection that I first encountered in Wie Verhext and nifty resource dials. The latter will, at first glance, just represent the automatic exchange of 5 (or 3) basic resources into the advanced resources glass (and bricks), but they turn out to be a bit more tricky in actual use, mostly because the automatic exchange is not something you’re keen on all of the time.

Even with just the basic cards, the two games we played exhibited the variety that will come from different building selections, so replayability should not be a problem here. Analysis Paralysis might become one, but at least our rounds went smoothly. Possibly due to lack of experience. All in all, this was a thoroughly pleasant surprise, especially given how fast it plays.

Bought at Berlin Con 2016. 
After 8 solo plays: Very quick, puzzly game, about building production chains on your tableau with spatial elements. Feels like a true Rosenberg with some variations.
Interesting resource management with a wheel that automatically transforms base resources into glass or brick, consuming the base resources at the same time. Selecting actions is done via 15 role cards (fisher, builder, etc) of which 5 are choosen each round. Depending whether other players selected the same action you get to do one or two actions provided by that role. This is a nice variation on Ora & Labora by the same author. 
In the solo and two player game action selection is very different but still engaging.

Decent lighter, shorter, more accessible game by Uwe Rosenberg. But it still is an Uwe at its core: collect A convert to B, score points via building C of something like that. A somewhat new resource wheel. Some fun puzzling. Quite solitary play to optimize your point scoring except for some mindreading while selecting cards to play. Not particularly a game for me, but I will play it once in a while, when others suggest it.

Well, at least this game did something right: It convinced me I've really become jaded at 'yet another eurogame that mechanically works well but where the theme is totally pasted on'. 

While the game works I became kinda got disinterested while playing it, although it was allright playing it. Which is a good thing. Because it saves me so much time (and money, and shelf space!) by not being interested in at least 400 of the 600 bland eurogames that come out every year. It saves me at least a month of free evenings because I can't even be bothered anymore with even reading the rules.

I guess this is the game that really stopped me from being interested in yet another Uwe game. Might have loved it if I hadn't already played a couple hundred different games. Was allright to play once. Won't ask for it again, and probably would suggest strongly to play something else. I gues I would only play it if everybody else would'nt want to play something else. You know the category if you're jaded like me: great game for autists that like to optimize their soloplay while vaguely thinking they're interacting with other souls out there at the same table doing the same thing because the piggybacking mechanisms might force you to slightly consider the other players choices in actions.

(Don't get me wrong: Yes, I'll probably still like my occasional Agricola play, and a yearly Le Havre play, and a yearly multiplayer Bohnanza game, but that really is enough Uwe for me, thank you)

I played this game every day for close to a month when I first got it! I was completely hooked on trying to win and kept losing! I've been winning more than losing in recent games but the low scores keep me coming back to try to better them. 

I still play occasionally but not nearly as much as during the honeymoon phase.

I've only played this game a couple of times, but it is really interesting and for now it's staying at a 9 until I can test it out a bit more.

The resource wheel is very clever. It prevents hoarding and requires a lot of clever management to make sure you make enough of some without sacrificing others, or to make sure you don't end up stuck in a position from depleting all your resources at once.

Slightly heavier game, in terms of rules and strategy/planning.

RATING: 5
Eigentlich zügig, aber das Aussuchen der Karten kann sich manchmal etwas ziehen. Und auch mit dem Planen ist es nicht so einfach, da die Mitspieler oftmals andere Karten Spielen als erwartet und dadurch die eigenen Pläne vereiteln. Ein Korrigieren ist aber in der laufenden Runde nicht mehr möglich, da ja bereits 5 Karten ausgesucht wurden.   
Die Produktionsräder sind super, auch die restlichen Mechanismen funktionieren, aber trotzdem gefällt mir das Ergebnis nur mäßig gut. So lange alle schnell ihre Karten wählen und locker drauflos spielen trägt die Spieltiefe über die Zeit, aber wenn die Mitspieler anfangen zu viel zu planen und dementsprechend lange Karten aussuchen, wird das Spiel schnell zäh wie Kaugummi!

I find this a better waste of time than Agricola, but still not too invested in it. The theme is pretty lame, and the role selection isn't as fun, tense or hilarious as Broom Service. It's ok and it's saving grace is that it could be quick to play if the players are fast and don't have AP.

RATING: 7.5
Lighter and faster playing than most recent Rosenberg games. Players have a matching set of action cards and each round choose 5 to play. Only 3 of those cards will be played down in the action rounds but the other 2 may be used if someone else plays them down. The cards each allow you to do two things, you get to do both if you're the only one that plays down that card, otherwise you choose one of the actions on the card. I always enjoy this element of group think. 

Actions are used to purchase buildings. You're trying to build a goods producing engine on your individual playing board that will ultimately generate VPs. After 4 rounds of playing actions the game is over.

Also to mention is an interesting goods wheel that you have to see to understand. If the wheel is empty on the 0 space of the wheel you turn it clockwise and it produces the more advanced goods that are needed to purchase many of the buildings. There's a balance in how you use this wheel to your advantage that I think is the key to game.

A nice combination of resource management and card drafting to plan your turn in the most open and flexible way (because the plans not always will go in the way you expected!)

first game I have played from this designer.  I opted for it as it was a shorter game than Agricola, Caverna, and Le Havre.  love the resource wheel, it makes keeping track of everything super easy.  when we play we tend to make it so that everyone gets 2 turns to go first.  So it gets more buildings into the game.  when played as per the rules it is a fast game.  I can see how some people find it lacks, but we really enjoy it.

Half this game feels very Rosenberg-ish: an 80/20 split between Ora et Labora and Agricola. But the other half feels like Witch's Brew or Race for the Galaxy. Correctly predicting what your opponents will select can be worth a nice bonus. Being incorrect can be inefficient or downright punishing, but in the latter case you were probably being too optimistic anyway. A very interesting merge of concepts that results in a clever game. I'm not sure how it stacks up against the designers other games, but it certainly is the shortest and in that context it is certainly worth playing.

Love the card play and trying to guess the cards that the others will play and see if I can cripple their moves and also benefit from them...

The Production wheel is also pretty cool and different from the normal type of production you have in games because one you have the resources it automatically produces the most it can produce and that way it will deplete your resources, so you have to manage it very carefully because sometimes you need the final products to be able to build a building but other times you need the basic resources and you have to be careful to get the right one so you don't produce and lose the resources you just got!

Really really cool game!

RATING: 8.2
This is a great-looking little Euro-game that demands a lot of focus by players.  The short length of the game means you don't have any time to relax, explore or screw around.  You need to find the combos in the building display, get them efficiently and then compliment or augment them without a wasted action.  With only 4 rounds, it is crazy tight.

This was a nice surprise, as I typically don't like Uwe Rosenburg games. I would probably rank this my 3rd favorite of his behind Patchwork and At the Gates of Loyang. It seems like whenever he isn't doing a farming simulator, I tend to like his modern stuff, for the most part.

Glass Road is pretty simple. It has some San Juan/Race for the Galaxy-like card play along with a little bit of engine building. The main feature is the resource board, which is actually really cool. It reminds me of the gears from Tzolk'in in that it seems like a gimmick, but actually tracks things much easier than if you had to do it manually. The game is a bit on the simple side, though I did enjoy it. It just feels like it's missing...something. I can't quite put my finger on what, but it doesn't quite reach the heights of other great Euros for me.

An excellent game. The game is still about the managing efficiency like most of Uwe's game, but the mind game of guessing your opponent's card choices really shine here. 

You benefit from guessing what your opponent, but you als have to consider if your opponent benefits from your cards - added to the fact that the benefits might not warrant a change of strategy sometimes, making it a very balanced but interesting mechanisms. 

Most importantly, it plays short - less than one hour with non-AP prone player. A very handy game with enough depths.

Love how quick this is (45 minutes), and how it lends itself to back-to-back games. Love the resource dial both for its user interface and for the ebb and flow of resources it imposes.

RATING: 7.5
In this game, players have their own deck of 15 cards, and each round they secretly choose 5 cards to play. Three of the cards will be played; it is possible that your cards will match those selected by the opponent. The cards depict two actions on them and you can do both if no one else chose the card, othewise all players who chose the card get one action. So there is some guess work on what opponents might want to play if you want to get more actions. 

There are 4 rounds, and you try to build VPs. The wheels from Ora Et Labora are used here. Each player has 2 wheels, one with glass, and one with brick. Glass and brick are only earned if all the other resources are advanced by at least one, then the wheel turns, you get less of the resources, but you will have one brick/glass.

It's a quick paced game and I enjoy it. There is a learning curve on all the available buildings. In the game, not all the buildings will come out, so you have to be flexible on your strategy. I'm looking forward to more plays.

Two crazy mechanisms in this game.  First there are the two goods wheels, brick and glass.  It is quite intuitive because as you gain resources, the 'clocks of the hand' will move whenever you have 1 or more resources of all kinds...when that happens you click the hand over one removing one of every resource, BUT gaining one resource of the Brick or Glass.  Quite intuitive way to show that all these resources are needed to create the Brick, or Glass!

The next mechanism that is quite 'Witch's Brew'-like, is how you select the role cards that will gain you resources and allow you to do things within the game.  Out of 15 cards you select 5 each round, three to play on your turn, and two to play on your opponents turn.  You'd preferably want to know what your opponents plan on doing so that you can play those two cards out of turn, AND play your three cards on your turn without anyone trying to leech, because you will only get a half action when doing so.

Lastly, there is your board where you place your three different types of buildings, Action, One-offs, and end game scorers.  

It all comes together quite good, just wish it was supposed to have ONE MORE ROUND...kind of like most of his games!

With all the hoopla surrounding Caverna, it would be easy to mistake Glass Road for the bastard stepchild of the 2013 Rosenbergs. But this game is a blast. It awesomely combines elements of Witch's Brew and Ora et Labora, and takes a very short amount of time for the level of strategy it inspires. The first game I've played in a while that I've wanted to buy.

Not sure this one is for us.  It's difficult to visualize the engine creation from the buildings.   Four rounds also seem too short to make that engine then work.  At least in the two player, few new buildings come out, so it can be hard to recover if the other player takes the path you had planned.  Also seems a little boring.   This one may need more players.

Another game that had been more than one year in my shelf. This was one of my main interests, but I was waiting for the special moment. Some days ago I saw at BGG that it was most recommended as a 2 players game, so when Joor and me had free 50 minutes this Sunday while everybody was playing something else, we went for it.

[url=http://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/12858598]Played on October 13th, 2014, at Laguna de Duero, with Jooor.[/url]

Rules are easy, but you need some time analyzing the character skills and what the buildings do. then you have to add 2-3 minutes for setup and you're good to go.

Components are very good; there are plenty of them, the cardboard is thick, the wooden tokens have stickers, the weels work perfectly. The box is heavy, and there's no air on it!

It has 2 unique features:
-> Production weels: original, they make the materials accounting much more easy and provide a secondary puzzle for the game. Very nice.
-> Actions are executed by choosing 3 characters out of a selection of 5 for this round. If you're the only one that chose this character, you play 2 actions; if more people chose him, each one only plays one of the actions.

These actions are the meat of the game, and they provide a nice challenge: second-guessing your opponents and deceivethem to get the max out of your turns, but at the same time be able to get everything you need to build the best buildings before them.

Luck is also a factor. Even if the game is a bit thinky, there's no AP, because you all choose your actions at the same time.

The key is that it lasts only half an hour. There are definitly better games out there, but the last 2-3-4 times as much!

I understand why it excels with 2 players: with more, it's more difficult to controkl what everybody is doing, the character coincidences are more luck dependant and it's easier to be stolen of the buildings you want.

There are 15 action cards with each having 2 actions and some of them A or B actions. So total action-pool is rather high. Especially considering you may either do 2 or 1 actions / card depending how other players play ... and part of the game would be to predict how they play to maximize your number of actions you can do. Every player chooses 5 cards but can only play 3 of them but you can leech onto other players cards if you have them in your hand. So you can get benefit of 3-5 cards and depending on how other players play, you can get benefit of 3-8 actions... To make it worse you cannot completely predict WHEN you can make actions as it can sometimes be decided by other players.

So in 4 player game it is rather chaotic, especially the part about when you actually can do actions. In 2 player game the amount of chaos is much less but the outguessing (or more likely just semi-randomly picking something other player is going to play) becomes bigger part of the game.

Gaining resources is rather unique and quite nice mechanism. But when combined to action-chaos it is really hard to plan anything really.

Mixed opinions. All mechanics as-is are cool but amount of (potential) actions and their timings are making it really hard to do any real decisions. It's more like guidelines how this turn is going to play out and I don't like that.

Revolves entirely around the outguessing/leeching system. Choosing cards for the round can cause massive AP but I'm willing to play this with fast players. Lots of variation in the setup, thanks to the large number of building tiles in the deck.

Wonderful, unpredictable, outrageous. Given Rosenberg's tendencies towards excess in his farming games, this comes as a massive surprise and is all the better for it. The bluff and second-guessing in the role selection perfectly crown the condensation of mechanics from Ora et Labora. The variety of buildings is plenty to satisfy the combo-addicts, although even with a limited selection the game feels far from solved. I fell for this about two rounds into my first play and it hasn't let up yet.

 [b]Glass Road[/b]

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (10):[/COLOR]

[i]Still one of my favorite games, and definitely my favorite resource conversion game. Depending on the day either Loyang or Glass Road would be my favorite heavier Uwe game (I'm currently also obsessed with Patchwork which is a much lighter game). This is a game I am always willing to play and it really isn't very difficult to teach. That said it takes a play or two to get comfortable manipulating the resource wheels. I still haven't mastered setting up combos with the different buildings, but it love the amount of variety in the buildings. Especially when you look at all the ways buildings will give you bonus points and then figuring out how to use the different production buildings to maximize your points.The wheel is also an elegant solution to having numerous amounts of resource chits (ala Le Havre) to keep track of. 

I still view glass Road as an under appreciated gem designed by Uwe that plays great with 2 and finishes in under an hour. I can't recommend this game highly enough. My only disappointment is that my wife no longer wants to play, on the flip side my son has actually started requesting plays. [/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (9):[/COLOR]

[i]- Plays great with 2
- Quick playtime: 20 minutes per player is accurate.
- Resource management including how the production wheels work when producing bricks and glass.
- Card play: having to chooses which workers you want to use while also trying to figure out which ones your opponents may want to use (this reminds me a bit of RFtG).
- The buildings that are available from game to game really change your strategy, and make this a game with a lot of replay value.
- Great production quality, love the eater eggs found in the artwork on some of the tiles.

This may not be Uwe Rosenberg's best game design, but it is probably my favorite. A big part of this is the combination of short play time and this is a game my wife has recently been requesting to play. She does not usually like games with lots of moving parts, but after a couple of plays this game has clicked with her. Glass Road is a game that will see consistent play for a long time.

Wonderful game that is very simple to learn and play. The rulebook is very concise. I wasn't quite sure if I was excited about this game or not when I purchased it. I am very glad I did because the game play is very unique and fun. The mechanics are clever and fresh. It reminds me of my first game of Puerto Rico (I am not saying this game is like Puerto Rico at all btw) when I discovered for the first time that everyone had a chance to play on the active players turn. 

Each player has their own deck of 15 cards (exactly the same). Each player then chooses 5 of them to hopefully get to play. When the active player chooses their card to play and someone else has chosen the same card in their hand of 5 cards, they get to play that card too. If the active player is the only one to pick that card, then he gets the benefits of both offers on the card. If someone else chooses the same card then you each choose one of the offers on the card. 

The glass and brick resource wheels are ingenious. They are really an clever aspect and fun part of the game. And the game playing space is kept very neat without piles of resources all over the table. It's all kept neat and tidy on each players own personal resource wheels. 

This game has great replay ability. The piles of tiles that you can build in the game are plentiful and you won't get through them all in one game or even two. You basically build what you can in only 4 rounds, and try to connect your plans through what you are able to buy with resources. Through clever placement of tiles or resource strategies the winner will be the one with the most VP and the VP's won't be huge either.

*資源輪，只要棕色區上方沒東西就會轉，在每次完整行動後轉(一張卡的一個行動就算)
*3~4人流程，每輪從15張選五張，全部一起蓋著出一張，起始玩家開始開，如果此時其它玩家手上有一樣的牌就出出來(蓋著的不算)，所以有該牌的玩家動作(付資源 二選一動作)，如果是唯一一個出該牌的，兩個都可作，此流程進行三輪(跟出的牌上限兩張)
*三張牌的輪次結束，補建築物跟順時鐘換起始玩家，遊戲在四輪後結束，算所有建築分數，最多的獲勝

*隨時行動包括建築物的箭頭轉換跟森林以外的地景移除
*磚邊的建築是基礎建築的升級，會取代掉基礎建築
*如果希望玩久點可以玩五輪
*兩人遊戲 由起始玩家開始輪流出牌，直到有人沒牌出就結束(如果有玩家有三張手牌則可在出一張)，跟出最多也只能出兩張
*solo 玩七輪，每輪選3-4-5-6-3-4-5張牌，選玩牌後洗勻抽一張使用一個能力，直到剩兩張，開起來選一張使用全部能力，上輪選的牌這輪不能選

Love this entry from Mr. Rosenberg. A lot of what I can't stand about his games (notoriously AP prone, general and boring mechanics) are missing from this game with the introduction of simultaneous role reveal with cards and a darling little wheel/clock mechanic that creates glass and brick. It plays fast and light for a light-to-medium strategy game. The only drawback is not being able to access the full compliment of the game's victory-point-scoring tiles: you see about 40-50% of the game's tiles during a 4 player game. I have a low tolerance for these types of games but Glass Road is unique enough and fast enough for me to play a couple more times.

RATING: 7
Solid design. Standard game in many ways of playing cards to get resources, play cards to build buildings, buildings will help build an engine or score points, most points wins. A bit of focus on engine at the start, but you need to work out quickly how you're going to score your big end-game points as you'll only get 16 or so actions through the game to resource gather and build. So you need to then focus on selecting complementary buildings to boost that scoring mode, and drive single-mindedly towards it. The card/action selection mechanic is interesting ... you can game it a bit by choosing popular choices, and mid-game by choosing both likely choices (to share) and non-likely choices (to get double) that benefit only you. But no doubting there can be a big slice of luck in the order in how they the cards get played out (as well as guessing right in what other people choose). Everything works well, nice components and all. The only thing stopping me rating it higher is the uneven tempo of the game. If a player takes a building you'd focused towards just before your turn, you may need some "minutes" to work out how to readjust your turn and determine whether to change track or not. Because actions are finite, every action wasted (either thru card selection "luck" or this tactical cease-and-replan) can be important, so there can be some paralyzing downtime at times. Interesting to explore, engaging game choices, but not a laugh-a-minute game, one of contemplation and then re-contemplation.

Yup, a Rosenberg Euro alright. Build buildings, manage resources, work toward point combos, all within between 12 to 20 "turns". Complex, yet a faster game than the Uwe's other heavies. Get through the basics of the game, then dig in to see everything working together. The possibilities really unfold for potential scoring combos to be obtained. A different game every time, due to the many randomized building types.

Not a great 2-player. I have not tried solo.

A very fun game by Rosenberg, especially for just two players. It sets up quick, plays relatively fast, and provides gameplay unlike anything else in my collection. Both Kristy and I really enjoy trying to "read" each other to guess what cards we are going to play.

I recently tried out the solo game too, which is quite good! I can see my self playing this often in pursuit of that mythical 30 points.

My favorite Uwe Rosenberg game!  I like the weight of this one; not as heavy as most of his bigger games.  But still offers lots of those great Uwe decisions.  I really like the card selection/action selection and having to think about what other players are going to be selecting.  I like that layer of strategy.  Of course choosing the different types of buildings and building your "engine" is fun.  And I like the puzzle quality of placing/removing tiles from your individual board.  Oh, and the resource wheels are very unique in how they automatically will generate glass and brick when you gain other resources.  Managing those wheels is very important.  The game requires that you play a different strategy every game, giving it great replayability.  This Uwe game hits my sweet spot!

Will have to play this again and RIGHT before rating it. Three people read the rulebook and all of us got the rule wrong. In the hindsight it seems obvious what was meant but we played it wrong. In the rulebook is mentioned "Kartenrunden" and we thought it meant we had to play 3 times 3 cards (all 15 cards) before a new "Kartenrunde" begins. We didn't know what to do after the second round.

RATING: 6
There seems to be so many games just like this one. You collect a vast amount of resources to use them to buy buildings to convert goods and that give you points. This one has a wheel mechanic where two resources are more valuable and the main method to get these is by getting all the other resources and causing your wheel to turn, thereby getting one rare resource in exchange of one of each of the others. But for me it is a pass, too similar but not as good as the many other similar games. It is a bit shorter at 40-80 minutes, but less fun.

A deceptively simple-looking game, with a ton of depth. Looking at it, it seems like a pretty dry theme (and admittedly I never felt like an 18th century Bavarian glass worker while I was playing), but it's really a fantastic game. 

What seems like simple resource management becomes quite a bit more complex with the rondel mechanic that automatically creates glass and bricks the moment you have enough resources. Sometimes you have plans for that charcoal, but then you got some sand, and now you have more glass and less of everything else!

The building tiles add even more depth to the game. You won't use more than 5-6 each game, and with 92 of them included in the box, you'll never run out of combinations!

Glass Road is a surprisingly fast resource management game that features simultaneous action selection.  Players choose which actions they're going to use on their turn, and then reveal those actions in three rounds of play--but if someone else has the same action, both players get a lesser version of that action immediately.  Planning is difficult in this game, because essentially you can't be sure in which order your actions will happen.  This, and the fact that buildings can be unintentionally sniped by other players can make this a little bit of a frustrating experience sometimes.  I still found the game enjoyable, but you really have to be into contingency planning.

This is the definition of plenty to do and not enough time to do it. I found that this game was far too short for what it wanted to be. You barely feel like you have something going and it's already over. Normally this intrigues me to some degree, but it just felt fairly bland. And when points came down to .5, it never felt that interesting.

Overall a game I would play, but not go out of my way to get to the table. I ended up trading it out and I don't regret it.

Glass Road is a really nice change-of-pace from the recent Rosenberg wheelhouse (which I tend to like). Each player has the same deck of role cards and selects which he or she will play during one of the four rounds of the game. That selection, along with the timing of playing them, determines whether the player does one or both of the actions on the role card. This all leads to a nice interactive bit of the game, where a player is trying to get inside the head of his opponents. The rest of the game is a pretty standard resource-converting-to-resource-converting to points affair. That said, the whole package is nicely put together, plays relatively quickly, and made for a really good euro experience. I will be very happy to play this one some more.

I am not good at this game.  I like the card play and engine building.  We often play an additional round to give the engine more time to...build.  As with many games with variable set-up the building combinations available in a particular game can vary quite a bit in how interesting they are.  You go through relatively few buildings in a game, so you don't always get a  balanced set. That is a minor quibble. This is probably my second favorite Uwe game.

Only 1 play, but this is for me by far for the moment the best game from Essen 2013. It's easy to explain, playing time is (with the right players :D) quite short (65 minutes for 4 players in our first game) and there is a lot of strategy involved. As there are quite a lot of buildings, I assume replayability will be high.

Edit 25/01/2016: I wouldn't recommend the solo-game. The fact that you have to shuffle your cards makes it a bit of a crapshoot. And there is also no categorisation. In the rules the only thing that is marked is that '30 is exceptional', but it would have been nice if there was something like '< 15 bad, 16 -20 OK,...'.

Ora et Labora light, quite fun! The resource dials are nifty, but ultimately this is very much a "trade x in for y, then combine to get z so I can make the p I need to transform q into r" and it becomes quite tricky to see where that leaves you, and how to make the most points from that. The game is only 4 rounds, of 3-5 cards each, so most of the playing time is spent calculating. A little too much work for a relatively light game.

RATING: 5
Resource conversion puzzle, the main aim being to trade in to draft buildings to place on your tableau. Buildings either provide conversion benefits, one off benefits or for the required vps (fixed or variable) to score after 4 rounds of play.

One problem to address is that your tableau board is already occupied with forest, vegetation, ponds and sand pits, which provide resources if discarded or kept.

The mechanism that allows you to gain, discard and build is similar to that in Witches Brew in that you select 5 from your hand of cards (same as everyone else). One of the selected cards is place face down, then in turn a player declares the face down card. If you hold the matching one in your hand you get to play it. There are two forms of kicker here: if you are the only one to select that 'role', trade in the resource if necessary and you get to do both listed actions on the role, otherwise you only get choose one and the other player(s) choose one as a bonus. This was one of the few aspects of game I liked as it can elicit your greed, causing some emotional tension and drama in the denial. Also the reveal is the fun part with the coincidence of selections.

The other aspect is deducing which of the 5 cards other players will pick. Your source of information is not only the busy tableau or building draft board, but mainly the players individual resource inventory board, which is the novel part of the game. Resources gained and paid are marked with discs moving forward and back around a wheel, but the novelty lies in the fixed clock hands which move according to gaps left by the leading or last resource(s). This movement generates or uses up a very valuable resource: glass on one wheel and brick on the other (hence Glass Road). 

Strangely all the mental work involved, scores are unit increments so are close (which I like), but again the scores are fractured, variable and scattered so no tension there unless you wish to do the maths.

Playing with 4 makes for a resource conversion, deduction headache, and the overall feel is it seems too chaotic and difficult to plan, and it doesn't help with the wheels being a challenge as you discover that gaining a resource going last forces the clocks hands to "manufacture" glass/brick and reducing your moved resource to zero. Curse that efficiency!!! Maybe interested in playing with 2 (BGG recommendation) as the theme is there almost, but I suspect it isn't my taste, with Gates of Loyang being a strong contender (being more thematic) for a Rosenberg farming design I'm happy to play.

This is a very quick playing, very minimalistic resource management game. Each player gets a wheel with resource tokens to indicate how much of each thing you have, a set of cards identical to other players, and a player board with some spots for buildings and more covered spots you can clear off. Each player then selects one action from their hand, and you get a bonus for playing a card in a round that nobody else has left in their hand, and if they do have the card, they get to get half the effect. It creates a really interesting push your luck element, but it can be difficult to keep track of without several plays under your belt.

The game is also extremely short. In my group we have some AP prone players, and it takes an average of an hour and a half including rules explanation. I felt overwhelmed by this game on our first few plays, but now I'm getting the hang of it and enjoying it more and more.

Brilliant.  An absolute triumph for Uwe.  Takes the fun of Agricola style world building, throws in a cool trick taking type card mechanic, and wraps it up in under an hour for three players.  Next level board gaming.  Highest possible recommendation.

The wheel mechanism is great twist, really makes you think about which resource combinations you want. I also like the subtle thinking about what your opponents to will do. Yes you want some overlap so you can take advantage of their choices, but not too much so you can get some double actions. 
Like how the forest clearing provides resources and building room and the number of building tiles gives a good bit of variety to the play.
The resource management is very constrained

I love most of Uwe's games, and Glass Road is another hit from that genius designer. I like his other games more, but this is another good game. 

It's quicker which is nice but still leaves your head spinning with difficult resource management decisions. The action selection is a bit weird as well, where you're trying to select a few roles that only you will benefit from while also selecting some that others might use. 

Ultimately while I enjoy it, I'm not sure it's a game I want to really explore the depth of because I think it may be a bit shallow--it seems quite a bit of the end result is determined by some of the building grabs along with who "outguesses" their opponents the best in role selection. That's fine, but it's not a game I can see playing dozens of times like I can and have with several others.

Glass Road is very clearly a Rosenberg engine, only with none of the fussy bookkeeping overhead. Prior to this, handling chits and cubes and making change were all necessary parts of the overhead for a Rosenberg game. Ora et Labora kind of hinted at something tidier, but unfortunately the cool resource wheel in OeL was still attached to a plodding multihour competition in strategic component sorting. 

Glass Road still sees you dragging wood and peat through a flowchart searching for clay and food, but you're not manually handling anything. This cuts just a [i]huge[/i] amount of non-value-add stuff from the game. And the forced production is really, really good. Not only does it prevent resource hoarding, but it also helps the game actually end in a reasonable amount of time. 

Even at 2p, the cardplay matters, though I'm in a strange place with it: it'd be more interesting with three players, but then you'd have someone else to extend the game. I don't know that I'd be cool with this if it took much longer. But unlike a lot of Euros where you want to Do What Your Opponents Are Not Doing, in Glass Road you want to get a little close to their strategy but not too close. That's a knife edge. I'm totally fine with those.

A game that I am totally considering buying.

The resource wheel is nice, but the second-guessing part is not for my taste. Also, the rest of the game is very straightforward variation of "gather resources, build buildings, use them" and not particularly good one in that respect. There are simply too many buildings with too complex resource requirements which slows the game down, especially since the graphical design is not very good.

I love the piggybacking in this game. Per period you pick five cards from 15 and per round each player chooses a card. First player announces his first role card and if you have that card in your hand, you can do an action too.
Additionally there are two factories represented by the wheels and if there is one of each raw material in a factory, a good will be manufactured automatically.
These two are nice mechanics and the game flows fast. The down time is in studying the buildings that can be built. I think there are way too many.

We played this just once so far but it was pretty good. I think I hyped this game up a lot because it took me a long time to get a hold of a copy for a great deal.

It might just have been my first impression so I definitely want to give it more of a chance.

Meh. A perfectly playable game, but it's yet another get-the-resources-build-the-buildings game from Uwe Rosenberg. They're all starting to feel alike, and he's done it better. The rotating dial gadget that forces you to turn raw resources into glass and brick is cute but basically just enforces making glass or brick whenever you have enough ingredients; it's not a new mechanism in terms of gameplay.

I am not the biggest Rosenberg fan. I think Caverna and Agricola are fine, but I find Glass Road to be a little bit boring for me. I think the artwork is beautiful, and the clockwork mechanic for resources and removing of agriculture on player boards to be neat. However, I think the game is just not for me. It is charming, and I know people will like it. I would just say try before you buy.

I've come to the conclusion that Uwe's games tend to be too fiddly for me.  I like medium-heavy Euros and appreciate his games for their balance and strategic elements, but I'm getting tired of moving 243252 pieces around the table.

This game, specifically, has a similar feel to some of his others (Caverna, Fields of Arle, Ora et Labora, etc).  If you enjoy those, you'll enjoy this.  If you don't enjoy those, you probably won't enjoy this.

I'm perfectly fine playing this game again and again...but I can think of dozens of other games I'd rather setup and play (mostly because the setup of Uwe's games just takes too long).

A super tight game that is really simply with respect to rules:  choose 5 helpers and go back and forth and chose one to play for three rounds.  If you play some one that someone else chose and they are in their hand they get to play it.  Do this four times and see who wins.  This game seems to need a lot of plays to get comfortable on what to do.  It just seems so wide open.  The resource manager wheel are ingenious.  They take down a ton of resource book work but also bring a dilemma  when with their automatic production.   Just a ton to digest with this one and has a really unique feel to it.  Tons of potential for this games rating to rise. 

Update:I bumped this one up a little more because it surprisingly plays as a satisfying experience as a solo game.  Not to heavy and plays in an hour or less.  Pretty quick to set up.  It has interesting decisions while still in the spirit of the game.   Obviously no interaction but there is more tactics brought in as cards come up a bit random so you may have to adjust.  Really liked this.

I really like this one. Fairly quick game although AP players may have some trouble. But the wide variety of tiles and card  play makes the game open different paths to victory each time you play. And what a masterfully sweet mechanic with the wheels that produce high end goods of brick and glass from the base resources. Really clever and unique. Well done Uwe!

March 2014: Didn't get to try it at Euroquest in November and disappointed by poor reviews.  But reviews started improving after a while and when I saw it for 50% I had to grab it.  It's actually a fun, little game with a short play time.  And the method for handling the resources (with the wheels) is terrific.  I would certainly suggest you try it before assuming that the negative reviews are accurate for your tastes.

I've played this about four or five times since receiving it for Christmas in 2013, including games with 2, 3 and 4 players. At first I was a bit disappointed, but now I think I like the game. It is extremely quick, much quicker than I expected - without rules explanation, I really can't see this taking much more than half an hour. That is no bad thing, of course - but it has more components than many 2-3 hour brain-burners, so setup takes about as long as the game itself! Add in rules explanation (which takes a fair while, even though the basics of the game are simple - but you have to explain how the production wheels work, how the card rounds go, what actions you can do at any time, what the different type of buildings are, describe what the different cards do...), and the game itself seems to take up only a fraction of the time this game is on the table. It is also very hard to plan for anything very much, at least early in the game, and while there is certainly an element of trying to anticipate which cards your opponents will choose, most of the time you're thinking more about how to make sure you can build the buildings you need at the right time, while also trying to maximise your score from the ones you've already built (or plan to build later). Definitely more a tactical game than a strategic one.

I thought I would really love this game, and I definitely like it. But no-one else I've played the game with has seemed that taken with it, and it falls awkwardly between the two stools of light filler and challenging strategy game. For that reason, as well as the inevitable arrival of new games to claim my attention, this is now very rarely a game I would actively suggest to play. But I do still enjoy it on the very occasional times when it does come out.

A decent solo game, not overly strategic but enjoyable enough. 2 players is OK, and what the game seems to have been designed for. At 3 and 4 however the interaction seems random and the strategy very thin on the ground. And the game is so short that the overall experience feels chaotic more than tactical.

Update 2015-09-30: I'm leaving my early comment here, but I have been surprised how interesting the game play is, overall, making up for the somewhat tedious Uwe signature abundant and constant resource conversion. I stand by my claim that 3-4 player games devolve into uncontrollable chaos.

(+) Plays like greased-lightning: a meaty experience in just an hour or so of gameplay.
(+) Tried and true resource conversion to points mechanisms present, with a conversion wheel that makes the process flow seamlessly.
(+) Provides a minor means of player interaction and some double-think guessing that can be rewarded, through clever action card selection.

(-) At its heart, it is just resource conversion, and not particularly exciting at that.
(-) The game seems to end abruptly, just when you have your said resource-engine starting to hum.
(-) Plays out mechanically. You spend your time eke-ing out points here and there, rather than feeling like your game state is developing and your strategic options are flourishing.

Really love the abacus-like resource wheels - very ingenious.  Just wish there was a more interesting game attached to it - it feels like a Rosenberg version of a Feld game. The second guessing aspects of the card play is interesting - it feels pretty random though.  Basically the game boils down to studying the building and trying to build one or two nice combos. It should play pretty fast, but it seems like we were constantly waiting to check if anyone had a copy of the revealed card in their hand and people had to constantly be reminded it's their turn.

A quick game of selecting a hand of roles that do things, then playing them out, and getting the full effect if you were only one that picked the role, and only half if someone else picked the same role (though you select more roles than you get to play, so you want to pick some to collide with other players to get free actions).  It offers a paralyzing amount of simultaneous choices—pick 5 of 15 roles, then pick which you want to play, keeping in mind which buildings you want to buy and resources you want to generate which are converted to other resources via a fiddly wheel mechanic.  Your ability to predict what will actually happen is limited though, given the complexities of interacting with other players's choices.  It felt like a lot of work for fairly little reward.

Another value packed game by Uwe Rosenberg - 16 punch boards (and some assembly work), pack this box again to the brim. There's just no room for an insert, so obviously the publisher is saving a ton of money there.

It plays very nicely. The Ora et Labora resource wheel is there in duplicate with wheels representing your glass and brickworks. Your mind will bend as you try to boost your all important glass and bricks without screwing up the rest of your stock of raw resources. Lovely.

However the hook for this game is the card playing mechanic, which is simple and yet intriguing. Pick five out of 15 cards a turn and if you can play a card nobody else has in their hand then you'll get to utilise both actions on it. If someone else has the card then you both get to utilise one of the actions on the card. So optimally over the three direct card plays per turn you'll be looking to play three unique cards and pick two others you're sure your opponents will be playing. Simple mechanic, but hard to do. It's not at all blind bidding because there's some real deduction and second guessing going on.

The theme is an interesting one. A huge bonus is that the game plays in about an hour once you know what you're doing and it gets a little ratings boost for this fact alone. Turns are fast and engaging, with some agonising decisions throughout the game, but especially as the game draws to a conclusion. That said, the downtime is minimal, although I guess this could depend upon your group. Points are simple to calculate. We have a winner!

The only possible downsides I can see is that some of the building combinations are hugely powerful, but it should be nothing that aware opponents can't attempt to level out if they are on top of their games. The rulebook is also a tad verbose and makes searching for things slow on a first play as points dealing with one particular aspect are spread over multiple non consecutive pages. You won't need to refer to it after the first play though.

-----------
iOS version: Just about one of the worst apps I've come across. Never been able to finish a game - the game has frozen half a dozen times - frozen as in frozen. I've waited a few minutes for the AI to think, or for something in the background to do something, but after five minutes I declare it to be "frozen". A pity.

Got to play this when my first game at LT XVI had to be switched.  Wow.  Very impressed with the wheel mechanic.  MUCH better than the one in Ora et Labora, which can be very scripted.  Unlike OeL, Glass Road is not scripted.  You only use a portion of the buildings, so replay value should be pretty high.  I really liked how you can manipulate the wheel to your advantage as well as how sometimes you can get screwed on it.  Well done, and I'm not someone who generally cares too much for Uwe's designs.

Another great Rosenberg game.  We love the production wheel aspect of this game.  Very fun!  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The inherent chaos of simultaneous role selection typically relegates the mechanism to dime-a-dozen filler games, but Glass Road breaks this mold by incorporating it into a more substantial game. Much like in [thing=34084][/thing], players here [i]want[/i] some degree of clashing with their opponents, in addition to a few unique picks. There are also other design nuances to consider as well, such as dealing with cards which are flushed out prematurely from your hand.
 
Being a Rosenberg game, there is also an inevitable element of resource management and conversion. Manipulating the resource wheel is initially a little brain-bending, but actually works very well. All this is brought full circle by the conversion of resources into points, represented here by buildings. The overall design smartly ensures that getting more actions through role selection isn't a clear advantage; the right buildings must be purchased or any extra actions are otherwise wasted.

Glass Road is fairly light, decent Euro fare. The card selection mechanism outshines the resource management bit, but both parts really complement each other well. It would be interesting to see a similar mechanism implemented in a lighter filler though. The rules overhead for the game may be on the high side for a game which can be done in about an hour.

Love it. Quick and every time I can play a card from my hand I feel like I accomplish a kick ass move. Set collection game and you're squeezing every point and half point out of it. The wheel resource markers are fantastic and add a layer of complexity and strategy to the game.

Picked this up because I'm a sucker for simultaneous action selection. Plays as fast as everyone says it does, with a very high density of decisions. Michelle seems to spend a lot of time deciding which buildings to make (even when it's HER builder!), which is a little annoying. It does feel a little short with only 4 building periods. 

I've never played Witch's Brew (since it doesn't play with 2 at all), so the action selection was pretty novel to me. It is pretty neat and brainburn inducing, although the incentives are a little different in 2-player than multiplayer. For 3- and 4-player games, you pretty much always want 3 unique and 2 matching. In 2-player, the second player wants the same, while the first player actually does better with just one matching.  

There is a surprising amount of interaction for a non-confrontational game, and I like that it forces you to keep a close eye on what your opponent is doing. 

The wheel isn't so much a mechanic as it is just a bookkeeping tool (of course, the glass and brick resources had to be designed with the wheel in mind, or none of it would work). It serves its purpose well and helps to keep the game moving.

The production wheel is an awesome idea. Other than that, it's an Uwe Rosenberg with another variation of the by now well-known theme -- producing goods to convert to other goods to produce more goods to build buildings to produce more goods. Thanks to the production wheel a lot less on the fiddly side than usually, but also more centered about exactly two goods (glass and brick) as opposed to the more open approach of earlier games. I'm not too fond of the forced production of glass and brick either, which in my opinion just needlessly complicates the micro-optimization, but that can be easily remedied with a house rule.

The big difference though is the action selection mechanism with the (not always desired) following of other players. I'm badly undecided what to think of that one -- on the one hand, it makes the game much more interactive than the usual simple competition for common resources (buildings, ...). On the other, it can completely mess with your plans in a way that dangerously leans towards the too unpredictable side.

Glass Road was quite a surprise for me as it initially didn't look like the type of game that I would enjoy. However, I found the card play to be quite enjoyable and the quasi-bluffing aspect of choosing which specialist to use and when was great fun. In typical Rosenberg fashion, the game features many tiles which can make setup a pain. I have found that using bags for the different tile types helps. The player resource wheels also make storing the game difficult. Some in my group have complained that it doesn't last long enough, but I enjoy it since it forces you to commit to what you are doing. The game works better with more players in my opinion, but it isn't bad with two or even solo.

May be my favorite Rosenberg game.

It's very strategic in a way, because the type of buildings you get to choose from at the beginning of the game doesn't change. That gives you the opportunity from the first turn, to plan which buildings you want to aqquire to achieve victory. The other players can take the buildings before you do, but still...

Usually I'm more to tactical euros but this one is lighter and doesn't play for that long, which I really like. It does have some tactical elements too. ANd i really like the production wheel.

Great as a 2 player game and one that my wife enjoys too. Thumps up!

Another solid game from Uwe. It reminds me a bit of Ora and Labora with the resource wheel, although each player has their own. I like how the role selection is involved, so you've got that Citadels psychological aspect as well as building a nice resource engine.

1 play, 3er

The latest from Uwe Rosenberg. This one, though, plays much more quickly (maybe 60 min once you know the game?) while still giving you much to think about. The production wheel, originally seen in Ora et Labora, has been cleverly tweaked to manage resource collection and goods production: once you have enough of all the required resources, the are automatically consumed (1 each) to produce the advanced good (brick or glass). Like in Le Havre, the bazillion cards of Agricola have been cut way back, to roughly 30. They are now building tiles, only a random subset of which will be available each game. And the terrain stuff in Ora is also seen here, although simplified: several tiles on your player board, ability to acquire more.

Something brand new: a personal deck of action cards from which players select 5 each round (and play at least 3). 

Cool game, but:
- like Loyang, it's a low-VP game (around 20) so every half VP is crucial. 
- choices at the beginning seem overwhelming, with little guidance as to which cards to choose
- the production wheels feel vaguely like the Trajan circle: difficult to figure out how to manage it at first!
- it seems as if, to do well, you really have to figure out what actions other people are choosing (so you can piggy back onto them, getting up to 5 actions instead of your base 3)

I do, however, LOVE the production wheel -- so clever! A very nice refinement of the system!

I would like to try it again, but I'm not necessarily crazy about it right now. Maybe it's just a first-game thing, but it seemed too random as to whether or not you got bonus actions from other people's card choices.

Some games really are simply made by their mechanics.  This is one of those games.  Sure, the goal of the game is really to build structures that award victory points but the gameplay that is in service to this goal is what really shines for me.

There are two very original mechanics in this game that offer a breadth of interesting decisions and puzzles to tackle.  The first is the resource wheels each player has that manages the number of each resource they collect.  That phrase in and of itself doesn't make for anything original but each wheel is composed of two parts, one representing a refined good (glass or brick) and the other half representing all the goods that go into creating that refined good.  As soon as you have 1 or more of all of the unrefined goods (and as long as you haven't reached your maximum 3 of the refined good) the wheel moves on its own to create glass or brick and lowers the number of the other resources until either one hits zero or the refined good reaches its maximum.  On first inspection this may not seem like a problem, we want those refined goods, don't we?  Of course, but we also need many of the unrefined goods to build buildings (don't forget the goal of the game) and also fuel the abilities of those buildings.  The turn of the resource wheels cannot be stopped so often you can even find yourself getting some number of a good you need only to find it immediately converted into glass or brick and dropped back down to zero if you're not careful.

This is only one half of what makes this a very original game.  The other half is the card play that makes up most of the actual activity in this game.  Each player has a collection of 15 cards that allow them to collect resources, build buildings, and manage their player boards.  In each of the 4 rounds of the game players will select 5 of these 15 cards then across 3 turns play 3 of the 5 selected cards.  The interesting piece is that each card has two abilities on it.  If, when you play your card, no other player has that same card in their hand (either because they also played it that turn or they didn't select it as one of their 5) you can use both abilities.  But if another player does have that card in their hand then they get to play it "for free" and both players only get to use one of their abilities.  This means most rounds you are trying to choose 3 cards your opponents aren't going to so you get the most efficient use out of them while also selecting two cards your opponents will to hinder them and also get a couple free effects in the deal.  But there's even more to it than that.  With enough experience you can identify even more clever ways to interact with your opponent such as playing a builder role early in a round to force your opponent to remove it from their hand before they get a chance to collect the resources they need.

Like I said, technically the goal is to get victory points through the building of structures but I get so wrapped up in these very clever and puzzley game mechanics that it's even easy to lose sight of that goal and just have fun with how the game is played.  The one negative criticism I will levy on the game is that it feels way too short and most of the buildings in the game max out at too low of a point total to really make any gains.  This results in a very truncated game feel where you didn't get to do enough and final scores all within a couple points of each other.  This is fixed easily enough though by adding a few more rounds to the game, I think.  Double the number of players seems perfect actually for 3-4 players (6 or 8 rounds instead of the suggested 4) because that evens out the number of times each player will have to play in each position.  8 rounds might feel a bit long though, I would have to test it out myself first.  But at 4 (and with 3 players) the game finished in under an hour and felt way too short.

Other than that one small gripe though (which just meant I didn't get ENOUGH) this is a fantastically clever game.  Another home run by one of my favorite designers.

Time of play is good. The wheel is fine and clever although it annoys me a bit that I suddenly end up with nothing because I produced glass! It's something players hardly control (apparently).

Buildings are game changers but I didn't find them very interesting and it bugged me a lot thinking on how many points do I get for this building even if I must discard a field that would give me also some VP for another different building. More than working hard to increase your amount of points, the feeling is more closed to numbers as you give up on something to build something better. It's not a problem for the game but it doesn't work very well for my personal taste.

Fairly decent game by Rosenberg. I always get a bit of a headache from these resource optimization games. Glass Road has that in spades and if people take too long picking their cards, it can be really painful. But actual game play is quite fast, so downtime is less than may appear at first.

Oh, and be prepared not to score many points. 4 points for a single building seems very good.

If you had told me that I'd play 2 new-to-me Ooooo-va Rosenberg games within a week (this and "Wurfel Bohnanza") and enjoy both of them, I'd wonder if you were smoking your Agricola harvest.  The whole "collect resources to buy stuff that either allows you to collect resources more effeciently or gives you victory points" is standard Euro-game fare (though very smoothly done in this particular game), but of course the aspect that turns everything on its head is those resource dials!  Rarely do even experienced gamers find such truly unique mechanisms in games!  Those things make managing resources a real mind-bender.  Everything else in the game is pretty straight-forward and plays out quickly (which I appreciate), though exactly how to tie everything together provides quite a challenge.  I also enjoy how the role selection goes down, and how identical character selection causes reduced effects (just see if I don't put a brick through your glass!).  The physical components are all quality products with pleasant artwork, so no complaints there.  This one gets a "thumbs up" from someone who doesn't often enjoy them Euro-type games.  Game design: 4.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 3/5  Total: 7.5/10

RATING: 5.5
Glass Road reminds me a lot of another recent release, Francis Drake, in that it marries a common kind of efficiency game (there worker placement, here the typical Rosenberg convert-things-into-other-things-with-one-million-unique-buildings) with a strong element of simultaneous second-guessing. In essence, action cards have two abilities, but if any other players have chosen the same card then each can use one of the abilities only. Much of the mental effort goes towards attempting to use both actions on your own cards and while also leeching from other players.

The convert-things-into-other-etc part of the game is a shallower retread of Ora et Labora, with similar resource wheels (though now per-player) and minor spatial considerations. While long conversion chains are one of the things that make other Rosenberg games interesting -- successfully building an engine to produce steel in Le Havre, for example, demands long-term planning -- Glass Road has only two level two resources, glass and bricks. In addition, buildings are drawn face down and players have no way of knowing whether one will even be available. The result is a far lighter and more tactical game.

Ultimately I feel precisely as I do with Francis Drake: the most interesting part is the second-guessing involved in action selection, but I'm fairly sure I would rather play a smaller game -- like R or Donburiko -- that dispenses with the tedious victory point conversion and packs the same tension into 1% of the time.

Has some interesting mechanisms with the resource wheel (which is very cool) and the whole leeching off other player's actions (decent). However, the whole thing feels so dry. You're just converting one good into another good into another good to get VP. Also, the game is so low in scoring that a lot of buildings synergize so well with each other that if they happen to come up (especially in a private building lot) one player can stomp the other easily.

Good game for a quick "resource salad conversion" fix, but I don't think it really has the legs that I look for in a game like this. Would much rather spend a bit extra time playing Le Havre.

Loved the resource wheel.  Very clever concept, along with the select five cards, play 3, with potential to wind up playing all five if someone else plays a card you selected before you actually play said card.  Described by Chris as Uwe Drag Race, and it totally applies.  With only 5 rounds you use your standard Uwe mechanisms to gain as many points as possible in only 5 rounds.  Moves super quickly but has that Uwe game recognition and feeling.  Loved it!  Eagerly awaiting the re-print in late 2017.

Overall, the game was pretty good. I think that to me, it felt very similar to caverna in that your building/estate will likely never really be complete/finished, which I'm not a huge fan of - since it feels like I'm building to something great and then just stop abruptly. The deduction and action selection is a really neat mechanic, and definitely not something I have often seen - which is great in making this a unique game that offers some tension based solely on the actions one decides to pick. Nonetheless, for me it didn't live up to they hype I hope it would, but I would still gladly play it again.

I like the card selection at the start of the round.  It feels like you are going to do some big things.  Then you play them, do some small calculations and possibly get a building.  This building might give you a small amount of  points or a minor ability to do those calculations better.  In the end you add up all the points and find everything was very equal to each other.  You or someone did the conversions a touch better and gets the win.

I thought I might like this game more but in the end I find it has nothing compelling to make me want to play it.  It feels like an amped up All Creatures Big and Small without the fun factor.  

Very nice looking but has that ACABS/Puerto Rico text on buildings look that's boring.  The conversion wheel is fun and works well.  If you like converting and optimizing in a condensed space this may be the game for you.  FYI - It has no theme whatsoever. I usually can bear with it but not on this one because that's part of what sold me on it. I think that's where it fails as a game.  It feels like math while playing and it ends very controlled.

Oh! My! God! This game is so tight. 4 rounds with 3 actions each (sometimes a bit more). And half the time you will only perform half the action. There is SO little time to get stuff done. The only way to play this is to choose a path on turn one and stick to it, or you will get no where. At least, that is what it felt like in this first game.
This game again has the resource dials we've seen in a couple of other Rosenberg games, but they work differently in this game, with production of glass and brick automatically happening when you produce certain other resources. A fun puzzle in and of itself.
Gameplay is quite fast, rules are quite simple, but game play seems to offer meaningful decisions. And with the huge stacks of buildings, replay value should be very high.
I was pleasantly surprised by this one, even though my score of 12.5 was quite miserable.

Money is very tight and it is hard to squeeze points out of the game.  The resource wheel is really neat and functional.  I had a problem reading the small text on the tiles due to my aging eyes.  I thought it was a neat game and would be interested in trying it again to see if grabs me a little tighter next time.

Keeps up the European trend of sounding very complicated, but is pretty easy to play. It's also probably one of the few games out there where you can hear players swearing about being forced to make glass by mistake.

RATING: 7.6
interesting game, a lighter Uwe Rosenberg game
interesting mechanics (resource wheels, choosing+matching of role cards, landscape crafting with tiles, available buildings give strategies)

The resource wheels are a bit odd. If you think you have all resources, production consumes resources until maxed out or one resource is back to 0. Makes it rather hard to plan resources.

I like the mechanic with the role cards, choosing 5 from 15 in order to play 3 that no other player has chosen and 2 to try to match what another player plays. That allows for some light mind games. Only problem is that it sometimes takes too much time to make the decisions because it is hard to get an overview over the 15 cards plus offered buildings and resources.

The landscape crafting is also nice, but I think it's not fully balanced.

I like that different strategies open up depending on the available buildings. You basically need to choose a strategy that is (1) available, (2) do-able with the given actions and resources, (3) that none of the other players does and (4) that doesn't conflict with what else you do/did. At the very least it's a tough planning exercise. ;)

Only 4 rounds makes it tough to get something build up. Resources are usually very tight.

Possibly my favorite Rosenberg action-selection game in terms of mechanics (I enjoy Agricola's theme more). The game is tightly focused and quicker playing than other similar offerings. As in a game like Le Havre, Glass Road revolves around selecting actions and maximizing points via the purchase of buildings. And like many of Rosenburg's games, having a solid understanding of all the buildings ahead of time is the only way to approach the game skillfully. This is a negative for me because I am asked to play and learn these games on the fly -- and I do not have a strong desire to study the game when not playing. That said, there is much to like in Glass Road, especially if you are a fan of designers like Rosenburg or Feld.

Of note is the action selection mechanic, which forces you to anticipate what others might play. This helps ameliorate the feeling of multi-player solitaire. Also interesting are the resource dials, which are unintuitive at first, but then reveal themselves as a brilliant way to emphasize and streamline the collection of the two most important resources: glass and brick.

I love the 'buildings' in Rosenberg's other titles, so a game that hones in on this gets a tick from me. Plus a euro that adds a tinge of bluffing, another tick. Initially I thought the resource wheel was a dumb idea, but it works, and it's fun, and just another feature that keeps you honest.

I just couldn't wrap my head around this/ didn't find access to the game at all. It's got all the acclaimed advantages. It's a short Rosenberg, it's explained in a short amount of time and it plays fast. However, it was already at the end of turn 2 that I felt a little hopeless and with no solution on how to catch up. In the end I lost considerably, mostly due to the fact that I picked the "wrong" cards. Which means that I hardly ever got to participate on my opponents' cards when they were able to take advantage of my cards. I'm not sure yet wether I like that mechanic or not. You have to pay so much more attention to what resources your opponents need and when they need them. Actually you have to pay more attention to your opponents than to your own tableau. The game up to this point is an okay game with not much desire to play it again soon.

RATING: 7
Really good! When this first came out I thought it looked like another generic euro game and a lot of reviewers seemed to think that as well. The reality is that they were right - it's a pretty basic euro - but it has a few strong selling points.
You're gathering resources and turning them into victory points just like in any other euro. But the card play mechanic and the resource gathering, via a dual resource wheel, both feel like fresh takes on the genre.
You each select five cards and you'll get to play at least three of your cards every round. If you play a card that somebody else has in their hand, they get to play that card out of turn, meaning they basically get free extra actions and it's possible to play all five cards each round if you're lucky. You're playing cards in order to gain resources that allow you to build buildings, buildings which can dictate how many points you'll score at the end of the game. When you gather resources you have to plan carefully because some resources will produce automatically and consume other resources in the process thanks to the production wheels.
The simplicity is also a big plus. The cards and buildings are all straightforward and easy to read with minimal iconography. After an initial learning game, the rulebook has only been needed for the occasional reference.
The game also doesn't overstay its welcome. A game tends to last around an hour even with three or four players.

Overall this game was really a pleasant surprise.

Got this one for my birthday. Excited to get this to the table.

::UPDATE:: 4/21/2015

So, this game has grown on me. What I like about it is how much brain burning it packs into such a short time frame. What I don't like about it is how much brain burning it packs into such a short time frame. Basically, if I'm in the mood for it, I'll be craving it. But if I'm not, I want to stay far away from it. 

Why is this? I think--after analyzing it plenty in my mind--it's because I feel like there's very little wiggle room. I recognize that the combos that you can create from the variety of tiles in the game create a game space for endless possibilities, but all those possibilities seem to feel very much the same to me, and they all feel restricted(?). I don't know the word for it, but it's there. It's super tight, and not calculating right, not planning well with your action cards, and all that can feel really devastating when you don't do it well. On the other hand, it's very satisfying when you play it right/well.

I'll be keeping it, because there are times when it's all I want to play. And the fact that my niece and I can whip out a game from opening the box to closing the box in less than 40 minutes is amazing. 

I'm giving it an 8 for now. With further plays, it has the potential to climb.

I really like this one for some reason.  I think I like how open it feels, you can really specialize in a few things and play very differently from game to game.  There is some deduction of who's going to play what and when too (which becomes more feasible when everyone is familiar with the cards and not making illogical decisions).

The play time is quick, the rules are a total breeze (the translation in the manual is pretty rough, and unnecessarily hard to follow but the rules themselves are actually very simple), once you have it down you never need to reference the manual and it plays very smooth and in about an hour with 4.

At the moment one of my favorite games to get to the table.

First Impression:

A med.euro with a deduction mechanic!

This Frankensteins marriage works. Warning, this is not just another euro where guessing what your opponent wants to do is helpful because you can prepare for it or hinder it. In this game you get some real advantages if you guess correct and confuse your opponent from guessing. Actually that's the game, the rest is there for flavor, variety and different strategies - but nothing gives you the edge as outguessing your opponents actions. The game works, but I can see several players being frustrated by this mechanic.

I liked it, but I'd like to play more to comment more on the available strategies lying below the deduction/bluffing layer. This game is definately unique however.

Simultaneous action selection is a difficult mechanism to make work enjoyably, and this example did not impress. Strange action sharing mechanism. The dials are cool enough, but guessing what best to play and hoping to acquire buildings which match the cards you have agonized over selecting was not much fun. The game is growing on me a bit especially after trying it with two players. Rating raised from 4 to 6.

This game a has a bit of everything. It has a very innovative way to track resources, but there many resources and many many buildings. It is a short game. I believe if they had kept the buildings to a minimal and the resources to a fewer number (like everything in a single wheel), this would have been one of the greatest games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Glass Road is a bit of an awkward duck for me.  It feels like two different games.  The first half of the game is a card game where you're trying to predict what cards other people will choose.  The goal being that you pick 3 cards that no one else will and picking 2 that other's will.  This phase of the game is a little bit random and luck-based.

The second half of the game is a resource gathering and building game, more typical of what you'd expect of Uwe Rosenberg.  Some buildings give you on-going abilities, some of them have an immediate effect and some give you points at the end of the game.

My main problem with this game is that this game feels like it wants to be two different things.  On one hand it wants to be a solid resource gathering game where you build stuff... and on the other it wants to be a social deduction card game.  If it's going to be the former, then guessing which cards will be played is a little too random a way to determine if you're going to gather resources or have the chance to build.  And if it wants to be the latter, then you really don't need a complex building game tacked on.  Additionally, it's a little random if the right buildings come out for you or not.

I enjoy the game, but I'm not sure about whether it's a keeper for me or not.

RATING: 7
Well, I went to play this game after a promise of its teary owner that he could explain it in 5 minutes and that we would play in 40. Soon, the other player and I learned that the owner used trickery - he did explained in under 5 minutes, but he defended himself saying the time didn't included the 15 cards nor the buildings. We accepted this mainly because the game was all set and ready to go. But, be warned to not fall in the same trick! :)

So, the basics of [thing=143693][/thing] are: everyone has his own player board, filled with forests, glades, sand pits and ponds. Also, every player has a hand of 15 cards - they are all unique among themselves, but every player has the same ones. Of these, each round, you will choose five. After this, every player picks one of these 5 cards and place it face down in the table. The first player of the round reveals his card, and, if any other player has the same card [u]in hand[/u] it must be revealed. If no one has the card that was revealed in hand, the player uses both the actions of the card (every card has two, except one). If even one player has the card revealed in hand, the players that revealed the card and everyone else that had the same card in hand, can use one of the actions in the card (every player decides which, they don't have to be the same one). After everyone has had 3 turns (not countings the turns in which you used a card in your hands to "follow" other players - but there is a limit of 2 cards you can "follow", since these, together with the 3 yourself will use, will count for all the 5 cards you had chosen), the round is over. For the next rounds you can always choose the same cards you did before (you don't have to cycle the cards in any way - you are always free to choose the ones you want). The cards do actions that involve acquiring resources and build things (even new glades, sand pits and ponds). Buildings demand some resources to be built (of course) and there are three types of them: the ones with one-time, immediate effects; the processing buildings (turning something into something else); and the ones that give points in the end of the game (for a great deal of different things).

You gather resources, mainly to be able to do two things: turning them into bricks or glass - each player has another board, with two wheels, one to make bricks, other to make glass. When the wheel spins (because you had advanced all the basic resources types), it signifies that you had turned the basic resouces (like sand, water, clay, and others) into bricks or glass - is a learning experience in how difficult is to make these damn things! And, of course, the best buildings tend to require bricks and glass to be made, and as you can sense these resources are difficulty to have, since, for the wheel to turn, you have to have a clean spot in the wheel, meaning you have 1 or more of all the basic resources in that wheel (and, this means that you lose 1 or more of every basic resource).

So, the game goes like this - with you trying to pick cards that no one else will (because you will do both actions on it), and also trying to see which they will choose, for you be able to get one or two free actions. There are some timming balances to be made: the order in which you choose to activate the cards matters a lot. The buildings can help you do many things, and usually will provide you a north to follow through the game, so it is usually a good move to build or use the Landord (I guess it is his name) to reserve three buildings. Because almost (if not, in fact) everything in the game can be worth points, you just have to have the correct building to make this happen for one or other thing. So, at first, you have to use the buildings open to be built to trace some sort of strategy, or you won't know if you build more glades, or more pits, or ponds, or get a lot of clay, or charcoal, or glass, or, or, or, or...

The game proceeds for 4 rounds, and, in the end, the person with the most points wins.

[thing=143693][/thing] seemed, in a first play, as a fine game, reasonably fast (but not the 40 minutes promised, it is, indeed, more what says in the box: 20 minutes per player), and all the way through I felt like I was being sucked by quicksand from one of the pits. You have so few actions (it can be up to 32 actions, but can also be as low as 12) that I don't even had the feeling of actually accomplishing something. My board was really similar to what it was in the start - minus two forest areas, and plus a few glades and two buildings. Way less change than the one I saw in [thing=70149][/thing], which is [thing=143693][/thing] older brother, and in that you will definitely have a bunch of buildings and a completely different board as the one you had at the start. [thing=143693][/thing] seems brutally fast and tight!

The rules are fairly easy (only the use of the wheel required some examples to understand, but once it clicked, no further explaining was necessary), and all the 15 cards are simple to grasp what they do. The buildings demand more attention, since there are a lot of them (+90), and constantly new ones appear throughout the game. [thing=143693][/thing] also has a variant, in which the game last for 5 rounds instead of 4. This can be a good thing, in order for some strategies that require more time to take place - it sures changes the tempo of the whole game (and, of course, makes it longer). My view, as up to now, it that the overall experience will be better by playing 5 rounds.

So, to sum it up, [thing=143693][/thing] is a good game, but, pondering about my play, I put it behind [thing=70149][/thing], which is a more complex and long game, sure, but also better. ([thing=143693][/thing] also stays behind [thing=31260][/thing], but [thing=70149][/thing] is way closer in feel and some of the actions.) Of course, the main advantage of [thing=143693][/thing] is its greater acessibility, because of the shorter playing time and easy to learn rules.

"Feels" a little AP prone as there are a lot of paths to choose from but that AP is included in game time. The result is a game that feels like 2 hours but actually lasts 1 hour. Not sure if that feature is good or not, depends on players stress-liking factor. For me it was very good. The scarce resource feeling is ever present, not as desperate as in Agricola but still there. Overall a top eurogame with a lot of variety but it also has a lot of competition in its genre. It can beat a lot of its competition due to its high depth/playtime ratio.

RATING: 5
Glass Road feels like a hybrid of Witches Brew and Ora et Labora. What you end up with is a game that lasts only an hour but has over a dozen different resource types. It brings up the question of whether parsing the intricacies of this elaborate resource efficiency system is worth the effort, when the game play really isn't all that deep and your calculations may be undermined by the clever but chaotic role selection mechanic of Witches Brew.

Interesting.  Fast, easy to setup and play, but I need a few more plays to appreciate the richness I can sense lurking underneath.  Another good solo Rosenberg game.

This is another YASE with one new element (the dial) that makes it stand out.  One thing that makes the game weird is that the game sends you down some strange roads where you're working to make something, but that something doesn't necessarily do much to gain you points.  What you make is a means to an end, and the scores are fairly low (teens to mid-20s), meaning you might fail to grasp the point of what you're doing.  Strangely, this is a good summation of why current Euros fail to engage me like they used to.

Αρνητικο,οτι σε προιδεαζει το παιχνιδι να κατσεις να σκευτης κινησεις των αντιπαλων και γινεται πολυ over thinking.Οποτε τελικα κραταει πολυ...

Currently my favourite game to play in any situation. 

It's simple enough to teach people who otherwise only know about gateway games, and short enough for them to not be intimidated, but it's a beautiful strategic machine that will engage heavy euro gamers entirely. The most common remark I get from the latter group is "Wow, that was satisfying, but I didn't have to spend all night on it, and it felt really good to not have to feed everyone." Needless to say, in that last bit they were mainly comparing it to Agricola, also by Uwe. I think most people gloss over most of the games he's made, only going for the most popular ones. This gem is one reason you should dig deeper.

I will always make time for a game of Glass Road. I only have to make an hour, after all! Once the app's online multiplayer is working correctly, maybe ask to challenge me :)

It's so nice to see Uwe try something new. Yes, this is still a resource conversion game but the addition of programming and simultaneous role selection adds a ton of laughs to the equation. Don't get me wrong, this game is a serious brain burn. Yet instead of being stressful, as Uwe's games usually are, this one usually ends up being pretty lighthearted...assuming you don't get too mad when the table role blocks you over and over and over...

Seriously. I haven't seen this many smiles while playing a resource heavy Euro in a long time.

Now this game is an exception. It's a pointless cube pusher with no game at all. It's been stripped right back to the must basic of elements. Produce goods, buy more things to covert goods, gain points. Normally I hate this moronic stuff, but some how, somewhere in this game is a strangely enjoyable and rewarding experience.

RATING: 6
A pure resource conversion game with a clever concept of production wheels. Unfortunately it can cause a serious analysis paralysis - players have to make very precise calculations all the time as they are trying to coordinate many layers of the game (cards, tiles and resources). Glass Road is interesting and challenging and it's certainly a well-designed game, but it lacks that special something that would make me want to keep it in my collection.

RATING: N/A
Others seem to actually like the Witch's Brew mechanics as applied here. There I think it worked because there was some opportunity to guess what others were likely to have chosen. Here I feel it doesn't as well, because there are so many ways to do things that even knowing what someone wants to do it's a complete crap shoot guessing how they'll do it. I also really don't like the randomly appearing game changing buildings. Oh look, the one that triples my score and wins me the game just happened to come up on my last turn, wasn't that lucky.

A very enjoyable solo game.  The multi-player game plays smoothly, and adds a layer of heightened anticipation when playing the cards.  So, whether solo or multi-player, it's a great game.  The only drawback is that the theme does not shine through as brightly as some of his other games.  Nevertheless, it's a solid game and a "keeper"!

Bavarian glass makers. Player boards represent the clay works area.  A central board determines random tiles that provide production or scoring benefits.  Based on the starting upgrade tiles we select a sub set of specialist cards for each of four years.  The production wheels are a very clever tracking system for managing your brick and glass that FORCES conversion.  The evolution of gaming.  This game shows how rondels will replace the forest of wood cubes in a box.  The free action mechanic by anticipating the other players' card play is brilliant.  Intuitive game play that meshes with the theme.  This is a fast game but we still feel satisfied at the end.  Without a huge time commitment it is much easier to demand a re-match! The trick at the start is to figure out the best combination of tiles to invest.

Another iteration of what Rosenberg is doing lately.  I like it a bit better than Ora et Labora because I don't have to read tiny text from across the table and it's shorter.  It's still in the change this into that into victory points model that I'm not too fond of, but given the length, it's not bad.

Kurt R's comments on the game quoted in Larry Rice's comments on the game nail it.

This feels like Uwe's own version of Puerto Rico.
I'm not convinced yet, I mean, it's easier and quicker than PR so that's a nice option when you need something like that.

But it doesn't feel like a solid game for me yet. I want to try it more.

A fun simultaneous card selection game. Love the concept of first drafting your own mini hand but then actually having to play it in a specific order. The resource wheels are also very cool!

Solo review. The production wheel is a cool mechanic.  I like that you start with resources to harvest. Simultaneous action selection is one of my favorites.  Even purchasing buildings in this game feels like an accomplishment.  However, this game feels like it's over WAY too soon.  You get to buy 2-3 buildings, build a few ponds or pits and that's about it. I suspect this may be different / better when playing with more people, but I cannot recommend it as a solo game.

Keeping a typical Uwe Rosenberg-theme but not using worker placement but hand management as it's core mechanism. The card mechanism and the hand management really make this game shine. The cards all have two functions but, depending on which cards the other players use you might only get to use one of those. So you often are not fully able to do what you had in mind.
At the end of a game you always feel like you just needed one more round to get things going, so this really keeps you wanting to play this game again.

A great game that balances important decision making with a shorter but very enjoyable game!  This has a mix of action-selection, resource conversion, and tableau building all mixed into a brief but tense game.  An instant hit with the wife and me, and one that keeps drawing us back for more.

A new game from Uwe Rosenberg. A lot of people will stand up and cheer when they hear something like this. Not us. Why? Well, because we kind of have a hate-love relationship with this designer. He designed some great games, but other games he designed we don’t like. That’s why we always want to try a new game by this designer before we buy it. When we were invited to play Glass Road, we were not that enthusiastic. The game looks a lot like Agricola, and it’s no secret that we don’t like that game. But with Le Havre in the back of our minds, we decided to give it a go. The game was explained to us, and soon we were playing the first of four rounds. As most of the time, it will take a little while before you get into the mechanics of the game. Halfway the game, all of the players were thinking the same thing. It’s one of those Uwe’s again. Not a fun game. Not bad, but certainly not a good game.

But then something happened. We really got into the game and it’s nice mechanics. The game began to shine. After finishing the game, I wanted to play it again. This is not a heavy brainburner like Le Havre or Agricola, but it’s also not a family game. One minor thing about this game is that when you’re playing a four-player game with slow players you will suffer from a lot of downtime. In other words, this game needs the right group to play it. Best number of players for this game might be just 2 players.

I would've liked to play this more but my wife hated it so that was never going to happen. The resource wheels are an interesting, but also somewhat frustrating, puzzle to figure out. The small iconography was also a bit of a pain to read. Overall, the mix of card play and resource management, combined with a quick but still thinky game experience, was appealing and probably meant that I would've kept this around, at least for a little while. But on the other hand, I'm not sad to see it go either.

Takes the euro model in which one purchases buildings that give actions/windfalls/endgame points, then punches it up with an excellent simultaneous action selection mechanic. One of my top ten games.

RATING: 9
Brilliant.  The auto-manufacture of goods hearkens back to Roads & Boats - an absolute favorite - but the ingenious way in which the production wheels handle it makes even the ingenious wheel in Ora et Labora look clumsy.

Also, we finally have blind simultaneous action selection that doesn't completely suck.  In fact, it really, really works well.

I can't wait to play this more and more and experience the overload of buildings.

Que no sea de los grandes no tiene nada que ver con la calidad de la diversión que ofrece. No es un plato fuerte dirigido a saciar, colmar la glotonería propia para luego hacernos reposar y degustar una lenta digestión. Es más bien como una taza de té, mesurada, cuyo sabor es sorprendentemente intenso pero cuyo placer termina en cuatro pequeños sorbos, cuatro turnos llenos de decisiones, de tramar tu estrategia y engañar al contrario. 

La taza siempre termina demasiado pronto como para hacer todo lo que uno desearía, pero afortunadamente su corto placer invita a servirse de otra partida y a seguir disfrutando de este título que bien tiene cabida entre sus hermanos mayores, no como un sustituto o una cima que cubrir, sino por ofrecer justo por su naturaleza algo que los demás de más envergadura y renombre no pueden: la ligereza y la claridad de un juego sin abalorios, desnudo y auténtico.

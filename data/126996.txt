The production quality of the game is through the roof...amazing art, unnecessary tuckboxes!  The game itself is decent, but not great: worker placement to get more dice and benefits.  Good play length.  Lots of variation will make this play different every time.

Works decently well if you remove the terrible mechanics like the stealing card and the purple die.  Still, its too long for a dice game.  Luck can play a big role, as you essentially need 4 successful craft attempts to win, you can only do one a turn, and if you fail at one where you were expected to succeed you probably just lost all chance at winning the game.

That would be fine in a 15 minute game, imo, but this tends to take more than an hour.

I was initially enthralled by this game, but came to feel like it was longer and more fiddly that what I wanted in a game of this weight.

I enjoy the idea of it, but overall I just don't feel like it's probably for me.

This one is a misfit. Any time we can get a game that's full of dice we typically do so even if we know nothing about it. That's the case with King's Forge. The components are very good , including a 1st player token that must cost $5 to manufacture. Seriously! Don't believe us, look up the game. It's a plastic anvil that's bigger than most tactical mins in WH40K or the like.  It's a good theme. But the game is very wonky. There are different factions but no special abilities. Plus the rules are not very well written. Every time we have played it we've had to go to a video tutorial in order to refresh our memories because the rule book is pretty useless. Not so sure this one will hang around much longer. Definitely play it first before buying.

Forge is a great game. So far, I've been able to play it on three different occasions, each time with a different amount of players, and always a lot of fun. The first was a quick two-player game between me and my wife. I'm somewhat of a new gamer, and my wife is not a gamer at all, so it really speaks to the game's intuitiveness that we were both able to pick it up so quickly. The game has a lot of very clear iconography, so the rules did not need to be referenced except in rare cases; it's pretty apparent that the red Xs on gather cards means that the die is trashed, it's pretty apparent that the white squares on gather cards means that any die can be used, and there was never any confusion about what a gather card meant. The story was the same later when I played the game with two of my brothers, and later still when I played a four-player game. Everyone who played had different strategies that all worked equally well--Forge is surprisingly well balanced. 

The game is played in rounds, with each round consisting of three phases: the gather phase, the crafting phase, and the clean-up phase. The gather phase has players using their available dice to claim gather cards. These cards have various benefits, ranging from adding pips to the dice that would be rolled in the next phase, to acquiring extra dice. A few of these benefits are free, but most come at a cost. Some require the player to bench one or more dice for the remainder of the round, some require the player to trash one or more dice and return them to the supply. This leads to quite a few interesting and challenging decisions where players have to balance how many dice they want to use during the gather phase, versus how many they will need left over for the subsequent crafting phase.

Forge’s crafting phase allows players to roll whatever dice were not used in the gather phase and compete for crafter cards. Each crafter card has various dice pictured with a number of pips on each one. This number represents the minimum number a player must roll to claim the card. For example, if a card has three black dice on it, each showing four pips, then a player must roll at least three black dice that produce a four or higher to claim the crafter card. So if a player rolls two fours and a five, he/she can claim that crafter card. Over the rest of the round, other players can attempt to roll a higher combo and "steal" an already-claimed card, as well as try for cards that have not yet been claimed (there are three jobs available at any given time). 

Finally, the cleanup phase is just a quick set up for the next round. The gather cards are returned to the middle of the table, benched dice are returned to players' vaults, and trashed dice are returned to the dice pile. 

In all cases, the favorite gather cards were the Peddler, and the Astrologer. The Astrologer allows players to use whatever dice they happen to obtain during that gather phase for the subsequent crafting phase (normally, dice obtained during a gather phase are benched until the next gather phase). This card was always snatched up by a player as soon as it appeared. The Peddler allowed a player to either obtain a free black die, or steal any die the player wants from another player. The thievery comes with a hefty price tag (the user essentially trashes five dice to steal a single die), but if we're talking about blue dice, then the price is often worth it. The university die card was also very popular. The crafter cards were all very clever, with nods made to Monty Python & the Holy Grail, The Ledged of Zelda, and The Wizard of Oz. 

Now, here's one nit-picky thing, and I'm only including it because I feel like I have to be critical of something: It would be easier to set up Forge if all of the different card types had different backs. Currently, there are two different card backs in Forge: one for the crafter cards, and one for everything else. I think it would be a bit easier to set up if the crafter cards, gather cards, vault cards, black market cards, and even the player one card each had at least some slight variations on their backs so that things could be separated more easily. 

^^^ Note: I have since been told that this will indeed be changed for the better in the final version.

But other than that, Forge is a winner! The game has absolutely been added to our game night rotation. It's a blast to play, and I'm eagerly looking forward to the kickstarter campaign where I will happily contribute to obtain a copy with art that is even better than what I have here.

After my initial 2 play, Im impressed with what comes in this little package. Its very simple to learn, but offers a nice helping of game mechanics that make a really fun game. Its kind of like a puzzle with a nice twist on push your luck tied to resource management 

The artwork is pleasing to the eyes and easy to understand. The game plays out quick.

Great game!  I love dice if used correctly, and this game really pushes all the right buttons.  You can invest in a bunch of "tech" (new dice and temporary dice bumps) but if you spend all your dice investing, you won't have any left for buying.  You have to balance tech vs. a race to VP with the other players.  Queen's Jubilee is a MUST HAVE expansion too and made this game a 10 in my book.

Somewhat fun game, though I definitely don't see myself seeking to play it again. Would rather play Splendor, which I find similar and better. This game relies a bit too much on the 'higher is better' dice rolls that I don't care for. I like the dice manipulation and conversion cards. If it were a more about manipulating the pips and less about rolling high, I'd really love this game, as it is, I think it's only okay.

My husband wryly remarked that this is identical to about three other dice games we own, and although it's hard to disagree with him... I still like this one! There is something so satisfying about setting up your turn, gathering dice and special powers, and then pulling off a big move in the crafting phase. The artwork and presentation is superb, and it's just a fun, easy, light game to play.

I fell in love with the game because of the gorgeous art, well-executed theme, engaging Kickstarter, and basic gaming concepts. As I started getting into the game itself, it struck me as a very satisfying "in-between" game. 

King's Forge is a clever mix of action selection and resource management that creates an economic feel—even though it might look like a loose dice-chucking game at first. It actually wants to be both. In this way, it strikes me as a game that can create very mixed expectations—but for me, it's the Goldilocks of strategic dice games.  

The art is inviting and friendly and the promise of dice might make you think it's a light game, but to be successful you're carefully timing flexibility/growth vs taking a leap and trying to guarantee results.  It's both flexible and actually very tight. I feel it's in a similar weight class to the classic Stone Age, but it plays in under an hour. Turns are quick and there's a lot of decision density for what it is. This is right in my wheelhouse! 

It's an easier teach than it looks at first glance and you can learn by just doing. It seems to have an odd learning curve; (1) "There's more on the table than I expected for a dice game", (2) "oh, wait this is very easy," and (3) "now there's a whole human layer to keep track of and I'm satisfyingly saturated again."

I love it. Once you have all the expansions there's too much variability and you could get games that vary in length quite a bit based on just the population of items or Gather cards for that game. In that way, I think the game absolutely requires curating to insure an accessible experience (much like Alien Frontiers at this point).

*4* (Initial Plays)
Let me preface this with I just do not like heavy dice games. This game is heavy on luck and the play was very dull. Roll your dice and swap out dice for other dice to get treasures, which treasures can also be stolen. After one play of this I had seen enough. Also, for a game like this the play time was longer than I had hoped.

I love the variety of choices this game presents. Different gather cards and craft cards every game force you to consider different strategies. Finding the right balance of collecting the dice you need, hedging the odds of dice rolls with modifiers, and finding the right time to craft keeps the tension high as you try and outthink your opponents. At the end of the day it still comes down to rolling dice but I feel like there are enough ways to mitigate luck that it balances out. Besides, it's just so dang exciting to see how the dice fall. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Awesome game that's quick to learn, difficult to master. It's all about getting lots of dice! Or is it? There's a lot of risk vs. reward mechanics to this; sometimes the dice will roll your way, sometimes they won't, but playing smart will typically overshadow the capriciousness of lady luck.

No I will not pay you 40 dollars for that. You won't even sell it through the retailer I prefer Timewellspentgames? Why don't you take your game and.....go sell it to people that are not me. 

You lost me as a customer and engendered more ill will in me towards Game Salute. I am contemplating a new and fresh boycott of games published by them particularly by first time American game designers

I will give you this. Your art looks good and your game looks fun. I thought it failed my art test but i looked at all of the pictures shown on bgg and I cannot find a dark and nasty illustration anywhere. I must have remembered wrong. I must have marked do not buy this because it was a Game Salute game. That would be a valid reason.

RATING: 9
Played 2x
Use dice as workers in a worker placement phase to gain more dice for future turns or gain dice value modifiers to help with the current turn. Then use your leftover dice (plus any modifiers) to hopefully roll high enough to craft items. Repeat.

It's easy to understand the rules and teach the game. I like the trade offs between building now and improving your dice pool for the future. The components and art are very nice as well. There is a ton of replayability because the worker placement spots can potentially change every game (3,432 different combinations!). Plus you get to roll a LOT of dice. 

I like the high degree of interaction. There's passive interaction through blocking worker placement spots that others need. There's also active interaction through stealing victory points by rolling better than your opponents. Even though there's a lot of strategy involved, there is a lot of luck involved too: the worker placement spots come out in a random order each round and it's hard to count on an ability being there when you need it, even if other players aren't actively blocking you. 

The only problem I have with the game is that turn order seems to be incredibly important in this game but, oddly enough, there doesn't seem to be a way to control it. Maybe there is in one of the expansions. Most of the time, you want to go early in the worker placement phase, so you can pass earlier and get the pass bonus. Sometimes you want to go early in the craft phase because you can sweep up all the easy to craft items and players going later need to match your dice values or better. But sometimes you want to go later in the craft phase so you can steal items from other players. 

I think some house rules could fix this...maybe a gather card that allows a player to pick a new first player, effective during the craft phase of the same round. But make it so that this gather card can't be among the four face up at the beginning of the round. Or first player token goes to the person with the least amount of dice in their dice pool.

King's Forge is a nice dice chucker.
There are enough action cards to have good variety, but few enough to learn them quickly.  So game play moves along at a good pace.  It also keeps players engaged well in other players turns with the possibility of stealing cards from other players.
I like how the game seems to keep players from getting all the same special dice.  In a lot of games players all end up getting the same bonus dice, which limits the fun.
Solid game.  Worth a play or buy.

Played with 5 players so must of had the expansion going.  Fairly enjoyable but realize there is a lot of luck going on with some critical die rolls.  Also there are a few screwage cards where you can get really hosed right when you can least afford it. If an player can get an early lead on cards, it will be difficult to catch him.  My play I got a card turn 1, but another player rolled really well and was able to get a card plus snag mine.  So instead of me being -1 to him, I was -2...none of us could catch up...from turn 1.  One player could never roll well enough to get any cards!  Still, I would mind playing it again to see if it will grow on me.

RATING: 9
[b]King's Forge[/b] is a really smart design in one of my favorite genres: the Strategic Dice Game.  

[b]KF[/b] feels like the child spawned by the mating of [b]To Court the King[/b] and a fairly attractive and spunky resource-building Eurogame.  

The game has two main phases: The Gather Phase where you build up your resource pool, your resources being dice, and the Craft Phase where you roll those babies to try to Craft Items.

The game has a number of clever design choices that come together very well:

* You've got two main categories of things you can do during the Gather Phase: 1) Collect more/upgrade your dice and 2) Acquire tools to let you manipulate your dice when you roll them in Craft Phase.  Balancing these two imperatives is very interesting, and has elements of strategy, tactics, and good-ol'-push-your-luck.
 
* The 11 Gather Cards used each game come from a larger deck of roughly double that size, so each game you will need to figure out different ways to build and manipulate your dice pool.

* The Craft cards you will use also come from a much larger deck, and these are presented in order of difficulty, providing a nice escalation over the course of the game.

* The requirements of all the current and upcoming Craft Cards are visible from the beginning of the game, allowing some nice strategizing as to how you should build your dice pool both for the short and long term.  You need to make some interesting choices between going for the quick cheap grabs, or spending time upgrading your resources so you'll be better prepared for the more elaborate items when they show up.  

* The optimal strategy is going to vary based on the cards that come up, the player count, and what the other players are doing, giving nice variety to each game, a feature I love.  A few cards, such as the peddler and graveyard, add some player interaction, as does Craft card stealing.  You also need to decide whether you are going to rely on luck and charge ahead, or go slower with more tools to let you mitigate the luck of the dice.

* [thing=147420][b]The Queen's Jubilee[/b][/thing] is a rare expansion that actually speeds up and simplifies the  strategy somewhat,  allowing you to use KF as a super-filler, and perhaps more easily engaging more casual gamers who want to get down to the dice rolling.

* The game board is available as an add-on.  It is, as advertised, completely unnecessary, but also very nice, giving you finely illustrated places to put all the cards and dice (helping you remember what they represent), and also replacing the dock cards with board spaces.  The board also accommodates the Queen's Jubilee expansion.

Overall, [b]KF[/b] is a really fine game, and there is potential for my rating to climb even higher than my current 8 with more plays.  It hits a nice spot on the complexity curve, where you can get by with minimal thought, but the game will also reward deeper thinking.  It also hits a nice vibe for families on the interaction curve, where you need to be aware of what other people are doing and compete in the craft phase, but there is not too much directly messing with each other.  

My kids, 6 and 8, enjoy KF quite a bit, and I will be turning the blank Craft Cards over to them so they can design their own Craft items, making the game truly our own.

I hope the Game Salute limited distribution doesn't dampen enthusiasm and exposure for this game too much.  It's a great production and deserves a lot of attention.

I was strangely excited when I saw the butt load of dice for this game.  Sadly, though, my first impression is that there is way too much luck in King's Forge, and that it involves a dumb theme hammered onto a boring dice mechanic. Adding more card types might have made this better, or perhaps owning some of the cards that you use? Meh...

This is pretty easy to learn, fast to play and light. The art is great. The evil dolphin is disturbing. 

The drafting part of the turn is good, I like the way it works without being terribly annoying or long. Its a little disappointing that you have to go to the forge portion without knowing if you can actually make anything, since you roll after you have to commit. 

The game plays in a very reasonable time period for as light as it ends up.

Kocka, kocka és még több kocka. Gyönyörű kivitelezés. Nagyon tetszik az ötlet, hogy a kockákat az első fázisban munkásként használjuk, értéktől függetlenül, majd a megmaradtakkal kovácsolunk. Jól ki van találva a különböző színű kockák gyűjtésének ritmusa, lehet más-más taktikával játszani. Nagyszerű, hogy minden játékban egész más akciólehetőségek van. Viszont a szerencse szerepe fájdalmasan nagy. Jó lett volna valamit kitalálni arra, hogy a kicsi dobások is hasznosíthatóak legyenek. Ettől függetlenül szórakoztató darab.

On the Kickstarter page, they request you go onto the BBG website and leave positive comments as "An easy way for you to help grow the King's Forge community". Then, in the same comment, they point out the errors in the game, and state these get fixed in the 2nd Edition, with no upgrade option for KS owners (except I guess to buy the 2nd edition). So, consider me part of a pissed off with customer service community.

Has 'Kickstarter' written all over it. A pointless attempt to do Dominion with dice. You start with basic black dice, then upgrade them using action cards in an attempt to have the right combinations to buy an item. First to four items wins. Trouble is, you can set yourself up with the right dice and then roll poorly which means you either don't get an item or it gets stolen. As long as gamers continue to back pap like this, that's the type of game we'll continue to get.

Tom Vassel has a good review on this and a agree with a lot of what he has to say.  The dice are only rolled once per round and the effects of randomness are big.  Ways to mitigate randomness are limited and too expensive.  So in the end the game is fluky, combined with a length that's too long for comfort.  Proceedings of play are extremely repetitive and procedural with player choices being generally obvious and of limited significance/scope.  The game is beautifully produced and all the dice are nice but components aren't enough to justify getting this.  This is a clear pass for me.

Ratings and comments based on a single play - so take that for what it's worth.  Looks great, wonderful art, great components, iconography clear.  I really like the game design and concept.  It was fun to play.  I just felt (in my one game) That some players just had no good options some turns.  No matter what they did they were screwed and couldn't acquire a card that round.  Only 4 total cards are required for victory, so having a couple rounds where you just couldn't get something seals your doom.  Maybe I just need to play it more, but that's my initial impression.  As I said, it looks great, and the variability from game to game seems awesome.

RATING: 7
A surprise hit for me. I was put off by the box because it seemed very thematic, but it's basically an abstract dice management/placement game.

Some will be turned off by the luck factor, but I really think the game is about probability and risk management. You have to figure out which victory cards your opponents are trying to win and either beat them to the punch (by rolling for it a round before they do or having better odds heading into the roll, either by having more dice or better modifiers) or go for a less contested card while hindering their progress (by blocking a gather card they need or playing a hurting gather card like the cemetery).

The most interesting aspect is using the current game state to assess how to balance your dice between gathering and crafting. If I am well behind, I will go for broke trying to craft early, whereas if I am ahead I may pace myself to ensure I get the last card I need.

Rating could be higher, but I would like to play more to see if the gather cards are balanced.

Really interesting game. Build your pool of dice, of which there are four kinds (Metal, Wood, Gems and Magic), to forge items for the King.

Two phases in the game add to the depth. spend your dice in the action phase, or save them for more chances to craft items in the crafting phase.

Light enough to teach and learn to non gamers, but enough depth to keep most gamers interested. Good overall game!

King's Forge is a dice management game where the players are trying to gather new dice and sacrifice others to gain dice of rarer quality. Thematically the die represent various resources such as metals, gems, magic, wood and the like. 

The players are in a race to forge 4 or 5 items of quality in order to impress the king. The players can take advantage of various powers on Gather Cards each round and then have a chance to roll their dice in order to forge these items. 

The catch is that dice used to gather cannot also be used to craft in the same round, so the players have to weigh up their options carefully. 

There is nothing wow about any one aspect of King's Forge but the combination of its mechanisms and mechanics are enough to offer a really good time, with some good player interaction thrown in as well. 

It's a keeper for me and I will be keen to see if any of the expansions can lift it a notch or two.

RATING: 7
"Very solid, clever dice-building game, which I like way better than Quarriors. A bit of stealing was a bit much for my delicate sensibilities, but I highly recommend the game to people with normal tolerances for interaction."

Comments based on the Oct 2012 prototype from TGC.

What I like:
- Clever "dice-building" mechanism, done far better than Quarriors
- Interesting decisions (primarily immediate gain vs. long-term strength)
- Only using a subset of gather and craft cards each game really helps replayability
- There is actually quite a bit of depth here (although it is tempered by the randomness of the card drafting and dice rolling)
- There is a surprising amount of player interaction, although it is mostly predicting and responding
- Buckets of dice

What I don't like:
- The card effects seem a bit daunting at first
- A bit stronger theme would be nice
- I really dislike the Cemetery and Peddler cards (they directly mess with other players)
- Length can vary depending on the craft cards in the game (30 to 90 minutes)
- I prefer "game ends; add up your points" rather than "first player to X wins".
- I wish it supported 5p (supposedly the expansion will)

I agree with the BGG weight of 2.3. It's pretty easy to teach, although it's going to take most people at least a game or two to learn enough about the cards to see the combos, and to get a sense of the rhythm of the game to know when to gather and when to craft.

You can steal crafted items, but it doesn't feel nasty. You try to craft the best items you can, and if that means you did better than the other person, you get the item. There are a couple slightly nasty gather cards, but nothing too severe.

RATING: 1
A game with loads and loads of dice that you almost never roll. So that leaves the card drafting.  I found this to be interesting for maybe 5 or 10 minutes.  The problem is you see the same 11 cards every round and by round three, it gets incredibly dull due to the fact the cards are not that interesting in the first place (trade this color die for that color die...yawn).  Not fun.

  I was considering a rating of maybe a 3, but with all of the BS shill accounts giving this a 10, it's easily a 1.

Normally I'm not a dice-builder fan, however I thought this version was well done, implemented dice rolling correctly, and didn't have run-away leader issues.  I like how the treasures and power cards are variable and guarantees different games.  I like the competition for spots and risking whether one can claim a treasure.

It would be higher, however I'm not the biggest dice-builder fan.  There were some clunky rules about where dice used/aquired went.

Surprisingly non-engaging. The theme is interesting, and the dice buying mechanics are fairly well realized, but the game itself feels strangely dull.

Gets better each time I play it. A clever, fast, take-that, dice-manipulation game. Tons of replay value, especially with the Queen's Jubilee expansion. There's a chance games will devolve into an attack-the-leader/king-maker fest. Stealing will always be better than forging new items, which makes being first player suck. Make sure to find players who can roll with the punches.

There is certainly luck when it comes time to roll dice for forging, but that luck has (a) many opportunities to be mitigated, and (b) is spread out over many turns.  So, it felt a lot less random than it looked, and I think it's reasonably low on pure luck.  And I do like the jockying for position over the action card draft and planning ahead to have a good shot at forging items that will be coming out in a few turns.

Stealing stuff from other players is indeed random and frustrating, but it doesn't seem to happen that often and can sometimes be predicted.  So, it doesn't bug me as much as I thought it would.  In general, I feel I shouldn't like the game, but find it charming.

The mechanics of this game sounded really fun, as I enjoy strategic dice games.  While building a little engine is certainly possible, buying the items felt pretty restrictive and more luck based than I'd have hoped.

This game uses dice cleverly but still lets them be dice.  There are lots of options for mitigation of luck.  This game is much tighter and more thinky than I thought it would be.

I enjoyed that the game mechanics are compact and still allow for a good variety of strategies and outcomes. Didn't like the coloring, which could be more logical. (Played this two months ago, so I'm relying on my memory now.)

I am really impressed with this game. 

The artwork is a perfect 10 (in the 7 Wonders, Eminent Domain strata for me). The gameplay is innovative, dynamic, competitive, yet intuitive (though the iconography is a bit more abstract). With all of the variable craft and gather cards, this game has near infinite replay-ability (especially considering the 8 blank cards that enable me to create my own craft cards). 

As a Kickstarter, this game has blown me away. The only bad thing I can say about this game is that it was delayed, but there is no negative impact on anyone buying this retail.

I will not turn down a chance to play this game!

A pretty good game that unfortunately lacks punch. While there are a lot of dice in this game, you rarely roll them. Most of the game revolves around card drafting to accumulate abilities to help with your one roll of the round. This game is a victim of needing space for better games.

Simple, easy to teach and fun. Dice based game that not 100% luck. It plays in about 60 minutes, so I think that this one will see some time on the table.

Original score (1/15) : 7.9
New score (1/16) : 7.1

Still interesting, but there's a lot of really good games out there, and this one is just "good"

RATING: 7.5
I found that I enjoyed this more than I might have otherwise. It seems pretty simple on the surface, just roll your dice and then place them to get more dice. But the interesting paths are which dice you accumulate over time, and additionally, the cards that you pick up also influence your ability for which dice you can use and how effective they are. You've also got this race element out there and having to set aside some dice to stop improving your dice engine but actually score points that also adds for some good tension. Overall, a really solid dice building game.

1 play, 4er

Got home early, but they were busy putting inserts together for a few games (for HOURS!). After, we had to organize and pack all the games we’re bringing ... took a long time! But we did manage to squeeze this game in.

It's a dice game where you use dice to get more/better dice and/or items which give you dice manipulation powers. Kind of like To Court the King, but the extra power items come out in random order (and you only play with a random subset of them, I think). Also, you can take stuff from other players so turn order (going later) is a big deal! Also, you roll only once per round and you retain the dice (those you don't spend) from turn to turn, so you can gradually build towards the big VP items. 

It's OK, but I'd rather play other similar games.

For an alleged dice rolling game, you don't roll the dice a lot. It is more of a worker placement game in which your dice act as your workers and occasionally you get to roll them.

Quick, light, fun dice collecting and rolling game.

The theme is completely pasted on. Totally tactical, virtually no strategic decisions possible, and a fairly heavy dose of luck. If you want this done a bit longer with some strategy, try Airships.

That said, I enjoyed playing it.

I think they're might be something here, but unfortunately it's impossible for me to tell.  The red and green dice on the cards is much to difficult to distinguish for my color blindness and I can't tell the black and green dice apart. I needed help the entire game with my dice and had no idea what other players had.

This is a game that had popped up on my radar simply because the designer does some Go teaching videos I watch. I knew absolutely nothing about the game but was curious to give it a try.

The game is very visually appealing. The artwork is great and there are a ton of dice. There's also a massive anvil start player marker that seems much larger than it needed to be.

In the game you start with a bunch of black dice. You use your dice, either by exhausting them for the round or permanently losing them, to buy other dice. The next step up in dice are the green dice, and then the red, followed by the rarest, the blue. It's progressively harder to get the green, red and blue.

You buy new dice by taking one of the cards that come out every round and committing the appropriate dice to the card, or by trashing the card and triggering one of the dock locations, which require you to lose dice. Some of the cards give you special abilities for the round instead of dice. Cards are replaced until the deck runs out.

When all the cards are gone the crafting phase begins. You roll all the dice you didn't commit to other actions. There are three items currently available to "craft" on your turn, and anything you craft is replaced by the next item in the waiting queue. Crafting an item is simply a matter of spending the matching color dice with pip values equaling or surpassing what's shown on the item. There are some ways to improve your die rolls so that you're not totally hosed by random luck. The first person to craft four items wins.

The premise of the game is fairly simple. Most of the early items require primarily black and green dice, then the price of crafting starts ramping up and requires red dice. The later items require blue dice. It seemed to me that the secret to winning was to get items as early as you could, while they were still cheap, and buying the dice you needed to get those early items. I bought a lot of green dice but only one red and no blue. So I was stuck trying to get all my items early as I had no potential to get the later cards. That worked out, but mostly because I got lucky.

So what do I think of the game? Well... I like the idea of buying dice with other dice and using them to craft the items... but the actual game fell short of the promise for me. This is a game that doesn't easily fit in the short filler category or the longer strategy game category, but straddles both uncomfortably. If the game was short and quick it would have worked well, but the game actually went on for quite a while. It didn't work as a longer strategy game for me as there's a good bit of randomness in the game.

In particular, and most notably, you're rolling a bunch of dice. And while there's ways to adjust your die rolls and mitigate that randomness, it still bit a couple of players in the butt. Secondly, there's randomness in the way that the cards come out every round. It starts with four cards being available and when one is used another replaces it until the deck runs out. Some of those cards aren't terribly useful most of the time while some are very important. The card to use the dice you purchased during the round (which usually aren't available until the following round) in particular can be crucial.

The game length to randomness ratio just doesn't work for me. This was particularly driven home on one turn when a player crafted an item using dice that were mostly 6's but another player was able to steal the item away from him with a perfect roll. In a quick game that'd be okay, but after building up our positions and investing a lot of time in getting the right color dice, it just seemed inappropriate.

This simple but attractive dice crafting game offers almost infinite replayability. In each game, all players choose from a pool consisting of 11 action cards (called 'Craft cards'). The base game alone contains 32 Craft cards, so playing with different card combos allows a range of different strategies and possibilities. The expansions add more Craft cards to the mix, as well as more types of dice. Did I mention that the components for the game are nothing short of stellar? Awesomeness in a box.

Kind of the definition of a 6 rating to me. The artwork is good and the mechanics are pretty decent but everything combines to a meh experience. I'd certainly play it again if someone in my group wanted to but if given the choice, I'd check out a new game or turn to a trusted favorite.

An interesting progress-your-dice-pool game that hearkens back to [thing=21632][/thing], but with different colors of dice to be used as building materials.  The net effect is pretty fun, and the extra cards included enhance the replay value; however, it does suffer from the classic dice game flaw:  Rolling higher is always better, with little to mitigate that.  The game does [potentially] give you a convert-ones-to-sixes ability, but that just means that you'll roll all twos, and once you know the game, your chronically bad rollers know to hoard dice of any type so they can be destroyed to create the ones they need; however, sooner or later, you still have to roll well, and — more importantly — better than your opponents.  Even with a handful of die tweaking abilities at your fingertips, this may just not happen for you.

I like it, I'd play it, and if you love dice games, I think you'll dig this.

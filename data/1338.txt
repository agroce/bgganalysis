Not as 'complete' as the next evolution in the series (Age of Steam) but if anything this can be a bit more of a brain burner and plays faster. Seems to scale well from 2-6 but a different approach required for each

Quick and tension filled. It's a "gamer's game" and not a social game.  I favor it over Age of Steam because it's quicker with similar difficult economics but is overall more forgiving. Plus, I like the goods growth mechanism better than the one in AoS and there's Action cards to help the less fortunate players.

Age of Steams little brother. A little easier than big brother and that sometimes is a good thing. Age of Steam is one of those games that is great but I wouldn't want to play it all the time due to it being a heavier game. Volldampf on the other hand has most of the good stuff but I could still play it if I had a headache or after a long, draining day at work.

In comparing this to it's Big Brother, Age of Steam, I prefer the simpler gameplay here.  Yes, it can still be pretty punishing if you don't plan well, but there are fewer things to worry about, which I think makes the game more fun to play than AoS.  After several enjoyable sessions, it's moved to my "want" list.

If you like Age of Steam and Railroad Tycoon, it's unpossible to dislike this game. You could discribe it as a sort of short version of the two games above. Although it has almost the same elements, it is a different game. Because of the way the tracks are laid, you have to cooperate more (willingly or not). So by laying your tracks very strategic, you can take a maximum profit of other players deliveries. The bonus for the worst player is a good idea.

This game handsomely illustrates the point that just because a game grows up into a more mature title (Age of Steam), it doesn't mean that the earlier versions suddenly have become obsolete. On balance, it is probably largely due to the fast playing time that it is saved from becoming an object of interest purely for those who like to explore the family tree of a modern classic. However, when you haven't got the time or energy to invest into a thoughtful game of Age of Steam, it's great to have an alternative that poses roughly the same challenges, but packs it in a lighter and faster game. It is equally true that, here, winning also requires a bit more luck, and that any picked strategy will only work if the randomly drawn cubes appear in the right places on the predefined network. But this is much easier to forgive in a game that cuts playing time in half and still offers nice and dense game play.

When it dawns on you how few turns there are, it's only a small step towards realising that maxing out your potential is crucial in each turn. And that you cannot afford to let the leader benefit too much from the actions of the others. It helps to play in a group where players are capable to avoid king making issues by making roughly equally competent moves.

On the whole players always require a bit of good fortune in transport games with the seeding randomly drawn cubes, but the scarcity of shipping turns in this game puts a premium on well-placed cubes.

Most of the decision making takes place up to the moment you pick up the track cards after each auctions. From then on it can be a bit "spotting the right move", but there seem to be enough decent alternatives to keep the game very interesting even if people don't max out completely, be it by their own hand, of that of Fate.

However, with precious little turns to make your 'mark' it is no wonder that Wallace was forced to come up with the only mechanic that would allow a trailing player to catch up fast: action cards that favour the strugglers. When a lot of people comment on how close the final results are, it stands to reason that the apparently overly-powerful cards amongst them are in reality finely balanced, and serve their purpose well. It might work in game terms, but it does raise the question if someone who borrows wisely, makes great placement decisions and ships goods with maximum impact deserves to be run close by someone who was otherwise outplayed, but who also, as a direct result of being last, can be empowered by some potentially phenomenally high-scoring action cards.

I'm not sure if I prefer this game with 4 or 5, but either one of those seems to be preferable over any other amount, and require their own approach. On the whole I tend to avoid games with 5 because of downtime issues, and downtime is one of the problems I have with Age of Steam, but here it was no issue to me.

If players had a little more control over network creation, and with it, the ability to concoct long(er) term strategies, maybe that would be my Wallace railroad sweet spot. Right now it depends on what mood I am in which of the 2 (Age of Steam or Volldampf) I would go for. And for that reason alone it's nice to have the option, although it must be said that Volldampf is only a candidate if Age of Steam isn't, rather than vice-versa. But it would be a shame if this game gets forgotten simply because of standing in the shadow of a bigger and better known brother. It's too decent by half for that.

RATING: 4
The focus here is on very difficult tracks - rather than the very difficult money-handling of Age of Steam (and a lesser-but-still-tight track there).  Really interesting to see the players' building incentives, and how it changes when a player does something unexpected.

I have doubts about the random cards.  Upon further reflection, this has dropped in interest significantly for me.  I'd love to play again, verify.

This is my favorite Wallace train game. It plays fast, has a nice German mapboard, and is less of a brainburner than Age of Steam. I believe 4 players maybe it's magic number, but will play this with any number willing to play! This is a great game!! "If it's not Wallace it's Crap!"

I played this twice in one day -- once with five players and once with six.  I couldn't say whether or not there is a lot of strategy and control in the game or if it is just the luck of the track cards and commodities.  It could end up being anywhere from a '5' to an '8' rating in the future, but I would play it again right now if someone asked.

The best of Martin Wallace, but still not great. Interesting ideas, but a limited number of ways to approach the game, not much strategic planning, and I just find the game very boring. It doesn't really engage at any level, either thematically or intellectually (due to the lack of any ability to do long-term planning), and there is a lot of "sit around and wait for your turn". Of the Martin Wallace games, Way Out West and Empires where more fun, but this is a more functional game. Still not one I'd personally recommend,  but it will certainly appeal to some.

Another solid euro style railroad game.  Players connect cities and ship to score points.  Volldampf is a little more involved and requires some planning when compared to a lot of railroad games of the euro style genre.  Borrowing to build track is necessary and interest comes due regularly.  All in all, a good, fun game to play.

Excellent game, based on the Martin Wallace/Winsome Lancashire Railways/New England Railways series. A lot of the complexity has been stripped down for this new, attractive, edition set in 19th century Germany.

RATING: 4
On the one hand, it is a great train game a la 'Age of Steam' but in a friendlier, leaner, simpler, shorter plackage. On the other hand, everthing comes together so rapidly in the mid-game that non-optimal play will create winners and losers early. I tend to dislike games that focus on seeing the "correct move", such as this or Elfenland, Alexandros, etc. I doubt that I will play this one often since the release of Schacht's Hansa, a very clever delivery game with better constraints and more intersting decisions. Or try Power Grid for a less bloodthirsty but wonderfully complex economic building game.

Played 1 time. The graphics bothered me quite a bit as the colors of the cities, commodities, and players tracks, all started to swim in my head. Some differentiation would have helped a lot. As it stands, the game reminds me of another Wallace game, Way Out West: Neat mechanisms, but so balances out too well, making every game so close and balanced, I feel a bit disappointed. Want very much to try again though.

3 Plays.  it's an excellent mid-weight substitute for Age of Steam.  It replaces track building with card pattern matching, and has bonus cards that handicap the game for weaker rail barons.
4 players is ideal.  Not worth bothering with 2 players.

There are obvious similarities to Age of Steam, with a little less strategic thinking (for example where to lay track; the track is already there).  I personally prefer AoS, but this is an excellent lighter alternative.

RATING: 6
Volldampf is an intermediary step between Wallace's Lancashire Railways and Age of Steam. Instead of fixed routes like in Lancashire or completely free-form building like in AoS players here select sets of rail cards that each allow building any route in a certain area on the board. Shipping works pretty much the same, except there is no engine level, and goods can always be moved up to six links. This makes the game quite a bit less cut-throat although there are certainly still ways to turn other players in.

Volldampf also introduces action cards that provide benefits to the player in last place and to those who do not want to or cannot move goods on their turn. The effects of those cards vary wildly in terms of usefulness and aggravation potential and feel somewhat out of place in a game that is pretty much built on open information otherwise.

I'm not sure which game I will end up liking more.

RATING: 6
Volldampf is a good game with one very big problem: it's not nearly as good as Age of Steam.  Both are members of a family of Martin Wallace games that began with the Winsome games Lancashire Railways and New England Railways.  Volldampf was the next chronologically, followed by Age of Steam, and later Australian Railways and Railroad Tycoon.  All of these games use the same basic game idea, but each develops the idea in a different way.

One of Volldampf's distinguishing features is the way it handles construction of track.  Unbuilt track segments ("links") are drawn on the board, grouped by color.  In an order determined by auction, players each draft a pair of cards allowing them to build something like "a pink and a blue link" or "two green links."  In Lancashire Railways and New England Railways, individual auctions were held for specific links.  In Age of Steam, players build track in any open area of the board.  In Volldampf, you can see the evolution from the very structured track building of the earlier games to the more freeform track building of Age of Steam.  But in this case, I think Volldampf is the awkward middle child.  The move toward greater freedom in track building drains life from the auction.  (Age of Steam, despite its even greater freedom of building, revives the auction by introducing special powers which are selected in turn order.)

I'm also not a fan of Volldampf's special action cards.  They're imbalanced in power, and some of them are used to hose one other player.  These sort of "surprise!" cards work very well in some games, but Volldampf is not the right game for them.  Again, we see an intermediate step in the evolution of Age of Steam, where the special abilities ultimately became roles that were selected each turn (locomotive, urbanization, engineer, etc.).

I traded my copy of Volldampf as soon as Age of Steam came out.  If I still owned it, Volldampf would occasionally hit the table when we had six players.  It handles that number very well, better than Age of Steam does - better than most games, in fact.

So I'll give Volldampf a qualified recommendation for those who think Age of Steam is a little too intense, or for those who expect to play often with six players.

This one was pretty good.  I was taken aback at the end of the game when a player leapt out ahead with a clever use of cards.  I have to balance the "ha-ha!" factor with the really cool mechanism of tracks only can be built in certain areas dictated by the cards.  I like that.

RATING: 7.5
Lighter, more random and more forgiving than Age of Steam and different enough to require a different strategy.  Need to play more often.  Works better with 3 or 4 players.  I'm not sure the catch up mechanism works.

The random cubes are assigned to cities each turn via a deck of cards. The lines are marked with symbols. Each turn sets of cards from another deck define which symbols can be built on this turn.  The players bid for turn order and then in turn order choose a set of build cards.  Then there are 2 or 3 rounds of track building followed by 2 rounds of goods movement (up to 6 track segments per move). You can take cards from a third deck if you choose not to move a good or if you are trailing on the income track.  These cards give you one-off advantages and are a form of catch up mechanism.

The goods movement, income track and "bonds" are the same as Age of Steam (except there is no bond limit).

The precursor to Age of Steam - check
The precursor to Railroad Tycoon - check
A little shorter than AOS - check
A little less Grueling than AOS  - check
A little bit lighter than AOS - check
About the same weight as RRT - check
On par or better than AOS or RRT......

Well most of you know the answer even if you haven't played all three but here are some things I noticed other than above:

 - We had serious AP problems in this game and not in a deep kind of way but rather pure analysis and calculation as there seemed to be TOO MANY options for placement and movement, I don't remember this in either big brother although AOS has its own very necessary  engrossing analysis as well but for other reasons. 

 - There were a couple rule issues we had but nothing major

 - There were a couple of cards that were maybe too good like RRT and the catch up mechanism might work a little too good as well although it does make for close games.

 - Quite  a dose of luck in the cards and where the goods come out, more than AOS but pretty much on par with RRT.

Bottom line is all 3 are good and choosing depends on your tastes. I think RRT has the least amount of AP and is forgiving enough to be welcomed by most therefore hitting the table the most. It does need a couple of tweaks though IMHO.

Why weren't the same mechanics used in Age of Steam?!?  The random events would have made AoS a much better design.  Mr. Wallace trimmed the wrong stuff and added too much... I'll take this game over the bloated AoS any day of the week!

The precursor to Age of Steam. This game has some random elements involved such as what track routes are available to be built in a current round. There are also special cards that one can get for being in last place or that can be taken in place of moving goods. As a result you get a very good pick up and deliver game that has quite a different feel than Age of Steam.    
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game feels and plays like the final dress rehearsal for Age of Steam, which I think was published a year later. More fun and strategic than the Winsome Early Railway series, you can see how Wallace was searching his way towards more open selection in track building without quite getting to the track tile concept yet. Here, sections of the board are segmented and you bid for a hand of 3 randomly drawn sections on which you can build for the turn. The value of the draws depends on where you have previously built and whether or not the available sections are adjacent. 

Action cards are used as a catch-up mechanic and feel largely unecessary. Easy to see why they did not make it into AoS. However, the bonds, auctions, the importance of turn order for track building - the basic AoS ingredients are here and bidding and building actions in this one are quite fun.

A very good midweight train game - perhaps you could say between the beginner and advanced versions of Steam.

RATING: 7
When you go through the rules you think that the game is just like a simplified version of Age of Steam, but when playing you find that it is quite different.  The increased amount of track builds and the semi-random nature of your track-building possibilities (and the fact that the track is already on the board) means that it is very difficult to develop your own network.  You instead must utilize your opponents' track quite a bit more.  The game ends up being an exercise in how to least benefit your opponents, especially the ones in the lead.  I can see how there may be a slight kingmaking problem in the end shipping rounds.  Usually in Age of Steam, you rarely ship on someone else's track, so it's not as big of a deal as it is here.  The cards also seem potentially unbalancing, though I suppose they may be needed if someone is behind and needs to catch up.  I like the quick play time and lighter feel of the game.  It is a worthy companion to Age of Steam, which seems to be a little too heavy and time consuming for me to get to the table as often as I'd like.

Essentially Age of Steam-lite. As such, an OK pick-up-and-deliver train game, but overclassed by its successor Age of Steam. Lighter, quicker and only tactical as there is not much possibility for long-term planning. I like the implementation of the goods growth, but detest the "chance" cards.

Fast playing medium weight train game that offers plenty to think about throughout the game.

If somebody reprints this with better components they have a hit game in their hands.

It's the best train game I have played so far. Its not perfect, there is a few things that bugs me but it's OK. First I think I can break the game by taking all the shares right at the beginning of the game. OK, I won't win because each share is worth -1 point, but I'll be the only one to have money. Since the game only last 4 turns, you only need to refund 4 of the 6$ you get from each share. So by thinking about it, you just spend 2$ of the 6$ per share and you won't get bankrupt. If the game would last longer, that would be different, you must make enough money each turn to pay your depts.

Another thing is that the game is too short. It's like if weere playing the early development of the game and that's it, it stops. I would love the game to go faster by replacing the bidding mechanics for the cards and allow to play more rounds according to the number of player. Also Making sure that the strategies at the beginning of the game are not the same than those at the end of the game.

Finally, I did not find the special cards really usefull. I wonder if they are realy worth it. It's not that I don't like special cards, it's just that they are not worth their cost. Still, the special cards are the only element which contains language specific elements, so removing them allows you to play the game without any traduction.

Very good rail game that is very clearly related to Age of Steam.  I came to Volldampf many years after first playing Age of Steam rather than in the order of publication and I prefer the more open nature of the track building in AOS.  That said, this game offers its own set of challenges and manages to feel quite different (and a good deal lighter) in play.  Definitely worth a place on the shelf of a devoted AOS / RRT / Steam player.

I traded for this on a recommendation from [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/2089654#2089654]Scott Nicholson[/url]. He described it as a stepping stone to Age of Steam. As Age of Steam is so difficult (and expensive) to find, I thought I would give Volldampf a shot instead.

Reading through the rules the first time, I was intrigued. The mechanisms were not complicated, but seemed to work together in interesting ways. I was especially impressed that you can only take bonds at one specific time. This means players must plan ahead or be screwed. "Drat! I am one dollar short," was said at least a couple of times during my first 5-player game. I also like the end scoring. Your score is the amount of income you receive. A double use of the score is interesting and I think more games should do something like this.

The game does not remind me of Ticket to Ride at all, but it is certainly more complex. Instead it seems like an early version of Age of Steam (AoS). Two differences seem to separate Volldampf from AoS (based on my understanding without playing the later). First, Age of Steam has limited "character" actions that each player must choose in turn order. Volldampf is simpler as everyone has an opportunity to take all the actions. I am curious how the limited actions of AoS change the game. Second, Volldampf has more luck regarding where goods will appear on the map. This is a good thing as it can help prevent a runaway leader problem.

Now, I only wish it worked well with two players.

Played with 5 and it was just way too chaotic.  Nearly impossible to plan ahead.  And I hated the action cards -- that "More Freight" or "place a new commodity any place you want to so that you can score tons of points without anyone else having a chance to move it" card is just way too powerful.

Also, the components are hugely disappointing -- just little bits of ugly cardboard.

Excellent game. Tactical rather than strategic, it's not as rich as Age of Steam, but it's much quicker, and friendlier. The sometimes maligned action cards serve to give those who have fallen behind a better chance to catch up. Needs at least four players to work well; however with three, try starting the game with a neutral track piece already in place in each of the regions--works pretty nicely. [11 plays]

In this railway game, bid for turn order and right to lay track first. Then deliver goods for income. This maybe Martin Wallace's best game.

I've only played this two players. Works very well as a two player game. The board is small enough, and the various adjustments for two players ensure that you have to mess with your opponent.

Not as good as Railroad Tycoon or Steam or Age of Steam. 

There is potential for huge AP in calculating which cards are best for you, which others will want and thus how important turn order is to you. I think if you stare at the board long enough, you can work this all out. Worse this seems to be the heart of the game, and the winner will be the player who is best at doing this. However I find doing so more work than fun, and the other games in this series were greatly improved by removing these building constraints. 

The randomly drawn event cards seem either unneccesary, or an awkward attempt at a catch-up mechanic.

Since the scores are open and you must use other peoples track in order to advance faster, there is a tendency to avoid helping the person in first, so your best bet is to stay close but not be in the lead. There is also a lot of discussion, since it is best to have routes interconnect and get a little bit from each play. The problem is that the game plays slowly and all through the game there is a king maker aspect to it.

Certainly not Age of Steam "light".  There are a few similarities (shares, income-related scoring, cube deliveries & draws) to AoS, but it is most certainly a different game (building is restricted, action cards, no track tiles, no locomotives).  It seems to be very unforgiving & there are very few deliveries overall.  Not a big fan of the "Sabotage" card.  It will certainly need a few plays to get the hang of.  Very cerebral at times.

Plays much faster than Age of Steam. The bond purchasing is much friendlier. Allows for arbitrary kingmaking but that isn't too much of a drawback.

It's hard not to be reminded of Age of Steam when learning the rules to Volldampf.  But there are some distinct qualities that make the game play feel much different.

Volldampf has a phased turn system.  First all players issue shares.  New goods are placed on the map via card draws.  Players bid on turn order and once turn order is determined players select a set of three link cards.  Players alternate building links up to a maximum of three, one for each card.  The players ship goods twice with colored goods having to go to a city of matching color.  Goods can move up to six links and for every link they cross the player who built that link gets an income increase.  A turn ends with all players getting their current income minus shares issued.

The player with the most points, again computed as income minus shares issued, after a set number of turns wins.

There are no locomotives or special actions to choose as exist in Age of Steam.  But under certain circumstances players can get special power cards that allow them to break the rules.  These special power cards also function as a catch-up mechanism for the player in last place.

The biggest difference with Age of Steam is that all the possible links are already printed on the board, each link being marked with a special symbol.  Each link card also has these same types of symbols on them.  When a player picks a set of link cards they are limited to building on matching links.

Ideally, of course, players want to build a set of six links between the cubes and cities that match those cubes.  However, the randomness of what link cards are available and where cubes will be produced requires players to be more flexible and not expend all their link tokens on a few specific routes.  Also it's smart to instersperse your links with opponents' in order to feed off their shipping actions.

Volldampf is a pretty good game and plays in less than two hours.  For a short train game I would always choose Wabash Cannonball or one of its offshoots instead.  The two games actually have somewhat similar feels.  In Volldampf alliances are formed as player interlace their links while in Wabash the alliances are born out of "interlaced" stock ownership.  If I want to play a bigger game I'd always go for Age of Steam.  I can imagine the special cards in Volldampf really annoying some players since they add a large dose of chaos and surprise back-stabs.

RATING: 8
UPDATE Nov. 2010: Much better with 4 than with 6. There's a huge difference in getting three track cards as opposed to two.

The last game I played, I openly negotiated with my opponents regarding track placement since it is very difficult to establish any routes during the first round. I'm not sure if this is allowed in the rules, but it makes this game by far the best among all of Wallace's Age of Steam series of games.

However, like the Age of Steam series, a mistake early in the game is irreparable. It is a sign of a strategic game. However, your sucky-tude stares you right in the face with that scoring/income track -- it's too blatantly obvious who's going to win in this game. Compare this to the 18xx series of games with obfuscates the players in the lead (a little bit) by locking money up in shares -- most players are not going to bother with the huge multiplication task to figure out who's in the lead.

==========

This game does not work for two players despite what the box says. The event cards unbalance the game. Age of Steam works much better.

UPDATE: Raised from 4 to 6 since this one takes much less time to play than Age of Steam!

UPDATE: Raised from 6 to 8 after playing a six-player and five-player game. This game is *so much better* than Age of Steam! Track construction rules create a network in which you have to ship cubes over your opponent's tracks! This also has much more effective come-back-from-behind mechanisms, and most importantly, very short playing time!

I love train games and had heard good things about this, so this made it to my wish list pretty quick.  I was finally able to track down a copy of this and was very happy I did.  It is different than the train games I usually play (mostly crayon rails).  However, it still has the route connection and delivery that I like so much from Empire Builder.  In this game, there is much more thought regarding your money, though, as money is in short supply and there are a limited number of turns.  Still, I look forward to playing this again soon.  I wonder how this will hold up when Age of Steam gets a reprint?

As games of this ilk go, though, it's one of the better ones.

The is an excellent game in the lineage of Age of Steam.  But it is sufficiently different--faster, the luck is slightly different not really much more prevalent, just different.  The game is a little more forgiving and even with a (very) few mistakes in the beginning it's possible to come back--not to win but it's difficult to go bankrupt entirely.  The game has a small table footprint.  There are 2 each of 7 different cards which are not language independent and should be translated for ease of play.

A worthy addition for the train game fan!

Not really sure how it will play with 2, but it doesn't seem on the surface to be a good contended for a 2-player spot.  Seems like it might be interesting but too chaotic at 6.  Sweet spot is probably 4, maybe 5 if you like higher scores.  With 4 you are still able to create mostly your own lines with a little horning-in by other players.  Competition for cubes to move is not particularly tight.  With 5 you will see an increase in competition to move freight, and turn-order will become important especially for the right to move freight first.  You will also see more blending of scoring as different players increasingly share route construction and profit.

Interesting. I played this after AoS and RRT, and while the similarities are obviously there, there's also considerable difference. Much of the tightness of AoS is here, and the turn-order auction is significant, but the mechanism for choosing track-building opportunites felt good (a hint of San Marco, albeit without the I-cut; you choose element). It seems you're much more likely to use other players' links for shipments. To top it all, the game fits on my kitchen table and plays quickly.

After my second play of Volldampf, I liked it more than the first time I played it. 

Played Age of Steam first. I think the good strength this has over AoS is that the game doesn't slow down when everyone builds their track. It's easier to calculate the number of bonds to issue which speeds up the game too.

Seems to cut the right corners for a quicker AoS without losing too much.

RATING: 6
Volldampf is a solid pick-up-and-deliver train game with an interesting auction mechanism to determine turn order.  However, I think the action cards are a little unbalanced.  There is one that definitely will lead to a large scoring boon for the player who uses it.  There is another that is used to screw exactly one other player.  Since the last-place guy gets more cards than the others, it is likely that the last place guy will have the power to screw one of the players vying for the victory, which is unsatisfying.

UPDATE: Played with 4 and still left me feeling it was just too dry. Traded off.

Short but surprisingly weak game in the vein of Age of Steam or New England Railways.

A four-player game has only four rounds. To balance this, players will usually build three links per turn. The links on the board are divided into six colored regions, and in the order determined by auction (which is performed exactly as in AoS), players will select a lot of three randomly drawn cards, and these indicate where you will be able to build a link.

I don't care for this because the worth of each lot tends to be comparable (so not worth bidding much over), while actually evaluating the worth of the lots is annoying. You may end up with the conclusion that e.g. one of the lots is bad and the rest are fine, so you'd want to bid enough that you simply don't get last pick.

There are no critical special actions to bid on as in AoS, either. There are special action cards awarded to those who can't (or don't want to) ship, and to whoever is in last place each turn. They don't seem like a big deal.

So I mostly felt like nobody ever wanted to bid much in the auction as it rarely seemed anything concrete was at stake.

There is an interesting strategic difficulty in evaluating the worth of a link. Due to the shortness of the game, I think a given delivery won't make you as much money in total as in AoS. But even if the build is a net loss, final income is basically VPs in this game.

Little brother of Age of Steam. Missing parts makes game much lighter and very good for different situation.

A complex train game that apeals also to casual gamers. Very good introduction into meatier games such as Age Of Steam. A much better "Age Of Steam light" then Railroad Tycoon, in my book.

Our group refers to this game as "Age of Steam Lite".  It is only 4 rounds long, and the track segments are already drawn on the board, but it still seems like a very meaty game to me.  I've only played it once, but I would love to have another shot at it.

Very quick game, for when I need to get my train game fix and it's too late for a long game.

Very accessible version of "Age of Steam Lite."

After 2 playings I can say that the chaos factor rises with each additional player. I do not consider this a decent game with 6 players at all. (Caveot: found out we played this wrong with 6 players - will review again after another playing)

Got to play again. I really like this game.

The problem with this game is that it is a less evolved version of Railroad Tycoon.  More random, less fun, less engaging.  Since it is really the same type of game, this one will never get off the shelf again.  I can't think of a situation where I'd play this over Railroad Tycoon.

An overly-constrained system that isn't worth exploring further, although I do appreciate it as an evolutionary checkbox on the brazen path to Age of Steam.

What a disappointment!  With all the cries about Volldampf being AoS-lite I was hoping it would scratch the same itch but with less time commitment involved.  Well, I can definitely see many ideas that were later perfected, but there are just way too much randomness, especially in the track and merchandise cards.  The goal here is not to build a single continuous route but how best to screw others up by taking choke points and forcing them to ship over your sections.  In RRT and AoS part of the strategy is to wait and deliver goods for big points for just yourself, but not so in Volldampf.  Since there is no locomotive restriction (except for the maximum of 6 length), people have to act more shortsighted and move the commodities even if they only gain a small benefit.  Long term planning is virtually pointless here.

Don't get me started on the action cards.  Fairly useless in general and pales in comparison to those in RRT.  Frankly, I'd rather be playing the real thing, and leave this inferior version to people that prefer it.

Rating has gone down A LOT with the release of Age of Steam.  This lite version of AoS is a bit too luck driven to have any real lasting appeal for me.  Both games ended with the person is last place effectively choosing the winner, based on the route they chose which was very unsatisfying.

All the mechanisms in this game interact like clockwork.  A beautiful design.  Did not enjoy as a 2 player.

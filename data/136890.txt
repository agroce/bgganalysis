RATING: 10
You really can't go wrong with the [thing=35342][/thing] system.  This one has some small differences that are more in line with [thing=65313][/thing] (heavy cavalry, cavalry charges).  Having leaders with different morale ratings was a great idea.  Mounted board!  Sharp looking counters, and a full color instructions.  A real winner.

It is a good game.  I tend to play more simpler games.  I never thought I would say it but this is too simple for my tastes.

I am playing this with 15 mm miniatures replacing the counters. 

Much better in my opinion. The few miniatures in each hex gives the game an extra flow on the Age of Reason warfare.

It is not very serious as a study at all. For that you have to search for the BAR games of Clash of Arms or the good Prussia's Glory games of GMT.

But it serves as a nice show off for my miniatures with a light intro to this kind of 18th Century warfare. 

Lack of historical data on units is common these days of "wargames for anyone". A pity because I think the period deserves a better study while being more accessable than the games mentioned above.

Well, it is fun as an introduction and still very much better than Basic Mem44.

This game is simple enough to be quickly picked up on the first play through has enough complexity and different scenarios to keep war gamers coming back. Setup and playtime were both moderate at under 10 minutes for the setup and around 30-45 minutes for the first play, though I will admit it was a simple campaign.

Tradicia batalo-ludo simulanta konfliktojn dum la Sepjara milito (1756-1763).

Not too different from Commands and Colors. Has one or two interesting twists, but I found it all rather insipid.

It is easy, looks nice and not bad at all. But somehow it still feels a bit ordinary to me. I just don't get the thrills that I have when playing acients. 

It the same mechanic but cardplay is removed by rolling a die and see how many activations you get that turn. Easy and with less chance of getting frustated because you are a bit more in control. 

So why do I like acients more??? Is it the time period? The more exotic units? I have no idea to be honest. What I can say is: If you liek these kind of games you own it to yourself to at least check this game out

Good light fun, in the same place as C+C Ancients but without the card activation or flank system.  I'm not sure if that's an advantage or disadvantage yet.

I am happy with this game. It is my first published work and a labor of love. Yet, the rules have holes and I hope to correct those in future titles in the series.

Solo'd Mollwitz & Chotusitz to completion. Simple & fast-playing, very tactical. I used all optional rules and would recommend others do the same as they're pretty light and add some necessary elements to the game.  With those optional rules this is a good 7YW game.

When looking for lighter war games I can bring to a pub and play with friends who are not Grognards, this is one of them. Featuring nice large counters, well written rules, heavy cavalry, cavalry charges, and leaders, you cannot go wrong with this game.

I'm interested in this as an elementary hex and counter game for my collection.  Plays decently solo which is where I intend to start with it.  I don't expect the kids to be interested in it, but I'm building to much meatier war game experiences such as D-Day at Omaha beach and Space Empires 4x.

Love the system but I didn't think that it translated well to the period.

FUN game! Simple and fast to play. It may not be as accurate as the Prussia's Glory or BAR systems, but you can teach someone to play in five minutes and fight a battle in under an hour. There's something to be said for that!

RATING: 6
Simple but poorly organised rules
Terrain and mapboard use a very dull palette
Unit pieces are functional - the artwork is nice

Components-wise this suffers from Worthington production issues although not the worst offender by any stretch. Quite a few of my unit pieces are frayed at the edges or even ripped from when I removed them from the countersheet. The Mapboard doesn't open flat easily as folds aren't entirely square to one another.

Scenarios are varied and the AP rules do allow a certain level of replayability.

For me I think my interest in this period and the fact that the game can be set up and played in an hour or so provides a higher level of satisfaction than expected.

A good light boardgame, suitable for beginners or even casual gamers, but with a few more themed expansions/optional rules I feel this game could have made more of an impact in the hobby.

I recommend it but not over the purchase of any command and colours games - unless the 18th century theme is what you are after. Please bare in mind I have not played the AWI version which in my opinion looks better.

Looks like a great little game after my first play.  I look forward to a couple of rules clarifications but nothing was glaring or beyond my ability to fill in with common sense.

I can choose the unit I want and take action . . . God Bless wargames that aren't card-driven.

RATING: 7
A fine edition to the "Hold the Line" series of games. The designer adapted the base rules to properly reflect the era of Frederick the Great. My only concern is with the 'Hold the Line' rules in general. As this is an introductory system, I have seen some games come right down to 'dumb luck' and skewed die rolls can completely destroy the gaming experience. There are optional rules which players can pick and choose, but I would recommend leaving out any rule that can increase casualties. The general system is very luck dependent.

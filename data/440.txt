GAME: Zoff in Buffalo
RANK: 4285

RATING: 9
Place down two pairs of cow and field cards. Then everyone reveals their choices at the same time and cows are placed in the fields from the smallest field to the biggest. There are never ties in this game, so if you may be forced to play one [or more!] less cows than you originally planned to avoid a tie from resulting. The game is strange in that you tend to do well if you are in second place. Bonus cows are awarded when a field is completely filled, giving the person with the most cows less to place, but the opportunity to place their bonus first, and second and third place more cows [but having to place later.] The person who played the most cows after five rounds wins the game.

Played with Leon's acrylic cows. A MUST-PLAY at any convention where he is.

I would think the goofy theme would be a little more attractive to me...but the game doesn't hold it well. I just felt like we were competing for control of areas....which we were. This twist on an area control game IS kind of interesting, but I would only play this game again at the behest of someone that really wanted to play. Its not a terrible game, just one that I don't get much enjoyment from personally.

Cowboys drive their cows here to the biggest auction in the Wild West. The players must attempt to find grazing for their cows on the limited pasture.Zoff is another area majority game that plays light and fast. In this one we are trying to place the most cows in ten different pastures. The pastures vary in the number of cows they can accommodate running from 6 to 28, and when filled, confer a cow bonus of 1, 2, or 3 cows to the players that have the most cows in that field; perhaps representing reproduction?

Cute game about cramming cattle into cattle pens.  Pen cards are secretly played to indicate where your coloured cows are going, all revealed and resolved.  Of course, there isn&#039;t enough room for everyone.  Quick enough to play again.  The system came back as Vino which is twice as long and twice as dull.

Somewhat chaotic, especially with 5, but I like the restrictions caused by the no-ties mechanism, as well as the possibilities for chain reactions when fields are completed.

Man, is this an abstract game?!   Very dry.  Cute plastic cows relieve the dryness a little and the short playing time means it is a fairly action packed 30 minutes.  Bluff and counter-bluff play a part as the orer you play the cows is sinificant and this is determined by simultaneous card play.

RATING: 6.5
Interesting game of trying to out-think opponents of where to place cows and number of cows.  You can never have the same number of cows as another player, so you may not be able to place as many cows as the number on your card if it will tie you with another player.  Whomever has the fewest cows at the end of the game wins.  Gets particularly tight at the end of the game when pastures are full!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Interesting, light game. The fact that the player who is dealt a cow in the six pasture is simply handed that pasture annoys the game developer in me, but overall I like the game and that's trivial to fix by not including the six card in the initial deal.

Simultaneous action selection. A game that plays very quickly (25-30 minutes). On the designer's website there are rules for playing with 6 people that works very well! Also because it is simultaneous action, adding more people doesn't really affect play time.

I've always played this game with Leon's trekked out copy that has acrylic cows. It is the coolest copy of the game ever.

Nice little game, all players have the same options and it is out-thinking your opponents that will get you the extra cows to win. A little bit of bluff and a little bit of thinking what your opponents may do and try to out-guess them. 
A filler game of just the right length and complexity to get you thinking.

Really enjoyable double guessing game that really forces quite a few decisions in the final round or two as fields start closing down.  Fascinating rule that you can never have the same amount of cows in a pasture as someone else really is a creative wrinkle in this game.  Plays very quickly - probably a 20-30 minute game once everyone knows what's going on and understands that you can't have the same number of cows in a field as someone else.  This game is best with more people; I would not recommend playing with less than 4.

I was curious about this game after hearing about it on a podcast, and got to play it at Atlanta Game Fest 13 (thanks, Leon!).  Neat game with cool mechanics.  Who wouldn't love putting purple cows into fields?  We played 5-player, so it was fairly chaotic.  I can imagine the game being more strategic with fewer players.  Good fun.

This game has some interesting mechanics. The most interesting being that you can't have the same amount of tiles as someone else.

Although this game has some unique mechanics, I don't care for the game. I think it is a brain burner for how light it is.

Game where you pace cows in pasture. Everyone has the same number of chances to place the same number of cows, but it depends on when the pastures fill up and if you try to place the same number of cows in the pasture as another player (if you do, you cannot place the tying cow).

I wasn't aware of one rule until halfway through the game (the one where at the end of all rounds, you get bonuses for unfinished pastures but can only place the bonus cow IN the pasture that earned you the bonus) which screwed me up. I would like to try it again with the one game under my belt but I'm still not sure the game is worth the effort. It seems like no matter how much thought you put into it, the end result will be mostly random due to the way the bonuses tend to happen in a domino-like fashion. You'd need to look down the path way too far for my liking to make sure things play out the way you want them too, and even then, that's assuming that all the other players make an optimal move (which, of course, is never going to happen:-) So, you might as well not put any thought into it because too much is going to happen that's just out of your control. I was additionally frustrated by the cramped quarters of the pastures and the odd angles of where the cows were placed. Even grouping the colors together it was hard at times to tell who had how many cows where and what placements were legal/illegal and beneficial. By the end of the game my head hurt.

RATING: 6
A quirky majorities game where we’re competing to place cows in pastures before they fill up. The pastures range in size from 6 cows to about 28 cows. They all have fun wild-west names, and each player has one pasture card for each. You also have 10 cow cards that allow you to place 2, 3, 4 or 5 cows and these are one-use only.

On a turn, you secretly choose 2 pastures and allocate a cow card to each (ie you’re nominating how many cows you want to place in each pasture). Simultaneously reveal. Now the (good) pain starts. Going from smallest to biggest pasture, each player places their cows. However if more than one player has nominated the same pasture, whoever’s already got the most cows there goes first. Then whoever’s got second most cows and so on. If they don’t have any, then whoever wants to place the least cows goes first.

The winner is the person who places the most cows out to pasture. Given you all start with the ability to place the same number of cows, the game devolves to:
- there can never be a tie, because you’re NEVER allowed to end up with the same cows as someone else in a pasture, so try and pick a number that avoids you ending in a tie with someone else, otherwise you don’t get to place all your cows!
- when each pasture fills, bonus cows are awarded to first, second and generally third. 1 bonus cow to first, and generally more bonus cows to second and third. The fight to be second therefore is the key. You must get more bonuses than the other players to win.

What results is a fun game with lots of changes of decisions, cards going up and down before the final revelation, trying to outguess who is going to go where based on their position in the pastures.

It’s light and fluffy due to the simultaneous play and 30 minute timeframe, but it has good decisions to make each and every round. Mooooo.

Any game seems to get automatic love if it includes images of cows.  "Trouble in Buffalo" also has a kind of western flavor with the names of the fields (such as "High Noon Hills").  It's about placing your cows in fields, guessing where other players will try to place theirs since no two players are allowed to have the same number of cows in a field.

Clever little game of trying to second guess how other players are trying to lay out pieces on boards with limited space. If you get it just right you get extra placements and can finish with more pieces played and therefore win. The pieces are cows and the boards are pastures; there's some justification of the theme at the beginning of the rules but I only glanced at it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's a game about putting cows in pastures. You start the game with a set of numbered cards, each of is removed from the game when used. Each turn you pair two numbered cards with two pastures and all players reveal their choices at the same time. The numbered cards determine how many cows you move into that pasture. Starting with the smallest pasture, players move in their cows to that pasture. If there is competition, players who have cows in that pasture move their cows first, otherwise higher numbered cards go first. You cannot move in a number of cows that would cause a tie between herd sizes in that pasture, but you can move in fewer than the number on your card.

Each pasture offers a bonus to the top two or three herds, which is awarded when the pasture fills up or at the end of the game. If it's upon filling up, the award recipients receive extra cows to immediately place in other pastures. At the end, whoever has put the most cows to pasture wins.

It's a cute theme, and it has enough randomization and strategy that I'd be willing to play it more.

cows cows cows! 
a game where the cattle baron with the largest herd of cows across multiple pastures wins. the trick is that there cannot be a tie for "most cows" in any of the pastures!

this was really fun!!!! i thought it was going to be a dud but it's a great longer filler. the simultaneous action selection and clever "no ties" rule brings a bit of fun chaos to what looks like a dry computational exercise. the only downside is the three zillion cow chits. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Interesting area-control/hand-management game with funny-looking cows on the chits! The key rule is not being allowed to have the same number of cows in a pasture as anyone else -- that really changes things! It almost has a blind-bid feel, but not in a bad way at all: you have some basis for making decisions, and even if you choose badly you'll hopefully still be able to place _some_ cows!

--- Summary ---
Place the pastures in the center. Each has a different number of spaces for cows. Arrange these in order of increasing size. Players start with 2 cows randomly placed into the pastures, and an identical set of cards (one group numbered 2-5 and showing a letter, and another matching the pastures.

Each round, players simultaneously 2 pairs of cards, each with a pasture and number. Reveal all pairs and resolve each pasture in order, smallest to largest. In each, players place cows into the pasture in order:
- player with the most cows already in pasture
- tiebreaker: lower numbered card
- tiebreaker: earlier letter on card
- NOTE: may NEVER have exactly the same number of cows in a pasture as any other player
- NOTE: if run out of pasture spaces, may not place any more in that pasture (and all players may discard that pasture card)
- if a pasture fills, 1st and 2nd (and in some cases, 3rd) place in that pasture get to place additional cows into other pastures (following normal restrictions). 2nd and 3rd place often place _more_ additional cows than 1st place!

All played numbered cards are discarded, but pasture cards return to each player's hands.

The game ends when all numbered cards have been played, or when all pastures are full. The player with the fewest cows remaining wins!

Zoff in Buffalo is one of those games where you are partway through your first game when, suddenly, you realize that what you took as a largely chance-based game turns out to be terribly tactical--it's just that the tactics are about something completely different from what you thought the game is about. The game just plugs along until a suddenly very tense end-game of placement. There were some interesting placement rules here that kept it feeling unique, and the endgame was fun even though my color-blindness allowed some stupid errors on my end to slip through when I didn't realize some blue and purple bits were different colors. Oh, well. I'd give this another shot now that I understand it a bit better.

COLORBLINDNESS NOTE: I personally found the blue and purple pieces very hard to distinguish, leading to some stupid plays on my part. Careful!

This really too long for what it is and rewards calculation a little more than a game of its type should. It was quite satisfying being able to set up chains of rewards, but I don't really think that I need to play it again.

When I sat down to this one I didn't know what to expect at all. I had never heard of it and basically sat down because I was between other games. Boy was I glad I did that. This is a nice, quick, clever little game. I don't know how hard it would be to track down a copy of the thing but I think that it would be worth it to try seeing that i think it would go over very well with our particular group dynamic. 

I've played this again, with two players.  I think this game hits me in lots of right spots.  I like the blind 'bidding' and the double think with the way to use your limited number of cow cards from throughout the game so you are not limited in your placements by what others do.

Zoff in Buffalo brings simultaneous action selection and a sense of chaos to what is normally a dry math problem, and that seems to be its appeal.  The theme of meandering, defiant cows is perfect.  Light and fast; the only downside is a blizzard of chits.

This is another game where you're trying to out-think your opponent in a blind placement (I tend to like that style of game), but it's elevated by having an interesting mechanism where no ties can exist anywhere on the board.  It creates an interesting incentive where you're trying to be first to place in an area, but you have to pick the right number of cows to place, hope that no one changes that before you get there, and that you'll have the space and ability to place your cows when it comes to your turn.  Given the nature of how you compete for regions, I'm guessing this works best with a maximum of five players.  I'm interested in playing this again.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A neat game that plays quick but involves a lot of different mechanics and decisions.  There's a bit of area majority, but the problem is being first in a pasture is not necessarily good.  It's true you rid of yourself the most cows that way, but the bonus placement almost always favor the lesser herd(s).  So do you keep yourself in the back but risk the chance of being completely shut out?  There is also the difficulty of not being able to have a group of the same size as another.  Which means without careful consideration, you could end up putting down less cows than you intended to.  It sucks when you play the 5 card but can only place 2.

There is also a smidge of hand management.  Since the numbered cards are limited as well as having a letter that determines the play order.  The timing becomes especially important.  It can mean the difference between being in 3rd with a bonus of two or in 4th with nothing to claim.

Fast and challenging, a filler with quite a punch.

As this is an update of the original B-17, I'm eager to give this a whirl... but haven't had the time, alas.

Not a bad game. More focus on weather effects, fuel management, plane malfunctions, etc. A LOT of dice-rolling.

Fantastic stories come out of this game. Although there are almost zero decisions to be made during the game, you are really along for the ride, and you really feel for each member of your crew. Until a zero manages to shoot through the bomb bay and set of a massive explosion that kills everyone on board.

I like it a lot, but appreciate it is most definitely not for people who prefer drier games.

Great game. It is very detailed ang give you the feel of really piloting a B29. Highly realistic. There is not much combat and in a sense it resembles a flight simulator a little. Anyway, there is also combat so you get everything in one box! Recommended.

RATING: 6
Like B-17 Queen of the Skies, but more so. Fewer enemy fighters. Much made about navigation and aircraft survival. Taking off can wreck you. Huge number of tables. This is worth it for the experience of learning what the crews did on a B-29 and how the missions worked. I`m glad to have it but have to be in the right mood to play this. Given a straight choice, B-17 is better IMHO.

in relation to B-17 QotS, They have added a lot of dices rolling that not add that much to the realism. Also there are tons of modification that you have to look at every time you move from zone to zone.
For example, you have to roll 3/4 times just to know your navigation modifier. 
This means: 
- look at the table, 
- roll the dices, 
- check the modifiers,
- reroll a dice,
- add the final result in the navigation modifier      traker,
- repeat the procedures for all the others table,
- after 3 tables you know exactly your final navigation modifier
- roll to know if you are "on course" or "off course"

All this "downtime" generates a sort of abstraction from the game that make you feel like a dices rolling robot

Purchased as an alternative to paying a premium for B-17 Queen of the Skies.  Mainly involves die throwing with only a small number of player decisions (although these can often be the difference between life and death).  Even so, the historical background is very interesting and you often care about the fate of the crew you've created.  I'm nine missions into the full campaign and have already lost three aircraft and over thirty crew members - some of whom died as prisoners of war.

Uggggh, very disappointed in B29. The game adds extra complications for no apparent reason, IMO. Much better components than B17, but the gameplay just didn't feel as fun to me, Just random rolling on charts for an hour, when a mission in B17 would take 15-20 minutes.

More decision-making than in B-17, though still more a simulation than a game.  Also different from B-17 in that weather, navigation, and fuel consumption are at least as likely to kill you as enemy fighters are.  There are a few things to quibble about, like the inconsistent naming convention for the Japanese fighters and the way the details of a few die rolls are hidden in the rules rather than with the charts.  Still, very enjoyable and quite detailed.

Bought this as a souped up B17, before further reading made it clear that the B29 'experience' was very different - too high and too fast for a weak Japanese figher arm, it faced equal perils from weather, fuel, and equipment malfunctions. So the 'Steel City' took off, got a little lost, got back on course, hit some bad weather, and finally got to the target. A couple of fighters whizzed past - we didn't hit them, and they didn't hit us. Bombs away, and a complete miss at high altitude, and then we turn back. A Japanese ace in a 'George' attacks. My gunners miss, and we brace for damage. And then he is gone, without a scratch. Flying home, we find the fuel has been miscalculated, but there's still plenty in the tank, and the rookie pilot manages a night landing without a hitch. Lots of dice rolling, endless chart look-ups, and more modifiers than you can shake a stick at. Only a few decisions (pressurisation, assigning gunners, evasive action if you fall out of formation). The mission was hardly the epitome of excitement. But you know that a few different rolls, and I lose a navigator, or an engine, or get rammed, and then suddenly it all looks very different. And I want to play it again...

RATING: 5
B-29 is in the vein of B-17 and the Hunters. It's at its core a die and charts game, that doesn't really give a whole lot to decide to the player. However, I find B-29 superior to both B-17 and the Hunters, mainly because of the depth it goes into historical context and technical accuracy. Also, the game generates more variety in the situations it depicts than its competitors, even if the amount of meaningful decisions offered to the player stays low.
Overall, B-29 is a nice occasional diversion from the games I usually play. Be warned that in B-29 you'll be fighting mechanical failures, navigation errors, and weather more than enemy fighters. But it's also what separates it from B-17.

Very similar experience to that of B-17, mechanics are pretty much the same.  I like B-17 better for a couple of reasons, first B-17 was actually innovative at its publication and secondly I like the bombing missions over Europe more, just seems more dangerous than what the Americans had to deal with an already shattered Japan.  This is evident in the game play, which is a testament to both game's great design to simulate the situation respectively.  

But having just said that, I really like B-29 as well, the chrome is slightly different and there is more emphasis on Navigation and Fuel consumption instead of fighting off attacks.  Not to mention that this one is still in print.

Two thumbs up.

This is an excellent game/simulation which focuses on the player operating a single B-29 out of the Marianas and Iwo Jima. Yes, there are many, many charts and lots of dice rolling, but the details of this game are staggering. Just about any situation and malfunction/accident  imaginable can happen to the bomber and her crew. Basically nothing was left out. To simulate this level of detail, multiple charts and lots of dice rolling are just part of the deal. But with that said, one can also play with simpler rules if they choose.

I have noticed that many players complain that there are few player decisions to be made in B-29. This is true, as it was in real life for a B-29 pilot. But there is decision making if and when the bomber falls out of formation. Quite a few decisions, including some that may cost the crew their lives if wrongly made.

One of the only negatives I can think of is that there are many, many dice roll modifiers. But like I said, B-29 is such a detailed simulation that this is unavoidable.

In my opinion, this game/simulation is more complex than Target for Today, and will take a bit more time to learn. But well worth it in my opinion.

*Edit* I have bumped up my review  of B-29 to 9 stars after coming up with a streamlined game turn system that really speeds up missions. What took me 45 minutes before now takes me about 30 minutes, and the longer missions with lots of combat that took at least 1 hour and 20 minutes now only takes about an hour. So basically this system cuts at least 15-20 minutes off of each mission. Anyone interested can find the download here:

RATING: 6
Not so much a game as a narrative generator.  Not to say it's bad.  Far from it.  It's quite good at what it is.  It most reminds me of Tales of the Arabian Nights actually.  There is so little that you are in control of and so much that you just roll for.  Basically whether you destroy a major city of Japan or go down in flames is completely up to a couple of different dice rolls.

The subject is also a little dark.  Bombing urban areas is brutal.  In that way, B-29 does not flinch from history but attempts to accurately depict possible results and tensions and objectives.

Traded for GD '40.

War in it's most unglamorous form, a nightmare of equal parts boredom and lethality. You drive a skybus full of death to rain fire at civilians who've never done you any harm while people you've never met tries to kill you. When you or your crew die it's by pure coincidence and for no damn reason. A lucky shot. A fuel leak. Material fatigue. Some industrialist cutting corners to make a buck. 

Then, when you're statistically dead five times over and a nervous wreck from PTSD, you get the ultimate reward - you get to go back home. 

Awesome in concept, a bit tiresome with all the dice rolling. Would have worked better as a card game with chit pull mechanics.

Excellent wargame components.  Detailed research and comprehensive, interesting rulebook.  Immersive storytelling and no doubt very good statistical simulation value.  However, game play seemed a bit tedious and a little light on actual decision making. (roll dice-lookup on chart, rinse, repeat) In spite of this it told an immersive story. Game might have been sped up with charts integrated in the rules and not in a separate book.

First impressions are good.  Content is well-done and very professional execution of components.  First read of the rules has a feel of B-17:QotS, which the authors admit they followed as a base to this games design.

I don't normally play solitaire games. I had just read about the air campaigns over Japan in 1945 and got this game cheap off a friend. I tried a mission and rolled a LOT of dice. I didn't really decide much. I also flipped a ton of pages and checked a ton of charts. The historical feel and research was amazingly well done. The game itself - almost no excitement to play.

LOTS of tables and dice rolling (although that's to be expected from a complex solitaire game). While there are extensive rules on "movement" and combat, it seemed like (in the two missions I've played so far), that combat rarely happens and rarely has an effect on my plane and movement doesn't build much tension. More missions are needed.

I think this game is going to be rated higher but I have only read the rules and set it up on one of my gaming tables so I can't yet give it more than a BGG 5 (average-take it or leave it) rating.  I'm hoping each flight can be played under an hour as there are potentially 35 flights per game.  I have assembled a crew of ten friends and myself (You can name the crew positions so I asked some friends if they would like to participate virtually and get flight updates.)  If our plane goes down several families will (virtually) lose a few members so that should add to the tension.  The game concept is intriguing.  It looks like it will be a nice interactive narrative type game.  It's based on an older game called  B-17.  I look forward to being able to give it an 8+ after play.

Edit.  It's still sitting on a table un-played.  I think it doesn't fit the type of game I want to play right now.

An underrated but all-around solid simulation.  I certainly appreciate the research and effort that went into making this game.  The design and player's notes are spread throughout the rulebook and are interesting reads.  Also, the quotes from those who participated in the campaign is a really nice touch.  The books for the rules and charts look intimidating, but the game is not complex at all.  Did I say game?  What it really is, is a simulation that provides a great narrative and can teach you a few things while you're having fun.

If you are a fan on the old AH game B-17, then you will be a fan of this one since it the game play is almost identical (although this one has more charts). On the other hand, if you were not a fan of B-17, this one will not change your mind since the same perceived flaws in B-17 are here as well.

I rate it a six because it is a clever design combined with mind numbing randomness. Yes, it generates a compelling narrative but should I really have to sift through all of these charts and roll all of these dice to get that?

Although there are few actual decisions to make in this game, I enjoy it nonetheless. You name and choose a B-29 aircraft and crew with the job of flying to your target, holding off attacking fighters, hopefully successfully bombing the target, and making it back for a smooth landing. This rarely goes as planned.

You roll dice against charts to see how everything goes. You can make a few broad choices, but mostly you just set it up and let it fly and see what happens. However, the story that emerges from this is just so fun to watch. The act of naming your crew gives you instant investment in them, and the little things that happen allow you to fill in personality and become attached.

An amazing experience, if not quite a "game" in the general sense.

A fun simulation that I do not mind keeping for its sheer uniqueness. While you consult a lot of charts to see what happens, the charts do tell a story that I enjoy.

I have ran a dozen or so missions now. Some crews have made it home, and some crews have died. My planes have ran into Bad Weather, fighters coming in from all directions, flak, running out of fuel and malfunctions. My crews have had to bail out in rough seas (crew lost). They have been blown into little pieces over Japan due to flak damage. A few have even lived to tell the tale of their rough landing that totaled the plane and killed 3 men. I have even had a mission or two where everything went like clockwork and everyone made it home OK. 

I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys war sims. It does have a pretty steep learning curve, but is well worth the effort. Please see my review and various session reports for more information.

24/03/2013: Pretty fun solitaire game. There is a lot of tension during the game, especially when you are flying through enemy airspace and hoping you come out unscathed (which was probably every flyer's wish at the time). Haven't managed to get my bombs on target yet, but have already lost two crew members in two missions. Hoping to get this more to the table. 

27/03/2013: Upped rating to 9, as the variability of the mission's outcome is guaranteed in view of the dice roll. Not to be taken seriously (as with all games that involve dice), though the tension is certainly there especially when flying over enemy zones and bombing the target (where I have yet to succeed so far).

Finally managed to sit down & play thro' my first mission to Nagoya. Thankfully it was uneventful; but did include a rather nice 50% on target when bombing.

Definitely more 'busy' than B-17, but not more complex. I look forward to getting this one on the table again as soon as possible.

[BGCOLOR=#000000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]SoloX.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] [BGCOLOR=#FF3300][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Wargame.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Solitaire, Simulation. Impression after first practice mission. Very thorough, detailed simulation of flying a bombing mission from the Marianas Islands to Japan. It's not complicated, per se, so much as having tons of procedures and tables to consult, with lots of dice rolling. There are some decisions to be made, such as cabin pressurization, deciding if you should abort the mission, etc. Looking forward to more plays, as well as playing our campaign game with my gaming club. See my review for more detail.

Traded away after a long hiatus on my shelf. I have plenty of solitaire games now and competition for space/time is tight.

Solid redesign of B-17, but with few mechanical troubles ;) . The Japanese counters are confusing, because they display the Japanese names, while the rules mention them in their Allied code names. (There are also two planes labeled Ki-44.) 

Overall the rules are laid out better than in B-17, but in keeping the game more realistic there are fewer encounters with fighters and more tables to consult, which is sensible, because weather, fuel consumption and navigation were more crucial factors than enemy resistance. However, the result is: Less action, longer play time.

EDITED COMMENTS.

Having now played B-29, I can say that I found it to be a better than average offering. While there is a lot of table-shuffling and looking up things, everything is listed in order of play in the rulebook and is easy to follow.

I have modified my former rating of 9 slightly to reflect my opinion of the game, its components, and how it plays.

I recommend B-29 for anyone who has an interest in the subject matter, or in solitaire games.

Original posting:

Received this on 4/11/08. 

The rating is solely for the components and graphics. This is a beautiful game. I'm reading the rules and will sit down to give it a play tomorrow and will post a revised rating at that time. Once I've played it a few times, I will make a final revision to the rating. 

From a scan of the rules it is NOT "much much more complex" than B-17. They've added things like fuel consumption but my initial impression--without actually playing, mind you--is that it might be a bit busier than B-17 but not much more complex.

Not for everyone taste and not enough japaneses fighters attacking but it's easy&fun to me to put myself in the shoes of those bastard.The Teamwork needed to do the duty's dirty work must has been a creator of so much frienship.

Solo game that does an incredible job of simulating the career of a B-29 bomber crew during the last stages of WW2.  I highly recommend this if you like solitaire games or if you are interested in the details of the bombing campaign against the Japanese in WW2.

Very detailed solitaire game of B-29 missions over Japan during WW2. Some slight blemishes to the game in that the rules mention all the Jap fighters by the name used by the Allies whilst all the counters have the Japanese names.  Other issues are how some of the items needed are in the chart books whilst others are in the rule book.  Would've been better to have all DR actions be represented in the chart and tables book vs having to flip back and forth.

Nicely researched game, lots of details on the B29. One of the better written game manuals, I've read. I thought it was overly complicated with not much action. This may be partly inherit of the subject matter since the the B29 was required to fly over vast areas of water before reaching its target. B17 is a better game.

B-29 Superfortress is a very good simulator. Admittedly there are not a whole lot of in-game decisions to be made, but the game does tell a great story. This is the kind of game I typically like to spread out over time and play a couple of missions every now and then. If you don't run into too much trouble a mission can play very quickly (1 hour or less). I also have the [thing=38498][/thing] expansion in my collection. Will give that one a go when I have finished the 35 mission campaign in the base game.

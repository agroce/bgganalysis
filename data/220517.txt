Backed this game on kickstarter, and did not regret it when the game arrived ahead of schedule!  This game is really great for mental deduction, easy to learn and people can join and leave the game as they please.  Great as something to start while waiting for others to arrive!

Recently picked this up through kickstarter.  This game is pretty unique in it's mechanisms.  Each turn you have to essentially figure out the best clue to give your teammates to help them solve a logic/math puzzle.  There is almost always a best play to be made, and it only takes relatively simple math and deduction to figure it out.  This means there ultimately aren't a whole lot of choices to make.  Usually, I would say this is a negative, but the fun here is finding the best clue and watching the other players reason it out.  This game would be great to play with children to help them with basic math and deduction skills.  The artwork is also outstanding.  Great casual filler game that definitely makes you think!

This Hanabi successor allows more group discussion (and allows players to come and go). The art and Tarot theme is also great, and it's fairly cheap (under 20 dollars)

This game is AMAZING if you like logic puzzles. The subtlety of the logic and the amount of inference you can make off a good play is awesome. The one downside is that there is definitely some luck involved in what "fates" (tiles) you draw; I haven't been majorly impacted by this often, but it can happen.

I backed it on KS and like it as a good lunch time game (I work with a bunch of engineers so this game is right up our alley). I don't think I will ever get rid of this one.

I would say that this game has a niche player and is not going to appease everyone. If you like Hanabi, you should definitely check this game out.

Played one game with three others.  One woman was expressing how she wasn't catching on while I explained the instructions, but after a round she was totally getting it.  We barely won (on easy level), but it was such a high!  A bonding experience.

Kickstarted. Arrived promptly to Thailand. Very securely shipped. Excellent Quality Components and included stretch goal extra cards.  Rules sheet is very good paper stock but clearly the folded size does not match the box well. 
Game looks like it plays well, but I fear it may prove a little too easy and I'm wondering if more "fate" tiles (numbers you need to deduce from the clues) would not be useful. Time will tell and I will rate after a few plays.

I really like the mechanics and the thoughtfulness required to play this game. As I played though, I noticed that a lot of predictions came down to 50/50 guesses between two numbers. Maybe we'll get better with subsequent plays and maybe the Arcana cards we had out weren't ideal. I may revise on further plays.

1 play as a four player game. Really liked the aesthetic and production quality. Love the idea of the logic puzzle of the game... But we found it way too easy... Maybe luck of the draw? I hope so.

This is an excellent "filler" game, taking only about 20 minutes to play; quick enough to play on your lunch break at work.

The game is thinky, requiring the players to work together to really analyze what's going on. It gives you a good brain workout. Also, "cooperative deduction" is a fun mechanic, a la Mysterium. 

The components are excellent; beautiful tarot-sized (and tarot-inspired) cards with incredible artwork, high-quality wood tiles, embroidered tile bag, etc. The only substandard component is the rule sheet which is a single sheet of paper folded to fit in the box (as opposed to a nice booklet).

Fun, light, fast coop deduction and delivers on all those attributes.  Some of the deductions are easy, but many nicely give that feeling of being clever (even if it may be a bit of an illusion).  Very well done.

Got to play this at Gencon and it was as good as I expected.  I am rating it based on my desire to be able to really strengthen deductive reasoning in my children.

It also has legs to be a filler or warm up game as it isn't heavy thought at all.

The Shipwreck Arcana is a short cooperative deduction game.  On a player's turn, he draws two tiles from a bag of tiles numbered 1 through 7.  Then, he places one of those tiles on one of a rotating series of cards, if it meets the rules for that particular card.  Based on this information, the players have to guess the tile that the player kept in his hand.  This may seem pretty difficult, but by eliminating numbers that wouldn't follow that card's rule, and trying to determine why the player placed there instead of someone else, it's often determinable.  Correct guesses advance a green marker, incorrect guesses (and time) advance a red marker--you need to reach the end of the track with the green marker before the red to win.  This is a pretty cool concept, and I enjoyed it.  However, I found that with an analytical group it can be a bit easy.

I wasn't expecting much from this, and I was pleasantly surprised.   
The game is a delight, and while some card combinations are frustrating to work with, the spread is generally fairly solid.
Not only that but the art is fantastic, the Kickstarter campaign was handled professionally, and delivered ahead of schedule!  How often do you hear that?

I brought Shipwreck Arcana to my game night side by side with Rising Sun, and it still ended up being the beloved centerpiece of the event.

I had never heard of this game and it was a Kickstarter.  It ended up really surprising me, I quite enjoyed it.  This is a coop that is actually really hard to explain without the visual aids but I'm going to give it my best shot.  Players work together to advance their goal marker to the end of a track before a doom marker gets there.  They do this by every turn drawing 2 tiles from a bag, placing one, and trying to get their partners to guess the other.  The tile placed is placed next to cards that have criteria on them like "both tiles add up to 11 or more" so if I place a 5 there my partners would know that my other tile is either a 6 or a 7 (the tiles only go up to 7).  There's a bit more to it but it would take too long to explain all the nuances.

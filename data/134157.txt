RATING: 7
1 play / 3 players (3p=3h)

LIKE: Lots of combos to be found either through cards or on the tiles. The beginning game feels compact, but then builds out, which is a nice transition. I liked the multi-use cards and planning out your turn.

DISLIKE: Mega iconography, but this goes away after a few rounds and a few basic icons cover majority of the cards. Some cutthroat moves, which some groups may be averse to. Lots of min/maxing, prone to AP, so the game can get long.

OVERALL: Although a long game, I enjoyed it and felt there was lots of room for combo-exploring and competing with other players.  This one had a lot going on, and it felt best as 3 players unless all players were quick. It seems I have an affinity towards area majority games.

A lighter version of this would be "World's Fair 1893".

RATING: 7
Definitely a 4 player game, has some nice opportunities for combos and clever plays. The bonus point scoring cards though are hugely swingy and some are clearly a lot better than others (6 points for no liverman, useless, utterly useless).

Quite variable new area majority game.  It has some hand management and some engine-building, but it doesn't really excel at either.  I didn't get much of a feeling that turn 12 was that much different than turn 1.  That being said, I had a good time solving mini hand management puzzles.  Hated the iconography learning curve, though...ouch.

RATING: N/A
Abstract:
Players compete for the majority of different guilds (tiles) in London. A multi-used card game by Tony Boydell, the designer of the excellent Snowdonia. Cards can be used to place pawns, move pawns, use special abilities, or pay gold.

Pros:
+ Multi-used cards: a lot of combinations how to spend which card (puzzly)
+ A lot of different special abilities
+ Tense area-control: competing for first or second place on each tile
+ Masters needed for special actions: a player will not win by focusing on second place only
+ Interesting tie-breaker mechanic (accounting a player's masters who are surrounding other tiles)
+ Building own end-game goals
+ High variability in each game
+ Plays well with all player counts (2-4)

Neutrals:
# Artwork is fine
# Theme is okay
# High randomization: different order of cards and tiles
# Luck depends on drawn cards
# High direct player interaction: a lot of actions to get rid of opponent's liveryman (it is the only purpose of the neutral liveryman) - very competitive and mean
# A player holding many neutral liveryman has a lot of power, especially if he is last in turn order
# Being last gives a player tactical advantage in regard to area control


Negatives:
- Hard to teach: a lot of iconography, overwhelming board
- Rules are not so easy to understand

Similar to:
* Race for the Galaxy: regarding the size of iconography, multi-used cards
* Bruges: multi-used cards with a lot of different actions, but less indirect player interaction

Thoughts:
I love the combination of multi-used cards with area control. I also like the massive variety of the multi-used cards. However, the game is hard to teach, especially for a game group with changing people.

Player: 1-4 | Time: 45-90m

RATING: 6
Interesting game.  Area control-ish with lots (and I mean LOTS) of powers thrown in.  The mechanisms are solid but very much not for me.  Here's why:

(1) Action card powers are not balanced cost-wise.
(2) Action card powers are completely unbalanced power-wise.
(3) Mayoral reward cards are *very* situational and swingy.

The action cards are determinative of everything you can do.  If you get a "good" card draw (color-wise) for what you want, you'll be fine.  If you don't, you won't and you'd better find that back up plan in the wings, if it even exists.  I can live with the swinginess on the color of the cards - that's a game mechanism and almost works fine.  The worst is that you can get totally screwed on which color of guilds are remaining and you can't get liverymen to them because your colors don't match.  Oh well.  What I can't live with (metaphorically speaking) is the swinginess in action card powers.

First, there are cards that have the exact same power BUT WITH DIFFERENT COSTS!  So while one version of the power is free, another version of the SAME power will cost 1 coin/card more.  This is HUGE.  I will refuse to pay the extra coin/card because (a) I shouldn't have to when my opponent can play it for free; and (b) it passes the cost-benefit point for the power.  Cards are actions are life, so one version costing an additional coin/card is just silly.  It doesn't create tension, it just creates unstructured imbalance for no positive gameplay purpose.

Then we get to the powers.  Some are ridiculously better than others!  (And I mean RIDICULOUSLY better.)  In particular, the free card draw ones are stupidly good.  What's that, for no additional cost I get to draw 4 extra cards at the end of my turn?  SOLD!  (Cards are actions are life!)  If those cards are not evenly distributed (hello random draw!), then the players on the short end of the stick will suffer and probably lose.  (They spend entire turns drawing more action cards while others don't have to because they found the cards that short circuit this.)  Also, there are numerous cards with similar powers where one power will just be better than another.  I don't mean situationally better, I mean flat out better with little-or-no balancing mechanism!  Just plain old better.  Again, better luck of the draw is more likely to lead to better results.

The mayoral reward cards are yet another source of random swinginess, just hidden this time.  These are better since it's always draw 2-3 and keep 1, thus the luck is mitigated a bit.  Still, they have the potential for huge swings.  If I draw the right one, I can make as many as 11 points (though more commonly it's a max of 6-8 points).  If I draw bad ones, I get 0 points.  So whoever gets more of these that synergize (either among themselves or with the guilds the player has) is more likely to win.  This is another game mechanism component so I'm more willing to accept it as a given, but I don't feel that they enhance the game very much when a random draw can lead to a significant point differential.

In other words, this is a solid euro with solid euro mechanisms, but there's far too much swingy, unbalanced, unmitigated randomness for my tastes.  I could see a game of this where I outplay my opponents and lose because I didn't get enough "good" cards (action cards or mayoral cards).  There isn't a strong enough connection between my actions and the outcome.

I'd play this from time to time, but it is definitely not my cup o' tea.  (I prefer Earl Grey.)

I enjoy the multipurpose cards. The game is a bit to teach people mainly due to the time it takes people to get used to what the icons mean and the reference manual only explaining it for 1 color. It can make looking up the card you need to understand and bit of a pain. But taht aside it is a very good game!

RATING: 7
The epitome of a solid design with no rough edges, yet nothing that stands out as original or particularly interesting.  I suppose the neutral workers are a bit interesting.  They can be used to replace an opponent's workers when control of a tile is being assessed.  The card play also has some interest; there is scope to create some useful combos.   However, those cards do make for highly tactical play, based on the situation at this moment and what the cards allow you to do about it.  Nor does the game develop; your last turn will be similar to your first.  

Production quality is good.  Rather like the game itself, I found the artwork solid but uninspired.

I'd like to play this again. There are too many icons and having to look at the cards every turn means that formulating a strategy is impossible unless you're a veteran at this game. It feels somewhat lumpy in gameplay and the rulebook is not the best - too much omitted.

RATING: 7
A gamers game with a "variable tiles triggered by area majorities" board, driven by cards that can be used for their color, their action, or simply as currency.  The net result is a worthy "gamers' challenge" for fans of euro mechanics, multi-use cards and VP optimization.  Curiously, the game is particularly weak thematically which is a shame, and quite a contrast to Boydell's Snowdonia, which felt wonderfully thematic.

This game has a high "screw your opponent" factor, thus has a big kingmaker problem.  Don't play with anyone you want to maintain a friendship with.

RATING: 6
Area control where you compete for majority on a variety of Guild tiles that make up the board. Each tile has a unique reward for winning control. A hand of multi-function cards are used for special actions or to move liverymen (meeples) onto the tiles. Points are scored by controlling tiles and fulfilling secret victory conditions. 

Variable set-up of guilds makes every game different, but I'm not convinced this drastically changes the "feel" of the game from one play to the next. The flow of cards through your hand greatly dictates what you can do. There is an attack mechanic (called "negotiation" which seems to be a euphemism for punching each other in the head) that allows you to remove other liverymen, making this potentially more aggressive and in-your-face than the average euro. It also makes battles for control somewhat unpredictable.

Comparisons: El Grande meets Bruge, but far less elegant than either of those games. Add the unpredictable and aggressive gun-fights from Carson City, which means you have to be prepared for your plans to be drastically overturned.

This rating is for game play alone, which is not bad but clunky and rough around the edges. Very tactical and opportunistic, with long-term strategy quite fragile to the whims of the cards that fall into your hands. However, it bears mentioning that the rulebook is sorely in need of a competent editor, and missing information from the player aids can only be described as egregious.

Played a prototype version. I found it ok, but it's generally not the type of game I usually enjoy.
- first of all there's very direct interaction due to the area control mechanism (that's fine), but on top of that players have opportunities to collect black cubes/workers that may then be used to knock out another player's cube/worker from a card, to deny him the first or second place over there; inherent mechanisms of the game highly encourage you to take advantage of this, so there will be take-that type of interaction in the game that you need to take into consideration

- you do as much as you can on your turn with the cards you have, it will take some time to optimize a move with, say, 4 cards, but occasionally people have more, and before they go through what they all do, all alternatives... it just takes time

- sometimes the right cards just don't come, you want to win more blue cards, but you don't have any card on hand that would let you exert influence on blue cards

- game end goals can be swingy, on your last turn you might just draw a perfect goal that you just happen to fulfill and scores you 6 points or so

Overall, I had an impression that I can't control the game too much, too many things were dependent on the blind draw and other player's actions. And that's fine, it's just not my usual type of game. I prefer Snowdonia, in which goals are up for grabs and public knowledge all the time, not hidden and drawn blindly. Overall, I think it's a decent title that I may play occasionally, I don't need a copy in my collection though, especially since I think my playgroup will not enjoy it.

Shockingly good game.

This is one of those games that you know you are enjoying it MANY times throughout the game, not just at the end or afterwards.

You can pull off triumphant punch the air moments  and if you manage to pull off some proper good old screwage then you can bet it's not too long that the agony of getting well and truly shafted  is on the horizon.

 makes for an awesome and sometimes hilarious game with a ton of player interaction and very clever interwoven mechanisms.

Tons of replay-ability via variable set up of tiles and card draws.

My brother in law asked "when is this available?" . 
(Hopefully very soon.)

Simply one of the best games I have played in a long time. 

9 is provisional after two games , I can only see it rising.

Very fortunate to get Mr Boydell no less to explain the game to us at Essen 2015. As ever with language independent games, the iconography was a first step to climb to get into the game but the graphics are quite intuitive once the penny drops. Actions are taken from cards held in hand which double as currency to fund more expensive actions. Lots of interaction to compete for guilds and the black cubes introduce a thoroughly evil aspect and opportunity for coercion and backstabbing. A very nice game that demonstrates the benefits of having been play tested thoroughly.

2nd Play: Still needing constant reference to the cheat sheet to work out the icons. Also the font for the tile numbers could be clearer and larger. 3's look too much like 5's upsidedown. A close game with 4 points separating 1st-3rd.

3rd Play: Concern: The last two games have been won by the player who has had the most Mayor cards with the last won at a gallop. The trouble seems at this stage that you can only play with the cards your are dealt and if they don't get you to the guilds that gain the mayor cards and you can't get onto the plantation, you seem to be always gunning for 2nd or 3rd place. Until it's demonstrated that this view is incorrect, my rating is reduced.

Thinking about picking this up. This looks like a fairly interesting multi-use card game. I'm not 100% sure about all of the iconography, but I like the idea of the various combos you can put together on a turn.

Update: I was fortunate enough to have the chance to play this game 4 players. My thoughts:

What I liked: I really enjoyed the multi-use cards, putting together card combos, and the struggle to control your hand limit while still getting things done. There seems to be a large degree of luck here, but if you understand that it can be fun to string together card combos. 

Neutral: I am not really an area control fan and you really need to be one in order to enjoy this game. There really isn’t much new that this game adds to the area majority genre. I also liked and disliked the turn order. Players with more points go first and there is a strong advantage to going last. I sometimes felt that the advantage to going last was too strong, but I did enjoy the impact of turn order on placement of neutral liverymen. The theme really doesn't matter to the gameplay and the iconography takes some getting used to.

Disliked: I did not really care for the neutral liverymen, but I can see how they add a lot to the game.  I personally didn’t like the fact that players not involved in the area majority for a tile can choose to play their neutral liverymen to affect the outcome. It often felt kind of petty and like point grubbing to some extent. The “threat” this element adds to the game is fun, but at the end of the day it doesn’t create a very fun gaming experience when you keep getting hit by something you couldn’t control. If you are a player that doesn’t have the ability to get any of these neutral meeples (through card draw luck) you can be at a significant disadvantage. Also, there was far too much downtime in our game for my tastes. We played slowly for certain, but there are a lot of AP inducing moments in this game. Typically, each player will get almost an entirely new hand each turn. These cards are full of new icons to look at, and it can be difficult to plan your turns in advance due to the changing board state. Overall, what I disliked the most about this was that there is a lot of min/maxing. Players that are last in turn order can see who has neutral liverymen and can plan their turn to ensure that they maximize it. The problem is that this “puzzle” takes a long time to solve and it can be boring for other players at the table to wait for this. Another dislike is the randomness in end game bonus cards. Of course it is advantageous to draw a lot of these, but one player can simply luck into drawing a perfect card at the end of the game by chance. This doesn't feel fun in a game of this length.

In the end, I liked the card play but this isn’t a game I want to add to my collection. I would have greatly preferred the card play in a faster game, but in this game it just overstayed its welcome for me. Couple that to the sometimes petty meanness of the neutral liverymen, randomness from card draw, and the lack of player control in many circumstances means that this is a pass for me. There are lots of other games I would rather play over this one. I’m very glad I played it, because I probably would have blindly bought this one after seeing Rahdo’s runthrough.

Two main mechanics drive this game; Area control(influence) and hand management of effect cards. Effect cards are paid with other effect cards (like in San Juan; You choose which cards are to be used as currency). At the end of the game the one with the most controlled areas (guilds) will probably have the upper hand. Though there are other ways for scoring VPs. There's some luck involved, getting the right colors for gaining control of the areas with the most prospect for you, but that's where the puzzle aspect of combining effects comes into play.

And that's the game's strong part. Combining cards to get the most advantage. Tinkering with possibilities, when to draw extra cards to create more powerful effects, etc. Timing is also important, especially when a sequence of events is about to go off.

It's not all rosy though. The rulebook is needlessly compicated and makes it hard to find specific rules. Some important information is only deduced by reading through it five times. Then there's the iconography; It's an admirable goal to make the game components language independant, but in this case it results in a constant need for looking at the card reference sheet to get the exact workings. That kind of defeats the purpose. When only playing the game once in a while, this adds considerable amounts of play time.

And that's maybe the last gripe; When only occasionally playing this game, you have to reinvent all the possible card combinations which can take a fair bit of downtime, depending on the players.

All in all, the game is a solid design and it's really fun evaluating all the possibilities, it's just failing in the layout and the rulebook.

One play of the prototype at BGG.CON.   Seems to be a relatively solid game, although the prototype does suffer from too much complexity in terms of having to learn with a million different cards do, many with iconography that is not intuitive.   

Once you get around that learning curve though it's a reasonably good game.  Not sure I'd ever choose this over many other games because it doesn't seem to bring much new to the table, but it's in no way a bad game.   I'd certainly give a play of the final polished version.

Mechanic comparisons:

Cube pushing and management like el grande.
Card value and scarcity like Oasis.
Multiple use cards like San Juan.
Theme like Key Market.

Such a shame because I really liked Snowdonia. I could see this being fun after a bunch of plays, but the iconography is incomprehensible and required an agonizing amount of rule checking in the first game. And the way the card powers are laid out in the reference makes it difficult to find anything. It is without a doubt the most frustrated I have been just trying to play a game correctly that I can remember. Forget decent play, I couldn't care less about that at some point. I just wanted it to be over. 

Like I said, there are clever ideas in there for people who want to play half a dozen times and get past the early frustration. But it wasn't good enough to me to make that kind of sacrifice.

An area control game that played in about 90-100 minutes with 3 new players, which is about what I expected to learn the iconography. After some teaching of the icons and reading a few cards, we didn't find it as bad as some have posted here, but it's still a lot between the cards and the tiles. We actually found all of the colors between the meeples and tiles to be a lot to take in each round and made the board extremely busy. The rounds move quick, but I still felt with 3 that 15 rounds was probably 3-5 too many. In addition, the mayor cards can offer a wide variety of swing towards the end so the tiles that offer these cards almost seem the most critical to go after, which heavily influenced the winner in our first game. All in all it's a good game but not one that stands out from other area control games like Five Tribes or Gold West that I enjoy more.

Guilds of London has provided me with the most enjoyable 3p gaming experience I have had in a very, very long time. The negotiation phase (aka the "screwage phase") and the threat of negotiation (aka getting screwed) made this game much more interactive than any of us were anticipating, which we all enjoyed immensely.

Interspersed with this interaction is very clever card play and area control with cascading effects that made for an extremely enriching and rewarding experience.

Bit of a letdown. Honestly this is the pattern I'm seeing from TMG. Games that look nice, have respectable pedigree, but fall a bit short of competing favorably with the best. And there are just too many games to spend time playing the ones that are just ok. Which is a shame, and a bit surprising, as I loved the designer's prior work, Snowdonia. 

Some of the issues are visual. The artist thought that lots of color would be a great idea, but by midway through the game, looking at the board makes me feel like I'm on an LSD trip (not that I'd know, but it's what I imagine).

But the biggest issue is that there is almost zero ability to plan ahead, because what you can do depends on the cards you have, and since everyone's cards are different, you have no idea what others are going to do. And the cards are extremely constraining. The winning strategy seems to be to draw cards with the right colors. 

The game also has one of my pet peeves: The core game rules are so simple that you can explain them in a couple minutes. As such, it's tempting to bring out when you want a game that can be explained very quickly. But the problem is that new people can't understand the cards until they've see a lot / most of them, which takes too long to explain. And there are games with much more interesting rules systems that can explained in that time, if you factor in explaining all the cards.

The player who won our (one and probably only) game disliked the game the most. That's telling.

My waiting has not been in vain (and even earned me a place in the rulebook). My wife and I managed to play a game at Essen when Tony collared me at an opportune moment. Had an absolute blast playing it. It's the sort of game that we enjoy a lot, keeping the cardflow up is essential, the area control is nasty and tense, the decisions interesting and varied. Under strict orders from my wife to obtain this on release.

This is a great game. Essentially an area control game, it uses multi-use cards and has huge replayability due to the random selection and positioning of the guild tiles. It also scales well according to number of players. But what makes it a 10 for me is the addition of an official solo variant.

Tony Boydell games are insta-buys and just plain amazing fun to play.

Arrived June 6!!!!! Probably the first person with a copy in Ontario, if not Canada. Happy dance!!!

Had a copy sent from UKGE in June 2016 via courier three-day delivery. Thanks much to Paul at Gameslore (Birmingham) for helping me out with this. Probably the first copy in Canada?

First 3-player game ... FANTASTIC.
Second 2-player game ... MORE FANTASTIC! (And higher scores)
Third game (three-player) ... WOOT!

On the last turn of the game you'll still be looking up what the iconography on the cards means. It's possible to just play the cards for their generic ability (spawning meeples and moving them), which makes the game move along much better, but at a certain point you start to wonder why the game is even on the table if it's more enjoyable to avoid so much of it.

Was looking forward to playing this and like area majority and combo type mechanisms but I found the first game a little disappointing. 

- Nice theme but there is virtually no engagement with it at all. The graphic design does not help in this regard as the name of the guild tiles is in a small type face so all you are competing for is the icons on the tile.

- The multi-use cards suit/currency/action don't really signify much in terms of the theme. 

- The game doesn't really 'build' - this is mainly due to your hand/position essentially resetting after a turn where you play most of your cards. There is no 'engine' that you develop and no real board-empire that you build beyond some tile adjacency.

-   The VP bonus cards (forget what they are called) are blind fishes for synergistic VP generation and some seem easier to score well from than others.

I was well adrift score wise in the game I played so perhaps a reason why I didn't have a warm feel towards it but I've played enough games to usually discount this when forming an opinion. Would play again but just.

Tony Boydell designed Snowdonia, certainly one of my favourite Euros. Guilds of London is another potential classic from the fertile mind of the man. 

The game is part area-majority (but this is not overwhelming: I am not a fan of area majority but love this game), part card comboing (not deck-building, but playing your hand to the optimum position each turn), and part dickery (there are plenty of opportunities for messing with the opposition).

The game speeds along once you have got used to the cards and what they do. On first play you may find the cards a little overwhelming in their diversity and meaning, but by the second play you will hardly ever have to refer to the player aid, and things roll along very smoothly indeed.

Because your options are determined by your cards each turn then the game is highly tactical. There is not a slow-growing engine developing or a wider story arc, though you do have goals to achieve from your initial cards which set end-game objectives. This fast-moving tactical nature of the gameplay, and the constant changing nature of the game state, is what keeps the game moving and the options varyin such an interesting way on every move. Each turn you draw new cards and each turn you have to work out the best options given the cards in hand. 

What sets the game apart and onto the next level are the 'neutral' meeples. You gain control of these guys via various means and they allow you to mess with the majorities by swapping players' meeples with neutral guys. Hence this part of the game offers up wonderful negotiating opportunities and brings an excellent dimension to the whole gameplay. These neutrals act as a point of real power working both in a nuclear deterrent way (don't mess with my guys or else...), and allowing you to broker deals or simply to kick out your opponents in key areas.

An excellent Euro.

Decent game. Defiantly Ameritrash, trying to disguise itself as a euro. Not particularly fun. VERY SWINGY. Basically you gain points, get in the lead and then can't do anything, so you kinda wait for other people to pass you so you're in last place again so you can win a round. 

A lot of take that mechanics. There are several ways to just negate another players turn. With the black guys, that just return one of your plays home, but worse, because now someone else might gain the tile and benefits. There is a card that just makes someone else lose 2 points, uggggg.... why are game developers so bad at this. 

There is some interesting stuff going on here, but the cards are not at all balanced. The turn order is super punishing. There is to much negative interaction. I guarantee if three people agreed up front the forth could never win this game. You're at other players mercy for the majority of the game. Basically a multiplayer kingmaker fest, if people know what they're doing. 

The guild cards are most likely way overpowered, since turn order is so overpowered, you want to be able to hide points, and guild cards are by far the most effective way to do that. I guess it's a self correcting mechanic in a way, because people will have to fight harder to get them.

I think it's funny that isn't never at it's best, on the title page.

The iconography really hurts this one.  If the icons aren't fresh in memory we'd rather just skip this and play something else, which inhibits re-learning the icons.

This one isn't very likely to get replayed simply due to the icons.  The game is fine, but we'd rather play other things.

About halfway through the first game, you start to understand the iconography, and then start focusing on how to win. Will certainly play again. There are some interesting combos that reveal themselves throughout the game, and I'm quite eager to try more of them out. I must admit that I didn't look up the abilities on each and every card I had on hand, and I think that's a good thing the first time you play. Otherwise, the game would have taken too long.

RATING: 7
Through the use of various card abilities you're tasked to win tiles that award victory points, set up other scoring opportunities, and accelerate card draw.

Despite their lack of theme, I quite enjoy the variety of guild tiles. Especially, as they flip to show their colorful Coat of Arms after scoring.

Overall, the game provides a satisfying mix of card play and area control.

Out of the 11 games I played at Bryce-Con 2018, this is the only one I did not like.   It lasted too long--15 rounds with the last third just dragging.  For the last 4 rounds I had allocated all but 3 of 16 pawns, and so just moved them back and forth with little to do.  I won and came within 2 pts of lapping the board twice, yet there was no 60+ token to place under my score marker as it moved around the board.  I did like several things about the game, the components, the different tile setup of each game, and the neutral liverymen with whom you could really zing an unsuspecting opponent and neutralize the score.   I like games where the winner is a huge surprise to all. The bonus cards revealed at game end zoomed me from an ignored last into the significant lead.  Surprise endings to add fun to a game.

An excellent use of multifunctional cards, forming the backbone of a fun and challenging area control game.

Guilds of London possesses that tantalising quality of presenting options, only one of which can be taken, with the strength or flexibility of the subsequent turn dependent on that choice. The only aspect which prevents me awarding this the full ten, is that there is a propensity for games like this to be AP-prone; but that's only a small point.

Wer von GUILDS OF LONDON Innovation erwartet, der wird glatt enttäuscht werden - dazu war das Spiel in seiner Entwicklungszeit auch zu viele Jahre unterwegs. Auch nach dem Abzug der thematischen Folie "Zünfte" bleiben die ZÜNFTE ein Euro wie er unthematischer nicht sein kann: Zünfte sucht man vergeblich. Dafür findet man viele Plättchen auf denen ein klassisches, taktiertes Mehrheitengerangel steigt, das durchaus einen Kniff hat: spontane Selbstorganisation mit Mini-Kombos bei jedem Zug und ein brutales Kartenmanagement eröffnen ein interessantes taktisches Momentum innerhalb der Spielerreihenfolge: spielt man seine Mini-Kombo, wenn andere "Karten nachziehen" müssen? Portion Glück braucht man auch. Die Gestaltung ist didaktisch: man muss die Ikonographie regelrecht erlernen. Hat man die Hürde nach einer Lernpartie genommen, spielt sich ZÜNFTE zügig, wenn man entscheidungsintuitive Spieler am Tisch hat. Ohne Grübelheinis ist ZÜNFTE ist ein gutes Spiel, das innerhalb der guten Spiele als schnelles gutes Spiel Kategorie GLASSTRASSE seinen Platz finden kann. Denn nicht jeder gute Spieleabend wird durch ein sehr gutes Spiel bestimmt, sondern durch die Menschen, die es spielen. Das kann auch durch ein gutes Spiel geschehen.

Ah, Guilds of London.  At its basics it is a rather intriguing game of area majority and interesting card play.  Actually, it doesn't wholly play like any other game I can think of and it manages to escape a routine "Euro" feel by avoiding the whole "collect these resources and trade them for points" approach that dominates all too much. Anyway, GoL isn't mind-blowing in terms of approach, but it is very satisfying when I consider the type of thinking that needs to be implemented to play well.  And I know this was the designer's true "labour of love" game and it shows.  On all this alone, I rate the game a '7'.  But I almost gave it a '6'.  Why?  I think TMG's approach to physical design is - in most respects - unfortunate.  I get that being language independent is a good cost-cutting measure and without understanding the economics of selling games, I can still understand why they went this way. But the game looks like a bloody, barfy mess of symbols.  Instead of being able to think about your turn in any full way, you feel like you first have to translate everything from Swahili to English. Some symbols are easy to figure out but there are enough cards where the reference sheet is needed.  So now you're holding all this translated information in your head and now trying to manipulate the cards in the right way. It's way too much of an overload.  This issue could have been _easily_ solved by text-driven cards (even if they had to leave the board tiles as symbols to reduce clutter).  Imagine trying to play Agricola or Jambo with symbols only! It would make these two joyful games a huge pain in the ass. That's what's happening here.  TMG should have bit the bullet and gone for text.  The first turn (with 6 cards in hand) is painful to think about and this is only because of the symbols (otherwise the game is very easy to understand, rules-wise).  Yes, it gets better with multiple plays, but it should have been best right from the very beginning.  I like when games get better because you understand their complexities - not because you've become more adept at its symbol-set.  A real misfire on approach, is my thought.  Plus, there are enough spelling/grammar errors in the rulebook to make it feel rushed (was nobody proofreading?!) and some real oversights (NO appendix for the Governor Cards?!?!)

So, was going to give it a '6' but if you forget all about these production misgivings it is a '7'.  I'm going to leave it at a '7' because I think design should be considered over production.  But hot damn, I hope a second edition resolves some of these issues.  (Though I doubt they'll ever do text-dependent cards.)

Very good worker placement game. I think the combination of cards and tiles creates a lot of variety in strategy and tactics from one game to another. 
The opportunity to collect Mayoral end of game scoring cards throughout the game is a nice mechanic that creates a nice unknown element to proceedings. 
Played this in the evening at UK games Expo and all four players really enjoyed and had a good discussion after, directing different  strategies etc.
I would really recommend this for anyone who is a fan of worker placement.

TMG... so quality production.  

Lots of unique cards with some really fun combos and epic chaining moves to pull off on your turn.

I can appreciate the need for a language independent game but when you have this many cards that are (mostly) unique, you really want to use text for ease of play.

Still, the icons make sense and by the end of the first game you can pretty much make out each card beforehand.

It is area control, which is a tough sell for us though.

First play was fun to explore the cards and combos.

This has a couple things I like in games, one of which being multiple use cards, that also double as currency, like San Juan. There is great satisfaction in playing your entire hand, or sneaking in and getting a tile scored quickly. One thing for sure is that this takes more than one play to grok, and there is a lot of iconography. Be sure to print out those reference sheets! Fun game that is very dynamic, although I'm mixed on the artwork and production.

Opinion: liked the game, before playing I have heard that it has too many icons, and they were a bit confusing so you would need too many time reading the meaning of them. Well I agree with part of that, the game has lot of icons, but after a couple of turns you are with them.
Regarding the game, I like games with cards with several uses (hire a guildsmen, move one or apply the effects, as well as using them as coins). You have to control tiles during the game putting your apprentices there, once you reach a minimum number of them, the tile is scored and one of the apprentices become a master.
Quite agile during turns, you have only 7 cards for your turn, and only draw 2 at the end if you play some (with exceptions for combos, yes, the game has lot of combos and this is something I like too), so you have to keep in mind that not all turns you will have many cards.
The idea of the neutral meeples, and how mean they are makes the game also lovely.
In a nutshell, is a game you can explain really fast, take a couple of turns to understand the icons on the cards and then you can play really agile and enjoy all the decisions you have

Boydell strikes back with an Area Control, Card powered, Multi victory condition winner.

Guilds of London is everything we had been waiting for, and more.

It's a close, interactive, variable board game where cards in hand drive actions- but not necessarily points.

Players use their own and neutral meeples to take control of the historic Guilds of London, to become Lord Mayor.

The interactive use of these- the ability to negotiate and even extort- and to drive control of Guild tiles makes for a fascinating game, which varies play to play.

It makes an even better first impression than the very solid Snowdonia.

The first time learning this game, expect it to take 2-4 hours. Iconography is heavy and the player aids aren't helpful in terms of making it more intuitive to figure out.

After getting over the massive learning hump, the game is alright. It can be frustrating not drawing useful cards, but interesting combos can happen. It also seems that at some point everyone ends up with a turn where they can't do anything but draw 4 cards, which is worth knowing about haha.

I wouldn't be opposed to playing it again sometime but would want to play with people who've already played before. Otherwise, I could be playing something like Mombasa with the 2 hours time frame.

This game was a big disappointment for me.  The rulebook is poorly written and the iconography is terrible.  Not what I typically expect from TMG.  Overall, game-play is repetitive and dull as you stack meeples on tiles and occasionally move them in hopes of securely majorities.  Lots of AP.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (February 2017)

Guilds of London is a good Euro game, I really like games in which the cards have multiple uses :D.

The rules aren’t very complex, you can explain them under 16 minutes. Playtime is much more than the advertised 45 minutes, furthermore, when you are learning it as you constantly have to refer to the game aids to see what your cards do. Still, I have a hard time imagining the game ending in about 45 minutes with 4 expert players. Playtime for me was about 150 minutes, with expert players I would guess it can end in about 75 minutes.

The art and components are ok, but nothing that excites me. The icons are functional and you understand them rather quickly.

The theme is also ok.

Best with 3 players, but I would play with any player configuration but solo.

Guilds of London has interesting decisions, basically, how to play your cards to the best effect. You can play cards to recruit people, play people to try to gain the first or second place on a guild, play the effect of the cards (sometimes paying for it) or use them as money to pay for the effect. It seems the game has a lot of replayability and multiple paths to victory.

The luck of the draw is present, but I´m not sure if it impacts the game negatively. I need more plays to verify if it is too much or, as I suspect, it can be mitigated with clever play. I think you always have something interesting to do, no matter which cards you draw, however, sometimes you do need the correct color of cards and you just simply don’t have it.

As with most area control games, going last is a huge advantage so having the player who has the least VPs going last is a good balancing mechanism. 

Guilds of London has some “take that” elements that I don´t enjoy much. Also the black meeples can be used to attack someone, they are very powerful and mean.

Bottom line, Guilds of London offers a mix of strategy (goal cards) and (mainly) tactics with very interesting decisions in each turn. The first game will be very slow because each player has to refer to the aid often. I think Guilds of London will be a keeper for me, but I need more plays to see if this is the case. It is a borderline 7.0 for me right now.

2017-07-10 - There's nothing wrong with this area control game. It's a little too abstract, and a little icon heavy, but those aren't knocks against it really. It just didn't really distinguish itself in my one play. I would play it again, but I'm not in a hurry to do so.

Tiles are placed randomly around the Guild Hall. Then, using the cards you've been dealt, summon workers to the guild, place them on tiles, or pay to use the special abilities the cards -- all with the goal of winning control of those tiles BUT you don't know what gives you the victory points until you check the cards that give you score points. More tiles come at various scoring points during the game. Basically, it's worker placement but with the added catch that, add the end of the game, your victory score conditions can shift the numbers. It seems daunting, but picks up quickly.

PLUS: easy to grasp, plenty of opportunity to interfere with opponents, unknown victory factors
MINUS: theme isn't fully integrated, black needles aren't easily understood, not every card is on the reference (you have to find similar ones)

Bought it at origins, and sold it the same day.  If you think the iconography in race for the galaxy is bad you will hate this game (i love race).  The basic rules are 1/2 page, but all the cards break all the rules.  Cheat sheet helped but every turn we had to study the cheat sheets to figure out what the hell we could do which created massive AP and downtime.  Even players who never take long took forever to figure out every move.  End game scoring cards seemed to have balance issues in 2 player, Some had some tough conditions that were underpowered for what they demanded.  Lots of random stuff that can be somewhat solved but it just added to the ap.  If someone played this ten times with their group and comitteed to playing the game a lot all the ap and cheat sheet scouring would go away but i dont want to play this game that much.  Its not a terrible game and I had fun playing it, but i think it is just a bit too cleaver for its own good and the elegance is trumped by cleaver.  I can see how some will love this game so take  my review with a grain of salt.  I would play it again but i wont be buying it and i will never play this game with people who are heavily prone to Ap because the downtime would make the game four hours of frustration.  I would buy it again if two things happened.  They would make different end game bonus scoring cards for the two player game, or adjusted scores for it (moving some cards to being worth more points), and if they printed the cheat sheet text on the cards.  Then I think this would be instantly a easier game to get to the table.  Its frustrating because Tony seems like a great guy, the game seems solid, I like TMG games and was excited to see the game sell out but some of the people I play with would never want to play games with me again if I made them play this one.

Played a prototype copy at BGG Con 2015. I was excited to try it, but it really was annoying to play. An extremely generic theme and artwork which doesn't seem to have been greatly improved for the official release, but I'm not too concerned with that.

It's just the iconography and complexity of every single card that comes out greatly slows down the game - the amount of rules consultation (and we are not rules lawyers) was unbearable. I admit that as you learn the game the enjoyment would probably increase, but the initial learning curve was steep enough that it did not leave a positive first impression. And it's sad to say, but in today's game-saturated market, that's enough for me to walk away.

I'm in love with the multi-use card system, mixed with the double-draw after passing for a turn, and the timing of tile evaluation, which forces you to balance mega turns with opportunities. I love the extra draw cards, the passive powers, and trying to combo these the best you could. I also really enjoy the adjacency bonuses, the way to city grows without just becoming a bigger square, and the Mayor bonus objective cards.

Rating may chance after few more games. For now ( played only 3 games > 4p ; solo and 3p ) I don't know for sure. Maybe i had expected too much ( 3 years working and Snowdonia ) but the first I played was a real disaster. Much to long, thanks to the downtime because of the iconography and some interpretation of the rules ( and a way to slow player) But after playing with good gamers i see the flow of the game, the take that aspect, good area control, nice way to play your cards. victory is much more then getting the good cards, it's about seeing the opportunities on the good moment, making combo's... will see what the future brings.

I love the idea of the game, however it suffers the same problem as blue moon city - It's a "strategic" game which has a massive luck and swing factor. I think it tries to nail on the somewhat random but strategic nature of terraforming mars but falls to far on the random side and misses the mark. Still a fun experience, if a little long due to the overly random nature.

When I heard this game combined area control and multi-use cards I had to get it. Always love the tough decisions that come from cards that can be spent for a variety of actions and Guilds of London didn't disappoint in this regard. You want to make the most of each hand of cards and it can be a really tough decision how to best use each card. The area control can definitely be harsh, there will be direct conflict in this game and that may not appeal to some. Very cool game with lots of variety in end-game scoring options and variability in what guild tiles come out each game. The only real issue is learning the iconography, but printing out the detailed card list player aid helps alleviate this because you can just look up the card number and read what it does, I wish the included player aid was better in this regard. But by the end of the first game most players are comfortable with the iconography. I followed the development of this game on BGG and very glad to have a copy of this now.

Sad to read the coda about only three of forty Worshipful Companies giving their permission to use the name and shield in the game (and a bit shocking that the Worshipful Company of Makers of Playing Cards weren't among them). Game was a lot of what I'd hoped it would be from the theme, but having to constantly look up the exact meanings of the card and tile icons in an opaque rulebook was so exhausting that we knocked it on the head after eight rounds.

From the designer of Snowdonia (therefore worth a look) this is one of those games that through abstraction becomes thematic. Each guild is a square tile. You construct a board of 25 then seek dominance of each through meeple power. It is area control but certainly through the Ricky Royal / Tony Boydell 'Boris' bot you feel as if you are assembling electoral colleges against a powerful opponent to exert influence. Uses a hand of cards to activate moves, a favourite mechanic. Neat, puzzly, clever.

RATING: 7
Initially over whelming due to the wide variety of diagrams and the way one card can be used in three ways but once you get used to the imagery, it makes sense. AP can rear it's head when you've a full hand size but doesn't take too long even with 4 new players. The biggest negative is the bonus point cards, which are drawn through the game, can swing the scores too much and make the rest of the game fairly fruitless. The best aspect is the catch-up mechanic which punishes players for taking a lead ,ensuring that the pack stay fairly close together.

AfIter a few plays, the downtime proved to be too much and I moved it along.  I also wonder if there is really much battling that occurs in this game for tiles - I think one chooses a few battles and chooses a couple second places in general. 

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Not quite certain what to think after a four player game of the prototype. The game is very tactical in nature although one does need to keep long range goals in mind. The game involves area majority and benefits for first and second once a condition has been met. Going later allows for greater sense of board state but may also result in difficulty in overtaking majorities (or cost being not worthwhile). Can be difficult to go after desired guilds as cards of appropriate color are needed and you may not have drawn them. Also, the cards have quite a few different abilities and icons and will take some time to understand what all do. Fun, but the game is fairly chaotic.

RATING: 6
I liked Guilds of London, though there's a lot of downtime since we all had AP. Cards require a lot of referencing, especially for new players. Lots of interesting decisions and vying for majority all over the changing modular board. I always love multi-use cards, particularly when the cards are currency for other cards, so you have to agonize over what to give up. The 2nd place rewards are very well done and ensure that there's interest in a guild tile even if one player is dominant there. Watch out for those neutral liverymen. They can knock you out of contention for guild scoring.

For a game that was suppose to focus on area majorities I felt like it never gave you any reason to challenge other players and more often than not you were better off claiming first on another unoccupied tile. That being said I was happy to try this one out...so I could realize I needed to cancel my preorder.

The game didn't seem like much on paper. As I started to play, it seemed like a more complex Blue Moon City (which is not a bad thing). This point alone kept me wanting to know more.

After playing, what you have is an intense majorities game, that with use of neutral pawns, becomes a serious tactical experience. There are so many ways to approach the game thanks to being able to basically move anywhere. I think it's going to be a regular for the balance of weight and length, much like Istanbul is.

In an age where most think medium weight games aren't getting it done, this is one of the few doing it exactly right.

Seemed right up my alley - area control and multi use cards are elements of games that I enjoy.  I even managed to watch all of the first part of Rahdo's run through and part of the extended play (normally fast forward a bit and only watch a tiny portion) and I was convinced I would love it.

1st play: Not so much love.  Will try again, but I'm not sure this is one that will stay on my shelf.  The decisions weren't super interesting and I felt that my card draws weren't doing me any favors.  Icons were a little annoying, but I think those will be easy to digest after a couple of games.

I will say maybe part of the disappointment was due to me being convinced not even 12 hours before that I was going to love the game after watching Rahdo's playthrough and then having to struggle a bit to find any sort of rhythm in the game.  That's why I'm not writing it off quite yet.

2nd play:  Quite a bit more enjoyable.  Still hoping for a bit more manipulation with the special powers.  Probably still learning how best to play.

Rules are not complex, but heavy iconography gets in the way (as in Grand Austria Hotel). Game drags on as each of the 15 rounds feel the same. I thought at first there would be greater weight in deciding how many cards to play per round (as in Taj Mahal), but it's fairly easy to get additional card draws, removing some potential tension. I'm generally not a fan of area control either, so this game doesn't do much for me.

A good card driven fight for majorities on tiles. Multiple use of many, many different cards. Development of this game has taken a while, but it has become good. Many points are in the end of game points-cards. Just half a point deducted because it takes a bit long (2 hours, 3 pl.) for the depth it offers. But I do enjoy this type of old fashioned area control games.

I found this game extremely annoying. First is the classic complaint: the symbology is epicly bad. We had to open two copies of the game to keep us in reference sheets.

Beyond that, though, I never felt the game rewarded fun play. The player who wins tiles by himself, playing out his hand and drawing every other turn, seems to be in the better position. Spreading your men out with slow play in an attempt to win second place in multiple places means you draw fewer cards, play fewer actions, and leave yourself vulnerable to sniping from neutral pieces.

Little interaction, great frustration, rewarding of un-fun play, not for me.

A very nice card driven area control game where you have to find the best way to combo the hand you are dealt with the guilds in play. The flexibility of the multiple ways you can use the cards negates the luck of the draw nicely meaning strong play is rewarded.

I've played with my family as well as my friends and now we play the game in around 90 minutes.

If you enjoy El Grande and would like a bit more meat on your bone but in a shorter play time than Dominant Species give this a go!

Edit: Regarding the screwage comments from some players. This game is nowhere near as mean as either of the two games mentioned above. You have far more control at preparing your position in this game than you do from a swingy card revealed in El Grande on the Glaciation in Dominant Species.

I enjoyed [b][GameID=119432][/b] so much that buying another game from this designer was a no-brainer.  Then I started hearing the early buzz about this game, that it was COMPLETELY different than the aforementioned title, incorporating a mechanic (area control) that is not my favorite.  Still I resolved that the game would be mine.  Then I bought it and played it solo, and the doubts grew.  It seemed very vanilla, very "is that all there is?"  And the iconography...well, that dead horse has been beaten.  Then I introduced it to my gaming group, and it went over like a lead balloon.

I was hesitant to try this game after reading about the supposedly dreaded iconography, but as a fan of Blue Moon City, multiple use cards, and area control, the temptation was too great to give it a try. I'm glad I did. This is basically a super advanced Blue Moon City. Every game presents a new series of possibilities. You have to adapt to a variety of changing in game circumstances. Yet there is some strategic thinking in determining the sections of the board to visit. You have to determine whether to score big on the board or go after Victory Bonus cards that may or may not be helpful. Possibly, you will draw a card that's perfect for your situation. That may be too random for some. This is a card game and there is some luck involved. The challenge is how to mitigate the random factors. There is plenty of interactivity as you assess whether to dominate a tile, leave it available for a second place meeple, and how you choose to use your so-called neutral (and powerful) pieces, and when to go after them. I found the iconography problem to be non-existent. However, you must download the BGG file that lists the cards by number. After a few games the icons become second nature. If you're familiar with Race to the Galaxy the iconography here is a walk in the park.

Further plays will determine exactly how much variety there is and whether my ranking will go up. I've only played GOL at the two player count and I've very much enjoyed it as a colorful, challenging, but not overwhelming, evening game that you can play in an hour.

Update: I returned to GOL after a month long rest and I found that I had to look up the icons all over again. On further play I found the 2 person game more tedious and less interesting. The game is missing a certain sharpness and excitement. Hence I've downgraded the rating. It's overly complex for the game playing reward.

This is another great multi-use card game. It plays like a cross between Race for the Galaxy (for the hand management, card play and LARGE number of icons to learn)and Smash-Up (for the area control that 'pop's locations). People can become a little AP prone which will prolong the game, but the turn structure and round system is very clever and it's very satisfying to 'trigger' locations for scoring/claiming. Has many different way to spread your point scoring as well which can lead to an interesting end game and makes it hard to easily predict the winner.

From a hand of cards, you use them for 3 possible actions: hire more liveryman, move a liveryman or use the cards special ability paying the cost. When you move liveryman, you are vying for control of tiles, where only first or second get rewarded.  Some rewards include mayor cards, which give you endgame scoring bonuses. 

Each turn you are trying to maximize the number of cards in your hand for next turn, while trying to score points.  What slows the game down is trying to figure out the card's special ability. It is not easy to tell from the icons. We missed that the mayor cards had an english description that didn't match any of the icons on the card.

I want to like the game, but it takes away from the game having to constantly refer to two reference sheets and four players wanting to see them. It didn't play that quick for us as some people were trying to optimze, and they took  a lot of time doing so.  Having said that, I would give it a go again, I think it can be decent as you struggle to make do with your cards from round to round.

This game takes symbol decoding just a little bit too far.  If we haven't played the game in awhile we have to relearn what all of the action cards do.  Also, and it's a slight nitpick, but I don't like a lot of the Mayoral goal cards.  I won't go so far as to say they aren't balanced, but a lot of them seem arbitrary or hard to accomplish while others mesh right in to any strategy.  

If you play the game enough and you didn't have to look up action card abilities I'd give the game an 8.  If I overlooked both that and the goal cards I'd give the game a 9.

I'm not a huge fan of area control, but the brilliant card system in this game keeps me wanting to play it more and more.  Two-player games are fast and low-luck given that the layout is known at the start.  The neutral liverymen add another dimension to the decision space.  Hidden end game scoring.  Love it.  My wife won the first game and immediately wanted to play again.  Well-done Mr. Boydell.  Thumbs way up from my wife and me.

The multi use cards and the management of them, the combinations and then getting your liverymen to be the majority in a guild tile is a really interesting game.

There's enough take that, using the neutral liverymen, to really make it unsure that you've won a tile.

And forcing the turn order based on the current scoring leader is a really nice catch up mechanism.

--- Preliminary thougts ---

I have not played the actual game, all the following could not be true.

Guilds of London is quite appealing. It includes mechanisms I love (modular board, multipurpose cards...), some others I don't like that much (area control), and most of all, there seems to be a huge array of strategic and tactic possibilities that lead to meaty decisions.

There are 2 "catch-up" mechanisms I'm not convinced about:
-> The order of play is from the first to the last player in points. This gives all the players a chance to undo whatever the leader did in his turn. 
-> The negotiation is very powerful. True, there are very few neutral liveryman, but they are way powerful and they are deem to cost dearly to the target. And chances are the target will be the first player.

Also, I'm not convinced about the reward cards, I think they might create unfair situations when 2 players are provided with similar goals. Not only they will have a much harder time fullfilling their goal (true, it's just some points, not the game), it will also make the fight over certain guilds in the board while the third (and fourth) peaceful player will benefit.

Now, all these things stop being "issues" for me in a 2-player game. The catchup mechanisms are nor 2vs1 or 3vs1, but 1vs1 and it is now a fair game, the confrontation in reward cards does not favour a third player... I think Guilds of London will excel as a 2-players game.

It would be great if a single game can actually be finished in 45 minutes. It does seem quite thinky to me and probably prone to AP because it offers so many options, at least in the first gameplays.

Right now I have enough 2-players games waiting to be played. Maybe in the future.

Non mi ha convinto per nulla questo gioco di Tony Boydell. Saranno i troppi sinboli, sarà la mancanza di ambientazione, saranno tante cose ma il tutto mi è parso noioso, ripetitivo e con un king making un po' fastidioso. Gioco che si lascia giocare e che da altri amici è stato apprezzato. Io invece l'ho trovato poco interessante e sicuramente molto costoso per quanto offre.

A cross between card engines and area control, Guilds has been a long time in the development, but was definitely worth the effort, especially in the low-luck 2P variant. I can't say I'm mad keen on the iconography, and there is potential to get left behind early on, but the presentation is beautiful and several steps up on anything else Tony Boydell has done.

[b]Guilds of London[/b] 

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (10 -> [b]10[/b]):[/COLOR]

[i]I am happy that I've managed six plays of GoL considering I haven't played with my family. Almost everyone I've introduced GoL to has enjoyed the game; a few people found the iconography too difficult to learn. 

I still find GoL to be a fascinating game to explore; there are so many ways to approach the game due to the diversity of cards and guilds. One aspect I want to touch on are the mayoral reward cards which provide different end game scoring goals. While it is very important to collect some mayoral reward cards, scoring well on a few is just as viable an option as going all out and collecting a bunch. There to be enough ways to score points in the game that I haven't seen one dominant strategy emerge. 

Tony Boydell has knocked it out of the park again with GoL and if you are a fan of multi use cards and area control then this game was designed for you. I'd go further and say the mechanics of GoL play out differently than other area control games and may appeal to a wider audience.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (10):[/COLOR]

[i]Take my two favorite games, El Grande and Race for the Galaxy, smash them up and you get Guilds of London. This game was amazing and I can't wait to play it again. The combination of multi use cards with an ever changing board for area control creates an innovative play experience. As with any area control game player interaction is high, this is not a game for the feint of heart. I would love to own this, but I'm not sure how often it'd get played. That probably won't stop me from buying GoL, it was that good. Will mostly likely end up in my top 10 new to me games of the year.[/i]

I think it was because one of the words was the title of my favorite game, London, which made me buy this game so fast, without even looking at the mechanics. Any game with London in the title is bound to be a straight-laced Euro, area-majority, Victory-point-based, card-drafting, etc. And this game is! It's not exactly a revelation in gaming but I did enjoy my time. The two-player version seemed a bit dull to me, but maybe the mechanics work better with more competition and aggression. Overall, a good game but nothing surprising or inventive.

RATING: 6.8
This game has an interesting and somewhat unusual Area Control mechanism but it's not really enough to make it a great game. After first try I felt it was a little too much repetition for too many rounds. I liked the game at first, but after 8-10 rounds it felt like a long way to the end at 15 rounds (3 players). Scoring cards at the end of the game is more important than scoring tiles during the game.

RATING: 5
Guilds of London offers some interesting card play built around an area control game with a modular type board.  Your first couple games will be an icon nightmare that is worse than Race for the Galaxy.  The icons are not as intuitive as Race and will require more consulting the rulebook during play.  But the icons do become smoother after a game or two.  The card play itself is the "Glory to Rome" style multiple uses for cards genre.  I don't like the card play here as much as games like San Juan or Race because the cards you play are gone after every turn and hence you never feel like you are progressing.  When the game is laid out on the table, it looks like a game where gaining control of guilds in the growing city of London means progressing economically, but it doesn't.  When you gain control of a guild, you get a mediocre one off reward like "4 points and hire a liveryman".  The only ongoing effect, other than potential end game scoring, is that it may help you break ties on neighboring guilds when they are scored.  It never felt like anything you gain throughout play was worth the effort of puzzling through all the cards and icons. Occasionally, you will come across a really cool ability on a card, but then the discard cost to activate the ability is so high that the net effect was not much (if at all) better than playing the cards for their generic default abilities.  I will just stick with RftG and San Juan.

RATING: 6
Guilds of London is a fast-moving area control game that utilizes multi-function cards.  Players can either discard cards to add pawns to the guildhall (active supply), use the flag on the cards to place their pawns on a specific guild, use the special ability of the card, or pass their entire turn to draw extra cards.  Once all players have gone, tiles are evaluated to determine if they have the minimum number of pawns to score, and if they do, points and other bonuses are awarded to first and second, and that tile flips over and will never score again.  One of the possible rewards are goal cards, which score at the end of the game.  This is important because in-game score affects your turn order, and like in many area control games, you definitely want to go last.  This is an extremely tactical game with little in the way of turn-to-turn strategy.  Most players will make sure to meet the threshold on tiles they start placing on, so placed pawns generally don't last until next turn.  Because of this, only players later in the turn order will get to jump in and claim second places, as you don't know where the later players will go.  I found that a lot of the strategy really depends on what cards you happen to draw, and cards that let you draw more cards for next turn are particularly strong, as otherwise you'll have to skip your turns to draw cards at many points in the game.  Additionally, the game has some take-that elements which left a bad taste in my mouth.

I want to like this game, the theme and art work are great, but I just don't. It's too complicated and the complexity feels like it's there for the sake of being complicated, not for adding anything to the game play. Everything seems to be a one off, or a special case. It has the feel of a game that got through a play test or two but missed the refining stage before going into production.

Played the prototype according to the rules version 8.1. 

I like this game: turns are fast and everything is straightforward. But I hope they do invest in some nice artwork like Snowdonia, that the game will need, or it will look to dull.

Edit 27/03/2016: played the pre-production copy of Surya and Myriam. They changed the text on the cards into icons, but they are a bit too much icons for my taste. It makes that a first game will be very slow as everybody has too look up what your cards do all the time. Repeated play will solve this issue off course.

The hand management/multi-use card aspect of this game is brilliant, if a bit hampered by some questionable iconography decisions.  The area control game it governs is just okay, though.  (So basically my 8 rating is combining a 9.5 for the hand management and a 6.5 for the area control.)

RATING: 9.2
Guilds of London is a brilliant area control game based on one of my favorite mechanisms, multi-use cards. My rating here is based entirely on the solo mode, which I have found to be very tight and challenging. I anticipate that my rating will be comparable for the multiplayer game, but I imagine that it will be some time before I can get this to the table with my gaming group. The hurdle is that the cards and tiles have abilities that are represented with a very complex and intimidating system of iconography. The icons are so complex, in fact, that they require a 2 page cheat sheet to decode! Once a person becomes more familiar with the icons, they do become more intuitive. But even 6 games in, I'm still forced to reference the cheat sheets semi-regularly. Nevertheless, if a person is willing to put in the effort to decode the icons, the reward is tremendous!

I was very excited for this game and I enforced Ron to read the rules at the con. I knew the game to be area control, I didn't know it would be very much take-that. I only played the one time and really need to play it again to give a full report but in my one play I liked it and want to play again soon. The rulebook was a bit of a mess and difficult to navigate though. Needs a smaller player aid. Iconography is rough to learn. Overall beautiful game and I hope to enjoy more plays soon. Be prepared for a VERY mean game. Perhaps there should be a few variants that allow for the neutral dudes to be nicer and not so harsh. Definitely not a game for the light-hearted.

RATING: 7
This is an area majorities game, where the trick of things is that each area only scores once a set number of player pieces land in that zone. Then, the leader gets a cool benefit, and 2nd place gets some stuff. The game also gives you benefits for lining up contiguous chains of scored tiles. The iconography is a bit much, it helps to print out some extra player aids from bgg. That being said, this game really stuck in my head. Knowing when to jump into regions, or which player to punch and when, creates a good decision space. The problem is that my playgroup felt like this game gave too many benefits for players who had won previously, so it became points for having points, and the take-that and flip-luck aspects were too much.

Card drafting area control game. With a max hand of 7 cards per turn you're trying to put your workers on tiles to get vps for majority, slight conflict element with players holding neutral workers which they can use to kick your meeples off. Slight catchup as the last player gets to go last, and determine which tile they want to win, but it's not too strong. There is some luck with the cards though, especially with the end game scoring cards.

The problem is that the first play is a right royal pain in the butt. It doesn't need to be, but with the mass of icons hitting you in the eyeballs, it just is. So if you're playing this with a group that's played it before maybe once or twice you're going to find a good game in there. But that first play will turn a lot of first time players off forever. Pity, because it's a good area control game that CAN move along at a swift pace once everyone is familiar with the icons. The rules are dead simple and easy to read and teach. Use of the cards is simple, but what you do with them is a lovely open puzzle of planning and reacting and scheming.

Maybe I'll do something crazy and put all the card text on the reference sheets into pasteups and slide them into the card sleeves. Then I think people would enjoy their first game a lot more and come back happily for a second. It's not that the icons are bad, but there's just so much people can take in at once.

(edit: 10/16) Rating up a point for the 2p game which is brilliant.  More players increases the randomness rather than the chaos, which is a shame, but it still works really nicely.  But the 2p game distils everything perfectly.  

Whilst I'm not usually a fan of combo-rific games, the tension here involved in trading off powerful cards for superficially less-powerful actions is really interesting often enough to keep your attention.
The iconography is quite smooth once you have played a few rounds, although it is at RftG levels of complexity at times.  There are some issues with the rulebook, which doesn't always cover all the terminology sufficiently, but they feel very minor.
Timing is everything - and don't underestimate the Plantation...

If you like tight, well integrated themes then GoL is not for you! The theme is not so much pasted on as left out altogether. HOWEVER - the game is very good, and once I overcame my initial disappointment at the almost complete absence of theme, I enjoyed the game immensely. And despite the abstract nature of the game, I still found myself googling items like the worshipful company of paviors and so on, so my intrigue in the game title wasn't wasted. Unease with the complexity of the iconography has been expressed in some places. In reality, my group had hardly any issues with this, and the symbols became second nature quite quickly.

Don't expect to learn much (or anything) about Guilds, but do enjoy a real brain burner in this rather excellent game.

A conservative 8 to start with, only because I found the amount of tiles to keep track of to be quite a lot.  Good stuff with room to improve.

This is a fun game of hand management and area control! Unfortunately, there are a huge number of icons and they are not presented on the player aid in anything close to a useful way! 

The board is constructed of a random selection and arrangement of building tiles. Players get a handful of cards, each of which can be used for a wide variety of actions (draw cards, get/place/move meeples, etc.). On your turn, take as many actions as you like. Then, draw 2 cards (or 4 if no actions were taken). Also, evaluate all tiles that have at least as many meeples as the tile minimum: majority holder and 2nd place get the indicated bonuses (points, powers, end-game scoring cards, etc.). Ties are broken by control of orthogonal tiles. Control also gives you some power. The winner flips the tile and leaves one meeple there (others are returned to supply). The other players' meeples go to an available pool. There is one interesting (annoying?) twist: before evaluating a tile, players on that tile who also have collected neutral meeples choose, in turn order, whether or not to replace any meeples with neutral ones. The neutral workers are counted towards tile majorities!

There's a bit more: the board grows every few rounds, and additional points are awarded at the end for score cards and for control of adjacent tiles. But once you take a few turns, the game runs very smoothly. Except for those damned icons!! I rarely play a game repeatedly so I'd have to look those icons up constantly, on that oh-so-terrible player aid! Maybe if there's a deluxified version of this some day, I'll look again ....

This is an area control game that someone pointed out shares some mechanics with Smash Up.  Each guild is represented by a tile and players move their meeples onto different tiles, when they reach a certain population they are resolved and the first and second place controllers get points and other bonuses.

One of my favorite mechanics is in this game and that is using cards for multiple purposes.  These cards can be used in 3 (technically four different ways).  Any card can be discarded to hire a new meeple onto the board.  Cards of matching colors can move meeples onto matching tiles.  And finally cards each have a special power that can be played for a cost (cards are discarded to pay these costs making the technical fourth method).

I like that there appears to be a lot of opportunity for player interaction but my first play was kind of nice.  I would love to see how it feels with a little bit more "mean-ness".

I don't think it looks great though.  I found out after playing this is the same designer as Snowdonia, the guy makes boring looking games.  And if you are afraid of iconography this has quite a bit of it that can scare people away.

Rules are easy to learn (but with some unfortunate gaps) - it's the myriad of cards with a dizzying array of befuddling symbols that provide the game's complexity (making it hard to get into). 

Abstract theme that is completely pasted on, so don't expect any sort of thematic experience here. This release epitomizes the concept of a soulless euro - I wasn't engaged at all.

The card play is somewhat clever, with the special abilities giving the game some much-needed life, but the bland design falls completely flat otherwise. There's no substance to this design whatsoever. 

My group generally did not like the game. What a huge disappointment.

Very good area control game with a combination of card play combo's and tile combo's that you can enjoy putting together.

A small? amount of screwage in the form of neutral workers and iconography that like Race for the Galaxy, means looking at the crib sheet often on your first play through, but by your 3rd play I suspect you may only occasionally glance at it.

Nice use of in game points to determine turn order and end game bonus points. I can see why it topped the hotness for a while.

An excellent area control game that uses a card driven engine to provide the manipulation of the board state and player interaction. Card combos drive fast paced changes in the game, and lots jostling for position (it can be better to finish second in some guilds). Turns are quick, so once players are familiar with the game it should clock in around 60-75 mins with 4 players.

The modular about of the board means there is lots of replayability and the vibrant artwork shines through and makes the iconography clear and easily identifiable once you're familiar with it.

Area control game using cards to move your meeples.  
Very simple game that could be taught in a few minutes is hampered by the most iconography I've seen since Race for the Galaxy. The icons aren't that bad, there is just so much of it...All the iconography makes the game a hard sell to new players and puts them off immediately. 

Is the gameplay any good though? is it even worth learning all the icons? I'd say, no. 
The game is rather boring, abstract and very mechanical. Simply put, the game is not worth the effort of learning all the icons, then going through the slog of teaching others while listening to everyone moan and groan as the icon cheat sheet is passed constantly around the table. 

What really puzzles me is why this game had so much hype running up to it's release at Gencon...Maybe because of Tony Boydell being the designer? I dunno, but I imagine many others bought this thinking it was 'must have' and ended up very disapponted.

Thanks Gencon hype train!!!

Guilds of London is a mediocre euro that doesn't do anything groundbreaking.  There are a whole bunch of guild tiles and you are basically just moving your meeples to try to get majority on the guild tiles.  However, there are plenty of tiles, so you rarely need to fight with other people for the majority.  Also, while each tile is different, the differences are fairly minor such that you can almost always find another tile that does the same effect.

The hand management was pretty good - similar to Race for the Galaxy or San Juan where you pay for cards by discarding other cards.  There are hidden scoring cards (which I like) and there are abilities to get more of the hidden scoring cards during the game (which I really like).

I have two major gripes.  First is the iconography.  There are a lot of icons and we were constantly looking up what the cards do.  But the worst part is that they weren't consistent with their icon usage, and sometimes it wasn't clear even after looking up what the card did.  For example, there is one icon that means "at the end of your turn", but on one card it actually means "at the end of the round," which makes a huge difference!  I could see how the icons make it quicker to play after you have a couple plays under your belt, but it made our game take close to 3 hours.

My second gripe is the turn order.  It uses a Power Grid approach where the person with the most points goes first and the person with the fewest points goes last.  The difference between first and last is enormous in this game.  And while I like the mechanic in Power Grid, it doesn't work here because of the end game scoring.  I completely dominated the game because I stayed in last place the whole game.  But while in Power Grid you need to jump ahead to win the game, that is not the case here since half of my total points came from end game scoring.    I was technically "in last place" for the last 3/4 of the game, yet everyone knew I was going to win with about 1/4 of the game to go.

I could see this getting better with repeat plays, but it didn't do enough on the first play for me to want to play it again.

A fine game of area majority, hand management and dickery. It takes at least a play to become familiar with the iconography so with new players it takes a lot longer than the box says. That said, most of the icons are quite logical. I'm not a big fan of area majority games but the card play makes me want to play it nonetheless.

Yes...the icons take a bit of getting used to BUT there's only 15 or so to get your head around and then if you 'read' them off the card (in order) it's almost cartouche-y!

Yes...the neutral liverymen can seem mean BUT you do get to see who has them at all times! "Don't be bullied!" is what I'd say!

Yes...the two player version is different because it's a fixed structure BUT given so many elements trigger off colour (especially the scoring cards), the vagaries of chance (the turning up - or not - of the Guilds with the right, needed colours) shouldn't decide the one-on-one experience! Thus, ALL the Guilds you both need to worry about are there at the start for 'planning'!

Yes...the solo game is hard BUT beating Boris is much more satisfying because of it!

Yes...I am the game's designer and I've given it a 10 BUT how could you love a game if the designer didn't love it MORE?

Yes...some of you love it and some hate it BUT, regardless of your ultimate opinion, thanks for spending time with it in the first place!

GoL is an area majority game that uses a multi-purpose card system to drive action selection. Each card has multiple one-time use functions such as performing special actions, hire a liveryman at the guildhall or moving your liveryman to different guilds. The game is solid but not entirely novel. It is relatively complex and thinky but can also be chaotic.

The fun in GoL is trying to figure out the optimum strategy to efficiently move your liveryman to the correct location to score the guilds. In a smart move, the designers also included a randomly assigned chit to award the second place majority holder with a bonus. This random assigned chit is important as it makes the tile a bit more varied for game play. I was initially worried that with some weaker secondary powers, only the majority holder will be contributing to the tile and that can bog the game down. However, that didn't happen as often as all tiles are nearly resolved at each stage of the game. In fact with 4 players, all tiles were claimed before new tiles were introduced every 3rd round. In the end, fighting of tiles rarely happens primarily because of the threat of black neutral pieces coming into play or the fact that you really need the right cards to play your liveryman on the tiles. This makes the game more chaotic.

The one issue I didn't enjoy as much is the iconography and the amount of variety in the special powers in the action cards, guildhalls and mayoral power cards. For the first few games, a cheat sheet has to be provided to reference the special action powers. Without the sheet, the game is frustrating. However, like all other games, repeated plays will make this easier. Still, I pretty much had to use the reference sheet each and every time I drew new cards. 

GoL is a solid design by Tony Boydell. I enjoyed my play and look forward to the next. I note that the game CAN become quite cutthroat and aggressive once all the mayoral cards are known.  The black neutral liveryman is a curious piece as the threat of negotiation can really prevent someone from fighting for a location.

The symbology is absolutely horrible. I almost wish the game wasn't good, so I didn't have to struggle with teaching this to new players. However, it's a pretty solid area control game under the surface. This won't be intuitive or even particularly fun for first or second timers, but I would say it's worth the effort.

Guilds of London hits a lot of good notes. Multi-use cards, interesting multi-layered area control, brutal player interactions, and huge combo potential in the cards. All of this exciting stuff and the game does it all very well.

Unfortunately, it is buried beneath an absolutely ridiculous amount of obtuse iconography. None of it is intuitive. Worse, many times an effect will repeat under multiple colored cards...but the card glossary only shows one of the possible colors. So when you go to look for "green arrow pointing to a red square." You may miss the "green arrow pointing to the blue square" listing, which stands for both of them. This might not sound that bad, but there are literally 40 unique effects per side of the cheat sheet. This brings every turn to a screeching halt when a big pile of new cards are drawn by a player.

I have no doubt that repeat plays make this quickly fade into irrelevance, much like it did with Race for the Galaxy. The problem, is that while Race has lots of card text to supplement the symbols and facilitate learning them, Guilds of London has no such thing. Every card needs to be looked up, often multiple times. I know they can be learned, but convincing your playgroup it's worth those first two or three super clunky games seems like a pretty tall order in the era of immediate gratification.

I have absolutely no problem with the iconography at all. My current concerns are with the endgame scoring cards (Mayoral Favours) & set rounds with no player manipulated endgame. Cry me a river all you passive players, this game, like many, should be played aggressively. I'd prefer it (as per RftG) if players could accelerate the game & precipitate the endgame. At the moment, it feels like there's a luxury of time, generating a lack of tension & pressure. Nevertheless, solid systems beneath.

Interesting mechanics, while the weight of award cards is close to 50% of total score, which seems a bit exaggerated.

I enjoyed it. But the game has plentiful Icons & Symbols which litter every card, every tile and it can take a bit of time to know what your card does, what each tile does; but also weigh up whether the action is any good; it unfortuently ends up hurting long-term goals because you are repeatedly looking at the card index to know what your cards do.  I'm confident with enough re-plays you will get to know what the cards do.

Would play again

Too complicated for its own good.  The hand management portion of the game is really clunky and turns a simple worker placement game into a un-fun maze of tepid choices. 

There's no improved action economy which drives strategy.  It replicates the worst aspect of Ticket to Ride through random end-game condition cards that have zero cross-over with your goal.

Not a bad game. I would play it again but I would definitely lobby my group to play something else.

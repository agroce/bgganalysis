Just played the core set so far, with my partner and 13 year old daughter. Enjoyed every game so far. daughter beat me with the Dwarves ( I played Chaos), she was delighted!

This was 4 years ago. Now today it sits on a shelf unlooked at. Umm need to play again.

My first LCG... Why I'm drawn to the Warhammer universe (and the kids like it as well) is beyond me. It's probably that I'm a Fantasy Flight Games fan, if nothing else. This is an interesting game that -- for me -- takes some getting used to. What I'm seeing right off the bat is a high degree of variety (every game has been different -- even with the same races), combinations that make their presence felt in some games and not in others (thankfully or not, depending on what side you're on), and some difficult decisions regarding how to play cards. Eric Lang is really quite an intriguing game designer, that's for sure, and he's created quite a game here that's simple, relatively quick to play (unless you're like me and suffer from some serious AP when playing this), and has some brilliant artwork.

By far the best of the Fantasy Flight 'Living Card Game' series. Doesn't have the ghastly artwork of Call of Cthulhu, nor the grindy and lengthy nature of Game of Thrones.

Excellent 2 player duelling game for those who want a Warhammer fix in about 30 minutes.. Each faction does a great job of recreating the playing style of those armies in the Warhammer minitures game. 

Really sick of the deckbuilding aspect, so I'm getting rid of everything but the core set and Assault on Ulthuan.

I really don't like card games that are over in 4 or 5 turns. What's the point of having a 40 odd card deck if you're only going to see the first 15 cards or so. Just many more things I'd rather play.

The best LCG game from FFG in my opinion. Very streamlined mechanics and a much loved background theme makes this a game that I go back to again and again. And the artwork is magnificent
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Pretty good, but I have no interest in the LCG format and I find that Summoner Wars is comparable and more fun.  

I admit we purchased it mostly on the hype and the promise of having a rich 2-player card game.  What's good about it is that it requires thought but is neither a brain-burner nor a deterministic game.  Your choices are exactly that;  you're neither forced into a single best option nor are your options unlimited.

Another surprise is that my 10-yo recently taught his 5-yo how to play!   Granted, my youngest son is already an excellent reader and used to playing Battlestations and other games, but it was nonetheless surprising and amusing to see him dealin' the damage to his brother's capital.

The rating is from an avid Warhammer Fantasy fan.  When I'm playing the game, it feels like I'm actually playing in the Old World.  I love the art, the flavor, the three areas to fight in, and the 6 armies.  I will admit you really do want to pick up the Assault deluxe expansion, but nothing else is "required", but also, nothing is wasted if you do pick them up!  I play this with my wife and she really loves the humans and dwarves...she does kick me around a lot.

One of E Lang's better card game, I must say.

The strategy with multi-location providing different resources proves to be something interesting to juggle. 

The game is let down by the simplicity of the combat resolution rounds, which as a whole, is not a bad thing.

Like all card games of such nature, the draw affects the outcome. The rules set are also incomplete, leaving room for misinterpretations. Some house rules necessary. 

Above average card game. Did not like the drawn out LCG issues though.

Very enjoyable Living Card Game that can result is some epic battles. Each race is fun to play and some expansions add variety. Wish there were some way to slow down battles though as Quests do not get developed at all so the game is limited. May come up with a house rule about having to complete Quests to win.

RATING: 10
Quite possibly my favorite card game in the world. Warhammer Invasion is so brilliant, in that almost every card can do an entirely different thing for your strategy depending on which of three areas you play it in. Also, though my devotion to the LCG model is quite comprehensive, Warhammer Invasion gets the upper hand because its timing is governed by the holy entity known as the stack. Try as I might I cannot get over this game. More than any other LCG, I wish I knew another dedicated player that would spend as much time thinking about decks as I do.

The game feels dynamic and presents a choice of paths to victory - some of which can even create sudden reversals in the game state. Nice! B-) The play space tends to look chaotic and is difficult to "read" from across the table, though.

A game I really wanted to like but which went the opposite way for me. Was not a fan of how the gameplay turned out although I found the mechanics interesting as a whole. The artwork for some reason fell flat for me as well.

In the end I had to ask myself if this was a game I would play when I had other similar games around, and when the answer was a clear cut "NO" the decision to trade it off was an obvious one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I'm not sure I'm sold on the concept of LCGs, but I can say for certain that from a gameplay standpoint, W:I is excellent.  The level of strategy is sold, and the factions do all feel different.

I think I would rate it higher if a particularly good or bad draw didn't have such an impact on the game, but it can still be fun to put up a good fight.

[Updated April 2012]
So, what I discovered is that as soon as you modify the base game, I enjoy the game far less since you introduce deck-building into the equation.  Basically, the actual game of Warhammer: Invasion is solid, and I really like it.  It's the concept of LCGs that I don't like at all.  If this game was designed to be balanced and a 1-off box set, I would absolutely love it and probably knock it up another point or two.

Hard to rate, as I played 4 games with the same deck, built by my opponent.  Deck played well, game seemed fun, enjoyed it.  But about half the fun in a CCG or LCG is in deckbuilding, and having only seen 3 different decks leaves a lot of the game unexplored.  Rating a preliminary 7.

Just amazing. The rules could do with a bit of rewording here and there (that is why a 9 and not a 10), but hey, that is what the forums on the internet are for. The game is a living card game. New card expansions are out already and they are not random cards. You can see what you get by doing a search on the internet. The game its self is fun and tactical as well. Just great. Take a look at a few video reviews to see how it is played. Well worth getting.

Great game. I had to work hard to teach this to my wife, but now she is constantly asking me to play it. I like that you have more control over card draw and resources 'mana' than say Magic; however, the game is still lacking super crazy combos, unique cards and deckbuilding - hopefully this will come with the battle packs and time. 
I understand that you can't introduce a new system and an overflow of technical cards at the same time.

This is a great card game, one of the better Fantasy Flight LCGs alongside Android: Netrunner. Art is beautiful, mechanics great, especially how you lay out your cards around the bases.

RATING: 6
Fast and furious, you're in action the whole time; in some ways, seems like magic but with all the rules slowing things down taken out. It almost feels as if it would be better if it were to go more slowly, so you could better explore the possible strategies opened by all the cards. Lots of screw you plays, even outside of combat. Should have lots of replayability from the base game alone.

First impressions: first game was over very fast, second took a bit longer as we knew the cards better. Must try the drafting rules and the other races.

I approached this game cautiously, thinking it was WarCry redone. However, it is a quite different game, with many new twists.

I really like the look of this one, I will be looking to thin the herd on my CCG shelf and use the funds to get this, it looks fantastic.


Ok update, I have it, and have ingested the rules, over and over, and finally got a proper play test,with everything out in front of me on the table. Dwarves v. Orcs and the Dwarves won, but in a real game the way this one went, the Orcs prolly woulda taken it. the choices I made were viable and kinda sneaky, but a real player may have went for the teeth of the little folk early on and pulled it off, who knows?

I have some familiarity with the universe through electronic games and have NEVER EVER wanted to play the greenskins (do so like to crunch em tho) but in this game I think I will give them a whirl! Despite my best efforts to play correctly some snafus came up as I had only read the rules to this point, and even still I LIKE THIS GAME! It IS fun! the strategy is there and I look forward to those first plays against a real human, until then I will play some more solo just to get the hang of the flow, and go from there, fun stuff, highly recommended.

Ok another update, this is well after the fact, but I have several plays now, and love it! Each one we got clearer and clearer on the rules and this is a wicked fun little system! The combat is correctly dreadful, and exhiliratingly fun at the same time, the balance in the launch units seemed good, and I see no reason to doubt the direction as has been stated. this one will see near completion in the purchase realm, and will see play time, good stuff.

For trade as a bundle with many battle packs and both expansions.  Core set played with but treated kindly, Assault on Ulthuan (The expansion that introduces the Dark and High Elves capital boards) has been played with as well.  All other battle packs have been opened and looked at, but never played with. They are:March of the Damned (Expansion), Arcane Fire, Bleeding Sun, Path of the Zealot, Redemption of a Mage, The Deathmaster's Dance, The Fall of Karak Grimaz, The Skavenblight Threat, The Warpstone Chronicles, and Tooth and Claw.  I love this game, but just don't have the time to deck build as much as I'd like with all my game group's game collections and my own.

Very good LCG which is highly playable straight from the box. Gameplay is quick (once you learn the cards) and offers a great deal of strategic and tactical decisions. Even with the base set there are so many ways to combine the cards to get maximum effect. The way the game works with the different regions in your city you have to develop and the different benefits each region gives you, makes for some hard choices. Also choosing which cards to use for the much needed developments can be quite agonizing. I'm looking forward to getting more cards and playing the draft variant. I believe this is when the game will really shine.

This game suffered from the fact that I hardly ever get to play two player games. I really liked it. But I could not justify it gathering dust on my shelves for even longer. Traded it away, with pain in my heart.

Only played twice now but loving the game so far. Like how simple the mechanics are and how thematic each faction is. The orcs play like orcs (go get 'em!) and the dwarves play like dwarves (build up foundation and then go!), etc. The rules are simple to understand and there's lots of strategic decisions to be made throughout. The card art and components are fantastic and the game plays in under an hour, sometimes just over 30 minutes. Looking forward to many more plays of this including getting and playing some expansions. Love the LCG's. Really great bang-for-your-buck.

RATING: 5
Rather similar to MtG, but with the fixed 'living card game' format. Some differences, most obvious is the capital board and 3 areas to put your creatures and the effects of them in those areas.

But combat is rather dull - just mass up and smash, currently a lot less going on than in magic, with no real opportunity for clever tricks etc. Of course with an extended card pool this could change.

Played it solid for an evening and it was 'ok' but while playing I just felt I'd rather be playing magic. Theme doesn't help - going for WH40K might have been better, at least it would then be very different from magic ...

Overall, didn't wow me in the way the CoC LCG did, no interest in investing in this one.

Quick and straight-forward gameplay here.
Easy to grasp rules with a short playtime of 15-30 min.

The graphic of the cards are superb, but recyceled from GW`s Warhammer Stuff.

The factions have well implemented atmospheric Old World touch: Orcz are all about offense, Empire is defensive but flexible, Chaos unpredictiable by his corruption, Dwarves focus on Defense.

Played the store demo copy several times, until I decided to buy for myself. A neat little collectible-like card game, which takes the "all cards can be land" mechanic one better with "all cards can be card draw". I'm iffy on the theme, being more of a SF person, but the mechanics were nice enough to draw me in anyway. I do also like the LCG concept, although I would have liked to be able to play elves without waiting for months.

This also comes with a special drafting version, including 20 extra cards in an attempt to make a 2-player draft interesting. It's not Dominion or anything, but I plan on giving the drafting system a try when I get a chance.

RATING: 7
Conocido de la mano de Marc. Está bastante bien. Es un juego de cartas. Cada jugador controla una capital con tres zonas: El reino (que genera recursos_), el campo de batalla (que alberga tu capacidad de ataque) y el quest, que te permite hacer acciones épicas y obtener nuevas  cartas. Es un juego de coste de oportunidad. Una carta solo la puedes jugar en una de las zonas... y salvo excepciones, normalmente no puedes moverlas de una zona a otra. Los combates se resuelven por mera comparación. Gana quien consigue destruir dos zonas de la capital enemiga. Sencillo y rápido de jugar. Un buen descubrimiento.

Finalmente acabé comprandome mi copia en español, para continuar nuestra particular liga (Marc y yo) pudiendo ir a los encuentros con los mazos ya preparados.

Cambiado por Pinguinos & cia +  Hive+Mosquito + Atlanteon en la bsk en oct 2010 a waltien (benidorm-alicante). Me dió pena deshacerme de él, pero lo más probable es que solo lo juegue con Marc y él ya lo tiene. Además, lo de preparar mazos no me atrae demasiado (aunque este juego está realmente muy bien).

RATING: 7
An interesting game, it seems a player who manages to be the first to build a reasonable engine (drawing cards and resources) will steamroll the other player.  There is take that and counter take that in the game, but it feels frustrating at times - more a case of building a plan to see it undone by a lucky card rather than by a clever defense.  More plays will solidify whether there is more strategy and play here.  I think it will be best played with deck building - one box is enough still - as a bunch of poor cards can hamstring a deck.

There seems some interesting potential strategies to follow here, depleting decks, out producing, etc etc.  Each faction has a different flavour and plays differently too - familiarity with that will be key (and will only come after several plays).

So after all that, this game is a bit of an unknown for me.  After several plays this could still swing to an 8, or it could be dropped to a 7... hopefully more plays will alleviate my concerns, we shall see!

Update: Played some more.  Can still be a whitewash, but as a short game it's quite good.  I am happy with the 7.5 rating as current, once I get into deck building I may raise it, I don't know.  A good solid game with some good choices to be made throughout - best played when you set the deck up and play several games in a row.

Update: played a draft game.  Took far too long to draft (it was late), so we just played a normal game.  I like the idea of the way the draft itself can be a part of the game.  But it seems to take a long time to draft for a short game length.  Even if you plan to play several games in a row with the same deck.

Still regard it as quite a good game.  Can be a whitewash at times, but enjoyable all the same.

Update:  Played 11 times. Don't think I'll bother getting it out again unless someone asks for it.  I don't understand the good recommendations people are giving this game, seems to be a whitewash from one or the other side most games.  Feels like the same level of decision making and thought that goes into smaller card games like Condottiere and Fairy Tale, but with more rules, more exceptions, more bits, more set up, longer play time, - overall seems to want to be a small and fun card game but is poderously long and overweight for the little it achieves.

What a wonderfully designed card game.  Certainly a well streamlined game that played very well as a 2 player game.  Simple design, yet lots of variability in cards and options.

Rated 9 as this is the best card game I think I've played to date (and I've played quite a lot).  Simplicity in rules earns big points in my ratings!

Gosh! I wouldn't believe if someone told me a month ago I would play wargame. I'm a girl after all. 

This game stroke root in our house and became a minion for many evenings. It's full of war ruse, traps, counterstrikes and extreme confrontation. 

What I don't like:

- there're some cards that can destroy everything (your supports, units and developments). If it happens your Warhammer race's destiny becomes miserable. From that time and till the end of the game you have nothing else to do but observe you're loosing each and every of your turn. 

- there're cards intended for four players and there aren't good rules for four players.

- some elements are undeveloped. Example is quest. The game seems to be intense and quite quick, but quest requires at least 4 turns to play. 

- it also gives the strong impression that Destruction is stronger and game is unbalanced.

[u]September 2010:[/u] Played only with the base set and without any deck building whatsoever.
The game is good and fun at the moment but nowhere close as exciting as Magic. The decks in the base game aren't that diversified and don't really feel that different but that's not a big minus considering that I guess the real game reside in the deck-building. Right now, we are still a bit discovering the game before getting into that (also waiting to see how lasting it is before buying expansions). After 5 plays.

I like the concept of the TCG's, whereby you know exactly what cards you are purchasing.  This aids tremendously in the deck building.

However, this game does suffer from a typical "Build your own deck" card game atmosphere - you opponent has bought three copies of the base game and the expansions, and you have only one copy due to cost contraints, and so therefore only have 1 copy of some of the really, really good cards.  Definitely something to play between friends who all agree to spend the same amount of money.

However, it is a fun game, and probably one of the better ones out there.  I love the theme (although WH40K would have been better), and the concept of attacking the "capital" building is an excellent idea.

I think I could play this on a regular basis with the right people.

Into the "For Trade" bin - I just don't see this getting played very often because it behaves just like a CCG in terms of what everyone else has - the only difference is the lack of "randomness" in the card packs.  But if everyone else is spending just as much on this game as they are on Magic, and getting three copies of all of the good cards, what is the point?

I love to play it and wish my wife would love it too. Unfortunately she doesn't like it and I have to play with my collages and it isn't too often.

I have 2 copies of everything they released before going to the 3x of each card per set. I would prefer to send it as a lump set, since I don't have them separated per expansion, but for the right situation anything is possible.

What I own includes:

Base set: 2x copies
Assault on Ulthuan (elf expansion): 2x copies
Arcane Fire: 2x copies
Path of the Zealot: 2x copies
The Deathmaster's Dance: 2x copies
The Skavenblight Threat: 2x copies
The Warpstone Chronicles: 2x copies
Tooth and Claw: 2x copies

The Burning of Derricksburg: 1x copy
The Fall of Karak Grimaz: 1x copy
The Silent Forge: 1x copy

I would also obviously send the box I have them in, and I have some terribly awful proxies of cards that we used in our non-tournament, friendly game decks. I like the LCG idea, but going back to school means I have less free time to tinker with something like this right now.

My favorite of Lang's LCGs and a solid attack/defend game. I never felt like developments were terribly exciting, and this was maybe one too many games for the "Limited" keyword, but those are minor complaints. 

I think it hits all the sweet-spots for a semi-casual game: deckbuilding is open but not too open; in-game decisions are important, but not AP-inducing (usually); tempo varies, but not too wildly; decking is in play some of the time. 

It's a shame it never really caught on in the US.

A fun take on the two player battle card game.  

Having three regions that you need to pay attention to at all times makes for some really frustrating decisions.  The different races are all unique, and play quite differently.  This leads to quite a bit of replay-ability.

I love the Warhammer world, so I'm more apt to like a game that is based upon that realm.  But this game is more than just fluff for a Warhammer fan: it is a fantastic deck construction game.

With all the expansions, there are plenty of cards to keep busy modifying decks and trying out new combinations.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very good game of cards combination. It's violent but also ask for building and planning. The four races play very differently and each has its own distinctive feeling
Interesting  as a fantasy universe even if you are not a fan of the license

The core set offers good value for money it works very well as a standalone product even if you are not interested in the expansions.

I stayed away from TCGs like Magic for a long time. Not because of the mechanics. I was just afraid, that I would like them and therefore spent a lot of money on them. After all, I'm a completionist. Then I played the excellent PSP-homebrew software Wagic which let's you play Magic without the need to buy any card. What can I say, I was hooked and when a friend introduced me to Warhammer Invasion, I knew that I wanted to go down that road. Here is why:

* Deckbuilding: I do really like the idea of building your own deck of cards. As a big fan of Race for the Galaxy, I also enjoy predefined decks. But for me, it is even more satisfying to built my own deck and surprise my friends with all the cool combos I discovered or be surprised by their findings.

* A plethora of options: Since your captiol is divided into three parts and each part has a different function, it's not so easy to decide where to play a certain card. Do i go for more resources or is it time for a big attack?

* Great replayability: Because of the deck building aspect and the many ways to use a card, you get a lot of value for your investment.

* Let's play again: What I really do like is that most of my friends want to play Warhammer Invasion again and again. There are not too many other games where my friends ask for a revenge immediately after putting down the last card.

* Combos: I'm a sucker for games in which you can discover combos and this is the whole purpose of this game.

After all this praise, here are the not so good things:

* Living card game: It is a game that get's expanded each month. While this is great for the game itself, it is not that good for my wallet. Since I'm a completionist, I spend money on this one every month. In fact, I guess I spent more money on this one than any other game I own. Decide for yourself if you want to go down this road.

* Rules: Don't get me wrong, the rule book does a good job explaining the game. But: Because of all the crazy combos enabled by the cards, you'll most likely run into situations which are not covered in the rules. Thankfully, me and my friends agreed to use common sense in these situations. But I could see this become a problem while playing with a rules lawyer.

A solid two player dueling game, would be higher, but it just tends to be too long and too fiddly for what it is. That being said, it has some very interesting mechanics and the artwork is just stunning. The expansions help it out a lot

RATING: 6
Bought the base game + two large expansions. Nice to see some card games around that are obviously steering clear of the design and marketing failures of Magic. 

I wish they had made this 40K though. The WH fantasy universe isn't quite as interesting to me as the sci fi game.

Sold for lack of plays, and the overwhelmingness of catching up on years worth of expansions.

Ok game, only tried the prebuilt decks and while ok it wasn't terrible exciting. I must give them credit for the super simple to grasp game play compared to many other CCG/LCG. You're up and running in no time which is a great plus.

Warhammer: Invasion is fun. As a former CCG/CMG player, I enjoyed my plays of it and would quickly and easily play it again if asked. My problem with it is simply a matter of opportunity. In order to really and enjoy it would require more time than I have and the presence of a regular two player opponent that I currently lack. As it stands, I am perfectly willing to play it on occasion but I do not foresee it becoming a regular occurrence. Too bad.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Added Comments:  After 30 plays, and the addition of about a dozen expansion decks, Invasion continues to reward different tactics and strategies, deck experimentation, and even completely random deck play.  My only wish is that when card sets like Legends and cycles are combined, that there were someway to expand the duration of the game.  Maybe 10-pts until burning?  Still, this is my favorite of the LCG games, and only gets better with repeated plays.

Not perfect, but absolutely a go-to game for straight-forward game play and excellent card mechanics.  The expansion decks add great depth, and the presentation and artwork is perfect across the board.  Seriously, I love this game.

M:TG is the innevitable comparison point.   There are two main innovations in Invasion - (1) the three zone capital boards, and (2) the power icons that have different effects depending on what zone you allocate your cards to.  Combat is en-masse, making it less strategic than in Magic.  That's the biggest weakness in the design.  The core set gives enough to get you going, but I fear it will feel quite "samey" too quickley, lacking the diversity of tactics that you see in Magic.  It's really hard not to compare it to that. The neutral cards in the core set are quite dull and dilute the starter decks too much, but that can be easily fixed.  The monthly expansions could add a lot of richness to this game - but the investment to stay current with this game is just as bad as any CCG, so I've stayed away.   The starter box was just too flat to justify going forward with the game.

Give me a feeling from CCGs and don't force me to buy new cards all over again.
The Core Set can be easily treated as stand alone card game for 2 players (with 4 different decks) and I like it much. 
It is also worth to mention, that decks in Core Set are (probalby) good balanced. 
In the other hand rule book really need a big FAQ.

Got Warhammer Invasion from work in a gift exchange. Looking forward in trying out the game for the first time.

Played a couple of times and can't get enough of it. Going to get the expansions.

*update*

Warhammer Invasion is my favorite 2 player game by a long shot. Expansions are well worth it for more flexablility in deck building.

Lost count the amount of hours I spent reading the cards when I was building my decks, looking for possible combos with different cards. Reminds me my day with Magic: The Gathering.

Bought the basic set with the expansions again. Keeping the Order cards and giving the destruction cards to the player I play with on a regular basis. That way, cards which has only one each, now we have two of each. 

I prefer the order and my friend the destruction. So it works well.

*Update*
Got the basic game again for the 3rd time. This time in a math trade.

It was okay, but never really catches my attention. The attack/defense mechanics make sense, but are so dependent on decent regular draws...a few too many enhancement draws and no troops and your soon overwhelmed. No real strategy sat the deck building.

RATING: 9
Warhammer Invasion is one of the finest card games I've ever played.  The fast-paced gameplay is never dull, and careful resource management balances well with the constant combat rush.  Considering the over-the-top coolness of the Warhammer universe, attractive game components, and a very reasonable entry price, I can't help but give Warhammer: Invasion the highest marks.

The only inherent flaw with the game is that the factions aren't balanced right out of the box.  The rating I've given assumes you're going to expand the game...without any expansions, it's more like an 8.

Got this for Christmas and have not had a chance to play it enough to form a strong opinion of it, but so far it seems like a really solid game that should improve with the addition of some of the expansions. Edit: I have since bought the Assault on Ulthuan expansion, and it really completes this game. Edit: After a few tries, we decided it wasn't for us and traded it. It is a good game! But I have too many other games I like better.

By far the most challenging game I've ever played (apart from chess :D). If you mix the cards included in the Core Set with the cards of all expansions and battlepacks, the number of strategies and combinations is infinite. And oh... by saying "infinite" I mean "INFINITE". Simply, it will be impossible to make an OP insta-win deck. You need to carefully plan what cards to include in your deck in anticipation of the cards your opponent is going to use.

RATING: 7
I like the mechanics better than Magic: The Gathering. With three different areas to play cards for different benefits, developments to use up marginal cards, massed combat, univeral trample, no summoning sickness, persistent unit health, and far fewer special rules on cards, this is a much more refined game that seldom stagnates and involves plenty of strategy during (not just before) play. The downsides are that it is 2-player and there aren't as many cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Not a bad game at all, but not appropriate with the boys I would do most of my games with. I got it on a sort of whim, hoping it would be a fun two player game for my wife and I...

Again, great game, just doesn't fit.

I wanted a replacement for Magic: the Gathering. It is a good alternative but not better. I feel the variance is even more pronounced in this game even though we get to set the # of resources we get each turn and the number of cards we draw (which is a big plus for the game).

Ambivalens érzéseim vannak a játékkal kapcsolatban. Félek hogy csak azért, mert már annyi pénzt beleöltünk, hogy nem tudom még a saját magamanak se bevallani, hogy nem egy jó játék.
Igazából több komoly bajom van vele: 

1. Ez az lcg dolog egy jó nagy beeteés. Senki ne higgye azt, hogy az alapdoboz olyan, mint egy társasjáték. Az csak egy nagyon drága kedvcsináló, mivel önmagában három játék után megunható. A kiegészítők vásárlása pedig nem a magyar pénztárcához van igazítva.

2. A játék epic battle-öket ígér. Ami az elején még igaz is volt. Minden kiegészítővel überelni akarták az előzőket és olyan tápos lapok lettek, hogy egy party nem tart tovább 5-10 körnél. Ez pedig nagyon nem jó, mert így a szerencse szerepe is hatványozottan megnő, valammint nincs meg a birodalom építgetés élvezete. Ki kell talalni házi korlátozásokat, mert versenyszerű játék értelmetlen.

After two plays I don't see the appeal. It looks great for sure and there are a few interesting ideas but the game itself lacks excitement. Surprising moves are rare, available options are severely limited, and the entire experience is rather flat.

I'd much rather play a round of M:TG (with preconstructed decks if that's what draws you to Invasion) which allows for more strategic play and much greater variety.

Interesting card game - I prefer this to Magic.  It has great theme ( I love the WH universe) and interesting card play.  First read of the rules makes it seem a bit too simple and shallow, but playing proves this otherwise.  Lots of interesting interactions between the cards and hard decisions to make every round.  I'm a bit concerned about the LCG model introducing too many cards too quickly, but I'm not interested in competitive play anyways.

Amazing theme, good artwork and near-perfect gameplay mechanics make this the grand champions of Fantasy Flight's LCG line, hands down.

The mechanics are very similar to many CCG's from the past but manages to add a couple of unique twists to the mix. The concept of having a big city to defend and expand in different areas to achieve different goals is great, as is the way every support and unit card can use its power help with card drawing, resource-gathering and combat depending on the situation. It's fairly easy to learn and comes packed with four different factions to play right from the get go, and with all the expansions and battle packs that are available for it you pretty much have endless amounts of decks and strategies to try out. It's about as much fun as you could possibly have with a card game, and without the hassle of random boosters packs.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A nice quick slugfest with a lot of the baggage and crap from other CCGs I've played stripped out.  It really is all about the game with lots of actual in game choices introduced with the zone choice.  Plenty of fighting and games tend not to linger.

Definitely recommended, read my review in the W:I folder if you want to know more.  Only reason it isn't rated higher (and I traded it away) is because I can't do the CCG or LCG treadmill, nor do I have the time to do constructed decks.

- It's not MtG.
- Not portable like MtG (cannot easily take 2 decks to a café).
- I find the card layout to be a huge step backwards compared with MtG. Cards costs and effects are not obvious at a glance.

i liked it, unfortunatelly in my buddy group there are not enough interest in this game, we prefer in general hex and counters

I haven’t had much experience with collectible card games, so I have hard time comparing it to those and I haven’t had experience with deck building aside from Dominion and Thunderstone. Anyway, this is a decent game I could tell from my experience. It’s not too complicated and there where some tough decisions especially where to place the units. I think this will be even more interesting with deck building.

Pretty much exactly what I wanted -- "CCG 2.0" with good art, distinct factions, fast-flowing play, and simple rules with very little of the grit that comes along with traditional CCGs with their emphasis on massive card libraries and deck-building. Of course you lose depth and replayability versus a conventional CCG, but if like me you won't be playing more than a dozen times a year, then this is the shake-out-of-the-box-and-have-at-it CCG that you've been waiting for.

If you know and like  Magic the Gathering then you probably like this one too. Event though different in many details when you play it feels the same (= you build up a mana/ressource engine to buy Fighter/Monsters/Spells to battle against your opponents army). This starter kit includes more advanced cards (=abilities) than for instance Magic tG in their starter kits. I play with the German edition; not all translations are top, some grammar errors and misspells can be found. This doesn't allow to get the game an 8 rating as rarely you just don't understand what card action/ability was meant for.

Nice cards and general idea. 

I feel, in any case, that you need to know well your advantages and disadvantages. I also feel that the races that have many attacks (Chaos and Orks) are advantaged. 
But this may be unjust since I played only once. 

For now I'd play the game, but I'm not overly enthusiastic about it.

A fun card game that really opens up the Warhammer Fantasy world to the common gamer.  While the game is itself balanced, there are lots of moments where certain cards and combos just don't make sense.  Still, as mechanics go it is a good way to rate things.

Traded with both expansions for Lee vs. Grant and Autumn of Glory

This game is good fun, plays quickly and can be tense and a really good fight, however many times it can be a complete whitewash, where one player destroys the other due to a good starting hand or a particularly lucky drawing of a card.

Very tactical and relatively simple game.  Has some good ideas but I find it a but frustrating...not enough units and too many tactics cards.

A great card game that I play quite frequently in a semi-formal play group here in Calgary (message for details if you want in.) Simple mechanics allow for easy learning, there is also a satisfying feeling of mastery after you gain experience with the game. The LCG format means you don't have to burn through thousands of dollars on cards to be competitive, like in Magic.

I like how this game makes you decide where to spend resources. The 3 field system isn't an entirely new concept, but it's a little different here and works very well. I like how fast games go and how brutal the combat is. I do think that at least the initial set has some serious balance problems though. From a tournament standpoint it's not a big deal, but for pick-up-and-play it's fairly annoying. If they can continue to build more interesting and balanced abilities onto this system it could be truly great, because the core mechanics are really tight.

An Eric Lang card game. That should say most of what needs to be said. However, for those who aren't familiar with his work, this game has some very innovative mechanics, seems to be well balanced, and possesses rules that are deceptively simple. It's one of those games that you can easily discover new strategies for every time you play. Also, the Warhammer world is well incorporated into the game and cards.

A heavy-weight. My favorite LCG. The theme is depicted in a VERY consistent way. The gameplay mechanics are top notch. The designer took everything that makes Magic what it is (or other CCGs) and used it just like a poet could use the alphabet.

RATING: 5
Really, really wanted to like this more than I do.  The Warhammer world is fun, the art is fantastic, and the component quality* and presentation are like a gingerbread house in the middle of the woods.

In the end the problem, to quote my son, is that "it's not [i]Magic[/i]."

Not that it has to be, or even that it's trying to be.  But I get where he's coming from:  why play this when you could be playing [boardgame=463][i]Magic: The Gathering[/i][/boardgame]?  It's a better game, a deeper game, a more satisfying game.  And if we're going to be playing a fantasy-themed card game for the next 20 minutes, I'd rather throw some [i]Magic[/i] around.

Included, from [i]The Corruption Cycle[/i]:

[gameid=55916]
[gameid=57940]
[gameid=58157]
[gameid=61739]
[gameid=65217]

Also:

[gameid=63787]

(Donated to college games library.)

[size=7]*With the exception of different-sized cards in the expansions.  I hate card sleeves, and when the cards are even fractionally larger or smaller or funny-shaped it affects the shuffle.  (And, no, pile sorting doesn't randomize the cards—it just makes sure no two cards are next to each other.)  If you overhand or monge shuffle with different sized cards, they end up clumped by size.  Riffle shuffling is better, but the bigger cards get mangulated faster.  Ah, well.  I should count myself lucky to have such problems, no?[/size]

A few first games were really fun and I expect the rating to go up with more plays and expansions added.  I like the fact that the factions have distinct play-style and appreciate the decisions during gameplay.  

The only thing that bothers me about the core set is the rarity of some cards.  The best ones are singles and you need 3 copies for competitive play.  The same applies to the Corruption cycle and Assault on Ulthuan expansion.  Fortunately, later expansions adopted proper 3-copies for each card distribution method.  

Grapihcs are JUST AWSOME.  The cards would be worth buying for illustrations only. 

Gameplay is much more engaging compared to MtG and there are more decisions to make, which adds up for a better experience.

The game gets better with each expansion.  After over 600 games, I can objectively say that it is the best card game that I have ever played.  

I cannot wait to compare Warhammer to Android: Netrunner.  Have high hopes for A:N.

Update: netrunner completely kills Warhammer.  It is better in every respect.  More intense, more varied, more intersting.  

Rating lowered to 6 after the Gathering the winds combo appeared.  The most stupid move ever from the design team to allow for such non-interaction.  Once I saw the combo in action, i knew it was time to move on and sell my entire collection.  fortunetly, netrunner was just around the corner.

The game is good but sometimes it doesn't have a strong relation betwen mechanics and theme. I don't know, the name of the cards and the effect didn't seem to make much sense.

About as good as I figured, which is a 7 for me, as I knew quite a bit about it before actually playing.  Rules are pretty straight forward but for some reason I found them just a touch tricky, and even in play (geez maybe I am getting old…sigh)  

Pretty much a twist on Magic as others have noted, get your resources, draw cards, play cards by paying for them and attack if you can.  I like it for sure, pacing seems a tad slow (would be bad with more than 2 for sure) as you need to look at just about every card in play but I do like the decisions you have to make.   

Update – 7 => 7.5 Played a few more times, game has decent decision making for its length and is enjoyable.

I'm happy to own this beautifully produced battle deck 2-player, though I don't get to play it much and I'm not a Magic fan. I do often feel I'm not getting my deck to work for me, plodding out when my opponent is flying - I probably just need practice...

RATING: 8
You may not believe me, but with one learning game under my belt, this was a blast. 

There is a ton of potential areas for strategy in deck building (all dependent upon the card releases), it is not blind buy and I won't be chasing ultra-rares....and, most importantly, I had a damn good time and fun.

There are a ton of possibilities once the card flow gets going. You can adjust your card draws, your resources, your attack strength all in where you play your cards.

So far, I've enjoyed my intro games to both this and "A Game of Thrones". Honestly, both were a lot of fun. I'm really glad I gave these a go.

I have to admit that I've already converted some Magic players who immediately experienced a bit of pissiness at chasing rares and paying $30-$275 per card. They were pretty excited for the non-blind buy and fixed releases...all of the card play, 1/3rd the cost (by the year's end, the cost of a booster box, but a box where you got every card you needed in 3's). As they put it, they can handle $30 bucks a month if they decide to buy 3 of each booster--after all, that's the cost of one card sometimes.

Me? I only care that I have fun, see possibilities, and see potential in the game and the time spent with players.

We may be starting a league in town. I may be starting two: Throne Thursday (to agument my Throw Down Thursday) and Invasionanza.

Truly, I had a lot of fun...now for Chaos in the Old World and the Call of Cthulu LCG...if it keeps being fun, I'm in.

I couldn't resist.  I played one game and liked the mechanics.  I do not like the distribution of cards, however.  Troll Vomit, for example, is a devastating card...that FFG provides one of in each core set.  They needed to provide three copies of each card, and charge more.  I don't appreciate being forced to purchase multiple core sets to get a complete and competitive collection.

W:I does feel a bit like my favorite CCG, Legend of the Five Rings.  I've seen some complaints that coming back from an early disadvantage is tough.  I'm going to disagree.  Resources put into an early attack don't help you generate cash or get more cards.  Further, as your capital takes damage, you suffer no loss of productivity.  What this means is that unlike in L5R, where losing a province or two early is devastating, in W:I, taking early damage to your capital isn't the end of the world.  I'm looking forward to more plays.

WAY better than the other LCG I played, Call of Cthulhu. The nature of attack and defense in this one and the fact that you need to attack in multiple "regions" for the most part protects against the "you-can't-beat-my-excellent-draw-I-just-made-so-you-lose" quality of some of these games. Ultimately it isn't THAT different from the many other card combat games out there, but this is one of the better ones.

this game is excellently designed and a lot of fun to play - looking forward to seeing where they take it.

The Kingdom boards put control of resources and card drawing with the player and there is no "mana screw". Attacking and defending on three fronts also adds a new dimension of strategy.

**Update** Drop from 8 to 6. The game just isnt complex enough and seems quite boring to play - i'd much rather play Netrunner or Magic with 2 players.

Simple mechanics, solid game. Not sure how to rate the game. The game felt a bit restrictive in terms of what to do, despite the fact that players control how many cards they draw and how many resources they get. On the other hand, I'm really happy that each race has a unique identity and a different way of playing it (unlike say AGOT:LCG, where every house had similar cards with different names).

I think that the expansions will really be what makes or breaks the game for me. I look forward to really building up the decks and seeing how each race interacts with each other.

Having not played Magic since Jr. High School (to date myself, the Ice Age cards were just rolling out) this game scratches my CCG itch quite well.  There are some minor imbalances that I think are more my own fault for not knowing all the cards and counters (still, screw you Keystone Forge), but it's still a great game.  Wish it were more than just 2 players.

This was the first modern board game I have played and I can say one thing: this game has one of the most stupid rules I have ever encountered in a game and it is a rule thanks to which I was able to win.... the rule states that you choose the units with which you will defend your country but you don't have to choose any... they can watch as your enemy is attacking and destroying you and they won't even move. Plain stupid which led my friend to selling the game (thank you Bro). Never had it and never will have.

RATING: 5
WH:Invasion is beautifully published, the graphics are awesome. However I didn't like the game. The Core Set is said to be a playable game and there's no need to buy expansions. This is theoretically true, but core set in fact seems to me like a demo version, not the full game. It contains four races and to get the remaining two (High and Dark Elves) you have to buy the expansion (you get some elvish cards in the core set). Armies in the core set are unbalanced. If you play against someone who has some expansions forget about winning - you have to buy expansions to get the stronger cards. So if you buy it be prepared to spend a great deal of money on expansions. 

How is the game itself? To me it was annoying. At the beginning there's very few resources so players usually play 1-2 cards and end their turn. Then at some point production of resources increases and the game ends in couple of turns. Really boring, at least with the core set. Perhaps expansions fix that.

Not bad, although the core set decks seem to have too few characters in them. If you don't draw enough characters, you don't stand a chance.

I could see this being a lot better if you get seriously into deckbuilding, but I'm already doing that for Call of Cthulhu, and I don't want to waste even more of my limited free time.

Tracked down almost all expansions and battle packs, except for The Skavenblight Threat. I'm the only one in our group with this game (and collection), so I'll be the deck master, so everyone will always have a decent deck to play.
Played quite a few times already, recently received the Deluxe expansions. 2x base game + deluxe expansions allows for at least 7 well balanced decks (probably more). Plays exceptionally well and is positively received by everyone I've played with.

Like Call of Cthulhu, I suspect this was a better ccg than it is as a stand alone.  Still, it does a decent job (better than Cthulhu).  I wish the expansions were actual playable armies instead of various cards meant to be used to tweak existing decks.  If I wanted to tweak decks and care about competitiveness and balance, I'd play a CCG.  The base box is a good and somewhat balanced experience, but I can see it getting old rather quickly.

RATING: 5
There are interesting ideas, still I don't think I would be interested in long term play and deck building.

The fact that you can either invest to get more resources or more cards is very interesting. The problem is that I would have liked cards spent in these areas to be hidden so that you place them and forget about them. Now all these cards has special abilities that you must consider which makes the game more complex and chaotic.

Second, I don't like the token management. For card games, I prefer having almost the cards as components, no tokens.

Third, the fact that you have 3 areas that can be attacked makes you wide open it is very hard to defend. You cannot expect to place creature in every area before being able to get attacked. So you are likely to lose a region before getting a defendable kingdom. So personally, attack and defense would had only be done between the battle fields.

Fourth, I just find it stupid that successfully burning a enemy region does not destabilize in any way the enemy. So it does not really matter where to attack, just pickup 2 areas.

Fifth, it is interesting to be able to get rid of cards has development cards, it's just that it flood the board and get confusing sinc eyou can place them everywhere. Personally, As I suggested above, I would have played face down cards for Resource and cards only, and all other cards on the battle field face up.

RATING: 8
Compared to Magic or even Netrunner, this game gives a strong feeling of identification with the faction that we are playing: there is a strong consistency between the different cards of a faction. For the first time in a card game I feel like I am "living" during the game in the culture of a specific faction. 

The game itself is more "serious" than Magic: one has to manage resources (resources and card draws), and also study which zone to attack and which to defend. The feeling is less crazy than in Magic, where surprises abound, and where the deck consistency (at least for Duel Decks or draft) is much more thematically tenuous. 

Now, it runs longer than Magic, and even longer than Race, which is less than optimal. 

The game mechanics are also quite classic, compared to a game like Netrunner. 

I have not done any deck building yet, and I know that I will appreciate that—something I don't do with Magic, which is too open to do this as casually as with a Living Card Game. 

I can't help thinking that Netrunner is a richer game, with more emotions (thanks so the hidden cards, thanks to the bluffing and guessing), and more original mechanisms. However, after not playing Invasion for maybe ten days I am missing the strong thematic consistency of its decks; this is really what makes the game special for me.

Comments entered on 06 Jul 2011:

Warhammer: Invasion is the third Living Card Game released by Fantasy Flight Games. The Living Card Game system is a fixed distribution system. Warhammer: Invasion is a competitive game between two players using factions from the Warhammer universe. Each player attempts to destroy the capital of the opposing player.

I find the Living Card Game system to be very appealing because all of the cards can acquired to make a complete playset much more easily than a collectible card game or trading card game. I enjoy Warhammer: Invasion in particular because of the theme and the mechanics. There is an emphasis on managing resources and card draw mixed with creating a battlefield force that can defeat the opponent.

Like all customizable card systems, the decks can be constructed before play, but there is also a special set of cards specifically for conducting a two-player draft. A majority of my first 50-60 games were done with the drafting rules. In the summer of 2011 I used the Legends expansion to create 12 decks featuring the 12 available Legends. I also created 2 neutral decks featuring Skaven and Lizardmen. I intend to modify these decks as future Battle Packs are released. I am playing these decks against each other and attempting to complete as many possible matchups between them.

WOW! This is the first LCG/CCG in quite some time that was so simple yet still has layers of interaction. It's simply the best one I've played since CoC, and interestingly enough from the same designer.

More big praises:

- Beautiful Artwork, and I mean STUNNING
- Quality multi-player
- Cards are used as resources and still function normally rather than sacrifice or choose what they are used for; something new in this genre.

I can only see this one getting better. 

Update:

Many Battle Packs, 2 large box expansions and plenty of deck building later and I still love this game as much as ever. Great fun, great design, and especially in the last large expansion, great new ideas and strategies to try out.

Invasion is a blast.  The unique factions play dynamically out of the box, and deliver the Warhammer theme in spades.  Mechanically, this is probably the strongest of FFG's LCG series; the three zones provide simultaneously difficult economic and combat choices, again allowing the theme to permeate the gameplay better than several games of its ilk.  Deck construction can vary vastly even within a single faction, although this is a skill that needs to be learned again differently for this game.

It seems like a game I would like, but for some reason I don't like it as much as I'd think. The theme doesn't really do it for me (I never got into Warhammer in any form, so for me it's kind of like just another generic fantasy theme, only it's one that I actually don't care about). Mechanics are solid and the game definitely provides some fun, but as I already said - not as much as I'd like. I'm still playing it from time to time and having fun, and who knows - maybe I'll get deeper into it at some point.

Ken:
Magic:TG-esque card game with more player decisions.  Very well integrated theme that comes clearly through the asymmetric (yet well-balanced) sides.  Satisfying (to some degree) core box, although additional sets promise to provide interesting new mechanics, which will be needed after significant playtime.  Great artwork and design, with clear, succinct card text that still manages to fit in some flavor.

Kathleen:
I think this is a 7, although I jump to play Orks any chance I get.  I think the gameplay fits the theme, and I very much enjoy card games of this sort.

Warhammer: Invasion The Card Game is a two-player card game of intense warfare, clever kingdom management, and epic questing. Players must carefully allocate their resources as they seek to build their kingdom, complete quests, and attack the enemy’s capital. Games play out in 25-45 exciting minutes.
Will you play the indestructible grudge-bearing Dwarfs, the shrewd and manoeuvrable Empire, the savage and destructive Orcs, or the entropic and mutating forces of Chaos? Or will you cleverly craft an alliance, playing the combined might of the forces of either Order or Destruction?

RATING: 10
The move away from random distribution to their LCG format was a bold move that I heartily approved – no traditional CCG, no matter how attractive the theme and how good the mechanics, is a possible investment for me. Judging from how aggressively they have pursued this format since they introduced it as a trial balloon with the first Asylum packs for Call of Cthulhu, lots of other folks appreciated this move, too.

To me, Invasion represents a similarly bold move regarding the mechanics of these games, although this is possibly just due to my limited experience (Jyhad, Magic, the excellent ICE Lord of the Rings, WoW, Cthulhu, Game of Thrones, ... well, maybe not that limited after all). Anyway, this is the only game of this format where you do not directly decide on your offense/defense, but also on your resource and card drawing engine. Depending on the capital zone you place a unit into, it can increase your spending power, let you draw more cards or go out and hurt your opponent.

Coupling these effects to the function of the capitol zones as victory points – destroy two of them in the opposing capital, and you’ve won – makes for very interesting decisions, even when disregarding special abilities of units or other cards. A lot of CCGs failed for me because the basic strategy was trivial unless spiced up by cards that superceded the basic rules. Interestingly, the first game that broke it’s own rules did not make that mistake: Cosmic Encounter would have been a good game even without the innovation that transcended it into a great one.

Having some way to ensure that there are no useless cards in your deck, no matter your opponent, is not a new idea, but Invasion’s developments are a particularly smart way to go about this: shore up the defenses of one of your capital zones by placing any card facedown there. Simple and elegant, and a rich source of nifty abilities that tie into this resource.

Add the fact that the six available factions are very well differentiated and reasonably balanced, and the only thing that’s not to love is that even an LCG is quite an investment compared to a normal boardgame when you commit to it. This is mitigated by the perfectly playable Core Set, but as soon as you start deckbuilding, you’ll want at least one cycle of Battle Packs and maybe another Core Set.

After 3 plays:
Resembles "Magic: the gathering", but seems to bring something beyond being a magic clone. You have to defend three zones (kingdom, quest and battlefield), instead of one, and cards may function differently in each zone.

I am not sure whether it misses the 'real' deckbuilding fun of Magic. I've only played the preselected decks yet.

I rate CCGs and their expandable cousins (LCGs, etc.) on this basis: "I will likely never invest in one again, but assuming that someone else hands me a deck here's what I think of the game."

Back when I played W:I, this was rated a 9. It's a fantastic game that, like other CCGs/LCGs, I couldn't keep up with, got out of, and will never touch again.

This is the best expandable card game I've played since Magic and V:TES, which is saying something -- I love those games. It seems to have almost as much depth as Magic, and what it lacks in depth it adds in tactical choices based on shifting conditions and how you want to use the zones.

I love the fact that you always have resources, and virtually always have something to do. On top of that, it has a great deal of depth (especially compared to some CCGs) just based on the fact that you can play most cards two ways and in any of three zones. At the same time, that doesn't lead to analysis paralysis because you don't have THAT many options every turn -- it's a great balance.

The core set approach is nice: It gives you a lot of game even if you're not interested in constructing decks. The only downside is the cards that are only provided singly or in twos, which pretty much necessitate buying two more core sets for competitive play.

The first couple plays revealed just how much there is to this game -- it's a brilliant design. I can't get over how much of a true CCG they packed into a very interesting package...without making a true CCG.

After 10 plays, I could safely say that this is one of my favorite expandable card games of all time. After more than 20, this has become my most played game since around 2000, when I stopped playing V:TES. It engages my brain in a lot of different ways, and it's a blast.

Unfortunately, it has the same glass jaw as other expandable games: time, group interest, and the availability of players who share my tastes. My group loved it for a couple months, then stopped playing it; the effort required to find other players (an easy thing back in HS and college, not so easy now), and to keep up with the game, combined with the money involved, makes it a tricky proposition. This will likely be the last game of this type I ever buy into.

Initial day - October 7.  Regular decks and draft.  First impression is it hits the spot between Magic and Harry Potter.  Personal recommendation is to play the pre-constructed decks to learn the game only.

With more games, drafts and variation the game moves from an 8 to 9.  Right there with Magic in my book.  Some amazingly tense back and forth style games.

Up to 2 expansions and the draft is working great.  This game may be better than Magic.  It greatly lessens the resource problems of magic - mana screw/glut.  It also lets you use cards you don't need now to do other things - developments.  This game needs more cards and more deck choices to take king of the CCGs away from Magic though.

Latest thoughts (2013) - not seeing play due to other great 2P games - A:NR has fired this for us.  Doesn't change the fact that it is a good game

RATING: 7
I consider this a 5 as it was shipped but with the solo rules its an 9. Playing solo makes for a more cinematic experience and allows me to remove some of the complex cards that tend to create confusion or just slow down the game.

I consider this a much more enjoyable and Thematic solo experience than the LOTR LCG, which is too long! Difficult,  and mathy for my tastes.

RATING: 10
Best of the LCG games and one of the best card games around. The LCG format means you need skill building decks and playing instead of who spends more money to get cards in CCGs.

I highly suggest this game to any fan of CCGs. It will make you want to leave most of them behind.

Not counting a brief experimenting with M:tG a hundred years ago, I'm a newbie to the whole CCG/LCG business, so I can't really compare W:I to anything. On it's own right it's a decent deck building game, so naturally it requires quite a few plays to know the cards, and be able to start thinking about forming strategies and customizing decks. The system itself flexible enough. With the multi-purpose cards and the capital board you're always able to do something meaningful, so it's almost impossible to stuck with a bad hand. Informative, well laid-out cards, intuitive gameplay, good variety, it covers all my *CG needs.

I've decided I could never buy Warhammer: Invasion because of the frequency of new cards being released. The completionist in me would always want to keep my set updated, and I just can't afford that. Luckily though I have friends that own it so I will always have opportunities to play with them. It is a lot of fun, but in my most recent plays I can see the gap growing between the player who knows the cards well and the player who is reading most of them for the first time while playing. Despite that though, the gameplay is fast and fun, there are many unique aspects other than battle, and I would always be willing to play.

RATING: 4
I think it's possible that my rating is slightly suppressed because I didn't grasp the strategies right away (even by the admittedly low standards of my addled brain). I'm afraid that card games don't feel real and immediate to me the way that board games with dice and counters/minis do, even when well done. In terms of the overall quality, it's probably in the 5 range. But the lack of immersion pushes my personal rating down to 4. I'll admit that I was tired when I played it and may not have given it a fair shake. However, based on what I've seen, I'm not inclined to go out of my way to give it another chance. So make of that what you will.

Not yet played, but will comment on the fact that you need to have 3x copies of the core game in order to be able to deck-build as you want. This is so hypocritical considering that the idea of LCGs is that you shouldn't need to spend a lot of money buying random things to get what you want, and then they skimp out on the core box forcing you to buy 3 copies of it.

This was my first LCG purchase. I had it in my head that this would be like a board game. But, since you still have to build your deck before hand it requires too much effort on the part of my friends. However, we ARE going to all play Netrunner as in, own our own collections and have decks built before we play, just as in our CCG days.

If you want to spend the hours memorizing what each race can do, and then building decks and altering your playstyle to counter each stratgey each race (and each race combo) can take, this game is for you.  Because seriously, that's what you need to do.  Each race has it's own special powers and tricks it can do, and if you don't specifically play (and build a deck) to counter those tricks, you'll be totally screwed.  

This isn't a game for me. But I can see some people digging it.

Warhammer: Invasion ist ein Living Card Game und spielt im Warhammer Fantasy Universum. Die Spieler entscheiden sich für unterschiedliche Fraktionen wie Dunkelelfen, Imperium, Orks oder Chaos und versuchen die gegnerische Stadt zu vernichten. Der Clou an Warhammer Invasion ist, dass man jede Karte auf drei unterschiedliche Arten spielen kann, nämlich je nachdem an welche Seite der eigenen Stadt sie gelegt wird. Links sorgen siefür zusätzliche Ressourcen, rechts für mehr Karten und oben wird gekämpft. Dabei muss man darauf achten, dass alle drei Seiten ausreichend gut geschützt sind, denn sobald 2 von 3 Seiten brennen, hat man verloren. Das Spielprinzip ist erfrischend anders und es gibt viel zu überlegen und zu taktieren. Leider sind die Fraktionen in der Grundbox nicht ganz ausbalanciert- Spielmaterial und Artwork ist fantastisch!

My first real foray into the Warhammer Universe.  What can I say?  As a fan of MTG (from the early days), this really scratches a new itch.  The system is simple, tight and yet full of flavor.  Artwork is good and captures the theme. It reminds me "just a bit" of Dragon Dice in the attack/defend three areas, but is much easier to learn and play.  Although it has not invoked the thirst for discovering new combos, the longing for key cards or hours of just thinking about gameplay that MTG delivered (oh, so many years ago) for me--it has a much tighter theme and that fits nicely in the Warhammer World IMHO. I am very interested to see how this game unfolds.

RATING: 5.8
Really, FFG?  This is the best you can do after DECADES of CCG-ness?  Eric Lang dominates with CitOW and then he issues this tepid nonsense?  Has any fan of this game played Legend of the Five Rings?  Because that's the game this one is based on; it just doesn't have the license W:I does.  L5R, while not perfect, has a bunch of original, thematic mechanics W:I lacks. Like Lang's Cthulhu game, W:I doesn't feel very Warhammery (in the same way that Warhammer Online fails in its Warhammery-ness.) 

Also, some of the mechanics don't make sense.  Hammers=hits.  Cool, got that.  But in the non-Battleground areas, they also translate into resources or cards.  So how does a Warrior in a Quest area translate into a card, or in the Kingdom area provide a resourse?  Sure, it's an elegant system, but there's no story to it.  The badges are much the same way.  Sometimes you have to pay an extra resource or two if you don't have enough racial badges in your display, but after Turn 3 this ceases to be any concern at all.

You'd expect a CCG released in 2009 to RADICALLY have improved on the CCG system, but W:I just hasn't.  I'm sure it will be popular and sell well, just like the GoT and CoC CCGs, but I can't imagine anyone who cut their teeth on Magic, NetRunner, or L5R to spend any time on this.  Which is really too bad, because I know Lang has it in him, but maybe the CCG game system isn't where his particular genius shines.

A descent two player game, but since I'm not that much a fan of deckbuilding, the gain of buying more and more battlepacks fades a bit away. In my opinion The Lord of the Rings - The Living Cardgame profits a lot more from being a LCG.

RATING: 6
After two games (one using the core set and the other adding in expansions) I must say that I am impressed by the possibilities of Warhammer: Invasion.  I like the mix of deck building, resource management, card management, combos, and (of course this being Warhammer) conflict.  I do have some reservations about the game having game-changing (or breaking?) "Wrath of God" cards that are way too powerful, but I'll need to delve deeper into the game to confirm that.  The other issue I have is that the core game and first several expansions did not come with three cards each which puts a crimp on building competive decks.  In any case this game is a blast to play.  Update: Balancing issues seem to occur with each new expansion as one faction gets a way overpowered card and the others get weaker cards.  I get my butt kicked everytime I play because I'm not keeping up with the newest releases.  I'm sure I'd like the game more playing the draft variant.

Pros:  Captures the flavour of the universe and has a nice rule set.

Cons:  No solitaire option.  Disappointing but understandable given the format of the game.  i.e.; head-to-head combat rather than 'questing'.

The three capital zones are the only interesting feature of the game, which is otherwise an MTG wannabe with loads of timing issues and reliance on FAQs. Plus cards, despite their nice artwork, are too (key)wordy and busy-looking from the very base set.

RATING: 7
Another Living Card Game from FFG, notable for a couple of innovations.  First cards can be used to provide additional resilience to your defenses if played face down in a region.  This can lead to some tough decisions on how to use each card in your hand.  Next, where you place your character is important in providing defense in one of three regions (victory occurs by destroying all 3 regions for your opponent) but also in how that character helps you achieve your aims.  Characters in the forward region are allowed to attack one of your opponent's three regions.  Characters in the right region allow you to draw more cards.  Characters in the left region allow you to have more gold to buy more characters/events.  Having three different regions to defend gives an advantage to the attacker that does not exist in other LCGs, which cuts down on stalemates.  Replacing mana with a single currency eliminates mana screwage/flooding.  Despite these positives, there are not an abundance of tough decisions which knocks it down a bit.

Wow!  After a straight 10hour marathon with this base game and the Assault on Ulthuan expansion, I can definitely say this game is good... VERY good.  Building up your army, distributing resources, keeping up your hand size, determining when to play certain cards, managing your three capital zones, monitoring and reacting to your opponent... There's SO many decisions to make and trade-offs to consider that it never feels dry and there's never any downtime.

All six races released thus far have their own unique strategies and play style while seeming balanced for the most part (those Dark Elves are really cruel).  I haven't felt this joy since I first discovered Magic.

Comments for core set only, where this turns out to be quite a nice card game. Your main decisions each turn are which cards to put into play given what you can afford with your limited money - into your kingdom zone (which will earn you more money each turn), into your quest zone (which will earn you more cards each turn), both of which are in effect building your economic engine, or do you forsake your engine and place cards into your battle zone. Which you'll have to do eventually and with some conviction, as you get one attack each turn and you win the game by getting the required amount of damage on your opponent's board (which is generally that which goes undefended, or that which is left over after all defenders are shot down). Cards generally are better suited to one zone over the others given the special actions they provide, so the decisions aren't intimidating. There's lots of variety in how you go about things, both inside each deck and between playing different decks against each other. The games are nonetheless quick, and if there's an easy win due to good card combos coming early, it's got a sense of "let's go again".

This game is quite interesting. It is a card driven battle with custom made decks (or simply decks out of the box), but is sold with expansions each including fixed cards instead of the costly booster packs of most games of this type. you have to defend three areas of your base and placing units or other items in those areas help you get more resources or cards each turn. To win, you must cause enough damage to the opponents base in two of the three areas. Looking forward to playing this some more.

Easy to learn and play. Hard to master type of game. Feels more like a tactical war game than a Magic the gathering type of card game (though it certainly has that kind of interaction in it).

Game plays excellent even without tons of expansions. Warhammer Invasion surprised me with how good it actually is. I would recommend investing a little bit into expansions just for the sake of variety. The LCG format for card games is much much better than the money pit that is the CCG genre.

edit: The more I play this the more I love it. I can play this all night! One of my all time favorites. I just don't get to play it as often as I like.

Edit: sold my whole set of cards. Love this game and will play it anytime, but that was the issue. The person I use to play it with isn't around to play it anymore. No one else will give it a try (some because of theme and others because they don't want to get sucked into yet another card game). It's not playable solo so Instead of having it take up valuable shelf space I sold it. Hope a computer version becomes available.

RATING: 8
Nice mechanics, looks good, plays well. The only downside is that I already have the other two LCGs so I have no interest in buying this. Quite enjoyable though.
The other disturbing thing is that this is not for casual play, you really have to build your own decks and know how to balance the decks..

A good game for those familiar with CCGs in general, because that's what it essentially is: a self-contained CCG with interesting mechanics and meaningful choices.  However, its CCG nature means that it's a little hard for some people - the so-called casual boardgaming crowd- to break in to

If you're one of those people and a fan of the Warhammer Fantasy universe, I feel it's worth the investment of time and energy for you to take the effort to learn how these games work.  Like we say in Go: lose your first fifty games quick.

RATING: 6
The best LCG that FFG has come out with.  I may be biased as a Warhammer fan, but despite that, it's fast, fun and very engaging.  Some great strategy elements and deckbuilding, coupled with fairly speedy play time make this a great pick up and play game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Good LCG. I got this to build limited price controlled decks with the family, and so far this seems to be the game that best fits the idea I wanted. The text on the cards seems to be pretty straightforward, and not as complicated as other card games I have seen. I had no issues playing this with my 8 year old. The artwork is very nice, and I will definitely try to get the rest of the family involved in playing this. I do have the base game and several of the expansions, but I have them separate so I can review those in detail later.

tho i give it a solid 8, it's still a card game which means this 3 big problems:
1) you need at least someone else owning it and building her or his own deck
2) you needED time to go through all the new cards that WERE coming out
3)you needED a lot of money to buy all the expansions with the cards that you wanted , otherwise it was a long job of writing/printing your owns

I have to compare this game to Netrunner and Magic (MtG).

Compared to MtG: 
+ More interesting choices 
+ No mana screw
+ You can buy the whole thing for the cost of modern deck
- Out of print
- Potential balance problems
- Twice as long to play

Compared to Netrunner:
+ Much easier to teach
- No bluffing/yomi element
- Warhammer theme 
- Out of print
- Deck construction is much less fun

RATING: 6
Rating after 2 plays.  Another step in the CCG/LCG improvement curve.  Scratches the CCG itch with a great theme.

Worries:
Seems very difficult to come back after losing character advantage.

3 capital areas are quite abstract.

Much of the time, the deck plays itself with one clear best move.

Broke it out after basically forgetting I owned it, and was surprised at how well it held up.  I'm not particularly crazy about deck building (which is, unfortunately, a prereq for really getting the most out of LCG's), but the base decks are really fun, and capture the mood and drama of a game of Warhammer.  I'll probably seek out the expansions on the cheap so that I can one day play a full Undead or Lizardman deck...
A pleasant surprise.

RATING: 6
Fun at first but card battle games like this need constant expansions to keep them interesting and this one suffers greatly from badly designed expansions.

A solid design in how each faction has a distinctive identity and a unique play style.
Evocative artwork fits the theme well. Too bad the follow through on this game has been so lacking, its a waste of a great setting. 

Updated {lowered rating} - Ongoing balance issues with some races getting over powered cards in new expansions while others receive poor cards, and rules on new cards introduced continue to be unclear with sloppy wording ruin this game's fun.

I like it very much, best LCG after Netrunner for me. The core set alone is good, but the game starts to shine with Deluxe sets. Packs definitely add very much and complete it - mostly the last cycles.

The game has good mechanics and it's simple and fast but quite deep with constant strategic/tactic choices.

The cards are a bit thin and the layout has no external border (a pity), while the artwork is good, but not as good as the old Games Workshop's one - at least for me.

I have two starter sets and all the expansion packs and Deluxe sets.

Great Game.  Reminds me of the things I liked about MTG.  Does not have any of the things that I disliked about that game.  Factions each have a unique feel.  Assuming they get a good FAQ out and keep the cards coming this will be my go to game for scratching the CCG itch.

Edit.  I have done a poor job of logging all my plays.  Safe to say this is getting the lion's share of my playing time in Q1 2010.  Up .5 based on the continued development of the game.

So far, I like it.  Instant play out of the box.  You can bypass the instructions and just go straight to the 5 instructional videos on Youtube from Fantasy Flight.  They do a great job of explaining it enough to get into your first game.

We played 3 games with the core set.  The Dwarves seem very overpowered but overall it was interesting.  I'm eager to get some of the expansion sets.

It will also be interesting to make some combo decks between the factions.

RATING: 8
Played a few games now and I'm impressed by the variability. I'm enjoying the tension between offence vs defense, and balancing the three zones. And I gotta say, dwarves versus orcs is a lot more balanced than empire versus orcs.

It's a winner with my wife, and with a casual gamer buddy, so I won't have any shortage of opponents. I may even try my hand a little deck building.

Just not a good game. GW often has a great ideas for theri theme and game concepts, but when it comes to designing gameplay, they fail in the execution. Like they want to appeal to an audience as wide as possible, but insulting everybodies intelligence with its shallowness, blandness and lack of direction. And even the most impulsive buyers (who'll probalby stop falling for this the last) will leave this game as soon as something else that shines, comes about. If you don't choose, you lose.

Ok, so this game is almost exactly like MtG. The only problem is, I can't find anyone to play it with me. 

It's going up for trade as much as I hate to do it. I hate having games on my shelf that don't see play.

Update:

So I've traded it away. I'm sad, but I got a good game in it's place. I hope that I get to play it again in the future. Maybe I'll be lucky enough to find someone who is in my area that owns it and loves it.

I'm really interested in this game. However, it's not likely to see any  2 player play time since my wife didn't have fun with her first play. It was on the trade pile for a while until I discovered [thread=802308]Mermuse's Solitaire Rules Variant on BGG[/thread] and here: [url=http://mermuse.jmwebdesigns.com/post/WI_solitaire_sm.pdf]Mermuse PDF Solitaire Rules[/url]. Unless otherwise noted, all of my plays, except the first, are solitaire plays using these rules.

With just the core set the solitaire rules provide a fun experience. However, much of the challenge from the AI enemy using the solitaire rules should come from stacking the AI deck with tough cards. My initial plays were fun enough, even without a tough challenge, that I'm strongly considering buying some of the expansions to increase the challenge. If I don't I'll likely have to trade the game away as I don't think it will have much replayability with just the core deck.

The theme & mechanics of the base game, coupled with the potential the variant solitaire rules offer have me strongly considering investing in this non-solitaire system. Scary. 

A few comments on the game itself without regard to the solitaire variant.
:d10-1: I find I really enjoy the artistic quality of the cards.
:d10-2: The little I've been exposed to the relationships between the cards is very interesting. The potential card play once expansions are incorporated seems likely to offer much fun and replayability.
:d10-3: Seemingly quick gameplay for a thematic fantasy game is an attractive quality.

Very playable card game reminiscent of Magic: the Gathering and the other Warhammer CCG called Warcry. I used to play quite a lot if Warcry a few years back and this nicely brings the Warhammer world back to card games. Looking forward to getting all the expansions. LCG is a better way of getting the cards from CCG but somehow I miss the excitement of opening the booster packs.

I love the game, but I hate the meta-game in this LCG. The rating for core set only would be a 6. If you'll find partners competitive enough to buy expansions and, well, make the game living, but not enough to treat tournament play seriously and focus on getting best possible deck, try it.

Theme looks great. I love the whole idea of all those different races and their playstyles. Unfortunately this game doesn't deliver as much as I'd hoped. I really want to like it, but it feels...unfinished, while the four races seem somewhat balanced in this core set. It's not the fact that I haven't got any of the expansion packs.

It's just not entirely thought-out; they way you build up your force feels odd to me, and you get a pretty 'kiddy' way of combat. the quest system seems totally unnecessary and could have easily been left out. I don't really like it, although I really want to like it. Might give it a few more tries though, since the theme still feels awesome and enchanting, but the tactics feel way to easy and non-existent. Maybe it's more appropriate for younger children or newcomers to card battle systems.  

I'll give it a few more goes though! Since I really like the theme!

Edit: Sold it off.

8.5.10 - (34 plays) This game continues to impress right out of the box. Core set decks aren't as involved as decks built from multiple expansions, but they still manage to do pretty well.

8.18.12 - (48 plays) This is a solid game but it has just suddenly lost its appeal to me. Maybe because I really don't like the Warhammer setting. I certainly don't regret buying this and playing it almost 50 times. I probably won't play it much more though and may get rid of it. Downed the rating from a 9 to a 7.

Warhammer: Invasion is mechanically interesting and elegant, but the cards in the base set do not make good use of the design space. This is what turns me away from many LCGs and CCGs, since they require large card pools to build interesting and cohesive decks. The 3 zones add an interesting dynamic that is missing from Magic, but the cards are not interesting enough to get me into the game.

[BGCOLOR=#A0A0FF][COLOR=#FFFFFF]xxG.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR]  I give it a 7.5 after one play. I really like the use of Power icons as a universal resource that can be applied to card draw, resources (to pay for stuff) and attack value in battle. Great theme, great art and graphic design, and a solid play experience so far. Looking forward to learning the cards and playing more. Happy to be in on a new LCG from the start, too.

Update: great game. My rating has crept up to 8.5 and will likely stay there. This game really rewards in-game decisions to a much greater extent than many other CCGs, as compared to deck-building decisions. The LCG format is easy to keep up with, too, especially now that they went to 3x per card in every pack.

Own: first two cycles plus first two deluxe expansions. Putting a hold on buying until I try the LotR LCG, as I might focus on that for a while if I like it, and especially if I get my wife to play it.

Final update: well 50+ plays later, this is a great game. I stopped buying it after 5 cycles, then the game was retired after the 6th cycle, so I might eventually pick those up to have the complete collection. Solid, solid game - a classic to keep.

Yeah, I kicked my Magic habit, but now I'm investing in this.  Why?  1.  Plays great out of the box with no further investment. 2.  The drafting rules are excellent and you only need the cards in the starter set to do the draft.  3.  The factions appear to be balanced pretty well, the game is fun, and offers lots of interesting decisions during the course of a game. 4.  If everyone in your group agrees to buy the same number of each expansion (1 for our group) - instant level playing field which never happens with randomly assorted cards.
5. Nothing revolutionary in mechanics but the designers learned well from previous games.  Having 3 zones to play cards coupled with the ability to play cards face down to fortify each zone allows you interesting choices every turn while limiting "mana screw".

Got the "Deluxe" expansion, Warhammer: Invasion - Assault on Ulthuan. Adds two races, and completes the decks for the core set factions -- there are now enough cards for 6 full factions that are fun to play. Worthy of a rating bump!

THe only tough part about this game is if your are an anal completist and you cannot sleep at night until you buy every card in the game. 
That has given me many sleepless nights. OF course on those nights I keep thinking of how I can create more interesting decks w what I own then wished I had more..... then.... you get the picture.

Like any ccg/lcg, knowing the cards is central to the game. I like that there are three areas to defend and also that you need to juggle resources, card draw, and your fighters. If I played regularly, my rating would probably go up (I know that seems like circular logic regarding ratings) but as it stands, it's about a 7.

From what we've played, this card game looks to be a nice new favorite for us.  We haven't gotten to building our own decks, but even with stock decks this offers nice choices of where to play your cards, how to take your turns, and kind of reminds me of a Warhammer themed Glory to Rome.

I really don't like these kinds of (non)CCG, micromanagement games -- trying to keep track of all the little mini modifiers and being constantly reminded of why you can't do this or that is tedious to me.  

The luck of the draw can also be crippling, which is annoying as you watch your opponent's synergy build up while you sit there twiddling your thumbs.  I'm just not inclined to become an "experienced" player -- too much niggling crud to learn in order to be a decent player.

I understand what others see in these games, I just don't appreciate them myself.

Particular to Invasion, I was also quite put off by the graphic design.  The art is fantastic, but the cards are busy, difficult to read, and the play area gets awfully cluttered quite quickly.  Having to lean over and read twelve cards to get a cursory understanding of what your opponent is up to is just a pain in the ass!

I had a bad day at work and bought this on the way home to have something new to play with my girlfriend. We are looking around for good two player games and we hadn't tried a card game with deck building yet, although I have played similar games in my youth. 
This is a game with high aggression and after the first two games the aggression was really high between her and me. The day after we played again, but in a more mellow tone. My prior experience in this type of card games gave me a 3-2 in ratio, and two of those was real fast table cleaners when she did not have a chance. She returned that favor one time. Let's face it, its isn't a fun way to win - with minimal opposition - or lose with the feeling that you weren't able to do anything about it. The other (2) games was much closer and then this game really shined. It seems that its is very good to go first as the other player really have to struggle to keep up. We will play it some more, and maybe even buy a battlepack or two for the variation.

I'm very much ambivalent about this game. This comment is mostly for my benefit so, once I sell my copy, I will know never to buy another one -- it's not really helpful for someone looking for ratings advice. The short summary is that I think it's a great game, but LCGs are like CCGs in that they require a great commitment of time and energy which I have no interest in giving.

:star::star::star:

I have fond memories of playing Magic: The Gathering. Like many recovering Magic players, one of the reasons I stopped was the realization that the random booster model was an expensive addiction I couldn't afford. The "living card game" model, then, seemed perfect. I tossed up between the first three, and since I am [i]also[/i] a recovering Games Workshop player, Invasion seemed like a good bet.

The first few plays were grand -- just the core set, mono-faction decks (which the design encourages anyway through the "loyalty" concept). There were perhaps a few balance issues. The dwarf deck didn't play in a very fun way -- a slow build that dragged out the game. But the artwork is great, the multiple areas offer some interesting placement decisions, and there are all the fun opportunities for combos that I remembered.

And, hey, there were so many great cards in the expansions. It could only get better, right?

Really, the problem is that I played Magic: The Gathering most seriously over 10 years ago. I was in school; we played every day. I could build a deck after school and test it the next day. 

Now I am not in school and I am not in a position to play Invasion every day. I'm lucky to play once a month. It's hard to maintain interest in deck-building without a feedback loop -- what they call the meta-game -- of changes to the field of competition. I win a lot with my direct-damage deck, so you make a deck which designed to stop me. If we're all doing this at once, there's a great level of grand strategy overlaying the tactical elements in each individual game. It just feels hollow.

I'd still play, but without the deck-building, what's left? The core set decks are fun, but I think a lot of the fun is in the promise of fixing them, of making a deck that exploits tactic X or tactic Y to its full potential. Without that, you're just left with a static game that I'm not sure is balanced.

And if it's just a static game, well, I have a large (by normal people's standards) collection of other games. So do most of those I play with. Tell me again why I should choose Invasion over Claustrophobia, or Confusion, or any of the others?

:star::star::star:

As a Magic: The Gathering replacement with my old Magic: The Gathering friends, I would [i]love[/i] Invasion.

As one of many two-player games with expansions I'm not in a position to use... it does not shine so brightly.

RATING: 8
This was an unexpected breath of fresh air from someone who grew disappointed in the Warhammer Fantasy game and grew tired of blindly purchasing booster packs hoping to find the right Magic card. The playing of cards into three seperate zones provides interesting strategic decisions. I also like the development mechanic which gives you something to do with cards you don't want to play. I would like to see vampire counts, tomb kings, lizardmen,Bretonnians,and Wood elves represented. I love the living card concept because it is easy on the wallet.

This is a great game and I would have given it a 9 if it weren't for a few minor problems: The rulebook has no glossary. The rulebook contradicts itself regarding the turn structure. The turn structure has holes in it. The wording on the cards is sometimes inconsistent.

The gameplay itself, however, is really good.

RATING: 6
Warhammer Invasion is a CCG-style game, not unlike Magic: the Gathering. It has a very in-depth resource management system where your creatures can be used to build up your economy instead of attacking. The out-of-the-box decks have a decent balance (more or less), although eventually the game can feel repetitive. 

Unfortunately the game's combat system is not so interesting. Defending is rarely profitable, so a lot of games degenerate into a race to see who can deal the most damage first. There isn't enough interaction between players, even during attacks. Ultimately that's damning - there are a lot of better options (such as AGoT LCG or even Magic). 

Don't be fooled by the LCG format - it's pretty much the same as CCGs. If anyone you play with buys any expansions, ultimately it's still the same old arms race.

I liked this game, but not enough to keep playing it.  I'd rather play Magic or WoW:TCG any day.  Magic theme decks do a much better job at creating a preset play environment than this box set does.

I got this back in a trade over the summer 2012.  I'm not sure what I was thinking.

RATING: N/A
Interesting quick cardgame. However, I won't see this getting playtime. First off, you need to build a deck. Which means both players should know the cards and invest time building it. Second, both sides play similar (though you might have built very different decks).

Compared to my collection, it has similarities to Mage Wars, Berserk: War of the Realms, and Android: Netrunner. Let me go into depth on each of these.

Mage Wars: clearly more complex and involved, but it comes with a VERY interesting spatial element bringing also a sense of 'empire' building other than just laying cards out to either side for their function. Plus, selecting from a spellbook is just so much cooler as drawing from the top of your deck.
Berserk: War of the Realms: Compared because it is a 2p cardgame which pits you against each other, has deck building and a fantasy war-theme. Gameplay wise it is a different beast, not necessarily better but as Berserk doesn't get playtime of itself that speaks for how much the first part is sought for.
Finally Android: Netrunner. Of course, it has a different theme, but I find that a much superior game compared to this one because of the asymmetric roles. Here, both sides play similar, which means more skilled player always wins. 

No need owning it, wouldn't mind playing it but not seeking that out either. Pass.

Gameplay similar to Magic: the Gathering, but M:tG is better.

The problem with M:tg is CCG. LCG is better, but when you want to build a tournament deck, you must buy 3x core set or buy core set 1x and buy the cards you dont have 3x. And that is the reason why my BGG rating is 5.

The game is very good and the basic mechanic both easy and full with strategical options. So, my first rating was 7,5.
Why I dropped it by 1? Because of the Faqs changing radically the rules, and the loss of balancement. At first there are unbeatable skaven/orc decks (likely because of bad balancement)? Ok, let's solve the problem by creating "invulnerable" zones thanks to a faq that changes how the game is played. Now, I foresee cards to remove the "invulnerable" units, so the game will be unbalanced again the other way, and so forth... exactly what the GW did for years with WFB.

I am kind of fond of the theme, and the gameplay is alright (though it still seems victim to having the player who draws the better set of cards being the winner), but I'm having a relatively hard time picturing the deck-building being fun.  Each race has its own gimmick, and the game promotes having you stick with one race.  It seems like every Orc deck will feel like the same Orc deck.

Dans le genre jeu de carte de bataille, il est un coche au dessus des autres car il offre plus de profondeur.

RATING: 8
Remarkably simple game play - once you grok the rules, which make things look more complex than they are here - nevertheless allows for some interesting options and tense battles. The six races (assuming you've bought the large expansion Assault on Ulthuan and have the Dark and High elves at full strength - definitely feature different play styles and the variety keeps things interesting. I think you'd have to be really hard core to continue buying expansions after the first few ... there's already plenty of options for deck building almost right away. I'm going to be interested to see how much of a strategy running your opponent out of cards becomes ... I'd rather see games end with kingdoms in flames. Also curious to see how long this holds my attention, but here in the early going I'm enjoying it and looking forward to experimenting more with the different races and doing a bit of tinkering with decks.

Never played any CCG's or LCG's before. I really enjoy playing WH:I casually without deck-building. It plays fast, gives you some nice strategic choices and is complex enough not to get boring too quickly. Races play differently as well.

Only downside for me: After buying a cpl of expansions, the game tends to be more and more luck-driven and unbalanced towards the order races..

Still a whole lot of fun, though :-).

Sadly I got this game when one of the last boxes was released. I was in my teen years and didn't have a lot of money but saw this interesting game. I played a lot of magic the gathering but was getting tired of the relatively simple way of playing the game.

So this game has your warhammer fantasy races you know and love but instead of just throwing monsters in the face of your enemy, you have to build up your kingdom, go on quests and prepare your battlefield to win over your enemy. This creates interesting thought choices as you have to pick between 3 spaces to place your cards with each different space giving a different bonus (getting more gold, getting an extra card or being able to attack).

If you don't want to buy the whole dang product line (which will leave you bankrupt due to out of production status and there being a lot of products!) then just get the core game. If you have someone to play it with, you will keep coming back for a match because of the different way of playing this game.

P.S. Dwarves feel overpowered in the core set, and I love dwarves....so thumbs up from me! :P

RATING: 7
Start box only: Will grow with expensions. To me as an experienced CCG player it feels a bit light. Easy and solid mechanics. Since every refined deck plays two cards of the starter box threefold expect to buy quite some starter boxes if you want to play several decks at the same time. I expected to get several nice decks from the start box plus the six boosters of the first cycle. Fact is that beyond the matter above there are quite a lot of other cards you would need three of a kind from to build some real tactics into your decks. In the end you need to buy multiples to get most fun out of it. But then you can go as well with some starters and boosters of magic... I would say the LCG approach sounds better than it works for me. Solid game but investment too high for me who just wants to have 6 strategic decks for less then 100 Euro. Should work better for people doing single decks only and especially for those buying some packs three times.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Even though Warhammer Invasion plays as most CCGs, a small but significant twist is that you have to decide WHERE each card played from your hand goes. Will it contribute to the amount of resources or the amount of cards you get each turn, will it be used to bolster defences, or will it be used for the attack? As such, the game offers more decisions during play than most CCGs. That is a good thing, especially for players like me who like the feel of a CCG, but do not enjoy deckbuilding.
That being said, I am a bit disappointed by the production values of this cardgame - The citadel boards and counters are typical (good) FFG quality, but cardstock is poor (very thin), and the rehashed artwork does not offer anything new to an old Warhammer afficionado like me. Also, I have yet to decide whether the relatively long playing time (1 - 1,5 hours) is a blessing or a curse for a cardgame. Therefore, rating may very well change with further plays.

Magic Light. Very interesting resource system, great artworks, and rather easy to get into for an LCG. Sadly, blocking rarely occurs and it is very hard to mount a comeback when you fall behind.
Also see my review if you are a MtG player.

I like the artwork and theme.  I wish FFG would have put some thought into a box insert.  The game play turns out to be really fun.  I like how the resources work and using upside cards as developments is great (a tip of the hat to Race for the Galaxy I think).  Some rules are a bit ambiguous, but that is to be expected to some extant in a game modeled after a CCG style game.  Just remember the golden rule that the card text overrides the rulebook.  The races also feel and play very differently.  After some more plays I am looking forward to trying the drafting varient.

RATING: 8
Probably the best LCG on the market, this game manages to combine a flexible strategies with exciting cardplay in a total package that is fun to play and feels like Warhammer. Each faction has a specific feel, and aside from Chaos (arguably) they are well-balanced.

Simply the best CCG style game available (or it was when it came out). And thank god it is sold in a non collectible format! The available options for building decks are awesome. I look forward to trying more out. Although I am a bit worried at how strong the orc rush decks are right now (mid 2010). Hopefully they will figure something out to slow this down and allow other decks a chance. Update: changed my tune on this. Can't be bothered with deckbuilding, although the game on its own is very good.

It brings back memories of my Magic: The Gathering days, but without the very high collector's cost.  It has all the same "build an awesome deck" and "kill that guy's awesome deck" that Magic had, with a totally different game under the hood.  Very good game, with a ton of cards.

Really awesome game but it takes time to understand. Only when tried to play the third time and I read the rules the fifth time, I only understoon how much actually is going on. You have so much variation and things you can do. You really need to get down to the details and crunch through them. Once that is done couple of times the game plays really easy. For convenience purposes I downloaded rules summary from FFG website forum and that helped a lot.

I am looking forward to getting the "Cataclysm" expansion to get my friends involved becuae the 2-player game is leaving out other poeple who would really want to get in on this.

Otherwise an excellent tactics and strategy LCG. Love it. And the artwork - spectacular.

This isn't my type of game, which I knew going in but didn't mind because it's short and my friend wanted to play. It's not bad for what it is, but I can't help but ask why something like this exists when there's Magic. Then again I'm not particularly fond of either, which probably explains why I feel that way. But in fairness, Magic is elegant while this just... isn't.

Warhammer: Invasion The Card Game is a two-player card game of intense warfare, clever kingdom management, and epic questing. Players must carefully allocate their resources as they seek to build their kingdom, complete quests, and attack the enemy’s capital. Games play out in 25-45 exciting minutes.

Probably the best card game I've ever played. Unfortunately it's being slaughtered by the development team who release a broken card every month or two. It's not a matter of money - I can afford the $15/month or whatever it is, but I can't keep up with the metagame changing dramatically all the time. Hopefully I can get back to it when the game cools down so to say.

By far my most played game of 2010, with 39 games of this played. It is pretty great, and the card pool, now at the end of the Enemy Cycle, has gotten pretty solid. Most factions have several different approaches to how they do their thing, and there are nice cards in each faction that fit in well with other factions of the same alignment. 
--------------------------------
Pretty fun game. Seems a bit simpler than Call of Cthulhu LCG in terms of card effects and interactions, though it seems a bit deeper in terms of actual play decisions, what with the three different zones you can choose to attack and play cards into. Looking forward to seeing how the game fleshes out with the Battlepacks and the companion set.

RATING: 7.6
I enjoy this game and feel there is plenty of crunch to it but while it works well with just the core set I feel it is just asking for expansions to be bought. I was looking for an LCG that felt 'complete' even though expansions may exist (if that exists) but none the less, I feel that for a single LCG in a box it does a reasonable job of not forcing you into buying expansions. As a MtG fan I also like this.

Battle game where you have 3 areas. The kingdom, your army, and going on quests. You spend to add cards to the areas. Your army can attack any of the opposition's areas. If you give any area 7 points of damage it bursts into flames. If you do that twice you win. I did not care for it but I cna see why others might like it.

Really, really fun game with great production values. 

Warhammer: Invasion marries a crunchy, interesting setting with fantastic gameplay. Despite the fact that the rules are easy to learn, they contain a surprising amount of subtle depth and nuance. The resource-managment aspects of each game-turn remind me of managing an economy in a Real-Time Strategy video game and they help Warhammer: Invasion avoid the dreaded "Mana Screw/Flood" issue that plagues Magic: The Gathering. (Perhaps "plagues" is a bit too alarming a term to use in describing that particular gameplay issue for M:tG but it IS one of Magic's known issues.)

As one of FFG's LCGs (Living Card Games), it's a fixed-purchase rather than a Blind or Collectible purchase and this makes the game fairly affordable to jump into, presuming you don't want to own everything all at once.

Overall, this is nearly a perfect game and one of my all-time favorite games.  A smash home-run for Eric Lang and for my money, the best of the Living Card Games overall.  Highly, HIGHLY recommended.

I must say I really like the "living card game" idea! An opportunity to play some games with a CCG feel but with a fixed set of cards and expansions. My pockets are just not deep enough to keep buying MTG boosters though I do think MTG is a great game which has been soured for some by the collectable aspect. Nice one FFG!

A good confrontational card game that is a little unbalanced out of the box. We picked this up for £10 at a bring and buy, may grab a few battle packs down the line to help the chaos deck.

This is really good with more cards the deck building is fun and the games are about the same tempo as magic. I like it.

I really like this game, but am upset at FFG's decision to not include 3 copies of each card, making the only way to get all the cards buying three copies of the base game, and then being stuck with a bunch of cards you cannot use.

I own the following expansion cycles:
(5) The Bloodquest Cycle
(6) The Eternal War Cycle

I own all deluxe expansions:
Assault on Ulthuan (110 cards in 1-2-3 card distribution)
March of the Damned (55x3 cards)
Legends (55x3 cards)
Cataclysm (53x3 cards)
Hidden Kingdoms (56x3 cards)

I don't own these expansion cycles:
(1) The Corruption Cycle (own 1st ed. [1-2-3] Tooth and Claw)
(2) The Enemy Cycle
(3) The Morrslieb Cycle
(4) The Capital Cycle

Would love to rate higher, except that crappy wordage on far too many cards, fights against my love for some of the interesting game mechanisms W:Invasion possesses.

Also, a few of the factions have Wrath of God style card destruction capabilities, while the, supposedly, destructive forces of chaos are allowed only to tap cards (sorry, corrupt). Huge disparities in faction balance, drain my initial enthusiasm for this product.

All that said, I do like the game.

I like this game mostly because I grew up on Warhammer. The artwork is really nice and the way the game is set up with quest areas, battlefields and your capital city etc, you really feel like you're fighting a war for your kingdom, unlike MTG or something where you're just randomly battling some dude for no obvious reason....

It's a novel game which I enjoy but it's too simple for me and it has some really odd mechanics, plus many of the cards effects are very plain. Reminiscent of very early MTG: Lots of creatures with no special abilities.

If you're buying it looking for a simple game that will immerse you in the Warhammer world then it's a good buy. If you want an LCG with depth, look elsewhere - I'd recommend Netrunner!

My CCG fix in a more reasonable package. Actually I really prefer this game to any CCG I've previously tried or owned.
I'd say that up until now it's the best customizable card game for 2 players I've ever played. My only problem with it is the fact that if you want to stick to one core set (and eventually one of each big box expansions) for a couple of players (that's my case), then Support cards become unbalanced as there are really few ways to destroy them (the Orks is the only race that has a fair number of support-destroyers).

Update (Jun 2013): I must say that after Netrunner I've completely lost interest in this. I still play it because the buddy that bought the sets with me loves it and pushes to play, but it honestly feels clunky and uninspired compared to Netrunner. For a fantasy cardgame fix I'd rather play Summoner Wars (but my buddies seem to have problems with movements, grids and dice) or try Mage Wars.

This is a game I could play for a while. After playing 3 rounds I started getting the hang of it but that is not until someone sat down with me and showed me how to play. I suggest that if you want to learn how to play, watch the video tutorial on Fantasy Flight's website or find someone who already knows how to play. I live near Fantasy Flight and learned how to play at their hobby shop. An employee told me to toss the rule book and have someone show me. 

This is not my first choice of games I want to play, however it is definitely fun. More fun if you are familiar with the Warhammer universe but not alienating to people that have no idea what Warhammer is.

Plays very much like Mtg but it has more tactical options than M:TG since you have three zones to look out for. The resource generation is less frustrating than Mtg. Out of the 5 LCG I played this is the most simple. It's also the most quick to play.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.3
3 copies

Probably as close to perfection as a CCG has come, so far (in my opinion, of course).

I will admit that part of the rating I gave this game comes from the fact that the LCG formula is everything I have ever wanted from CCGs (having played tons of CCGs ever since Magic, and having spent thousands of dollars, a CCG that costs me 15$/month is the best thing since sliced bread; also, some CCGs become a bit stale when you have to wait 4+ months between expansions, so having a new set every month keeps things fresh and interesting).

If you look at it strictly from a boardgame perspective, then it would be slightly more expensive than a traditional card-based game. Also, since the core set and the first 6 expansions didn't yet use the new LCG formula where you get an entire playset in just one box, it could still end up being pretty pricey for "completionists".

Addendum: not really playing anymore, unfortunately, as I'm having trouble finding opponents. I've also pretty much replaced this with Netrunner, but I still enjoy the universe and theme immensely.

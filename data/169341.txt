A really light filler, but a very welcoming one. The art is pleasant, the gameplay has a little bit of thinking to it, and it scales well from 2 to 7 players. The solo variant is also pretty decent as well.

The sort of game you could break out over Sunday morning coffee with friends and family. May work well with children too.

RATING: 7
A stunningly beautiful filler that is easy to teach and accessible to anyone. The birding theme is original and ties in nicely.

With less than four players you need dummy hands, which is a bit tedious. I'd recommend only playing with 4+.

RATING: 9
A delightfully adaptable game.  Quick and easy to learn, even the single player variant is fun (though I prefer playing with 4-7 people).  The artwork is beautiful and the flexibility to use the raptor rule and some drafting keeps things interesting after many games.

Birds of a Feather was highly recommend by one of the permanent members of the Dice Tower as their big surprise of 2016. After tracking down a copy and getting it to the table I'm just not seeing it. While its not a terrible game I feel it would be better with more then three players. I'd try this game again, so we will see what happens.

RATING: 7
First play with my family was really quite good. Very charming, fairly intuitive. Rating could go up if more strategy reveals itself or, conversely, if it works with my 5-year-old niblings (who love and totally get Sushi Go).  It has that "Sushi Go" feeling of being light, non-offensive, and getting played a few times every time we bring it out.

[i]At the time of this recording the oldest table topper is 5 and the youngest is 3.9 years old.[/i]

This is my most played game over the Christmas holidays of 2014 and is often requested by my tiny table toppers. Players simultaneously ([b]simultaneous action selection[/b]) choose bird cards from their hands ([b]hand management[/b]) that allow them to trek to different habitats to view them in the wild. Some birds are extremely rare and players must respond quickly if they are to catch a glimpse of these elusive birds before they fly away. Players are rewarded for all of the different types of birds that they see and receive bonus points for seeing all the birds of a particular habitat ([b]set collection[/b]).

A very light [b]social deduction[/b] element is introduced to the game as you try to leverage your bird watching goals with others. 

This game is the perfect marriage between two fascinating hobbies with seamlessly integrated mechanics that are thematically intuitive.

This is a great little card game. Cards are beautiful and the gameplay is simple. There is a nice balance between luck (drawing of cards) and strategy (your choice of cards to play), with strategy winning out over luck. A very nice relaxing game for 1 to 7 players. Can play with kids and adults. Games are quick, so can play as a filler, but it is a game you can play multiple times in a row. It is also a great "lunch" game because how quick it sets up, plays, and cleans up. I will be bringing it with me on trips (we live on an island and have to take a 1 hour or a 2 1/4 hour boat trip to go any where). Everyone should have this game in their collection.

Bought this game because a friend of mine is a bird watcher. Bought it just because of the theme, and didn't have high expectations beforehand. But it is actually a very nice game! Unique theme, beautiful artwork, very portable, easy rules and good for playing with non-gamers, quick games, and I really like the mechanics. A positive surprise!

A set collection game with the twist that you score by matching cards with other players, or with cards played in a previous trick. There's a slick scoresheet app too. The beautiful bird artwork takes it to the next level for me--as a birder, this game will always have a place in my collection.

This game ranks up there with Hana-bi as one of my favorite small, simple games. It's fast and easy to learn, but still involves enough strategy to make it very replay-able. Not only that, it's beautiful (and educational)! I love introducing other people to this game.

Gameplay is light as a feather (couldn't resist). But seriously, there's not lots to think about on your turn with this game, but I find it quite a pleasant game to play with the family. In that way I guess it fits the theme of birding -- not exciting, but quite pleasant.

A game about bird-watching!  There's actually a fun little game here wrapped around a somewhat educational experience.  I like the art and I like seeing the different kinds of birds in different habitats.  The dye colors were "off" for my blue cards though.  Also, the score sheet had an error.  I know the manufacturer wants us to use the app, but it's sort of a drag to try and tell everyone to download this app before the game starts.  

I can look past these things though and recommend this unique game.

This light game about bird watching in various environments is surprisingly fun with optional depth in some variant rules.  I love how gameplay simulates bird watching with all players playing a card and then peacefully, silently, watching the birds and taking notes about what they've seen.  It's so much like the real thing!  Solo play is a welcome, and fun addition.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

I'd play this again as it plays quickly but I'm not sure its something that really interests me. There is some luck of the draw and little that can be done - it is not good to be shortsuited - especially if played with the raptor variant. Easy to teach and play though and pleasant enough - just not memorable. I wouldn't play with 2 and 3 isn't likely optimal although it works with a ghost player. I think the pass cards variant or draft would likely make the game better.

I knew nothing about this one except that it was a filler game about Bird Watching, say what? Well, at least it's a pretty different theme! :p

And I have to say this is another very cool filler game... it plays fast and you, once again have some cool decisions to make when selecting what card to play each turn and what you should save.

This game is easy to pick up, plays well with 1-4 players (haven’t played beyond that),  and is so fun to look at! Suprisingly strategic for such a simple game with the “lingering bird” mechanic—definitely some important choices to make based on what you have in your hand and what you think your fellow birders will do. Recommend for a filler or just a chill, replayable card game.

This is a fantastic set collection game. The artwork and the game play is thematic and wonderful. I do think you should play with passing cards at the start of the game at a minimum. As long as everyone has played before, then drafting your cards would help take some of the luck out.

I thought there might be more second guessing, but the game is mostly obvious plays.  Just play the card that will get you the most stuff, then hope that you get lucky towards the end of the hand.  Also, count cards.

With 2-3 player, there are dummy players that play at random, which is especially bad for a game that is about second guessing.  Very random!  Don't play with fewer than 4!

The art is pleasing, and this might be an accessible and pleasant game to play with bird watchers who don't play many games.  This could also work well as a family game, except that bird watching is a pretty boring topic for most kids.

This is very fun card game that really feels like bird watching.  Simple rules, but a lot of interaction actually.  The luck of the draw does not really play a factor which is cool.  I won a game having not a single card of one of the colors.

I backed this one on kickstarter because it was made by the same guy that made on of my favorite games, [thing=125943][/thing].  The theme of the game is birdwatching, and every card has a beautifully illustrated bird from the northern California area (illustrations are done by the designer's brother which is pretty cool).

It's a really simple card game where there are 5 different habitats and each habitat has 7 different birds of varying rarity, and each card has a habitat and a bird type.  Each turn everyone simultaneously plays a card, which represents where you go to bird watch.  You see your bird and any other birds played from the same habitat.  The birds then stick around for one more turn, so next turn you can go to a different habitat where there were a lot of birds.  You each have a score sheet and check off the birds as you see them.  You get bonus points for seeing all the birds in the same habitat.

I'm very pleased with this one.  The theme is unique and the cards are beautiful.  It would be great with kids, casual gamers, or anyone that likes birds.  After my first play I thought it was all luck, but I think there is definitely some strategy.  For the heavier gamers, you can add in drafting, card passing, or other variants.  There are a few minor printing errors, but they don't bother me.

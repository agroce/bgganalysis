Must be one of the best looking games ever. The figures require absolutely no filing, sanding or cutting to remove residual material. They are ready for painting as they are. The sculpts are also great.

The game itself is a quite straightforward shoot and roll frenzy, which is fun. I just didn't like the victory conditions of the scenarios. You gain VPs from controlling certain spaces on the board at the end of your turn. This makes the early game a race for those spaces in which the starting player has an advantage. After that it is a tugwar until the very end. Deploy troops, send a wave of them to capture enemy controlled VP bunkers, roll dice and hope for a kill. You are just sending a wave after wave until one player has been lucky enough to dodge more dice than the other.

I also did not fancy the constant deployment of new troops every turn. The game would be much more strategic if you had to pick your troops at the beginning and had to play with those. 

The game has potential but the scenarios and the rules for troop redeployment are dull. Wait for fan created scenarios or make house rules of your own.

Does not play very well with just the basic boxed game. This game needs more variety to be very fun, especially if it is to go retail.

And now they are tired of trying to get the 'cool mini's' to look perfect and are going to settle for 3rd best....

I am going to start calling this publisher 'Not', since they are not "Cool Mini'!

I played this game just twice, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

Like every CMON title Rivet Wars is really a beautifully produced game. The miniatures are particularly spectacular in my opinion, being so big and chunky, and I also like the cartoony take for the artwork. Yet, while there's much to love about the components, I must say I was a little disappointed by the game-play.

As I approached the game for the first time, I had very high hopes. I really wanted to like it, because I've been searching for quite some time for a fun WW-themed light miniature game with something that would spice things up (like different factions, units with special abilities, card play and so on). This looked like it could be that game. Then little by little I sadly found out things I didn't like about it: such as the choice of bringing your units on the board little by little instead of having a planning set-up phase or the strong focus on the heroes but even worse the high level of randomness that characterizes the game.

Maybe my expectations were set too high, because I was comparing  in my mind this game with Battlelore (Second Edition), which is one of my favorite games of all time. Here the lack of control over the results of my actions really bothered me. In Battlelore, even if you get a bad dice roll, there's usually a way to gain at least something positive out of it (like some lore, or activating an ability or making your enemy retreat). This is not true in this game, where high rolls are always better than low rolls and therefore 3 sides out of 6 of each die are completely useless.

Now, that being said, I didn't really disliked the game. It's a fine product and it delivers some light miniature fun... I just wanted more and, for this reason, I can't unfortunately say that I enjoyed Rivet Wars very much. Not a bad game, but probably forgettable.

A solid two player game. 
Being able to have troops deploy each turns allows you to counter most things the enemy is planning. 
The rules are simple, and the game play picks up fast with deaths happening almost every turn.

Personally, I really enjoy this game.  Its a very quick, light war game.  Turns happen fast and a whole game rarely goes beyond 15 or 20 minutes.  It really manages to capture not only the feel of a traditional computer based RTS but of WWI combat in general as you send wave of wave of men after a single objective.

This effectively Advance Wars the Board Game.
I really want to say that I love it, because I love Advance Wars, but it just feels bland. It's really like they made these beautiful miniatures and then just made a system that functions. The game was incredibly swing-ey and we could typically tell who was going to win within the first two or three rounds. It always felt like a gradual grind to victory instead of a tense battle.

It's not... bad? It just is. This a game, that exists, and I played. It was okay.

Nice light wargames/tower defense with some simple rules, stunning art and awesome figures. Looking forward to official faq since some of the special powers need some clarifications. The game is fast, but not sure that is actually a good thing. Can be rather punishing in some aspects with it being too easy to lose a strategic point and just see the opponent rake in the VPs.
Looking forward to expansions and to see if the scenarios hold up to repeated plays.

Ok, let me say that this game rocks my socks. And it shouldn't. It is light, it is luck driven by dice and card draws. But it is also easy to teach and understand. It is very atmospheric and aesthetically people by and large like the looks of the game (despite it tackling a very dark and horrendous period of warfare and puts a "cute" spin on it). I like that every turn you just summon up what you want to start charging battle, I like that to win you usually have to get aggressive and attack the middle of the battlefield. I like the way the plugs work to augment bigger vehicles. I like that so much has special rules and abilities. It is a bit of a mess of a game but it is truly a shining example of what I look for and what from my games.

Yet another example of being a good artist doesn't necessarily mean you can make a good game.

The game isn't terrible, but it's also not any good.  For all the wonderful art design that went into this thing, the gameplay is unrewarding and ridiculously unbalanced.  I honestly can't tell who the target audience for this game is.  At the price point, it's certainly not for kids, and for adults, there's just not a whole lot here.  I honestly would have been more happy if these little figures were simply gacha prizes or something as they are fun to look at and have a lot of visual appeal.  

I honestly believe the rating comes from backer regret (as most KS game ratings, go) as the system is simple, yet chaotic.  There's hardly any tactics involved, despite the game being "tactical".  Put your guys up front and pray to RNGesus.  Even simple fun like Advance Wars' RPS matchups would have gone a long way to make Rivet Wars fun.  If all you really want to do is throw units at each other and forget about the outcome, then yes, there is something to behold, but at that point, you don't even need players at the table.

To preface this, we did play the game wrong all four times. Thinking only infantry could enter duckboards (trapping most other units outside the strategic areas); however, I can still safely say this was a stinker.

Games end so quickly because grabbing VPs occurs from just entering an area on the board, that I often wonder what the point of saving up "money" to buy costly units that only see action in maybe the last turn of the game. The varied action and mission cards adds needed variety, but are WAY imbalanced (on one turn my opponent gets a card awarding a free vehicle, I get a card that negates its movement for one turn... um OK). The targeting grid is sooo wonky, it causes some attacks to be nullified in such a baffling way. The varied map and scenarios are a good idea, but all play out the same. Rulebook is also a mess when trying to look up basic rules (so many pages for what could be explained in about 4).

The best part, as the publishers name suggests, are the cool miniatures. Sadly this is also the part that hooks people into buying this lemon.

Backed the Kickstarter at the Blitkreig level, and bought every damned add-on. These guys look like weebles, but the playful artwork and style really appealed to me.

Plus, I'm a big Steampunk fan, and I'm starting to shy away from miniatures games. Although I still enjoy miniatures, I just prefer them in a complete board game. And this one seemed to fit perfectly.

After a few plays, and realizing that you need a giant box to hold everything (as you need ALL your shit to play), I found the lackluster game play couldn't be obscured by pretty miniatures. So, I sold it all for a loss.

The days of unloading Kickstarters for profit seems to be gone....either that, or Rivet Wars fell way short of expectations. I'd say it's the latter, and not the former.

Expected delivery: Sept. 2013

I may raise this rating whence the add-on stuff gets to me, but until then it is surprising/maddeningly 'Meh'.

I feel I wasted money on this game and that almost never happens for me.

If the add-on's are what make this game a good time then I think the core box is seriously overpriced/lacking in models. I am thinking its the lack of model.

First two Scenarios played today, was not very optimistic going into this game but was very pleasantly surprised, me being originally a wargamer I thought this would be maybe too basic and after playing Dust Tactics and not loving that game as I had hoped lead me to my pessimism.


Oh how I was wrong, very good game, love the miniatures, love the rounds and the reinforcing per turn, love the simplicity yet a lot of special abilities and different troops keep it fresh, gives me a similar feel to Battle lore Second edition.



Played another scenario today but as the Blight, the allies seem way over powered, infantry move faster and have better range. Also the allies can get the artillery out which has the best range in the game... very worried now.

I kickstarted this game with all of the bells and whistles. I played it a few times with just the core box before all of the extras arrived. Unfortunately, it was too simple and was over before I could get any of my cool units on the board. 

While the extra content (and there is a lot) would likely make this game better, I could never muster the gumption to get everything out to play. It should not take 150 minis to play a good version of a game, especially when I would likely not get more than 5-10 of them out before someone won.

In short, too much hassle, not enough depth. I would pass unless the game was already set up and ready to play when I arrived at a game night.

Meh. Miniatures are cool, but gameplay is somewhat lacking. Every game we played, one player is pulling ahead by turn 3 and there is no good way to get back when you are losing. You can usually quit when someone pulled ahead, no reason to play it out.

Rivet Wars is a miniatures boardgame that springs forth from the warped imagination of Ted Terranova - set on a world that never quite left World War I but with crazy technology like walking tanks, diesel powered armor, unicycled vehicles and armor plated cavalry!

Don't let the cute visuals fool you, it's a world full of angst, war-torn camaraderie and dark humor.

Rivet Wars is at its heart a strategy game, with both players deploying units each round to counter the threats set forth by their opponent and stay one tactical step ahead.

A fast, fun, mildly tactical minis game with gorgeous chibi miniatures. The main problems are a lack of variety in the core box and unbalanced mission cards - Nexus Ops does it better for cheaper and any number of better games can be bought for the insanely high RRP.

A very interesting game where you always have to counter your opponent's moves by recruiting and using the right units. I don't recommend to buy this game if you don't plan to get at least one expansion since without them the game gets boring and samey really fast. But it's simply awesome with at least one expansion! And if you own the Kickstarter version then this game's replayability will never end since there are tons and tons of units. And if even that gets boring, the game is designed in such a way that you can create your own variants very easily. From a fast skirmish game to a tower defence or a long battle, this game has a lot of variety. The only downside is the luck factor which is sometimes present, namely that a player doesn't have any luck with his dice for a time. Other than that the game doesn't really have any flaws and is simply a joy to be playing.

Fun and accessible light combat game reminiscent of the Advance Wars video game. In my estimation, the entire strategic scope of the game is in service of the basic infantry units that are asymmetrically strong and weak against each other, but can not simply be ignored because they are required to control objectives. This play and counter-play makes unit purchases, unit positioning and target prioritisation interesting and meaningful.

*選定使用劇本牌列地形，每個人拿一邊的模型，分數標記放0，並拿對應的單位介紹卡或版圖，行動卡跟秘密任務卡根據劇情需求，如有使用則洗勻放置紀錄版，起始沒特別說時隨機

1.卡片 可棄一張行動卡，抽一張新的，上限三張(滿上限不能抽，首家第一輪不抽)，抽最多兩張秘密任務卡，上限2
2.部屬階段 根據劇本每回合有固定的部屬點數跟鉚釘值(紀錄到圖板)，花對應點數放單位到你的部屬區(劇本決定)，直到你花完或不想放，只有鉚釘值會存，英雄單位(旗幟中間有一條白的)只能上場一次，死掉移除，同時有兩種模式的不同時在場上
3.戰鬥階段 一次選一個大格，使用特殊能力或攻擊，攻擊是距離算大格，只能對角一次，且大格內不能有友方單位，並對準大格內對方的被攻擊順位(數字小的先)，根據守方的裝甲類型跟攻擊方的攻擊能力骰對應骰，只要有一顆5以上就造成一點傷害，有多種攻擊列每列都結算可不同目標
*攻擊如果需要結算偏移，則抽一張行動卡根據上面來偏離攻擊目標，可能會打到友方，卡片上的圖格子是大格

*隱藏任務卡 中間是完成條件，下方瞄準符號幾個幾分
*行動卡 中間時行動，下方為使用階段，最下方為攻擊偏移時使用

Fast, furious, action-packed and accessibly simple miniatures game with containable play area, no rulers, and amazing minis. Except for the minis, probably won't attract hardcore miniatures gamers. Randomness is keenly influential, but games are quick. Of course, tons of expansions will ramp up the fun and drain your wallet...

Great intro to miniature gaming. Battles can be quick and intense. Ability to choose and decide which units to deploy and when is a huge plus. This adds a whole different strategy to the game. The miniatures themselves are the main reason for me to get this game - they are beautifully designed and crafted.
Hope to see more scenarios being developed for this game.

Wasn't for me, I'm not sure why.  I think it may have been the mix of comic humor and war.  I enjoy war and strategy games on the computer, so maybe this just wasn't complicated enough for me, but in its defense, it wasn't supposed to be.

Simply amazing! An elegant design, beautiful minis, easy to learn rules and exciting seesaw battles.
As one gets fresh soldiers and tanks every turn it is very hard to cripple your opponent's force. Therefore your goal is always to get a certain amount of victory Points instead of wiping out the opposing army.

Move, attack/roll, try to complete objective.  Luck abounds.  Cute figures don't make up for limiting constraints on certain figures, like no wheeled vehicles in the trench or shooting into a trench if you're not adjacent or have a LOS into it.  Simple fun but not very deep.  Plays fast.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Asymmetric play between the two sides with cards to play for actions and secret missions means that after the learner scenarios, things get interesting. The miniatures are kind of Weebles meats WWI meets steamtech and there is some cute tongue in cheek stuff going on as well. It's a fun game and should get more interesting as more stuff gets added. It does need a FAQ, at this time, to answer a few questions. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A lot of luck, every attack involves rolling a d6 and hitting on a 5 or a 6. It plays fast though, and has great pieces. I have only played the into scenario, so we'll see how the game shapes up. Fairly light game - good tactical introductory game.

Ted: if you ever read this?
Consider taking this Licence over to SodaPop, won't you?

I've mentioned that I am a Miniatures-type guy, yes?
Once again: I pledged for the "full extended KS version"
with all the extra large maps, extra player tokens, and Big Ol' piles 'o' expansion boxes.
The gameplay was.... not memorable, but the minis were plentiful and amusing.
So... ... ... Worthwhile?

Also yet once again:
I would absolutely -hate- the retail version of this;
something that is a -solid- HallMark with CMON's products, it would seem...


Verdict: Extremely mitigated and narrow Success

Cyber punkish diesel powered miniatures in an alternate WWI war game. Very cool socketed minis. The infantry units are cute as hell. Minis look great and the card and terrain tile art is very nice. Action boards, rules, and card text are inviting and intuitively organized. Very simple actions and rules that would be great for the kids.

RATING: N/A
Only have two plays so I'm not rating it yet, there is way too much game to really get a handle on whats here (I guess that's solid praise in some ways). I love the locality setup and the advance/reserve piece with the feinted attacks to create an element of flanking. I think the setup can be sort of onerous and in particular, the decision making is mostly front loaded to that first part with what units to place where. The rules burden for attacking in particular are difficult to remember, and in that regard, I'm not sure how much I'd get to play it as teaching this (and having it taught to me) was a real bear. I think after two plays, if someone asked my gut reaction, I'd be inclined to say it's a solid game, *incredibly* unique, but I wouldn't pay anywhere close to the current OOP price for it (I got mine in a trade fwiw).

one can see and appreciate much work/consideration/playtesting behind the game; very interesting/innovative (also abstract) game system; a bit prone to AP (depending on players) because of very dense rules (although it's just a few pages); lack of any hints/requirements concerning initial setup - not a good idea, at least in my opinion.
If you have a bit more time - long scenario highly recommended.

RATING: 4
Played today without bothering to read the rules. A Russian Guard infantry unit swept the French from the central villages, causing them to suffer the penalty of committing their Guard, this combo largely largely winning the battle for the allies. Its difficult not to see each other's units if they are pointing the wrong way, but then fog-of-war was rarely as thick as this. The secrecy it affords is what keeps the design afloat.

Everything would seem to depend on the 3s, and then the Guard 3s.

Surprisingly pure artillery played a very limited role.  

Highly abstract. The predictability will evoke inaction most of the time, and it is very simplistic. The game is about grand tactics, and thats all that will drive repeat play value.

I finally got to play this game at Origins 2008 and loved it... Many thanks to ChemEng for teaching me the ropes, I would not have had a such a great Origins without your help.  

The game movement could be subtle or bold, and the combat when engaged was bloody for all involved as I imaginged it was.  Anyone who appreciates a thoughtful wargame would enjoy this one.

A wargmaing experiencing unlike any other. You move, attack, and defend, but the mechanics are so far afield from any other game—wargame, block, or otherwise—it feels like you’re learning something completely new. The rules aren’t difficult, but the learning curve is steep. Use the player-made aids, struggle through two or three games internalizing the mechanics, and the rewards are great. Every move seems like it’s the one that could lose you the game, and often that’s true. When you’re done with a game, it’ll feel like you’ve run a 10k while taking the SATs. And from a purely visual standpoint, you won’t find a more beautiful game. The words “elegant” and “groundbreaking” are often tossed around; with NT, they absolutely fit.

I have a lot of respect for this game but I'm not sure how much I [i]like[/i] it yet.

Update: It turns out I like it quite a bit but I can never remember the rules well enough to feel like I'm really engaging fully. The rulebook is written in a very unhelpful style. I occasionally have the quite uncharitable thought that Simmons wrote the rules to be brief rather than clear just to prove that a wargame can have a short rulebook. The game feels like the output of an auteur which is both good and bad.

Rachel Simmons is a great designer. There are those who hear that and get all "nah, he can't be [b]that[/b] good." Well he isn't.

He. Is. Better.

So much of the pointless garbage work of a traditional hex-based wargame is done here for you, that you can concentrate on what matters in the game. And the combat system, diceless as it is, is quite a bit more tense than any 3:2 odds attack you can roll dice for.

Bowen is an artist. With one or two exceptions, everybody else is just one more Bangladeshi laborer producing cheap sweaters for Walmart in a sweatshop.

RATING: 7
Bonaparte at Marengo (BaM) was the shock of the new, a really fresh design. Napoleon's Triumph refines its mechanics, gives you a much larger board to manouevre on, more strategic options and a fluid situation in which the momentum will likely shift, as in the real battle of Austerlitz.

The rules have come in for criticism.  They all seem to be there, it's just that it's really hard to get your head around their implications for play. In particular, combat is quite complex, with lots of exceptions.  Save yourself some headaches by downloading Gerry Haggerty's one-page attack summary.  For some reason the deterministic combat in Triumph bothers me in a way it didn't in the smaller scale, more puzzle-like BaM.  While it simulates multi-turn attritional fighting very well, it feels oddly undramatic.

Production quality is truly excellent, with a better job done of making symbols and borders visible.  The game looks beautiful when set up.

RATING: 4.5
Gorgeous map and I really like the way corps are moved and units placed into position. It catches Napoleonic warfare well. I have doubts about the use of the cavalry.

The rules on the contrary are not written in a user friendly way, but more in a juridicial way. It sometimes drives me crazy.

I also wonder whether 2nd December is not too short. The number of game turns is quite limited. Clearly a game that is designed to play in under 3 hours. For me that is not a pro, since I like long games. The market clearly thinks different about that! But you'll have to practice a couple of games before you are able to play this game under 3 hours.

The 1-2-3 unit per stick is a bit too flat to my wargaming taste. No historical unit identification.

My strategic advice for me as Austrian in my next game will be: wait a couple of turns and attack then. If the French brings in his reinforcements, he won't have enough time to reach his objectives: the three different stars. And if he doesn't I believe the Austrian will be able to win the day by just pressing on. Just a theory but if it works I regard that as a game design flaw. Latest update: it didn't work! You can also lose by attritional warfare.

Flesh nor Fish! Mainly manoeuvreing which I do not object, but it does not feel like the battle of Austerlitz. Most of the time is spent with your nose in the rules. How can this game so highly rated? A mystery to me!

... the corps commanders are there, but where are the three emperors!?

RATING: 8
First game 2 vs 2 teams, which I enjoyed (even the limited communications with your ally, which I was dubious about.) The rulebook is very badly arranged, to my mind, which means there's too much time spent grappling with the rules. It takes a long time to even start figuring out how to do what you want. But great fun for all that, a wonderful "look", a very original take on Napoleonics which I am keen to play again.

I enjoy wargames but it’s a struggle to get them on the table. Hammer of the Scots has been my favourite wargame for a while now and that could change with this game. When I got Napoleon’s Triumph I got my only friend capable of learning the rules over for a game. I’d read the rules 4 or 5 times and thought I had a reasonable grasp of them to teach him. I was wrong. We ended up retiring from the game and he took the rules home to study. He came back the next day and we spent 4 hours going over them with a play test. I feel now we have about 85-90% of the rules down.  This is a provisional rating, I’m expecting it could go up once we can clearly ‘see’ the game and the rules are in the back ground.

A nice looking game that is also a tense challenge for both sides.  The attack rules involve a lot of steps, so I like to refer to the rulebook when going through attacks, but I am still a new player to the game.  I imagine after a few plays, I would not need to confirm things with the rulebook as much.  Bowen makes elegant games.  I started with Guns of Gettysburg and this one doesn't disappoint either.

RATING: 10
With a somewhat steep learning curve, this one seems to be one of the most elegant wargaming designs I have ever seen.

I don't know any other game in which clever maneuvering is so central to the dynamics as this one. And the rules governing manoeuvres seem very realistic considering Napoleonic combat engagements. 

The attack rules, as stated by pretty much everyone that has tried this game, are not intuitive and are very hard to grasp just by reading them. So I recommend playing the game with an experienced player. They are pretty easy if someone guides you through the options and procedures.

If you don't have an experienced opponent, then I recommend the next best thing: the series of videos posted by other users here. They are very useful.

After your first play, I recommend reading the compilation of design choices made by the designer. Simmons is nothing short of brilliant!

And the art is absolutely gorgeous. 

Fantastic game!

EDIT after 4 plays:  This game is just perfect.

Great production values with fabulous map and rectangle blocks that evoke period maps.

Gameplay has a good, historical feel to it. Command and control is a problem as formations become engaged, there is a palpable sense of marching and deploying as units maneuver. There is a real sense of fixing forces in place before punching a hole or caving in a flank, which elicits a local collapse amongst neighbouring units.

In other words it feels like a Napoleonic battle, unlike most traditional games.

However, I have to knock a point or two off for a stupendously unclear and wordy rulebook that feels like its written in some form of legalise. I'm still not sure I entirely understand the attack procedure.

One of the most elegant looking games I have ever come across with one of the ugliest set of rules. Far too much like hard work trying to get my head around this. Simply do not understand whole sections of the tediously drawn-out combat process. 
This is one of those games where you spend five minutes playing, then another ten searching through the rules to try to find the answer to a question. Part of the reason for that is that there's so much that offends against not just history, but common sense. For example, cavalry move at the same speed as infantry. Yes, really. Guard infantry are better than line infantry when they attack, but no better when defending. Your artillery can be pounded by an attacker but cannot fire a shot in reply.
Alarm bells should have started ringing when I read that this game has no dice. So combat is decided by hidden movement followed by revealing your attacking pieces (well, maybe, some of them, which ones depends on all sorts of tedious stuff that make this so wearisome, like the section telling you what restrictions apply to your choice of attacking units doesn't include all the restrictions, some are elsewhere - good luck trying to find them). In this sense it is no different to Stratego, with the rider that the rules of Stratego are comprehensible and the game rather entertaining in its limited way. This hidden movement produces its own absurdities - for instance, you have no idea what troops you are facing even though they are a short distance away across an open field. 
To rub salt in the wound, the designer in his notes clearly considers himself something of a genius (calling himself a "craftsman" and telling us what "particularly pleases" him about the game). Meanwhile I'm banging my head on the table til it bleeds. I could have done without the triumphalist notes and would have preferred an index instead, to help my way around a most impenetrable and joyless set of rules.
If things were reversed and this was the first wargame invented, and then someone else came up with the idea of using dice, hexes, and counters marked with unit strengths and speed, then it is the latter who would be considered the craftsman, and this game would be considered an evolutionary deadend.
The designer also said that he was driven by the attraction of designing a game that was simple, large and fast-playing - "attributes that I didn't think had ever been successfully combined in a wargame".
Simple? That's one thing this game is never in any danger of being accused of. It's for a good reason that one of the threads on this website is called "Why questions are often asked about Napoleon's Triumph", and some kind souls have entirely re-written the rules and posted the results online.

Elég egyedi wargame. Az első partiban csak a felszínt kapirgáltuk, szerintem 4-5 parti kéne, hogy egy kicsit mélyebben átlássam. Jó ötletek vannak benne, pl. az nagyon tetszik, hogy a franciák a taktikájukkal befolyásolhatják a győzelmi feltételeket, és a helyszínek felosztása is teljesen újszerű (tartalék + összeköttetések). A morál változás is jó!
Játékélményben nem adott elsőre annyit, mint amennyi időt elvett, ennek ellenére látok benne fantáziát. A 9 oldalas szabályhoz képest nem könnyű. A hossza nem vészes, hacsak nem megy végig a játék, de nehezen tudom elképzelni, hogy addig kitartson a morál.
---
Ami még eszembe jutott: tetszik, ha egy játékot kevés kellékkel oldanak meg, főleg egy ilyen bonyolultságút. Gyakorlatilag egy jó nagy táblán és az egységeken kívül semmi más kellék nincs. Se kocka, se kártya, semmi szerencsefaktor... 
---
2 év elteltével került elő megint: nos, ez egy nagyon különleges játék, de valamiért nem fogott meg. Nem nagyon tudom befogadni a mechanikáját, nem is éreztem rá emiatt az egészre. Nem érzem elég letisztultnak a szabályt. Biztos történelem hűre akarták csinálni, de nekem kicsit erőltetett lett, és néha nem is világos minden. Pedig egyébként nagyon szép a tábla, és különleges az is hogy 1 (2) napot ölel fel. Újra kiemelem, hogy 0 szerencsefaktor... Egyszerűen ravasznak kell lenni. De először is át kéne látni a szabályt.

I'm a big fan of games with a lot of historical events and a strong narrative, so I was initially somewhat skeptical if this rather game would be just be a touch too abstract and elegant for me. After three playings I find that NT creates a truly compelling narrative and by putting you in the mindset of a Napoleonic-era general makes for an absolutely immersive experience. 

Easily the best game in my collection.

RATING: 8
Rating based on the first two plays. 

This is a meaty, no luck, strategical and tactical chess-like game that has an epic and historical feel in a short period of time. There are elements of maneuvering, fog of war and bluffing where clever play will dictate the outcome. 

I am still at the infancy stage with this one, but I could already see the potential it has despite my difficulties in comprehending the attack rules. Hopefully, my perserverance will pay off to counter it's 
inaccessibility and finally enjoy this gem to it's fullest . A big thanks to Mr. John Brier for teaching me the game and for putting up with a neophyte's mistakes.

The game takes us back to the battle of Austerlitz and does a great job of simulating the battle, the battlefield and the period. I was not particularly interested in this event or the time period, but because of NP, I am looking forward to reading and discovering this part of history.

RATING: 10
Every game I publish is as good as I can make it at the time I publish it, and so, for me, they all deserve a 10.

But that doesn't mean I can't analyze what does and doesn't work.

As something that doesn't work: The attack sequence rules in NT leave much to be desired. All of the information is there, but the presentation interweaves rules for multiple, quite different forms of attack (bombardment, feint, assault, "maneuver" attack) into a single sequence, which makes it hard to parse out how any single form of attack works. Also, a LITTLE redundancy for reference purposes wouldn't have hurt. I didn't have to be such a purist about it.

As to what does work: pretty much everything else.

Even after almost 10 years, I think NT is damn near perfect in terms of what I wanted to do in terms of how it looks and plays.

It has the size of a monster game, but can be played in a single setting. The incorporation of the metal flags is an extremely pleasing addition to the 19th century battle map visual design inherited from Bonaparte at Marengo. As a result, I honestly don't think any other historical board war game has the visual impact of NT.

The corps rules, in addition of poker elements added to the Bonaparte at Marengo design base, and the way the victory conditions work really do give the game a nice Austerlitz quiddity. Deception, bluffing, laying traps are all a huge part of game play. That, combined with pretty good game balance, makes for really tense, exciting game play that is different every time you play.

If I had it to do over again, I'd re-organize the attack rules, refresh the map art (new sources have since become available and I've improved my graphic art techniques since then) but otherwise, I can't think of much of anything I would do different. I think NT is something I can really be proud of. And am.

RATING: 6
Like the Marengo game and despite the changes, I still cannot wrap my head around the combat system or the new "feint" attack. Still, the same high production standards and ground-breaking style of play hold up as models for others. UPDATE: the best approach is to take your time in moving against your opponent. You need to find out as much as you can about the disposition of your opponent's army before committing to an attack. Unless your enemy discerns a weakness in your deployment and hits it with overwhelming force, a probing attack--or even a serious one--invariably works out to the defender's favor.

Only downside is, that it is often hard to grasp for new players, it only shines with equally experienced players.

Incredible game.

This is such a delicate wargame.  I don't know how to explain it but it probably takes playing it a couple times to grasp in that the game is all about how you align forces due to meet and how you try to punch hows in the lines.

My perception of this is that: approaches matter a whole heck of a lot and also you want to design how to get some advantage on how enemies apprach you and when.

Wow!  Chess meets wargames!  There's hidden information (troop type and strength) but no randomness.  Players set up their initial corps secretly so the other player knows how many blocks you have where but no idea of their relative strengths.  Wow!  

Other than that, it's a relatively simple game.  Three different types of units.  Terrain modifiers for battle on the map.  Movement is virtually the same.  There's a difference if your unit is part of a corps or alone and re-attaching is difficult).  

I really like it.  Once you get your head around the game, it's not tough mechanically, but that initial learning curve to get it takes a while.  And then, once you know the mechanics... I have no idea how long it takes to figure out even basic strategies.  Tactics are pretty straightforward, but strategies?  Give me a year or two.

Super nice components and an amazing huge map that works very nice.  The game itself takes time to get the hang of but it soooo is worth the effort!

RATING: 7.5
Wargame de recreación histórica de la batalla de Austerlitz, en la que Napoleón se enfrentó a las tropas Austrorusas. Muy cuidado el diseño. Los cuerpos de ejércitos se pueden dividir en unidades independientes. Es un juego más táctico que estratégico. Azar cero y sin dados. Tiene gran importancia aprender el manejo de demarcaciones y lindes. Sistema de batalla que simula muy bien las confrontaciones de la epoca. Se juega por la consecución de determinadas posiciones marcadas en el mapa (que de producirse implica haber roto el frente del derrotado).

La caja del juego ya puede decir misa, es un juego para dos jugadores. 

Conocido de la mano de kintaro, en abril de 2010.

Rating on the rules, discussion on BGG.
Also played singleplayer once to learn the rules better.

It´s a fine game and it will be a very anticipated game when this hits the table.

Played it once with newbie players.
Was a lot of rule questions going around, making the gaming experience a bit low.
But i still think that the games shine a lot. A very good way to use the hidden knowledge with the full knowledge what you can see.

Think the game need an experienced player that teach the game for first time players to get the rules to be easy to learn.

Hunh.  Rating based on two plays (both fairly quick losses).  I can honestly say that I'm not sure quite what happened in either game.  I found it much less intuitive than Bonaparte at Marengo or pretty much any other game I've ever played.  I need to read through the forum posts and other resources, poke at the pieces, and figure out what is going on before attempting this bad boy again.

A great wargame that is based solely on each players skill, there is no luck here.  Much like Chess, the player who can better look ahead and visualize where the battle is going, will likely be the player who can maneuver and win the battle.  Somewhat complex with a steep learning curve, the rewards are immense once you "get it".

No doubt objectively a great game and recreation of the period. Brutal, painful, exhausting, punishing and intense. Not that complicated, but a huge learning curve nonetheless in terms of skill and tactical mastery - you will be crushed by any experienced player while you try to fathom out how to play. Not for the feint hearted or casual gamers.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Intriguing and deceptively "realistic". A must for any Napoleonic Wars enthusiast. It is the only game where I was left with a strong impression of the battlefield tactic of force commitment to draw your foe's reserves which in turn sets up the later decisive punch. It is well worth persevering to get over the learning hump as you will be rewarded with a rich gaming experience. Plays relatively quickly too.

PROS: Once you get the hang of the mechanics, it flows very nicely. Small (but somewhat challenging) rulebook. Simulates the feel of a Napoleonic battlefield unlike any game I know. Quick playing. Beautiful to look at if that matters to you. Tense, difficult decisions throughout; probably more so than any other game in my experience with "Twilight Struggle" as a possible exception. Unique. An extremely rewarding wargaming experience.

CONS: Huh? Well, the mechanics can be a challenge at first, but just sit down, maneuver some units through example combats and you will get "it". It makes me feel dirty just using the word "con" with this game...

Gift for Christmas 2017.  
This feels too much like chess.  Life (and war) are full of random events, incredible feats against the odds and this game has none of that.   I honestly felt bored as I played through the game.  Now, I appreciate the interesting design but when I finished my play I just thought to myself, "I just played chess on a wargame board." and it I want to play chess, well, I'll play...chess.  So I give this game the same rating I give chess.

UPDATE: OK, time to clean up the comment again ...

I like Napoleon's Triumph a lot. I think it's a much superior game to its predecessor, Bonaparte at Marengo. The battlefield is wide and there is a lot of maneuver and plenty of different ways for the battle to evolve. The limited intelligence of the blocks really bites here; unlike BaM, there is real uncertainty about how strong the enemy is, and where. Sometimes you've done all the maneuver you can and you just have to go all in and throw everyone into the attack and see where the chips fall, and that's great.

The graphical effect of the blocks and flags is tremendous too, with great, high-quality components throughout.

Unfortunately, this is still going to be a bit of a niche product. The rules for attacks and movement, while evocative, are also opaque, very hard to grasp intuitively, and simply have to be experienced. Small mistakes can be punished rather severely. Definitely part game, part puzzle. Even now, 5 games in, I find I am just now starting to understand the importance of feints, and still can't cleanly grasp the ins and outs of the combat sequence. All the processes are tough to master here. I love where the game goes in the end, I just sometimes wish it could take a more direct route to get there.

Anyway. For me, this is a wonderfully fascinating game, which I have always enjoyed and look forward to many more playings of. Bonaparte at Marengo didn't totally sell me, but Napoleon's Triumph did; I think it represents a much more sophisticated and polished game than Bonaparte and Marengo, and has me hankering Guns of Gettysburg. But accessible, it's not.

RATING: 9
A brilliant game, with tense, difficult decisions at every step.  There is an intricate interplay between time, the geography of the board, and the victory conditions.  The different units "feel" distinctive - with sweeping cavalry, plodding infantry, and vulnerable but potentially devastating artillery.  But it's all brought together by the thick fog of war provided by the blocks, which adds a crucial element of bluff and daring.  

It works well as a team game, too. 

It has to be said, though, that this is hard one to digest.  Despite only 12 pages or so of rules, it took me longer to really understand this game than any other game I've played (including monsters like Virgin Queen).

RATING: 9.9
After several plays, I now consider this at least as good a game as BaM and in many ways better.  The replay value is tremendous.  Games often go down to the wire and have a surprise ending.  It's a deep and resilient system.  It simulates the critical "must think ahead" nature of generalship in this era brilliantly, without complicated rules.  The game is not for everyone though, it does have a fairly tough learning curve.

Taking .1 point off the rating because only today, after 5 years of owning the game, do I actually understand the full issues surrounding cavalry corps attacks by road.  There is room for improvement in NT, and this is where most of that lies.

One game so far: dreadful experience. This is one for the puzzle fanciers. It may improve with an investment of time and repeated play, but it is unlikely to get either.

RATING: 9
To my mind BONAPARTE AT MARENGO showed the immense potential of this exceedingly innovative and clever game system, yet fell rather flat as an individual scenario since it plays as a methodical French delaying action and omits the historical turning-point and counterattack. Perhaps more puzzle than game, it doesn't surprise that BAM lends itself well to solitaire play.

Despite those conflicted feelings regarding the first entry into this game series, I was confident NT would live up to the system's immense potential. NT is to BAM what HANNIBAL's to WE THE PEOPLE. The mature masterpiece following-up a pioneering albeit somewhat flawed work.

Bowen Simmons delivers on his stated design mantra "More poker, less chess" by adding further nuances to combat resolution, emphasising Command & Control/Unit Cohesion and fashioning the victory conditions so as to make Austerlitz the true gamble it happened to be for both sides. Ample room for manoeuvre also allows the system to shine.

Bowen Simmons offers us a most admirable design achievement. Indeed, he's possibly the most gifted and innovative designer in today's wargame hobby. 

That being said, the game clearly isn't for everyone (more so than many other wargames). Some may be discouraged by the learning-curve, others might miss their chrome, the luck factor or simply find it too much of a brain-burner. 

I certainly have way to go on that learning-curve, though for me it's piece and parcel of the enjoyment. Bowen Simmons's system has managed to make me - very much a grand-strategy scale wargamer - once again interested in tactical wargames. It finally nails the battlefield experience I've always been looking for.

My admiration for this design couldn't be higher (i.e. a 10). Yet NT isn't the sort of game I personally could play an infinite number of times. So I'll go for a tentative overall rating of 9.

RATING: 10
I'm one of those that enjoyed BaM but felt it was a little dry and "scripted" in terms of how the battle played out. Neither is true with Napoleon's Triumph, which obsoletes BaM in my opinion. Although it's quite thematic, it's light on narrative compared to more chrome laden games but I wouldn't trade elegance for chrome in this case. It's also eminently replayable despite only covering a single battle.

The only downside is the rulebook which, although complete, is written in such a way that my group had a hard time absorbing the rules (and this from guys who play OCS). The rules read like a good math proof: exquisite in their succinctness and completeness but unfortunately just as opaque without some concentration. The examples helped but it still took a couple of plays to get them right. That being said, the rulebook makes an ideal reference for those players who already know the rules and their implications.

UPDATE: Upgrading to 10. This game just pulls you deeper and deeper every time you play it. It's chess, poker, and a wargame all rolled into one. Barring classic abstracts, NT is probably the deepest game I own that can be played in an evening. It's much deeper than virtually all Euros. I'd like to see more Euro players give NT a chance, as I think those that tend toward the heavier games would enjoy NT.

RATING: 9
Quite a work of art, this one.  It may be the greatest game in the history of mankind...we'll have to see how it holds up to repeated play.  Great use of blocks--the fog of war is intense.  I'll take my wargame with chess and poker por favor. 

Minor complaints:  The rulebook is not great.  It needs more examples, better organization, and some practical advice on play.  Also, it is a very hard game to explain and nowhere near newbie-friendly.

Very much a game rather than a historical sim(though it does have a historical feel and I get the sense of being a Napoleonic leader without excessive chrome). If you study the map and the battle, you'll pick up on how much research went into this sucker.  The brilliance is that you needn't do that; you could ignore the history side and just play, totally unaware of the real-life simulation unfolding before your eyes. CAUTION: This is not the type of game where you read the rules, play a couple times and then move on.  It requires repeated play to yield it's brilliance; you're doing it and yourself a disservice by not giving it your full attention.  Odd and cumbersome at first, but once the rules fade into the background, you see how elegant it really is.   It is fairly calculation-heavy, but it shouldn't have the A.P. of Chess or Go because of the hidden info.  Sometimes you just have to cast your fate to the wind and hope for the best.

Pretty much everyone should try this game.  It's way out-there-Beethoven- Picasso-Hitchcock brilliant.  Quit reading about it and buy it before it's sold out.

UPDATE:  After second PBEM game(so grain of salt) I found the game brilliant but maybe overly calculative.  You really have to be in the mood for an intellectual exercise.  It's slightly lacking in the "fun" department so I won't give it the full bump to 10 but I may update that if I ever get a face to face game in.

Certainly appears to be a more historical game than BaM, and therefore more to my taste. As visually appealing as its predecessor, and appears to be less programmed in play. This is a tough one. Play doesn't feel fun; it's hard work and all too easy to make crucial mistakes in understanding the implications of the rules. I understand the designer's desire to let people learn the game for themselves, but I would really have appreciated some guidance for my first games. At the end of a game I'd like to play again, but to give it a few months to recover from the experience!

Basically an abstract game with a pasted on theme. Cavalry are not faster than infantry.  You can't see who you are fighting right across the field, to the point where you have no idea if they are cavalry, infantry or artillery.  Artillery can't return fire. Your strongest attack will automatically be defeated by a pair of weak defenders.  The attacker doesn't have to say who he is assaulting with until after the defenders are revealed - he can suddenly change from an infantry assault to an artillery barrage after the defenders have deployed to meet the assault.  If some of your men march, others can't, for no apparent reason, unless you split them off as independents, and then suddenly they can. I couldn't find one thing to like about the rules, or the map (ugly colors, hard to see area borders and obstacle notations).  Pieces were ok, although the lack of unit IDs made it all a very generic depiction of a very un-generic era.  Soulless and chess-like.

For people who love abstract games only.

Napoleon's Triumph is not only a great wargame, but a great game - one that I immediately placed an order for and have continued to think about and yearn to play. That battle resolution is deterministic is certainly a plus for me given my personal preference for low/no-luck games, but what wins me over so completely is the intensely evocative nature of the ruleset as a whole. The way the rules bring strategic and tactical considerations of the era alive is frankly a thing of beauty. The emphasis on maneuver, the inevitabilty of losses, the subtle but dramatic differences between unit types and their respective strengths and liabilities… It is all just a joy. And it is wrapped up in the most beautiful package imaginable. This game in play is far and away the most aesthetically pleasing vision in my collection. My only concern is that it has ruined me for all other wargames. Luckily Guns of Gettysburg should be coming out soon.

RATING: 9
Since this game is so unique it's a bit tough to get your head around the combat rules. I think that Bowen, in his effort to keep the rules down to 10 pages, streamlined his descriptions a bit too much. His rules and prose are tremendously terse and concise, but in this case I think it's a disadvantage. While incorporating attacks into movement may allow a page of rules to be cut, I don't think it's a good idea from the standpoint of learning the game.

That said, in terms of the game play itself, I really liked it very much. The maneuver element is great - I once described the maneuver in Friedrich as 'pure' and that's the same way I feel about this game. When one of your corps is flanked, the tension is definitely there.

The components speak for themselves - they are among the best in the industry.

RATING: 8.4
This is a lighter wargame with a no-chance combat system... either you win or lose.  It reenacts the Battle of Austerlitz, when Napoleon defeated superior numbers to crush the allied Austrian and Russian army.  This game plays like Kriegspiel and comes with an awesome no-punches-pulled layout.  A REAL board, great playing pieces, simple rules.  The system is elegant, even if it doesn't quite capture a realistic feeling.  I think this is an awesome game with an elegant design.  Introduce this game to new wargamers interested in Musket and Ball wargames.  The look of the game alone will draw them in.

UPDATE 11/29/2010: This is a game that is probably not for new gamers.  After 6 plays, the game is VERY nuanced and while the rules are simple, the way the rules interact make the game a brain-burner.  I still really like this game (more and more each time I play it), but it requires several plays before you can "get it".  Until then, it will frustrate a new-comer.  The best way to learn this game is to let two newbs play each other with a rules explainer and advice guy moderating the game.

UPDATE 09/28/2013: Three years on, this game still continues to deliver.  At BGG Con 2011, my play of this game was one of my best gaming experiences ever.  While blowing my chances early in the game, the French team decided to counter-attack.  I dug in along the Prazenberg Heights and over the course of the next several hours, the French probed the Austrian line, being rebuffed at each turn.  The game came down to the last turn.  After several French attacks, and only one order left to give, the French made a desperate attack to demoralize the allies.  The game was tense because I had many weak portions of my line, but the French team did not chose to attack those locales.  Allied win by the skin of our teeth.

Once you get a group of players who really know how to play this game and understand the nuances, the game becomes a really great give and take - the design is coherent, with all the unnecessary fat trimmed, but uses innovative combat sequencing to simulate Napoleonic combat.  Upgrading my rating on this one.

This is a beautiful game. The physical presence is simply impressive. This has to be the most asthetically pleasing game I own.

The design is just as impressive as the components would suggest. There is a lot of elegance....and a lot of departure from Bonaparte at Marengo (more than I initially expected). After playing NT several times, I doubt I have a need to revisit BaM (which is clearly earlier on the family tree and ultimately the inferior game).

For example, the winning condition create a situation that motivates the Allied player to attack (to strive to control a blue star space).  The French player than feels pressure to bring on his reinforcements. If that occurs, the winning conditions change subtly in word and drastically in impetus, but in a way that puts the Allies on the defense. Thus, you potentially produce a sweeping change in the initiative on the battle-field with a very simple choice/rule. This creates a palpable game tension, and is very elegant in my opinion.

I've played this game enough to realize that to play well requires a fair bit of study and thought. I butchered my advance on the first game. 

Yet despite the need for repeat playings to master some of the strategic rudiments, there is a background of bluff and calling of bluffs.  There is some poker here, no matter how strong the position is.  I look forward to playing this one many times.

This game also lends itself very well to PBEM play. I enjoy it both face to face and by email. I have not been able to try the team rules yet, although they also look promising.

Bowen Simmons goes from strength to strength with this system. Superb production values and a superbly beautiful game on the table. The rulebook is not imo very intuitive for those not familiar with this system - basic gameplay is actually much simpler than it appears from reading. Play goes quickly and the strategy involved belies the simplicity of the system. Make no mistake this is a complex and involving look at Napoleonic strategy with many opportunities for nail biting moments on both sides, though some grognards may be put off by the broad sweep presented here and the lack of "chrome". However, if you can open yourself to this diceless system there is much to please even old campaigners like myself. Once again Bowen provides spare parts to replace lost/damaged pieces - something other companies should take note of. This game takes the basics of the previous one (Bonaparte at Marengo) and improves it on every level. I highly anticipate the next title in this innovative and absorbing series. The game itself easily rates a "10", but I've taken .5 off overall for the slightly confusing (for non wargamers or new players to the system) rulebook. However, don't be put off - the rules are all there and nicely presented in colour. My recommendation - get this game!!

Concise rules, fog-of-war block mechanic, limited time, and multiple victory conditions make this game a gem.  I had to play it a number of times before the rules became intuitive - and I still have trouble determining if my attacks or defenses are successful or not.  But now that I know how to play, the game increased in enjoyment for me.  I strongly recommend that any serious strategy gamer give Napoleon's Triumph a go - you won't be sorry.

The combination of hidden units and maneuverability works well in this game.  I imagine it works even better with multiple commanders on each side.  NT is a beautifully-made, elegant design.  My misgivings are about the "series" of games by Mr. Simmons.  After reading about the differences for Guns of Gettysburg, the trend of substantially different systems for each iteration looks to be continuing.

I don't know, but I played this two times now and the rules are too unintuitive and fiddly for me. Corps get crushed to easily. Maybe I need more games, maybe with just two players. Marengo is much better and more tense. Components allow for a +1 one the rating, so might be a six in the future.

A masterpiece. There are really no other words to describe that can adequately describe this perfect, brilliant, pinnacle of a game.

Managed to find two copies locally ... one still in shrink (https://boardgamegeek.com/article/18186719#18186719) and the second opened but unplayed, and both pretty good deals. My copy is already picked up and on the table, and a copy for a friend and regular gaming buddy up the street to be picked up at TABSCON in March. Thanks very much to the sellers. 

My grail game. So excited!!!!!

What a masterpiece.  No dice - just skill, timing, and the luck that comes from a limited intelligence block-system.  This game builds on the legacy of Marengo but with new assault rules and variable victory conditions, as well as more options on the map, it means it really never plays the same twice.  The battles are huge and the tension before committing is fantastic.  The command and control system means that the game shifts sweetly from tactical to strategic and back again very smoothly.  Rules are not too tough, but the options they allow are not intuitive meaning the more I play it, the less likely I can introduce anyone to it as with any experience you will just smoke your opponent.

A truly intense, thoughtful game where bluffing, tactics, and strategy all combine into a rewarding game experience.  

But the rulebook is abysmal.  It explains everything in a manner that's so willfully indifferent to readability that it took me 10 read-throughs just to have a basic handle on the game.  Seriously, it's that bad.

A friend and I rewrote the rules so they make sense, and using them made my second and third plays helped a lot.

Yet to play it. I look at it weekly hoping to get it on the table. The closest I got was one abortive attempt with my wife, but my inability to explain the rules in a short blurb form before the game was a major stumbling block. That and the fact that the game was "a bunch of boring blocks on a boring map", beauty is truly in the eye of the beholder.

Best production values of any wargame I've ever seen. Only criticism I would have is that the boards are too heavy and are uncoated. Yeah, I wish they had been done on coated and lighter stock but that's me. Still and all, whoever packed it understood that putting flysheets between the boards was necessary to keep the ink from rubbing off in the box. BUT the boards are also so heavy that transporting the game will definitely result in box damage. Had I been the production editor I would have opted for a strong GMT-like box with lighter cardstock map. I can't figure out how this game didn't cost $100 given the production values. Just awesome.

It feels more like you're playing chess than commanding divisions. Because of the dice less system there are too many small exceptions in the rules, which are hard to remember when you only play it once in a while (due to length and theme), especially since several of them are quite unintuitive. All together a very unelegant system. In addition it takes app. 4-5 hours to finish one game, which is way too long for this very dry game.

RATING: 9.5
An excellent followup to Bonaparte at Marengo.  The larger size and new command rules give the player an excellent sense of command problems in this period.  For those willing to put the effort into more than just a few games, they will find the strategic options plentiful; and while the subtlety and nuances required to execute those strategies well can be a bit demanding, the rewards are well worth the time spent.My one slight nit is that this is the type of game and rule-set that takes my brain quite awhile to wrap around.  But that is more of a personal failing than a fault of the game.Bowen has the knack of always making me wonder "What next, Bowen?  Hurry up!"

RATING: 9
Well produced and looks great. The system results in a 'realistic' feeling battlefield which prompts the opinion that this is a good sim. 

Yes, some of the detail had been abstracted by the designer but this is still very much a wargame. A level of chrome may be missing and there may be no dice, but nearly every move presents a host of complex/crucial decisions shrouded in uncertainty. The fog of war and the far from predictable response of your opponent provides the randomness - you can't escape from making a bad call by making a lucky roll in this game.

The rule book is not the best (although everything is there) but most of the difficulties we experienced on first play were answered by q's and responses already posted on BGG.

(Rating udged up a half notch after second full play)

RATING: 9.5
Easily the best new wargame released in ages, that much was clear even after our first game. The game features all the tension of limited intelligence, all the decision making of a deep game, and even a deep basis is historicity. And it does all this with fresh ideas, moderate rules overhead, and best of all a fairly short playing time. Highest recommendation! 
 
We have tried out the multi-player rules and these add even more wonderful uncertainty to the equation. For an even more tense and challenging experience, play by the recommended multiplayer rules and be strict! It gives one a sense of the challenge of not knowing if your allies understand your intentions on the battlefield. A great experience for all involved.

As if game wasn't incredible enough, this one has the best components in ages and puts outfits like GMT and Avalanche to shame and does so for a low low price.

Traded off. A little sad, because it is a very pretty game and it feels clever. But, i think its  a game you need a dedicated opponent for, to learn the ins and outs of the system. Its a harsh mistress and playing once a quarter just leads to confusion and annoyance. 

------------

3 plays down of this game now, and i'm starting to get it, but still rules errors abound. This game is really unforgiving of errors. If you set up your corps bad at the start, or position a corps in a reserve rather than an approach or vice versa you can quickly lose a whole Corps to what seemed a minor mistake. There is however plenty of depth here and its worth the effort. I'd only really recommend this game however to folks that will play it often. It doesn't work very well as a game you get off the shelf once every now and again.


====================

Only played once and got many rules wrong. It doesn't appear to be complicated, but it isn't clear or intuitive. This game really really needs some examples of play in the rule book.

Having said this, my one game was fun. There is some deep strategy and tactics on offer here. It has hidden information, which i'm a sucker for. You can do some Napoleonic tactics; hammer and anvil, pincer movement etc, which heads it above CnC as a Napoleonic war game for me.

A very well thought out system that has the downside of having little or no detail. The combat resolution is over wrought, hiding the strategoesque principles of the game system.

RATING: 9
When I saw Bonaparte at Marengo my first reaction was this system would be great fit for a Austerlitz.

I was surprized at and pleased with the result.  There is a distinct time for maneuver and, once your opponent has been disjointed on the battlefield by maneuvering in the face of an enemy, and/or dissapated within his locale by feints, a time to drive home the attack.  I am reluctant to contemplate how artless, brute force would work for the attacker.  I will have to wait until some future game when a very daring opponent gives that option a try.

The game gives both players varied strategic options, but even more impressive is how even minor moves by your opponent create real threats and temptations that require a response from you.

One other point: I am famously non-visual, but this is an exceptionally beautiful and evocative game.

A truly nerve racking game where every move is a potential catastrophe. 

Edit: February 2011:  I don't normally give 10s, but I simply have to make an exception here. This is THE game! If I could only keep one wargame this would probably be it. Now that the rules are more or less clear I like this game more and more each time I play it. This is a really amazing game that takes a bit to learn, but the effort is definitely worth it.

The system is odd, but plays out in a very satisfying way. There's an amazing amount of play with only 3 basic unit types. Players are not throwing huge piles of units against huge piles of units (eg Risk). They are using position and maneuver to force their opponent to retreat and/or stretch their defenses too thin.

RATING: 10
A truly strategic game that puts you in the commander's seat. The player here decides almost everything about his battle plan: where the main effort and secondary attacks will be, the disposition of his army and how to execute his gameplan. For a set-piece battle, there's nothing more you can ask for. It is both fascinating and exciting to play by being a seriously challenging game - a real test of skill. This is what "conflict simulation" should be all about.

Best of all, it plays quickly and the rules are simple, although they're a bit hard to grasp at first, being so different from conventional wargames.

Some people have complained about the no-luck combat system but they're missing the point of randomising combat, which is not to make it random, but to create uncertainty. Well, NT certainly has uncertainty, as anyone who has blundered a Guard attack into three-strength defending units will know!

After a second play, I'm really hooked.  I love the probing and counter-probing, I love the combination of determinism and uncertainty, and I love the elegance of it all.  Also, it looks completely awesome.  

After a few more plays, this game has really grown on me.  I'm consistently amazed at the variety you can get from a single battle with a pre-set deployment.  I haven't even tried the 2-day scenario yet, and I still haven't seen anything even remotely similar.

Wow.  I really feel like one of those generals pushing little armies around with a stick when I play this game.  I just need a monocle now. I think back on the game after playing more than almost any other game.  It's just so utterly genius.  I just wish it were a little easier to teach people. Well, maybe teaching isn't the problem.  The difference between knowing the rules and knowing how to play is just so wide.  There's no substitute for experience.  This is not to steer anyone away from the game, but know that this is the kind of game where unless the opponent learns the game beforehand, and even then, you're just going to have to grind it out the first few games.

RATING: 10
NT is not a traditional wargame. There is no CRT, no dice, no hexes. Instead, there is locales with penalties directly implemented on the board. 

Your pieces are laid out alone or by corps along with a commander. On your turn, you move your pieces or corps from locale to locale. When the target locale is occupied by an ennemy, there is a combat :
1) attacker annonce his intention to move into the locale and attack
2) defender can retreat before combat or he must fight
3) attacker can feint or make a real attack
4) defender name the leading defenders (the guys who will suffer the charge and the losses first)
5) attacker name the leading attackers (the guys who will lead the charge and suffer the losses first)
6) initial result : leading attacker strength (1 to 3) - leading defenders strength (1 to 3) - terrain penalties
7) defender can almost always commit defending units to counterattack : counterattack units strength are substracted from the initial result
8) each side suffer losses
9) defeated side suffer morale losses

The game is won by demoralization of one side or territorial objectives (controlling locales with stars).

There is only 3 kind of units. They have strength and weakness :
- cavalry : extended range of manoeuvre to do scouting and screening. They are of reduce help into village/town/marsh.
- artillery : slow to engage on combat, they inflict damage without taking any losses. Used to do bombardment before assaulting with infantry. Weak if not defended by infantry or cavalry.
- infantry : the big mass of Napoleonic armies.

The game make us relive the battle of Austerlitz in an accurate fashion without to be scripted (due to special rules and victory conditions on reinforcement and territorial objectives), in a pretty short playing time and without too much chrome. For example, there is elite units (heavy cavalry and guard infantry). Players will have to think twice before commiting them because if defeated, the army will suffer additionnal losses. This was the case in Napoleonic wars : the elites was kept in reserve and only launched into the battle in desperate situations, like in Waterloo. Why ? because they were expensive and hard to replace. If defeated, the others regular units would have lost their courage and faith into victory.

About the Battle of Austerlitz : the French started weak on their right wing in order to bluff the Allied. The Allied attacked the French right wing from Pratzen Heights. The French held and waited for reinforcement on their right before launching an assault on Pratzen Heights with their center in order to cut the Allied army in two pieces. From that time, the battle was won. This is what Napoleon had planned the days before the battle. Hence the title of the game.

RATING: 9
Based upon one play as the French. "Poker" is right!!!! 

Attacking can be difficult with potential defender counterattacks but oh the payoff if you win and force a retreat!!! Tough the first time to figure out how one should allocate their forces to their commanders. For the French, two commanders begin off map and may enter as reinforcements (which however, makes it much easier for the Allies to win if time runs out) but how many and which units to allocate to them if they may never see the map board. But they can be quite a stinger if sufficient units are allocated and they try to roll up the Allied left if the Allies get too aggressive there.

While the combat rules seem to make logical sense, it's a bugger the first time playing. I still can't see much value in artillary (apropo for the battle).

If possible, feint, feint and feint about an opposing corp to draw units away from the corp and up to an approach and then smack 'em from a different approach. You should maintain your lines to prevent your opponent from attempting this. Great fun to have your calvary running behind the lines picking at lumbering corps (calvary may always retreat when in reserve without penalty).

RATING: N/A
Napoleon's Triumph is an odd beast. Comparatively light on rules as far as war games go, but the implications of all those squiggles on paper are very much unclear at first. The rules provide a set of restrictions but how to translate those into "good play" is not at all obvious. 

Mind you, I don't think that's a negative. In fact, if anything, I'd consider that a plus, providing a deeper field of learning. It does mean, however, that you practically need to fly blind for the first couple of engagements, trying to build up experience on what happens when you poke an enemy stack like [i]this[/i], or set up your defenses like [i]that[/i] and catching a bloody nose or two in the process.

The system itself is very entertaining, and the game is quite beautiful as well. If there is a problem with the rules it's that they are totally unsuited as a reference. I'm not yet sure how to rate the game, but I'm quite confident it won't end up below a 7.

The ruleset was difficult to get our heads around but on just a few plays I've seen quite a bit of promise.

Time will tell, but so far so good.

RATING: N/A
A positively stellar map and components- just like an old Napoleonic battle map coming to life. This being said, it's not played yet, as I'm still digesting the rules. As everyone has said, the rules, though declared as streamlined and short in length, are so different from anything I've experienced and therefore difficult to get my head around- and extremely counter-intuitive- and every word counts. It appears more like chess, than actual Napoleonics, at least in reading. My fear is that all sense of fighting a Napoleonic battle might be lost since you would spend most of your tun sticking your nose into the rule book to check and check again. Others have mentioned how cavalry is no faster than infantry, and how the attacker can suddenly change his type of attack with the defender not able to adjust (this runs in reverse of reality). 

My gut tells me to hold onto this game just for the components and the hope that someone else will come up with a different rules-set (or I will). But perhaps I need to just bite the bullet and dive into the rules repeatedly, bash them over my head, until it all makes sense. I would love to make this beautiful game work someday.

This is probably the best block style war game. I can see there is a lot of strategy involved in how you advance and try to pin down/out maneuver your opponent. The mechanics are unique and interesting and the components are very functional and aesthetically pleasing. If I liked these types of tactical maneuvering games this would probably be my favorite type of game in the category. Unfortunately I'm not really a big fan of this genre so I'm not as likely to really want to play it much. It is always hard to rate these games because I recognize that it is a really good game, it is just not the type of game that I really like to play. Since my ratings are subjective and I don't try to provide objective ratings here I have to give it a 6 but I strongly recommend to those war gamers that enjoy tactical war games where you are really trying to out maneuver your opponent.

The best (and most complicated) luckless combat system around because victory is not total; even if you win a fight you still lose men.

Also this game is beautiful to behold. I wish there was a little more chrome, like rules for Murat, but alas you can't have it all!

Bumped it down a point for some pretty arcane rules writing. Bonaparte at Marengo is superior in this regard.

It seems to be everything that I enjoy in games - intense, competitive and grand strategic maneuvers. The game captures the "feel" of Napoleonic leadership and the maneuvers felt completely right.

Want to get more plays but so far I am joining the games hpye.

No doubt an excellent game, but just not for me. It doesn't show me the things I want to see in a Napoleonic game, and I find the mechanics tedious. A shame, because my regular gaming buddy really like the system. I tried to like it, really, I did! But I don't.

First tentative rating. 

I've started a game on Vassal, as for now there has been a lot of dancing around, but now I believe there will be blood. :)

UPDATE
I've played a whole tabletop game. I liked it even if rules mistakes were made. Full of tension, this is the kind of games I love. I hope the love holds up. :)

UPDATE
Ok played once again. What a game! This deserves a "9", and possibly a future 10. 
The realities of Napoleonic warfare are rendered into a simple, yet not simplistic, elegant way. Not for the faint-hearted, you need to keep a close look at what the enemy cavalry can do, if you don't, your units will be soon surrounded and destroyed! All works to the tipping point where the fate of the struggle stands on a thin balance, then, when you smell blood, you cry "Guards Attack!" and lead your army to victory or down in flames.

rules take a bit to get your mind around if you are a conventional wargamer.  they are written fine, but understanding what you should and should not be doing from the rules would be very difficult.

RATING: 9
Napoleon´s Triumph is completely different from anything I´ve played previously. It´s diceless block combat, with a huge emphasis on subtle deception and maneuver. It also has very, very nice components, the map helps to create an appropriate period feel.

I feel that I´m just beginning to get into the game after three plays; learning it with another NT beginner without previous experience of Mr.Simmons´ games has been a bit of a challenge, though assisted greatly by the designer´s commentaries on threads and the playaid files here on BGG.

What I´ve gathered so far: this is a really, really elegant game and also actually not at all bad a depiction of Austerlitz. It has the potential to rise up to a 10 when I get more experienced with it.

The rules are manageable, eventually--and the attack declaration procedure is actually rather attractive rules-wise. The lines got a bit too settled for my tastes, and it seems as though the match balances on a knife-edge such that a single mistake can cause a collapse. 
In short, a testament to brilliant game design, but I'm not sure it moves me.

Really clever game with neat mechanics and terrific components - a huge map and stylishly minimal blocks. The commander flags are kind of fiddly and the stickers don't attach to the metal well, which is a bit of a disappointment. 

It's hard to wrap your head around the rules and the manual, while not written badly, does make it a little hard to find some important things as it's so terse.

Overall though, fantastic game and a ton of fun to play.

RATING: 5
Tactical - Napoleonic - Medium

Brilliant design but you either like it or you don't. I really tried to like it but unfortunately it is not for me so take my rating with a pinch of salt. 

Plus:
-Historic context is there but history too much of trac k to really enjoy
-Unique system, if you master to get the system right there is an interesting game system here, however mastering the rules correctly is a real challenge (as in my case, see minus).
-Great quality components; 2 hardmounted maps, wood, iron
I simply can' understand that a private publisher is able to produce a wargame with 2 superb hardmounted maps, wooden blocks and iron stands for 50 Euro.
Bowen Simmons is an example for all wargame publishers and designers alike. 

Minus:
-Learning the rules CORRECTLY will make your head spin. After many attempts I gave up on it.
Maybe it is me but I am never sure if I play correctly and this I hate about myself. Silly but I don't have issues with 36 pages of rules in games, but here I struggle with 8 pages for whatever reason.
The same is true for BAM. I lost interest so I sold it and I am thinking to sell unless I get a player to teach me. 
I gave the system a 2nd chance. You either love it or hate it and I really want to love it but unfortunately I can't.    

What is bothering me most is my own frustration that the rules seem simple but the system is so COUNTER INTUITIVE, I don't get it. 

Again, I really tried to like Napoleon's Triumph but the truth is I don't....

I love everything about this game. It packs a tremendous amount of tension and action into a 3-hour or so playing time. The game gives you oodles possibilities and things to think about. It has a perfect balance of fluidity and constraint. Well worth the effort to learn. It's a fun and intriguing game even when you're losing. Great conflict simulation: when I play NT, I think about the historical battle rather than this thing made of cardboard and wood.

A description of the game by the highly quotable Matt Thrower (BGG user [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/user/MattDP]MattDP[/url]):

"Napoleon's Triumph is a wargame unlike most others. It is in fact so unlike most others that what ought to be a relatively simple game with a modest eight pages of rules is in fact quite a struggle to learn because it presents you with so many unfamiliar concepts and offers no guidance on how to translate them into effective play. But don't be put off by those jagged edges: this is a first class game which not only plays well but looks a million dollars too with its minimalist-yet-stunning design which leaves you feeling like you're really a Napoleonic general pushing unit markers around a map while sat in a tent on a hill overlooking the battlefield. The designer claimed he was looking for a game experience that combined that of chess with that of poker, and he got it. All your units start the game concealed from your opponent and during attacks it's quite common for only a couple to be revealed on each side. So you start the game moving your units around in a startlingly heavyweight game of grand manoeuvre (that's the chess) but once combat is joined you're sweating over what might be arrayed over the other side of the board against you and struggling to bluff your opponent into thinking that he's facing a guards division instead of some irregular Cossacks (that's the poker). This uncertainty means that the diceless combat system works perfectly well: your attempt to predict what has taken the field against you simply replaces your attempt to predict the probabilities of the dice. A lot of wargames don't actually manage to capture the bluff element inherent in strategic warfare but this does, and yet alongside it it also manages to truly reward commanders who can come up with a creative battle plan and implement it whilst remaining flexible to the demands of the changing situation. In other words it manages to be a great game, a great historical mirror and a great military simulation all at the same time. I can imagine that like many wargames the limitations of the scenario might start to show in time, but the hidden units, the second, longer scenario and the team play option should help keep things fresh. It's a little heavy for my tastes, but I've not yet tried that compelling and unique team play approach which promises to capture some of the real pressures of command." -- [url=http://fortressat.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1119&Itemid=551]Matt Thrower[/url]

RATING: 10
The rulebook is abhorringly bad! (But the game is phenomenally good!)
You'll never understand how to play this game by just reading the rulebook. You have to download the annotated rulebook, the FAQ & the visual helpers here from BGG.
And even then you'll have to invest about 12 hours.

No visual distinction between rules, no didactic build-up, not enough graphical examples..

Getting teached the game is MUCH! more preferable, because the game itself isn't very difficult, just very "uncommon".
(try to find someone who'll teach you!)

Having said all of this, i think the game is the pinnacle in wargame-design of today. In fact once you become familiar with all the rules, something clicks in your head and you become aware of all strategic options this system gives you.

I actually don't know where to start with all the praise, so i'll write that down another time.. for now let's just say that this is the most beautiful game in the universe..

The only wargame I've played (I'm no grognard so that doesn't necessarily mean too much) that gives a real feeling for "lines of battle".

In the movie Gettysburg (also in the book The Killer Angels) a big deal is made about how they are the "end of the line" and if they fall then the entire Union line will roll up.

In too many other wargames it doesn't feel like being flanked is that bad. Sure, not ideal but not the end of the world.

In NT having units roll across your flank is a terrible feeling.

The only wargame I've played that makes me feel like a general and not micro-manager.

RATING: 9.5
I have played several times now, although never to the end and often with different players.  I love it.  The combat resolution appears very abstract at first and so the mildly complex decision tree flows very slowly during the first few games, but when you start to understand the logic behind it the game truly starts to shine.

Firstly this is a big improvement over Bonaparte at Marengo. The initial organisation into corps and subsequent disintegration as battle is joined provides lots of command and control problems, your army descends into chaos as the battle goes on. The huge board provides a very wide battlefield, it's easily possible to flank your opponent, there are no 'edge of the world' effects here. A couple of problems: the rules are the usual Bowen Simmons' legalese, there are no concessions to accessibility, second the corps commander pieces are gorgeous to behold, but completely impractical, the stickers are too small to adhere without glue. This is definitely a game you have to play regularly to get a handle on, it's just a shame there are no other maps to play using the same system.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
An interesting game. I will need more plays to get a definite feel. So far I like it and want to play more. I like how the aliies are almost forced to attack against napoleon in order to force him to commit his reserves. A very elegant desing, if somewhat calculation intensive.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a brain burner. It is a highly tactical, elegant game, that will take a lot of thought. The mechanics are well designed and add to the designer's intention of creating a very thematic 19th century tactical wargame, where you have some idea of the enemies armies, but not necessarily their full strength. 

The rules are un-intuitive and difficult to remember on the first play. I'd like to try this again sometime, but maybe after a break, as I feel that the four hours the first game took could have been used to play something more strategically satisfying and easier (read: more intuitive) to understand.

This is my favorite block game. The two features that of this game that make this game for me are the algorithmic combat and, the map.

The algorithm is eliminates the need for dice, or cards without turning the game into a game of chess.  The movement of men during the battle is not broken up by players taking time out to complete one battle then moving on the the next. The fighting is not instantaneous ether.  You really get the sense that battle lines are forming large armies are trying to flank each other, or force their way through a week spot in the opponents line.  Unfortunately I could never do this game justice by writing about it you will have to play it yourself.

RATING: 9
First three plays. The game components are impressive; the map is huge for a mounted board and both the map and blocks impart a nice period feel to the game. Although a considerable amount of information is displayed on the map, it manages to be practical. The only minor problems are that some of the locales are too small to show clearly whether the blocks are in reserve or blocking an approach, and the stacking limit numbers are both indistinct and liable to be concealed by the blocks. As for the game itself, I was even more impressed. Without any complex rules, cards or dice, Napoleon's Triumph succeeds both in imparting the theme of the battle and in creating a tense and even unpredictable game-playing experience. Perhaps the only deficiencies in the package are the rather opaque rule book and the lack of a player aid; even on my second game I missed some of the rules.

Wargame napoleonico muy bien considerado. Las unidades se representan con palitos y banderas.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Very refreshing to play a Wargame with no randomness and still retain the feel of a battlefield.  

I found it had a similar feeling to Chess/Go in that it's a very strategic game that mostly revolves around movement. The Fog of War effect keeps tensions up and fosters some poker like bluffing as well retaining the realism of battle. Much has been taken into account here and there are several very cool aspects such as the limited time, different victory conditions, map effects and the French reinforcements which are "optional", all great inclusions.

Some rules are tricky no doubt but most make thematic sense (some still are a little unintuitive and opaque) so once you get going they start getting easier, still even though only 9 rule pages there are lots of little tricky things to remember but compared to other games with charts and such, a dream! (Compare to even War of the Ring, if you can learn that then this is no problem) Note that it is the rules/mechanics that help to simulate the advantage of defense, the advantage of preparation, the dangers of being flanked and the many other details of war so everything included was necessary to get the right feel and not just leave it feeling like an abstract. The main thing you will find about the mechanics and rules here are they are very different to other wargames so there is a learning curve no doubt about it. I suggest to print out some of the aids here on BGG and that will go a long way to help.   

There really is the grand scope feeling of controlling an entire army on the battlefield and never knowing exactly how or where your opponent will defend or attack certain areas. You have a large amount of control (again refreshing!) over your plans, troops, etc so when shit happens, you know it was you that messed up and not "the game" messing you up. Also be prepared for some engrossing calculation and cerebral stimulation in good doses.  

The game is tension filled, beautiful to look at, seemingly balanced for both sides as well as time wise and Morale (endgame balance), historically interesting with good depth and planning required and can play in 3 hours so should have a pretty broad appeal (even Eurogamers) if someone wants to take the time to learn the nuances of the rules. 

[u]UPDATE[/u] 9 => 8.5 Bluddy rules are a pain in the ass bigtime and ruined some enjoyment for me. There are tons of little things to remember and lots of little exceptions that creep up and reading the rules and some other aids barely helped. I plan on making my own 2 page exception list where the really tricky crap and hard to remember things are all listed. Rating might go back up then. 


[u]Tidbit[/u]

I see good replay value especially with the longer scenario and being able to play both sides with different objectives but I also have another easy idea to implement in case anyone wants to try it and I'm sure I will just for fun. Leave all the starting units the same but just change the positions in the static setup, this way its a different game but not a longer one. (probably won't even try this for 10 or 20 games)

I have not played this enough to comment on the gameplay in any depth.  One of the hardest things about learning the rules is unlearning BaM.

--- A note on Simmons Games in general.
Bowen has produced a beautiful game with NT, and he stands behind it.  He contacted me to ask if I had any issues with the components.  My red pieces were printed off-center, but I forgot to reply to him.  8 months later, I asked him about the pieces again, and he very quickly shipped replacements to me.  He was very professional about the whole situation and sets a high bar for customer service.

I think there's a brilliant design here.  However, I couldn't wrap my head around the rules alone.  I was taught the game and I still don't get "how the game works".  I can figure out individual mechanics but not how to make it all work together.

RATING: 7
One play only. Very innovative system ported from Simmon's earlier Marengo game but with additional command  activation rules that add to the flavour. Movement is simple and fairly intuitive if you have some knowledge of the period, but one game wasn't sufficient to fully understand the implications of the combat system which while simple in concept has a number of wrinkles that can greatly affect the outcome.

Probably not a good choice as someone's first wargame, but the learning curve isn't as sharp as I initially feared.

Two games under my belt now, and while I think I have the attack procedure close to nailed down in my head, I'm still at a loss when it comes to looking at the board and figuring out where to be and when. It seems like we were too hasty to launch into major engagements--well, I must have been, because I suffered two devastating reverses that shattered big corps and caused losses to units stuck in different approaches. 

The rules make a [b]lousy[/b] reference, I'm afraid. They are concise and don't duplicate a single thing anywhere, which is admirable--but it means that I frequently found myself paging back and forth trying to find the little rules snippet that I *swear* I read about a certain nuance of a move or attack. The hardest but most important thing is to leave any assumptions you bring with you from other games at the door.

I think what I appreciate most about it is a large footprint game which meets its advertised 120-180 minute playing time.  Bowen deserves credit for this result.

Biggest complaint?  The diceless combat generates a lot of complexity and "guff" for what is often a very predictable outcome.  The contrast between the effort and payoff required to resolve an engagement can be frustrating.  A part of me thinks dice would have allowed a more streamlined process for the players and significantly reduced the task load generated by the combat system.

RATING: 6
My subjective evaluation after one play differs notably from its undoubtable qualities as a game. Seldomly, I've been so at loss about what to do or even how to play according to the rules. It might be that my rating will/would rise considerably with more plays but I'm not sure if that will happen as I'm left with mixed feelings about this Chess-like remake of Stratego as a real wargame without any random elements.
For once, I'm not a wargamer at heart and I prefer tactical optimization to strategic planning. So, NT isn't a good fit for my preferences. I also can't enjoy games too much where I'm dabbling around on a low point of the learning curve for a long time. To get higher on the curve would need a huge effort with each game taking two to three hours.
All this doesn't say anything about its qualities. Foremost, it's one of the most innovative designs in the last 10 years. There's considerable depth to be found, replayability of a game simulating a single battle scarcely could be higher, skill is decisive, it has a very stylish appearance etc. As any geek around here considering himself a gaming connoisseur, I would love to enjoy this as it sounds perfect on paper. But probably, my taste isn't perfect enough for it.

RATING: 3.5
Rules seem Greenwood-esque.  I'm sure they are all there but they are difficult to find.

Post-game talk revealed a game that is strong on planning and post-contact adaptation, but the implementation was rocky.  I can see casual rules-readers playing the game incorrectly session after session, but the quick playtime and the game's beautiful physical presentation make it easy to start again.  Ultimately though, the combat narrative made no sense to us and the command narrative wasn't that much better.  If not for the beautiful presentation and the designer's fascinating earlier design BaM, I suspect this would have gone straight to the dustbin.

I am sure the game does exactly what the designer wanted it to do.  Despite it being a huge disappointment for me, I will be first in line to get his next game, since this is one of the few designers who try to break new ground.

The rules were a bit confusing in dealing with announcing attack threats, feints, and retreats.  I think this is in part because some of the phrasing of the rules for movement and combat seems to be variations of each other when specifying unit presence on an approach or reserve.  It seems that Mr. Simmons could declare at the top of the rules section that movement into or from reserve position is universally applied for all movement and combat details, and then provide side-bar for exceptions.  I think he could save another page from the already concise rules set.

If there are two of us, and we don't have time for EastFront, this is going to be one of the games I suggest.  Unfortunately, my friends are not real interested in the theme.

[url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/1919920#1919920]Here[/url] are some things I like better about NT than BaM, and [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/1720243#1720243]here[/url] (and the post which follows it) are some comments on concepts from BaM which you need to forget when playing NT.

Older notes:
I've only gotten to play once so far, but my first impressions are that A) you certainly don't need to be familiar with Bonaparte at Marengo to enjoy this--in fact, there are some things in the rules which I would probably find [i]more[/i] clear if I didn't have to un-learn some stuff from BaM--and B) if you didn't like BaM, [b]you still need to check this out;[/b] the amount of control you have over your initial setup, the large groups of units--a single corps contains 2/3 of the entire French setup in BaM--and higher-stakes combat (the winner loses no morale, and the defender gets to throw more units into the fight) may fix whatever you didn't like about BaM.

Update: after a second play and some thinking about the systems, I really doubt I will ever play BaM again anywhere but in the ladder tournament; I think NT is better in every way.

Update: after a third play (and my second 4-player game), I still feel that way.  This game was "swingy" in a good way: at one point we (the Allies) had knocked the French down to something like 11 morale to our 21.  Then they knocked us down to 9 ("mistakes were made").  Then we ground each other down to like 2 to 1, and we narrowly squeaked out a win from what had looked like a foregone conclusion.  And this was all in a game which ended in the 11AM turn!  Incredibly brutal.

By the way, the prohibition against communication in the team game may seem gimmicky when you read the rules, but it's [b]really cool[/b] in practice.  You have to predict your opponents' [i]and your teammates'[/i] plans, and it actually moves [i]faster[/i] than 2-player games.  You have to try this.

The most beautiful game ever made, but it can be really hard to understand how to play it.  I've only played solitaire, but definitely want to play opposed.  The best thing about it is how the pieces make the map look like the maps of battles in history books.  It really feels like you get to live a historical event when you play.

An interesting reworking of the Bonaparte at Marengo system into a larger battle.  The corps command structure is well handled.  The map and pieces are among the best I've ever seen in a wargame.  Further play (without botching rules) will be necessary before I can give a truly well-reasoned rating.  I must admit that I enjoy the tension of the hidden units but miss that element of chance that dice provide in most wargames.

A natural extension of the successful block chits game on the Napoleonics.  Look nice from an aerial view but I prefer the CoA lavish style of counters more.  Some good feedbacks from fellow BGGers Who like Maths and tactical decisions and some less than fascinated from those who don't like deterministic combat system. Either way I am more interested in the game than before.

A truly elegant and well thought-out game of tactical Napoleonic warfare!

You need to have a few plays to wrap your head around the concepts, but once that is done everything becomes a lot more intuitive!

I'd like more details (but then I'm a crome-nut), but its hard to to that without compromising the elegance of the design, and it really is elegant, once you get under the hood of it.

I'm not too sure about replayability, and so much of each new battle lies in the terrain analysis and board design, that it's not easily done. If you know one, though, you know them all, basically.

I'd like to play this more (and not loose on a technicality, like the first time ;) )

(I don't comment on anything but abstract games. Here's an exception) 

I could extoll the virtues of this amazing game... and hey, I will!

NT is a genius piece of work. Sure this statement may bloat the perhaps already large ego of its designer but genius is genius and one has to recognize it when it happens. The feeling that I get when playing this game must give me some small inkling what it was like or maybe what it is like to be a commander sending one's troops out: planning, frustration, uncertainty, the bearing out of correct decisions, the kick-in-the-ass when a decision turns to dust as you realize defeat. This game feels "authentic" for some reason. The only thing that I think that it lacks is slightly more variable rules as far as cavalry vs. infantry (especially movement - yeah, I know 'road movement' blah, blah, blah but the movement feels a tad shortchanged nonetheless IMO).

Not only is this a great 2-player game but this game is even better with 6 or more. AGONIZING is the only word to describe it as you see a team-mate reach the apparent wrong conclusion and there's nothing you can do until the 'Night Turn' (if you're playing the 2 day scenario) or the sheer thrill at seeing your team thrive in the chaos that presents itself every single turn and turning that into advantage after advantage. 

LOVE. THIS. GAME!

The looks are great, and any use of fog of war in a wargame is to be lauded, but it's a bit too artificial for my taste overall... I had a hard time mapping the things I was doing to decisions of the era, and so the fire and immersion was just not there. Could see myself playing this occasionally, for the challenge. To be sure, a significant improvement over Bonaparte at Marengo which gave no feeling of the historicaly battle of Marengo at all.

MASTERPIECE.

The game is pure elegance.

Battles are not won over one round of combat. If often takes rounds upon rounds to break an opponent's position.

Bluffing is integral to the game. Set-up itself involves lots of bluffing. Your opponent will question where your strength is. Besides that, the attack procedure itself is based on bluffing. During an attack, the defense will have to try to determine how many and what troops to commit to that particular approach. This is because troops named as defense during an attack on a certain approach can not be later named as defense to another approach front. 

There are three basic units in the game. Infantry, cavalry, and artillery. That's it. But they all function in a way that makes them feel like what they are. 

Maneuver is vital. An opponent's lone cavalry behind your lines can be devastating. Getting a surround on a corps can mean the end to it. It is important to consider the position of your units in respect to roads and terrain penalties.

Napoleon's Triumph is the game of Kings.

Update 9: Not hitting the table as much as it did; but still gets a lot of online play (Cyberboard). 

NT is an even greater action packed Napoleonic fight-fest than its predecessor, Bonaparte at Marengo. The challenge just in establishing your corps properly and setting up is immense. Then, the actual fighting. More flanking? More head on? Send in the cavalry! Fire the artillery! Slog the men forward into withering fire. Awesome!

RATING: N/A
This is an intriguing alternative approach to grand tactical Napoleonic battles.  At the point of deciding to purchase, I preferred it over the Marshall Enterprises re-make of La Bataille de Austerlitz.

I now have a little bit of game play under my belt.

It reminds me of an intricately and cleverly constructed abstract.

My wargaming taste usually runs to what might be described as more granular representations of warfare.  My main loves in the genre have a lot of detail.

I do not suggest that games with more granularity and detail are more accurate representations than NT is of the battles (or campaigns etc) which they depict.

The Gamers Austerlitz, La Bataille d'Austerlitz and Napoleon's Triumph all show that famous battle in entirely different ways.

NT is incredibly elegant.  It succeeds, in my view, in achieving all of its stated design goals.  It is tense and fun to play.  Either side can win.

Having come to it very late (10 years after initial publication), I quickly came to appreciate what all the fuss was about.  It is a stunningly successful design.  In that sense, it reminds me of Twilight Struggle.

But ... I think ultimately it is not really my style of wargame.

I respect it, and would even go as far as to say I admire it.  More than that, I am impressed by NT.

But I don't find myself itching to play it when I am not.  At least not at this stage of my evolution as a gamer.  I may move beyond the detailed games which have absorbed me for the last not-so-little while.  And if I do, I will put out my copy of NT, with perhaps a greater appreciation of its joys - from close up, rather than from afar.

I have decided not to rate the game.  It is the first game to which I can remember having this response:  wow!  But not for me.  Usually the wow is enough.  It deserves a 10 in one way, but it is not a 10 in my heart.  So I will refrain from giving a compromise rating that would seem equally inaccurate.

undoubtedly a great game! it is complex but not too complicated. it reveals the atmosphere of napoleonic battles. it is absolutely balanced and can be played in 2-4 hours which is perfect for a quick game in one evening. the only reason why I don't rate it 10: I am relatively new to wargames. so I don't want to give max. points because I obviously don't have the expertise... but it is definitely the best wargame I ever played...

Beautiful components but poor combats system. No leadership involve with a superficial command structure. Without either units moral, terrain effect, troops quality involved in defence during combats. The Imperial Guard is equal in defense to the worst Allies unit. Need a good old combats table and a bit of luck with the help of some dices. A chess game with artificial Napoleonic favor.  Conclusion; a good game but a average simulation.

6/25/08: 5th play.  Updated rating to 10.  Seeing the game flow, learning to look upon the board to see good vs. bad positioning, watching as corps slowly (and often quickly) break apart, and just the great, tense, competition with one's opponent... this is a remarkable game.

6/6/08: Third play (took way too long to get to the table).  Rating up a half-point to 9.5.  Great, great game.  Looks fantastic on many levels, plays magnificently on even more levels.

8/22/07: Owned but so far unplayed (okay, I've actually had possession of it for 45 minutes so far).  Beautiful production values.  Sturdy, gorgeous map, cool metal leader stands, wood tokens as markers, and the same great red and blue playing pieces.

Update, later that same day: Tentatively rated a 9 after one play.  Great tension, and Bowen Simmon's mantra of "less chess, more poker" rings true.  In this game, you have to come up with your plan and then hope it works against whatever plan your opponent has devised.  Clean, subtle rules, beautiful components, and tense gameplay.  I expect this rating to go up.

The strategic considerations are massive.  It is quite difficult to formulate a successful approach to this game, which in the end, might be a great thing.

Rating based on 2 players.

More than any other wargame I've played so far, Napoleon's Triumph feels like watching a battle unfold: the maneuvering, the constantly changing battlefield, the feeling that one small mistake can unravel all. The visual design of the game is great in this aspect as well.

Sometimes you want dice, and sometimes you want to be fully in control of your destiny, and the latter is where NT sits. This game is all about out-thinking your opponent, with deterministic combat and absolutely no luck. However, deterministic does not mean attacks are a foregone conclusion, or boring. The use of blocks creates uncertainty of your opponent's strengths and plans, and while the attack sequence follows a rather elaborate flow-chart of decisions, it's in the many decisions leading up to the attack where victory really lies. Timing and positioning are crucial. 

The ruleset is very dense (this is indeed a heavy game), but to me all the rules make sense, and it's a matter of practice and making the effort to understand the sequences (in that aspect, the game is much easier to process by seeing it in action over the rulebook, but I can't imagine learning it on the fly--get the facts first via the rulebook, then get the full story via playthroughs). Once something is understood, everything falls into place, and there's less to memorize. Nothing felt like a rule just for the sake of making a rule, and it's rather elegant how so many battle considerations can be condensed into a (relatively) short rulebook.

I admit I went into this one with high expectations, and it met every one. This 10 might be a little early, but I was fully engaged throughout, and I can only see myself liking this more with repeated play and a better grip with the rules.

Possibly the most innovative game I've come across - I can find virtually no reference points at all, except maybe a slight nod to the Columbia block games. One  result of this is that the rules, though fairly short, have a very steep learning curve because the translation between such unfamiliar rules and their application into tactics and strategy is extremely obtuse. The resulting game is surprisingly heavy in terms of manoeuvre and analysis - I find parallels with a chess game - more so than I usually like. It has the distinction of being in the small group of wargames in which psychology and bluff really can make a huge difference to the result and also of being in another small group of games which work well when played in teams.

Excellent game builds on the mechanisms of BaM to make for a tension-filled experience.

Edit: After one playing, WOW, this is a good game. Once you get a grip on the rules, fascinating system which gives Artillery, Cavalry and Infantry (and elite Guards Infantry and Cavalry) all their proper place. We were playing stupidly, just to see what would happen, lots of bloody defeats. It's going to take a bunch of plays to get a feel for good play. Best Napoleonic game I've played.

I think this is really a 5, but it maybe deserves a 6 for the interesting ideas and mechanics.

I played this at BGG.CON (kindly taught by kuhrusty) with three other first-time players, and it was a struggle. We made many mistakes, and I was probably the worst offender.

Some of the combat rules seemed counterintuitive to me--extremely counterintuitive--and some just plain didn't make sense. Some of this is undeniably due to unfamiliarity with the rules (since I haven't read them, only had them explained to me). But I can't say I was sold on the combat system, despite its innovativeness.

Just opening the box takes you to another level when it comes to wargamimg. The quality and workmanship of the components is outstanding. The game plays rather fast for being this big and most of all it is fun and entertaining. Who said wargaming is all about CRT's, counters and hexes? Not me, I think this gives me a better feeling of wargaming. Now I can concentrate on maneuvering units and not the maneuver process itself.

Bought from a friend.  Looking forward to playing it.  Short playtime has me intrigued.

Feb '17:  This may come off as a bit gushing but this was quite a good game.  The rules are a bit of a tough hack, and have to be read carefully and literally but the game itself is not to difficult once you get the exceptions worked out.  Then it leaves you open for strategy, and that is what I am only glimpsing.  I know next to nothing of Napoleonic tactics, which hampers good play, but I did figure out you need to run a few failed attacks to soften up the enemy and make your attack at this weak point, and be swift to exploit before they reorganize: I did not manage this latter point well.  Looks stunning on the table and does play pretty quickly.  We finished the main scenario in about three hours, with some very slow turns as we refered to the rules.  Got a couple things wrong, but fixed up errors where we found them along the way.  Thrilled to have finally got a play in.

Four plays. I love what Bowen has done for the hobby with his craftsmanship, but I wish there wasn't such a disconnect between the satisfaction derived from the game's components and the mental gymnastics that the multi-tiered decision trees demand for each combat. That said, my fourth play was much more enjoyable--and much more competitive--than the first three. There's a learning curve here that has to be respected. Whatever else might be said for it, this is not the "simple" game the designer's notes claim as an objective.

Move your units to break your opponent’s morale or to control most victory areas at Austerlitz.

Plays: More than a dozen?
Type: Wargame = a game where you move military forces on a map to destroy other military forces and/or conquer territory. Blocks and area movement style. Tactical scale.
Complexity: Medium wargame.

Playing time: 240 mins.
Player interaction: Conflict. Misdirection.
Randomness: None.

Replayability: Both high and low. It has great depth and you’re itching to try out new tactics for both sides. But it's so frustrating! The combat mechanics are pure and elegant, but also very harsh. One tiny mistake somewhere can unhinge your entire line and lose the game. Every unit has to be positioned just so. Argh, the pressure! You need a fresh mind and lots of energy to play this game.
Fun: The design is pure genius. It’s fun to play something so perfect. 
Memorability: Very high. You feel like Napoleon himself. The presentation of the game helps a lot with creating a story, as it looks like it could be taken straight out of a book on famous battles. There is huge uncertainty but no randomness, so you’re playing your opponent more than the board, which makes for a memorable experience. And you’ll definitely remember the disasters, when you pushed your forces too far and they were annihilated because they couldn’t defend all the approaches.

Thematic integration: Very good.
Components: This game looks fantastic. The box, the board, the pieces, all outstanding. Probably the best looking game I have ever played.

Who will like this: For wargamers that want a Napoleonic game, this is it.

Very fun and challenging game.  When the board is set up for play, this game looks as cool as any game I have ever seen.  The designer/artist did an excellent job with the map and pieces.  The game-play is unique, and somewhat difficult at first, in how one plans and executes maneuvers.  It really requires some forethought in order to execute a plan of action well.  The movement/attack mechanics, creation/detachment of Corps, fog of war, artillery placement, devastating effects of battle loss on moral, etc., all come together to make a fast-playing, exciting, and engaging game.  And best of all, their are no dice!

Edit:  After pulling this off the shelf again, we realized we had gotten a couple of rules wrong in our first series of plays.  We also realized that the (actual) rules are quite hard to grok.  Even after several more plays we still found ourselves digging in the rulebook.  Had to knock it down a point for lack of accessibility.

This game is incredible. From the map - no hexes! - to the units, simple wooden bars. No points, no dice, no CRT. You FEEL like you're Napoleon planning your moves to storm that bloody right flank.

To be honest, I like the Gettysburg map (and artillery) more, but NT is such a great game. High praise to Rachel Simmons for her great design and innovative thinking - probably so innovative that the system is grasped more easily by non-wargamers...

Very impressed. The box is big (but not too large or oversized) and heavy.  The components are first class.  The map board is solid and mounted on heavy/thick stock, not to mention that it looks great.  The commander pieces are metal and look good after applying the stickers.  This is one minor quibble, but the stickers are larger than the metal plate they are applied to and look a little sloppy.  Otherwise, the components are great.   The novel terrain/combat/troop placement system from the earlier Marengo game is the core of the game.  All in all, a very good game recreating one of history's famous battles.

The ultimate Austerlitz game, and the jewel in my collection. Takes several plays to get into, but that is oh, so rewarding. Careful planning, improvising, risk-taking and bluffing, everything playing out on a beautiful map which makes history come alive.
The game demands many skills from the player, including patience. Timing can be critical. Suspense can last the whole game through, as the game may not be decided until the last round.

It's a gorgeous game and I can't help thinking I ought to love it more than I do, since it models Napoleonic conflict so well.  But I find the movement and battles fiddly and unintuitive, and with this particular system, either you buy into it or you don't.  I want to, but I just don't.  And the deterministic combat feels so lifeless, I don't see the thrill in the fighting at all.  Since it's a wargame, that's a problem.

Terrific looking game with a great unique system.  I like this game a lot better than it's predecessor Bonaparte at Marengo.  The system is terrific once grasped, but that's not too easy as the rules are difficult to understand as written.  They are almost too painstakingly detailed for what is essentially a relatively simple system.  The forest gets lost for the trees sometimes.  My one other criticism is that that system plays out more like an American Civil War battle than a Napoleonic one.  At least that's how it feels to me.  Nonetheless I really do recommend this game for Napoleonic buffs like myself.

[b]Napoleon's Triumph[/b] by Rachel Simmons

2 players (or 2 teams)

Learning Tips: https://boardgamegeek.com/article/26407346#26407346
Annotated rules

(From the publisher)
[i]
Napoleon’s Triumph is built on the same foundations as its acclaimed predecessor, Bonaparte at Marengo, but is bigger and grander in scale. It uses two boards to make a double-size 44" x 34" map of the Austerlitz battlefield and has twice as many pieces as the earlier game, but defying the tradition that big wargames must also take a long time to play, Napoleon’s Triumph can be played from start to finish in a single evening.

From Back of Box
On December 2, 1805, on the battlefield of Austerlitz, an outnumbered French army led by their newly crowned emperor, Napoleon, waited to receive an expected attack by a Russian and Austrian army commanded by the Russian Czar, Alexander. Napoleon lured the Allies into attacking with their left wing, and when the Allies did so, a surprise French counter-attack smashed the Allied right and centre, and then surrounded and destroyed the Allied left in one of the most famous and decisive battles in military history.

Napoleon's Triumph re-creates that historic battle. Befitting its epic subject, Napoleon's Triumph is played on a double-sized 44" x34" map of the battlefield.

In spite of the game's size, it is easy to learn and fast to play. The rules are only nine pages long, and the playing time is only two hours. Napoleon's Triumph is unique among big wargames in that players can learn the game, set it up, and play it to completion in a single evening.

The game system is derived from its award-winning forebear, Bonaparte at Marengo. Like that game, Napoleon's Triumph breaks with almost all of the standard wargame conventions. It has no hex grid and terrain effects chart; terrain effects are designed into the map itself. It has no combat results table; combat is resolved through strength differential. It has no dice; tension comes from limited information and the outcome only depends on the players' decisions.

Napoleon's Triumph is a unique wargame experience. It is large, yet fast-playing. It has simple rules, but deep game play that rewards both boldness of conception and attention to detail. It stays close enough to history to engross wargamers and other students of the period, while still being entertaining enough for even non-wargamers to enjoy.

Napoleon's Triumph is not only easy to learn and fast and exciting to play, it also is a great looking game due to its exceptional component quality. The map is mounted on a heavy board cut in the German style so that the playing surface is durable, stable, and flat, without the valleys of American-style mounted boards or the buckling of paper boards.

To represent opposing armies, the game comes with 140 wooden blocks, blue for the French and red for the Allies. Painted on each block are symbols that identify the type and strengths of the unit. The senior commanders of the opposing armies are represented by 18 metal flags; stickers are applied to mark the nationality and name of each commander.

In play, Napoleon's Triumph combines the visual appeal of 19th century battle maps and military minatures, with columns and rows of units lined for movement and attack, accented by flags to indicate corps. The effect is simply stunning.[/i]

Beautiful original game, with very tense and exciting battles, lasting not too long. One of the few wargames that I still like to play.

The reason I don't rate it higher is because of the hidden information (necessary in this game design of course) and that quite complicated tactical moves and calculation seem to be at least as important as strategy (and I do ptrefer strategy in games). 

A very good game, in any case.

We need more wargames as well made as this one. Beautiful components and the emphasis on maneuver and fog of war together create a very strong wargaming experience. 

As has been said a myriad times before, the rulebook can be hard to digest at first but once you get it down it´s fairly simple.

If there were more of this stuff I´d never play a traditional hex and counter again.

Also, despite the high price you really get your money´s worth here. A wargame with heirloom quality!

Napoleon's Triumph is a counterintuitive wargame that keeps fascinating me. I just love the game! It was Napoleon's Triumph game got me interested in Napoleon's Wars in the first place. Napoleon's Triumph is a good simulation of a captivating battle. The game is full of painful decisions and one is severely punished for bad moves. One big mistake can ruin everything and often does so players need to be careful. Yes, I have seen nightmares of the game! The rulebook is short but rules are very tricky and rather difficult to learn. Though, after few plays they become something of a second nature (but those first plays can be dreadful experiences). After those few plays the game does not feel abstract at all. You really feel like commanding an army. What else? Production value is very high. Components are nice and functional and evoke the era, the board sturdy and beautiful (but it tends to warp a bit). I would like to play Napoleon's Triumph more often but it is really hard to get new players to play it because of the investment in the rules they need to make.

We actually had quite a bit of difficulty playing correctly in our first go around, and I am still not completely sure how to play.

This is a great game and I like the fact that there are no dice.  The learning curve is steep, but well worth it if you like Napoleonic games.  While it is a bit clunky, I guess that's how those corps were to handle.  The rules are hard to follow but there are some great play aids out there.  Nerve and bluff are two of my favorite aspects of this game.

I can't settle 100% on this rating.  I'm sure there is a better game in there than what my rating is, but based on two Face-to-face playings, I'm not satisfied.

The map boards and pieces look great and give a neat look when set up (largely due to the corps command pieces), but after that I have questions.

The rules don't seem to be missing anything but are written in an unforgiving style - several KEY references seem hidden away in sections & may not be in the first place you'd think to glance (we found that missing even slight things was tough to go back and correct & was quickly frustrating, more so than other games in my opinion).  Maybe a 1 page player aid would have been perfect to remedy this?

Lastly combat can be brutal - and since this is mentioned in the designer notes it's not an unexpected thing - to the point of one bad attack being ruinous (yes - you'll learn the hard way and act with caution from there out).  Overall the combat system gave me more of a fell of the analytical gamer more than the commander in the field.

As I said above, I'm sure there's a better game than my rating and comments, but I'm not sure I'd recommend this for two players who had not played this before as is.

RATING: 7
Based on one play: Although there are not that many bits, don't be fooled, this is a heavy game. The focus is two fold, first the movement is quite complex and a huge part of the game as you maneuver around to get in the right position. Secondly, the battles can be very costly and taking part in one must be fully planned out. Playing either the French or the Allies, you must secure certain locations to win. To do this takes a lot of planning and reacting to your opponent. This is definitely not for everyone, but for those you would be interested, it is quite the intense game that requires a lot of planning.

Loved my first play of this game. After reading the rules, I was unsure what to expect in the dynamics of the gameplay or how to manage the necessary subtleties of maneuver. A few (game) hours in and armies squandered, I felt much more comfortable with it. I like how imperfect information enters through hidden unit strengths rather than dice. This turns each skirmish into a game theory problem, and gives the opportunity for bluffs and counter-bluffs.

I wish the rules had a section re-emphasizing various exceptions, as several of these are separated from the main rules they modify (ex. the rules about cav and obstucted terrain).

Bigger and brasher follow up to Bonaparte at Marengo.  The things it does well is implement a very sensible manner of implementing the corps level command structure of the armies that faced each other.  In particular, I note that the problem of command disintegration through a day of battle is captured organically, visually, and wholly.  It is simply breathtakingly beautiful game on epic scale.  

I had originally felt that the with the learning scale needed to master the system it would become a matter of 'alchemy,' and that it was too big a scale.  It may always be the case that this linear warfare system designed by Bowen Simmons will accentuate the difference in skill between new players and experienced ones, more than most other games. 

Nonetheless, I now believe this is a stunning game, which gets better with every play.

RATING: 8
Just learning the system.  Has the bevy of rules exceptions and chrome typical of most wargames, but in every other respect a remarkably elegant system (as the hyper has promised).  I've never played a wargame so effective at organically directing players to treat their forces as commanders had to.  Move too fast, and your lines are stretched and you become vulnerable to flank attacks.  Can't wait to try again and complete a scenario.  And I hear more is on the way:  Gettysburg, anyone?

RATING: 10
Very creative! How the designer succeeds in finding a way to give you the right feeling, but still keeps the rulebook very slim and playability high is simply astonishing. Complex but short and well written rules (stick to the exact wording of the rules and be happy). 

Brilliant system, excellent components, moderate price. The quality map and wooden/metal playing pieces pale most other companies' design and final production efforts. For ease of play I had to scrounge some other games for markers for moved corps etc., but this is a negligible trifle.

Unfortunately I have low playing opportunity for this one.

RATING: 10
A fascinating game, well balanced and detailed. The attack and movement rules are nuanced and require several plays before you understand the interactions. Visually an attractive game - very much reminds me of the maps used in military history. 
So I agree it is a good (and perhaps a great game), but is it Austerlitz? 
The victory conditions are brilliant, The Austro-Russians must attack and are at risk for the French to maneuver to a marginal victory. If the French take the reinforcements the roles are reversed and the French like Napoleon should try for a decisive victory. Very much captures the issues facing both commanders.
The corp rules give a feel for formations. A consolidated group of units is a powerful force. 
The game is very much one of maneuver, and as it progresses it becomes more difficult as the corps break up. The Russians only being able to move half of their corps captures their inferior command structure. 
Not as confident that the deterministic attack rules captures some of the uncertainty of committing your forces, however the fog of war with blocks counter balances the certainty of combat. You do find yourself sending units you expect to be defeated to break up a defense, using maneuver to disrupt defenses, committing just enough to prevent an attack success.  
Couple with the loss of morale for causalities incurred when you lose an engagement makes you very careful on how you commit your forces.

I played this about four times and still am unable to absorb all the rules, especially assault rules. If I'm unable to visualize the consequences of my moves, or even learn from bad moves, then the game's too frustrating for me. Unfortunately, I'm not much of a wargamer, especially about conflicts I'm not interested it.

I really should have played Bonaparte in Marengo before this. That game has a simpler system but still showcases the basic premises of this series:

* Never assault unless you know you will win
* Weaken your opponent before assaulting with maneuvering attacks (force your opponent to block approaches around a locale to dilute and spread out his forces, then attack the locale)
* Use calvary to discover where your opponent's "3-strengh" units are, because this is what wins assaults. Also they are great for maneuvering attacks.
* Use artillery as well to weaken your opponent's forces. Use frequently and cautiously.

RATING: 10
difficult game, there are a lot of exceptions in the rules and no rationales are given for all the rules and their exceptions , which is a pity because if the rationale for a rule and the consequences the rule has for strategic decision making would have been explained, the rules would have been easier to remember and the game also easier to play. So the rule book is seriously lacking, it plunges you in the deep and gives no other help. Stick with it because all this info is given in the forums, the designer explains al you need to know in the forums on bgg and consim....great game!
after 2 games, this is perfect! a 10!

Awesome game. It took me a little while to understand what I was supposed to do, but once I did this game rocked! Highly recommended. It also looks the part with the wooden blocks for troops and the area map, you do begin to feel like a general manoeuvring his troops.

The rule book is very concise which does make it hard to learn the game at first and I think it takes a few plays to understand what you can and cannot do. But there are many good player aids on BGG now to ease the learning process.

RATING: 9.3
This is a very pretty game. In fact it is so pretty it ceases to be game, yes the mechanics are little more than a complicated set of papers/scissors/stone welded too stratego, but that doesn't matter because you feel like a general surveying your troops, watching the ebb and flow of battle. Not only does it give that genuine feel for commanding troops, but the game is closely matched thanks to some rather clever victory conditions, and balances some clever asymettric elements between the two sides.

Okay, there are a few downsides (with such unusual mechanics the rules needed to be tighter, as it is you will need a couple of games and the 20 page FAQ) but even then the game would deserve a high rating. And on top of that, it genuinely plays in an evening.

RATING: 7
An excellent game, although I wish it had a solitaire feature.  Much like its predecessor, Bonaparte at Marengo, it gives a great feel for a Napoleonic tactical battle. Also like BaM, it is difficult to achieve the same historical result as to sequence of events. NT does do a great job of allowing for how the actual battle was fought as the Allies can easily simulate the historical attack on Sokolnitz and Telnitz on the weak French right.  So far, however I have been unable to duplicate the historical result coming from Napoleon's surprise assault on the Pratzen Plateau which broke the Allied center. I have even "story boarded" it using the historical OB, and still cannot duplicte the shattering blow to the Allied Center that Napoleon was able to achieve in the actual historical battle. Great "game" however and visually stunning!

Edited July 2015
I have played this and less over the years, so have downgraded it to a "7".  It has always fallen short in an "historical" sense in that it has not been able to replicate the historical flow of the battle.  It is a good game more like chess rather than being an historical simulation.

A very difficult and at times off-putting game to get into. The rules seem to be easy to understand at first, but actually translating them into action on the board is very difficult; there is something very oblique about them. It takes numerous games with major rules fluffs to get them right. 

Once in there, the action really does remind me of descriptions I have read of battles in that much is about giving your opponent the wrong impression of your intentions (as the actual battle was, it would seem). Almost a game to be more admired than enjoyed, but I need to give it some more plays first.

The game incredibly solves many of the problems you face while converting into a boardgame a classical miniatures game. Congratulations! Great dessign of units-facing, terrain effects, line of command and victory conditions. I'm not so happy with the idea of leaving all the random part of a game to the "hidding deployment" aspect of the armies. Fog of war is important and to calculate the actual momentum and strengh of a mass of blue grognards coming up the road very important... but to build all the combat system around this fact I think is a little too much.
Anyway, first session only took 3 hours. Rules clear and straight. Art excells all my expectations. A MUST for all the Bpnnie-period lovers.

The components are incredible. There are two Euro-style boards that make up the map, there are now metal leader pieces, and the plastic markers from BaM have been replaced with wooden discs. Looks great.

The game itself is a lot easier to follow than BaM, and feels less abstract / thinky. Lots of fun thus far, but I'll have to play it some more to see whether it's got the depth of BaM.

I'm a big fan of Bonaparte at Marengo. I love playing it PBEM (I think I maybe prefer playing it that way). Because of the nature of the different types of units (and there are only 3) I get a real tension not knowing what is blocking an enemy approach.
What I'm most looking forward to from Napoleon's Triumph is the addition of more players and the extra level added to the combat (increased tension I hope).

Simply awesome.  Playing this game is like getting punched in the ear, except you kinda like it later after the throbbing subsides.

I'm not hugely into the deterministic combat, but the way that Napoleonic tactics and maneuver and abstractly modeled by the various systems is nothing short of superb.  And the victory conditions are the epitome of how to model a very difficult situation in terms of the players knowing too much about how things turned out.

RATING: 7.5
This a tentative score. I received it some days ago and had only one play. This is really special, very immersive, the board is big and the desing is awesone. The difficulty stays in the combat rules. But since everything makes sense, I have no doubt that it will become very natural quite soon. I like it!
FUN ★★★★✰
The board is huge, the pieces are simple but when they are all set on the map, they are very convienent to use. It looks that depending on the choices of the opponent, there are various ways of playing and winning. This game is tremendous. I regret that it's very difficult to make the commandants stickers stick on the metal bars, but I'll find a way to solve this.

RULES ★★★✰✰
They are short. Extremely well written but d-e-n-s-e. I'd like to have received some player aids, summaries, just to make sure that we don't miss something, because even though each detail in the rules make totally sense, it's easy to forget something, even more if you don't play very often. By chance, there are many of these aids to download in BGG. I prefer when rules writers extend the explanation a bit more to make sure every type of gamer can have a grasp on them (and not analyse every single word).

IMMERSION ★★★★★
It's probably the strongest aspect of this game. The design and size of the map, the colored bars of the forces, the fact that forces are hidden (block-type), how the game is played in terms of rules, all this give a real impression that you re-do this battle and there are ways to setup good strategies.

DEPTH ★★★★✰
I'm sure that I'll play it very often with the same pleasure. But it will be always the same batttle on the same map, with only one opponent. Therefore, I can image the replayability won't be very high. But we'll see...

A little too deep for me right now, but I'd love to play this game more and be overwhelmed by the options again. Not too hard to learn, but so hard to play. Carefully pick battles you can win, as the consequences are brutal. Decide between entrenching yourself in defense or being flexible. Flank the enemy. Park your artillery quickly in strategic positions. So few actions, yet so much to do...

Downsides: the map is a little overwhelming to take in, and the symbols can be hard to see. Wish locales can be double-lined or highlighted in some other way, so it's easier to see approaches vs. reserve. The map definitely seems to emphasize minimalist beauty over functionality. The perform X-actions format is just asking for AP, causing a lot of downtime between turns. It's a shame because I'd love to ponder my move more, since the ramifications of a bad deployment, unit mix or wrong attacking threat are huge, but I often have to settle for something hasty to avoid taking too long (hopefully this will improve). And the game is horribly confusing on your first play, because of a ton of nitpicky exceptions, and because the rules are unlike anything you've seen before..

I will apply HiveGod's HIS comment here. This is the only game that applies for me.
[q="HiveGod"]I've only gotten to play a measly one game so far, but that's more than enough to make this one of my all time favorites.

This is a polarising game. You'll either love it for its abstraction of manoeuvre and fog of war, or hate it for its (lack of) historicity and abstraction. The fog of war portion makes little sense with artillery, there are no infantry squares, and no assault columns, which are some of the very things which define a Napoleonic Era battle.

The rules are convoluted and written very poorly, resulting in frequent rules referencing, even though there's just a few pages of rules. I'd rather play a hex-and-counter Napoleonics game than this, or indeed any other game.

Currently amazed and in awe of the game designer. My friend who played this with me is former US military intelligence and commented that this was the first game that actually requires one to analyse like a military commander taking into account METT-T and CCCI. In fact, the game requires you to have an overall strategy before you place your pieces.

My only criticism would be that the rules, as laid out, are somewhat hard to remember and sometimes to understand. You will have to play this game at least 3-4 times before you "get it."

I haven't played it yet, the rating is based purely on the rules I just read, aesthetics, production quality and the overall impression I have from the game so far- seems to be really serious stuff. I strongly suspect that there is something special for me here. 

UPDATE> Played my first two games yesterday. This is something pretty exceptional and it can get no less than a 10 if you ask me.

UPDATE> When I rediscovered boardgames, exactly such a game I was hoping to find. Can't get better that that, only equally good. Let's hope that other designers see the huge potential here and produce games in the same format. This is a work of art and it's on a league of its own.

[BGCOLOR=#FF3300][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Wargame.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Block. The follow-up to Bonaparte at Marengo, with more emphasis on battle and a little less on maneuver (or so I've heard). Looking forward to playing it!

Update: finally played it! Great wargame, our minds were fried after slugging it out from 0700 to 1300 on the 2 December scenario. We both made mistakes, partially in the rules and partially bad decisions. The combat/movement feels rather different from Bonaparte at Marengo, despite being based on the same system. Where maneuver was king in BaM, there is a little less emphasis on it here, though it can still be used to turn the tide of battle. The revised combat system is at once both complicated and yet a simplified, unified system for handling all types of attack: maneuver (now called feints), bombardment and assault.

Looking forward to the next play!

Finally traded this to McWookie for C&C Ancients, in anticipation of getting Guns of Gettysburg (Wook is a Napoleonics freak, I still have access to play it, and I'm just dyin' to get my hands on GoG).

Még kezdő vagyok a wargame-k területén, de eddig ez volt közülük, ami legkevésbé tetszett. De kezdjük először a pozitívumokkal. Gyönyörű, részletes tábla, nagyon jó játékelemek, bár nekem kicsik voltak, nehezen átlátható a sok blokkból álló egység. Mivel a csata viszonylag kis területen zajlott, ezért nagyon részletgazdag a tábla, mint egy turistatérkép. Érdekes az egyes területrészek megoldása is. Vagy egy vagy két blokk fér el egy-egy terület oldalán, ami többféle alakzat is lehet, 3 oldalútól, akár 8 oldalú síkidomig is. Az egyes oldalak jól kidolgozottak abban a tekintetben is, hogy milyen egység szenved rajtuk esetleg hátrányt a támadás során vagy átjárhatatlan-e a terület. A csata 1 vagy 2 napot ölel fel. Játék végi feltétel a 0-ra csökkent morál vagy adott számú kör lejátszása. A morál kérdése szerintem nagyon logikus. A csatavesztő fél veszít, a veszteséggel megegyezőt. Negatívumok. A szabály szerintem nem túl jól épül fel és láttam már könnyebben érthetőt is. A területi átjárások értelmezése se könnyű. A támadást nagyon meg kell fontolni, mert az ellenség ellentámadása miatt nagyon kevés az esély a győzelemre, ezért csak bekerítés után látni értelmét. Emiatt maga a játékmenet lehet lapos. Meneküléssel, akár állandó üldözésbe is torkollhat a játszma, ami kicsit furcsa. Szóval valahogy a játékmenet nem tetszett. Biztosan hozzájárult ehhez a tapasztalatlanságunk is, de mivel nemrég próbáltam a Sekigaharát, ami számomra ennél sokkal gördülékenyebb, egyszerűbb mégis szerintem semmivel sem ad kevesebb élményt, ezért muszáj ezt kicsit lepontoznom. Ettől függetlenül el kell ismernem, hogy nagyon egyedi, ugyanis nincs kocka benne, emiatt nincs is szerencse. A setup nagyrészt a két félen múlik, ezért lehetne változatos egy-egy csata, de mégis azt éreztem vannak kulcspontok, amit minden csatában meg kell védeni vagy figyelni rá. Ha később találkozom ezzel a játékkal lehet jobb élmény lett volna, de így elsőre egy 5-öst adnék.

Sort of a grand-tactical weuro, based on Stratego-like mechanics (very much on steroids). Not sure how representative of the thin red line this is, but certainly it makes for a well accomplished and very interesting game. I found the rules, presented in a procedural, step by step format with plenty of fiddly cases and exceptions, extremely dense and hard to digest, given their relative simplicity. I rarely have this kind of problem and strongly believe they could be conveyed in a more accessible fashion (at least, more accessible to me).

Epic, but more importantly, unique.  This game is different, which makes it intriguing once you learn it but challenging until then, if that scares you just move along to a stock hex and counter CRT game.  BGG is an asset, you'll get your questions answered quickly, but this is a bicycle you are just going to have to fall over and skin your knee on.

I hope Guns of Gettysburg is a little more streamlined in this regard.

[COLOR=#CC0033][b]No other board-game immerses me into the Napoleonic experience like this one. I really feel like a battlefield commander when playing this game and the tension never lets up.  There are some smart wargames on the market but for me, this is a cut above everything else.  Extremely elegant and streamlined, yet so very deep.  No two games are the same despite the fact that you are refighting the same battle.  It really takes a few plays, hopefully with an experienced player, to fully appreciate what a masterpiece this is.

NT is a big game that plays quickly and is highly entertaining. Both sides face difficult choices, and both will have the opportunity to go on the offensive. When you make your move, though, you need to finish it, because falling short can leave you open to devastating counter attacks. NT is a tremendous challenge to play well, and will remain as a personal favorite for me for the foreseeable future.

Excellent fog of war game with many innovative features. The components are of the highest quality and the mapboard is huge. Rules are concise and it's surprising how much depth a game of this nature can posses with such a brief set of rules (other wargame designers take note). Terrain effects on movement are very well done and the victory conditions determined by decreases in morale from units' defeats is both original and convincing. I have a couple of quibbles about combat outcomes, particularly that a large group of units always detach from each other if defeated, which is something that will take several turns to rectify. This is such a tense cat and mouse game with so many positives about the way it plays that any minor criticisms can easily be overlooked.

Outstanding block game, relatively short playtime. Amazingly well thought out (and different) design. Lovely board (could be framed on the wall!), high quality components. Only caveat is that it is hard to grasp the strategy from the otherwise clear and concise rulebook. If I could only own one game I would think long and hard about this being it.

RATING: 9
The King of block-style tactical wargames, and a design that is worthy of study.  Lots of uncertainty (i.e. in simulating fog of war in battle), but no explicitly randomized luck element.  It's not unlike perfect information games, where all the info. you need is on the board and in the spatial configuration of the pieces.  There is strategy to be developed, but it is of a general and diffuse nature; this puts the game a little closer to chess than I would have it be, given my 'druthers, but nevertheless an amazing design that, for me, brings an otherwise medium-interest historical battle to vibrant life.

The rulebook is brutal. This one took about three solid games and a few hours with the rules to "get", but now that I do, I'm impressed. The gameplay is tense. Tactics matter, but it's highly strategic. It also captures the historical flow of the battle. Most importantly, it's the type of game that when I first played it, even though I didn't entirely grasp the gameplay, made me want to keep at it until I did.

I cannot rate it yet. I just had one go so far and it was my first overall experience with wargames. And this experience was just too overwhelming to make a decision on how fun it was, since this game differs so much from anything else I played my brain was burning big time. It's very fiddly and confusing for a first-timer I really don't want to know how many rules we got wrong or how amateurish I must have played. I fled into victory and really - fleeing was my key to success, which makes me feel a little unsatisfied about the victory. Played with the French and didn't call for the reinforcements, breached the flanks and from that time on tried to flee and not run out of morale.

RATING: 10
When I saw this game the first time, I knew I had to own it and desperately wanted to play it. The look and feel, the pure elegance of design... just... wow!

The components feel so, for lack of a better word, sophisticated. The fact this game recreates the aesthetic feel of being a general standing around a map on a table with your officers working through your battle plan is astounding. When I play this, I feel like I'm doing something mature, cerebral, and almost academic. But not at all some hobbyist in a garage stacking up cardboard chits or a kid in the basement painting toy soldiers and rolling dice to add excitement to his pretend play. This feels like working through a model. 

Those who say it's "not a simulation" are perhaps not seeing that this game is able to reproduce a richness of tactical and strategic decision-making and the kind of maneuvering that define Napoleonic warfare. It does this in a way that no game I've yet come across can and it does it with so much less fuss than so many rule-laden wargames, where there is just such a myopia on specific combat aspects. By abstracting all of those details and reducing combat down to its essence, Simmons is able to account for all the major features of that combat, without rolling buckets of dice, having lots of tables, or having a drawn out battle resolution process. But the rules that are there are so important, deceptively, so, and have far-reaching implications that must really be witnessed to be appreciated. The way a large corps of 8 full-strength units still has the same attack surface as single detachment defending an approach, and that can lead to an attack being repulsed, the corps being shattered, and all of the surviving units being crippled--disorganized and broken--waiting like sitting ducks... that's something special. 

I also just love the terrain system of locales. This is area movement, but with more. It is abstracted, yes, but so is applying a tessellated hex grid to a real-world map. But Simmons' system, improved upon from Boneparte at Morengo, takes lots of real -world data and boils that down in simple ways. The size of a locale, the size of the approaches between locales, approach bonuses/features, capacity limits, road placements... it is all so intuitive. It feels right.

The design clearly takes inspiration from block wargames, but this is not a typical block wargame in any sense. No dice, no rotating blocks, no initiative, etc. 

Yes, combat is deterministic, except it doesn't feel that way because of all the uncertainty and the many unknowns due to both fog of war and the subtleties of the combat system. The procedural order of the attack sequence forces players to commit to choices without knowing the outcomes, and bluff and a kind of chance figure into that. This allows many options and lots of excitement and tension, without multiple rounds of dice and hit tallies.

A masterpiece. Pure and simple.

Works great as a game, extremely beautiful in a minimalist way and very tense in play - bluff and balance.

RATING: 8
One play.  Its neat.  I really love how the game allows you to manipulate your opponents into unfavorable positions with the varying attack widths, feints, and multiple fronts.  I really really hate how my opponent can do the same to me, hahaha.  The oft maligned rulebook is actually very good.  The answer to all over your questions are contained inside in a clear and concise manner, and eliminating any possible loopholes so far(which is the primary job of any rulebook).  The game system, however, is quite unique and it does take a bit to wrap your brain around it.  One play, hardly an expert, but I am a fan.  It will take me a few more, to have a more intelligent comment in this field.  Soon I hope.  

It really strikes me as a game where one must outthink their opponent instead of out managing the system.  That is a big plus.

I really learned so much from the reading of the rules and finishing my first game.  I really can't wait for the next game.

Wow. I mean what to say about this game. It's a huge game. I don't exactly mean the physical size of it but the goings on in it. Yet it's so simple. A war game for sure but it all seemed very intuitive to me. I really enjoyed my first game and look forward to more plays. 

UPDATE: It's probably going to be considered unfair but I have updated (meaning lowered) my rating on this game. Why? Because I now own Sekigahara and I know they have a lot of differences but they have some similarities as well. I like the latter so much more.

I found this more difficult to learn than Guns of Gettysburg and I came this close to giving up on it during my first game.  During the second and third games it became much easier, almost intuitive.  It is a beautiful game on display - the blocks and mapboard augment the fun and playability.  The play is enjoyable and exciting.  I like the decision of planning your initial strategy and disposition.  I like the uncertainty in the opening phases. I like the breakup of the Corps as the game progresses and the growing difficulty of control and the agonizing over which units simply must be moved.  I find the victory conditions good, and the trade-off of reinforcement vs shifted victory conditions yet another compelling and sometimes difficult mid- to late-game decision.  I can not play this game enough.

Probably my favorite game.  The system just comes together so well to create a grand, sweeping battle of maneuver.  The single best design feature is definitely the French reinforcement decision, which forces the Allies to attack while still keeping an eye on the possibility that they may end up on the defensive.  Keeping at least one powerful corps in reserve is essential to countering enemy threats.

Unbelievably brilliant.

One play only sofar, so this is a tentative rating. Played 2 vs 2, and found that it undoubtedly is a very original wargame. In some ways, it feels like the winner is determined by choreography: It is not so much a matter of concentrating your forces, but how you manoeuvre them. Feinting, flanking and surrounding is paramount to success. Although this part of the (beautiful looking!) is very appealing, be prepared to invest a great deal of effort to find out how to win. The first couple of games are probably more of a learning game than anything else. Not for casual gamers!!

Update after 6th play: fighting the rules, again. But bit by bit we managed to understand the attack/defense sequence. In two weeks we hope to play a full battle.

Update after 5th play, 4 years later: the board with all pieces is still stunning, but going through that rulebook again felt like punishment. This game is in serious need of streamlined rules, or at least a decent player aid.

Rating after four plays.
Most beautiful game, ever! 
But the rulesbook... it's a mess. No index, and while the rules aren't [i]that[/i] complex they sure seem to be.

Recently, I was asked how I would rate Napoleon's Triumph to BaM...

At this point, I would rate the two as separate species, within the same genus.  The ideas, the look, and the concepts have some overlap, and then you begin to play NT...the world slips away the sun burns off, a second one appears, somewhere, where? behind you, and you sink into one thousand dreams of somersaulting visions that captivate and reinvigorate you as they introduce you to someone you knew once, who was you, and you wonder when, you wonder why, you wonder, then begin to understand...the game you are playing is nothing like, and everything like BaM.  

This is Crack to Weed, MLB to Little League, Kasparov to Bobby Trent.  Once you begin to play you realize that there is a lot more to the game, and you best not go into it lightly...your life may be consumed, and you may change your name to Napoleon before the season changes.

Be careful.  You just might like it.

Solid game, just like its forebear, [gameid=15839].  Base system is still there, and you're constantly surveying your own units, trying to find where you can maneuver, where you can assault outright, and where you better run away quickly so that you can regroup somewhere else.  This series is really amazing at making maneuver as important or more as just outright strength.  Just like Bonaparte at Marengo, you can be outgunned, but if you're in a better position, you can lock the other player down really easily.  So how does this differ from the earlier entry in the series?  Well, this one is bigger and more complex.  Not only do you have more units, there's even a bigger board.  The addition of leaders to form corps which are commanded more easily means you have a lot more decisions.  This game does have a different feel than BaM.  Where BaM makes the French player desperately hold on while the Austrian throws troops at them, this game forces both sides to attack and defend.

This masterpiece of board game design delivers on its promise of conveying an epic battlefield experience in a short playing time (2-3 hrs). Dramatically better than Bonaparte at Marengo; I really love the addition of corps as they evoke the two-tier feel of overseeing the whole battle and then zooming in to smaller fronts. It's everything I could want a war game to be. Unlike your typical war game the rules here are elegant and concise, but their implications can be difficult to wrap your head around and thus there is a relatively steep learning curve. Well worth the investment though.

The rules are a steep learning curve but once mastered Napoleon's Triumph is a joy to play. In comparison with Bonaparte at Marengo, Napoleon's Triumph feels much more free and open but also more dangerous and edgy. To use the analogy of others; its less chess and more poker.

Love the block system.  This game expands on the BaM system of play.  The components are great with a hugh mounted map (on thick cardboard) and metal clips for the leaders not to mention the hundreds of wooden blocks for the units.  The game system allows for the maneuvers of the original battle and the two scenarios allow for playing either the historical setup or a version where units can enter over two days allowing for abundant variation to the game.

This is what good wargames were suppose to be like. Before this, wargames never felt right to me: most of them recreate the bells and whistles of war rather than reproduce the tactics and situations.

This game is the hardest I have had to teach someone, mostly because you have to know how the whole system works to really be able to do what you plan.  However, once the rules are learned, this is a really intense game.  It is one of the only games I have played where both sides feel like they are losing the whole game.  Twilight Struggle has a similar feel.

People rave about the map. I don't understand that. I find it has a washed-out look that is boring, drab, and dull. Areas often lack terrain features to show why there are terrain penalties; it would be nice if terrain was shown on the map in more detail and with a splash more colour.

This is probably at the high end of the better wargames that I own. I love the tension involved in deciding where to employ my troops. Where to attack. Where my opponent is at his weakest. The only problem I have with the game so far is that the rules intimidate me. It's a game that needs to be played many times so that you can become fluent in what you are doing. I know when I play that many games this game will easily be a 10 in my book.

RATING: 9
I love the innovative mechanics in Napoleon's Triumph: corps and unit commands, approaches and locales, and changing win conditions.

Is the game "fun"?  Sometimes. Maybe. I'm not sure.  But it is extremely satisfying.  And short - three hours or less, typically.

The only drawback is that NT is tough even for experienced wargamers to learn - precisely because its system is so novel.  Plus, the game IS a wargame; there are lots of niggling rules and exceptions to figure out.  The player aids are worth their weight in gold - especially the attack summary - and it helps that most of the combat/movement exceptions make conceptual sense.

To be honest, this game isn't for casual gamers, strict Eurogamers, dice-loving wargamers, or people who don't have the free time to digest the details of a neat, yet fairly involved game system.  But if you have the time and the inclination, it's absolutely worth the effort to learn.  Simply put, this is a great game.

An intricate and amazing design, and a beautiful sight. The feeling of slow-wheeling lines of confrontation creates memorable moments as you puzzle out various tactical decisions and strategic moves.

The many little quirks and restrictions are a pain to absorb though, not helped at all by a badly organized rulebook. Key rules are buried in the middle of paragraphs at the end of long sections. Cavalry exceptions? You'll have to find them spread throughout like Easter eggs. Don't forget the artillery hill rule, hidden like a holy grail in the middle of nowhere.

This means that, two games in, and much mental effort, I'm only just starting to fully absorb all the implications of those exceptions and restrictions. Looking forward to the big picture maneuvering in following games... There's no doubt even from the beginning though that this is a fascinating achievement, a unique design.

UPDATE: With the rules now firmly in my head, this game is a masterpiece.

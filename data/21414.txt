Decepcionante tras una sesión de 5 horas.
Las cartas de evento son bonitas pero muy repetitivas y aportan muy poco chrome y sabor al juego, además propiciando una gestión de mano nula.
Demasiadas tiradas de dado (¡¡¡) con combates muy repetitivos y cansinos.
Estrategias muy obvias, con poca alternativa y variación en ellas.
Manual con algunas lagunas y engorroso de consultar durante la partida.
Cuando uno lleva un rato jugando ya todo le parece lo mismo por lo repetitivo del sistema. 

Lo considero un wargame de iniciación muy simple y se hace bastante pesado. Poco reto para avezados grognards. 

De nada sirve una gran belleza de componentes si el juego que hay detrás es tan pobre.

I wanted to like this game. After 3 sessions, it didn't work for me.

Production is impressive, components quality is top notch, the art direction feel is right for the period without hurting functionality too much.

It is inexcusable though that there are counters and cards typos or errors. Really, at that price? Inexcusable that my buddy had to mark up his cards and some counters in ink. Rules is one thing, but cards?

Play wise, I was looking forward to the simplicity. I was disappointed.

1) The "bucket of dice" combat resolution method is a pain. As the game progresses when there are multiple types of units with different fire ratings involved, it is a bit tedious. Looking for "1"s on d6 can give extreme results which I find hard to believe at that scale. To use the alternate methods proposed (d12 or averaged out results) did not seem to be a right fix. I can't see myself throwing 15d12 or simply counting up lost steps systematically. The CRT could have been more traditional but well crafted, it doesn't have to be complex, but combat resolution IS the heart of the design, might as well be innovative.

2) This is really an economic game. You manage Build Points which are converted into cards and units. That's all you do. Sure you need some kind of balance to fit your style and strategy, but once you have figured it out and understood the ROI of each element in the inventory, decisions are minimal and choices pretty obvious. You shift units between Armies and decide to burn cards or units.

3) There's plenty of room for retreat so it doesn't really matters when holes appear in your line, you know you will plug them up on next turn by shifting units. VP areas being mostly on the border, there are limited options for maneuver, an advance will eventually be cut, no way flanks can hold for long.

4) 2 + 3 above makes it for a somewhat boring game, unfortunately. It's repetitious and frustrating. You might argue that this is WWI after all but I ask where's the game?

5) There are a lot of rules options, historical variants etc. This is good one hand but on the other, I wonder if the game was meant to be played barebones or not. Given the low complexity, I would have avoided optional and "advanced" rules.

Anyway. Not sure I liked the generic units and the attritive design. I felt like an accountant. May be cute to look at and simple enough to play while sipping beer and eating pretzels, but in my opinion, the fun of the session will remain with the latter two.

After reading the rules and doing some research, I was really excited for this one. But I don’t think it really works, despite bringing a bunch of good ideas. The opening (1914) and end of the war (1917-19) seems to work reasonably well, although there are no reasonable standalone scenarios for those times. But the middle years are just a mess. Neither player really has any incentive to do any of the historical offensives since the defense is so strong. The balance on a lot of the cards seems somewhat suspect (the poison gas cards are particularly suspect since they are likely to cause less damage to the opponent than they cost to play, particularly for the French who seem to have a suspicious lack of artillery counters). Since VPs are only counted at the end and largely determined in the opening offensive, it just seems to get a bit silly.if the Germans can do slightly better than they did historically, they can just entrench and never attack again until they get the Stoss in 1917.

WWI is a hard problem, but I’m not sure it’s s hard as this and Field of Despair have made it look. Fields of Despair got a lot right but then fell apart on its sketchy Combat resolution system. To The Last Man has a nice structure but the players just aren’t motivated to actually do anything for most of the war in a way that would make the game interesting. Fields of Despair had a telescoping time scale which didn’t totally work, but at least made the mid-war years less boring.

It is a strange dynamic: The line seems static, but the strengths and weaknesses on both sides of the line - and the resulting tensions - evolve. Like a seemingly placid body of water with a vicious current.

What struck me about this game was how much it rewards finding weakness and attacking it - quickly and repeatedly - with overwhelming strength. And all the while making sure that the enemy isn't doing the same to you.

An initial 7 rating with room to grow or decline. I suspect growth if I can figure out how to really create breakthroughs.

A very nice design. Simple rules mean that you can get down to the strategy quickly. Tough decisions - and that was with the armies visible to both sides so it was mainly in the production phase & whether or not to launch & offensive or pass during a turn. I've got to play this again with hidden armies. Kudos to the graphic artists too - looks a treat. I can't believe that this didn't make it to publication. No matter - Richard did the hard work printing & sticking. I just got to enjoy a super game.

RATING: 7
A straightforward, accessible treatment of the whole of the Western Front in WWI. It's very playable but is very dice dependent, on first play, I think to the extent that good rolling will overwhelm good play. I would have liked a more elegant/cleverer combat mechanic. Add to that the luck of the card draw.

The map is a little too restrained and there are a couple of other production negatives in my opinion - 

- French and German units are too similar in colour.
- There should be some control counters.
- Some markers to help keep track of hits, and types of hits during combat would be useful.
- Player shields.

It would be interesting to give it amother play from 1914 start rather than the 1918 scenario I played.

RATING: 9
The map, counters, game cards and rulebook all have fine artwork and are made by deluxe materials. Rules are easy and straightforward. Optional rules and variant plans add a lot of flavor into scenarios and the campaign game. 

One infantry counter represents 2 to 6+ infantry divisions. The loss of a single counter does matter during play and gives up a hint of the horrific casualties being inflicted in the course of WWI. So, a mistake or a push of your armies a little more just because one thinks victory is at his grasp can have serious implications on his strategy. Game play runs smooth and gives an example of how strategy and in a lesser amount tactics worked out a century ago. WWI fans will not be disappointed having this wargame into their collection.

RATING: 9
Couple of plays. First a quick win as the Germans reaching a Decisive Victory in 1916. Then a slow and desperate struggle as the Entente lasting into mid-1918 when my opponent surrendered and gave me a Marginal Entente Victory. 

I really like how the game provides Fog of War. The ability to move units along your front without the opponent knowing, the knowledge that your opponent must have some weaker points in his line that might be worth you attacking, and the need to balance spending on cards and building units provide plenty of interesting decisions even when you are defending an essentially static front through much of the game.

Interesting game, have only played a couple of times as of yet. Somehow, unconsciously it gives rise to thoughts like: 'If I can just break their damn line everything will fall'. And you just keep cramming men into the meatgrinder, again and again in the thousands, hoping to get a break.
So yeah, sounds like the real deal.

This is not just game. It is more of a toolbox that permits you to play the Western Front of the world war one in any way you want. Great mod-ability, a good basic engine, and a massive mount of options. A game with decisions that make you think, and a good balance between friction and planning. 

There are some issues: Not really a multiplayer game. I wish it had something like the Strike of the Eagle system for multiplayer. Second, sometimes the dice can be too decisive. 

A good game, but even more and outstanding toolbox.

[b]Definitely[/b] use the Hidden Units and Bidding for the Initiative optional rules.

Fun game.  The burrito boy, age 9, loves this game because he crushed me the second time we played.  This has the same tough choices and fine line between victory & total disaster as Rommel in the Desert or EastFront, but at a fraction of the mechanical complexity.  (For example, during buildup, you've got 6-8 points to spend, and everything costs one point.)  This means you can focus on the decisions, not the accounting.  And once things start falling apart, every turn you're faced with simple choices which will lose you the game if you choose poorly.

I rated this an 8 for a long time because of concerns about replayability, and because I feel the rulebook could be rewritten to be a lot shorter (more on this below).  (Err, and because of some rough interactions between some of the optional rules.)  But after 15 plays in 9 months, I don't care; I'm raising it to a 10.  Although it's been a while since I've played this, I didn't burn out on it, or even play every scenario; I just had a bunch of other games on the shelf which needed to be played to justify their purchase!

[b]Publishers![/b]  Someone other than Compass pick this up!  My copy looks super-awesome--my map is framed, and my units are on thick mat-board--but I would still buy a published copy.  And the cards have the best graphic design of any game [i]ever.[/i]  Including Busen Memo.

UPDATE: this bit was rendered invalid by the new shorter rulebook. [-]My one complaint is that I think the rulebook is longer than it needs to be because some things are repeated (and because there are references to a sister game for the eastern front); I've fiddled with paring it down to the style I prefer, but haven't finished.  (And there's [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/424987]one rule[/url] I don't care for, but it's trivial to leave it out.)[/-]  My point is that you shouldn't let the size of the rulebook scare you off; it's really simple to learn & play.

Love this game and I have to disagree with some comments.

Of cause this game is not has spectacular has other. The topic is WW1 , West Front where almost nothing happened during the 4 long years of that war.

1-Some complain because we have to roll a lots of dies. So what ? We also don’t have to calculated all the combats on the tables. For me it’s equivalent and the hazard is the same. Luck is luck both ways. 

2-This is an economic and military game. You really feel like you are in charge of your side. You have to decide where is your priorities: 
Prepare offensives. Strategic re-deployments. Building new troupes. What type of troupes. Tanks, planes, guns, etc. Attack. 

3- If you retreat, you lose victory positions and the victory points who came with.

4-how could you be bore if you have always something to decided ? It’s a cards driven game with reactions all the time.

5- You don't have to play most of all the optional rules.

My cavalry could raid inside your line just IF you neglect to close a gap on your front line. 

Finally, it is a simulation of this historical attrition war. I find it’s very realistic, historical, easy and fun to play.
I don’t care if it have a few mistakes in some playing cards. (1917 instead of 1915 on 6 or 7 cards + 3 counters with a useless back side). It is one of the most beautiful game I ever saw. 
I understand this topic is not for everyone but I like it a lot and I am ready to play it again with a good challenger. 
Of cause I have more spectacular games in my collection but this one really have something to offer to someone who take the time it need to appreciate it subtlety.

play 4 time.

TTLM! just didn't work for me. With all the 1914 special rules and the one-sided start, I was pretty nonplussed by the design. The game seemed like it was going to be light, fun, and accessible, but play felt slow and arduous, especially as the Entente player. For me, the design needed further streamlining, or more chrome. And in a war game, not to mention one about WW1, I want to see the bodies pile up. Discarding a card to avoid taking a hit is an abstraction too far for me. The shadow of PoG looms large over this game, even though the designer was quite brave in trying to be innovative and unique (and here he succeeded.)

The cards are beautiful and wonderfully designed. The map and pieces, however are scandalously difficult to read and un-intuitive.

French game on the Western Front 1914-19 with areas and armies which can each hold infantry, cavalry, artillery, aricraft and tank assets to reflect their strength. In part it is a game of bluff as assets can be moved from army to army with only the army counter on the board. Cards are used for special abilities or to absorb casualties, so that even a weak army can hold off an offensive. In the end the arrival of the Americans and tanks in 1918-19 will defeat the Germans, but they have a chance of winning earlier if they can gind down the French. There are many, many variants in the initial 1914 set up and optional rules based on teh French and German pre-war plans.

RATING: 6
May not be final rating.

At first sight a fine simulation of WWI. The game system is such that it both simulates the movement and the static phases of the war without adding special 'stalemate' or 'movement' rules. Impressive.

First and 2nd turn are some fun, and that's pretty good: you don't need to wait until mid-game to enjoy yourself.

Yet I suspect playtesting has not explored all the possibilities the rules offer, esp. the '1 division stops a 10 times stronger army' workaround. This makes the game very far from any simulation.

I have read that "every BP" counts. I have seen quite the opposite, with both sides getting to the bottom of their force pools by 1916. Pretty much, you gain more BPs than what you lose fighting, leading to armies built to their maximum, and little more play than that.

Combat system based on rolling tons of dice is dull , but leads to not-that-usual game mechanics:
- the speedbump trick described above
- hoping to be very lucky on a combat to kill all your opponents. After 2-3 turns, this becomes the main tactics

[the maths: with 3 full German armies (15 div + 5 art = 25 rolls), and poison gas, you get an average 5.8 hits. This is not enough to kill an oponent with 2 armies (and say 3+4=7 units), not to mention ersatz cards. What you then hope is to have rolls far beyond your average, and manage about 12 hits, to really kill that enemy stack. When that arrives, no surprise your oponent claims it's pure luck - it is. ]

On material: great at first sight. Really fine quality, beautiful rules. A couple of misaps: 
- 'not-as-clear-as-it-should-be' map
- award of the least intelligent graphics for the French/British divisions: either red-white-blue circles or blue-white-red circles. Players keep confusing them (no one could have guessed!)

Surprisingly, feels a lot like a Columbia block game. The cardplay is very clever, as playing ersatz cards to cancel losses means you can hold the line almost anywhere you want, but you can't hold everywhere. 

In 1914 the Germans have lot more flexibility and can sustain offensives after the Entente have tapped out. Which feels right. I can see that maintaining a line and carefully allocating replacements, along with desperate rail moves and misdirection, will be key. 

For such a handsome and well thought out production, the lack of control markers is irksome.

Had my eyes on this game for a year or so, then finally got around to printing the map and counters (spend a small fortune. Probably end up paying more for the PnP version than what the published version costs). 

Second play and the system is starting to grow on me. From an objective onlooker, not a lot seems to be going on on the map, but behind the static frontlines, a lot of frantic moving troops back and forth, plugging holes and gathering forces for offensives is going on. The game really does an excellent job of simulating the static front while confronting you with tough historical, logistical choices.

The game is all about knowing when to strike and when to consolidate and build up your forces for the next season. Simple, yet tense. Every die roll counts, every unit lost is gravely felt.

Rules are not very clear though. Optional rules from first set was incorporated as standard in a second, shorter version. But vital information is not included in the new version. As of now, you have to confer with two - slightly different - rules sets.

I hope the upcoming published version will have rules that are better written. So far we looked up a lot of rules on the geek and elsewhere. And questions keep popping up. A game this simple should not - contrary to what the designer may think and argue - take up this much rules space.

Excellent support here on the geek, with the designer responding personally to your queries.

Awesome game for anyone contemplating starting in wargames and for grognards too! I really like that the CDG mechanic doesn't undermine this wargame. It's CDG enhanced, not CDG driven.

Seems like an excellent game, but requires F2F play due to army building mechanism, so up for trade due to a lack of willing foe.

Traded away. Shame.

NUTS! Publishing version. Very nice components.  The game speaks for itself.

I won’t rate the game : it would probably sound biased. I have been involved in the project since I offered Tim my help to design the map & cards when it appeared that his design didn't get the support it deserved from publishers. Strangely, because the game hits a sweet spot: accessible to a large audience without being simplistic, fast playing, excellent replayability factor (lots of scenarios...). I bought a lot of wargames all these years, some of them proved to be excellent. But I’m not sure any of them provided the same level of fun.

Only played once but the game looks very promising and I am looking forward to playing it again. Also map and card design are both beautiful to look at and easy to play with.

The depth of this game is in the scoring system and, in particular, building you ships to suit your Government contracts which, for me, turns the game from a tactical one into a strategic one. Two reservations. 1) It's just a little long for us to fit it comfortably into our 3hr game night. 2) It's a bit multi-player solitaire.

LIKE: The multiple rondels were interesting. Fun to build boats. Interesting combos.
DISLIKE: Felt a little multi-player solitaire, but there was occasional inadvertent blocking, so therefore not mush tension. Dry game. Fiddly, lots of little pieces and icons. Setup took a while.

OVERALL: A medium weight game with spurts of scoring. First play was difficult to scope the game out since the other players did not quite grasp the game until a round in. Nonetheless they enjoyed it, but setup time was an issue. May be a game that grows with time.

A Gamer's Game for sure.  It is very involved and very long-winded.  The process of getting your ship out onto its trials is arduous and a lot needs to be considered.  you haven't always got every option as someone else may have beaten you to it.  There are a series of rondels that feel like your inside a giant piece of clockwork.  Yet, the theme does seem to hold quite well despite the complexity.  You do feel like you've built a boat and I do like anything with a maritime theme!  I wouldn't say that there wa s a lot of interaction and it's one of those where it's hovering somewhere on the border of "is this too much to be fun?"  As it is, I think, for most gamers it stays on the right side of the fence...the breed of gamer that only likes massively heavy games and dismisses everything else as rubbish are on a different planet anyway - they would probably want this to have yet more complexity.

I like the dials to some extent but maybe its too many things that keep changing. I didn't like the contract cards as they force my strategy too much and often make each player go in different directions which are all feasible, there's not much i can do to interfere with other players as I have no idea what is worthwhile for them so a bit too multiplayer solitaire.

It seems you mess with other players through luck rather than anything else.

Played this at Essen '09 and bought it. It's a demanding game where players build up ships by collecting ship parts (sails, sailors, captain, guns, soldiers etc), each of which triggers points once the ship is built, provided that the ship sails succesfully on it's maiden test voyage through the appropriate 'point triggering areas' in the canals which are available to purchase. Interesting mechanisms include the fact that resources collected from train cards may be exchanged for one of several ship parts or money (which is tight) BUT these parts may alos be obtained on one of two rondels; the action selection is a track on which are placed a number of different cards representing different actions; an action just used by one player movces to the front of this track and the actions further back pay out cash if selected (like unused actions in Puerto Rico); the game plays thru in a fixed number of actions counted by the track (but different for different number of players). 

Lots of choice, lots to think about, not oo much interaction on a turn by turn basis but competition for the best actions. Another interesting idea?: an additional action can be bought for significant mnoney but this allows you to use an action selected nby another player.

Theme fits well. Nice

Very nice medium-heavy eurogame about building ships. Nice mechanics. The game includes 5 different rondels. It might look intimidating at first because of the many components but it is simpler than you think. In your turn you just pick one of the 8 available actions (actually you can only choose from 4 because the others will be blocked) to do, then you might collect income and finally you have the option to pay 6 coins for a bonus actions. It’s simple. Right? The game offers many choices because with each of your actions you pick something from the board and you have so many things to choose from. The interaction level is a bit low as you can’t actually hurt your opponents too much. You can just limit their income by selecting actions that are behind in the rondel. Also the 4 small rondels have 1 action marker on them which is moved by every player, so you can potentially make some options expensive for the others. The game comes with contract tiles which are kept hidden and give you extra VP at the end of the game. Minor issue: the game has big setup and clean-up time. Keep in mind that in takes about 40 minutes per player.

Gran juego de construcción de barcos. Explota la mecánica del rondel (hay 4).Hay que construirlos u optimizarlos para que sean lo mas rápido y mejor posibles,dotándolos de camarotes, cañones, velas, tripulación para que a la hora de navegar se puntúe lo máximo por las características del barco. 

Muy original y que funciona bien a dos jugadores.

Es uno de los juegos más valorados en casa.

Oh man...how bright can this game shine?! When I was trying to coordinate and put together my perfect flagship, it was an experience that was among the best I've had in this hobby so far. 

The problem is... the gameplay really falls flat if you're just churning out tiny featureless ships. You just repeat the same basic actions, ignoring the many things your ships don't need and it was kind-of boring. Unfortunately, that may be the most optimal strategy based on the starting tiles you draw.

And this game could have been one my of favorites... sigh

Launched at Essen 2009 alongside Dungeon Lords.  I am struck by the similarity in the two games.  In DL you are building your dungeon to survive the adventurers. In Shipyard you are building your ships to excel on their trial run.  Both games are very well crafted with differing mechanisms for acquiring your goodies.  Here Mac Gerdt’s rondel mechanism goes into overdrive, but with new tweaks to keep it fresh.  Both games have clearly undergone a lot of testing and the graphical presentation is top notch.  One minor complaint - the production standard is not quite to German (LudoFact) quality, with some of the multitude of pieces liable to tearing at the edges.

First game with two players took 2 hours (and the rules reading and piece popping another two).  But this was absorbing and fun.  Chvátil's influence is evident, in particular with the well worked end game, somewhat reminiscent of TTA.  Great to see a company that recognises all player's should get an equal number of turns, addressing one of the bugbears I have with many games.  Dominion anyone? The game played well with two.  However I have reservations regarding 3 or 4 players due to potential down time and an inability to plan much in advance as your turn options are dependent on your opponents.

Egy kicsit hosszabb, mint amire számítottam, de szép, jól megkomponált játék. A német változat ár-érték arányosan kiugróan az egyik legjobb darab szerintem a piacon. Az akcióválasztásban van egy kis újítás más játékokhoz képest, és a kihajózás is ötletes. Tetszett az is, hogy bármilyen akciók is maradtak a választékban, sosem éreztem, hogy hoppon maradtam volna, nem igazán vannak haszontalan akciók. Emellett irtó szépen kivitelezett játék, rengeteg anyaggal:)
Néhány dolog, ami nem tetszett: helyenként úgy éreztem, a kevesebb néha több lenne. Minden jól illeszkedett a játék témájába, minden mindennel összefügg, de ilyen alapon még 20 másik rondellát meg lapkatípust is beletehettek volna. Ha ez kell a kellő komplexitáshoz, akkor legyen, de néha kicsit öncélúnak, mesterkéltnek éreztem a választási lehetőségek némelyikét. Ami még gond, az a szerencsefaktor. Ha a szerződés lapkák (játékvégi bónuszok) nem lennének a játékban, akkor minimális szerencse lenne benne. Azok viszont teljesen el tudják rontani a játékélményt. Kaphat valaki olyan szerződéseket, amelyekből semmiképp sem hozhat ki 20-30 pontnál többet, másokkal viszont 50-60 bónuszpont is elérhető. Nem tudom, a játék alapszakaszában ki mennyi pontot szokott szerezni, de nálunk senki sem volt 50 fölött. Ehhez képest a végén kiosztott bónuszoknál nagyon durvának érzek 20-30 pontnyi "eleve elrendelt" differenciát. Ez a része kicsit komolytalanná teszi az amúgy komolynak tűnő játékot. Ezért nem is kap jobb osztályzatot. De még ennek ellenére is megvételre méltó játék:) Már ha van kivel játszani (nem túl rövid). Ja még egy megjegyzés: a pontszámláló miért csak 50-ig tart? Mindenki e fölött végzett, és simán elfért volna 100-as is a táblán.
---
A lapkákat nagyon nehéz volt kinyomogatni, még a Rát is alulmúlta ebből a szempontból a játék, de ez legyen a legnagyobb baj egy játékkal.

This is the definitive rondel game: it has five of them! There's one main rondel with an interesting tile mechanism and four more usual sub-rondels.
It is quite deep (it's probably more medium-heavy than medium weight) and challenging, and has a good production value. Furthermore, it's very scalable, with the number of rondel turns adjusted to be one/player. It has some problems too: it's quite fiddly when set up (but the fiddlyness during gameplay is not so annoying), and some complain about the balance of some contract cards, but I have to play more to make up my own mind on the subject.
Update october 21, 2010: the complaints about the contracts are probably true. Some are definitely better than others, giving a higher potential score. If anyone would provide a fix, it would be great!

Initial Impression: The quality of the components didn't wow me when we set up the game. However, the quantity of all the little bits sure was impressive. At it's heart, this is a fairly straightforward euro game whose uniqueness comes from a layered rondel mechanism. I particularly enjoy rondels because it forces you to plan a few turns ahead but be ready to change tactics quickly as new opportunities present themselves by what your opponent has done. By the end of the game, when you look over your ships for final scoring, you can feel satisfied that you've successfully planned and constructed something. I'm not sure if I'll end up playing Shipyards again, what with all the newer and shinier games hitting the table, but I am glad that I had a chance to experience this game.

After playing 3 2-player games, I really enjoy this game. The set up is somewhat irksome but you can get past it. I think 3 players might be the perfect number for this game (the 2 player game plays almost exactly as the 4 player game) and would really enjoy trying it at that player count. I would say it is a heavy weight Euro, but what do I know?

Fiddly but fun. Lacks tensions with 3, whilst with 4 there's enough competition for actions to keep it interesting. Main issue is that the seemingly all-important Government contracts are poorly balanced (some are awful!) and there a couple of killer combos available with them.

Edit: Up to 5 plays now and it's still good every time. Balance is better than first thought too, though still not perfect.

This is a good one. We've only had the opportunity to play this 2P so far (almost 20 plays), though it's been in Nicole's collection for years. Although I think adding some more players to the mix would make the game a little more interesting, I'm not sure it would be worth the increased playing time. 

The goal of the game is to build ships in your shipyard, sail them through your personal canals and at the end of the game see how well you were able to construct your ships to match your hidden goals. I really like the hidden goals- they remind me a lot of the characters in Troyes- you want to do well on them, but it isn't going to break your score if you can't max each of them out. You get four and halfway through the game you discard down to your favorite two.

It's very much a rondel-based game. There is a main rondel which players will navigate in order to choose their actions, this is very much like Glen More or even Mac Gerdts' games. On top of that, or rather behind, many of the actions have another rondel that sort of decides which piece of equipment you can select when you do the "equipment action" or what person you can choose when selecting the "take a person action". I've heard complaints on the graphic design of the board in relation to all of these separate rondels (too spread out, not easy to see) but I really don't find them a problem at all. I really enjoy the dual layered rondel system here, it's not only important to get the actions you need from the main rondel but also to get them at the right time.  

The goals all seem very balanced. You can take some of the higher scoring ones, but they leave you in a less flexible position during the game- where you also score points. There have been complaints on the balance of the goals, but I'm not seeing it in our plays. 

I think when I finally get a chance to play this one with more than two players I will get to see if the main action rondel works a little better (with 2P there is a little tweak, you get two markers on the rondel always moving your oldest placed) also the markets of tiles (especially ship pieces) will move around a little bit more. We'll see if that's enough to make me prefer it with more players.

RATING: 8.1
First thing that gets mentioned when people talk about Shipyard is the fact there are four rondels in the game. But I find the rondels in this game are just a clever way of injecting some price fluctuations in the different markets. For me the main attraction of the game is the action selection mechanic. You really have to manage this wel in order to gain enough cash to buy the so much needed extra actions. Cleverly matching your ship to the canal it will navigate (or the other way around) is also a prerequisite to do well in this game. And then there are the government contracts, these carry enough weight to decide the winner in the game so they can't be neglegted. The fact you get too decide between three of each kind is ok, but why you choose halfway through the game is beyond me. You really have to decide at the start which contracts to go for as you will need every available action to do well at them. All in all a cleverly designed optimization game where money is very tight.

A typical Euro where you are grabbing items from different places in order to complete your objectives in the most efficient manner. All this while dealing with your opponents actions which makes it more of a difficult endeavor to accomplish.

The theme is that you are building ships to sail as soon as they are completed. You get victory points for hidden objectives and for being efficient in your construction of your ship.

One of the game's charms is the multitude of rondels employed to grab items and resources. It is a bit fiddly with the plethora of tokens employed, but nothing major to detract from the game.
 
The different paths to victory, the mechanic used to select an action and the different employees with different abilities makes this game an engaging and tense puzzle that merits it's good standing here on the geek.

Having many mechanisms which meld into a game is a good thing, unless you have too many of them and end up with some which do not really belong. This game has one or two too many, which is too bad.

There are also a lot of little cardboard pieces, which can be hard to see from across a table. The money is extremely annoying.

Some of the things which you can also score on bonus cards, or in the canals are drawn onto ship parts, and they can be hard to see when other counters are put on the ships. The graphics could have been thought out better to take this into consideration.

A warning to anyone who buys this and doesn't see the other comments about it, but you have to be VERY careful when punching out the cardboard pieces as the die cutting wasn't good and many of the pieces have a high potential of tearing.

A good game. Very strongly thematic, which saves the game in a way as it without the theme easily could have become a soulless spreadsheet. Rules are simpler than I thought they would be with most of the components fairly self-explainable once you understand the icons. My biggest concern is that it fairly easily could play too long. We played a three player game, all new, and it took 2h50min, but with more players or those that are AP-prone it could easily be longer. It might actually get longer as the players get better at the game too, as players start to see more patterns and want to (and are able to) make more calculations.

This game grabbed me pretty darn good.  The government contracts help direct you to go a certain direction as you will need those bonus(s) at the end.  We played two player and I tell you, you run out of time *quickly*.  It's different to how alot of games work with taking actions, and I liked it.  I found the rule book to work very well in teaching the game...very clear, I felt.  The first game took awhile (3 hours) as we did learn from basically scratch (I read through the rules, somewhat prior) and once we had the flow, it moved along quite nicely.  It COULD suffer from AP and it did with us at specific times but many times you knew what you would do and the turns went quickly.  I could see different paths to go down in this one.  I'm pleased I picked this up.  

Oct 2014 - dropped to a 6 and traded.  Realized it was too putzy for me and the relearn curve on it turned me off.  

Update:  Second game of this with two still took 3 hours but we needed a refresher.  We played one rule wrong the first time with government contracts.  We missed the part where you discard four of the six you start with.  That made it easier to focus and made the game, for me at least, more intense and interesting.  I pushed it up to a 7 and could go up more if I play this one more.

This is a fun medium weight game that provides a nice blend of long term strategy with tactical gameplay. Players will need to optimize their use of 5 rondels, while trying to fulfill their end game contracts. I particularly enjoy the way that cash is often needed (for extra actions & getting the canals and boat pieces you need), but you will need to balance getting extra cash with action selection along with picking the newly opened and most popular actions. It isn't the best game I've ever played and I generally prefer heavier brain burn in games, but it is a fun and satisfying game all around.

RATING: 5
The game has some great ideas and mechanics, but somehow they didn't worked for us. 
You cannot define a long-term strategy and even selecting your action on the next turn isn't always obvious, so you must wait for your turn to check which options are available. The game has some downtime.

At the end the Bonus tiles can make a huge difference and they didn't seem to balanced.

A complex game of set collection and money/resource management.  Shipyards takes the rondel mechanic to the extreme because it includes rondels within rondels.  Most player actions involve moving a common pawn (one of several) on rondels to acquire/exchange resources.  The game also has several layers of set collection.  Once you have collected a set of ship tiles, you load the ship with sets of people and/or equipment, then test run the ship (for VP's) on sets of canal tiles that you collected.

Others say: role selection like P.R., secret missions

Definitely right up my alley: action selection with rondels! and an interesting round tracking mechanism that also manages to keep less visited actions enticing (with coins). I also appreciate the "goal" cards as it gives player's a vision to see through all the mechanics and options.  But the winner sure had a better set of goals than I did!  He pulled them off brilliantly and I'm not sure I could have achieved as many multipliers as he did with the same objective, so perhaps they are still balanced.  (But I'd like to play again with his objective for myself once ;-)

Rondels with set collecting, cash and secret agendas. Thought I'd like this one - didn't much.

Basic idea is simple, build ships, put stuff on them to increase speed and vps, then sail them. In play its a bit more complicated than that as the rondel mechanic means you can't always get exactly what you want (without paying too much) and it has a (annoying for me) worker placement 'rondel' where you can't do the action that others have just done until they move off (which I find frustrating rather than 'clever', a standard rondel would have been better I think).

If you try this with any AP prone players and it will descend into AP hell - taking hours and hours. With fast players it is bearable, but I lost interest about 1/3 of the way in and just wanted it over, it's too much of doing the same thing over and over and over and over with no 'build up' or advancement or change of pace.

Overall, not a game I'm at all desperate to play again, but could be convinced, as long as you play quick!

No luck factor, but also only little interaction. All moves are made to achieve long-term goals, so you have to plan carefully ahead and put all smaller elements into one working point-making machine. It nicely sticks to the "shipyard" theme - there is some feeling of really building a ship.

I like the mechanisms a lot.  The entire experience is a blast, up until the contracts are presented.  Then the concerns came up.  I understand that the contracts balance the game, but it almost feels like it's balancing to the point of normalization.  Also, with all of the different options to achieve the same goal, "blocking" someone's strategy seems nigh impossible.

These are first impressions, and I'm looking forward to playing it again.

Fiddly to set up. Tons of tiles and bits to place to get the game going.

Rondels gone mad. The design concept seems to be: "if one is good, why not five rondels."

I'm not a big fan of games where to have to "know" the best combos of tiles or cards. (à la Through the Ages or Puerto Rico). This games seems to favour insider knowledge of the best combos.

Nothing apparently broken, it seems to be an okay game. Not much player interaction, mostly multiplayer solitaire. A tad long for what it is.

Shipyard is dry, dry as hell.  In the past, I'd have loved it for this fact alone, whereas now, well, while I still like and admire those dry Euros, they have to be exceptional for me to love them.  Shipyard is thus far not exceptional.  Very good, but not great.  It is fiddly, more in terms of the chits themselves than game play, but that doesn't bother me.  The rondel mechanisms work fine, but are not terribly exciting.  Rather, what is to like comes from the cumulative effect of the game, a kind of solid satisfaction that settles on you, like sitting in front of a nice fire in your slippers and sipping some quality booze.  Nice, cozy, but in a sleepy kind of way.

What prevents this from being a very tense affair (aside from the theme) is the market system.  The tiles come out randomly, and there are so many options that really, what separates a good from a bad purchase falls strictly into the realm of micromanagement.  Yes, saving a penny here or there will undoubtedly help you, but how much?  Hard to say.  Long term planning, while possible, simply feels like more effort than it's worth.  If I don't get that one tile, well, there are others that will be just as good, and unless you are into doing constant microcomputations of cost/benefit ratios, the market just feels a bit limp.  Moreover, the hidden goal cards also leave a slight bitter taste.  As has been discussed in the forums, there is one goal that provides many many points (like 32) for constructing a not-at-all-unlikely number of boats, and yes, this card does seem hard to surmount.  Sure, you might be able to surmount it, but not when it's coming out at the end of the game!  Anyway, this is by no means a bad game, I enjoy playing it, but I rarely suggest it.  It kind of bumps along till the end, at which point you might have a little dash of unexpected rage to spice things up.

There is a lot to take in here - which mostly fits together in a way that makes sense but, although the rules aren't too complicated, the multitudinous options avaliable mean that the game is a complex one.  It is also on the long side - though it will take more plays to tell whether it is too long for its own good.  I would say Le Havre is a good comparator - on first play this is a lot slower but that's a slightly unfair comparison as Le Havre speeded up a lot with a couple of repeat plays.

It seems on first play that there are a number of routes to victory and I do like that.  First impressions are that the 'Government Contracts' are an important, perhaps vital, component of a win.  What's satisfying is that they drive players in different directions so this doesn't appear to be one of those games where you end up trying to do the same thing as the others but just a bit more efficiently. 

NB - takes up masses of table space so beware.

RATING: 4
Some good stuff, some weak stuff. I like that it plays pretty cleanly for a complicated game; this isn't Brass or Automobile with complexity for the sake of complexity, it uses consistent systems in consistent ways and so the complexity is in the actual decision-making rather than just the game.

For me, though, it's still just too much. Fans of Through the Ages will like this - getting anything at all done takes a *lot* of process. If the object of your creation, the ships themselves, had more of a feeling of narrative accomplishment, that would be OK, but they just feel like a bundle of parts.

Unusually for a CGE game, Shipyard is quite theme- and narrative-deficient. Too many little bits of theme-breaking elements here make it feel a bit weird and soulless. And the overall flow of the game is repetitive, it lacks any sort of narrative arc. Not terrible - if these things aren't that important to you it won't make that much difference - but for those of us who do, Shipyard is on treacherous ground.

I think this will find fans amongst the folks who like Ystari and maybe Treefrog stuff. For me, the design felt better and cleaner than what those companies usually produce, but it's just not efficient or exciting enough. 2+ hours for this is too much; I just don't think there is enough game or narrative here.

RATING: 7
Rondels galore with all kinds of things to consider!  Players must build boats, man them, equip them, and also have a route to sail them on, which are all done by a means of various actions, many of which allow you to manipulate various rondels to get what you need.

More than anything, the game is an interesting puzzle of trying to decide what you need and when, as many times the action you really wanted will not be available to you.  So, you always need to keep various option open to keep you moving toward your goals.

Updated 5/26/10.

I would love to write more, but I've only played this game a handful of times and only with two players.  Thus, I don't feel like I'm particularly well-situated to comment on things like game balance or replay value.

I can say, however, that I really enjoy the game, and that it has usurped Le Havre's place in my collection as a long, fiddly, tense, "too much to do, too few actions" sequencing game.

The big concern with Shipyard at this point is that the game doesn't provide a lot of opportunities for carefully interfering with other players.  You can't squat on actions like in Le Havre, de-value actions like in Agricola, outbid opponents like in Power Grid, or undercut them like in Vasco da Gama.  The game doesn't feel as solitary as all this makes it sound, but it does, at times, feel a bit arbitrary in the way other players' moves can affect your game without providing them the ability to harness and direct that interaction.

All-in-all, a very good game with a great theme, lots of good fiddly bits, and a fun mental workout.  Not the most original game, but a good one.

Wow.  Shipyard is an incredible achievement and one of the few games that make me marvel at the ingenuity of the designer.  It is categorized as a worker placement and tile-laying game, but I have never played anything like it.  The rules are not particularly complex, but this is a deep and very engaging game.  Remarkably, especially for a Euro, the gameplay evokes the theme perfectly.  I especially like the way in which shakedown cruises are incorporated into scoring - this aspect of the game is very clever, novel, and apropos to the theme.  Being permitted to keep multiple government contracts (i.e. secret objectives) until halfway through the game adds strategic flexibility, which I also like.  The only negatives of this game are the fiddly setup, the lackluster game boards, and the completely abstract nature of the employee tiles, but these are minor quibbles for such a fantastic game.

The overall goal is to make ships with various parts, and I really enjoyed figuring out how to put the ships together in order to maximize the points when they sail. You get some points for making ships with all sorts of stuff on them, but you’re trying to customize each ship so they meet your own two personal goals that you get before the game starts. I love secret, personal goals, and Shipyard has an awesome twist on this – you get 3 x 2 secret goals, so 6 in total. However, after the first half of the game is over, you immediately have to discard 2 x 2 of the goals so that you’re only sitting with those two secret goals that you’ll reveal at the end of the game. This means that you have half of the game to shape your strategy, but you have to fully commit to some of the bonus goals after the first half.

Shipyard is a very solitary game; it’s very hard to mess with each other, though of course there are some subtle tricks you can pull off to mess with your opponents. You can take tiles you know your opponents need, you can take the actions they want (though they can still pay gold to take the action), you can advance some of the rondels (especially the train cars market rondel) and some other stuff – but it’s basically the very subtle kind of interaction, so if you like games where you do your own stuff and your opponents cannot interfere (too much) with your plans, you’ll probably like Shipyard. My wife and I like these kind of games (like Castles of Burgundy), and we both liked Shipyard (though I seemed to like it more).

I’ve only played it with 2 players, and I suspect I would like it even more with 3 players (4 players would probably take too long; downtime could be an issue) – the reason is that there is an extra action available each round so you won’t feel so limited in your choices as more action spaces are available. Furthermore, the different tiles (shipparts, train wagons etc.) will change and be replaced faster; with 2p the tiles didn’t get refreshed fast enough I think, though of course this also means that you have more control of the game.

Shipyard has a lot of rondels, but to be honest they don’t really feel too much like rondels; you choose an action, and then another marker moves a space and you get the stuff you want. I do think the rondels work well together, and especially the rondel where you can choose something to customize your own game/ship is very interesting! All in all Shipyard is a very enjoyable, low-confrontational eurogame where it’s all about customizing your ships.

I love this style of game, and I can see giving this one a 10 on my list after a few more plays.  There are a ton of interconnected parts that intertwine making each decision at least a setup move for future turns, or a downright noodle twister.  The action selection mechanism is unique and how it interplays with money is a winner in my book.  The fact that you can spend money to take any additional action you want (even a blocked action) just adds to the overall depth and gives meaning to managing that particular resource in a refreshing way.  Must play again, soon.

Shipyard is a neat building game with a lot of interesting mechanics that I enjoy. I enjoy the games as it rewards you with a sense of accomplishment throughout the course of the game.

1. There are Goal cards that give you certain bonus targets to shoot for at the end of the game. I like Shipyard's use of these cards because you are dealt 3 (I think) at the beginning of the game, but have until the mid-game point to choose which one you want to keep. You are forced to evaluate your accomplishments and game path at midgame, which does leave you with a sense of, "Yeah - I can get that done. I can do that!" (as opposed to, "How will I ever do this?!!"

2. As you are building your ships you get to see them go from parts to fully functioning vessels right before your very eyes. You are in complete control (well, to a degree) of how to customize your ships. As the game goes on you build a nice little fleet of boats stacked around you. And it feels good!

Shipyard is a multi-faceted rondel-based game, probably THE rondel game at this point which incorporates set collection, planning, and a cash economy.

The basic idea of the game is pretty striaght-foward: build ships, put various items and crew onto them, and then run them through a "shakedown cruise" to see how good they perform in the real world. In practice, the game is full of decisions and trade-offs as players have to balance a central rondel, 4 sub-rondels, and a rotating tile display of trade goods, ship parts, and canals. In essence, most of the player goals in this game are dictated by special chits that are distributed at the start of the game that give out bonuses for having finished ships with certain elements on them (most of them), employee tiles of a certain type, or other similar factors.

The game is governed by a central action rondel that is made up of mini-chits that each allow one of the main actions to be taken. The chits move around the rondel as they are taken and are worker placement style in that one cannot take an action that already has a pawn on it, so the order and availability is always going to be different, which is a huge improvement on the more standard rondels.

I've played this game 3 times now, and I think it's a solid game with some interesting decisions. Balancing the rondels with the tiles with your secret mission chits is interesting and often difficult. The game is fairly complex to explain initially, but isn't all that trying in actual course of play. If I have any reservations it's the amount of replay, which is going to be purely subjective with this game. There are a number of different ways to win, as small boats, big boats, and fast boats all seem to be relatively balanced. There is also room for some variety in player strategies based on the employee chits which grant special powers which can make taking certain actions better than others. At present it's a solid game that I would be happy to play if others wanted to, but one which I don't think I would personally suggest all that often. I'm also a touch concerned that player strategies are too often forced because of the special mission chits; they're a huge part of your final score and can't be ignored, and at the start of the game you really have to evaluate what you can do based on those chits and then run with that as effectively as possible. It's not bad at all, but it's not good enough to make it up into a tier 1 ranking for me. On reflection, I've dipped my rating slightly as I think I've seen about all I personally need to here. It's an enjoyable enough game, but it's not something I would personally recommend at this point, which means it can't fall higher than a 6.

Lets see, there is a Rondel-type thing for building pieces of your ship, a Rondel-type thing for staffing your ship with people, a Rondel-type thing for a marketplace. Oh, also a Rondel-type thing for actually taking your turns. Too many Rondel-type things.  The great thing about a Rondel is the simplicity of play.  That has gone out the window when you introduce 4 of them.  Also on the theme side, I don't understand digging your own canal to sail your ship down.  Seems impractical, a better use of resources would be just to sail it down a body of water that already exists.

Better than an average game, because there are a couple modes. Building the ship is one mode, sending it down the river is another. I wish more game designers would go this direction, instead of their creations feeling the same from beginning to end.

There's good depth, because it would take many plays to figure out what strategies are better, and a person who likes brain burning can spend as much mental energy as they want in calculating the options and ramifications.

However, I like that the depth isn't forced on you. Players who are drinkin' beer and just wanting a carefree time can play this game too. Nobody will know who'll win, because there are so many variables, but everyone will get the satisfaction of having built something and sailed it through the checkpoints.

Ok, this was way better than the buzz I read led me to believe. I was a little worried the five rondels were going a little overboard (heh, theme fits), but it all worked great. This is sort of multiplayer solitaire, for people that like those things, but it's a rich sandbox to play in, trying to build your tweaked out custom ships, and sailing them. But everyone gets to pick some end-game scoring goals (I like that you're given a menu at game beginning, and have to commit at half-time), which are kept secret, so you don't know exactly how to block other players, which again, makes it sort of multi-player solitaire. But it's also action selection, and given that everyone is trying to build ships and sail them, you can kinda tell what people might want, and you do end up affecting each other quite a bit, but in an indirect way. Someone in my group has this already, but I like it enough I might have to pick up a copy as well, just for the family.

The action selection method is very good. The rest of the game sort of lags behind. In particular the bonus scoring is at rediculous odds with reality. If players had fewer options (for example excising the military officers and guns from the game) in how to develop their ships, and the costs for jumping ahead in a selection queue were more prohibitive I think the game would have a tighter more interactive feel.

RATING: 7
Shipyard is an efficiency puzzle game: there is no real sense of constructing an engine and getting it up and running; there is just a sense of getting the most points out of a fixed amount of turns given finite and fluctuating resources, and a lot of tactical blocking. The closest games I can think of are Cities, Ristorante Italia, and the duo Castles of Burgundy and Trajan. Don't be fooled by the presence of rondels to mistake this for a relative of the actual rondel games (i.e. Antike and friends). The rondels are just there to force the shared state into being. 

I think the designer did a good job in giving the players a lot of options to play with. Large ships, small ships, slow ships, speedy ships, taking a lot of expensive actions, taking a smaller number of cheap actions, it's all there. That is a Good Thing for what is essentially a puzzle game. Initially I was a bit apprehensive about the fact that you cannot always take the actions you want: you'll be playing suboptimally most of the time. The trick is, however, in recognising that these seemingly suboptimal actions can, later, quite often turn out to be very useful. In other words, don't force your way of playing onto the game, but let it 'guide' you to a certain extent and you'll see that there are still quite a number of possibilities.

Which brings me to the contracts issue. If you look at the bottom ratings you'll see claims about the game being (nearly) broken—but there is simply too much going on for that sort of conclusion to be drawn based on a handful of games. A contract which may appear weak may turn out to be very powerful [i]under the right circumstances[/i]. If a player does not recognise those circumstances and/or fails to bring them about he's already lost the game there and then. Simple as that. In my first game I could easily see that 'simply' building a good ship is [i]difficult[/i]: it takes time, lots of actions, and lots of money. Perhaps even harder is hitting on the right synergy between all various options and then sticking to it more religiously than a fundamentalist. I [i]will[/i] admit that some synergies are easier to spot than others, but that doesn't mean the game is broken—just that it rewards repeated plays.

With a somewhat smarter storage system I bought on the cheap, the game is also less fiddly to setup. Even after the small handful of games I've played to date I still enjoy working out the puzzles the title throws at me. It is not a superb(ly interactive) game, but what it does, it does well. Upgraded the rate, with pleasure.

A botar barcos en tu astillero! Sistema de juego a base de rondeles. Tableros personales para cada jugador donde vas viendo cómo construyes tus barcos. Muy entretenido! Me encanta!
Algunos critican que hay un contrato que está descompensado, que no hay apenas interacción, y que es un juego largo. 
Salvo ese contrato, lo demás no veo que sean pegas. Si vas a ese contrato en concreto del que hablan (es verdad que es muy potente y un poco roto) igual dejas de puntuar por otras cosas; también estará el aliciente de intentar superar al que creas que lo tenga.
Aunque yo sí que le veo interacción, a nosotros no nos importa que no haya mucha, al contrario, preferimos que no haya un excesivo puteo.
A mí no se me hace nada largo, porque de lo bien que te lo pasas, el tiempo vuela. Además, una vez que pillas cómo va, se juega muy fluido.
La única pega que le veo, a parte del dichoso contrato petado, son los componentes que dejan mucho que desear, y el coñazo de setup inicial y recogida final.
Hacía tiempo que no me compraba un juego y creo que he dado en la diana... Juegazo! Ha sido todo un descubrimiento y para mí tiene un sobresaliente!

The game has a lot of things to track, and it's really good economic game with ship building. You really feels build ship parts, components, and crews. My only gripe is that how to get money, is by railroad car, and it's really feels detached than the entire theme of everything else

The worst of Puerto Reeko meets Caylus and the semi-new:
RONDELMANIA!! 
(FREE BONUS- lots and lots of fiddly flat shipyard bits!)
Pick an action and then wait for someone to not choose it.
Most actions take you to one of 4 rondels to choose the action there (I know -the next action) or pay for it.
Planning? Building parts of ships not from the bottom up, but SIDEWAYS!...I forgot...it's a euro....

Pretty interesting theme.  First time, I missed a couple of game elements and was trounced, but was much better in the next game.  Lots of decisions about what turns to take and resources to get.  There's not a lot locked down: For example, if an option was already taken, pay 6 coins and take the action also.  Need a different resource? Pay extra to move the counter around.  I'll play again.

Can't believe the comments about "too fiddly", "too complex" or "too long". Perfect complexity and length IMO (for two players at least). Would've rated higher, but certain combinations of contracts seem to give too much of an advantage (so I guess that puts me in the "unbalanced" group).

This game has a lot of going on. You need to choose your actions, choose the parts for your ships, plan a bit ahead, do some tile laying and build up your engine. It takes some time though, but I didn't even notice the time flying while thinking what I need for my ships and how to get the best end score. Might be bit prone to AP.

Shipyard is great.  It takes do planning ahead without making your head hurt.  There is some competition for actions but the game deals with that.  I had fun with both two and three players.  The game has a theme that actually works also.  There are a lot of tiles but once they are sorted properly it is not a problem.  So you will want a Plano for this one.  Replay value is good.  The end game scoring cards help a lot, though an expansion to add more variety would be great.  Buy it.  Play it.  Keep it.

Now with more rondel!  Surprisingly fun, even if some of the mechanics don't make all that much sense.  I like building up your ship and sending it on a test cruise, and the player action mechanic is really unique.  I feel like it runs just a little on the long side for us, though, keeping it from hitting the table very often.  I'd love to get in more plays of it though.

This moderately heavy Euro game has a "moving rondel" sort of action-choice track, as well as 4 other more standard rondel-type action areas.

There is much to do in this game and it succeeds in making you feel like you really are building ships, manning them, and sending them on test runs through your canal systems.

Very nice.

The theme sounds cool, but then you are read the rules and it seems rather dry, but then you play the game and it isn't too bad after all.

Due to its complexity and length it doesn't get taken out that much.

What I liked:
* Lots of choices and strategies
* The limited action types you can choose from on your turn helps prevent a bit of AP

What I didn't like:
* The progress just feels soo slow! There are tiles that help efficiency of certain actions, but then you never get a chance to take those actions.
* Ending is rather clunky

RATING: 8
A number of common euro mechanisms combined into a diverting game. The movement of the ship through the canal is the most innovative element. Although the game features eight actions, only four will be available to a player on his turn (three in a two-player game), so his choices will not seem so daunting.

Good, solid Euro/rondel fun. Nothing particularly unique but very, very enjoyable.

edit: Put out six contract tiles and allow all players to complete any two by game end, non-exclusive. This silences all debate about imbalance. 

(My conclusion on the imbalance issue is that there is none where 'points potential' is concerned, but there is an imbalance on 'degree of difficulty'. In maxing out the various contracts, some are easy to score well, some require much more advanced play.)

Edit: Some games are obviously over halfway through. Some endgame tiles may just score more than others after all. And Krafwagen does everything Shipyard does in half the time. Rating dropped to a 7.

An enjoyable game with a good theme that is reasonably well implemented by the game mechanics although there are some rather non-sensical elements in terms of the theme in order to fit the gameplay.

The game provides an interestting challenge in terms of how to max your points and provides lots of choices - there are effectively multiple rondels determining what you can do and so there is lot's to think about - so far, so good.

The game does lack any real player interaction 0 you can't meaningfully block other players, which is good if you don't like confrontation in games, but does mean you are sitting building your own ships for two hours without any real connection with what otehrs are doing. The second failing is in the bonus victory objectives - now you do have some choice over these and can tailor them to the start you make but they do seem overpowered and if you get lucky in terms of them being able to 'stack' you are home and dry.

Would play again however and rating may udge slightly up (or down).

Excellent game.  A bit like Puerto Rico in that you select roles.  Roles that haven't been selected in awhile start to come with money. However, it does have a bit more downtime in that only the player selecting the role gets to do the action.

I like the secret mission cards which in theory should make each game different.  However, I wonder if some are just much better than others?  The mission card that gives you 32 points for 6 ships seems really easy to play and achieve.  The larger ships take a lot of careful planning and some good fortune w/tiles to be equivalent.

Depending on your secret mission card (end-game bonus), you can build lots of small ships, big hulking ships, ships with lots of sails, smokestacks, etc.

The game does come with a ton of components.  So it takes awhile to setup, explain, and tear down.  But it's worth the time investment!

RATING: 5
Shipyard is a rondel-driven action drafting game about constructing and test-driving ships. 

My interest is based on the large number of moving parts in the game. Not only do you have to manage the timing of your access to the available actions on the main action drafting rondel, but you also need to manage the timing of your access to the sub-rondels which control which particular, essential item that you pick up for your eventual test cruise. You need to select just the right canal for the boat you are building; you have to buy the boat parts that best fit with the equipment you want to deck the boat out in. You also get a set six of special goals that give you bonus points at the end of the game. While you only use two of the six special goals, you need to keep an eye on them to in order to ensure you get something out of them and are thus able to eke out a victory. 

My big criticism of Shipyard is the low level of interaction involved. In many ways it is even lower than that of Agricola or Le Havre; there aren't any limited resources you can take or even areas that you can block for any length of time. With the $6 bonus action your opponents can even move past any blocking you do.

This is not to say Shipyard is bad, but it is probably just too low interaction to work for me right now. Which is a damn shame, because  I like other parts of the game so much.

Players are running their own shipyard, building ships to contract.  Busy resource management/optimisation game where players take turns to grab an action of the rondel snake - a clever device that mimics a game clock as it completes laps of the action track.  Actions allow you to acquire good ship building stuff - bits of hull, crew, cranes, sails, etc.  When a hull is complete, you fit it out with your collection of bits and take it on a shakedown cruise to score points.  Bonus points for secret contracts are added in at the end of the game.  Mechanically, quite simple to learn, and around 45 minutes per player to play.  Looks lovely and scratches a nice meaty game itch; tons to do and not enough time to do it all in as you constantly butt heads with the other players.  Nicely integrated theme here - you'll be reaching for the brandy and cigars, and thinking you're Isambard Brunel in no time.  Excellent game.

Finally purchased this. I've hesitated to get this for my collection for over 2-3 years now. Rahdo convinced me to the get this one about 1 year ago, so I knew I have to buy this.

I'm surprised that the player boards are actually just printed paper (which I'm going to laminate). The cardboard pieces are medium thin, not terrible but could be better.

Just finished my 1st play.  It's definitely a fun game.  Player interaction is unavoidable, b/c someone is always on the spot you want to go to.  My biggest beef with the game is the set-up and break-down time.  There are so many tiny pieces that need to be added to your ship, you need to add 30 minutes to the stated time just to get started.

On the plus side, you've got lots of choices and avenues to create and sail your ship.  Maximize your efficiency, buy extra turns when you can and they're useful, and set off!

RATING: 8
Two years later and I still enjoy the game. Set-up and tear-down take a bit and it is a fiddly game, but enjoyable nonetheless. With some experience, end game bonus tiles still account for 1/3 of you points which seems about right. There is a tension throughout the game between doing what is easy and most immediately profitable versus taking a less efficient action which gives you more end game points. I also find that with two players there is much more interaction between the players and it has less of a multi-player solitaire feel. Thematically, there are pluses (you do feel like you are building ships and sailing them), and minuses (there is no narrative and bonus tiles are not thematic). Overall though, an upper tier Euro.

2016-05-09 : This is the kind of game where you make a plan, stick to it and execute it as best you can without deviating from your path. Timing is important so the other players don't hinder you, but once you manage that it is kinda solitaire. The only minus point is the tiny bits - especially the money. It left me feeling this game was originally designed with components at least 50% bigger.

[1 play]  This game sounded dull when I first heard of it, but I was prevailed upon to try it, and found it most delightful.  It’s bursting with bits, and explaining the rules and what everything was took a good while.  But I soon found that it all was very clear and made good sense.  

There’s role selection, as in Puerto Rico, except that only you get to do the thing you pick.  I’d really think of it as action selection.  The opportunity to pay to do bonus actions is pretty important, not just for getting more actions, but for being able to do things you need that others have taken.  There’s a Vinci-like mechanism where choices that are passed over accumulate value.  The workings of movement on the action track were the only part of the game I initially found confusing, but it became clear once I saw it happen for a while.

I really like the way you get a final action (which is not constrained by anyone else’s choice) and then a final ship piece at the end.  This gives everyone an equal chance to wrap up whatever they’re building and get a final ship launched.  

I also like the secret government contracts.  I like games that have this sort of hybrid scoring, where you rack up some score as you go along, but then there’s a burst of scoring at the end—and especially if it’s for something that’s secret until the end.  And I like the way you have halfway through the game to choose your contracts, and then have to commit.  This gives you a chance to have some choice, so that you shouldn’t ever feel (as sometimes in Agricola) that you lost the game in the initial deal of the cards.  

I think my focus next time is going to be on the employee track, which is of course most valuable at the beginning since its bonuses and special powers last for the whole game.  I got a few things from this track in our first game, but I didn’t know then which things would be most valuable to me, and I didn’t even realize exactly what all of them did.  

I’ve only played this with 4, and I think 3 might be ideal.  There’s definitely some downtime on the other players’ turns, though you can use it for planning, so it’s not dreadful.  But with 3 players, not only would the game have less downtime, but you’d also get more actions per round, probably leading to being able to accomplish more overall and higher average scoring in the 3p game.

I like how the board is divided into two boards, which you can position in different ways to best suit your playing space.  That was very well thought of.  

Really looking forward to playing this excellent game again.

Like this game a lot, but as mentioned in the forums, I think some of the bonus cards are unbalanced, and cause too much of a swing in the end game.

I've had a few tight games in which we've all been pleased with, but then we add in the bonus point cards and someone gets an extra 60 points.  WTF?!? I could have saved two hours and just declared the winner after we all were dealt our bonus cards.

Next game I think I'll remove the "Largest fleet" bonus (32 points!!!) and maybe 1-2 others and see if I like it better.

Shipyard is another solid game from our Czech friends at CBE. It features almost everything that gamers look for in a solid medium weight game, starting with a credible theme, which in this title is more evocative than most, and is backed by some solid and interesting mechanics. The rondels work together pleasantly, and the way that the action selection track works is particularly interesting. Although Shipyard does have somewhat of a multiplayer solitaire feel, it can't take away from the fact that it's a wonderful challenge and tremendous fun; furthermore, the competition for actions is often tense, and being able to take the actions that your opponents want ensures that interaction is still very present. A solid strategy game with a convincing theme and a blend of numerous interesting mechanics, Shipyard deserves more attention from gamers that it has received. Building your ships and sending your fleet out to sail is a thoroughly rewarding activity, and those prepared to take on this challenge and not dismiss it too quickly, will find themselves with a gem of a game that bears returning to many times!

-ve: a bit heavier than Hansa Teutonica (weight of 3.5 vs 3.1), more complex than Puerto Rico, not as easy to learn; bit fiddly and many moving parts, long set-up time.  
+ve: it has relaxing, non-stressful play, unlike Agricola, and isn't as intense or confrontational, more multi-player solitaire.  Best with 2-3 players, about 30-45 minutes per player, a somewhat `different' theme (building ships instead of cube-pushing!), and gorgeous components; idea of secret objectives (are they balanced? can [thread=526027]amend one[/thread] if necessary) is fun.

The idea of the game sounds clever -- you draft actions that enable you to move on other rondels, so all your action choices are in a state of flux, and you have to consider these wheels within wheels. Sounds really cool, yet it came off flatter than I expected, mechanical with little tension. And with so many moving parts, I found myself locking up in a bit of AP in trying to determine my most efficient moves and such. There's a good bit of set up/tear down too.

I was surprised to find that it was not nearly as complex to learn and play as it seemed at first.  There are many ways to build your boat and you choose the VP markers you want to sail over, so you pick your path and build your ship accordingly.  All sounds very complex and interesting but it came off as lacking tension: “Eh, if I can’t get a captain, I’ll get a propeller. Need one of those too.” And since you can pay $6 for a bonus action, you’re rarely locked out of anything. Nothing to hook me into coming back to this one.

Okay -I've played this monster twice, and feel up to jotting down a few notes about the gameplay and other subjects. 

Shipyard is a very complex, convoluted and intricate game: a whirling monstrosity of rondels and fussy bits that don't always mesh well together. The game is overly complicated for the enjoyment it provides. Ever feel like a game was a bit too empty or simplistic for your tastes?, like you were banging around in a big empty shell of an experience looking for something to do? Shipyard is the exact opposite. Shipyard is full of whirling bits and parts that require constant attention in order to muddle along. Some people enjoy that experience, but I do not. I prefer something a bit more streamlined and elegant. Shipyard's high complexity and weight is due to the sheer number of working parts. Lastly, if you fail to keep up with your opponents during play - no worries! The neat little end game mechanism can permit you to zip ahead of your opponent at the last moment!
 
The theme: I am left scratching my head. You can assemble a ship for nothing, by securing the needed components from the "free bins" provided by the rondel mechanisms. Your ship, when rated for victory points, is judged in part by the passengers it carries on its maiden voyage. Excuse me? The game has several such weird little nuances that jerk you right out of the immersion. "Money for nothing, and the ships are free."

The components: The components look nice, but are easily damaged. It is nearly impossible to punch out the hundreds of components without causing cardboard mayhem in the game box. The components are VERY fragile. 

Verdict: If you like heavy complicated games with lots of moving parts, then try this game. 

If you prefer elegance over intricacy, stay far away.

While the game [i]is[/i] cool, I just can't get over the player interaction, and that is coming from someone that would say something like Race for the Galaxy has a lot of player interaction.  While what the other players do definitely affects your choices, most of the time they don't know what you want and if they do, it's not worth taking that action over something else they need.  All players having access to the same rondel pieces diminishes the classic tension I feel when skipping over a particular action space, since you never know exactly what space the rondel will be on when you have the next opportunity to use it.

Fun game to play.  The longer the ship, usually the higher the score.  I launched the first two ships (short ones), but didn't win the game.  The player with the longest ship launched last but had a really good score for his ship.  Played a second game, with a much higher score than the first time, and had three long (7+ piece) ships this time.  Lost again, but had fun anyway.  Lost yet again, but still fun (except for set-up and putting-away).

Tentative rating following first play.  Set up time was a little long, as was the game (3 hours) but I'm hoping this will drop nearer to two hours when we know the rules.  

The game was fun to play and produced a few laughs along the way - especially when one player built a full size ship forgetting the stern section (Yes I know this is invalid but we were learning the game).  The multiple rondel mechanism worked well, especially the moving action rondel where action choice and income have to be carefully balanced.

Ugyan nem két perc volt a szabálymagyarázat, de ennek ellenére meglepően könnyen játszható a játék. Az akciók elemiek, és logikusak. Emiatt a játékmenet is pörgős, ami nagy pozitívum egy heavy eurónál.
Ugyanakkor a szokásos cg játék: tele apró, fiddly komponensekkel, amiknek a szerintem a fele is bőven elég lett. Nem mondható egy elegáns darabnak. Szinte minden alkatrészt egyszer-kétszer kell csak használni a játékban. Jó lett volna ha valaki lecsupaszítja és gatyába rázza a kiadás előtt. Maga a játékmenet nem rossz, de azért vannak kétségeim a tervezhetőségével kapcsolatban, bár ezt egy játék alapján azért csak zárójelesen merem megjegyezni. Van benne interakció, ami főleg az akciók alakulását, illetve az akciókkal megvehető dolgok készletét befolyásolják. Lehet benne előre tervezgetni, hogy de hogy meg is maradjon neked pont az a három hajóelem, ami majd jó lesz amahoz a térképlapkához arra azért kicsi az esély. Ez fajta interakció nekem azért a bosszantó határán egyensúlyoz.

Shipyard looks like a very complicated game at first glance: lots of little tiles and counters, two game boards with more rondels than you can shake a stick at, lots and lots of choices. In short, AP heaven.

While it's true that there are quite a few choices each turn the actions themselves and not only fairly short and simple but also nicely thematic, meaning the game flows much easier than you would expect. It's actually much more complex than complicated. Of course it also helps that many of the available choices, especially with regards to the equipments and crews are merely different in form, not function. Many of them work in similar if not identical ways. A bit more differentiation would have been nice here.

It is also true that the game is not a very interactive affair. Everyone needs to figure out their own personal puzzle, and blocking or starving other players isn't really possible. Add to that that the game competes with other heavyweights in its class like Brass or Le Havre and it becomes a bit of a hard sell.

Nevertheless, if you like puzzling over the most efficient use of too few actions, squeezing out a guilder here and a point there, Shipyard certainly fits the bill. It does what it does very consistently.

"Fitzelig", sagt der Grobmotoriker. "Schön gemacht" entgegnet der Feinsinn und begegnet der Kleinteiligkeit mit großzügiger Milde. Der kleinteilige Aufbau suggeriert ein komplexeres Spiel als es ist, bleibt aber im Kern der heutigen Vielspielerzeit ein recht eingängiges, überschaubares wie wunderbares Jungstemaspiel aus der alten CSSR, Europameister 1976: Schiffe bauen und ausstatten mit Segel und Schornsteine Mensch (Kapitäne, Soldaten, friedlich Reisende) und Maschine (Lastkräne, Kanonen) und auf der Jungfernfahrt Punkte kassieren für eben jene und weitere individuelle Ausstattungsmerkmale wie Beiboote, Rettungsringe und Nebellampen. Das Ganze über Aktionsfelder, die mit Aktionsrädern auf dem Plan korrespondieren. Natürlich werden auch Regierungsaufträge am Ende belohnt. DIE WERFT ist ein konstruktives Aufbauspiel, indem selbst die vorübergehende Blockade der Aktionsfelder gegenüber Mitspieler eine milde, weil halt vorübergehende bliebt. DIE WERFT ist ein richtiges Liebhaberspiel, das von mir treu und innig geliebt wird. Darüber hinaus eine Empfehlung für alle Hamburger, Danziger, Schiffskapitäne und sonstige Hafengegendbewohner.

First off the bat, I did not think I was going to enjoy this game. It looked like a such a mess on the board, with so many rondels, a bunch of tiny tokens- yeah an absolute disaster looking sort of game! Weird rules! 
And I wouldn't say Shipyard is a very fun game, but it is a very smart game and expertly designed, even with the rondel/token explosion on the board. I found myself very much involved putting everything together, and thank goodness, turns come by quickly. The two smartest aspects are the modular action track and the bonus contract selection. Two extremely smart ideas that I've never seen before. And the rest of it works too. That being said, I didn't feel like hooping and hollering at any point- perhaps because of the multiplayer solitaire aspect that is most of the game. But it's a very good game to play and I'd like to try it again some time.

Unconventional game about assembling little ships and outfitting them with crew and upgrades, then setting sail and scoring points.

This is based on only one play, but the game was pretty good. Play time wasn't too bad with 4 (about 2 hours), and even though I didn't win the scores were all close and I got a lot of pride from my completed ships. It's a lot of fun, great components, definitely worth trying.

Simple building game, with a novel rondel mechanic for determining choice of actions.  Many ways to score or get money to help you score.  The choice of scoring cards dictate much of your strategy and have a big impact on final scoring.  Interaction is light --subtle and low impact.

Lengthy game that uses a number of rondels.  Not particularly difficult to play once you get past all the pieces and setup time.  I really like it as I enjoy building games and seeing different ships built.  One criticism may be that the final contracts aren't necessarily balanced very well and may pre-determine the winner...but I still enjoy the experience!

RATING: 4
Ugh, more bloat than boat. Deathly dull solo optimization Euro with absolutely no opportunity for direct player interaction. Choosing player actions is more a matter of riding the waves of fate. And the initial set of super secret endgame goals to create your very own personalized combo-powered path to victory is a mechanic I'm growing to detest.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
So many rondels!  At its heart a set collecting game, but the intricate action aspects do make it more interesting, with many routes to victory.  About half way through the first game you start to 'get' it.  And knowing the values of the various government contracts is important.  Looking forward to more tries.  

After 3rd game we are leaning towards the '6-ship card is too powerful' school.  I think it is mainly because we haven't played enough to optimise our points on the regular shipping - having higher scores there would make up for the otherwise high score you get for this one.

RATING: 9
Which comes first, the chicken or the egg ?? Do you hire a captain or buy ship pieces or canal permits or equipment for the ship or materials to make equipment.  Ah what a delemna, a ship cannot sail without a captain or at least three key pieces and the ship has little value without equipment and if you do not have a canal permit when the ship is completed the ship goes to the scrap yard.  A lot of things to keep your gears turning. A sand timer is a good component to add to the game.  The game has 481 pieces and 4 compartments in the box. I like the game so I made little boxes from heavy wt. paper.  Then I saw another member's boxes that have graphics so I added graphics to my boxes.  But there is no place to put your ships once they launch !! Sliding them onto the table just won't do. So I made a port (snips from Google Earth) for each player.  The boxes and ports make start up and clean up much much faster.

I'm concerned that having the number of spaces on all the Rondels evenly divisible by the number of players in four player games will tend to create problems with repetitive turns in a game that really requires a variety of actions; more plays will tell if that's a consistent problem.

There are some minor, but annoying, graphic design problems, like the bow pieces looking very similar to the amidships pieces.

RATING: 8
Very satisfying strategic euro game with 5 different rondels. I really feel the theme of game - particularly collection of different ship parts, equipment and hiring crew for my ship I am building. Contracts (secret goals) also keeps you focused on some goals as well. Ships look great when they are build. Much strategy and planing ahead (because you know, which actions might get free for using). Elegant action selection system in two player game, which is implemented like there were 4 players playing. Regarding some drawbacks, there are some minor. As first, there are very much small components and they all are made from thin card board. Also card board components could be in a little bit better quality. However the aesthetics is great. Overall - great game with great theme and art, highly recommended for such low price!

RATING: 7
Shipyard feels like an Ystari game, where your task is to navigate through a densely interweaved set of mini-mechanisms in the most efficient way possible.  Also like an Ystari game in that there isn't much that separates the beginning from the middle or the end of the game.

I don't usually like this style of game, but Shipyard is better than most games in this style.  The different ways to score points add a lot of drama which might otherwise be lacking.  First, there are the government contracts: long-term goals that are worth enough points to make or break you.  But you get to choose among several, allowing for many different strategies.  Second, there are the canals, containing inspectors who evaluate specific aspects of your ship as it passes their station. Choosing the right canals (i.e. placing the proper inspectors in the path of your ship) can add a lot to the value of a sensibly built ship.  The combination of the canals and the government contracts allows players to pursue highly specialized strategies if they wish.

The crowning glory of Shipyard is its brilliant action selection track.  The actions that players can select each turn are little tiles that snake together in a constantly changing queue.  At the start of your turn, you take the tile sitting under your pawn and move it to the head of the line.  You then move your pawn to the action you wish to select this turn.  You can't select the action you just moved to the head of the line, and you can't select actions covered by other pawns.  You gain 1 buck of income for every pawn that is positioned ahead of your selection.  So you make money by selecting the trailing actions in the queue.  The most popular actions will tend to bunch up near the head of the queue, since they're the ones that were selected last round.  You may need to select a less powerful action just to get some needed cash - or to deny the other players cash by staying near the back of the pack.  It all works together in a wonderful and agonizing way.

If, like me, you haven't enjoyed "rondel" games in the past, there's no need to be frightened by Shipyard.  The four(!) rondels in this game don't govern your available actions as in other rondel games.  They're simply a way to inject some volatility into the prices for the various commodities in the game.  For example, with the Hire Crew action, I currently might be able to get a soldier for free, a propeller for 1 buck (yes they're considered crew), a businessman for 2, or a captain for 3.  If I really need a captain, I can grab him now at a premium, or select an entirely different action and hope that someone advances the rondel to make him cheaper.  But that will involve waiting at least two turns for the Hire Crew action to become available again . . . unless I have 6 bucks to pay for an additional action, which will allow me to select an action that's not currently available.  So you see how the planning in this game can get a little tricky.

Very good game if you like the rondell mechanism!  This Euro has a strong theme.
The decision are sometime agonizing.  Do I send my ship for the test cruise now or delayed it and improve is speed or had more crew/equipment to score more points?
The secret random objectives should influence your strategy.  Some objectives are way better than other so I use the [geekurl=/thread/685882/communal-contract-variant]Communal Contract variant[/geekurl] and it fix this game's only flaw.
At the end of the game, its very cool to see the ships you've build.
I love that you can win the game by doing 2-3 large ship that takes you the entire game to build or by doing 6-7 smaller ships.

Euro de construcció de vaixells mitjançant losetes. Els vaixells es formen mitjançant tres tipus de losetes: proa, popa i casc i s'han d'"equipar" amb velas, chimeneas, tripulació, etc... Un cop construits, els vaixells fan una travesia per unes losetes de canals on s'obtenen punts en funció de l'equipament. Els recursos s'obtenen amb una serie de rondels que es poden fer servir amb un mecanisme d'accions similar al del Glen More.

No m'ha agradat gaire com es fa la puntuació, el mecanisme de selecció d'accions està bé però el joc és una mica solitari...

Only played two player game, which works well. The action selection mechanic is really interesting and makes the otherwise repetitive game a good one. It's funny how you only have a couple choices for action, which makes you frown, but then you notice that every time there's something good in those few actions, which brings the smile. And after a couple of these turns you realize that all these good actions come in totally wrong order to be effective. At that point the game (and the turn angst) really kick in.

RATING: 5
Rondel-fest, with some neat mechanics.  The variable action track is a really neat idea and works really well- it serves as timing mechanism, worker placement, and increases the value of certain actions based on how recently they were taken.  Other than that, it uses a bunch of rondels, a mechanism I like, but it seems pretty bland here.  One big gripe I have is that the game is way too long for how fun it is.  A lot of who wins will be determined by the combination of special scoring cards dealt out at random at the beginning of the game.  You spend your turns building ships to send out and score VPs based on what you put on them and how efficiently you planned their routes.  You do this over and over for about 2 hours then you finish and score up your bonus cards,  Very blah and dry.

Rondel madness.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A new twist on the rondel game, in that the rondel has its spaces in a constantly changing sequence. This is a competent enough set-collecting game, but there are no difficult decisions. What you're doing is largely determined by the goal tiles you draw at the start and by the next bonus symbol (or two) that you'll be sailing over on your next shakedown cruise. I'm not a great fan of rondels at the best of times, this is better than most, but with tight scoring a sense of that arbitrary 'One more turn, I'd have won' feel is difficult to avoid at the end.

RATING: 9
Best game of 2009?  I think so.  It's very complex, with rondels referring to a single, central rondel, in a way that gives you a LOT of options but narrows down what you are thinking about at any given time--a number of deeper trees rather than a giant wide tree. I like that. I also like collecting bits that will eventually be a ship, and figuring out the best way to fit these together.  The secret goals, which I don't always like in other games, work here to provide some direction as to what to work on.  And it's always fun deciding whether you want a fast ship, a very important ship, a ship that you can easily drive in the dark, or what, and getting to test out the thing you've been building is also a bonus in a building game.  I also enjoy the slightly whimsical art.  There's a lot here, it's long, and it certainly isn't for everyone, but I love it.

Looks fiddly when you get it out of the box, turns out to not be too bad though. Flowed nicely as a game and the Rondels really worked. However (and it is a big however) I didn't like the individual randomly assigned scoring cards for the end. It felt to me like the difference in scores was mostly determined by this. So if I get this then I'd want to vary it to a draft system of some kind.

I could tell from the beginning that this would end up being one of my favorites. Sure, it's big and complicated, a hardcore "eurogame" for sure, but I love it for exactly that reason. The game really gives you the feeling that you're running a shipyard company, building custom-made ships while dealing with a constantly fluctuating market. It's also a game that nicely uses a mechanic where manipulating the turn order is important. Despite a good amount a depth, it works very intuitively once you figure it out, and so far my experiences have been enjoyable.

I am generally tired with traditional, soulless Euro-games. Still, I find this one interesting, to say the least. Perhaps it is because of the rondell (my first game utilizing this gimmick) or the fact, that you get to build stuff (appealing to my feminine gamer side), but I have lots of fun every time I sit down to play this one.

Regardless of my personal feelings: the gameplay is solid, meaty and deep enough to please any involved Euro-gamer, although Shipyard is a little on the "fiddly" side.

Shipyard successfully mixed couple of game mechanism inside. The main game system reminds me Glen More a lot. The most interesting part of the game, which the shipbuilding, is primarily based on set collections. I am sure Shipyard is a nice game and provides certain fun. However, I've found a few drawbacks of the game. First, the game parts are horrible to handle with. Components are too small to manage. Second, the game theme is decorated a bit superficially. Even though ghe game shows the working environment of dockyard, it was not smoothly presented the real feature of shipyard. The game is well dressed up the dockyard theme, but the final features are a little awkward. Third, the game, Shipyard, takes quite long time to play. In my first play, I spent about 3 hours with 4 players game. Shipyard provides certain fun, but the game was slightly far from my taste.

First game was enjoyable. Set-up very long and the game has little interaction, but it was still enjoyable. An interesting building game, using a mixture of the rondal action mechanic and worker placement blocking found in Le Havre. I found that in terms of the money earning players actually needed to give up the initiative, so for some players you can always be choosing actions with no monetary benefit. Exactly what the impact of this is I couldn't say after one play.

A timed game of shipbuilding in the 19th century.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Lets get the obvious little problems out of the way.  Setup and take down for this game is a bit of an issue.  It may all be necessary, but it has about wargame level of setup for a Euro.  Its another game with the squinting mechanic, meaning, I am going to spend a fair amount of time leering over the board to make sure I SEE everything every turn.  Then, its got rondels in rondels, which is not quite as annoying as it might seem when described, but still gives a feeling of being a bit overwrought, and complicated for complication's sake.  And then there is the length.  It did not overstay its welcome with me, but I am not sure a little more development might not have made this a more competitive game in terms of table time.  As it is, it would struggle after we had been through the "Essen season."  Finally, complaints about group solitaire that usually apply to engine building or efficiency games apply equally here.  Yes, the rondels give you sort of a false sense of interaction with your fellow players, but for the most part you are doing your own thing.     

But, on the flip side, there was a lot to like.  While it has an enginge building component, it mingles well with an efficiency game as there are certain actions you MUST do.  Sure, you can make a ton of money with the railroads, but you still need to get a captain.  You still need to build ship parts, you still need some map to sail on.  So this restrains the ability to pursue the perfect strategy.  

That said, there are several different paths to victory that suggest themselves, and they all seemed worth exploring.  

The game also mixes a strong tactical component -- what am I going to choose this turn, with a more strategic planning element.  You can't just do what's best this turn, cause there's a lot of stuff you just HAVE to get done.  

It also intermingled with a new and interesting theme -- shipbuilding, and while the game is not "thematic" in any meaningful sense, I was happy that is eschewed the theme of the month (Italian Villas, Egyptian Pyramids,  The Great Wall or whatever we are doing this year).

I remain concerned about the bonus tiles and their impact on the game.  They are distributed randomly and some combinations are just going to be better than others.  This would be forgivable if they didn't play such an overblown role in final scoring.  I usually want a bonus tile to add uncertainty about the leader -- not upend the current score.  Our bonus tiles basically doubled our scores.  That seems to potentially swallow too much playtime. Furthermore in an extended tactical tug of war, where you are searching for little efficiencies, you just don't want all your hard work undone with something that did not involve choice. A tamer application of these points would have made me more comfortable with the design and probably added a point to my rating.

DRY game.  And a soulless one.

Interaction is purely accidental.

Absolutely nothing here raisining my adrenaline level.  Everybody just fiddles with his board and ships and at the end somebody is hailed a winner - zero emotions.

(possible lack of balance (bonuses for secret goals) and no fresh mechanisms don't help either...)

SOLD.

You'd better go play League of Six by the same designer.

RATING: 7.7
In Shipyard, players use a nice blend of mechanisms to build ships from various tiles, which are then used to generate victory points, the amount of which depends on a number of factors, mainly the composition of the ship.  There are plenty of difficult decisions to be made but it is clear that special care was taken to make sure that the game was not a frustrating experience (i.e., while there are limited resources and players can block other players from said resources, there is always a way for players to spend more money or take alternative actions to get the needed resource).  The game manages to tie-in nicely with the shipbuilding theme, making this an enjoyable thematic puzzle of a game.

Lots of rondel action.  There's even a rondel to select which rondel to use (although there are also options that don't include rondels).  Not as AP-inducing as I expected, which I attribute to the goal tiles.  In my first game, anyway, I was able to ignore many of the options available to me and just focus on the actions dictated by my goal tiles.  Still, one of the other players was having AP problems, so maybe I got lucky.

This games looks so complicated given how many pieces are in the game, however this game plays lighter than castles of burgundy. It is very intuitive and didn't take much time or effort to learn. I have successfully taught this game to my dad (a non gaming muggle). I've played this game a few times and if you play with a slow player the game can drag a little. I love that it's non confrontational and yet even when someone take an option you wanted to take the game is very flexible and you are never left feeling there is nothing to do or your turn is ruined. This is a fun game and does visit the table quite often, set up can take a little bit as well as take town. I bought some little plastic cups from the dollar store and it makes set up and take down much easier (10 cups).
A few plays later and one of the end game scoring tiles seams unbalanced and too strong. Everyone who gets it wins. Recently I found a game that I think will help fix this problem and resurrect this game for me and my wife. We each get our secret goals but at the end of the game we will score all goals for all players. It adds a little deduction into the game and fixes the imbalances.

At first I didn't like the setup time for all the bits. During the game, I realized many of the components can be preorganized so that they don't need to be set out at the beginning.

The game is enjoyable. I like building ships and sending them out to be evaluated.

There are 4(5) rondel like devices, as well as two drafting mechanics (one for hulls and the other for water way paths) used in this game.

RATING: 6
I'm not at all sure what to make of Shipyard. On the one hand, it's a robust development game that lets you build cool ships. On the other, it takes a long time to build a single tricked out ship. So while there is a ton of stuff to do, I'm not sure you'll get to do all that much in the time allotted. Also, the game sort of tells you what strategy to follow at the beginning, which is odd. 

The real issue here is the 5 rondels. Certainly not brain-burning, but to actually navigate them well probably requires an effort that, for me, is out of whack with how much it would enable. I'm just not sure if I care about watching five rondels. One play seems to indicate than you [i]can[/i] just take the moves as they come and make a decent ship or two, but I don't think that's going to be exciting. Also, where's the replayability in this game? Just being funneled randomly into a strategy at the outset? Where's the maneuvering (other than rondel watching)? 

A weak 7 because it's aspiring to be the sort of thing I like. Not sure it gels, though.

I love this game! This has a lot of planning and strategy. The government contracts are a significant source of points and must be carefully chosen. All points come from sailing ships (almost) so deciding how you're going to optimize sailing points while also optimizing your gov. contracts is the core of the game.

This is a limited action game which creates tension while you try to complete your goals in the allotted actions. Additional actions can be bought but money is a tricky thing to get since it usually means you passed on a more desirable action. In a sense this makes the game a bit contrarian in an odd way since you would like to want actions that your opponents don't want. Deciding what action to take each turn can be challenging.

The game works very well at 2, where it's also a lot shorter. The box says 30min/player and this is probably true for experienced players. We've found the time for new players is about 45min/player. Don't let the length scare you off, it doesn't feel that long and it gets better after the first play.

Very impressed so far, and amazed that this game isn't more popular.

The problem with this game is that it claims a rare spot with heavy competition. You need true gamers who ideally all know the game and are ready to start through. Otherwise, game explanation will take a long time. Setup will need it for sure. All this coupled with two hours+ playtime leave (too) many other games as the probable choice.
On the plus side, this game has a strong theme implementation and once you got down all the special symbols it flows together smoothly. The graphic design is among the best I have seen. The game feels like Galaxy Trucker with an added economic engine. I would play it again to explore the strategies and to verify my impression that the available actions differ too much in their strength. But I don't see a place for it in my collection.

I really like the way this game works.  The rules may seem a bit overwhelming, and there are a lot of moving parts, and I think that's what makes it neat.  Between when to launch ships and how big to make them and how much to pay and where to be on the rondel, there's a lot to balance.  Very cool game.

This is an interesting game to think about, as you can approach it from so many angles.

First off, there is no arguing that the game is as fiddly as can be.  A ton of little chits (punching the game takes forever), even with an organizer there are a lot of pieces flying around to keep track of.  

The rules feel long and if you are not careful in your explanation they can seem confusing and dense.  But once you start playing it is pleasing how simple the game works.  The multiple rondels don't make the game any more complicated than others.

Having a finite number of turns, this type of game would seem to favor extreme planners, which I certainly am not.  I would avoid this game at all costs with AP types, since it would be interminable.  The turns, like other rondel games, should be very quick, as your choices are fairly constrained.

I enjoy the theme, since it is moderately unique, and it is entertaining to build up something yourself.  It seems like you really need to pick a strategy early and stick with it at all costs.  And don't underestimate the importance of money - those bonus turns are absolutely essential!

Very good game but the play time was longer than it enjoyment for me. 4-player games took over 3 hours and although I am sure that would have shortened with more plays, I did not feel it was worth the investment. Also, in 3-player games, the bonus contracts could really make the difference in who ended up winning the game which took away much of the enjoyment after spending two+ hours to get there. I would be surprised if we do not see this game redone in the near future slightly more streamlined (and maybe set in space :-)).

Отличная, "мясная" евронастолка средней сложности. Взаимодействие между игроками практически отсутствует, но для данной игры это не минус. На протяжении всей партии можно спокойно строить свой огромный "титаник", скоростную яхту или несколько мелких катерков. От законченной работы чувствуешь настоящее удовлетворение.

Wow, there are boring games and then there is Shipyard. 

This game is a perfect example of a boring game: you do the same tiny moves over and over and over and over and over again until the game finally ends. The game doesn't change at all during its considerable length, it literally goes through the same motions again and again. There is some engine building, but it's so minor it really doesn't even deserve a mention.

Add to that the problem that there is zero player interaction or turn angst in Shipyard. You can always do something productive on your turn, so there isn't even mild blocking involved. During the game you couldn't care less what the other players are doing.

Only thing that saves Shipyard from being a 1 is that it isn't broken mechanism-wise (apart from the wildly uneven secret goals and the fact that the game is based on the always disastrous design philosophy "lets add mechanisms just for the sake of getting tons of mechanisms crammed into the same game"). It is only broken in the sense that it sucks all the fun out of the gaming experience and makes you wish you got suddenly sucked into another dimension where Shipyards was never invented.

Choosing 3-3 aims is interesting, although it might happen that you have only one interesting combination (or, in worst case, you don't have any). Balancing the aims (speed, extras on the ship, money for extra actions, hidden aims) is interesting, the game is quite thematic for what it is (even if none of the rondels really support the theme as a mechanism). The action selection is like a variation of Puerto Rico-like games; it seems this mechanism is really necessary if you make a game about harbors.
All in all, a not too deep but fine game.

A repeat play years later did not create favorable moments in game play. This felt much more fiddly and stop and go than I remembered and I've put it up for auction. There might well be balance issues with the end game goals as well?

FIRST IMPRESSION:

One of my favorite first impressions of a game from Essen 2010.  This one has a unique rondel in which the actions rotate around the rondel based on what action was last used.  Each time you end up choosing an action behind someone, you earn $1 for each person ahead of you. As well, you collect $1 for every 3 empty spaces between action you choose and the next action on the rondel track.  There are also 3-4 other more typical rondels which are more static and you must pay money to move more than one space forward unless you have the right special tile.  I really enjoy building a ship - has a great feel of seeing something come together as well as sending it out on a maiden journey and building your ship with the possibility of crossing over special bonus spots on the canal!  Lots of moving parts to this game that is well interwoven - I think there are multiple approaches to winning this game.  Do build ships keeping your goal cards in mind, however - failure to do so will end in a certain loss!

RATING: 7
This game is somehow odd: it is certainly well designed, the mechanisms function and there is all the time the feeling that there are more things one wants to do than actions available. And it is also pretty close. However, it just does not click with me. Maybe because of lack of direct interaction, maybe it's just too many unnecessarily complicated mechanisms and tiles & tokens. Well, it just did not manage to generate enough tension with me for the time it takes to play it. But maybe it will become better with further plays...

WOW. This is one major lake of choices and options.

While the end game goals are significant they do seem balanced so far. There is a seemingly unending number of ways to accumulated points and bonuses, though overall you do have to obey your end game contracts in order to win.

While there are 5 rondels, there is truely only one, though it's much more complex than any other that has come before; the selectable actions move to the "front of the line" changing their order, affecting availability, and finally serve as a timer for each round - PHEW!!

The other 4 rondels are neutral, and while you have to be mindful of them to time your primary actions from the main rondel properly, they are not something you control in a way as to thwart other players.

This is truly a game of efficiency, organization, and impeccable timing.

Looking forward to MANY more plays. The only down side to this game is time (2-3 hours, 30-40 minutes to explain the rules properly), and the 4 player cap (thank god it cannot play more :) )

More thoughts:

It's a tough call but I have to give Shipyard the nod this month. I'm a sucker for a rondel and this game has FIVE OF THEM.

They're not quite rondels in the way we think. Really it's all about the main rondel and simply timing the actions on it with the position of the neutral markers on the "sub-rondels". You can pay to move the "sub-rondies" further along, so in a way I [i]guess[/i] they are more akin to the "traditional" rondel....enough of the quotations already. The main rondel has actions that correspond to each of the other sub-rondels as well as 3 other piles (ship pieces, map pieces, train cars). After people move off of a space they chose in a previous turn this space ROTATES TO THE FRONT OF THE ROW! You cannot choose the action again (though there's a way to buy an extra action each turn to break this rule). There are a limited number of spaces on the main rondel and once the action spaces have advanced full circle it triggers the start of the next round.

Pile on the fact that there is ship building, then sailing said ships on a test run when they are completed, and even further that the ships have features on them (life preservers, lanterns, etc) printed on them plus ones you can manually add (different types of crew and passengers, masts, etc), and also also wik that the tiles that you use to create your route to sail contain triggers for some of said multipliers.

The real crux of this game is the fact that you start with 2 contracts in each of 2 groups/colors. At one point you have to choose one of each group. These contracts have conditional VP on them as well that score at game end.

It is long, tough, heavy, complex, and not easy to learn....but SO worth it if you're into heavy games and/or the rondel.

RATING: 6
In this game, you are taking different actions each turn to build ships.  You are trying to collect cards which enable you to complete the ship and launch it.  There is a set collection aspect to the game in that you score more if you have certain types of things on your ship.  

It is OK.  I suppose the odd looking ships put me off on this game.  Overall, it has some challenge to it, but I am not anxiously waiting to play again.

The action choosing mechanism is clever, although that too involves small fiddly cardboard chits.

MANY THANKS TO MY BGG SECRET SANTA!  Way too long is about the only complaint I can come up with.  Love the different rondels and the building of mighty ships.  I think the sweet spot for this game would be no more than 3 players, because even with just 4 it took us more than three hours to finish our first game.  Granted, half of the players were first-timers, so that did slow things down quite a bit.  Still, I can't see myself turning down another go at this fine game.

Excellent game, I enjoy it mostly with 3, just works flows quickly. I love the whole building and planning aspect of it, my only complaint is that its over to quickly (mostly around 100 minutes with 3 players). Sometime the contracts can feel a bit unbalanced but I hope as we play it more we will learn how to take advantage of most of the contracts. Though some contract that are open ended tend to feel more powerful because there is no upper limit to how many points they can generate. Excellent game, always looking forward to playing it again.. the only thing that could make this a better game would be if it was set in space and I was building space ships instead! but thats just me.. :)

Interesting game with a lot going on. The action selection rondel with its shifting mechanic and incentives to take less used actions is something I've not seen before. 

My score is driven down by two things. 

One, the game lends itself to interminable analysis. There are so many choices on every turn, many of them not well integrated into one another, that each turn can take a very long time. In a four player game, this is simply excruciating.

Two, the set up time is extremely long. There are an inordinate number of bits in this game. This isn't the end of the world, but it is somewhat of an annoyance.

Update: I played this a second time with two other players and enjoyed it far more than I did the first time. It's off the trading block.

In my opinion it suffers from the same problem as Le Havre: Too many mechanics inserted into a game that could have been much more streamlined.

The complex set of Rondells with a very annoying blocking mechanism makes it AP hell.

The contract are unbalanced. period, nothing will convince me otherwise. It completely destroys the game for me.

even after more tries, I just wanted to rush the game to the end.

I've heard that this has so much going on that it should be split into two games! In spite of this, I'm very much looking forward to playing it. I've loved the Mac Gerdts rondel system since Imperial, and as Shipyard is rondels-on-steroids, I should be pretty happy. Despite the smallish box, you get a lot for your money - 8 sheets rammed with counters that are very attractive, though it's taken me over an hour just to punch them. I've bagged everything up and I can just about get the lid on!!

This was a heavily anticipated game for me and I enjoyed my first play a fair bit. It's rondels upon rondels which is a neutral point for me. I enjoy the balance between engine building, general scoring (building any ol' ship), specific scoring (building a ship tuned for specific scoring goals that apply to this round), and endgame scoring (tailoring ship size and attributes to secret goals).

I'm not sure I'll get my hands on this as it is difficult to find and expensive, and I question how often I'll actually get it to the table. But I need to play it again for sure. It may be a con game for me. But it is pretty great.

The personalised construct-your-own points map is inspired, the boards are beautiful, the sheer number of options available is mind blowing, yet gameplay is elegant, and building ships is fun! Not rated a 10 due to the sheer length of the game, but fabulous nonetheless.

Long game that is pretty intense and has a lot of choices.

There are 5 rondels. First rondel determines which actions you take and the rest allocate resources. You want to build ships and set them sail, scoring points when they pass by scorable spaces.

Sounds fun, but also long (2 hrs) and intense.

Shipyard sounded interesting when reading about the game. Select actions in a kind of rondel mechanism to build a ship and eventually sail it in a canal to score. But the scoring is such a point salad (score for parts, equipment, crew, canal symbols etc.) that the actions never felt restricted and the game never tense. I'm sure there is a strategy on how best to solve the puzzle but this kind of solitaire optimization game simply is not my cup of tea.

Players are ship builders, taking one of 8 available actions, which circulate around a rondel to pace the game. Players construct ships, which have various speeds and need to sail test cruises to earn VPs. You are dealt 6 bonus tiles, in which you will only keep 2 at the end of the game.

The mechanics are interesting enough. Here's what I don't like: 1) The bonus VP tiles range is too great, and if someone gets a good bonus tile, you will be hard pressed to make up the difference, 2) There is no way to compensate people who go later in turn order, 3) Not all action tiles are going to be used equally, and that means you might be the only one pursuing one action, and you actually want other people to take the action so that the goods you want become available. 

There is a way to be efficient, taking rails, then selling the rails at the market, so that might make those actions harder to take. 

It's okay, but games will take at least a couple of hours, and the unfairness of the bonus VP tiles at the end could easily decide the game.

RATING: 5
I love ships. I love worker placement games. I thought I would love shipyard.  I did not.

I think what I disliked most is that every turn, there are several actions blocked from other players that I cannot perform. I know there are ways around this by getting employees that help you perform the action you wanted while performing an action that was not blocked this turn.

I know I enjoy other worker placement games where the board "resets" and you get a fresh chance to put player tokens on unblocked spots, and I realize that you may become blocked and not be able to do what you wanted.

Understanding these things, I guess I just did not enjoy Shipyard because it never seemed to "reset" as explained above.

After three games (2 with 4 players and 1 with 2), I think I can now comment properly on the game.

The gameplay hits a really sweet spot with me. There are a lot of things interacting (more so than the players, but that has never been a problem for me) and I find it quite fun figuring out how to build your ships to maximize the bonus cards you are dealt.

Unfortunately, I am almost convinced that the bonus cards are extremely unbalanced, both by themselves and when received in combination.

If you have read or heard anything about Shipyard, I'm sure it's been about the rondels or the 32-point bonus card. I have talked to Vlaada Chvatil (spelling?) of Czech Games about my concerns, and he assures me that experienced players can overcome the 32-point card (which you get for launching 6 ships) by building fewer, but bigger and better-scroing, ships. I'd like to believe this, but my experience tells me otherwise.

Many of the bonus tiles max out at as little as 12 points (such as the one for 7+ size ships - if you build 2 of them, you get the maximum 12 points). Even some of the ones that don't max out (bonus for life preservers, say) have a realistic limit and another limit as the tiles you need may not be available or other players may be going for those same features. Also, other tiles may have synergy with the 32-point tile (like the one that scores 6 points for each ship with a propeller, sail, and smokestack). Sure, every ship of the six you build may not have all these features, but completing 3 is quite easy. That's 50 bonus points. As mentioned many of the tiles have a hard to soft limit of about 12 to 16, so even maxing out both tiles will only net about 32 points. The scores before bonuses is almost always going to be less than 18 points (usually more like 5 to 8) so the 50-point bonus is almost a guaranteed win.

The fact that the game is still hovering around an 8 despite what I perceive as a HUGE problem with the bonus tiles is a testament to the gameplay. I hope the Czech Games guys can acknowledge what so many groups are experiencing and offer some changes or new tiles.

Eat your heart out, Mac Gerdts -- here's a game that features 4 rondels! And then a Glen More-style action selection system. There are a ton of rules to get through before the game can be played, but it all fits together incredibly well. IMO, I think this one should be up there with Ora et Labora, Agricola, Caylus (i.e., top 30 euro)

The engine-building part (worker tiles) is not that significant, so it all comes down to yet another game of a fixed number of identical rounds without any kind of a story arc, like we've seen so many times these past two years. In other words, it's too long.

The action selection mechanism is very clever: You always want to do something not currently available. But the game really is only about building ships from tiles and scoring the ships based on the tiles used. That just isn't very interesting, not even with the help of the action selection mechanism.

Definitely needs a tackle box, otherwise the setup is a pain.

O.K. first impressions... the theme is a little off kilter,  it has five roundels (which never really represent much in real terms, rather just a handy way of spacing actions) and it has a long and fiddly set-up/tear down, but it's a really nice looking game and it flows well once you get the hang of what's going on (thanks to the five roundels). And it's fun. I did feel towards the end that I might want to get out a pen and a bit of paper to remind myself what actions I needed to take to launch a final decent ship, but overall it's a good game with much to explore.

A very good gaming concept, to me, BUT

RATING: 4
A rondell game with an element of worker placement (the action selection). The game is very long for what it is (3-4 hours), should have been 60-90 mins ideally. 

There're no real scoring 'bombs' to the game - maybe the final scoring for the secret chits, but you work towards those gradually. If you don't sail this turn, you could always sail next turn. All the things that score you bonus points are equivalent - ship part#1 gets you bonus points for driving over icon type #1, whereas ship part#2 gets you bonus points for running over icon type #2. The game would have been improved by some differentiation here. 

The gameplay is very flat, meaning that near the end you are still focusing on doing the same things you were doing near the start, so it gets repetitive. Boring theme and boring mechanics (for me) I'm afraid.

Excellent game. There are 7 available actions in the game which you use turn by turn to collect bits of everything you need to build ships - bows & sterns, different types of crew, sails, propellers, etc. And within each action there is cheap stuff and dear stuff, so you need to balance your need for something in particular vs the cost. The needs come from the VP drivers which are three-fold - your overall objective cards which will want you to build ships a certain way (many, or big, or lots of cranes, etc), plus the speed and attributes of the ship, plus the bonus point drivers you choose via the canals you pick up. There’s a lot to juggle and gradually bring together at the same time, a lot of considerations on how to build ships, and a lot of tradeoffs with your actions. The user interaction is very limited, but vital. You can't take the actions they've taken since your last turn, which can make for hard decisions on what to do next, and they can beat you to things you want, so there's tension if you need something badly. Thankfully there's so many things you need to do there's almost always something useful available. And if you go a money strategy you can get out of any action hole by spending big to take a bonus action. Turns are fast. It's satisfying to score your ships when they're completed. Decisions are delicious throughout. My one hesitation is that there are so many things to acquire for each ship that it may start to feel like work, but I'm looking forward to exploring further.

Okay game marred by long set up time and too many small pieces. 2 player game is about 2 hours, which is an hour too long for the very repetitive nature of turns. You do not care what your opponent is doing. Can't see it getting out very often because of length, fiddly parts, and the set up time. Took 2 hours to punch and sort. Very dry, very solitaire, too many rondels, and the worst meeples I have ever seen. They constantly fall over due to uneven and narrow bases. each game will be different due to random set up and contract cards. I thought trajan was fiddly, this is a lot worse.

I thought I would really like this game, you take actions in order to build ships and send them off. There is almost no player interaction, except for the action taking mechanic, where only one player can be on an action and thus you can only chose it if no one else has chosen it. Otherwise, you take your actions and build your ship trying to get as many points as possible and focusing on your two secret contracts to get extra points at the end. The contracts do not seem very balanced and it becomes more difficult to win if you get a tougher one.

I'd describe this game as "set collection on steroids".  Each player is trying to assemble a fleet of ships by collecting hull pieces, on-board equipment, and crew members, as well as maps and bonus tiles that give you special abilities.  However, you can only choose actions that someone else didn't just take, and are given extra money for taking one that hasn't been taken in a while.  Taking an action will either let you buy items on a sliding cost scale, or move a marker on one of the game's many rondels to get an item.  Because each player received secret goal tiles in the beginning, everyone will be trying to construct their fleet in different ways.  This game is both deep and intricate, and should be a winner among fans of meaty games.

Based on one 3-player game: Nice artwork. Thin theme. Lots of different 'game-mechanichy' ways of accumulating resources and of scoring. Long setup. Drags a bit on. No narrative arc: always same pace and actions. Low player interaction. Unbalanced final bonus cards.

Really great rondel game. There are like 4 or 5 different rondels in this game. Some worker placement and a bunch of planning and puzzles to solve. 

Ron and I just learned it today so I am very excited to get in more games to see where it might lead. We know there might be concerns regarding balance issues but I think we can figure out a way for that not to be an issue. It is really a great game.

There's nothing really new in Shipyard and I worry that the contracts are too important. I fail to see how one can take significant advantage of the shared elements of the game so it seems to be most about who can best exploit their contracts. Which are hidden. I think it plays best with 2 as you are less prone to random screwage by other players (in 2p, it is usually intended screwage) and I would like to play it some more to see if my fears are justified, so it gets a 7 for now.

In this game players are competing by building boats, and then taking those boats for a sail down a path made up of your own personal canal tiles. The game has several different roundels used for action selection, which provides a lot of player interaction as you need to time your moves to capitalize on where other players leave the roundels. This is a really nice way of keeping you engaged in other player's turns. The game gives you several endgame victory cards at the start, and as the game progresses, and as your strategy crystallizes, you slowly discard them down until at the end when you are left with only two. This is another fantastic way of giving the players flexibility in their strategies. It's also one of those delightful games where at the end you can look at what you've built and feel good about it, even if you didn't win.

RATING: 6
In the game you are trying to build a fleet of ships (hence Shipyard) by collecting hull pieces equipment and crew members of which one captain is most vital since you can score any points without one.  
What you can select is driven by selecting actions in the mode of Kraftwagon. This mechanism is better implement in Shipyard with money bonus and the ability to buy an action. The actions are either draft style items showing up most costly and becoming less costly as others are bought, or multiple roundels where the item rotates based on last selected. After an arduous process you ship is ready and you launch scoring points based on the equipment your sea trial tiles want. You also have secret scoring tiles that will score at the end of the game. 

A heavy duty optimization game. There is a lot of considerations and intricacies. Expect your first games to be figuring out how all the levers work. The theme holds well to the game, I did feel I was building something.

This game is one of my favorites.  It is not too tense that you feel like you're out of the game if you make one mistake.  The tension is just about perfect.  On each turn you have many options for what to do next.  The rondels also make the game very exciting.  When should you pay to move a rondels a little further?  When should you be content getting only one resource?  I also love all the components in the game.  This game is tons of fun to play!

Rondels upon magnificent rondels! A bit intimidating at first, just from the sheer number of choices available.

I am a fan of almost every Suchy title, but this might be his best.

This is not a game that you will understand well after one play. There is a lot to think about, and it helps to get familiar with some of the cards. The only player interaction is to take opportunities that your opponents wanted, and I'm not sure if it's really possible to do that constructively, so it may come down to multi-player solitaire with a fair amount of player chaos. With two players the chaos is minimized, but it's not bad with three or four either.

RATING: 8
You build ships then take them for show cruises to score. But this one is not chaotic, it is deep and very economic. There are rondels for action selection, tradeoffs between opportunism and going for the massive scoring ship, and plenty to think about in general. As good as the game is, it feels like there is too much going on at times, making it hard to pick a strategy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The theme sounds great and everything should work in theory but it's not as enjoyable as I expected. The rondel system is a bit repetiative and it seems there is a huge amount effort to predict the system which is basically calculable, only thing that mixes the thing is who takes and what items before you. There is some debate about the balance of contracts, I didn't find as a problem, rather that player interaction isn't that interesting. The rules take a huge amount of time explain even though the game itself is quite easy to play. This is huge problem if you are playing with new players. The playing time also is quite long compared to the quite repeative nature of the game, seems like it takes closer 3 hours or even more. Interesting game but with too many downsides that I didn't want to hold on to my copy.

(+) Rondels everywhere, but they work :) The rondels make for some tactical opportunities

(+) The game involves some strategic planning in building the right canals and making the right boats (speed, items) to pass through them. The two goal tiles you keep add to the strategic aspects of the game

(+) Building the perfect boat for your setup actually is rather satifying

(+) Action rondel works good to drive the game forward in an interesting way. It creates opportunities and it also takes some opportunities away

(-) The game is filled with tiny bits and pieces. The whole feels rather dry.

(-) Minor point: I think it's a shame that player order doesn't change while playing. If you are stuck behind a player with a destructive strategy to always take money when the money action doesn't lay totally in front of the other actions - this could harm your play.

(-) In the final rounds, most actions have become quite useless, leaving too little good possibilities open to players and resulting somewhat in an anti-climax.

A lot of moving parts that overwhelms when one first sits down at the game.  Fortunately, the initial contracts help to narrow one's focus and then as the game develops, one concentrates and adapts the strategy that should yield VPs.  So in a sense a bit Agricola-like - contracts instead of occupations, resource management though action competition.  A nice game of building up resources than using them to effect with the sailed ships.  I suspect familiarity with the contracts will lead to more defensive play as one tries to interfere.  Need to decide if it is more valuable to build more smaller ships or a few larger ships.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
After (I must emphasise) only one play my impression is of an unnecessarily complicated, fiddly, solitary, and surprisingly unthematic game, in which the result of each already constrained action was too marginal and subject to too many forces outside my control for me to begin to form any kind of strategy or even successfully achieve any short-term plans. Trajan or any of Feld's 'point salad' games are far better than this IMHO.

Fairly fun, but sadly fails to do much with the rondel idea and fails to feel very fresh.  Certainly willing to play another time or two.

UPDATE: Still not the best use of the rondel mechanic, especially with the available ways to shortcut past its restrictions, but was reasonably fun if a bit long.  I do like how the government contracts (hidden victory conditions) made this game feel a lot different than the last.  Probably my favorite part of the design.

--Apr2010-- I've just read the rules; it appears to be a modestly involved game of manipulating two levels of rondels.  I think I'd want to print a player aid that reminds one of the ship scoring:  that's not quite clear enough without a bit of reference.

Well... this is just a terrific economic multi-rondel game. A disciplined theme makes it easy to follow. A great challenge with just so many options each turn. I really enjoy a game with this depth that's easy to play and comes in at less than 30 minutes per player.

Players are multiple rondels to choose resources, special buildings and crew from. All the while they're looking to build sections of their ships from a constantly changing layout of ship parts. To which they can add further ship parts. Before all this building gets too serious players will have chosen their route to sail and will have customised their ships accordingly to maximise profits.

The game is only let down my the bonus point tiles. Sure, they're a great idea to give players different goals and make it harder for opponents to calculate scores mid game, but, and it's a big disappointing but, they're so imbalanced that they kind of screw up all the beautiful work the game has done up until you score them. The designer has obviously tried to rectify any issue by giving players a good choice at the beginning of the game to whittle down to your best choice, but it's not enough.

Other than the bonus tiles the game is just top notch. It plays quickly with experienced players and is extremely engrossing. At the end of the day I find myself just enjoying playing it and not worrying too much about the score.

If you like the Mac Gerdt's rondel mechanic, this is your game, cause it has not one or two, but five of them. Around those, there is a light heavy Euro in which players try to get sets of different ship parts and crew members in order to score points. The theme is not only original, but also incredibly convincing. The rate could be even higher, but the game lenght takes it down a little bit.

Shipyard is fiddly as hell to set up, and a lot of fun to play. We have tried two and three player games. Whilst the game does feel, in parts, as though it has been made complex purely for complexity's sake and I am still not sure how balanced the goals are, it is one I keep going back to.

Good game.

Maximum 4 játékos, hosszú előkészületek, elnyúló szabálymagyarázat, kicsit kiegyensúlyozatlan titkos célkártyák, kis interakció. Ennyi negatívumot tudtam csak összeszedni a Shipyardról. Minden más pozitívum. Nekem tetszik a kivitelezés, minden elem teljesen jól néz ki, abszolút nyelvfüggetlen, korrekt ikonozás. Egy nem könnyű eurogame-ről van szó, ami mégsem száraz a témája miatt, amit szépen megoldottak. A játékosok hajókat építenek a gyáraikban. Jól látni, ahogy készül a hajónk, egyre több különböző elem és ember kerül fel rá és végül kifut, ami után tesztelés fázis jön. Érdekes a hajó útjának belevétele is játékba. Minden szükséges elemet különböző rondellás megoldásokkal tudunk megszerezni. Nyersanyagokat is gyűjthetünk, amivel két kör alatt tudunk több elemet beszerezni, de megoldhatjuk egy kör alatt is kevesebb tartozék begyűjtését. Rengeteg mindenre kell figyelni, de pont emiatt nagyon sok út vezethet a győzelemhez. Rövid, gyors hajók, hosszú, jól felszereltek, kabinokkal teli vitorlások, nagyon változatos lehetőségek. Nekem legjobban az egyes akciók kiválasztásának mechanizmusa tetszett. Talán kicsit túl sok mindenre is kell figyelni, de több játék után már jó stratégiákat is ki lehet dolgozni. Korrekt játék.

It's rondel bukkake!

Just when you thought you've had enough rondel action, here's some more rondel for your face!

It's a fine enough game, but it takes a lot of actions to get anything done.  So it feels like everything you do takes so much time and effort.  A big trudge.  

It works, but it just takes too long to get to the fun part of sailing off your boats on the little map you are creating. The super power employees are fun, but the rest of the game is so repetitious. Players all do their own thing dictated to them by their secret contracts over and over again and occasionally, inadvertently get in each other's way.  Oops, didn't mean to block you, but I guess that's good.

Not only do I think that the contracts take the joy of exploration out of the game (they are worth far too much to ignore), I also am surprised by how imbalanced the numbers are.  Had anyone playtested these?  If I were sucked into playing this again, I'd suggest we lay out six random contracts (three of each color) and everyone gets to go for those.  That way it scales, it has more public interaction and no one gets the super powered ship one to themselves.

A game made in rondel heaven, I guess.  I enjoy it, but have only played it two players and I'm wondering if I'll like it with the longer game length with three or four players.  I enjoy the theme of the game and ship construction is quite realistic, but I'm not sure that I think this game is amazing.

UPDATE: It's still fun but WAY too long with 4.  I really enjoy the two player game, but it's just isn't nearly as good with four.

2 plays, 3 years apart.

A game of rondels, set collection, tile laying (teeny bit), auctioning, and timing. Fun!

Three years was definitely too long between plays! This was a very fun game, probably one of the best I played at this TBGT! I enjoy the rondel mechanism, where you take small actions in a specific sequence. They're really almost micro actions -- you have to decide what to do, then do it over several turns. This game is a game of rondels (and set collection, tile laying, auctioning, and timing). 

The main rondel (random order initially, then based on player choices) is where you choose which action to take. Unlike most rondels, though, you may choose any action (except the one you were on last turn); and the further back you go, the more cash you earn. Most of those actions correspond to other rondels (or at least displays) where you can buy or acquire a variety of technology (to modify rules or actions), or ship-related stuff like hulls (with a variety of features), crew, propellers, sails, smokestacks, etc. You also acquire little tiles with rivers and icons on them -- use to build a little test track river for the boats you build. Eventually, you finish building the hull, add equipment and crew, and send your boat on a test run on your little river. The various additions determine the speed of your boat, which sets the distance traveled along the test river and give you VP. As you go, you pass over icons which may give you VP as well (depending on what's on your ship). 

Each lap around the main rondel is one round; the game ends after one round/player. At the start of the game, everyone gets a hand of VP cards. Part way through the game, everyone must discard all but two for their end-game VP. These contracts have wide-ranging VP values, which are added to points earned during the game. Others have complained about imbalanced final contracts, and Dan had the one that's apparently the worst offender (he chose to ignore it and do something else). 

This is a very enjoyable game with tension in the Glen More-like action selection, set collection, and multiple rondel goodness! I hope it's not another 3 years before the next play!

I like the game but it takes a bit too much time. The action selection mechanism is new but it doesn't work very well. The building system is cool and the theme is also cool. The long strategy doesn't work - it's not possible to make long distance plans because we can't control the available actions.

My fave game played at Essen 09. 4 Rondels to contend with, lots of paths to victory and a great action selection ability.

2nd play not satisfactory. A vit anti climactic and i prefeered it 2 player to 3 player.

3rd play v unsatisfactory! Evident that the bonus tiles bring the end game down to  a luck fest. Needs a drafting variant.

Now not my fave Essen game - thatis between Dungeon Lords, Hansa Teutonica and Vasco

RATING: 9
An excellent, balanced game with many paths to victory and a sweet balance of overall strategic planning mixed with tactical adjustments based on the other players' actions.  It strikes a balance between interaction and autonomy--every action you take has direct influence on the other players, but there is little in the way of personal screwage--it would simply be too costly to lose a turn just to harm another player.  It's thematic and anything but dry, but it does run long--especially the first playthrough if you're punching pieces (there's a gazzilion) and going over the rules.  That said, this is quite possibly one of the easiest to play games with this level of complex interaction.  With more plays it could easily end up a 10 for us.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Heavyish economic game known in these parts as "that one with all the rondels". Despite the large number of components, it isn't a complex game. Several of the actions work in the same or similar ways, but on different rondels -- not in the Mac Gerdts action-selection sense, but market pricing mechanisms: it isn't difficult to buy whatever you want, but if the marker is in the wrong place, it's more expensive.

It's very much a game of timing and efficiency. Actions are semi-exclusive, worth a variable amount of money, and of course are more or less valuable depending on the state of the markets at the time. Secret goals make the incentives different for each player.

Simultaneously my favourite and least favourite aspect of the design is that there's nothing particularly exciting about it -- it's a simple, solid game that doesn't rely on clever gimmicks. On the other hand, it's unexciting, and because it's a game of incremental efficiencies in production, nothing much happens fast. Getting anything done is a hard slog.

That wouldn't be a problem with an experienced group, without AP, but it just isn't exciting enough if you can't get it done in the advertised 30 minutes per player (or less). 

I just had a four player game last night that took about four hours including explanation -- it would better with fewer players and faster players, certainly, but I still think I'm going to have to let this one go. It's not interesting enough to risk another marathon grind for.

RATING: 6
This is a good enough game to play.  I'm not quite sure it's as rewarding as it should be for the 2+ hours it takes to play -- and if I'm not sure, there's very little chance I'll find others interested.  But I'm glad I got to play it once.

Not bad.
Build your ships from scratch, get equipment to make it better, hire captain and crew, and finally demonstrate it to the masses.

What i don't like is it has too many parameters to take care of. This isn't usually bad, but i feel some things are there just to be there and don't add something to the enjoyment.

Enjoyed 2 player game which lasted an hour (7 rating)  However,  a four player game took 2 hours and 40 minutes.  After 1.5 hours I was getting the feeling that I was just repeating the same actions everyone one else was completing and hence was not enjoying the game (4 rating). Interaction was largely accidental and hence frustrating at times. I would play again but only with 2 players.  Very fiddly game with a lot of fiddly rules.

as the rules are now this is a five.  It has the same problem I have with agricola and caylus.  players lock up actionns so that you have NO planning capability.  You must do the best you can when it gets aroud to your turen.  so you sit there waiting to figure out what you are oging to do.  I even herad someone say..... "I need to do three things over the next half hour so I shoulld write it down so ican remember.  However so much of the game is right down my alley.  a small house rule could fix this.... by allowinng a second perosn to take the action if it cost money.

They could have called it 'Longships': a long time to punch the bits, a long time to setup, a long time to play. OK - punching tiles was a one off (I'm [i]almost[/i] over it now), and a first play tends to accentuate setup/play time issues so we'll let that ride.

The game itself was pretty involving, although with a tendency to solitaire play until you get familiar enough with what's going on to look up and start considering what other players would like to do. Lots of ways of scoring, lots of ducks to get in a line before your ships go cruising. Don't fail your Government Contracts - they’re very valuable. Maybe it needs some way to record how many times you’ve lapped the 50-point score track? Some of the tiles are pretty small for big, manly, hands. The cash is particularly problematic.

The government contracts pretty much ruin this game by being extremely imbalanced. Sometimes you will realize [b]at the end of the game[/b] that you never had a chance in the first place. That's a capital crime in game design I think.

It's even more frustrating because otherwise it's a great game. It's a lot of fun until the very end when everyone reveals his contracts.

Fantastic. Lots of resources to manage, lots of ways to score. Its a lot of fun building your different ships in different ways. A bit too many counters though! BUT, after several plays, we're consistently seeing a big imbalance in the bonus tiles. Its incredibly hard to compete with someone who gets better bonus tiles. I understand the theory that the worse bonus tiles go with things that score more points in game, but I'm just not seeing it.

Initial impression is that it is brilliant, and the ship-building theme really makes me want to keep coming back, but it just wasn't as much fun as I thought it would be.  Definitely need to test out with more plays.

In the end, it was just boring and too fiddely.  I didn't enjoy having to pause the game every time a ship was built to figure out how fast it moved, how many points it was worth, and moving it off to the side with all the pieces was just too much work.

RATING: 7
Unusual worker placement game with a shipbuilding theme. The object is to construct a ship comprising of available tiles, adorn it with crew and equipment, then run it along canals made up of other tiles collecting victory points along the way. The mechanism driving the game is reminiscent of Mac Gerdts' rondel games whereby pieces move around a circular track determining what action can be taken. In 'Shipyard' however there are several of these tracks (acquire crew, equipment, money etc) and players are also constrained by the actions taken by other players to use these tracks. Once a ship has been completed it is run along previously acquired canal tiles and scores points as it passed over symbols that match features on the ship i.e. if a business symbol is crossed points are scored based on how many businessmen and cranes are on the ship. There's a lot going on in this game and there are several moving parts, which can make it very difficult to plan a turn. The actual running of the ship along the canal doesn't really fit in too well with the rest of the game and actually feels a bit clumsy in a design sense. This is a minor quibble though and overall 'Shipyard' is a strategically complex and therefore challenging game to play.

Medium-heavy game with industry/nautical theme, it has a bit of everything; worker placement, tile laying, economics, rondel action...

Has about a million tiles and tiny markers - a board flipping incident with this one would be a total disaster.

RATING: 8
This rating comes at an early stage, but so far Shipyard definitely has captured my affection. Replayability is one of the games best features, however, as strategy and tactics change considerably depending on which bonus cards players select, so I'm guessing Shipyard will stand the test of time well. Watching Shipyard being played, it looked like a very comlex game, but everything is pretty straightforward once you dive in and play, at lest in terms of how the game works. Nothing is straightforward in terms of how best to use your actions, however, and that challenge is a big part of what I like here. For some reason, the many rondels in the game seem to mesh pretty well with the nautical theme. This is probably the deepest of the games from Nuremburg 2010, and one that I am so far enjoying a lot.

First Impression:

Another classic euro that works well, but lacks in interaction.

The absense of luck is a plus, and the game has a very enjoyable accomplishment feeling. The theme works well enough for me. The contracts mechanism works perfectly. The player rondel works well in combination with money, and forces tough choices that depend on the subtle interaction.

On the downside, the game has a lot of absurb mechanisms, including 5 rondels and canals that make little sense. It's also abnormally lenghty to set-up and pack-up. The most serious flaw however, is the absense of any serious interaction. It's half a step above multiplayer solitaire. Finally, the contracts are unbalanced, and even though you can always draft them, replayability is seriously hurt because of that.

To sum it up, it's another love-hate game for me. I hate it for the lack of interaction and boring set-up, but at the same time I love it for the perfectly balanced mechanics and sense of accomplishment it creates.

RATING: 5
There are games that can be called multiplayer solitaire, and then there is Shipyard.  The game is reasonably clever and well put together, but any interaction with other players is purely coincidental.  Even those happenstances don't have much real effect on the other players -- they are merely forced to dealy their intended action one turn and do something else (which they would do anyway) first.  There also isn't any real engine building going on -- other than some workers who can make you marginally more efficient at doing things (and barely recouping the action and possibly coin you spent to get them) you are largely doing the same things in the same amounts at the end of the game as you are doing at the beginning.  As such, there is no real progression to the game -- you just play for a while and then the game ends.  I'd play again (just as I played solo Agricola and Silverton a few times) just to get another look at the game system, but I feel no desire to own it and likely no desire to play any more than a few games.

Its easier to play than I was lead to believe, but it is just as fiddly.  I like the economy and the multifaceted decisions you are presented.  Each choice has implications on the economy, either giving gold away or receiving it and the relative values of each action on the main wheel is in constant fluctuation.  The predetermined strategies given with the hidden mission would drive me nuts if every game had it, but in this game it forces you to learn different styles of play.  The game really forces you to specialize in items, which makes it a game of pure efficiency.  Your opponents goals are so obvious, but blocking techniques will just lower your score as well.  Paying attention to your opponent will help you time your moves however, so you can't play in a vacuum.  The theme of building ships is pretty nice, and the reward of specialization creates some fun ships.  I do have a soft spot for efficiency in the realm of limited actions, and this basically defines that type of game.

My last game was a 1 point loss where it was the battle of life preservers vs. sails.  The two strategies were wildly different, but resulted in a epic finish decided by one point.  Wow, that was a memorable game.  If future games are similar to the last one this will be a favorite, but although I really dig the game I doubt it.

Those Czechs sure know how to make board games! I'm a fan of Rondels (e.g., Imperial) and this has 5 of them! The more the merrier. You have so many balls in the air to keep track of during this game, but it still manages to move at a decent pace (because of the Rondels). It's a game that is complex and long on one level, but remarkably simple on another level. As in any Rondel game, each turn is a simple matter of selecting one out of a few possible spaces and then executing a fairly simple action. It's only the sum of your many turns that weave an intricate tapestry of moves and alternative possible paths. There are so many roads not taken in a game like this that you can easily ponder what you could have done differently for a long time after the game is packed up and back on the shelf.

First off, let's mention the negatives... there are a lot of bits which can make it a little fiddly, and the rondel and purchase/sell tracks are a lot to keep track of, and there may be a game balance issue based on your individual end game scoring conditions.  

All that being said, I really loved this game.  It took the part of Galaxy Trucker that I liked, building a neat ship, and made it better... you actually can take time and be proud of what you build, and when you run your ship it actually feels like you are accomplishing things and they bolted on a full scale economic game on top of that with all sorts of interesting tough decisions that tie back into building your ship.  

I made the mistake of playing this with someone who prefers medium weight games and he just about went into anaphylactic shock.  And the gamer who enjoys heavier weight games didn't seem particularly thrilled either.  So it looks like another game I like that will just look pretty on my shelf.

[thing=55600][/thing] is an experience in rondels: after picking an action in the central row, usually you are lead to a rondel, were you move a pawn to collect some kind of resource (ship parts, crew, accessories, materials, test areas and the market, to sell stuff). It is a game filled with moving parts, quite fitting with the unique theme it carries, something Vladimír Suchý knows how to do pretty well (unique themes integrated with the mechanics).

The actions, by themselves, are very simple: move a paw and take what is beneath it, or connected to it; or pay to move the pawn a little further, in order to take something better for you; or pay to get better parts, materials or test areas. Straightforward, direct. But everything requires ponderation: due to the position of the pawns, to what is available in the market, to the place of the other players in the row of actions, and in great part because what you do this round you won't be able to repeat next round (except by paying). Therefore, not only is necessary to know what you want, it is also important to be well prepared to know [i]when[/i] to an action - timming is almost as relevant as to what is being done.

Interaction in the game is more indirect - the traditional fight for the same stuff with some blocking of actions and/or pieces. The variety in the game comes both from the random set up, and the set of goals each player receives at the start of the game. By the way, this is probably the best mechanism in an already good game: each person starts with 3 goals of one type and 3 of other. After each phase is completed, players are required to discard one goal of each type, until, by the end of the game, everyone will have one of each. A simple and elegant system (much as everything else in the game) that allows players to explore paths early on, without having to compromise too soon and going all in right from the start. Clever, efficient and it surprises me a lot that there isn't a huge amount of games that use the same mechanism.

Overall, [thing=55600][/thing] is a simple game when considered each part alone, but putting them together makes something greater than the sum of its parts - a complex structure, apt for long term strategy while open to tatics and opportunities. Recommended.

An interesting addition to the worker placement line. It had enough tension of accomplishing so many different tasks to get anything done without constantly fighting a losing battle (like Agricola or In the Year of the Dragon). It's freeform enough that you can go many different ways but still well balanced. The secret objectives aren't quite like in Metropolys where you can actively block against your opponents' goals if you deduce them, but rather just extra sources of points that are unique for you, a different method. It was a bit long after my one 4-player game, but it was definitely something I'd go back to.

Some people claim the game is balanced despite the enormous disparity in expected contract values. Well, maybe so, but I am not convinced by the arguments I have seen, and even if it is true it is ONLY true for very experienced players. Some contracts are trivial to get a huge number of points from - I got the 32 from the many-ships contract and barely had to think about the game at all. That's not good design.

Even if the contracts were altered to be better balanced, I wouldn't care for the game much. It's extremely repetitive, extremely abstract, and doesn't really offer anything new (all the key elements have been seen in other, more enjoyable games).

Smooth playing, but kind of bland. There's not much of an arc to the game, since you're essentially doing the same thing throughout, without the sense of progression and escalation of the similarly-themed Le Havre. Essentially this game boils down to a series of overlapping set- collection games - it feels light, and yet the play time suggests something much heavier. I feel like Trajan does this type of game better.

get points for launching ships.. (move ships and get points based on ship parts, speed determined by length) seems fiddly.. too many tiles.

RATING: 8.5
This game is really awesome.  I bought it on a whim, but I think I'm already putting it up as one of my favorite games.  There is certainly strategy in the game, but the real winning strategy is one that is flexible.  

Like Puerto Rico, this game can be quite frustrating at times.  Also, like Puerto Rico, it can go very fast with experienced players, but very slow with new players. I think that as people play this game more, it's rating will go up dramatically.  However, unlike Puerto Rico, I could play this game repeatedly without getting bored of it.  I don't really know why I'm comparing it to PR, since there are very few similar mechanics between the two games.  It just seems to fit.

I really think it should be one of the top 30 (instead of #255, as it is today).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Play feels a lot like Puerto Rico. Very tight game. Most of the strategy comes from the secret role cards (they score a large number of points and the game seems very much about maximizing the number of points that you get from them). The visual element of the finished ships with all their sails and cranes and guns and passengers is very cool.

A good euro game.  Unfortunately, that means it has lots of company, with little to distinguish it.  The theme is very reminiscent of [gameid=35677].  The gameplay is strong, but I'm just not really into the theme or artwork.  The general 'building stuff' principle is kind of neat, but I'm not so nuts on some of the other flash, especially getting canals and employees.  The main action track gives you lots of meaty choices. The good actions stay near the front, but take too many and you'll be broke quickly.  The worse ones stay toward the back, which means you can get richer, but sometimes your actions will suffer as a result.  This is a good game, but I fear it is simply one that doesn't appeal to my taste, and thus it will join a lot of its euro forebears as "Eh, maybe, but I'd rather play something else."

RATING: 9.2
Longish building game. Build lots of little ships, or go for that monster ship with every accessory under the sun that takes nearly the whole game to complete. If you like building stuff in your own little area, this is a game for you. Fantastic fun as you slide your finished ship into your personal area, a massive pile of cardboard all arranged and stacked properly, cannons on cannon mounts, sails on sail mounts, crew loaded into each cabin...

Really not that complicated, but the rules explanation took forever as the manual repeats everything multiple times to make sure you don't get it wrong, but the game goes faster once you know it. A neat rondel mechanism makes the actions constantly change in order, unavailable to be chosen if other players are on them, as well as making it more profitable to select certain actions over others.

I'm not a believer in the "contracts are broken" theory. The winner is the player who is most efficient in his actions, and best tailors his game to his contracts.

One of the best game with high learning curve on the strategy. This highly involved the objective tiles. The objective tiles would determine how you play the game and that's one of the reasons why the game is awesome.

RATING: 7.5
Played twice, both times with two players. 

Gameplay feels a little too dictated by the government contracts. However, with the exception of the fleet bonus (max 32 points for launching 7 ships), the contracts are pretty well balanced. 

There is something very satisfying about building ships and launching them down the shakedown.

"You know what would be fun? A board game with five rondels!" said no one ever. Tack on a bizarre canal building tile laying game and an equally strange tile draft for building the ships and you just have a ridiculous mess of disparate but interlocking parts. It should be a disaster, but once you get through a turn or two it starts to come together quite seamlessly. It turns out this is a very good game. The scoring is kind of ridiculous, jumping through hoops to make sure your boat has the proper number of anchors and port holes to satisfy the canal racetracks demands, but silly as it is the game does provide a surprising amount of depth.

RATING: 4
I really liked the rondel in Navegador, so when my friends told me this game has five of them, i was keen on trying it.
Here's the thing though.
These are really different rondels. In Mac Gerdts games the rondel limits your actions while in this game other people limit you, but not in the usual euro drafting/worker placement way where they want something so the game is about who gets there first, no, this game is pretty solitaire and other people sometimes randomly (at least it feels random) set the rondels in a way that's not good for you. There is some mitigation with money, 6 money buys you any main action, and you can pay to advance more than one step on the side-rondels, but still...
Half the time in this game anyone had their turn somebody said okay thanks for screwing me somehow. And it is not a take that game. It is just overcomplicated and thus chaotic.
The other thing is that the game relies heavily on is objective cards. So heavily in fact, that from your starting objective cards you select a pair that works well together, and just make that kind of ship the whole game multiple times. You also need to get canal cards which are essentially overcomplicated goal cards too.
There was very little sense of actually building something for me (but this one might be even more subjective, i can see some people loving to build the ships), because the ships feel more like set collection. It's something like this: "I got a captain, two lifeboats, a cannon and sails." But the main things is that these ships don't do anything, they are just there for your objective cards to get points.
There is very little engine-building in the game, you get some special ability tiles and that's it.
I said the game is chaotic, but in the end it doesn't really matter because it's balanced enough that you can do something good most of the time, but at the same time the goal cards do not seem balanced, at least when i won my first game, i got an "okay but those two goal cards are overpowered together " from the guy who taught me the game :D For example some goal cards give you 12 points max, others 32.

So a mix of overcomplicated mechanisms, set collection for goal cards and no sense of building. Some might like it, and I didn't hate it, but there are many way more interesting, elegant and variable games out there.

Enjoyed the game play a lot.  However, and this is a huge however, and will likely drive my rating downward, is that the bonus cards seem entirely unbalanced.  In my play, at the end of play, all four players were within 2 points.  Then, one player had a 32 point bonus cards, and no one else was close.

If this is truly the way the game plays out, then my rating will go down a lot.

After two plays I've got to rate this game an initial 8. This is like any other rondel game which requires timing, cash, player order, plate spinning (esp with 5 rondels). The contract cards are key to determine which direction you head. Do it early in the game and stay focused. So far have played with 3 but look forward to playing with 4 players when people know how to play the game. Cause it's long enough with 3 IMO.

It's no Arkham but there exist a monumental number of pieces for Shipyard, and after one play I can only really comment a fraction of them. Employee tiles make the game interesting by differentiating player roles a little bit, necessitating people to take notice of their opponents and guess at what actions they'll prefer; personally I'm no fan of the yellow accounting employees because (to use Magic terminology) they don't add card advantage persay, rather only virtual card advantage. The other aspects of the game seem self-explanatory after you play it first-hand and downright negligible when compared to the blue/green government contract cards distributed during initial setup. After looking at the back page of the rules pdf that lists the contracts, imbalance is a substantial problem. I'm actually surprised that 8 VP's per merchant/soldier/crane/cannon ship doesn't clobber with 3 VP's per soldier/cannon pair:

[b]8 VP[/b]
- 5 three-length ships (need C/C mounts)
- 25 pieces (5 M/S/C/C/C)
- Builder - Occupancy, Three Recruiter/Engineers
= 5 boats x 8 VP's
+ Contract value, also 5x8
= 80 VP's 

[b]3 VP[/b]
- 4 three-length ships (need cabin, cannon mount, one needs two of each)
- 30 pieces (13 S/C, 4 C)
- Builder - Occupancy / Cannon, Recruiter - Soldier, Engineer - Cannon
= 3 boats x 11 VP's + 1 boat x 14 VP's
+ Contract value, 13x3
= 86 VP's

3 VP actually comes out on top, with minus an action for shipbuilding, plus two for recruiting people, not including the fact he needs very specific pieces while 8 VP has a more reasonable split. Of course, ~40 VP's on the blue contract really schools the variety one that tops out at 15 as well as those that look for merchants, soldiers, and captains specifically. (Not doing the math for this one, but anyone hitting 21 soldiers over the course of the game? Disregarding that equipment is twice as valuable as a person?) I'm also suspicious of the extra actions needed to fuel the 4 VP per canal tile contract; I'm not certain the speed/safety bonuses balance out with the time investment, but hopefully soon I'll test that one first-hand, along with the 2 VP's per blue/yellow/orange employee contract + every trader + stuff boats full of cranes and cannons approach.

a decent enough euro game, with a terrible endgame mechanic.  you spend 99% of the game building ships and sending them on trials, and then in the final 1% of the game, the contracts that you have determine the final score... by a lot.  i could handle it, if they were moderately less likely to completely change the final ranking.  anyways, probably not worth the three hours it takes to play.

I like building the ships in this game and its neat to see your little fleet of finished ships at the end.  That being said it seemed like a game of many small moves capped in occasional larger moves.  While I appreciate the long term planning this made me do too many "I'll take this one dude" type turns got a little boring.  A faster group with less down time would mitigate this, but there are other games that keep you more involved off your turn that I'd rather play.

Playing Shipyard feels a lot like juggling balls (conceptually anyway, since I personally cannot juggle).  There are so many things you have to consider at any given moment and the trick is how to pull them off with the right timing and finesse.  A track with all the actions available serve as a timer that as the game progresses through each round and eventually signals the end.  Then depending on the action chosen, you (usually) have another part of the board you will have to move to take the ship parts, personnel, technology, resource or canal tile you desire.  All it boils down to in Shipyard is the ability to generate income with which you can buy more actions and build your ship efficiently.

What really impress me about this is how all the pieces come together to accomplish a goal that makes sense.  Plenty of games throw you tons of choices and options but more often than not the different mechanics do not integrate well with each other (take Masters of Venice for example).  So while there are a lot going on in Shipyard, each step you take and each decision you make will get you more VP, there never seems to be a wasted action (unless you did not plan accordingly).

Was extremely enjoyable the first few times I played it.  The problem with it is that the contracts tell you what your strategy must be, rather than allowing you to choose a strategy for yourself.  Even though you are given multiple contracts, it's usually pretty obvious which will yield the most points and it's silly to choose any contract other than that one.

As a result, even though the specifics of each individual game are different (maybe this game you want cannons where last game you wanted businessmen), the game feels exactly the same each time.

Update 7/2/2017:
My love for this game far exceeds the rating i'm giving it. Such a unique theme and feel. Last night i played a 2 player game (possibly it's best player count as it only lasted for 90 mins) and for the first time i managed to score big during the ships' shakedown instead of focusing all points for just the end goals. It paid off handsomely. Both in terms of points but also gameplay wise. The criticism i had with regards to the imbalance of the goals might have been premature. Love it!

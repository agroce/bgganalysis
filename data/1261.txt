I don't like tile placement games, so I could not be objective. I found it too mind-stressing, lacks of fun. And pesonally don't like those BIG wooden pieces (and colours).

Masterpiece among the semi-abstract games. A lot of tactics and a long term strategy to be adapted to your opponents strategies (flexibility) is also fundamental.

There is a nice combination of press your luck and puzzle/optimization going on.  Once built, the city looks fantastic.  I feel like the 3  player and 4 player games will play completely differently.

Medina is a tough game. I have only played it once, and didn't really have a clue until a decent amount of the game had finished. It's good but one that will be truly evaluated after a few more plays. I'm going to try and get this one to the table every other week or so until I can truly comment on it.

I love the look and feel of the wooden bits in this game. Really awesome as you see the entire city build up. It's a strategy game that is tough and competitive. You can smartly block others in brutal ways. There's lots of chicken feeling here too as you wait for opponents to make mistakes that will allow you to move in. It feels like a perfect information game that has perfect moves - even with the hidden pieces. So with an AP player, it would likely slow to an unbearable crawl. Still, if I saw it for a good price, I might pick it up. It was fun for a stylish abstract.

Juego con muchísimas piezas de madera, tablero, pantallas y 8 losetas de bonus. Se trata de construir entre todos, de forma abstracta, la ciudad de medina, colocando 2 piezas en tu turno. La clave, sólo tienes 4 cúpulas, y ningún palacio pertenece a nadie hasta que no uses una de ellas en uno sin reclamar. Los palacios se construyen entre todos, y hasta que no esté uno reclamado, tienes que añadirle piezas del mismo color, antes de poder empezar uno nuevo. También tienes que dejar "calles" entre palacios, por lo que no se pueden añadir piezas ni ortogonalmente ni en diagonal, si "cortas" una calle. El juego se puntúa al final por número de piezas de los palacios propios, añadiendo puntos  extras, como son los establos, estar limitando con murallas de la ciudad, o con las piezas de filas de personas que forman los zocos. También se premia ser el último en construir el último el palacio más grande de cada color, y el último en reclamarlo uno que conecte por muralla con una de las torres vigía. Un juego abstracto muy entretenido, curioso y bonito. 
3-4 jugadores y hay una variante para jugarlo a 2.

RATING: 8
An interesting and beautiful game.  Although there are elements of some other Euros in it, it still come sover as pretty original.  Essentially it's a brain-burning game of chicken.  Who will claim a palace first and thus risk having thos ewho follow get a bigger one?  And sometimes you have to play quite negatively, which I can imagine would annoy some players.  For me, that's ok and part of the attraction.  Sometimes it's hard to take your go and you don't really want to place what you've got: rather like some card game such as Hearts or Loco.  But, everyone else has the same problem and it's encumbant upon each player to play his pieces not just to do himself the most favours, but also to do others the least.

I'd imagine that with some players it could be prone to AP, but in my plays, I haven't seen that.

An interesting 3-4 player abstract in the style of Through the Desert.  The end seems a bit wonky: exactly how many palaces you have that you were unable to play seems to be extremely important and somewhat arbitrary.  Perhaps further plays will change this opinion.

There are some interesting things going on with the game in terms of placement, but there's a little too much "let's throw this out there and see if it sticks" for me.  Definitely some luck pushing involved.  I'd play again, but I'm not super excited about it.

Wonderful abstract game (with the theme just providing a nice setting), which used to cause furious deal making in our group, before we collectively decided to abandon that way of playing. Probably still our most played game, though certainly sees the table less often now that my collection has ballooned.

Absolutely solid components, building up a very substantial city. Agonizing decisions due to the forced play of two pieces each turn. The board seems so open when you first start to play, but you'll keep coming up with ever more devious ways to fragment palaces. Makes my head hurt in all the best ways.

At it's heart this is an abstract game with very simple rules. But the components and the theme really fit the game and add a nice feel to it. While the rules are simple the game has a lot of depth. You're always weighing the options you are presented by the previous player and you have to make difficult decisions all the time. The only downside is that an inexperienced player can inadvertantly throw the game to the next player in turn order by giving away a board position that's too good. Still, with equally skilled players this is an excellent and quick strategy game.

Medina is a Euro-abstract with beautiful wooden components and it shows as the city develops during gameplay. There are a lot of crunchy decisions based on spatial and timing considerations along with a lot of 'screwage' and blocking of other players.

Have played only using the two-person variant, and it works very well. I love the look of the game and the tension that builds on whether or not you claim a palace. 

I finally got to play with four and the thought that goes behind it is different when you don't have blocking domes.  Still was very cool and it gets more tense for me with four.

Dropped a point to 7.  Realize that I really enjoy this with two but enjoy less so with more than that.

Me lo descubrió Moriarty. Es un juego de ir construyendo una ciudad amurallada en la que hay cuatro tipos de palacios. En cada turno el jugador coloca dos piezas, para ampliar los palacios. Cuando lo decide conveniente coloca una cúpula que corona ese palacio, tras lo cual no puede seguir siendo ampliado. Un jugador al final acaba la partida con un palacio de cada tipo en propiedad. La puntuación final evalua el valor de cada palacio en función de la cantidad de piezas que lo componen y algunas otras que añaden puntos extra. Es un juego abastracto con bastante enjundia. El tablero al final de la partida es una preciosidad. Muy conseguido el tema de la ciudad árabe.
Recomendable. Las partidas son rápidas, algo mas de media hora. 

Lo compré a Ksuco en la bsk con 23 € mas kiala, en Enero de 2015, gracias a un aviso de Moriarty.

An unique game of city building. There can be tense anxiety when it's one's turn as your move will often help build the area up for the next player. How greedy would you like to be? Or should you just settle?

Beautiful, evocative abstract game whose mechanics, though solid, really do betray its age. This game feels like an older design. Although your decisions from turn to turn are interesting, there just aren't enough things going on in the game to make it very interesting.

I don't think I really "get" this game.  Maybe I'll pick up on the strategy with more plays.  It seems to have a "push your luck" element to it, as you have to hope someone doesn't take a building you've been working on before your turn comes back around.  I'm generally not fond of this type of push-your-luck.

Medina is a fine game which feels like it’s made by Knizia (which it isn’t). The reason is that the gameplay is very smooth and the scoring as well. I think the spatial element made the game interesting as well as when you decide to claim some of the buildings. The wall design is very clever too as is the small meeples you place and get points for (it’s cool that you can only build from both ends)! I liked that you could really obstruct and mess with the others in this game; it looks innocent, but it’s actually quite mean. It seemed that a player can get an advantage if he makes a trap pass, but in the end he didn’t win, so I guess it’s not really an advantage… We played with 4, and I would imagine that it’s extremely different (and better) than if we had played with two.

There are a few Dorra games with a similar feel to them. This one reminds me of Marracash for some reason. 

The components are beautiful, with LOTS of wood and interesting color choices. 

The actions are so simple....place two of your pieces on the board. The scoring is fairly straightforward. But the spatial element and dynamic scarcity of the pieces make the game become quite tense. 

All the information is trackable...but someone like me can't really keep all that straight, so the shields are useful. 

Sadly, I think this is another example of a game that I'd love to play more but won't find enthusiastic opponents.

It works, but it doesn't do anything that I like.

Basically this is an abstract tile placement game that happens to have very snazzy wooden bits in the box. The overall idea is a tension between claiming a palace, or adding to it and hoping no one else snags it in the meantime. 

The problem is that there are few good ways to actually enjoy this tension...the game seems to always make me feel that I'm choosing between bad options, and even though that's good in that it means the game is tough, it also means I don't enjoy it all that much either.

I think I would like this game more if there were more ways to actively thwart your opponents, but as it stands it is often very difficult to do so. You can start up a colour in an awkward spot and try to direct the conga line into inauspicious zones, but none of it really grabbed me in the least.

Workmanlike, and I would be willing to play again, but it doesn't speak to me.

Well designed and balanced game. Lots of room for planning. Very enjoyable middle weight game. I always like a game that simultaneously rewards short term tactics based on one turn's play while also requiring and rewarding long term tactics. I was just reviewing my comments on the games and felt this game deserved some more airtime so to speak. When I read my comments I realized they didn't convey the excellent strategies this game had. The whole game was enjoyable from start to finish. This game had me thinking right from the start and it was great fun to try and implement a gameplan. You are placing pieces into a city and trying to score points based on the areas covered. this sounds simple but the tactics are fascinating.

"Thanks guys; I couldn't have won without you."

Interesting game of city-building.  There's always tension between getting yourself more points and blocking your opponents.  Despite the screens, it's almost a total knowledge game, since everyone starts with the same pieces.  I like how the game is always moving forward, ticking off to the end.  The wooden components aren't *that* beautiful. <grin>

RATING: 5
Medina is a somewhat clever game of zugzwang coupled with positional manoeuvring. Players are forced by the rules to jointly erect palaces, claim them, and then put some finishing touches on them to increase their point value. It is interesting to see how the game develops. First there is plenty of room, so noone wants to give away too great a palace. Because sticking close to walls gives extra points, the first palaces are located there predominantly. But as soon as the board begins to fill up you can force new palaces to be erected in very inaccessible places where they will never grow to a useful or threatening size, although this is of limited use since an unclaimed palace which cannot grow any further is considered to be 'finished' meaning that a new one may be started elsewhere. It forces the players to burn through their pieces and turns the entire game into a counting excercise—provided of course you're sufficiently astute at keeping tabs about this. Despite their somewhat meager potential, the tactics and game flow are nice to see unfold.

In the end however I think there is too much zugzwang involved plus too much fear of doing something which will not profit you, but will profit the player coming after you; and too little incentive to strike out on your own. Walls, markets and stables are in fact ways to pass a turn, shifting the zugzwang onto the next player. Mastering the balance between these two aspects is not easy, so don't think Medina will yields its secrets after just a handful of games. Still, I vastly prefer games like Through the Desert and Go where the emphasis lies on how far you trust yourself to go, rather than preventing setting up positions other players will benefit from. There is much more give and take there.

[b]Update[/b] Let the game go to the house of a gaming friend where it will probably get a bit more love.

This game is quite interesting to play. Experience makes it a better game as you have a better idea of how to make the optimum placement of pieces and to judge better when to take possession of a palace.

Great looking game with wonderful chunky wooden pieces. Some devious strategies are possible here, but the game can really be spoiled by a less than competant player taking their turn before you.

Production: Gorgeous wooden pieces (just like the box says).  This is one of the best-produced games I've had the pleasure of playing.  The style choices turn the game from a wooden-blocked abstract into a city-in-the-making.  Play: I find the palace-claiming to be rather befuddling, and in the press-your-luck category.  Placing all the other pieces is very strategic, but with immediately-apparent results.  (3+1+3) (4 plays)

How can something with such simple rules and pieces be so evil and deep?  It looks beautiful and, though it sounds like a dry experience, is actually really compelling and engaging.  The only problem with the game is that often you feel like you're settling for the least bad option rather than picking a good option; otherwise it'd be a ten.

RATING: 8
 Sure it's an abstract game, but not dry at all. Very dynamic, and play well with 2 to 4 players.
My only complain: a weak player give easy point to the next player ( turn order ). It could be very annoying that your own error harms you a little but could give easy point to the same player. I have to minus my rating.
The game is still a gem when played with roughly even level players.

Médina est un jeu de pose aux règles épurées qui allie profondeur et esthétisme. Le but est de marquer le maximum de point en construisant de grands palais. Mais il y a d’autres moyens de gagner des points, être à proximité du marché qui sillonne la ville ou bénéficier des tours de guet.

Préparation

Placez les 4 tours ( qui rapportent de 1 à 4 points) aux 4 coins des remparts ainsi qu’un marchand au hasard sur une case du plateau.
Chaque joueur reçoit les pièces suivantes :
Un écran à sa couleur
4 toits de sa couleur
6 bâtiments de palais (5 à 4 joueurs) dans les 4 couleurs disponibles, soit 24.
4 bergeries (3 à 4 joueurs)
8 marchands (6 à 4 joueurs)
10 murs de remparts (8 à 4 joueurs)
Les toits sont visibles mais toutes les autres pièces sont dissimulées derrière l’écran.

Le jeu

A son tour le joueur place deux pièces sur le plateau, puis c’est le tour du joueur suivant.

Règle générale de pose : entre chaque palais il doit y avoir au moins une case de libre, les palais ne se touchent pas, même par un coin. Seuls les marchands de la file du marché, et le mur d’enceinte peuvent faire le lien entre deux palais.

Bâtiment de palais : s’il s’agit d’une couleur d’un palais en construction, il faut placer la pièce adjacente à un des bâtiments du palais en question sinon la placer sur une case libre. Un palais peut être adjacent à un mur.

Toits : un joueur peut poser un toit sur un palais, cela signifie
1- qu’il en prend possession définitivement
2- que la construction de se palais est achevée. Il est alors possible de commencer ailleurs la construction d’un autre palais de la même couleur.*
Attention : un joueur ne peut avoir q’un seul palais de chaque couleur. Si tous les joueurs ont un palais d’une couleur, les bâtiments de palais de cette couleur qui n’ont pas été posés sont immédiatement défaussés.
*N.B : c’est la variante française qui est due à une imprécision dans la traduction des règles. Dans la version originale il est possible de commencer un palais de la même couleur dés que le premier ne peut plus être agrandi, il n’est pas nécessaire qu’un joueur s’en soit emparé.


Bergeries : elles doivent être adjacentes à un bâtiment de palais. Ce sont des dépendances qui ajoutent de la valeur au palais auquel elles sont accolées. Elles peuvent être placées même si le palais est déjà achevé.

Marchands : un marchand est posé en début de partie et les marchands suivants seront posés à la suite de manière à constituer une file ininterrompue. Un nouveau marchand doit être adjacent à un des deux marchands à l’extrémité de la file, il ne peut pas être adjacent à plus d’un marchand. S’il est impossible d’agrandir la file existante, le joueur peut débuter une nouvelle file en plaçant son marchand sur une case libre de son choix.

Murs : un joueur ne peut jouer un mur que sur une case mur de l’enceinte de la ville, cet emplacement doit être adjacent à une tour (départ du rempart) ou être adjacent à un mur déjà posé (prolongement du rempart). Comme il y une tour aux quatre coins de la ville, il est possible que sur un même coté de la ville il y ait deux murs qui tendent à se rejoindre. Ces deux murs ne peuvent se rejoindre totalement, il faut qu’il y ait au moins un emplacement libre dans le rempart (une porte) sur chaque coté de la ville.

Attribution de bonus

Pour les bonus palais : le premier à prendre possession d’un palais d’une couleur prend le jeton correspondant. Par la suite si un autre joueur possède un palais plus vaste de la même couleur, ce dernier récupère le bonus. Les bergeries sont prises en compte dans la taille du palais.

Pour les bonus tours : le premier joueur à avoir un palais adjacent à un rempart prend le bonus correspondant à la tour de coin qui débute le rempart. Si par la suite un autre joueur possède un palais (la taille n’est pas prise en compte) relié à cette tour par un mur d’enceinte, ce joueur récupère le bonus en question. Il faut donc être le dernier à avoir un palais connecté à la tour, ce qui autorise plusieurs stratégies :
- prendre possession d’un palais
- allonger le rempart jusqu’à ce qu’il soit adjacent à un de vos palais
- placer une bergerie sur un de vos palais pour entre en contact avec le rempart
- et penser qu’une tour de coin est liée à deux cotés de la ville et donc à deux rempart

Fin du jeu
Les joueurs jouent leurs pièces tant que c’est possible, si ce n’est plus possible le joueur montre ses pièces et se retire de la partie. Le jeu se poursuit avec les joueurs restants. Lorsqu’il ne reste qu’un joueur, ce dernier est dans l’obligation de jouer au moins un toit par tour de jeu tant qu’il lui en reste. La partie s’achève lorsque le dernier joueur ne peut plus poser de pièces.

Les scores
Pour chaque joueur
Chaque bâtiment de vos palais = 1 point
Chaque bergerie adjacente a un de vos palais = 1 point
Chaque mur de rempart adjacent à un de vos palais (bâtiment + bergerie) = 1 point
Chaque marchand adjacent à un de vos palais (bâtiment + bergerie) = 1 point
Et on ajoute les éventuels bonus de palais et de tours.

Mon opinion
J’annonce tout de suite la couleur : Médina est un petit bijou. Comment qualifier autrement un jeu doté d’un matériel somptueux, de règles simples et logiques et à l’intérêt toujours renouvelé ?
Les subtilités du jeu viennent avec la pratique, mais ce qui est fort c’est que dés la première partie le débutant entrevoit des possibilités tactiques. Car contrairement à beaucoup de jeux abstraits la situation sur le plateau est facilement lisible, en grande partie parce qu’il n’y a pas à anticiper de déplacement. Les pièces posées restent définitivement à leur place.
Un aspect que j’aime énormément c’est la gestion du temps, savoir à quel moment il faut s’emparer d’un palais car si vous attendez pour lui donner davantage de valeur cela va tenter un autre joueur.La question maîtresse de Médina qui illustre bien son coté vicieux est la suivante: OK je joue, mais est ce que ce coup est réellement à mon avantage? Il y a de multiples façons de contraindre vos adversaires à faire votre jeu et il vous faudra de l’intuition et de la psychologie pour deviner leurs projets.La seule chose que je reproche, c'est qu'un joueur plus faible que les autre avantagera systématiquement le même joueur, à savoir celui qui joue juste après lui.
Medina peut se jouer à la fois à l’intuition et au bluff ou à la réflexion pure si on supprime les informations cachées en retirant les écrans. Excellent dans les deux cas.

Very simple game to teach and play; each turn you just play two pieces, but it's all strategy and no luck. Has hidden information, unless you are a card counter (well, block counter). Has a press your luck element, because you want a palace to grow before you claim it, but someone else might claim it first. Gorgeous wooden bits and lots of 'em. This is one of Stefen Dorra's better games, in my opinion, although I do like [gameid=15600] and [gameid=3141].

Nice bits. Fun game. it took me a few games to realise that the game play hinges on reading the playing style of the other players. You need to keep quite a few options on the run in case you are pipped at the post and careful placement can be very important in the end of the game. Recent plays have led me to rais e my rating to an 8.

RATING: 6
A beautiful game featuring several pounds of wooden pieces. Players are rebuilding the city of Medina, and claiming points for capping a palace in each of the four colours. The palaces are built by all the players together, and timing your claim to a palace is the key to the game. Once claimed, your palaces can be increased in value by adjacent markets, stables (goat pens in the German edition!) and city walls. Bonus points for towers and large palaces can also be earned. A subtle game of timing, and quite insidious in places!

Using the BBG rating system I do have to say that I found this kind of boring.  The  game itself is very beautiful and for that reason I did go out and buy it, but eventually I got around to selling it.  

There are plenty of games that I'll probably never play again in my collection which I stubbornly hold onto, but I had no problem selling this, which is unusual for me.

The big problem I have with the game is that it isn't so much about building anything as simply waiting for another player to screw up.  Rather than having a mentality about progress and greater and better things to do with my position instead it was about playing holding actions and waiting for someone else to do something sub optimally so I could jump on their mistake.  Eh... that just doesn't do anything for me.

RATING: 8
Tile laying, but the tiles are wooden blocks. Feels like playing chicken. You must grab the palaces when they get big enough. If you grab too soon, you get few points. If you wait too long, someone else grabs them. The additional mechanics of the villagers and walls gives some extra tension to the game.

The physical building of the city is a nice touch, and makes this game perhaps more thematic and enjoyable than Through the Desert and Oasis, which at least have the camel/market conga line in common.

Tough decisions - but is gameplay diverse enough to hold interest after many plays?  The left-player bonding issue was clearly in evidence in my single play.  If a player is skittish and places their domes early, the player to their left gets huge opportunities to control the board.

Ratings history: 7|8|9|10...............

Highly tactical "playing chicken" city-building game that is the best pseudo-abstract I have ever played. This is a keeper-forever.[/b]

:star: easy to grasp rules ("Play two pieces")
:star: incredibly tough timing decisions (claiming vs stalling)
:star: interesting spatial aspect (expansion vs blocking)
:star: scoring is simple, but challenging
:star: short play-time for such a rich strategy game
:star: gorgeous components; game looks amazing at end of play

- player to your right can limit/enable success
- wall scoring needs to be re-explained to new players
- AP possible

Talk about climbing the charts! My [b]first playing[/b] I rated this a 7 (the game of chicken was weird); my second playing bumped it to an 8 (the game of chicken is challenging); my third playing to a 9 (the game of chicken is fraught with important considerations); my fourth playing to a 10 (richness and tension of all levels of decision-making are astoundingly clever).

My [b]fifth playing[/b] confirmed it as my favorite game for years (until Magic and Agricola game along). A "build the city" game with elegant rules, incredible bits (169 wooden pieces), and wonderful art make for a very enjoyable 45-60 minutes. Strategies must be flexible and the board develops differently every time. Passive aggresive tactics must be employed; trying to outwait and out do your opponents. All kinds fo neat tricks. Such a fantastic game.

Can be overanylyzed, so be careful who you play with. These 'wooden city games' (eg. Kardinal) really grab me. Happy to report that it went over well with my buddies who are competitive, but not hardcore gamers. But they thought it was great and -- without fail -- everyone who plays this a second time likes it better. It grows on you, Medina does...

DEC/14: After all these years, still a fantastic abstract-ish game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A little bit underwhelmed by the predictable game play.  Should I add a palace piece and make something bigger that someone else will grab after me?  Or should I just count the remaining pieces and figure out who will get to place their last dome piece.

Very nice looking but don't know if I'm willing for another try without house rules that would affect the game flow.  Will give it a second chance for a 4 player game so that I get another try.

RATING: 7
["Tile" placement] [4P:7] Nice looking, but frustrating game of building stuff with wooden bits. No tension to the game at all. Discourages aggression; the best strategy is purely defensive. Be aggressive, and lose impressively. Might give this another chance later. *** UPDATE: Thanks to Linnaeus, ekted and Jim_P, got to play Medina again on BSW. Needless to say, the '4' was way off base. Upped to 7, will play again if given the chance. *** UPDATE: What's been bugging me is the lack of theme here. You're just putting down palace blocks and walls, which is fine, but people? And the tower scoring doesn't make a lot of sense from a thematic context. A point off for that. *** UPDATE: Okay, back up to a final rating of 7. This is the best example of a game using "negative timing" to create tension. It helps that it also has fantastic HiG production values. Probably Dorra's best work ever. Definitely worth a look to gamers who are partialy to thinky-type games.

RATING: 7
A great game; build the greatest palaces in the best locations of the city and score accordingly.  I overlooked one rule first time out regarding the proximity of palaces (no diagonal adjacency either - doh!), but the game was still a pleasure to play and a pleasure to look at.

Kicsit nehezen tettem magamévá a szabályt, de mint kiderült nem bonyolult a játék, csak a szabály sikerült kicsit furára. 
Pofonegyszerű körök: két faelem lerakása, és már jön is a következő. Nehéz döntések: meddig építsünk valamit? Mikor vigyünk el valamit? Mikor fogunk arra kényszerülni, hogy mást építsünk? Tudunk-e blokkolni valakit/valamit?
Rengeteg opció rajzolódik, abból a két kis elemi lépésből, és gyanítom hogy első játékra valójában még csak karcolgattuk a felszínt.

RATING: 7
Medina is a game of careful positioning, partly to improve your own position, and partly to not improve your opponents'. Choosing the right time for claiming palaces is about as important as making sure you don't leave any big openings for the player after you. Since there is zugzwang you can even sometimes make other players build what you want.

Medina is a game that probably needs a play to understand how the different pieces interact. Once that's clear, however, not giving unintentional assists to the next player becomes rather easy - unless your moves are forced on you, of course. The game needs this kind of turn angst to work because it adds another dimension to an otherwise rather simple game where the strategy is pretty obvious. Interaction is always indirect but the game uses it to great effect.

A nice little game, with more wooden pieces than I've seen before! The rules are simple but open to a lot of clever strategy which is how I like it. Went down well with my nine-year old daughter, she picked the rules up during the first couple of turns and came in second of the three players.

A game I definitely want to like! It has most of the elements that I love: Great bits, simple rules, tough to master, great strategy. But somehow, it just comes across too dry. I don't know why. Maybe more playings will cure that.

RATING: 8
Medina is such a beautiful game and relatively easy to play, but with tough choices to make. One may feel a bit overwhelmed by the number of placement possibilities to start, but you will settle into it quite quickly after a few buildings get placed. The gameplay is easy to pick up after a short while so in the end you are just pushing your luck, keeping the blocking and optimal placement going and hoping your plans work out! This also works a solid 2-player game, which is refreshing.

This is the definition of a game where you spend most of your time trying not to make a mistake (giving your opponents a good opportunity.)

I prefer games where I try to plan for a good move, rather than those where I simply try as long as possible not to give my opponents any good plays.

Can't wait to play this.  Beautiful production on this one.  

Update: Finally played this.  It took me long enough.  The rules are deceptively simple for this multi-player abstract.  Nice mix of stalling, playing chicken and committing yourself to claim a palace while there is still room left on the board.  Very groovy.

Medina was brought out to close the night. I think it took around 90 minutes. I gave a rather fractured rules explanation, I had read the rules a couple weeks ago. We ended up getting one rule wrong on placement of palaces. Nonetheless, this game has clear similarities to MarraCash. Turn order is again very important, but perhaps not quite as important as MarraCash. There is a press your luck element to claiming palaces. If you claim them too early they won't be worth much, if you wait you could get stuck with a real stinker. There is also quite a bit of conflict over some of the higher scoring tiles that you get from connecting to towers last, or the biggest palaces. There are a number of ways to increase point totals of your palace but this isn't a high scoring point salad game. Each point is quite important. There is also an interesting dynamic with trying to drain other players' pieces so you can continue to place after they're done with all their wood. Another great game that we'll have to play again soon.

Received in the March 2014 European Math Trade. I want to play it more.

This is basically a giant game of chicken, with a hefty dose of tactical twists. Really easy to play (just place two bits of wood each turn), but there's a great danger of intimidating everyone and spoiling the fun if you teach it badly. Best way to teach it would be to score a completed game.

Sold in July 2017, because I bought a second edition version.

RATING: 7.5
Medina is a strange game.  It starts slowly and innocently, but builds to an excruciating tension in the midgame.  The game emphasizes timing, brinksmanship, limiting easy opportunities for the player on your left, staying flexible, and coaxing the development of the board subtly in your favor.

It's very difficult to set up opportunities for yourself since the following players can jump on any juicy situations you create.  That lack of control over your own position will confound many of the "master planner" sort of players, and so Medina is definitely not a game for everyone.  Medina is not the only game with this sort of pattern.  Samurai, Australia, Baumeister von Arkadia, Expedition, Marracash, Cartagena, Titan: the Arena, Liberte, and Modern Art are other examples.  If you enjoy that sort of game, you may want to check out Medina.  But unlike any of those games I listed, Medina has absolutely no randomness.

I enjoy Medina for its strange pace and for the subtle and indirect push-pull effect of players' moves.  The gorgeous painted wood city that develops on the board is another undeniable attraction!

This is a beautiful little game, with play based on "Chicken".  It is close to a perfect information game (as most of your screened items can be deduced through careful observation).  It has player interactions, and a good amount of trade-off strategy (can you wait long enough to force other players to build you a bigger palace?).  Its play is fairly quick, and bonus cards allows some strategizing.  And did I mention that a finished game really looks nice?

The only down side is, like many perfect information games, players with lower skill levels can be left in the dust.  The theme and lack of randomness can be a detractor to many family game players.

RATING: 7
A játékosok együtt építik Medina városát.  Mindenki azonos számú épületelemet kap. 4 különböző színű palotaelemeket, istállókat, falakat és figurákat. Mindenki a körében két elemet rakhat le. A játék lényege, hogy minden palotának egy tulajdonosa lehet és mindenkinek egy adott színből csak egy palotája lehet. Így az időzítés nagyon fontos, vagyis mikor rakjuk fel a tetőt a palotára, mert onnantól kezdve új palotaelemek nem építhetők hozzá. Istállóval, figurákkal növelhetjük értékét, illetve a falakkal összeköthetjük a város sarkaiban álló tornyokkal, megkapva azok pontszámát. 

Kicsit absztrakt játék, de nem túlzottan. Hátránya, hogy csak 3 v. 4 játékos játszhatja. A sok fa alkatrész miatt elég drága volt, de ma már jó áron beszerezhető.

I'm a complete sucker for games with attractive wooden components, and this game has more 'sucker' value than any other. Components aside, this is a tense 'dilemma' game where each turn gives you the choice between scoring points now or increasing the potential score at the risk of someone else taking it. A coffee-table game with angst.

I enjoy this game because you have to take a chance and hope it pays off. That is what some people don’t like about this game, but to me it makes it very exciting. The ability to block opponents offsets this nicely. Someone might take a palace you want and you might be able to block their ability to expand it, making your smaller palace worth more. Very good game.

Elegant, unique, NO LUCK good strategy game with a nice gametime of 60 - 90 minutes

Your only placing 2 things on the board but the tension is ratcheted up here as you either play the 'wait & see' push your luck game or just take what you can when you can, waiting can definitely cost you more times than not but the payoff can be worth it so it is a VERY fine line making for tough decisions. 

It can be a very tricky game, almost sneaky actually as you try to set yourself up. Strategy is subtle and there are also nice tactics and screwage possibilites. Several ways to score add to the things to think about here. 

It is fairly abstract and does suffer from the sitting to the left syndrome so play with equal players. Components are top notch!

Greatest quality wooden bits I've ever seen.  I'm very glad I own this game.  It's pretty easy to get non-gamers to play this one because of its visual appeal.  Gameplay suffers from the "take advantage of the guy to your right" syndrome, however.  It is a very reactionary game - the best plays are usually playing pieces that won't help your opponents, and taking advantage of them when the opportunity arises.

Initial Rating: 7.5 (November 2011)

A very good abstract game. Medina has easy rules, it can be explained under 5 minutes, but the gameplay is very deep and it has no luck in it. You need to exercise your memory (another aspect I like in my games) to remember which player played which piece :). You have to collaborate to elevate the worth of the buildings, but at the same time you are competing to claim it as yours. This dynamic make for very tough choices that I really like.

Another positive point, the game looks gorgeous with all the components in the table. :D In this game you have to exercise your memory.

On the bad side, the game has paper thin theme and that is all the negative aspect I can think of.

I’m downgrading it to a 7.0 because it is a good game I’m usually willing to play, but not one I want to play all the time. Still a very good game that has a permanent position in my collection.

Simple rules... lots of strategy.  This game gets better every time I play.  My rating has actually gone up.  And I still can't win more than one game in five.

The way playing pieces work together for scoring the bonus tiles are almost a sub-game during play.  You never get to do enough on your turn as you would like... it's almost as if Wolfgang Kramer had a hand in the design.  It's Stefan Dorra's masterpiece as far as I'm concerned.

It's basically a game of chicken - picking the right time to claim a palace before another player does, but not so early that it's not worth a lot of points. There are a fair amount of opportunities to screw other players which makes the game fairly entertaining. That, the beauty of the game, and the rarity of good four-player abstracts is why I score this pretty well.

A beautiful abstract strategy game with an Arabian desert theme/motif. Players are rebuilding the city of Medina. The game has all kinds of little goals to go for - walls, largest building, a "conga" line going by your building...

Very original and attractive game.  Players place wooden pieces on the board in varying clusters... waiting for the right time to claim them as their own.  You want to find the structure that has the most opportunity for development.  Then there is a more geometrical aspect as you expand the value of what you own, closing others off and finding nooks and crannies that are still available for expansion.

So, what is Dorra's problem.  He gives us these games where the object is to basically screw your friends.

Looking at Medina from an ideal perspective, it could easily be an 8/10. Strategic decisions of claiming buildings, tactical optimization of playing the right pieces, very nice material - a rich and rewarding multiplayer abstract of gaining positional advantages, seizing opportunities and... unluckily focussing on not leaving opportunities for the following player. 
If only it could! Medina suffers from a very strong left-right-binding. As it is, I only would play it again when I'm sure that either all players are of roughly equal skill or that the player to my right is one of the weak players. Then at least I would know that I lost due to my own mistakes. Realistically, the first case will not happen with the group I'm playing with and in the second case a good part of the potential will not be levied.

Played 3 times... all with the wrong interpretation of when a palace is "complete".  We noticed during our 3rd game that we were playing by the wrong rules!  (We were playing that a palace could be completed by adding a "cap" at a later time -- even if the palace couldn't grow anymore.)

I can't play this without thinking of sisteray's comment on this game (about a game where you don't want to take your turn being 'spiritually broken') and I have to agree in principle.  But I ended up having a lot of fun with the game.  It is definitely a game of chicken, but with further experience it should get much more competitive, as it will become easier to see what could potentially happen in the future.  Initially, we did not anticipate the lack of building space that would occur.  I like all the nice chunky wood pieces, which come together nicely to make a pretty cool cityscape.

Abstract-ish city building game. At the core is a chicken race mechanism, or stalling, if you like - city blocks grow until someone finds them valuable enough to claim - but the particulars and intersections of the scoring system, as well as occasionally aligning player interests, leave room for shrewdness and tension. Also it's very pretty.

The Good: Those who like abstract games with some push-your-luck feel may like this.

The Bad: Too dry and abstract for my tastes. Also, the length seemed a little long for what it is.

Medina is engaging and deeply strategic.  With four players, the quicker crowding of the board makes it tenser than the three player, but also reduces a player's control over his own choices, which some people don't like.  Like Puerto Rico, one beginning or bad player can greatly tilt the game.

After almost two years ownership I played this "tile placement game" Tiles are wooden blocks.

Hard to have a feel for who is winning in the first game. This has to change in future plays or rating might drop.If it changes this might overtake Carcassonne

A relatively old game I wanted to try for long. A very Knizian "tile"-laying game, it's rather abstract but very tense and exciting to the end. No wonder it was released three years after Knizia's tile-laying trilogy but it's different enough to be enjoyable on its own. Also the board with the large wooden pieces looks spectacular in the end!

RATING: 5
This is a game that often needs a play just to understand how the game pieces interact and how the game plays.  Rules are simple but my college group has found it hard to grasp the concept of how to play the game well in their first play.  Each turn you have the opportunity to play two pieces from city walls, palaces, stalls, merchants, and your own palace roofs to claim a palace complex.  Points are scored for each piece of the palace, each attached stall, and each adjacent merchant and city wall.  Additional bonus points are available for the largest palace of each color and the last person to place a wall along an owned palace extending from each tower.  After my second play its not a game that I feel need to keep around as there seems to be little interest from others in playing the game.  Its very much about pushing your luck to develop large palaces and very dependent on others allowing you to do so.  As well, the customers/meeples are very hard to change course significantly and can grant a nice point bonus to those who own palaces around them.  Beautiful to behold, it seems to lose its welcome quickly among many of my friends.

I really like it.  It looks nice, the rules are simple, and there's no luck.  Cooperatively build palaces with the other players, while trying to make sure that the ones that you claim end up the biggest and in the best locations (most recently connected to one of the towers and next to the meeple "conga line").

This game really needs 4 players to shine.

Played only on BSW.  While it suffers from a couple of problems (multi-player chaos, weak player syndrome), the quality of the game dramatically outweighs them.  An excellent game in the same (broad) family as Acquire and E&T.

UPDATE: Played out on Medina a bit, so i'm dropping my rating to a 7.  Still a highly recommended game, but it tends to have a certain samishness after the first few plays.

I love the wooden components.  Some of my favorite though the colors are a bit drab, then again it is a desert.  The colors on some of the cardboard chips are supposed to match up to colors your controling but actually do not.  The rule book English is horrible and repetative.  It could have probably been reduced to about half the size and been more clear.  The opening part of the game can feel as if your actions are quite random and there is no single move that is supior to another until colors start getting claimed for the first time.  The 'meeple chain' is a bit difficult to stop or significantly alter without loosing ground elsewhere.  All this said I want to play again because there is a ton of strategy there once the board starts to come together.

Tons of wood in one box! I love how you are literally building the city as you go. It's visually impressive, but it's kind of hard to get past the feeling that your actions are driven by a "well you did that so i'll do this and get points" mentality. It almost feels like the game plays you. I need more plays to figure it out, because I have to believe that there is more here than meets the eye.

The heavy wooden pieces in this game really make it.  It is an abstract city building game where you are building palaces that will score.  You also build walls and paths for pedestrians.  There are various ways to score and it is a very fun game.

Great components make this enjoyable to play.  The play itself is dry and abstract as the desert setting, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  The tempo here is not my preference:  sitting back and trying not to make the one move too far for your opponent to capitalize on.  I prefer a game that rewards taking actions rather than laying in wait.  Even so, it is a good game and I'd try it again.

Well, my family didn't like it but we only played once and I am sure they didn't get the strategy right away so I think they felt frustrated towards the end having overcommitted their domes early. I may have a hard time convincing everyone to let this one back on the table.

1/2007 Interesting game.  After one 3-player game I'll definatly try this again.  There were lots of apparently smarter choices revealed as the game progressed.  Perhaps 4 players will be better; with probably more pieces on the board and the "waiting out"-element will be more intense/speculative.

Don't quite know what to make of this. It feels like there should be a trade-off between claiming palaces early and biding your time. But this trade-off is totally unbalanced (claiming early seems to be far superior). So maybe I'm simply misunderstanding the game, but currently it's not fulfilling my expectations and as a consequence I don't enjoy it.

Update: The comment below was after one play in 2002. Played it again in 2011, and oh dear, this one had not aged well. Waiting game taken to its extreme. A wide open beginning , where ideally you would be jockeying for position, but you are not. I feel no interest to play this again, not even another nine years from now. Will probably sell it.

Nice wooden bits. I like to see the city develop, just like in `Big City´. Often you would rather skip your turn and see what the other players do, but you have to do something, and that´s very annoying and interesting. Good game.

A great game. Needs to be played fairly quickly for full enjoyment. 

After many plays I really like this one. Tough decisions to make with lots of stalling/brinkmanship going on.

** A word to the wise or otherwise **
This game has a strong left/right relationship and by that I mean that if the player to your right is weak you may be left with opportune placements. Likewise your play directly impacts the player on your right. For this reason this game is best played with players of similar experience and knowledge of the game for best results.

Although, with 298 more plays of Ponte than Medina, I can't say yet where it works better. [gameid=503] is also a good comp. Could this use some of TtD's random setup? Is there some reason this wouldn't work with two? I don't know yet.

An abstract posing as a themed game (sort of like Ponte del Diavolo), Medina is a satisfying and tense placement game. A lot of the excitement comes from deciding whether to make a neutral palace a litle bit bigger, or just claim it before anyone else does. The wooden pieces are really nice.

A great game with nice looking pieces. It gives about the same feeling as Euphrat & Tigris (always just short of one action) but has some other tactics.

I got to admit, the first time I played this, I was thinking to myself quietly I really don't like this.  But after thinking about it, I gotta say it's growing on me.  Problem now is going to be tracking one down.  I think the reason why I would like to get it is that I believe this is a game that my kids might enjoy.  There at that funny age (12ish) where they like to play, but are still learning strategies.

A game of chicken, with loads of gorgeous wooden pieces. The chicken part reminds me of "Boxes".

A lot better than what I expected based on the reputation; It's not really just about the chicken, it's all about placement, positioning, and blocking. 

And the contrast to the usual angst of "always wanting to do more than you can on a turn" is intriguing: Here you often want to use only one action instead the two you are obligated to.

RATING: 8
A load of surprisingly big wooden blocks. Deeper than first appears. Good timing is needed in order to do well and claim decent sized/located palaces, but without leaving it too late that you're left with too few options. Can suffer a bit from stalling where no one wants to set up anyone else.

This game is something else. The all wooden components turn this into a work of art when the game is over. Oh ya, game play. Full Knizia tension but from S. Dorra. 
One can be down-right sinister in their turn if you plan ahead. I have been labled "evil" and "Dick Cheney-Like" many times while playing this game.

RATING: 7.5
No luck piece placement game, with a very cutthroat vibe. This is one of those brain burners that can cause a ton of analysis paralysis if the players do want to win no matter what. We did play the two player variant and it works well, but I can see how 3 or 4 players would work best, as it would make it way harder for someone to calculate everything in advance.

Having played Medina several times now, I'd like to change the comments.  Medina is a very ergo-friendly: great bits, a lovely thing to see while it's being built and while it's being created.  However, the first game will always be a test game for new players, as the game truly 'evolves' over time.  With that said, in (I believe) all of my games of Medina, noone wants to play again after first try - it's seen as a bit of a brain burner with a certain akwardness about it, as sometimes, all you want to do on your turn is 'PASS', but you can't.  Experienced players shouldn't sit to the left of inexperienced players.. It gets weird, mixed reviews because of these things.  It's very different.  Still, it's pushin' 8 for me, because I am keen to play always, and I think that the more you play the more you like it.  Like olives.  Medina is olives.

RATING: 8
Clever game, with beautiful wooden pieces. By making strategic decisions and tactical plays, the players together build a city and manipulate how it grows. I like how you can't really plan or calculate the optimal play, it's more playing by ear, without that lost feeling where you have no idea what you're supposed to be doing. There are a lot of decisions and moves you really don't want to make, but have to, and yet you rarely feel bad about them because you're building this beautiful palace-city.

The Upside:
-A good looking abstract for more than 2 players.
-A nice and healty share of screwage. You can burn and get burned, but only if you set yourlself for it.
-A building game is a plus for me.

The downside:
-It won't fill you with ecstasy after each play, it's dry.
-Sometimes you don't want to take your turn...I don't know if that's what you should want in a game. I don't know many like that, so not a big deal.

The look of the game is really great. I also love the tension created by the fact that you build the palaces in common until one player claims them. A bit of push-your-luck and a bit of aggressive play because you can force other players into small corners.

06-09-2014. Rated after 2 plays. Fun game in which you try to build 4 different kinds of colored palaces. The twist is, you can only own one of the palaces and the building of palaces is communal until you decide to 'claim' it, therefore it's a bit of push your luck (how big can you get it), and a question of good timing. You can then subsequently build a market of people in order to get more points or put stalls/walls down in order to get more points. 

It's a fun.. but very simple game. I like it, but do not need to play this often. A few times a year seems more than plentiful for this game.

Boy did I want to like this game.  I am a sucker for Building games, but sheesh.   The game relies on the other players preventing the leader from getting too far ahead, rather than building yourself up.  The meeples give huge points and you can't do anything to prevent it. Any game that enforces the concept of not ever wanting to take your turn is spiritually broken.  I think that this is my most hated game that I've ever played.

Really solid area-control style game.  What's really cool is that everyone can add to the city with the same set of pieces, but sometimes you're adding to your own palace and sometimes you're really adding to someone else's.  The game's rules are simple, yet the decisions are deep.  An elegant game.

RATING: 7
Medina has a similar feel to Dorra's MarraCash. To win, you have to encourage other players to help you out by manipulating incentives. It's a game of simple rules and difficult decisions. Dorra rarely disappoints. When I played, I won by taking palaces surrounding the markets early. That meant that no one could lay markets without giving me points, which meant that I was free to do other things, including one particularly nasty move to limit the potential for growth of another player's key palaces.

Even with the folks who've played it and genuinely enjoy it.

Ultimately it is an avoidabce game making you feel like you're constantly in "wait and see" mode, which can be fun but I need to be in the mood.

RATING: 8.9
My favorite abstract euro.  Beautiful and captivating game.  Lots of crunchy decisions centered on visuospatial analysis and deductive timing. Players must time their *commitment* to building and/or claiming a given structure in a manner that optimizes its scoring value, and, hopefully at the same time, thwarts those of opponents. 

It pays to be discreet about plans! It pays to devise tempting red herrings! By secretive here, I don't mean in terms of hidden resources (in fact, we usually play without the screens), but in terms of what is going on on the board. Which structures are the ones my opponent hopes to reap points from? (And which are red-herrings?) How can I tempt my opponents into spending a precious claim on a structure that has a lesser scoring potential or that will likely constrain their development in the future?

'Medina' is one of those rare wonderful games that unifies aesthetics and strategy.  It allows you to look upon a finished board and see this amazing physical artifact--a brilliant multi-colored city--that represents all of the choices that were made during play. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I recognize Medina as a very pretty, and even quite strategic, game.  However, more-than-two-player abstracts without any coherent theme aren't really my thing, and this game was very, very dry - If I'm going to play a game with 3+ players, I don't want it to be dead silent the whole time, and I'm not sure I'm a fan of a system where often times you'd give almost anything for it NOT to be your turn.  This game, like Puerto Rico and many others, can suffer from a serious player-on-the-right problem, where an inexperienced player can end up gifting the player after them with wonderful opportunities.

JUN 2009 - Found the rules for 2-player and was able to play a game and turned out to be just as good as a 3/4 player game. Lots of tension and decision making. Loving this game! Raising to a 10!

07 APR 2009 - Played @ GameStorm 11 - I was lucky enough to purchase this from someone else and receive it @ GameStorm. We played it once. Slightly incorrectly, in fact, which affected gameplay. We even placed some of the pieces upside down (should have looked at the example on the box closer) but that DIDN'T affect gameplay. Even though we played it wrong, it was still great fun and we got the general feel for it. MUST PLAY AGAIN!!!!! (Note it requires 3 or 4 players)

Not quite a brain-burner, but the decisions are never easy. Remains tense throughout, with the tension rising as the final pieces are placed. Best of all, despite the beautiful wooden bits and simple placement rules, this doesn't "feel" dry like many abstracts. An extremely solid design that challenges players and absolutely holds up to repeated play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Played once with 4 players (supports 3-4). Very interesting abstract game involving cooperatively putting up buildings and deciding when it is best to claim a palace. Big game of chicken. The game has an awkward beginning, tactical mid-game play and then the end of the game pretty much plays itself, which unfortunately leads to an end-game with little tension. Very nice components. Straightforward game, but the Tower bonus tile scoring can be confusing and non-thematic.

Neat game.  Constant pressing your left, and screwing the people at the table.  Must be played nasty.  It isn't actually nasty play, you are always on the look out to minimize your opponents points.  You aren't stabbing them in the back.  It feels like a Knizia(two actions per round with a few placement rules) but its gameplay has a bit more of an attitude.  Simple clever and fun.  The impact of certain decisions aren't felt for several turns down the line.  Hopefully I can play this enough to start seeing the more subtle effects of moves.  I'm sure that depth is there.

Lategame kingmaking holds it back from being an super game, so it sits the the category of good.

Everything is wooden in this game. It is a placement type of game. Probably the best in its category. The rules are very simple, it goes fast although at times some players may start to think too match. You add two wooden pieces each time and whoever has the best palaces at the end of the game wins. Although the game can be described in one line, it is very strategic and creates a lot of tension between the players. A superb territorial game. My only complain is that there is not a victory point track around the game board so it is easy to count the victory points at the end of the game.

I forgot how much fun this game is - the turn angst per minute ratio of it is tremendous. An old time classic, which doesn't feel dated even in 2011. And it looks gorgeous with all the wooden bits! Probably Stefan Dorra's best game to date - pity it can only be played with 3 or 4 players.

Played once. Impressive brainy game which will not fly with the instant gratification crowd. Simple rules add up to a myriad of possibilties in this beautiful looking block placement game. The sheer analytical heft of this Dorra construction, while it is rewarding, will be a game more admired than played. It is for this reason, I must regretfully dock it a point. Very much an acquired taste which I wish I had the time to get. If you want a heavy duty abstract gamer's game, this is really a good bet. Would rate higher with the right crowd after multiple plays.

RATING: 7
Good tile- (well, block-) laying game with a high degree of brinksmanship. Claim a palace too early and it could score low. Wait too long and someone else will snag it. 

The tension rackets up nicely as the game progresses. Not a game for control freaks.

Forget for a second that the pieces are amazing; this is on its own merits an excellent and unique game. Some people won't like the aspect of "never wanting to take your turn". Indeed, it is ostensibly like a game of chicken, but the decision-space in this game is really interesting.

This could have been the fifth title in the much-misnamed Reiner Knizia tile-laying trilogy, after Samurai, Euphrat und Tigris, Durch die Wüste, and Rheinländer. But it's not by Reiner Knizia... Stefan Dorra has created a tense waiting game. Each turn you can place two pieces on the board, either augment an existing building or start a new one if the current building of that color is as finished as it will ever be. Each player will claim one building of each of the four colors by the end of the game, giving one point per wooden piece attached to said building. Plus, if you own the largest building of a particular color you get a little bonus based on the color you dominate in. Lastly, there are bonuses similar to the color-type for the player who most recently connected one of their buildings to the walls, which grow from the four corners of the city.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's very difficult to judge how to set up a building to force other players to build it up for you, but it's more intuitive how to place the new building to prevent other people from getting too large a building out of it.  It's still challenging, and I'm not sure if I have the skills to know how best to play it.

RATING: 6
An abstract piece-placement game with a city building theme.  This is a game that generally feels like your moves will only benefit the next player, so player turn order does have an effect on the game.  After one play with four players, I don't have a strong sense of whether I'd like it or not with more plays.  In the game I played, players certainly took the strategy of capping five-block palaces.  I would think capping then playing blocks in corners would be a good screwage play.

Rating based on one play; and why have I played this only once? Not sure. Too many other games to choose from, I suppose. Good use of the "chicken" mechanic in that you want other players to place their pieces first, so they won't so you have to place yours in a way that forces them to do so.

Colorful abstract city builder to recreate Medina by placing wood palace, wall and merchant pieces on a square grid common board. The palaces are four colors. Each turn play two pieces. Score for biggest palace with your colored rooftop pieces, be the last to place a wall section next to a tower, proximity to the well, adjacent to walls and the merchant road. Seeing the city develop before you looks cool and is satisfying. Game runs on the lighter side, but has enough to think about. helps to keep track of what pieces are still yet to be played by the other players.

Media is a "push your luck" type of game.  It is a game where the longer you wait to take something, the more valuable it because.  The problem is that it also becomes more valuable to your opponents who might take it before you can.  It becomes a balance of when to jump on an opportunity and when to hold off and wait for something better.  

I personally enjoy this game a lot.  I often don't care if I am winning or losing a game as long as I am having fun with it.  Others in my group are split on this game.  Some love it.  They typically are the ones that are gamblers or enjoy the "take that" type of games where you better your position by harming someone else's.  The ones that don't enjoy it are less confrontational and enjoy engine building games instead.  They don't like the fact that they are building something that isn't their own and might become someone else's (or is already someone else's).  They'd prefer to build on their own economy, even if it was the weakest in the game.  As a result, this game doesn't get to the table that often.

What I do enjoy is that when the game is done, you have a wonderful city sitting in front of you to look at.  Regardless of if you enjoyed the process of creating it or not, it is very enjoyable to see the end result.  

I do agree with some of my group that this game is more "what is the least helpful thing for the other players" rather than "what is the best thing for me".  The heavy push your luck aspect of the game and how it is played forces you to think more along those lines, which for some is not very enjoyable, even for myself sometimes.  

I am up for playing this most of the time if someone suggests it.  The only exception would be if we had already been playing more "take that" types of game.  I need a break between confrontational games to unwind a bit.

This is big game of chicken. Do you wait to claim a section or just grab what you can? Can you get the people around the corner or should you forget them? Are you going to get stuck with pieces, and if so, how do the pieces that will play help everyone? Lots to think about.

RATING: 8.5
Played a few times face-to-face and several times on BSW (with 3 or 4 players). A terribly tense game, where you spend most of the time wishing that you had only one action instead of two. Its main negative point is the high importance of turn order - quite often, the winner is not the best player, but the one seating to the left of the weakest player. Still, among experienced players, the game is really good - and the components are beautiful.

A game with a bunch of cool wooden buildings you use to build a nice looking town.. and building that town is quite enjoyable.  This is pretty abstract, but I found the nice, tactile pieces and largely intuitive scoring to not make it feel as abstract is it might have.  Doing well in the game takes a bit of spatial reasoning and a lot of good timing.  Early palaces can be trouble... but waiting too long to claim points can leave you short as well.

If nothing else you can't help but be happy about the neat city you've built by the end of the game.  Maybe a tad long to be in my Taluva/Samurai/Metropolys rotation... but I think I'll try to bring it to game night often anyway!

Medina is a curious game in that the players usually do not want to take their turns, especially since each architecture extended is another possible point gained for their opponents.  So it isn't unusual to see walls and market being the first to be expanded as a delay tactic.  After all, they are useless for everyone until someone has claimed a palace next to them.

What I don't really get is why the watchtowers are created unequally.  The differing values make no sense strategically and thematically.  It also makes for a big swing in terms of the points awarded.  In contrast, the varied worth of the palaces is exactly the reason why the decisions are so tough in this game.  It's a constant struggle between how do I hold on to the palace tile vs how do I take it away from the current keeper.

Some have described Medina as a game of chicken, but I don't think that's entirely accurate.  You're not awarded for staying in the longest, but rather by bailing out (claiming a palace) at the right time.  I see it more as a push your luck kind of thing.  How big can you extend before another person takes it away from you.  This is a delicious exercise in subtle manipulation and daring expansion.

Cool city building game.  It has potential to destroy the first time player, so I suggest that when playing with a noob, let them know that near the end of the game a lot of space will be covered and scoring will be quite low.  It is an interesting game when played with experienced players and definitely rates a solid 7 with me.
